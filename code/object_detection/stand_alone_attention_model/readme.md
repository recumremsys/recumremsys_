This part contains the implementation of the Stand-alone self attention model in tensorflow.        
This is divided into parts as:-         
**readme**           
**attention** containg the module of attention stem and attention(used in convolutions core blocks)           
**config** containg the arguments we will pass in the command line           
**main** containg the execution of all the functions      
**model** containg the architecture of the model         
**preprocess** containg the arguments that will preprocess the image
