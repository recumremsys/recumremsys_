Nearly killed my husband walking from our accommodation!ðŸ˜‚ Well worth it though as the views are amazing. Donâ€™t do it in thongs!!!
"Agree with what other fellow TA mentioned, it is simply beautiful.Don't drive all the way to the top as I can 99.99% guarantee that you won't be able to park there plus the fun is to walk your way up to the light house.Park at the bottom and leg it. It is a gentle easy walk. Enjoy the view there.Clean toilets. Cafe. Bring coins for parking ðŸ…¿. Be warned it is not cheap, but worth it."
We came here late afternoon after a wedding renewal ceremony & it was just magical.  Beautiful views in all directions.  Whales breaching the ocean below the lighthouse.Great photo opportunities all around.  Donâ€™t miss the spectacular Tallow Beach photo on the way back down from the road.Definitely worth a visit on a beautiful sunny day.
Did the lighthouse walk with a friend one afternoon on a 3 day trip to Byron. Can highly recommend. Itâ€™s a hilly walk of course but very worth it and if you take the longer route its a nice wide clean path (the track through the woods is clear but messier so take sturdier shoes). You get wonderful views of whales breaching and of the bay from up there and itâ€™s a great place to watch the sunset.
Lovely walk and view a must do. Take your runners and walk down to the most Eastern point! You have to pay for parking but you do everywhere
Nice to do the coastal walk up to the lighthouse! Make sure to catch the most eastern point of Australiaâ€™s mainland
"Donâ€™t miss this place when visiting Byron Bay. Amazing views, lovely Cafe, nice walking tracks. A must go!"
Visited Byron Bay Lighthouse which was being painted/restored but had one room for viewing. Great information inside.Decided to do the steps and walk down to the beach. Very easy walk down but a little tough on the way up being a rise of approx 95 metres. Well worth the effort and views.Would do it again.
A lovely place! Beautiful views and we got to see whales! Were really keen for the lighthouse tour (gold coin donation) however it was fully booked which was disappointing! Well worth a visit
A bit difficult to achieve At the top as many other tourists are doing the same thing.Parking up the top was crowded and had to wait for a spot and pay $8.00. The alternative was a climb up the hill. The $8.00 is worthwhile. Parking attendant does a top job.The wander around the light house was good and yes there were whales.The small coffee shop on site is well overdue for a makeover to encourage visitors to stay awhile.
Really nice walk around the lighthouse! Saw some whales! Make sure you bring bincoleours if you have them! Also don't miss the most western point of Australia!
The views are stunning! But they do take some effort to obtain! Ensure you take a bottle of water and a hat. We took the scenic steps route on the way up and then the road on the way back down which was much much easier!
Great walk and amazing view. Saw dolphins galore! Kids aged 9 and 5 loved it too. Would probably do it wearing closed shoes next time.
Great views along the entire walk and once you get to the lighthouse. Bring sunblock and comfortable walking clothes/shoes.
I went up with my 5yr old and she and I really enjoyed the authentic tour. Was quick - not long winded and/ or too much info for kids! Then we walked around the top outside - views were beautiful!!
walked to the lighthouse from central byron bay along the beach and then up the path/stairs.its quite hard going but worth it once you get there. the views are amazing!!
Rewarded with Fantastic views on a long climb to the lighthouse. Cafe at top then less structured path. Trainers advised.
Get up for sunrise well worth the visit. You could struggle for parking and if you park in the lower space you need to pay. Otherwise walk up
Nice lighthouse. Had morning tea at the cute cafe and a wander around.Was very busy despite us being there before it actually opened.
Well worth the walk up to the Lighthouse! Iconic Byron activity. Saw whales and dolphins gliding through the waves.
Loved the view. There is a cafe there as well. Nice walk down to a cute beach. You can park near the lighthouse for free if you have the national parks sticker on your car.
Beautiful walk overlooking the many beaches in Byron Bay. Took us 1.5 hours round trip from Byron Bay centre.
Definitely worth a visit if you are in Byron Bay. The views make this a worthwhile stop. Have a drink or snack at the top and soak in the views and sun.
"Great walk with family. Started at captain cook carpark, nice climb to the light house through the bush. Return via the point and along the beach. First part of track need shoes then down on the beach is was nice to walk in the surf. Go to end of point beyond lookout as the rock formations we're very cool."
Beautiful walk and spectacular panoramic view! Be sure to drive there if you can and bring your swimmers to go for a dip after you do the trek to and from the lighthouse. A must do whilst in Byron! it's not everyday you can say you've been to the most easterly point in Australia.
"I can't believe they are charging $8 to park here! If you have a elderly person with you who can't do the longer walks to get there, you are forced to pay $8 for parking at the top. Seems like everywhere in Byron Bay they are trying to make money with their parking fees. Driving from one place to another, if you are stopping & getting out, more parking fees to pay. I don't know where the money is going, but it seems not back into the roads as they are full of pot holes & are so rough. Whilst the place has great views I won't be going back in a hurry."
Enjoyed the quick visit and regretted not climbing to the top of the lighthouse but recommend a visit to it. Only negative would be limited parking at the lighthouse so maybe park further down the road and walk the rest.
"Beautiful views. We drove and parked a few mins walk away which you had to pay for ($4 per hour). Lovely walk and views - easy trail and great lookouts. No whales at this time of year, but lovely all the same. Ended with coffee and ice creams at the cafe."
"We walked from the Pass to the Lighthouse and back on a Saturday morning. Can get very busy, recommend going early morning. It is quite steep in parts but only 1.7km in total. Take a bottle of water!"
"A MUST when in Byron. On a clear day the views are spectacular.Worth the walk from the Carpark to the top and for the fitter amongst you, go all the way to the bottom. Remember, every step down, equals a step that must be taken back up."
Iâ€™ve been to at least 15 lighthouses in Australia and as lovely as this one is it wouldnâ€™t be in my top 5. Still worth a look if in town. Paying $8 for parking is a bit rich though. But seeing whales close by was probably worth it
"I have to admit, the lighthouse offers stunning views and the view gets even better at sunrise and sunset. However, beware of parking fines - the lighthouse offers only limited parking (about 10 to 15 spaces) and I was travelling with a disabled passenger. Saw about 8 vehicles parked at the lighthouse in no stopping or no parking zones at 6am and stupidly thought that this would be okay.... found a $276 fine (and all the other 8 vehicles too!) - council ranger must have been sleeping in car nearby knowing that many drivers do this with minimal parking available. Anyway - I really enjoyed the view and despite the fine I do still love Byron Bay. Just warning anyone here - beware that parking is taken extremely seriously in Byron Bay."
Such a great view and so many whales frolicking.Recommend early morning or before sunset. Take a drink bottle.
Absolutely wonderful views to be had from the White House at sunset. Make sure you are there at least 15 minutes in advance to get a great spot to see the sunset
"Not a stroll in the park, and some strenuous uphill sections, but well worth the effort and good way to spend a couple of hours if waking from Byron Bay itself. Take plenty of water and sun block even if cloudy as can change to sunny very quickly!"
