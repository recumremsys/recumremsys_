"In my opinion this is not worth visiting or at most you should not spend there more than one hour. Spend more time in China Folk Village, just near Splendid China."
"This place is Huge and you really need around 4-5 hours to explore this even more. See every single place. Must watch the Theatre Show. Walk along the Long river side and see the old villages miniatures along the River/Canal side. Walk till the end. When you enter you find the place smaller but if you will explore the full park, you will see different zones and you should see each and every zone.The wooden bridge and the Big Chinese bridge. The Hill top area and the water falls. This place will make you feel you are somewhere interior in Reginal China. It is worth spending a Full day."
"Why do a tour of China when you can see it all in one day...I have been here twice, it provided great respite from the relentless shopping of Shenzen.  Each time I go I am reminded that there is so much variety and diversity within China, that it highlights there is so much I don't know.  Having said that I am puzzled that Mongolia and Thailand appear to be included in the park, are they really China? Is this historical or aspirational??It's quirky, there are English broadcasts, despite the fact that both times I have been I have not seen any other foreigners.  It's a fun day out, give yourself time, and don't miss the Mongolian horse riding, by far my favourite show..."
"If you want to look at all Chinese marvels in a short time and in a cheap way this is exactly what you need. Mini copies of a lot of Chinese architecture ensembles, from the  famous Great Wall and Forbidden City and up to remote mountain villages and Buddha statues. I was surprised to recognize that China includes not only ""Chinese"" but also ""Muslim"", ""Mongolian"" and a lot of other cultures.The park consists of 2 parts: left from the gates is ""the mini-China"" and right side is Folk Culture Village with a lot of shows and entertainments during a day. Check the schedule on your entry booklet. Both parts are interesting and visit here can take a whole day."
"This is a much better miniature park than window of the world. You get to see three fantastic shows for only 180 rmb as well as see all the famous miniatures of china. Make sure you time your visits accordingly, you will need a whole day here to see everything. Make sure you don't miss any of the three big shows, that's really where you will get your money's worth. The best one I seen so far is the horse riding show, where the battle lead Genghis Khan took place. The park is huge, so prepare to walk a lot. The food at this place is really good and for a fair price compare to some of the other theme parks."
Don't miss this amazing place. You have to walk a lot but you will be able to see not so miniature historical places and monuments from all China.
"Start with hesitation but after spending 4 hours there I'm sure it is worthy to visit.  Don't forget put you on comfortable shoes, sunblock and water.  Hat would be nice preparation as well!"
"Two parks in one, Chinese folk culture village and splendid China If you like culture and learning it is a one day parkDon't miss the middle of the parks fighting arena with warriors Also at the end of the day there is a excellent lights, dancing, dragons and Chinese culture with a fireworks ending. Excellent to enjoy. Pick your seats upon arrival to get your place"
Loved it...I may a little partial because I love China. The visit to this park was a bonus.  Tiny replicas of Chinese history. The details are amazing!!!!!
All that you need to know about Chinese culture. The park is huge so you have to spend one day here. Make sure to watch horse show and cultural dress show. Take photo with Chinese costume will make your visit memorable!
"Be Clear - this is a theme park.  As such its great for kids, not for adults looking for culture!  Also bear in mind once in the food and drinks are expensive compared to local restaurants etc"
"Maintaining is not so good , as long u stay at least 30 Meter from the object it’s OK. Once u getting closer u can see it’s simple and cheap maintained or even just not anymore. It has been really nice , but it’s falling apart ..."
"This is actually two parks. One with lots of miniatures, the other with the culture shows and buildings. Whilst the miniatures were certainly pretty impressive, our youngsters got bored fairly quickly and no matter how many great facts we found out, (the Great wall model is made from 6 and a half million bricks!) we quickly moved on to the culture park. There are some impressive buildings in the culture park and worth a few hours walking around. Make sure you don't miss the Horse Battle at 3:00. This is a stunt show with Mongol warriors, explosions and horse stunts, absoultuely fantastic, similar in scale and production to any Universal Studio show.The 5 'oclock cultural fashion show is also well worth watching, not as boring as it sounds and a well choregraphed show with some unique pieces you won't see anywhere else, such as 17 live peacocks on stage, some of them balanced on top of ladies in impressive regal looking outfits.Unfortunately didn't get to see the evening show.One thing to note. Avoid the two weeks around Easter as this seems to be when all the schools visit all of the sites in Shenzehn. We watched one smaller show with about 600 school kids... quite the experience, if noise is not your thing, then avoid this time at any attraction."
"This a a great place for tourists and residents who want to escape the city for a little bit. Costs about 200rmb to enter, but that includes the China Folk Villages. Make sure you have at least 4 hours to spend there, there is a lot to see! Miniature villages, outdoor art, botanical gardens, local artisans. Easily accessible by subway."
"This park Is so big. You can choose the train to go around the park.  You need only a day to go around the world. From Asia, Africa, America and even Europe. Find the perfect spot for your photos as if you were there. If you want to see this park in 360 degree, go to the ""Eiffel Shenzhen Tower"". Feel the sensation to be in narrow tall tower and spectacular view not only the park but also HK in a distance. Bringing an umbrella, hat and sunglasses is a must during the summer. Don't miss their spectacular performance too. It starts at 7pm. Some food stalls and restaurants are also available there"
its a very big park.  I suggest you spend 1 or 2 hrs at the miniature park and the rest of the time at the cultural village.  There are lots of performance at the cultural village thru out the day.  Don't miss the 3D movie.
"Most people don't know about this place and it is definitely one of the must sees when in Shenzhen. The park offers great opportunity to immerse in Chinese culture without travelling through China. The exhibits are well done, the ground is spacious with electric bikes and shuttles on offer to make the coverage easier and more convenient. The grounds offer food and refreshment facilities and public toilets. The park further offers many spectacular shows, in the very Chinese 'more is more' theme. Do go to visit."
great and splendid performance and quite a feast to the eyes with beautiful costumes and props. Does not get boring as the stage is changed many times throughout the stage performance. Highly recommended.
"Visited here prior to departing Shenzhen, interesting and you can fill 2-3 hours in quite easily. Limited places to eat however."
"I really love this place. If you have visited Window of the World, this place really recommended after that. Located in the same area with Splendid China, you can get in with the same ticket (RMB 200 for both). In this area you can enjoy performance from some China's folk. Don't forget to open their website to check performance each folk."
"Compare to Window of the world this park is below than the previous one. However as I mentioned it's an aye opening for all things about Chinese culture.The staff even dressed & sang a cultural song for you. Nice for those really interested in local culture.The price was RMB 180, it's only cheaper by RMB 20 compare to the window of the world park.However the buggy rent a lot of cheaper than inside the window of the world."
"It's a mixture of theaters, shows, exhibitions and an amazing miniature land. Didn't really know what it was, but some nice business partners took me there. And it was amazing, specially the miniature land which is best reached by the small train. Very well made and rather big"
great place to learn about culture and traditions of China. Make sure to have enough time for walking around and for splendid shows they organize. it was a big surprise that in the evening they organize water battles. it looks amazing both at night and during daylight times
"This venue has things for everyone.  From shows, to simulated fighting, and lots to see and do.  Assorted souvenirs as well as typical Chinese snacks are offered.  Gives a nice overview of a Chinese Folk Culture Village.  Very near OCT."
a very nice park demonstrating a little bit of what China is all about. Do not take the mini electrical car because it goes very fast and you will not be able to actually see anything. Better is to walk
This place is huge and beautiful. Put on your comfy shoes if you want to walk to the end of the park. I highly recommend you walk to the end of the park as every corner have its own miniature of China folk culture. Its Instagram worthy scenery!The culture show was fantastic and entertaining. Highly recommended for everyone to watch the show.
The park is indeed splendid. It's vast and one needs time to take it all in. The exhibits are very well constructed and presented. Attention to detail is evident everywhere. We enjoyed the gardens and the lake but weren't able to see any of the live shows due to time constraints. Give yourself a full day and enjoy the food too. Great candy for the sweet tooth.
My wife and I spent over 6 hours and still missed some of the sights here as the sun went down. Lot's of walking. A great display of the sights of China. The Terracotta Soldiers display was very cool as was the great wall. Plan on taking over 100 pics. Get there early! The food is very reasonable. We also learned the shops that sell traditional clothing will negotiate so don't take the first price offered.
"200 rmb per person. I think kids and seniors get a discount. The park is well maintained but you will for sure see some tacky things like mountains made of plastic, but hey, you're in China.The park takes you through the many different cultures in China and shows you how they lived and live. A lot of the signs are translated to English. Shows are performed everywhere, and signs tells you when they start.Another part of the park contains a lot of miniatures of famous Chinese placed, quite nice actually. The big gardens are also very nice and well kept.3 hours is definitely enough. Water and food can be bought everywhere for reasonable prices. Toilets can be found everywhere. Remember to bring comfortable shoes and an umbrella that gives you both shade and protection from the rain."
"It is not perfect but I wouldn't miss it. We hired a golf cart type of thing as we were short on time. Drove by houses and looked at how they used to live. Cute kids on school trips in uniform running around. Missed the folk shows since they are only in afternoon! There is a souvenir shop with some chinese dresses, shoes etc. Was fun!"
"If you have a very limited time, but you also would like to know the China people, tribes, villages, etc...in 1 place, then I HIGHLY recommend this place. It is a huge place, please prepare 1 day to go, good in morning & afternoon time. Bring also your small umbrella and drinking water."

Well worth a visit. Very close to the metro with good directions. There is a lot of walking and lots to see. The shows are excellent. Make sure you see the horse riding and don't miss out on the mask changers!The food was very traditional.
"Very short business trip and a friend suggested we visit this place.  Being able to see some of the wonders of China in miniatures was amazing, but the cultural shows, donkey carts and actors embedded were such nice touches.  Strongly suggest get a cart because it gets hot and it's a big place."
"Make sure you have at least 4 hours to spend here. It costs about 200rmb per adult. For those less able/inclined to walk, you can rent electric golf carts of various seating number to drive around. I did this with my mom, it was very comfortable. There are cultural displays, homes, costumes, shows with song and dance from many different tribes/minorities of China. It's a good overview of China, and connected to Splendid China Park, which has beautiful botanical gardens and outdoor art."
