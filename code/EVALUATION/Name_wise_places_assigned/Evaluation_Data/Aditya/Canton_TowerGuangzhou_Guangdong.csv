Beautiful tower especially at night when its lighted up. Did not go up to the tower but enjoyed taking pictures from the ground.
"Great place to experience Guangzhou city and not to be missed event especially at night. Do enjoy the changing of colours of the tower as well as the beautiful lighting in the surrounding buildings. At the site, you can also view and walk to the public library which is so artistic and modern. At the tower, there is a mall and plenty of food for you to try. Do enjoy!"
"Always use to walk there with friend or solo when have free time, get away from work and city life.., also good place for show friends who visiting Guangzhou, beautiful view, location in center! Have mall and many restaurants near."
Offers beautiful view of the city. Amazing to see the tower when lights are on. Has an amazing display electronics
Spectacular views of Guangzhou. Recommend visiting towards end of day so you can also see city lit up at night. Liked the “bubble ride on edge at top of tower.
Recommended to everyone! You can visit the Canton Tower at night to see the colourful lights or during day!
"This place around Canton tower ia amazing. Big park, underground shopping mall, restaurants, walk by the river. Be sure to come during the night, while everything is shining."
"Jogged to the Tower from Ramada Pearl, about 1km away. Good eateries and some shopping around. if you want to, go up the observation deck for a bit to take a look at the city from a high. some tight security so just be mindful."
Came here on a cloudy day - view was on unclear. Ticketing isn’t very clear and is confusing. I purchased tickets that seemingly included everything then when I was in queue - was told not included and “CANNOT” even add-on (for the peak view). The top view is in the tower of the Thrill Ride. The thrill ride was quite disappointing but the 5 seconds view above was stunning. Need to purchase the most expensive ticket of $398. The tower does not have clear directions. An external visit of the tower is sufficient.
"Need booking online for bubble tram, sky drop and after for boat. Now in China for each hot spot, better booking b4, some time 3 days .. Forbidden City"
"One of the main sights in Guangzhou! To see the city from above especially in the evening when all the city lights are lit up! And there are many souvenirs and also 2 attractions. Have been in two. One of them the drop is very frightening and your adrenaline gets high, but it was unforgettable"
It’s an amazing tower. Looks wonderful in night with Color changing lights. Beautifully decorated.Must watch
"Love the view at night time , we really recommend to everyone here . A bit expensive 290¥ Chinese currency .  Must calm for making a role following the line as more local Chinese people there.  Waiting more than an hour a line. Love this place ."
Great way to see Guangzhou. Recommend the ride on the roof . Easy to get to and very well organised. Highly recommended.Haysam
Seems to be one of the newest landmarks in Guangzhou. Beautiful place especially when all lighted up by night.
"Did this at night the first time to get the night time skyline for photos and the line was a solid 40 minutes to get to the inner/inside observation deck.  Came back next day to go to the top, outdoor deck and ride the infamous ""orange spheres of death!""  Worth the time and wait.  Very cool.  Elevator down is GLASS DOOR and on the side so make sure you are the last people/person in."
"I loved my visit to Canton Tower.   Easy to access from the metro station and would advise going quite early in the morning to avoid the queues as it does seem to get very busy.  Buying tickets was very easy and we went to the 108th floor. There are higher areas and attractions that can be visited at an extra cost - but the 108th floor was high enough for me !   Lovely views of this enormous city from the tower - all very well organised with high security presence, and elevator attendant.   Enjoyed coffee and cake on the 107th floor coffee shop while admiring the wonderful views."
It’s iconic tower in Guangzhou downtown. See it from different views. I found best from Four seasons hotel’s 99th floor.Lighting is amazing. Worth the see
"Breathtaking view of this 600m tower, the lights change adding to the glamour. Has eating places below and prices for viewing range from 150 yuan ( per Adult) to 398 yuan depending on activities you pursue on the top of the Tower. Please take note ... no tickets without passports so carry your passports. I enjoyed the views from the outside and this is totally free .... have a wide angle lens ... or go pro with a selfie stick to get whole tower in the frame A must see and also 5 minute walk to Pearl river"
This is a must visit place in Guangzhou. Go in the evening to enjoy the lighting show.Please avoid going on public holidays.
"Its the 3rd tallest free standing structure in the world.  Day view on top was stunning,  Night view from outside was beautiful.  There is only one small portion of glass bottom view.  Was expecting more glass bottom area.  Nevertheless, the view is still awesome."
Visit there at 615pm. Find yourself taking lotsa of selfies as light interchanges.Then go over to Hua Cheng Da Dao to find some nice dinner.After which stroll around and find yourself taking more selfies from afar the tower.
"A popular attraction. Crowded is expected. We did not going up to the observation deck, we just enjoyed the colorful lighting decoration of the tower. A good photo spot.Visited on June 2018."
Was here for the fair and did a bit of sight seeing. The canton tower is good. We went during the day and the visibility was not great. I think because of weather and also pollution. All and all very good. Souvenir shops are good.
"Headed to Guangzhou after our Zhuhai trip and first stop was this Canton Tower or the Guangzhou Tower on top. Its not so attractive because we went there in the middle of the day and its so hot. we cant get a nice view of the tower thus, went to a nearby park to get a view of the tower. our tour guide it would have been beautiful if we were there in the evening because of the lights. Nonetheless, it was an attraction in Guangzhou worth the visit"
"I great stop on a tour of Guangzhou. Have a beautiful view of Guangzhou from the top of the tower, especially at night. Up at the top you can also take a ride on a bubble car that goes round the building or for the brave, try the Sky Drop."
Great heights! Great views of the city of Guangzhou. Don’t miss this place if you’re visiting! Canton tower is one landmark that will give you a clear Birdseye view of the entire city.
"Go straight and get 488M tickets to experience the best view. You will avoid all the crowd in any of the lower view deck. They only allow 40 people on the highest deck. If you can afford the price and have time, purchase all in 1 ticket, RMB398. Try to get a Chinese friend to purchase advance ticket online to avoid long queue and sold out timing. Do remember that online ticket require your full name according to your passport. And BRING your ID to enter. You can do the Ferries Car, Sky drop, access to all the deck. But do plan your time, each access is one time only. For example, we wanted to get pictures of the view during sunset and night view, we had to stay on the 488M deck the whole time. We couldn't do the ride and go back up. When we came back down, the queue for the Ferris wheel was too long. Too bad it was a bit hazy the few days we were in GZ. If not, it's so spectacular!Avoid any China holiday period! It was the National Day Holiday when we were there. We couldn't even get to the train station to get out of the island. Luckily we found out they provide shuttle buses at RMB5 to the nearest station!"
"The tower has a 360 view of the whole city. It is very nice to just sit in their cafe and relax.They have restaurants in the basement, ground floor and even on the top! The top restaurants were quite expensive. It was fortunate that there was a McDonald’s on the ground floor. :)There is also a glass floor area for picture taking. Be sure to bring a long selfie stick!For those interested in construction/engineering, they also have an exhibit of the Canton tower construction.The faces in the photo are the ones in front of us so we covered their faces for privacy."
Went with friends.  The view and the parks around are good.   We arrived at 9pm.   Walked around to the stadium and river.  Took pictures.  But at 10pm.  Security closed the park.  We went to the tower base.  It was under renovation so we left.
"Having visited Guangzhou on business my guide persuaded me to go up the Canton Tower, I don’t have a head for heights and wasn’t looking forward to it, it was okay but not really for me. The little mono rail that runs round the top is a bit rickety for my liking and the way it teeters on the edge is a bit unnerving, quite glad when the experience was over, having said that the views were pretty good from the top."
"Is the symbol of Canton (Guangzhou)! Beautiful and lighting in any circumstance.From the big square, visibile everywehere and from where see Canton is simply an experience!"
One of the venue u need to visit when u are in gz. visit the tower at 4pm spend two hours to tour the amaing sight of the whole guanghou. if u like a little of fun go to the top of the tower n have a cable car ride.Service staff friendly n also there to seek assistance. u can have a drink n buy some sovenior in the lobby.

"Went to the xiao man yap, Canton Tower today . Checks were strict due to covid. Masks, temperature taking are a must. Tickets are personalized with name and passport number printed on the tickets. There's 3 rounds of ticket checking before reaching the tower. Everything was smooth and fast although there was some jostling and shoving during the quene for the lift. However this is typical of daily situation in China so behave accordingly to maintain your place in the quene. To get the best value for your tickets, go up around 6pm, hang around until 630 pm and join the quene for bubble tram to be on the tram just in time for sunset (sunset is now 705pm daily in summer but check the timing to be sure before you buy the tickets). With this timing, you get to see daylight, sunset and night time with 1 ticket price! I would also suggest reserving tickets 1 day in advance to avoid disappointment."
"To see the whole city, this is the place to go.  Third highest tower in the world, the Canton tower marks the center of the city. Surrounded by parks and walkways, it is a very nice spot."
