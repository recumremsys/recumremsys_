Going to Chimelong Safari Park was the highlight of our trip to Guangzhou!  The animals are well taken care of and were super active when we arrived that morning!  The employees were so welcoming and seemed so happy to be there!  Please do not miss feeding the giraffes.  The park is blessed to have the only panda triplets in the world!
"We have been to Chimelong Resort Safari Park many times as a Guangzhou citizens. The park has an awesome layout. It has five different parts with heaps of animals! That means no matter where you go, you will have lots of fun. Don’t worry about getting tired while walking around this huge park, because you can always catch a ride on one of the many electric cars that drive around the park. There are many fun activities to do. First, if you are brave, you can pet some tigers. Also, there are many animals you can feed with food provided by the staff. These activities cost extra of course. One thing to be aware of is, you cant bring food into the park. There is food available in the park. However, it is pretty expensive. It might be a good idea to eat a meal before going, to save money. We definitely recommend visiting this park if you come to Guangzhou!- Anna & Coco"
"Our main goal in going to Chimelong was to see the panda triplets but we were delightfully surprised with how wonderful the park was. It was expansive, with so many different animals. It was also very clean with many restrooms. This is a good day trip especially for families with young kids. I suggest you go on a weekday to avoid the crowds. Don't miss the Chimelong circus in the evening."
"Visiting the zoo was a pleasant experience as it is spacious, new and well organized. But it is too crouded (maybe because we went there on Saturday). We had to queue for about an hour for the cable car and more than half an hour for safari. It was a bit annoying, but it is the problem of all similar parks."
"This place is a must-go if you stay in Guangzhou! We were kind of hesitating specially after checking the entrance fee but we decided to go and I'm very happy we did. It is more crowded and ofcourse more expensive on weekends and also I don't know how its gonna be on summer because we were there in Mid October and it was like hot!  Also there is a great deal of outdoor walking. Make sure to wear something quite comfy, have full charge of camera or Cell phone and get prepared for the most exciting experience ever!The animals are so close to take picture with and the safari bus tour is beyond imagination! Do not miss this place specially if you have kids."
"Chimelong Safari Park is the best zoo/safari place that we have been so far, and we have been to plenty! Regular adult fare is 250 RMB while a child's fare is 175 RMB. But for some reason, we got a special fee of 500 RMB for 3 people (regardless of adult or child). Take note that Chimelong Safari Park has 2 entrances. If you are residing in the nearby Chimelong hotel, they will drop you off at the South Entrance. I suggest you do the Gondola first, and then the Safari tram ride. Upon entering the South entrance, you will need to walk about 5-10 minutes to the Gondola station. It opens at 10:30am i believe. And there's an Express Lane if you are a Chimelong Hotel guests. It can be useful especially during the peak season when there's a long lineup to use the Gondola. Anyway, there are 2 lines, one is going straight to the North Entrance, called the Swan Lake Line, and the other is the Circle Line, which basically goes in a loop and you're back to where you started. After taking the Gondola ride, you can go do the Safari tram (wheels) next. Try to stay on the RIGHT side as there are more animals to see there. The animals are amazing! There's not only 1 or 2 of them, but a whole family/herd of them together (ie. 8 lions, 6 rhinos, 40+ giraffes, etc.) The tram ride takes about 30-40 minutes and it takes you up close, especially to the herbivore animals. We also entered the Jurassic World, which was just alright for me. We were on a hunt for a decent restaurant for lunch, but it was a LONG LONG way from the Jurassic entrance. By the time we got to the restaurant, we were famished! We also found the food prices steep, but i guess what's normal for any theme/zoo park. We also went to see the pandas. There are 3 of them, triplets actually. They just sit there and munch on some bamboos. Nothing much going on in their pods. You can also feed some giraffes (RMB 30 for a tree branch!!, which was a ripoff) and also feed some elephants bananas. Overall, i'm amazed by this zoo. It's huge and lots of varieties of animals and you can see that they're all well-fed and relaxed in their habitats. Definitely a must-see with your kids when visiting Chimelong resort."
Tthis is one the best Safari parks i have visited in my life.There were way too many animals in the safari..The safari ride was also unusually good. There were plenty of 4 d shows and other attractions too.I loved the pandas . saw them in abundance..pretty large park and lots to see...one needs a whole day to have fun with your kids at this beautiful park..
This is a huge park where animals are cared for amazingly well and are not stuck behind glass.  They are expansive spaces to live and roam in.Feeding the animals was amazing for our girls and a join to watch the interaction.No food can be taken into the park and we didn't actually eat there as we were too busy trying to get around the whole park.  Make sure you go when the park opens as it can get extremely busy even on a week day.Worth a visit if you love animals
"the park is great.nice and 5 stars graded zoo.we went during cny which is china's biggest holiday. the crowd was massive and we can't really view the animals well. we were fine with it till the white tiger's closure. the crowd pushes so much that 1 kid almost fell inside the den! the staff shouted and the daddy who gives the piggy ride too was furious! the unknown pusher was nowhere to be seen! the next incident was some kids threw her balloon giraffee to the panda!the monkey feeding area was disastrous! we saw cigrattes and other rubbish inside their closure!!!!then, we even saw a grown up girl (about 6-8 years old?) pee on the floor with the urine flowing down the pathway (the mother actually encouraged her to pee on the hill) it was a pathway with not much crowd but there are people walking past them n they just do it without bother! toilet was like not far from that spot too. After that, we realised every pillar at the resting area is wet even though it is not raining. was it pee or what.. we simply don't know.dont get me wrong but my family love the park and the animals look healthy and the park was well kept. just the crowd we depised of. im giving 5 stars cuz of the healthy animals and amazing landscape for their closures."
"The pandas, the dinosaurs and various animals are waiting for you. A whole day is needed to experience all the amusement locations in the park. This park enjoys a nickname of Guangzhou Disney World of Animal Kingdom. Bring your children to here, they will definitely love it."
"A big zoo! Nice safari park where visitors could get quite close to wild animals. Even better if we were to rent a car and do a self-drive inside the safari section. With that perhaps we could spend more time and had more stops with nice pictures. The park was also very spacious with nice layouts. Plenty of clean toilets around. Free wifi facility everywhere was a bonus especially for tourists. Go for a visit if you dont mind about how they practise vast breeding of wild animals! If you could overcome this issue, then, this is one of the best Zoo/safari parks we have visited so far ( although we have not visited too many ! :) )"
"Was amazed by how big this safari zoo is. We entered from the south entrance and took the free cable car to the north entrance where we experienced the safari on wheels (free train ride). In total we took the train 2 times and it was very much worth it with the number of animals we can see along the way. The encounters are quite close as well. Do take note all the introductions by zoo guide on the train is in mandarin. They have a huge pandas enclosure where the famous triplets (characters in Kungfu Panda 3) are housed. There are feeding experiences as well for giraffe, bringing us up close. Overall loved the safari trip and highly recommended in Guangzhou."
"Had an amazing time at this park. Fun safari type ride. Kids got to ride and feed elephants, pet Koalas. Saw great shows. Would go back in a heart beat."
"The safari park is amazing! A great zoo, but way more than that. The cable car and train and worth the whole price of admission. Even as English only speakers we had no problem. Staying at the chimelong hotel was a big benefit...express line for the big experiences."
"The park has an awesome layout. It has five different parts with heaps of animals! Don’t worry about getting tired while walking around this huge park, because you can always catch a ride on one of the many electric cars that drive around the park. We definitely recommend visiting this park if you come to Guangzhou!"
"Had a perfect day in there.For the hole day I forgot I was in China.The place is 100% clean, welcoming. Staff will help you always, you have panda triplets, baby lions and kangaroos and much more... what else do you need?! And price is ok for everything they offer."
"Took a taxi from my hotel and unfortunately he brought me to Chimelong Paradise Park which is an amusement park for children cost of $250 rmb.  After I entered the park and realized it's not where I wanted to be I walked a short distance to the Safari Park.  Not many people speak English so you have to be adventurous to do this on your own without a tour.  Although, it's manageable if you are good with hand signals and directions.  Safari park was $300 rmb on a Saturday.  The park is great and a lot of animals to see.  If you're guiding yourself by the map realize that on the left is for you to drive or take a park shuttle versus to the right is you walk through the park.  The pandas are in a plexiglass enclosure so hard to get great pictures but they are so cute and fun to watch.   It cost me $55 rmb from my hotel and when I left the park the taxi driver charged me $120.  I paid it because there weren't a lot of taxis to choose from."
Spent a day here and thoroughly enjoyed myself. The Safari tour was impressive. The animal facilities were first class. Not to mention the Baby Panda Triplets.
"Beautiful place, well kept, interesting and fun safari, mainly for kids. Was great driving our car inside and also important to choose the right time to avoid too many people. Unfortunately, no good food to be found inside so, better eat and go on a full stomach."
"The best zoo, I've ever visited. Animals are so fluffy, so beautiful, so clean!!! I have no words to describe my feelings. Must visit!!! You will start from monkeys, pandas and koalas, later use trap cabins to have a look from birds sight and use a train to be as much closer as it's possible to wild animals. If you want you can use vip cars to spend more time with tigers and bears in safari zone. My best wishes to this zoo and animals. Enjoy your time!!! And please go there for a whole day! Even 4 hours are not enough for enjoying!"
"Been several times with visiting friends and family, highly enjoyable day out with plenty of interesting animals to see, especially the white tigers, really quite beautiful. It's a big park so you definitely need a full day. Getting there is easy as you can take the metro and also taxi drivers will all know the place as well. Food is inside is generally okay if somewhat overpriced."
We went to Chimelong Safari Park with our 5 year old and two year old sons. They had a lot of fun seeing the animals up close riding the truck train. Make sure to sit on right side as most of the animals were on that side.They enjoyed the tram across the safari park.Lots of walking to see all animals and shows.Bring water to cool down and snacks to eat.Each animal exhibit exit goes conveniently goes through a gift shop.We recommend visiting the safari park.
Great Safari park to visit if you are in Guangzhou.  Have been on the tour a couple of times over the years.  Highly recommended.  Get in a train like vehicle pulled by a truck.  Get to drive through various terrains featuring numerous animals throughout the world.
"Pandas, more pandas. I would call it a panda themed zoo  ;) very well sectioned and upkeep was high rated. Love the safari on wheels and cable car rides. A large park, do expect some walking for more coverage. Make good use of the cable car as you catch an eagle eyeview while riding along the lines drawing almost the entire perimeter of the park!"
"What a place.. Hats off to Chimelong team, how wonderfully they have maintained such a huge space inside the busy city of Guangzhow, life time experience, so many wild animals at arms throw distance, china is amazing country and so its people are. Loved the park.. its a must visit."
"We enjoyed a great day at the Safari park.  Took a metro from the airport to the stop where we got off at Exit E and took a bus to the park.  It is very BIG with a lot of trees and shade, which is great so you don't get sun-burned.  The safari itself was about 40 minutes in a train like car where we saw big animals including giraffes, elephants, tigers, zebras, kangaroos and also koalas, birds etc. There was also a cable car where we could see the animals from above.  There were also the rare white tigers and an area with pandas.  We were able to see the pandas playing.  There was a mini-mono-rail and also some rides in one area.  This included, for example, a log ride with water, a spinning pumpkin and a race-car etc.  The children enjoyed this as there were no ""scary rides"".  Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking,  Although you pay quite a bit for the entrance fee (based on height - child or adult), everything is included in the fee."
"Expecting wide open countryside we (a group of 15 over 50's) were surprised to arrive at the park still in suburbia. It was very hot and humid but once inside the park there was a lot of tree shade along with fans and fine sprays of water to keep us comfortable. The non-railed train ride around the enclosures was OK if you were sitting on the far right - as most animals were able to be seen from this side. If seated in the centre or far left there were few photo opportunities hindered also by people standing to take photos. The commentary was only in Chinese, excessively loud and seemed never to take a breath. Chinese children shouting over the top made the noise level almost unbearable. Poor animals. The enclosures appeared to provide quite free movement but electric fencing was there almost out of sight.Once in the pedestrian part of the park there were caged animals and, like their enclosure counterparts, appeared bored stiff but it was extremely hot and very humid. There were shows in different areas, - feeding tigers, Asian Adventure, African Adventure, Elephant show (cancelled due to refurbishment of their arena). If I sound biased I understand the purpose of some zoos and the need to keep the animals occupied but, along with many in my group we do not like 'animal shows' and wonder about the type of training used. The general opinion from the group was that the whole set up was geared for children. The main attraction for us was the pandas. We viewed the world's only panda triplets. All lazing on massive blocks of ice. No sign of wanting to play today!Lots of walking; a few restaurants and cafes - some quieter than others. Loud, out of context music on every corner, clean toilets with a choice of squat or pedestal -HALLELUJAH !Much more commercial than say Australia Zoo and obviously geared to make as much money as possible."
"Had the chance to visit this huge park. I totally loved the beard, pandas, wolves, snakes among many other animals. This is an amazing place to go with or without children."
"Went to the Safari Park and had a good time.  This place was recommended so we decided to go.  Once we were told we could see pandas, my interest was definitely peaked.  There are a lot of animals at this park and one should start off with the train ride.  We then saw the koalas and pandas.   Entrance fee was 250 CNY per adult which I thought was a bit steep but the place is still worth checking out."
Had a great time. No miserable looking animals. Although the park people do get the animals to be active by teasing food. It was a good experience. Got to see the panda triplets!
"The park is huge and houses a wide array of animals in well-kept enclosures. When visiting, I would highly recommend taking the train ride which gives you a comprehensive view of most of the animals. Do take the glass-bottom cable car ride as well to view animals from a height. It'll lead you straight to the panda enclosure. Do note that outside food is not allowed. If visiting the park with elderly or children, it is wise to take the buggy for 30 yuan/person to avoid walking long distances."
"It has two cable car routes.  We took the route to travel around the park.  However, it was on a sizzling hot day, so we did not see the animals which are supposed to be offered to the cable car passengers to see, except the safari and the swan lake.It offers wheelchair and baby trolley rental services, so it is suitable for the elderly and toddlers.For the walking trail part, it is narrow so the car services cannot approach those animal captivity places.  Walking around is the wise choice for seeing the animals in the captivity part."
"Huge safari park. I did not imagine myself getting so tired this much in my life. Going around the park is exciting but so exhausting at the same time. Visit the place during cold weather. I also wonder why panda's, kaola's and tigers are all asleep during day time. U cant enjoy them. Too bad! I go all the way to China just to see them, but they are all sleeping. But overall, the safari is great. Kids will surely enjoy the place."
"Visited the place twice during our stay in Guangzhou. Unfortunately, both times were during summer, making it really tiring. Animal enclosures are maintained quite well and if you plan right, you can catch a few shows as well. My daughter enjoyed it a lot."
"Be prepared to spend time here and enjoy the animals and parks. Lots of different animals to see and activities for kids. Staff are well trained and depending on season, this place is well known for the crowd. For us, it was perfect timing and weather."
