"This place tells you the history of Lucknow especially in the last 150 years. The  British Residency has within its walls, the graves of British soldiers who died in the Revolt of 1857. The people of Lucknow tell intriguing stories of the ruins. The British Residency of Lucknow serves as a government office. The Residency also has a museum that is well-maintained by the authorities. Youâ€™ll also find the tombs Sadat Ali Khan, who was the first Nawab of Awadh, Kaisarbagh Palace and an observatory built for Colonel Wilcox, who was a British astronomer.This place is spread across many acres. Be prepared to walk."
"It is a legacy of the times gone by and what Lucknow was prior to Independence. A must see for a tourist. Don't be surprised if you catch a few ""love birds"" but that won't take away the magnificence of the place. Believed to be haunted. Not seen a ghost personally."
"A story of 1857 revolt by our own freedom fighters, a must see place to understand the history of Lucknow during British regime. See the museum and go around to see the  architecture of building made by ""lakhori"" bricks, graveyards of the British who were killed during the coup. Best to read about British Residency before visiting there, and if possible get a Guide ,who will explain you in detail.Keep some time to see it."
Parked in the middle of Lucknow city and is the preserved ruins of the first war of independence. The area still has the building which were destroyed in 1857 along with some massive cannons. One should note that the museum is closed on Friday
"Located about 6 km from Lucknow's Charbag railway station lies an area seeped in past history, called Residency. A large british garrision which became famous in 1857 as it served as a refuge for over 2000 british soldiers during the mutiny during the four & half month seige. Today past ruins n many graves remain and the place has been given a heritage status. Well maintained with lovely lawns. Worth a visit."
"The British Residency has an aura of its own. Open from Sunrise to sunset, this place offers a good walk amongst the monuments. You need a vivid imagination to recreate the seize laid down by Indian soldiers who held British as hostage for quite many daysA small museum with portraits of Nawabs and British residents, is closed on Mondays. Ideal time to visit is early mornings or evenings in summers and during afternoons in winters. Tickets are priced at Rs. 15/- per head. If you are a foreigner, you have to pay Rs. 200/-"
This is a stunning set of buildings telling vivid story of the 1857 uprising.The place is very well kept and has a nice museum too. Must visit. Keep aside at least 90-120 minutes for this.
A beautiful place for monument lovers amidst the hustle and bustle of city life of Lucknow. You can find a good dose for your eyes as well as for camera. Try it on week days when number of visiters are less. You can communacte with the walls of British era. The museum inside The Residency narrates the entire story of 1857.
"This is the place where the mutiny of 1857 started. The tell tale signs are visible all over the ancient buildings. Built from 1775 to 1800 to accommodate the British resident, the structures are opulent and suggestive of the lavish lifestyle of its occupants.The museum on campus shows some nice pictures."
"Amazing place. Full of colonial history and the ruins of the famous siege of 1857. Surrounded by lovely lawns, has a fairly good museum too. A must-visit for history buffs. Visit in winters or at least, in pleasant weather months to be able to explore the ruins and hear the tales in comfort."
Gives a peek into the Britishers way of living of 18th and 19th century Lucknow. Very well maintained  neat and well marked. Ruins throw a lot about times. Some are eerie...must visit.
"Has an aura typical of the british raj, connected to the first uprising of 1857 Mutiny as we had read in our history books.I am unsure whether they still continue to stage the sound & light show depicting the Mutiny of 1857. This used be an attraction some time ago.There also exists a 'Martiniere Post', were one Teacher and 52 students of The La Martiniere Boys' Lucknow held and fought for the Residency, this happened to be the forward most post which was attached the first.For the bravery shown by the Boys' the School was awarded with a Battle Honour, the only School in the world to have been awarded such a military distinction.This School too is a place worth visiting in Lucknow."
Well maintained by ASI. A must visit place in Lucknow. One can spend almost the whole day here. The walls still bears the bullet marks. Innumerable benches to take rest after walking for long. Don't miss it!
"Visiting this place is entering in the past. Our freedom fighters of 1857 eliminated the foriegn rule and ruined the british authourity success fully. The hindu and the muslims fought together and won. A must visit place, very well curated ."
Its history itself.symbol of resistance against oppression and struggle for freedom from British tyranny. Must visit if in lucknow. Witness of never seen before valour of tahjeebi lucknow which forced union jack to unfurl 24 hrs a day which never ever happened before.every brick has its own story.To enjoy it fully one should read 1857 1st war of independence.
excellent place to visit. has a museum also. Gives a feel of what happened in 1857. provide knowledge of historical characters
"The British Residency is a very interesting place to visit in Lucknow. Having a guide is well worth it, to hear the history and find out the details of the place."
British residency a very less known historic monument of great relevance is literally in hiding due to lack of awareness or may be promotion.this monumet in lucknow is  in the heart of the city a few km from hazratganj. can be easily located. it has  a minimal entry ticket and adequate parking .at least i could find one. .british residency is nothing but the ruins of the residency that endured the great sepoy mutiny of 1857 and ruins tell us a lot of the engineering and architecture and the elaborate layout.tips: no guides available. allow 2-3 hours time to enjoy the trip. carry water .and preserve the entry ticket.no more history since it is all available on google. info- the first song of a recent hindi movie  RAID has been shot at this place. enjoy the photos.don't miss visiting the place if one is in lucknow.
Spoilt by the weather. But it is a must visit place so much history really enjoyed walking around the ruins. Museum is a disappointment.
Take a guided tour to learn about India and the British influence and their history. The park like grounds are well kept with ample information signs located around the site. Allow about an hour in the cool peaceful grounds. Interesting to see how the English tried to control India.
Staying in Lucknow so decided to visit this place.  Its consists mainly of large buildings in ruins.  The museum located in the grounds is fairly interesting but not much to see. Strange to see 9 staff at a very small museum mmm! Buildings show evidence of cannon and rifle ball damage.
I was transported to the British Raj era. You get a feel of the sepoy mutiny. Strolling through the grounds you feel you are in a different world cut off from the din & bustle of the city.
"Must see on your list if history interests you. Very well maintained and preserved structures. Depicts a very important part of Indian history, please read up before you visit or arrange a guide. Requires already 1-2 hours, opens at 10 and closes by 5:15 pm."
"Situated on the banks of river Gomti, in center of Lucknow, the Residency, occupies an important position in history. In ruins today, it stands as silent witness to the brutal attack on the British during the 1857 uprising. It provides a glimpse to the living style of the British during those days. It is located close to other important landmarks of the city of that era."
Enjoyed my time here exploring the ruins. Site is well maintained and its very though provoking to see the battle scarred walls and to visit the cemetery where those who died in the 1857 siege were buried. Museum itself is very poor. Gardens are lush and green. A must for all visitors to Lucknow.
Essential visit for all you First War of Independence (AKA The Indian Mutiny of 1857) buffs. Relaxing quiet walk around the parkland setting amidst the ruins of the Residency buildings. You can still see the bullet holes and effects of canon fire on the walls of the buildings.
This place is mentioned in history books. it has a great importance with 1857 freedom fight.Marks bullets of that era is still live here. seems this place was left by british just yesterday.it consist of the ruins of old palace with chota imambara.
"To explore lucknow with some friends we decided to visit some old and historic structures of the city and we were amazed to find that our city contains such wonderful places.  Residency is very peaceful , beautiful place. You can feel the pulse of freedom moment. It's green , clean and calm. Need more attention from authorities to maintain the place"
"Had seen a glimpse of the British Residency in Lucknow in a Bengali film sometime ago. Hence, I wanted to see the Residency in person when I next visited the city. Am so glad that I did!Such splendid grounds that has been maintained immaculately. Have atleast a couple of hours in hand if you really wish to take your time and get a feel of the place. The historical facts are given alongside the ruins. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in the 1800s....."
"This is a complex of buildings which served as a political and residential base for the British officers and diplomats engaged with the princely state of Awadh. Of such kinds of complexes spread over British India, this one is famous for being under siege during the Uprising of 1857. The ruins bear the marks of battle and the graves of the departed.The lawns are impeccably well maintained and a few hours of peace and leisure spent here are well worth it. There is a small museum. Bags must be deposited at a locker facility before entering the museum. Chilled drinking water and good restroom facilities are available. However the authorities must consider appointing well trained guides to give information about the place."
A must see to learn about the British in Lucknow to see where and how they lived and what took place there. Allow a lot of time for this visit and go with a tour guide one who can tell you the history
Visited remains of buildings of British Residency. Good efforts to preserve the structures right from revolt of Indian soilders against Britishers in 1857. There are signs of bullets on the walls. Salute to those unknown Indian freedom fighter soilders. Worth visiting.
The Residency was the official residence of the Governor of Lucknow during the British Raj. Walk around the complex at leisure and take in the historic events the place witnessed first hand during the violent days of the first Indian uprising of 1857. The museum is especially interesting.  It has a collection of old paintings and lithographs - the only source of understanding the residency complex as it was  during the days of the British Raj
"The Residency was the centrepiece during the seige of Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny or 1st war of Indipendance. It has been maintained in ruins, and is a stark reminder of the Colonial past. The museum (closed Fridays) is worth a trip round. It is set in parkland, and makes a good walk. Don't usually do cemeteries, but the one here is worth a visit to see the mixture of deaths during the seige, both in action and by disease."
"Go back in the times of the Raj! Experience the violence of 1857 and feel the adrenaline rush in your spine.A must visit place for all, when in Lucknow."
