Went there with friends and it was awesome the water is so cold and nice. i had alot of fun and i would really go there again for sure.
"Had a great time at the Blue hole. It was a lot of fun jumping into the blue water and being surrounded by all the amazing nature. Last year I did Dunnâ€™s River Falls, I enjoyed the Blue  Hole a lot more. DRF was a lot colder & more of  a strenuous/dangerous hike. Trust me theâ€¦"
Great day out. My teenagers loved jumping into the water there. The guides were fabulous. Really helpful and friendly. They were happy to take photos and videos of us jumping and assisted us greatly in climbing up the rocks. Take cash as the guides expect tips. Water shoes are required or you can wear your own trainers. We bought water shoes from the blue hole at $15 per pair.   The jumps are around 2m 3m 5m and 8m and there is a rope swing too. Would definitely recommend. Thank you.
"This is by far my favorite excursion in Ocho Rios. It was cool refreshing water, the jumps were not too big which I prefer. The tour guides were very personal and friendly and it was not very busy. I never felt rushed as I have on other various excursions. The resort we stayed at offered Dunns River for free and wouldnâ€™t visit that again as itâ€™s vrry commercialized and over crowded. Weâ€™re going back in the middle of September and plan to visit the blue hole with some friends again as we really enjoyed it. We hired a local driver by the name of Duncan Carruthers and heâ€™s taken us on multiple excursions and gave us a really fair rate and exceptional service. Be sure to stop at Scotchies for some jerk for lunch afterwards."
My boyfriend and I went to the blue hole and the water was so blue and beautiful. Our tour guide was Nico. He was really cool and made us feel safe. We got a lot of nice pictures and videos of us jumping in each lagoon as well. The waterfall was a little scary at first but definitely a dope experience. Thank god we know how to swim haha
"Javier and Atika were great in our tour at the Blue Hole, we had so much fun! The waterfalls were great! Take your water shoes!"
"Beautiful scenery with really refreshing water.Our guide Alex was excellent, he helped us in and out of the water and took some great pictures with our camera. We hiked up to the top then worked our way down jumping into the pools. BE CAREFUL....IT IS SLIPPERY and a bit of a workout but sooo much fun. I even surprised myself by going on the rope swing. It would've been nice to spend a little more time swimming in the pools as the water was so nice.A great experience. Highly recommended."
I went in 2016 before this got popular and I climbed down the big waterfall.. Glad it appears to still be pretty much the same (except maybe safer). It was the best excursion ever! Still keep in contact with the locals there because they were such wonderfully amazing people!  Look forward to returning soon . Much love
"My son, friends and I went to the Blue Hole.  We had an amazing time. The guides were brilliant and lots of fun.  We spent a few hours there.  It is really worth going to.  Very exciting time we had.  Go enjoy. Me  "
"Had a great time at the Blue Hole. RYAN our guide was great fun and kept us laughing. There is a photographer at the Blue Hole who will take pictures and you get the option to view and buy them. I did buy them and had them on a cd disc, great memories.I would definitely recommend the Blue Hole for a couple of hours of fun.Thanks RYAN!!"
"Loved this spot with all the pools and rocks that we could jump off. Our guides were brilliant and so strong, pulling us up the rocks, taking great photos.  It was lovely and cool in the trees and the water was pleasantly warm. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Ricardo was an amazing host in the blue hole excursion trip! Had an amazing time with friends, and loved being in the presence of both the Ricardoâ€™s that guided us through the journey. They even went beyond on securing our personal items and making sure we had fun. Beautiful experience would highly recommend!"
Great experience!! Even better than Dunns river! Try get guide called Javier. - He really encouraged us and made sure we were safe on all the pools. And amazingly he got us to climb down the almost vertical waterfall which looked an impossible feat when we arrrived. The jumpsâ€¦
"This place was great, Private tour with Marvyn paradise tours and our driver Gregory was the best. He recommended Odean to us and he did not disappoint. Jumping, swimming, swinging, & climbing Odean was there the whole time directing us, keeping us safe, and overall making sure we had a great time at the blue hole. A+ experience."
"Visited with the family and had a great time diving into the clear waters (even though the initial plunge was COLD) which was refreshing.   The guides were very helpful, entertaining and best of all, great with the kids.   You have the option to skip jumping from any of the platforms as they do not pressure and/or rush you."
"Loved it here, was natural and a bit of an adventure. All the climbs, stairs made it so much better and interesting. The jumps and caves are really good and even though they are scarey just dont look down and go for it. ðŸ™ˆ. There are several entrances to the blue hole, I went to the first one which has 3 x Jumps.I went with Tranquility Tours (FB) who are based in Tower Isle 10mins from Ocho Rios. Marvin is very knowledgeable and professional,he was friendly and showed us some other local hidden gems and I would always use him for my tour/driving services now. His number is +18764515922"
"Blue hole was amazing! Between the sites and jumping into natural pools of water, we had a great time. Water shoes are a must!!! Expect to be soaked from the walking up the waterfalls and jumping into the water. We had Alex who was great making sure we had fun and was safe. Sandals never told us to bring money so we honestly didnâ€™t think about it until the end when he mentioned it. We felt horrible since we couldnâ€™t  but he made us feel even worse when he told my husband to come over to him and then said he should show appreciation to him by tipping him. VERY rude"
Blue Hole was a once in a lifetime experience.  It is gorgeous to look at.  Jumping off cliffs into beautiful blue water while coming down the waterfalls took courage but ended up being so much fun!
Ok itâ€™s higher than it looks in the pictures!  Great guides who a patient and fearless!  I did two jumps and my husband did them all. The swing was fun too!  I would defiantly go again and maybe not be so chicken.  Thanks Julian for your patience!
"Beautiful locale, but there were 2 ships in port that day, so it was really crowded. There were lines at all the different jumping-off points. Make sure you have water shoes, and expect to get some minor scrapes and scratches as you climb up and then out of the water. There were many young kids doing it too."
"Coming into blue hole, I was expecting 1 little swimming area with a small cliff to jump off of, little did I know there were several areas to swim, jump, climb & swing from. This place exceeded my expectations. Itâ€™s beautiful, the staff is beyond friendly & always there to guide you & help you be cautious. Definitely a go-to place while in Jamaica! Tyrone & Daniel made the adventure one I will never forget!"
Had a great experience cliff jumping and pictures to prove it! Our guide was great and allowed us to do multiple jumps and I felt safe the whole time.
Wow we loved this place. Itâ€™s totally unspoilt and new ish to tourists. We got there 8.30 am using the taxi man â€˜Eggieâ€™. Getting there early meant for most of the time we were on our own. Lots of jumping into cold pools of water. If your going to Ochos Rios itâ€™s a must.
"Visited with 12 year old daughter, we were on a organised trip through TUI, this really is a wonderful place it was great fun, the guides were excellent and helped you every step of the way , so much fun jumping in the water from cliff edges!!! My daughter throughly enjoyed this"
"Spent the morning with a group of friends traversing the falls and jumping into the water.  The area is scenic, the water invigorating.  The downside is the large number of people doing the same thing.  Everyone is having fun but it is a bit assembly line."
"We had a wonderful time on this shore excursion with Liberty if the Seas cruise ship. Climbing up waterfalls, jumping off cliffs up to 20 feet, rope swing. We are in our seventies and with families and couples and all found it exciting and fun. Then went tubbing down a river to lunch of delicious jerk chicken and rum punch. Great day. Highly recommend it. Our guides at Blue hole and guides Allen, Chantelle, and driver Jeff were wonderful."
"My bf and i recently did the blue hole and we had the best time!! Our guide ariel was super funny, knowledgeable, safe and friendly. We had a blast. Highly recommend! Way better then dunns river falls!! If u go to jamrock... Check them out!"
"We went when the water was very high and a very strong current but we had the best lifeguard/ guide ever!! Javier was so much fun, adventurous and constantly looking out for our safety so we could enjoy ourselves! The photos they took were great and we bought a cd on our way out! From a resort, ask for a Juta and if you get lucky, Junior will be your driver! He was great! Took us anywhere we wanted to go for the whole day! Even stopped at Daveâ€™s, a local place with amazing lobster!"
"Visited sept 2020, only maybe 6 other people here during our visit. Such a beautiful place and so much more to it than the main first pool you arrive to! A guide takes you up through all the other pools/waterfalls and there are loads of jumps to do, big and small! I managed to jump off a jump higher than I expected to, had an amazing fun time! The guide was great, helped us take loads of photos with our go pro. Probably my favourite excursion we did in jamaica! Highly recommend!"
Loved visiting the crystal clear waters and jumping off rocks into the amazing cool crisp water.  Our tour guide kinsbert with Chukka and king tours was a great help.
Absolutely the best excursion and guides!!! Shavonn and Ramone were our guides and they were so kind and genuine. The blue hole was the highlight of our trip. I totally understand why they say skip Dunnâ€™s river and do the Blue hole!! We did both and we should have skipped Dunnâ€™s river and the crowd! The Blue hole is a MUST if you are in Jamaica!! We had so much fun! Our group ranged in age from 14-50 years old and everyone had a blast. Thank you again Shavonn and Ramone for an amazing experience and some really great go pro footage! We also purchased the pictures and we are extremely happy with the quality(negotiate the price).
Our visit to Blue Hole was amazing.  Such a beautiful place with so many waterfalls and places to jump. Our tour guide Jason was awesome!!!!   Be sure to have water shoes with a good grip on bottom.
The guides were awesome and gave us a very fun experience!! Jumping off the cliffs was scary but very fun. My wife and I had a blast!!
Brilliant day out for family and couples some good jumps and beautiful photographs. Such a good day out. Make sure you go to island gully falls as this is right at the top and you dont have to walk to the pools. Also the guides are brilliant there and really helpfull. Taken to this attraction by richard brooks ocho rios tours. Was brilliant!
The waterfalls beautiful and the cliff jumping is not for the squeamish. Well worth the trip off the coast. We went with a local tour guide. Beware of the guy handing out Red Stripes in the middle. He will expect to be paid for the beer after you are done.
