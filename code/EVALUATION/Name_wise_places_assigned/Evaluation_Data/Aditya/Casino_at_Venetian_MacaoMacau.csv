"Played casino here with my GF and i must say that there are hundreds of machine and table to play to, sadly we dont have enough money to try every game.We won a bit but quitted afterwards as we are not really a gambler lol. Inside the casino is so spacious and luxurious, lots of free drinks and food too bad we cant take photo inside."
"very enjoyable ! entry age is 25 and they are quite particular about it. casino is bustling with good crowd. i tried the roullete, slot machines and a couple of card games. lost a few dollars and made a couple hundred bucks so it was all fun for me. nice experience. the shops and restaurants are all out of the casino, it only has smoking zones and game zones. bottled water, juices etc is given complimentary. a fun visit !"
The Venetian  has a massive  casino . Lots of tables n slots . Enjoy a few spins or  do some serious gambling you are sure to enjoy it  . Soft drinks are free not alcohol. No need for formal as frequented by tourist all day n night . Good  luck to all of you .
What a place. Went there not to gamble but to check out the gondola and lighting on roof. This place is amazing and breathtaking. You really felt like you were in Venice. If you go to Macau please donâ€™t leave this place out to see as when you see it you will never forget it
"Have stayed here several times. It is a very large resort with about 3000 guest rooms, its own shopping, casino, and many restaurants and bars. Also has a very large conference center.  It is billed s a all suites hotel with the smallest room being about 70 square meters. Rooms are large and very nice. Even with so many rooms things seem to move very well here.  The highlight for many is on the second level of the hotel. They have built a mini Venice complete with the canals and the boat rides for guests. Because it covers several levels you really do not even know you are inside a very large building.  Complete with walk ways cafes, and shops. You could spend several days and never leave the hotel. Worth a trip to this wonderful resort."
"Had to check out the Casino at Venetian Macao and I have to say - because I have been to the Venetian in Las Vegas Nevada - it's very similar with the gondola rides, the various in door food and shopping - but what was different was how they really ONLY let adults (18 and over) into the casino so they really do monitor.  Was great to visit - but again because i've been to the Venetian in Las Vegas I guess I wasn't overly 'wowed"""
"Went on 21/6 Thur with my husband. Like it that it was spacious, not too crowded and non smoking. However, the membership and points are not very attrative. Points with limited uses. Much prefer Galaxy casino's membership card which gets you discount at most of the retail shops."
"Amazing place to meet. Didnâ€™t went there to play, only to see the place and we love it. It is huge and very well decorated."
Once in a lifetime experience to visit this casino. Very nice ambience and lotâ€™s of attraction. Play multiple games here. You feel you are in heaven.
"I could not leave Macau without visiting at least one of the casinos, since this city is the most successful gambling one in the world, with many incredible casinos. 5 of Macauâ€™s casinos have made the list of the 10 biggest casinos in the world. So I decided to visit the second-largest casino in the world with 10,500,00 square feet of overall space! It has 800 gambling tables, 4 themed gambling areas, and over 6,000 slot machines. Seeing this miraculous Venetian inspired building, right across from the City of Dreams casino was something to remember.  But what was really exciting for me is playing on the slot machines. There is no casino in my hometown so I play online free slots that require no download and no registration. My favorite slot is 88 Fortunes by Bally and I always play online at Freeslotshub (you can see in my bio the link). I like spinning the reels and going after the 4 progressive Jackpots in the game. I didnâ€™t get to win a big Jackpot this time, but I had a lot of fun even though there was a lurker around. Touching the slot machine gives you a different feeling, but I must admit it made me a bit nervous playing at a real land casino and I missed the bonuses of an online one. It was an experience to remember and I won some money back in the end."
With more than 12 types of games and 8 types of betting activities its one of the biggest casinos in asia. Enjoyed a lot with people winning and losing at the same table but one should always play as per their pocket in order to have good experience.
"We were there not to gamble but just to have a look at the largest casino in the world. Huge busy and very Chinese with Western faces at all, not a problem just a fact. Great place to visit and marvel at. Enjoy"
Too many tourist and noisy casino. Had a wide range of tables with low wager bet but not advisable for discrete players.
Try Your Luck and Enjoy lots of Variety of card games as well as slot machine and rollatee. Biggest Table and Good Staff
"The casino was busy beyond belief!!  It is just a cool place to visit, great restaurants and shopping is so much better here than Las Vegas!  It is vegas on steroids !!!  Enjoyed the visit and a must to see!!"
We joined a tour group and was taken to the venetian. The hotel was very busy and many tourist. Appears to be a drop-off point. The gondola ride looks interesting although it is a short ride. Personally i dont find it a value for money but have seen people queuing for this.The interior decor is amasing. Lots of shops around if you are not a gambler. Good for a visit.
was a huge casino. staff dont speak english at all. when we asked them to explain the game they couldnt. so if u r new then u have to use your brains to understand n play the game.
"You will be spoilt for choices when it comes to casino in Macau. The casino is Venetian is considered one of the biggest among the many. Whichever time you go, it is always crowded. All casinos provide free beverages n bottle water for the guests. Restaurants are easily available inside too. Is an eye opening experience if you have never been to a casino."
This hotel is over rated in terms of class and service. I was rudely refused entry in to the casinos over the pretext I didnâ€™t look 21. I am 40 years old (nowhere close to 21) and had valid electronic passport ID which Mr.Roshan (security to casinos) refused to accept. These guys are jokers and need training on service and hospitality as they seem to be on some sort of power trip. In fact he even went to the extent of informing other security personnel to not let me in which was uncalled for and insulting. My husband and I chose to visit the other casinos where we had a great experience.  MGM is a far better place to stay and play. Avoid the Venetian at any cost. I am glad I did.
Day trip to Macau via ferry. Took a cab to the Venetian. This place is huge! Stopped and deposited 100 hkd at the casino! They have a Venetian style boat and waterway throughout the mall. You can rent a boat ride through the canals. Lots of shopping to be had. And extremely busy. Lots to look at too. Very well done.
"Normally i would give the Venetian casino a higher rating due to its being the biggest casino in Macau. However, over the years, the quality seems to have deteriorated and cost-saving measures are now evident. Bottled water used to be readily available and on display for all guests to enjoy. But now only the guests playing at the tables have water at their disposal. Other guests have to scramble to find bottled water. On one such occasion, I approached one table (no playing guests but just the dealer and a ""supervisor"" present) to attempt to get a bottle of water. I was not aware that i had entered a ""no-entry"" zone between 2 tables. Before I knew it, the ""supervisor"" (not sure of her position but she was standing between 2 tables, as if ""supervising"" the dealers) shouted at me rudely and loudly that I am not allowed to enter the area. Realizing my mistake and  embarrassed by her reaction, I explained that I merely wanted to get a bottle of water from the table. Instead of just handing me the bottle of water, she again spoke rudely and said that i should move over to the other side to get the water.I admit that I had made a mistake but her attitude and the way she spoke to me, a guest, is extremely rude and impolite. She could have explained the situation politely to me and I would have understood but she had to shout loudly and harshly.I recommend that further training should be given by Venetian to its staff inside the casino to make them understand the concept of customer service and delight. Water should also be made readily available to all guests, not hidden and given only to favored guests. What should have been an enjoyable visit was ruined by one rude staff."
Look like Las Vegas but more bigger then that. This Venetian building make my dream to Las Vegas come true even it not in Las Vegas. But the feel i get it's like Las Vegas.
Good place if you have quite a lot of money to spend. Played lot on slot machines. Tables were expensive and minimum budget was $25 and only 2 tables were available in that budget. Rest of them were $100 and more. Try your luck at casino
"Visited it for 2 hours.. Filled with hyenas who hog machines doing nothing but kept asking if you every few minutes whether can you earn points for them, whether you need to change HKD, need girls, need $$$...Irritating to the max! ðŸ˜©"
"Having stayed at the Venetian Las Vegas I was keen to  see the bigger version in Macau - it did not disappoint. Great selection of pokies although very limited black jack (this was the same everywhere) tables with reasonable min stakes. the big difference between Vegas and Macau is the types of pokies and tables - obviously the majority are Chinese which can be a little frustrating for westerners  who can struggle to find games they can understand  and play - having said that the bigger casinos (Studio City, Venetian, Parisian, Grand Lisboa, City of Dreams) do deliver just remeber what the currency conversion is when you are playing!"
We wanted to visit one casino whilst in Macau and decided on the Venetian. It truly has the wow factor. Having been to Venice a couple of years ago it was incredible to see the recreations of the city both outside and inside the building. Inside the mall the ceiling is painted as the Venice sky and there are actually gondolas with gondoliers on the recreated canals. The casino portion itself seems to take itself very seriously and looks to appeal to serious gamblers. There are a few eateries and restaurants but no drinking in the actual casino portion. A free shuttle bus is available back to the ferry terminal but allow plenty of time as it seemed to take forever.
"Staying a long weekend for a special occasion. Room is disappointing for the price, poor setting and cheap accessories, smell cigarette although we specified non-smoking, toilet barely cleaned. Not a 5 stars at this stage. Ridiculous and very annoying security staff in the lobbies. If you want to avoid the casino floor, you need to walk twice the distance! Nobody really cares of anything here, not recommended at all."
"Caught a ferry from Kowloon to visit Macau which is comfortable and reasonably priced. On arriving you just grab a complimentary bus to the casino of choice in city. The Venetian is a pretty good attempt to create a bit of Italy in Macau.  A recreated Campanile from St Marks Square, copy of the Bridge of Sighs, canals and gondolas and recreated scenes inside are kitch, but far cheaper than visiting Venice!  Taken for what it is, itâ€™s good fun. Casino itself is what youâ€™d expect of any casino, lots of machines and tables, over the top decor and plenty of people."
"Great place to visit when you first come to Macau. Huge casino will definitely blow you away. But the casino has its age, the machines are kind of old. Not good for true gamblers. Donâ€™t forget to apply for Sands Member card to play and earn points to redeem all kinds of free gifts."
"Was afraid if they let me in in shorts and t-shirt but there was no problem at all. So many people going in and out, but  you can easily find a place to play many games. I was playing roulette (dont know all the superrules) but staff told me what to do and what to not. Almost everything is covered by gold, nice Italian architecture. If you were not playing here, you were not in Macau!"
"Went there to see the indoor sky & was very impressed with how the lighting & artwork made it look so real. Like most casinos I suppose, it was very very crowded on a Saturday afternoon."
"One of those places  that people go to just to say they have been. Very busy, very artificial and not really my cup of tea. Lots of people around. If I was staying here as a guest I think I would become very frustrated. Didnâ€™t do the gondola ride, but it costs $180HKD ($33 AUD) per person for a short ride. While walking around I did enjoy listening one of the guides singing to his passengers. Been there once wouldnâ€™t go back. Free shuttle bus from west wing back to the Macau terminal is a big plus"
"Most fancy shopping center. So Venice looking like, but so fake. Reminded more some Disney Studios than Venice.The disadvantages: - looked for Italian ice-cream, but could not find;- bought Tiger beer and discovered that even the cup is a fake (see the pic)."
"Thank you to Venetian casino!! My wife and I had a lucky and wonderful night with you, will come back win you again soon lol"
It so huge casino lot of  shop and resturant for lunch and dinner . Have a free shuttle bus from airport are provide.
