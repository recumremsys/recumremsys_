The beach is very clean and safe. Beautiful white sand. Enjoyed the beach walk and picture taking. A nice beach for relaxation .
Best views and good climate! Go for surfing or just swimming. Water is clear and beach is really clean
"Having all weathers during our visit we still enjoyed our walks along the beach. Watching the surfers and swimmers,  the changes in colour of the sea and sky remarkable. Just a lovely warm relaxing place to visit and unwind"
"The white clean sand is so unique with bustling waves inviting the surfers to catch them. Encouraging to see the machine going through early morning to sweep through filter any rubbish left behind the day before, leaving just that fine clean sand for beach goers to enjoy.It was 22Â°C in the middle of Winter season making it an unbelievable magic holiday.My family and I thoroughly enjoyed the â›± beauty the beach had to offer."
"Beautiful clean beach, good amenities close by. Surf lifesaver on site . Learn to surf & lots more to do."
"Easy access, close to all amenities lots of shops close by. Great day out! Bring your hats and sunscreen because the sun is hot!"
"Nice and clean beach, blue water and a beautiful coastline. Very nice to visit on a warm clear day. Loved it."
"Surfers Paradise Beach is squeaky white sand and stunning, a great way to start the day with a walk along the shoreline from Surfers Paradise to Broadbeach for breakfast! There are patrolled swimming  areas all along the beach for safe swimming. Head north to Main Beach and again you are spoiled for choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Spend a weekend, a week or relocate to the best place to live in Australia."
"Itâ€™s the best romantic beach for the lovers walking along the beach hand in hand, better not in overhead sun. Highly recommend to go there near sunset, especially in summer time, not too hot. Take off the shoes or slippers, feel the smooth sand with your bare foot. The feeling is wonderful. And feel energetic too when seeing the surfers surf on the waves."
Beautiful  broad beach with fine sand. Located right at the end of Cavill Avenue so plenty of eateries nearby. The beach itself  has lifeguards and good shower facilities.
The beach was beautiful. Patrolled by lifesavers and not too busy. Water temp was great. Had a couple of days the beach was closed due to a cyclone off shore but otherwise would totally recommend.
The longest beach every. Walk and walk and walk on firm sand at low tide or walk along the path above. We saw a bit of rain and a very high tide and it was fabulous every time. The beach was closed one day due to the high swell but didnâ€™t stop walks. Very clean.
"White sandy beaches as far as the eye can see. Patrolled areas. Close to shopping district, food outlets and and transportation links."
"Enjoy in the water day time and a beautiful walk in the night. I believe Surfers Paradise beach is a must visit place in Australia either you are a solo traveller, a couple or with family. There is Night market along the beachside on Wednesday, Friday, Sunday which is fun.I recently visited Surfers with my partner, we spent our day at the beach swimming, having fun roaming around, visited the night market and had a relaxing massage at our favorite place Virtue Massage, dinner, and Shisha at boulevard shisha lounge. Had a Great day with lots of fun!!!"
Nice beach right in front of the heart of town does drop off a bit. Beautiful white sand kept very clean no litter. Lots of bench seats along waterfront and plenty of public toilets. Life savers and plenty of swim and surf schools running. Loved the Lest we Forget Monument
"This place is full of life, bustling with surfers and beach goers. We loved this place. There are PLENTY of place to eat as well as there are flea markets on the coastline by the street. Had the best fish and chips. Highly recommend."
"This city marries International standard Theme Parks with nature at its best. The Surfers Paradise strp couples long beaches of golden sands with miles of safe surfing beaches that are always fully patrolled. Then a mere 400 meters inland there are waterway edged with immaculate private residences. Daily cruises along the canals is  not to be missed. Plenty of accommodation offering a wide range of pricing. The Australian food is wonderful - especially the seafood which is extremely fresh and with a  wide variety. Try Ashmore Steak and Seafood, you won't be sorry."
"The GCCC have done a great job re-vamping Surfers Paradise Beach, lots of walking tracks. Highly recommend. Avoid on the weekend if possible as it will be exceptionally busy."
"Surfers Paradise Beach took my breath away. With the city skyline in the background, clean sand and clear waters this was an absolute must stop. Relaxing here after brunch nearby we soaked in the sun. The beach stretches for quite a ways so it is a great walk as well. Highly Recommend."
"If you like your beach filled with tourists and towering sky scrapers this beach is okay.  I advise to head south to Burleigh, Currumbin, Kirra or Coolangatta to experience the beautiful beaches and iconic surf breaks. Youâ€™ll feel much more connected to nature anywhere other than Surfers Paradise.  Ask any GC local where the best beaches are."
"Is beach is fabulous it goes for kilometres and it is subdivided in sections with lifeguards every 100 metres or so. The temperature is 21 in the water in mid nov. the sand is so fine gorgeous, long walks are a must! Make sure you swim between the flags, take an umbrella and sunscreen. Enjoy this little paradise for free! Australia you little beauty!!"
"Reminds me of Mount Manganui in New Zealand . Very lovely views, incredible sunrises and very safe feeling. Clean and with life guards. Haven't swum in it yet though."
"Lovely golden sand.   It must have been quite magnificent before being spoiled with all the highrise buildings casting afternoon shadows on the beach.  Was surprised at the bank of sand which made a difficult slope for older people to get up, so had to walk further along the beach to avoid it."
The complete holiday experience surrounded by beachside dining shopping bar and club. Don't miss out ðŸŒžðŸŒŠ
"Great beach for walking at day and night, check night market day you can find something good made by local; maybe too many people visiting there is always an idiot make place dirty on chairs and toilets.. Suggest put more lighting and children activities in beach walk like south port playground very successful for family members with young kids."
"First time visit to Surfers Paradise and this is one cool place. A bit of weather warning when we arrived but the feeling is amazing, clean beach, all family friendly. Next to so many shops and eatery. Went there at night time too and enjoyed every bit of it with the family. Highly recommend if you in Gold Coast. At least spend a day or two in Surfers Paradise."
"Miles of golden sands that are kept in beautifully clean condition. Great shower and cold water facilities. So much space, great waves and just about all the local amenities you could want (and a few you might not if youâ€™re not into touristy stuff or the party scene at night) This was a great place to stay. Super friendly locals, safe environment for kids and the beach was better than any that we visited doing highway one in California. Loved it."
"Highly attracted place for the tourists and each season more and more people select Surfers as their destination.Beach is very neat and tidy. Although we are not allowed to consume liquor on the beach, it still attracts lot of crowd. Pick Up you juices and head to the beach.Things to carryâœ…Towelâœ…Sunglassesâœ…Hats or Capsâœ…Sunscreen"
Stayed nearby for a week and went to the beach most days. Always clean and well managed by lifeguards.
"The beach felt generally clean and safe. There are lifeguards during the mornings and afternoons and in the evenings, there are just so many people hanging around and relaxing, you wonâ€™t be alone. Loved that there are night markets 3 times a week, some of the things they are selling are actually quite good. The kids loved the beach, both morning and night. Just be wary that the waves can come in really quick during the evenings, so those with little kids shouldnâ€™t leave them on their own at all."
"After visiting Sky Point, we just HAD to go on the beach. Being Brits Aboard, it was great to see the Lifeguards stationed on the beach entrance, with their gazebo, chairs,lookout tower and buggy at the ready!It was really Bostin to just lie back and think, ""yes I am lying here on Surfers Paradise Beach! We felt really safe and secure knowing we were being looked after!"
"Want to spend a relaxing day at a beautiful beach? This is the one. Soft, warm, white sand. Cool crystal clear water. Walk along the breaking waves and hop across the boardwalk for good eats. Lots of choices!"
The beach still looks great after my revisit after more than 10yrs! Remember that they don't allow pets to be on the beach when we were back then but it seems that they have open up this rule for the pet lovers to share the beach with their furries.
"An absolute must do for foreigners. Golden white sand for miles, steady waves. Be aware of rips and only swim between the flags as conditions in the water can be dangerous. Patrolled, even in winter!"
"Looking forward to VIVA Surfers Paradise 2020 - get in early and book accommodation. This was a great festival, well organised, with a wonderful array of vintage cars, an Elvis Presley event hosted by Dean Vegas, lots of events to suit all tastes, spanning a week or so. Browse the regular, interesting street markets, free music and entertainment. We even saw a white whale passing on its way north. Imagine that! Fabulous, well-run event with a backdrop of pristine white beaches and ocean breezes. Just magic."
