Visit the main entrance and the four gates .. nothing else there for normal tikit. You have to buy 3000rs or more of tikit to visit the blue room etc
If you have good time then take audio guide or go for normal guide.  Beaware of fake guides. Need atleast 2hours for photos and listen audio recording (40min) 
Good place to visit though the entre free is not worth. The Museum's give a feeling of the age and things are well preserved. Take a guide for better history. One time visit is good.
I used audio guide to see the two plazas and various museum exhibits. Was ok but not spectacular. Did not pay high price to enter palace. 
"It's one of the places you are ""supposed"" to visit when in Jaipur but at 700Rs for the cheapest (foreigner) ticket I didn't feel I got my money's worth. There are some pretty parts (the lotus door is gorgeous for example) but there wasn't much to make it worth the price. The guards are all desperate for you to have your photo taken with them in the hope of a tip. I can't imagine paying the exorbitant price to see the extra rooms - save yourself a small fortune and look at the pictures online. Plenty of tourist tat shops in here too in case you didn't get enough outside the palace. Keep hold of your ticket as it can be used at a few other sights on the same day or the following day."
We did the museum which is well worth a visit as there was so much to see. There is an option to visit the Palace rooms but this was very expensive and from what I read not really worth it. Give yourself a few hours if you want to see it all.
"This is a beautiful palace area with much to see.  Especially interesting we’re the armory and textile/clothing exhibits inside. Unfortunately, no photos are allowed as there are very interesting exhibits and some of the armory exhibits are unlike any we’ve seen anywhere else in the world.  Look for the two flags flying at the palace and you’ll know that the king is inside.  As with most sites we saw in this area, a guide is essential to getting the subtle details as you tour the palace."
This is another must for Jaipur. Easy to get around and extremely interesting. Some awesome things to see. Take an hour or so. 
This is currently residence of jaipur maharaja also. Don't miss the arms gallery that is lovely. Need at least 1 house to cover this place.
I only njoyed this place in Jaipur.  Worth visiting..  You should have good amount of time while visiting this..  Beautiful place.  Don't miss this place in your jaipur visit.
We visited early afternoon after the amber fort in the morning. In particular we recommend the textiles section of the museum as there are a few fabulous items from the royal wardrobe. Including those of a 7ft high 4ft wide ruler and another's wedding dress! Some of them…
"So this place is one of the most important places to visit in Jaipur. You can go to the palace grounds where everyone visit including museum or you can also pay more or visit the private section, where Jaipur’s royal family are living now, but you won’t see them as they’re on separate floors. And that’s where you’ll find beautifully painted or decorated rooms for great Instagram worthy shots.There’s a high tea cafe and I recommend the chai masala there, it’s one of the best I had in India.You can combine visiting the City Palace with Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar as they’re all within walking proximity from one another. Ask about combined ticket entrance to save more.I would recommend, if you’ve got one day of touring the city to start with Patrika Gate, it’s not historical, but it’s a great place to take photos early in the morning be there at 9am or before that before it gets crowded, then head to Amer/Amber Fort and pass by the Stepwell first which is close. After you’re done have a break then head to City Palace, Hawa Mahal, and Jantar Mantar."
Nice Palace for a visit. Not spectacular but worth a short visit. See some areas and Royal costumes.
"How is this 700INR? Compared to other attractions in Jaipur and India this is very expensive. The Palace itself is pleasant, but my visit to the armoury was ruined by a guy following me around asking for money because he pointed at the ceiling and some weapons.When I told him I had no money on me he said he accepted British money."
Very expensive at USD 50 and poor value. You see only a few photos of royal families. Rest of City Palace is fine.
Some great buildings and continuing the pink theme this Palace has thankfully been retained and is a pleasant way to spend an hour or two exploring. Again no cameras in the main meeting hall but very interesting. Beware taking photos of the guards as they demand rupees…
"Looks promising but only ok inside. 700inr to get in, not really worth it. The ticket allows access to some other places but we’d already been through the 1000 composite ticket, which was a better value deal access to maybe 8 places."
"Its a grand but an expensive affair to visit this attraction. Located at just a walking distance from Jantar mantar, this place has an entry fee of 200 Rs for Indian tourists. Guide charges are heavy at around 400 Rs. However, a guide is necessary to visit this place which stretches to approx 2 kms of area and houses many small museums with lots of information to store in mind."
Went here with a guide for a couple of hours.we went early morni g so it wasn't really busy. Very interesting and pretty place to visit.
"Visiting and enjoying the City Palace Museum is a must. It is a palace complex with courtyards, pavilions & gardens. The palace was built between 1729 and 1732 by the ruler of Amber Sawai Jai Singh II. It became museum in 1959. There are stunning gates with ornate designs and peacock art. SEE photos"
"Certainly not the most impressive palace you can visit in Rajasthan, but well worth the visit anyway. The portraits of the kings over a step back in time, the large silver containers are the biggest you’ve seen and there are some nice picture opportunities. Beware of the guards…"
One looking to see the very old belongings of the earlier people then a must go place. learned a lot of things about the indian culture.
"- This is the palace of present King.- Better to get a guide for a memorable experiance. 300/- is the standard rate for a family (4-5 persons). Don't know if it is more for a group.- Get a ticket from the ticket counter, if I remeber it correcty it was 200/- per person.- It is devided into 6 parts, as per description from the guide.- It has a levish food court as well with altra high prices.- There is a separate fees for visiting the palace area of current king. It's around 3000/- person.- There is a nice collection of local culture galarry inside the palace. - It was a good one."
This palace is big and desrves your time. Do not rush; it is beautiful. There is also a small museum of textiles- costumes from the Maharajah's era - which is very interesting to see. You certainly come away with a good impression of how the Mhaharajah of Rajasthan lived. Well…
The City Palace is worth a visit although it is not as well maintained as some other Palaces in Rajasthan.  Don’t bother with the audio tour as it is incredibly boring and we would not recommend it.  The Palace has such a rich history and you are better off with a live guide.
We spent around 2 hours. A historical gem showing past of Rajasthan Rulers. Enjoyed our visit. You can also purchase handicrafts and art effects but the same are a bit costly. entry fee of Rs.200/- per person is on the higher side
"Went there twice. Entrance was INR700/pax exclude private royal quarters. Do visit perhaps towards late afternoon to avoid group tourists as you can take pictures. A living palace with the current Maharajah royal family still reside here. Royal restaurant, an AirBnB Royal Suite…"
"Visited the City Palace of Jaipur on 28th October 2019. Though, I am not big into Palaces and Castles, I was very happy that I made the time and took the effort. Starting from the person in the ticket booking counter to the guide Himmat Singh, the entire experience for, us as a family, a life time experience. Himmat Singh, our guide was well informed of every aspect of the palace as well as the Royal Heritage. He was patient and ensured we enjoyed the tour. Moreover, his photography skills were excellent and he knew where to spend time taking good pictures as my wife is an avid photographer. To see and learn about the Royal Heritage of Jaipur made us fee proud to be an Indian, a country so rich in heritage. Kudos to the Royal family for making it easy for people to experience this.To Himmat Singh - a huge thanks.To the Pink City of Jaipur - Long may your heritage shine to glory .We will be back.Ravi"
"Amazing what you can see, experience and learn here. Don't forget the wapen's room and have info on some of the pieces. Take your time to stroll around!"
"The management tries to charge a lot for entry. Buy the cheapest ticket and take a stroll. The silver vessels are interesting, nothing too special here. Spend your time shopping or eating!"
Visited here and really liked it. Plenty to see. Lovely architecture. Plenty of history attached to the place. It has the two biggest solid silver bowls on earth. This place is well worth a visit.
"Visited ""The Golden Triangle"" recently. The City Palace of Jaipur was well worth a visit,  stunning building so well crafted all those years ago. After every step was another view and wow factor. Well worth a visit but would suggest go with a guide or read up all about it before…"
Showcasing the history of the Jaipur maharajas. Entry fee varying from 200 to visit the museum to 3000 for a tour of the private rooms inside the palace. Advisable to take a guide along or at least an audio guide to know the full history and stories behind the place. The only negative is the that the best bits are not allowed to be photographed.
A huge palace in the Jaipur city. A guide gives you a good amount of detail on the palace. But you can still visit the palace without a guide. A small puppet shop is located near the exit of the palace. They perform on request. Try it if you are interested.
"Felt the 700inr entrance was quite expensive for the level of access it provided, although there were some interesting things to see, like the largest silver objects in the world for instance. However, this one definitely had the 'tourist trap' feel to me though."
