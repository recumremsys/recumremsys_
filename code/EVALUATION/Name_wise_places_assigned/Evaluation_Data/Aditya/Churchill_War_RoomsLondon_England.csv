"We discovered this place, funnily enough, for a Valentine's day special. They had organized a whole event night, with dancers and dance classes from the 30's-40's, and an underground bar, everyone was supposed to dress up in the WWII style, it was really awesome. The exhibit itself is really fascinating, if you're a history buff, this place is for you. It has been preserved as it was during the war, and it's a great visual learning tool for kids too. It really makes history come alive. Loved it!"
"Had a private view as part of an organised party, and some of us had done quite a lot of preparation. But I certainly wasn't prepared for the detail, nor the atmosphere.  If you're interested in WW2, or the practicalities of command, I recommend it."
Loved this ...very interesting and informative . We got a 2 for 1 ticket deal as we proved we had travelled by rail to London ..so it was an absolute bargain. Would definitely recommend
"One of the coolest things I did while in London. This is a first trip must do. A few tips for visiting: 1-Buy your ticket online in advance. The lines for buying in person is a very long wait in comparison. You'll have a particular time slot on your ticket--don't get there earlier than it says because they won't let you in line until then. 2-The lines to get in are outdoors so dress warm if it's cold out. Once we were let in we were led through to get our free audio guides and begin the self guided tour. The war rooms were found in the 1980's, almost exactly as they were left after the war. I felt transported through history and had chills many times while visiting these historic rooms. It is pretty amazing to see everything in close to it's original state. In addition to the rooms there is a very informative Churchill museum to visit in the space. I learned so much while here and felt like it was one of the most memorable stops I visited during my first trip to London. Don't miss it if you love history."
"Being a Churchill fan and a bit of historian, I always wanted to go the war rooms. And they did not disappoint, everything is preserved so beautifully that it feels like transported back in time! I can't imagine living in that era and what decisions made in those rooms that we still need to be thankful for!"
"We visited today as family with teenagers and throughly enjoyed the visit. Great audio tour and we all learnt loads and could have stayed longer as so much to see. The visit was really enhanced by a volunteer helper Lee Harris who was very knowledgable and helpful, telling us lots of interesting stories and showing us how to get the most out of the different exhibits. Thank you so much. Highly recommend a visit to this very interesting museum. Very COVID friendly too."
First time we visited and a must for WWII history buffs. We learned so much and the way everything was presented was excellent. Plan on spending 2-3 hours. Buy timed tickets before on line to avoid crowds. Small cafeteria with good sandwiches.
"Seeing is believing and touring the War Rooms left us feeling  incredulous and grateful to those that spent years working in this underground world.  The rooms are well presented and the audio tour perfect.  A great, well deserved honor to Churchill and his staff.  Highly recommend!"
Another historical gem. See what went on underground!  I enjoyed the secrecy and the history of this visit.
I love this place.  Went about 5 years ago and again this year.  To feel what it must have been like during those dark days when Churchill was under pressure to agree peace terms and refused.  I really piece of living history
"Missed this on my last trip (line up) but went this time. This is a fantastic museum, great history, great information and well worth it."
If you like history you will love this. The exhibits were intresting and I think the audio guide is a must. It is real not a mock up. If I was going to be critical I would say there was a lot of reading in the Churchill exhibition. Saying which I didn't know he did so much in his early years in politics. The place itself was very organised and clean. I would definitely recommend this great attraction.
So glad my coworker recommended this place.  It is a great museum that has informative audio and very cool visuals throughout!   A description of the museum does not tell the whole story.  Seeing it in person I was totally in Awe as to what they did to strategize and run the war.
I was here on last Sunday. They did a wonderful job of making you feel that you are there when Churchill was doing all his planning. The exhibits were great and walking through all the rooms and hearing all the information was truly magnificent. A lot of background on Churchill that I didn’t really know about. Do not miss this when you are in London
"Wanted to come here for a while after watching the film. Did not disappoint at all! We learnt so much and the atmosphere felt very real when walking around.  Using the hand held guides was very easy and learnt a lot. Took a good hour and a half to go around, but would of taken much longer if we looked into everything properly.  Very much worth a look."
This is a a great museum.  So much interesting information that I didn't know much about.  Prepare for a long visit though
Spent a couple of hours at the War Museum and it was very informative and interesting. Due to  Coronavirus I understand the museum was unusually quiet but it meant we could walk through each section at our leisure.The restoration of the rooms and their contents were the most inspiring part of the tour and great to add more of a background to the recent film.
"Visited the Churchill war rooms a couple of days ago and wasn’t sure what to expect but it was rated highly on trip advisor so gave it a go. Thoroughly enjoyed it and found it informative and enlightening. We have previously been to Alcatraz in San Francisco, wall museum at check point Charlie in Berlin and the War remnants museum in Vietnam but we have never done our own history. Would recommend a visit and it is probably one of the best ways to spend a couple of hours on a wet day in London"
"This is a nice museum that shows a different side of  WWII.  The war rooms were interesting but the best part was the newer Churchill Museum that chronicles Churchill's life both before and after the way.  Go early in the day though since it does get crowded making it difficult to view the exhibits--especially in the war rooms.  Also, despite having pre-bought our tickets to be able to skip the line we were still funneled into the regular admission line to have our tickets scanned."
"Booked tickets on line to avoid lining up and waiting. Busy with school groups but it is a museum and pleased to see them learning about the past. Take your time through there is a lot to read, see and hear. The audio guide is a must and enhances the information and your visit. We stopped for afternoon tea in cafe, food was great but just sitting there was an experience imaging what the folks experienced during the war."
"Don't miss this one. The underground bunker—offices and sleeping quarters—where Churchill and his staff worked and often lived during the Blitz is preserved as a museum, with an adjoining museum about Churchill himself. This is a marvelous and moving place. In the ""map room,"" you can see the map-covered walls with formations of pins and yarn showing the various fronts, just as they were when the room was last used. Also various meeting rooms and sleeping quarters, including Churchill's room, with a narrow bed and the desk from which he delivered his nightly BBC radio addresses to his beleaguered and valiant fellow-Londoners. Memorable and wonderful."
T The quarters were rudimentary even for the generals and the Prime Minister.  Don't miss it.  Buy tickets online to avoid the lines.
Excellent! We spent 4 hours learning about Churchill. It was very well presented and so informative. We were lucky that it wasn't too busy so were able to get to everything easily to read and listen. Have nothing negative to report and would strongly recommend it. It would be difficult to keep young children entertained but think teenagers and above should visit to understand how much we have to thank Churchill for.
"As a WW2 history fan, this tour was a must. Walking through the war rooms was like stepping back in time. They did a great job restoring the rooms and making the tour informative with the audio guide.  The Churchill museum was amazing. You could spend 3-4 hours there if you wanted to see and read everything. Very well done. I highly recommend this place."
The CWR do a nice job on telling the story of Churchill and his cabinet and what London was going through during the Blitz. Make sure you have a fair amount of time to explore because the Churchill exhibit at the end took me longer to go through than I anticipated. So much to learn! Worth a visit and a repeat visit.
"Was on our 'to-do' list on a visit to London - excellent all round. Talk-along was well paced and rooms fascinating - my Grandad was an ARP warden in the war, and to see the consolidated London bombing reports that Churchill read on a daily basis brought it to life. Churchill exhibition was interesting, but a little dis-organised, and the free-form presentation did not work for me. But overall - definitely worth a visit for a one-off piece of history."
"Being a fan of the royal family and ""The Crown,"" it was interesting to learn more about Winston Churchill and the War Rooms. Who would have thought that below ground, was this busy ""office."" The layout of the area very much represented what the actual area looked like back in the day. We were also offered free audio but due to the coronavirus, we declined. Even without all the additional information, we still learned plenty. I highly recommend this spot to someone who is interested in history, Churchill , war, or even if you aren't."
Visited Churchill’s War Rooms early in the day when the crowds were still in bed. Totally enjoyed learning more about the history of WW2 and the part Churchill played in this war and his history too.  Original rooms gave an excellent impression of how their lives were lived in this period..thoroughly enjoyable.
"Don’t be worried about social distancing in the corridors, guys, they’ve got it organised brilliantly with an efficient one way system, plentiful hand sanitiser stations and the option to buy a mask if you don’t have one to hand. Staff were friendly and made me feel welcome (especially the gent with a majestic beard who sold me a beautiful tote bag) and the exhibits are as captivating as ever. Only downside was they didn’t have the audio tour in American."
"I did a self guided tour. Had no idea what to expect but I really enjoyed it and learned a lot! There's so much history down there and you get a real feel for what it must have felt like to be in London during the war.The museum is really well curated and has a lot of very cool items, including the Number 10 door from when Churchill was PM.I got my tickets in advance. Your phone won't work once you're inside the doors so make any calls/texts on the outside before you begin (they work a bit by the restroom off their wifi I believe though)."
"The Churchill War Rooms were amazing.  Viewing many of the artifacts, especially the map room, drew me back in time to World War II.  There were so many exhibits in the war rooms and the Churchill museum that it seemed impossible to take it all in in one visit.  The multi-media displays of Churchill's life added to the interest of the war rooms.  Visiting in February, it was not too crowded and I was able to take as much time as I needed.  I would classify this as a ""must see"" in London."
Super interesting.  Audio guide was helpful.  Did not realize it was as large as it was.  Enjoyed hearing real accounts of some individuals who worked in the war rooms.
Spent a good three hours learning about the cabinet war rooms and reading through all the information in the Churchill museum. Staff are friendly and helpful. The lay out has changed to make it one way because of Covid so was a bit confusing. Could do with the regular signs being covered up whilst the new one way system is in place. The audio tour is really informative.Really enjoyed our visit here - make the effort to come and bring the children.
"I went here years ago and decided to go back, it does seem that it has been extended and now includes a Churchill museum. The audio guides were really useful and there is a lot to see. Allow 1 1/2 to 2 hours for your visit. We pre booked our tickets but it wasnt really necessary on the day. The cafe was nice to rest your feet on the way round. The Churchill museum I found a little confusing, but that said was very informative with lots of exhibits, well recommended"
"We visited here on Jan 26, 2020.  This is a site that is included with the London Pass.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Let us just say this is an amazingly well preserved historical site.  An audio tour is included with your admission.  The tour is very well done and informative.  It was simply amazing to see how Churchill lived here while directing the war effort.  There is so much to see here, so allow yourself plenty of time. We give this attraction a hearty endorsement.  Well with the time and price to visit."
