Built on the site of the assassination of Emperor Alexander II this is an ornate and beautiful church in the Russian style. It is centrally located in St Petersburg and well worth exploring.
"Magnificent church with outstanding mosaics throughout.  It was built over the site of Tsar Alexander's assassination.  The floor of the building was left open at the place of his death to expose the ground.  Hence the place was built on ""spilled blood"".  Although usually quite crowded, the building is an excellent reflection of the glory of God.  Take some time to reflect on the stories told in mosaic on the walls."
Enjoyed seeing this holy ground. Fascinated by the story and the resultant church built on th spot of the ssignation  of the Tsar Alexander II
Impressive building with similarities to St Basil's in Moscow. Central tower under refurbishment when we visited. Didn't have time to visit the inside.
"Beautiful structure, has strong resemblance to St Basil at Red square. the middle tower was under renovation and so covered when i visited. Located by the side of a canal, gets a beautiful view from Nevsky Prospekt."
The Saviour on the Spilled Blood is an incredible sight with the caveat that the outside will be covered in various stages of scaffolding for maintenance over the next 5 years which does not take away from the beauty of the structure. The outside shows the iconic Russian Orthodox Church while the inside takes your breath away with mosaics covering every wall. Take the time to wade through the crowds and wait for breaks of peace and quiet to appreciate the beauty and workmanship of the individual mosaics.
"Amazing visit to this historical church. It was to be demolished in the 1940's but during the war the date was postponed. The architecture is amazing and inside the church is historical and just breath taking. The site where Tsar Alexander was injured is there inside the door, with the pavement and railing intact. Mosaics of Saints looking down upon all visitors. Thank God it was saved."
"Well, it's unlikely that anyone who visits St Petersburg will miss this lovely iconic church. A visit there is not mererly to tick off the box but purely enjoyable and a divine experience. Keep aside atleast an hour for the visit."
"We visited The Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood at night. Unfortunately, the doors close at 5:30 pm. We had the chance to enjoy this sight from the outside only. It is surely having an elaborate façade & brightly coloured onion domes. The work is simply opulent.  The work was carried out by (30) finest artists in the Russian Empire. The church took 24 years to build. The photos uploaded are night photos only. I will visit next year for during the day. SEE photos."
"There are several churches to visit in St Petersburg, and this one is a must-see!  Jump off the City Red Bus and take a tour or go to services to enjoy the cathedral!"
"This building was never intended to be a church nevertheless a cathedral as it had no parish nor priests.No need to buy tickets on line nor in advance since there is not that many tourists in St. Petersburg. Loved visiting in late Fall.Before entering the cathedral see closely the forged iron fence matching the small church that now is a museum across the street. Upon entering the cathedral you will be amazed by the quality of the mosaic works in the interior, many of the signed by prominent Russian artists of the turn of the 20th century. All of them framed by leafy motifs as if tapestry.Do check the canopy standing on jasper columns crowned by a topaz cross. It occupies the spot where the tsar was mortally wounded. Under the canopy there was kept a fragment of a cobbled roadway shed with tsar’s blood. On the day we visited there were a few carnations thrown in the floor.Upon exiting take some pictures and do check the granite plates put on the cathedral with citations of the main events of reign and the decrees of Alexander II. English small plaques are places by the forged iron fence.There is extensive information on the restoration works being done since the seventies with photos depicting immense damage by the Nazi bombing. One can still see a lot of the damage caused by water leaks on the mosaics."
"Church of the Savor on spilled blood now a museum is a unique and breathtaking architecture with unbelievable interior mosaic, supposedly one of the largest mosaic collections in Europe.. The restoration work done is amazing  Be prepared for big crowds. Buy tickets from the machine just outside."
"As part of out our two day guided tour of St. Petersburg, we were taken to the Saviour of the Spilled Blood Church during the first afternoon of the tour.When our tour coach arrived at the church, we were just blown away by the external decoration and architecture of the church.As we walked up to the church, there were large crowds gathered around it. Some people were simply taking photos of the magnificent exterior of the church while others were in a long queue waiting to buy entry tickets. However, because we were on a guided tour, our tour guide took care of the ticketing issues and we were able to go straight in.Once inside, we had some difficulty keeping up with our tour guide simply because the interior was so crowded. We found some parts of the interior of the church to be a little dark. Improved lighting would make for better viewing of the artwork, sculptures and artefacts. Whilst we were greatly impressed by the beautifully decorated interior and especially the central dome, we actually thought was the exterior architecture and decoration of the church were more impressive.This is a “must–see” attraction for any tourist visiting St. Petersburg. However, we recommend taking a guided tour to avoid delays and so that you are provided with useful information about the church and it adornments."
St Petersburg is a very European city so this church is a big reminder you are in Russia. It can be very busy so work out the best times to go. Get some local knowledge. It was busy when we go there but not San Marco busy. It's an amazing structure.
This Church was under maintenance thus we did not see all the domes in their glory but it was still very interesting to learn the history and also see the mosaics.  Take a guided tour.
"I was fascinated the entire time! Beautiful cathedral, worth reading a bit about the history behind its name. From the outside it looked like a gingerbread house, and the inside of the church did not disappoint! Usually when something is this magnificent from the outside, the inside is underwhelming, but not this cathedral! It was so rich with floor to ceiling mosaics (it was actually a bit overwhelming) once you are in, it was difficult to decide where to look, it’s that beautiful. As expected, it’s very very crowded. Book your ticket online in advance and don’t risk booking last minute."
"the church is amazing, the panels on the ceiling and walls are so detailed. The area around the original place of the shooting is fascinating. Beware the church gets packed, its really busy so hold on to your belongings"
"It's an incredible place, completely restored after the second world war. Full of colors, gold, blue..it's really difficult to go out. Keep attention to the people outside with birds...they put them on your shoulders and after they ask you money."
Very crowded like all sights in St Petersburg. But worth going inside to see.  Went with a private guide so got in and out quickly.
Visited this site as part of the two day St Petersburg experience offered on our cruise. As it was a wet morning we did not see this st its best against grey skies and the scaffolding and hoarding also detracted.  However that said and with no time to visit the inside this is truly a fine example of Russian architecture.  The colourful domes are a stand out feature that can be seen from many parts of the city.
"Do not miss seeing this magnificent church! It's a pity that the exterior is partly covered in scaffolding but obviously it's necessary to do maintenance to preserve it. Anyway it's still amazing…but go inside and it's absolutely breathtaking! The walls and pillars are crammed full of strikingly colourful mosaics and the floor is made of pink marble. Photography is allowed inside. This was my favourite place in St. Petersburg because it's so unique and incredible.Just be aware that around the church is a prime tourist spot and we were warned about pickpockets operating, so you need to be careful of what's going on around you and keep your belongings safe."
"There are lots of photo angles from the streets and canals and parks around it. Inside is absolutely spectacular.  Do not miss this church, inside or out, if you’re in St. P"
This is such a unique and beautiful church and a must see on any Saint Petersburg tour itinerary.  Easy to find too.  Before you go read about the history of the church and all the turmoil surrounding its construction.  The inside of the church is breathtaking!  Don't miss it.
"Absolutely stunning church, inside and out!The domes outside the church are striking in colors of blue, green, white and gold.  The interior has been fully restored.  The mosaics are beautiful.  Interesting history of this church.  Don’t miss it!"
"This stunning church delivers beauty both inside and out and should certainly be on any visitors itineary. Looking from the outside with the gold and colourful domes you can't imagine that the inside could be even more beautiful, but the mosaic work has to be seen to be believed. The restoration work to bring it backto its former glory must be applauded."
"Visited (outside) on our walk around SP, near the canal there are a variety of tourist stalls. Didn't realise until later that there is a combined ticket with other religious buildings.  Worth the view from the outside to appreciate the architecture."
Absolutely amazing building and history coming out of the walls. Loved it.Our guide gave us so much history of the buildings and its character.
"We visited the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood as part of a 2 day cruise ship excursion, which got us inside with a minimal of waiting.   Fabulous!   Very busy and hectic, but completely worth the visit.  Lots of old religious icons and art.  Amazing.  Get there!"
"I was so excited to be visiting this iconic building but overwhelmed by all the tourists, of which I know I was one! Unfortunately, a large group of Chinese tourists dominated the inside of the Church, taking great delight in taking selfies holding 2 fingers up✌️speaking on their mobiles and generally being loud and noisy. Shame the Russian Guide who was with them couldn't control them........It's stunning...just try and pick a time when you can appreciate the beauty and history."
An amazing building inside and out. Entry tickets are very reasonable and can be purchased on the machines outside (cash or card). Has to be seen while in St P.
"I went with a guide who explained everything in great detail. Compared to the other churches I have been to where the frescoes were faded or non-existent this one has 7,000 m2 of mosaics so the colours have remained vibrant."
"Loved this church.  Unfortunately right now the steeple is being restored so you don't get the full view.  however, it's still amazing to see.  The inside is very cool.  The mosaics are intricate and beautiful.  You will enjoy looking through the many different mosaics.  Outside, there was nice street vendor art as well.  Highly recommend this stop."
"Loved both the exterior and interior. However, it is more of a museum atmosphere and doesn’t allow for prayer and reflection much. Kazan cathedral has more of a church feel to it, but the interior of this church is breathtaking."
"Beautiful on the outside, jaw dropping on the inside. Skip the ticket booth queue by using one of the automated machines tucked away near by."
Unbelievable artistry. Creating what looks like paintings inside with tiny glass tiles. Hard to believe it’s possible! Really hard to take it all in.
