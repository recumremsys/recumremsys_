"We just randomly walked into the lagoon and wasn’t prepared to swim but the kids were to excited and jumped into the pool with their underwear! It was lots of fun, not crowded and safe to play. The man-made beach was relaxing and beautiful. Had a great time before we headed to lunch nearby, convenient spot!"
"We had been advised not to swim in the waters of Trinity Beach by a few locals and so we decided to visit The Lagoon at the Esplanade on two different occasions instead.  The Lagoon is a really nice place to visit while in Australia because it is a great place for kids to play, there are lots of shops and restaurants, it is family friendly, and FREE.  During the weekend you can even listen to some live entertainment.  My son enjoyed swimming, building sandcastles but more importantly he was happy to meet four nice friends while on holiday.  The kids played for at least two hours building sandcastles and just having fun.  The Lagoon is a wonderful place to visit for both kids and adults alike and should definitely be included on your list of activities specifically if you have children.  Remember to wear sunscreen, bring swimming goggles, and a beach towel.  Lockers are readily available and restrooms with changing facilities are near the Lagoon."
"remember to bring the swim wear when visiting this place.  it is a great place for kids as they can spend hours on end here.  there are life guards there so it is pretty safe.  there is also a change room and a number of BBQ areas around the lagoon.  best thing about the Cairns Esplanade Lagoon is that it is free.  great for family outings.the weather was cool when we visited late August.if you did not bring anything to cook, the Cairns Night Markets is close by to grab a bite."
Love the lagoon. It’s huge. Plenty of shade whilst your swimming if you want to get out of the sun. Great way to cool off. Open until late. Forget about booking a hotel with pool - you’re just going to want to swim here.
We love the pool lagoon. What a great concept. After our tours we would cool of at the pool. Relax and enjoy the surrounding.
"This is a beautiful place to spend a few hours especially if you have children.  The lagoon is 4800 square metres of salt water with a very shallow end to a deeper end.  Lifeguards are present during normal hours of operation.  Very clean washrooms, lockers and even BBQs are nearby. Open year-round and close to restaurants and other attractions.The city have a lot of vision when they built this popular attraction!"
"Overlooking the ocean, this is a great swimming pool and is huge. Plenty of space for all and has coffee chops and eateries right at the pool. Great for kids with many shallow areas for kids, but watch them because there are some deep sections. Even has shaded areas in the pool and a sand beach."
Unfortunately our visit clashed with the pool's cleaning morning - so check before you go. It was closed until 12.00 so we waited in a local café with a coffee for a while. Beautiful infinity style pool overlooking the ocean. Plenty of shade on the grass to keep sheltered from the sweltering sun. Gentle sandy slope into the water and also a shaded area in the pool if required. Toilets/changing rooms and cafes close by. Well worth a visit.
"This public pool is huge and surrounded by much grass to soak up the sun. Sometimes you wonder though, if you should tell someone that they are really getting fried! But it might seem to be a crude come-on. This is not a lap pool though, just a place to cool off. Enjoy!"
What an amazing water park for all to enjoy. Loved the sand base and from city side looks like as infinity pool. So nice to see all the family groups enjoying themselves in the pool and surrounding park. Fabulous amenities and barbed he facilities.
Visited on Saturday 8th September. It was good to see so many people using this man made pool beside the main beach. Cairns has the perfect weather all year round just a pity nature didn't provide a pristine beach as well.
Given the number of salt water crocodiles in the area it is best to use the lagoon. Very clean with lots of space and it is near to the shops for supplies.
Great pool for the whole family. The facilities are excellent and clean with surrounding parkland to relax in. Life guards are on duty. This is a credit to Cairns. Loved it.
"Shade options, shallow areas as well as deep areas. Clean. Toilet facilities available nearby. We really enjoyed hanging out here on our holidays."
"Enjoyed a nice dip with my partner and the lagoon yesterday. A great place to relax, enjoy the sun & go for a swim."
"Great idea of a clean safe pool on the edge of the bay, feel like you are in a resort open to all. Come and go as you please, plenty if space . Winter water temp is a bit chilly though.,Lie out on sand or under a palm tree. BBQ's and picnic tables caters for everyone."
A very good set up for everyone to enjoy. Surrounded by grass areas that are perfect for picnics!The lagoon is under watch by lifeguard so it’s safe and family friendly
Took the kids here in July so it was only 25 degrees. The day we went there was a bit of a breeze so it was a bit cold out but in the water in the middle of winter it was still pretty bearable for adults. Kids can swim in ice water and still have fun so they are no judge.  It’s in a great place and it’s a good idea for councils to have free to the public. I did hear rumours that after dark the backpackers make it a bit of a make out spot but it was completely fine when we were there (it was also during covid so mostly Australians on holidays I’d say).
"Located downtown, the pool is a lovely place to relax and enjoy the water. Many safe ways to enter and very easy for young children to enjoy. Change rooms were great. A great free way to enjoy some time in Cairns."
Into grandson and I thoroughly enjoyed our time. Splashing and frolicking in the water. We will be returning
Beautiful pool to swim in near town. Free and clean and refreshing. Don't leave your stuff unattended as there are locals that ride around on bikes checking what they can grab.
Walking along foreshore visiting lagoon as on previous visit this was only in progress. So impressive and incredibly safe for families
"This is great so safe and clean with nice clean area for changing, showering, even lockers to rent. Life guards on duty to keep everyone safe.  No worries about any crocodiles here... not very deep but pretty large area so not feel Crowded. Grassy area and a little sand area as well. Felt like an infinity pool although the esplanade pool way nicer than the natural beach area is. Enjoy!"
Free swimming pool right on the bay. Relax with spraying art work. Big and a great way to start the day.
"This is certainly a must to visit when you go to Cairns.  The pool is free to use and there are change rooms and toilets nearby.  Very popular with back-packers,Amazingly there is a sandy bottom to the pool but the water is crystal clear.You can lay in the water or on the surrounding area and gaze out over the ocean.  Watch the ships coming in and out of the harbour.  Spectacular lights at night.Lots of restaurants and food outlets just across the road.We found the water lovely although the locals were wearing jumpers !"
"My husband and I whiled away a lovely afternoon here. Dipping in the pool, sunbaking and bbqing. Great facilities."
"Great  immovation by the vouncil. Safe swimming for all ages. Shade and sand as well as a lifesaver on duty most times Clean amenities, kiosk and be too."
Absolutely worth a visit when stayonf im Cairna. Lagoon is very refreshing to swim in and offers excellent views of the harbour. Very busy area so expect to wait for a good spot to sit. Does get less busy close to evening.
A great place to relax throughout the day. Not very populated in the early AM or evening which IMO are the best times to go due to the sun. I got burnt very badly here despite putting on sunscreen multiple times. Be careful and make sure to reapply!
Feel like I own the place/Cairns. We had few rainy days whilst staying in Cairns and it has cleared up so went for swimming at night. How beautiful the place is. Light was glowing side of the wall and was beautifully presented. Depth was just good enough for my kids to enjoy. Atmosphere was awesome and safe guard were doing their job promptly so felt so safe.
"The lagoon is just that, looks like a nice beach, sand and all, but shallow.  Lots of folks bring their kids, 20 somethings sit in the shade and chill.  Us old folks, well, we wander thru, hoping to find a shady spot, usually just cooling off in the water.  stop by and enjoy!"
"How lucky are the people of Cairns. This pool and surrounds are the best public baths I've seen. Friends and family in WA should be very jealous. Cooling, crystal clear and clean water. Well maintained and  has a life guard on duty. Loved it."
"This place is great. Lots of people being active outdoors. Big pool. Skate park. Beach volleyball etc.Restaurants across the street. Place was humming...but peaceful as well. Well lit into the evening, so jo worries there either.Took me maybe less than 30 minutes strolling from hotel to other end near the casino.Nice walk!"
"When humidity rises and temperatures exceeds 40 degrees this is the place to cool down. Nice and clean facilities, changing rooms showers and toilets. Even a McD close by if that you’re prerogative. Remember coins for lockers."
A great spot to visit for locals and travellers alike. Pool is under supervision by trained lifeguards during the day. Plenty of space for a splash! Surrounding bbq facilities are clean and tidy.
