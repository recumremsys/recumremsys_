"Just beautiful, absolutely a must visit if you are in the area. Try to visit later on the day is less crowded."
So I went with my family on a quick trip here and also the Space needle! I would say go after 4pm since the lights at night are so lovely! We booked an Airbnb walking distance (15mins) from the garden. Parking around it is quite expensive so if you can keep the car home or not drive is best. Overall a great experience.
"If you Seattle WA, visit the Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit. What a great experience. Right next to the Space Needle! Make time to do both!"
"When I visited the sprawling Seattle Center on my January trip, I just had to carve room (ample room) for the Chihuly Garden and Glass, perhaps one of the newest attractions and for sure the most hyped. I certainly made the right choice, as though there even was a choice in the first place‚ÄîGO! It‚Äôs an absolute necessity to visit when in Seattle.‚ÄîAdmission is a certain price or an included perk of a combo ticket (e.g. ticket to Space Needle + PacSci Center + Chihuly, or a CityPASS). Research the price that would give you the best value for your situation. I don‚Äôt have the prices solely for the Chihuly Garden and Glass on me now, but I believe they are quite reasonable. The entire place is on the Seattle Center grounds, so parking is handled by the whole center, not the Chihuly ‚Äúportion.‚Äù Parking is not free, if I‚Äôm not mistaken.‚ÄîThere is an on-site cafe (Collections Cafe) and a gift shop, both of which looked enticing. The cafe is on the more upscale side, which I failed to realize prior to stepping in. They offer full lunch/dinner services, rather than a quick snack or pastry. Nonetheless, I appreciated the presence of those resources for visitors.‚ÄîDale Chihuly HAS to be beaming with pride at the care, attention, and breathtaking design of this museum. (Let me just call it a museum, just to maintain uniformity as much as I can.) Every part is GORGEOUS. What a remarkable tribute to Chihuly‚Äôs creativity, wow. Indoors is an extensive layout of distinct yet ever-similar bursts of vivid glass, and each different work is clearly separated by being housed in different rooms. There are no walls or fences to shield off the art from people, letting folks get as up-close and personal as they‚Äôd wish without touching it of course. I won‚Äôt go into too much depth about the art itself, because I want it to speak for itself. Chihuly is just a mastermind at his art, and it is something no one could afford to miss.‚ÄîOne of my very favorite parts (despite the January temps) was the strolling through the garden. Can‚Äôt forget about that word in the title! I adored the subtlety of the Chihuly art interspersed with the diverse plant life and flora; it couldn‚Äôt have been better designed. I captured some of the most aesthetic pictures of my trip in the garden, which I‚Äôll share with my review. Simply spectacular!With those details said, I implore you to visit the Chihuly Garden and Glass. It can deserve an entire trip to Seattle JUST to explore this natural and manmade wonder. Chihuly, Seattle, and I myself are all proud it is number one on TripAdvisor! Go see it ASAP!"
Had relatives come to town who had heard of Chihuly and wanted to visit the exhibit. We got there just before a large tour group and got right into the exhibit. The glass displays were impressive but the added lighting turned the displays into breathtaking art. The exhibit is well worth the expense.
"This is the museum to visit if you are visiting Seattle, especially for the first time. The museum is small, it will take you no more than an hour or so to finish both the museum and the outdoor garden. You can easily pair this with the Space Needle or the Science Center as well. Don't let the size fool you, it houses great content. The blown glass artwork, combined with the ambiance, the lighting, creates a mesmerizing world. Every room was a surprise. My husband and I also attended a session of the live blown-glass workshop, which we found very interesting.The museum gift shop lacks diversity, go over to the Space Needle gift shop if you want more affordable, blown glass wares."
"If you are going to be in Seattle for any reason, you must visit the Chihuly Garden. I've been to several exhibits of his work at art museums, etc. Nothing compares to this experience. Wonderful doesn't begin to describe the works inside. Go. Just go."
"I was visiting Seattle solo and bought the combined Space Needle/Chihuly gardens and glass ticket.  What a fantastic afternoon.  The Chihuly gardens and glass were amazing!  A great solo activity.You start in the indoor museum, which walks you through Chihuly‚Äôs career.  It‚Äôs very impressive without being overwhelming.  One of the first galleries shows beautiful vases inspired by baskets; in this same room, there‚Äôs a gorgeous wall of another Pacific NW work of art, the Pendleton blanket.  And then there are some jaw-dropping galleries:  one with a boisterously colorful ceiling of flowers; another with a huge line of ‚ÄúMille fille,‚Äù in a dazzling array of forms and colors; one with a big boat full of colorful balls and other forms; another full of enormous vases.  It is visually stunning, and there‚Äôs just the right amount of information to accompany each gallery.  Then you step into the gardens, which are beautiful in and of themselves, with Chihuly‚Äôs forms of various sizes dotting and complementing the landscape, all in the shadow of the Space Needle.  What an artist!  The photography opportunities are outstanding, too.You end your visit with a gift shop (per usual for museums); this one had a very nice selection of Chihuly-inspired stationary, calendars, etc., and I obtained a couple of gifts.A really nice visit.  Put this on your ‚Äúmust do‚Äù list for Seattle.  People of all ages and types will be amazed by the art, either for its color, form, or technical achievement."
Loved this garden! The art is incredible and so unique! Will definitely go every time I'm back as it's that beautiful
"Dale Chihuly has his work displayed all around the globe. He grew up in the Pacific Northwest.  Look for the angels in the Persian Glass Ceiling.  Walk clear around the Glass Garden to see it in full.  The lake with the canoe filled with glass art is breathtaking.  Add to your experience by going to the Collection Cafe.  Chihuly is a organized ‚Äúhoarder‚Äù.  üòÉ  Each table has a shadow box filled with something Chihuly collects. Vintage Christmas Ornaments, antique tin toys, vintage fishing lures, etc.  Make sure to look up to see his collection overhead and go into the bathrooms to see his collection of bottle openers."
"Recommended by several friends and online sites, we didn't have time to do the combo Space Needle and Chihuly, but VERY glad we wend to Chihuly.  Be sure to watch a glass blowing demonstration.  5 minute movies in the theatre were also very informative.  Great picture-taking opps."
My favorite activity while in Seattle.  Wish we had seen it at night with lights.  Heard it was excellent.
"Had a marvelous experience at the Chihuly Garden and Glass facility. I have always been an ardent fan of this glass maestro but this was a unique experience. Truly a wonderful way to pass the rainy Seattle afternoon. I recommend you go early to avoid the crowds but take plenty of pictures! If you love his glass work, you will not be disappointed with this experience. Traveled here June 2018."
"Have been to the Chihuly exhibit by the Space Needle more than once and it captivates me every time!  The displays are imaginative and the interplay of color, materials and light/darkness completely engross me.  That we are allowed to take our own photos is very generous and they turn out as if you are a professional.  The various displays, both indoors and outdoors capture the imagination and provide wonderful experiences.  After all, the experience is what you pay to come and see!"
Beautiful museum with a free audio guide. Great place to take pictures and not particularly big. The museum isn't filled with too many descriptions to read so you can listen and learn as you walk through the different stages of Chihuly's career. For a budget traveller I recommend going during the cheaper hours. Go early -- there's always a line.
"Loved the exhibition. We‚Äôve seen Chihuly glass in lots of places in the uk (Kew, V&A, Claridge‚Äôs) but to see the variety here was exceptional. Super interesting introductory talk and some live glass blowing demonstrations. Well worth the visit."
"Since leaving the Chicago Park Garfield Conservatory glasshouse in 2001 awed by the Chihuly glass sculptures we had vowed to visit his Sea-Tac studio or workplace. His ""Garden Cycle"" of exhibits has since been take to 10 other garden settings  around the US and is currently in New Orleans Fortunately, we were finally able to travel to Seattle and we knew he had established this permanent exhibit in 2012 and visiting the Chihuly Garden and Glass was one the top activities of our to-do list.  We bought our tickets on-line.  This visit took place pre-COVID so please check their website for the current procedures and precautions. It was everything we had expected and hoped for when it came to the displays of Dale Chihuly's glass sculptures. His artistic vision - clearly not impaired by the loss of his left eye in a 1976 car accident - is unique and awe-inspiring.  The colors and shapes are further enhanced by the settings, indoors and outside in the garden, the use of both strategically placed lighting as well as darkness, and mirrors.  Be sure to read the descriptions of each of the exhibits in the galleries.  The massive  100-foot long hanging sculpture of the glasshouse is almost too large to take in a single glance.We were able to catch a part of the glass-blowing presentation; we have seen glass-blowing before but the skill needed to see and manipulate the molten glass to create such beautiful objects never fails to fascinate.Be sure to dine at Collections Caf√©; we had an excellent lunch there during our visit."
"We visited during the ""evening experience"" which was a few $$ cheaper and, I imagine, more gorgeous (outdoors) because of the  the night. But whenever you go - GO.  Brilliant and beautiful and breathtaking in every imaginable way.  Thank you Dale Chihuly for making our world a more beautiful place."
Went to Chihuly Museum for the first time recenlty - it was fabulous!  I'm sure I could visit there every day for a year and be blown away (pun not initially intended but left in) every time.  Much of the art is inside - and very well displayed through the creative use of light.  The outside pieces would look different at various times of day/year and would be equally enthralling whenever seen.  The creativity and imagination of Mr Chihuly and the glass sculptures he (and his students) have created were spellbinding.  I have never seen more beautiful (and technically difficult) glass art.  I could see Mr Chihuly's influence in the work of other contemporary glass artists that I have seen over the years. Visiting this museum was the highlight of my trip to Seattle.
"Located next to the Space Needle - the Chihuly Gardens I would say has been one of the most breathtaking art installations I have seen. With pieces inspired by native Americans, childhood memories and the artist's travels - both glass art and drawings displayed are breathtakingly beautiful and filled with energy. There's a live demo on glass making at specific times, live guides and an outside garden wherein glass were included as part of the flora display. A must!"
"If you love glass art then come to Chihuly Garden. Lots of different glass installations around every corner. Loved garden,heard it lights up at night. Did not enjoy employees chasing people because they lowered their mask to drink water. It was a hot day. There are mini talks in different rooms and glass blowing demonstrations. Buy tickets as a combo with needle or citipass, you will save some money."
A must see and visit. Combine your visit with the space needle.  I recommend taking time to watch the videos and to take in the glass blowing demonstration.  The shear scale of the art is amazing. The garden area is a beautiful balance between natural and man made art
"Looking for a relaxing ,fun beautiful attraction Chihuly Garden is a must. Take a walk through the city and enjoy."
Do not miss this great place if you're in Seattle. The glasswork of Chihuly is unbelievably beautiful. Take lots of pics!
"We saw a traveling exhibition of Chihuly‚Äôs work many years ago, but this permanent exhibit along with the gardens is a must do. One of the best parts is the theater which plays clips of various stages of his work. Made the whole experience so much richer!"
"This newer museum in number 1 on TA because Chihuly is a truly gifted Seattle hero. His fantastic works were displayed in a modern venue with gardens. The exhibits started with his early works, of course. But even more impressive were his later works. Don't miss this."
If You are in Seattle this is definitely worth the visit.  These incredible glass displays leave you thinking how on earth did all this glass get blown and carefully placed so beautifully!  The outdoor gardens left me wanting to incorporate glass somehow into my yard.  Stay and catch a film presentation about Chihuly.  Watching him at work on his displays is so impressive.  FYI you can buy a ticket for both the space needle and glass museum and save a few dollars.
"I have loved his art for 20 yrs, and finally got to experience a large amount of his art work in 1 day. Was the best experience ever."
"so many amazing sculptures with so much detail. directly next to the space needle and walking distance from mopop. pieces are gorgeous. go after 4pm for half off admission, even more worth it!"
"What an amazing place, much netter than I expected, go in the afternoon  when it lights up. Take a camera as there are some decent shot to be taken of some amazing glass displays. The exhibition of glassblowing is definitely worth a watch."
"Our surgery at Swedish had to be rescheduled and Nick, the Silver Cloud desk clerk told us about Chihuly. It was awesome, amazing, well worth the effort. Don't miss the glass blowing demo.   I wish we would have watched it twice. Don't hurry and rush through it take your time and enjoy.."
Visited this place twice- last year and this year.  It is  worth to visit .the colorful display will make awe .
Great views and strict covid precautions taken. Bit of a wait for the lift but safety comes first. Wanted to change our time slot due to bad weather and the staff were super helpful.
Colors are breathtaking!  Highly suggest watching several of the short movies in Theater.  (Located to right of outdoor glass blowing exhibit.)  make sure to wait just a few minutes for the next short film.  It will give you another perspective into his techniques.  Also suggest purchasing a combination pass or passes depending on how much time you have.  We purchased Seattle Space Needle and Chihuly Garden  and Glass pass.  You will have several options.
"Make sure to budget plenty of time to visit the Chihuly. The beauty, imagination, creativity and workmanship on display is unbelievable. When you walk into the first gallery space from the ticket station your first reaction may be an intake of breath followed by an ‚Äúoh wow‚Äù. The lit glass and all black gallery space create a singular focus that also allows for beautiful pictures. You are also invited to wander outdoors in the gardens which must be wonderful in summer when the plants are in leaf. Adjacent to the outdoor gardens is an airstream trailer converted into artist workshop and demonstration area with demonstrations scheduled throughout the day. As you exit the gallery there is a theatre with a series of short documentaries about Dale Chihuly which I found important to watch to learn about some of the background or context to the installations on display. Staff are around to take pictures which can be sent at no cost via email. Complimentary coat check a well as a gift shop stocked with all sorts of treasures. As with the Space Needle, taking public transportation rather than fighting with traffic and the cost of parking  reduces unnecessary stress."
