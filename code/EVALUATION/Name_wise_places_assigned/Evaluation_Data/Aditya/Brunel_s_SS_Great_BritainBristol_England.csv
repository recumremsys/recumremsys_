"We have visited the Gt Britain many times and have always loved it, we live very close.  We were obviously cautious taking our Grandson back after Coronavirus. We needn‚Äôt have worried the precautions taken by the whole team were excellent. There was timed entry and we wore masks inside. All the staff wore visors. and there was ample hand sanitiser to use all the way around the ship.  We felt safe and we all loved our visit.  Thank- you Brunel‚Äôs SS Great Britain for the effort taken.  Easy for people with disabilities too."
Visited here on their first week of reopening and we were very impressed with their Covid precautions and felt very safe. Staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable and very happy to share information. The boat itself is fantastic especially inside. So much effort has been made to bring the ship alive. The smells are very pungent and and the sounds are great. Children would love it. We have been to many historical attractions but this really was one of the best. Really enjoyable and a must see when in Bristol.
"Have been wanting to visit the SS Gt Britain for years and certainly not a disappointment!! We found all the staff very helpful. Joe on the deck was very knowledgeable. The whole experience was fabulous really. The Being Brunel part of the exhibition was great!! It was quite quiet when we were there, I expect due to the Corona Virus, but was great for us. I must say I found the interior of the ship in steerage very spooky with all the figures and the ghastly butcheryü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And the baby crying etc but it all added to the ambience! I did feel sorry for the animals on there, destined for death. However the whole experience overall was well worth it!!"
Been wanting to visit for a while and we were certainly not disappointed. So pleased that you could get to every bit of the vessel both above and below the waterline. Staff very knowledgeable and friendly. Well worth the entrance fee and effort.
"Had a fantastic time visiting and will be returning soon to read the bits we missed. Staff were excellent - very engaging, knowledgeable, and friendly.There was clear signage throughout, as well as a one way system to support distancing, and loads of places to use sanitizer. The team have clearly spent a lot of time and effort to reopen, and it shows. Wonderful place. Amazing history. Thank you for helping us have such a super time."
"Had a good 3 hours looking around the museums and boat. The site had recently re-opened and all the staff were thrilled to be back at work, some were even on their first day back. We were greeted by a welcoming gentleman dressed as Brunel (he also took the time to speak to as we left, asking about our visit) who made sure our tickets and booking slot were all in order. The rest of the team clearly love their work as their enthusiasm was infectious. My fianc√© has been visiting the ship on and off for the last 50 years and even he found new exhibits and information to interest him.Hand sanitiser was available throughout the exhibit and the newly instigated one way system was probably a bonus. As we couldn‚Äôt go down into the dry dock because of social distancing we will definitely be back when it has reopened.All in all a morning well spent and memories made."
"Visiting relatives in Bristol on our 8 weeks in UK, we were delighted they planned an afternoon around the docks and aboard the SS Great Britain, an interesting insight into the early days of maritime history.  Being able to thoroughly explore the external and internal spaces gave us a much greater understanding of life on board for both crew and passengers on this steamship travelling between Bristol and UK in the mid 1800s.  A well designed exhibition with museum store and cafe attached."
We had a great experience. Very interesting with many information boards. Unfortunately dry dock was closed due to COVID-19. They had really good social distancing measures in place with all staff where face shields. Hand sanitizer stations everywhere and good one way systems. All this making you feel safe with COVID not being an issue.
"We just came to visit the SS Great Britain, which was fascinating and gave us a real insight into what life on board ship was like. We had not expected the Victorian re-enactors who were brilliant. Thank you"
"Really interesting, spent two hours here, everything well explained, we enjoyed the talk in the dining room giving the ship's history.  Loved looking around at the recreated kitchens, cabins and even the doctor's surgery.Well worth a visit."
"Visited the SS Great Britain and what a brilliant day out. We had a guided tour with Eddie and he was so helpful and informative, you could tell how much he enjoyed his job. The ship itself was really good, lots to see onboard and the experience was realistic with smells and sounds of the areas you enter. The museum was also very good, lots of new information to be learnt when visiting. I would definitely recommend going. If possible, do a guided tour as this is a great way to get even more information.Thanks for a great trip and thanks to Eddie as well for your brilliant tour!"
"Had a wonderful time visiting the SS Great Britain, there were lots of people dressed in Victorians. The ship is really good and well worth a look."
Had been wanting to visit the SS Great Britain for many years but had never been in the area. So I made a decision to visit the area during the February half term. I am really pleased that I did although the weather on the day I visited wasn;t really conducive to a great visit - a warm summer day would have been better. However the ship is impressive. I enjoyed exploring below decks and chatting with the very friendly and informative staff. The Brunel Museum was also a great place to visit; very interesting and informative.
It still impresses me how amazing the museum experiences are in the UK. Having visited museums in many other countries it's hard to find enhanced experiences such as you can find at The SS Great Brittain. Great for pics and to learn history! Recommended for adults and kids as well
"Been here few times already, they improve all the time! If you want to study the history in a fun way, this place is a good choice."
"Timed visit very organised, enjoyed Mr Brunel talking to the queue. Most of the staff were engaging, friendly and informative . This was our first visit and we would highly recommend it All Covid precautions in place and adequate The car park is close and reasonably priced, you can get refunds or you could do what we did and donate the refund to help with the up keep Would recommend this attraction"
"I spent a very interesting few hours visiting the SS Great Britain, its a fascinating ship with an amazing history. The dockyards and Brunel museum are also well worth visiting at the same time and help you to understand a lot more about the ship as well as its creator.Finding the ship is easy as its well signposted throughout Bristol and Parking whilst not free is heavily discounted by showing your parking ticket when you arrive at the SS Great Britains ticket office. Once shown you get some of the parking fee refunded.The ship is accessed through the SS Great Britain museum which is  great idea because it means you do get to know more about the ship before getting on board which makes the visit a lot more interesting. As long as you have the time don't skip the museum as doesnt take long to go round but shouldn't be missed.Moving around the ship is easy and you can choose your own route round so if an area is busy just go to another part of the ship and come back later. The use of figures dressed up and placed in situ to give an idea of the life of the ship has been well done and does help to capture the day to day running of the ship. One thing is for sure it may have been effectively the forerunner of modern liners but the accommodation was certainly very basic even for first class passengers. Walking underneath the ship was also a wonderful way to see so much more about the way it was designed and also the experience of knowing that you were walking around it in the very same dry dock that it was launched from is quite thought provoking.One thing that did slightly spoil the visit was the lack of supervision of a school visit. Thankfully apart from a bit of running around and stupid screaming at some of the figures they were actually not too badly behaved but they did block up areas and were distracting. The biggest issue I had with them was actually sorrow for them that by just leaving them to run around the ship on their own they will have learnt nothing. Because I had studied the ship I was able to answer a few of the questions that some were asking but that should have been the responsibility of the teachers not a fellow visitor. The teachers were on board but just sitting around chatting with obviously no interest in their pupils at all. The SS Great Britain should have rules in place that (like they did when I was at school) you split a class up into smaller groups each group with a teacher who stays with them all the time. And if its not asking too much perhaps actually teach them something about what they are seeing.In conclusion this was a very worthwhile visit and something I would recommend anyone visiting Bristol includes in their itinerary"
"Visited the SS Great Britain and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. My wife was not happy at the thought of another historical tour. But well worth the visit and so good even she wants to come back. Excellent tour, very well laid out and unlike some places here you are encouraged to open doors and look in cupboards, if it opens you can go in or look! You could go round the dry dock and see how the dry dock works. There was a large area devoted to the life of IK Brunel complete with the time lines of his achievements. All in all a great experience, we will be going again next year when it is the 50th anniversary of the return of the ship to Bristol. One other great thing is that the ticket gets you free admission for a whole year!"
Went to see the SS Great Britain for my four time in 40 years. Every time the improvements on the facility and then ship are amazing. The addition of the covered glass to represent the water line is well executed and provides a nice dry area to walk in. The cafe on the river is a nice setting also as well as the Brunel museumGood way to spend a few hours even on a rainy day
"Oh my goodness so enjoyed this visit. Interesting historical and fun,  bought the entry ticket to both the boat and the museum.   There are 3 decks to peruse from the engine rooms the kitchens and the sleeping quarters. Absolutely fascinating to hear the commentary from  various staff throughout the boat and hear about the life story of SS Britain. Loved it. You could even peruse under the boat and again staff were available to answer any questions you may have.  The ticket cost us ¬£17per adult with a ¬£2 reduction for oap. This  includes entry into the Brunel museum which again was amazing.  Just found it so interesting to learn about the life of a complete genius when you think about his achievements.  If you get the opportunity make sure you cross the suspension bridge whatever a feat of engineering,  There is a disabled lift so access appears to be simple I even saw a lady pushing a baby in a buggy which is lovely to see there are no boundaries. The only thing you need to be a little careful of is when you go under the boat it‚Äôs partly cobbled.  Car parking is available a minute away. Please make sure you check out the cabins and the bunk beds.  My husband is on the large size I‚Äôve no idea how he would have coped,  well worth a visit."
"Had a great day out here today; would recommend to anybody visiting Bristol.  The Covid-19 safety precautions have been well thought out - timed entry slots, a one way system, staff controlling access to the bathrooms,   plenty of hand sanitiser and masks worn indoors - and we felt very safe throughout our visit.  The timed entry slots meant there was plenty of space for everyone; lots of other attractions could learn from this approach!   All of the staff we encountered during our visit were really friendly and informative; making a real effort to talk to our 4y/o daughter.  We all enjoyed the dry dock and museums, which have plenty of interactive exhibits to keep all the family interested and engaged.  The highlight for us was looking around the interior of the ship, the attention to detail is incredible - it really feels like you have stepped back in time. Having bought tickets today, we are able to return for unlimited visits for the next year - we will definitely be back."
Amazing staff at this attraction - couldn‚Äôt do more to help my family during our visit especially when navigating with a pram ! Thank you Sarah and your colleague on the top deck for all your help! Also plenty adjustments to make the visit safe but enjoyable during covid 19!!!
I highly recommend visiting the SS Great Britain in Bristol. It is an amazing experience for curios kids and teenagers. The tour is well organised  starting with the victorian dock recreation before boarding the ship. This is a heaven for a history fan like me.  We were lucky as there were not many people around. Make sure to book tickets online before hand.The ship tour and staff are well adapted to COVID19 measures and guidances. Make sure to bring your masks.
"Great visit, very well organised with buying timed tickets online.  Hand sanitiser stations everywhere!  Really interesting tour, not at all crowded so distancing was no problem.  Very friendly and helpful staff and volunteers throughout.  Kids enjoyed it which is always the main thing!"
"not sure what we were expecting, but it exceeded all expectations we had.  Very informative and well laid out.   Being able to walk around the outside of the boat under the waterline was a surpise.  Lots of information before you actually board the boat, so definitely plan at least a couple of hours.  The renovation has been done really well, top class."
Went here and have nothing negative to say about this attraction. If you are in Bristol and have only time to see one thing then I could not recommend anything more strongly. It‚Äôs all so well laid out and with knowledgable helpful staff at every turn.
Visited here as part of city break With my husband my 40th mini break The ship is sheer Amazing so interesting  the crew are so knowledgeable and talk with passion. We loved the whole experience so much that we are planning to come back with the children in the summer mths. If your thinking of taking a day trip or weekend to Bristol you must not pass on this wonderful day. So worth the money which we found to be so reasonable.There‚Äôs An area for packed lunches if your keeping the cost down. Don‚Äôt miss out on a fab day
"Fantastic few hours out. Was unsure at first as I thought the entrance fee was quite steep (however you do get a years pass). But the ship is amazing. I have never experienced anything like it. Even my 6 year old loved it, and it didn‚Äôt even involve computer games! Will definitely come again"
This was a very good and interesting day out. Learned a lot and spend a surprising long amount of time here! Only downside is that it is slightly on the expensive side and you will probably need to get the river ferry to get to the ship
"We spread our visit over two days. Nice quiet out of season visit. Had a short talk on the preservation. This ranks as one of our top attractions, so much history but incredibly well presented. We were physically limited on the walking, but provision of lifts, ramps, lighting made everything easy. The team have really thought through how best to display. Very educational and enjoyable. Wonderful setting, very helpful and friendly staff. Ticket valid 12 months. Car park next door - near the well hidden Banksy girl and earring."
"Educational, interesting and fun! Enjoyed the dry dock seeing under the ship and the displays in the area on the lower deck. Had a good museum packed full of information for those who enjoy reading about the ships history. The tickets include entry for the whole year too so can‚Äôt go wrong, especially if you live in the local area! The staff are amazing and so knowledgable! Would definitely recommend."
Very interesting especially to anyone who likes ships or Victorian history. The restoration of the vessel is excellent with lots of interesting stuff to see. The story of its journey from a rusty hulk in the Falklands to what you see now is also absorbing. Due to needing to start the drive home to Essex we only spent 2 hours but on my own as a history buff I could have spent four. Recommended.
Having been in Bristol several times in the past had never been to see the SS Great Britain was astonished that it was brought back seeing from the photos the state she was in.Anyway the restoration is fantastic all the original are great. The Brunnell exhibition is also worth seeing  Great day out ..
"Visited with my 12yr old son. Very enjoyable couple of hours spent wandering around the museums, boat and playing with the 'hands on' stuff. From start to finish, the staff were approachable, helpful and very informative. Well worth visiting! Tickets are valid for one year and we are very much looking forward to visiting again very soon!"
We went today and it was brilliant from start to finish... even the rain wasn‚Äôt a problem!! Had to book a time slot... a slight que when we arrived - but the actor was amazing at entertaining and involving the children - lots of smiles. We have been here a few times a few years ago and we loved the new bits that have been added... really informative and lots to keep the kids entertained.. And you get 1 years full membership so you can visit as many times as you want ... Can‚Äôt wait to go on a more sunny day...!!
