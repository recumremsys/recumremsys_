We had never visited Blackpool Zoo previously and despite having a teenager in our party we set off to see what the zoo could provide. Car parking was plemtiful and a three pound daily charge was not expensive. Zoo was prepared for the current COVID world in which we live. Hand sanitisers and markings to allow for a safe day. Unfortunately some other visitors don't appear to undrstand social distancing but you can't blame the zoo for that. Get a grip folks. First animal viewed was the elephants which set the tone for the day. Cafe was well laid out for a quick drink and bite and not expensive. All in all we had a very enjoyable day and will return when back in the area. Recommended to anyone.
"I visited the zoo on Sunday it felt like half of Blackpool also visited! The car park was packed and cost ¬£3. Admission was very quick and we were soon walking around the newly improved dinosaur walk,  I loved this. Felt like I was in Jurassic park! Then onto the new elephant enclosure much nicer than the previous enclosure.  We saw loads of animals, they all looked happy and had plenty of space.  The whole place seemed much better than when I last visited and its obvious that improvements are still being made. Had a great day out."
"My husband and I decided to come here for a day out, we normally go to Chester Zoo which is very similar in price but a far larger and superior zoo than here. But we thought, it would be nice to try this zoo out, however it was a bit much that unlike Chester Zoo which is free to park up we had to pay ¬£3.00 here in Blackpool?? Its pushing it a little when Chester is far bigger and more to see!! Come on Blackpool Zoo, we nearly jut drove off as we had nothing but debit cards and the parking meters don't take cards?? In this day and age you are just going to put people off and lose customers. Get rid of your parking fees and you will have more people wanting to come here."
"This was our first visit to the zoo for many years, we visited with our two grandsons (5 & 4 yrs) , it is what it says on the tin. Elephants, lions, sealions etc. A little tired in places and in need of some TLC.The thing that is a major concern is that as we entered the zoo we stopped outside the cafe at the picnic area to get sandwiches out for the boys, only to be attacked by around 30 huge seagulls. Resulting in me sustaining a nasty cut to my hand and the two boys being absolutely terrified for the entire visit.¬†There are signs up telling people no to feed the seagulls, but nothing that points out the consequences of eating in this area. We spoke to some of the zoo staff who were well aware of the issues with these flying robbers.¬†The zoo website has the cute line :-""Please be aware that as we are located by the sea, there is a presence of seagulls that may want to join your picnic""No mention of the problem on their Facebook page at all.Sorry Blackpool Zoo, this is not good enough, you need to actually warn people of the actual dangers, remove the picnic benches, provide more covered eating areas."
"Visited the zoo with the wife and kids (7 and 2), over all we really enjoyed the experience and the kids (and me and my better half) left happy.The price for a fun filled day out with the family is very competitive and I really can‚Äôt complain at all.Highlight for the kids was seeing the giraffes as up close and personal as anyone ever has in their enclosure and the highlight for me was the wide verity of monkeys and seeing the baby gorilla ü¶ç playing, which was the icing on this day out.Some of the enclosures and facility‚Äôs were closed due to covid which was to be expected, I would however ask why one set of female toilets / baby change was closed but the joined on gents toilets were still open? The ladies were using the gents cubicals and fellas were changing babies on their knees because the cue for the main toilets / facility‚Äôs were hhhuuuggee, the bird enclosure was closed as well which has an open (metal wire) cage like roof but some of the smaller room exhibits such as the inside part of the orangutan was still open? I‚Äôm sure there is a reasonable explanation but couldn‚Äôt work it out myself..We ate at the zoo cafe which was outside seating only and was a quick 20 mins wait to be served, staff were on hand to make sure anyone that just wanted a sandwich or coffee were directed to the right and quicker cue,  the sun was shining and we took our food away from the seagull attacks near the cafe to the bench to watch the camels etc which just added to the great day, they normally have you over a barrel with these sorts of spots price wise but I thought the food was a fair price and very tasty indeed! Fancy a picnic? There was loads of people who brought there own food as well.All staff we had any interaction with were friendly and helpful.Social distancing was in place although it seemed like a free for all at times, keep your distance stickers on the ground and plenty of hand sanitiser for everyone.Overall this zoo and day out gets a solid 8.5/10 from me and my family and we can‚Äôt wait to go back!"
"Had a great time at the zoo, parking was easy and only ¬£2.50 to park. We didn't book online so we had to wait and pay at entrance, I would say with the amount of people with picnics would be a sign of how much food and drink cost in the zoo but it was quite reasonable. A good sea lion show and the lemurs are very friendly."
"I booked it for my boys birthday day out as I read reviews on here and it sounded well organised....  I would have to disagree, as it felt like shambles, I know it‚Äôs not the staffs fault but people there were just obnoxious, nobody were fallowing any rules, pushing past you, standing in middle of two way system and just chatting so you had no other option then push past them, there far and few staff there and they weren‚Äôt really doing anything to move people along or remind them to social distance. Food place was just a joke, 30min just to get some drinks, there were stickers on floor to keep people 1 m apart while waiting but did anyone follow them???!!!! NO I  tried to keep my distance but it‚Äôs hard wen someone is breathing on your neck to move you along. I been trying to be super super carful and respectful of other people and rules thru this pandemic. Play area just looked like breading ground for virus as there were that many kids on it at once that you couldn‚Äôt see anything else, yet again no Staff to monitor the situation, so you only can have 3 families watching penguins but it‚Äôs okay to have 100 kids all running around at once?! The other thing I don‚Äôt get is why have they shut all the little drink, snack shops thru zoo, wouldn‚Äôt it be better if they were open so hundred of people didn‚Äôt have to gather in one place?! On way out my little boy wanted to spend some of he‚Äôs birthday money in shop to get some teddy‚Äôs, so you had to wait in line outside the shop, put your mask on. Looked safe, that was until you actually entered shop, everyone were pushing, grabbing  there were no one way system. Or if there were nobody cared about it. Safe to say that from now on I will be avoid any public places as I can‚Äôt cope with other people‚Äôs ignorance."
"We visited Blackpool zoo as a family (2 adults and a toddler). Note under 3s free entry. We used tescos clubcard vouchers to pay. Parking - large Carl park available (pay and display).Zoo - excellent many animals, children areas, parks, eating areas etc. Cafe on-site serving hot and cold drinks. Lots of animals and enclosures, use the site map to navigate so you don‚Äôt miss anything. Will visit again."
"Had a great day out @ Blackpool Zoo unfortunately the experience was somewhat ruined later by uncaring staff so I would just like to warn others whilst visiting this zoo.Basically my little boy (2) managed get free and quickly duck under one of the log fences separating the elephant enclosure. Thankfully I was quick enough to react and managed to jump over the said fence and catch him before he was zapped by the electric fence or got into the elephants enclosure. It was near miss but I feel there there is a potential accident waiting to happen here - Either by an individual coming into contact with the electrified fence or getting in between that and into the enclosure with the animals.Naturally I contacted Blackpool Zoo to raise my concerns who took almost three weeks to offer any kind of response.Then i got this:Dear Mr. BlahBlah,Thank you for taking the time to email with your concerns regarding the fencing at the elephant viewing area.  I would firstly like to assure you that the safety of our visitors, staff and animals is our main priority. The elephant viewing fencing, mesh and warning signage combined with adult supervision of children, has been fully risk assessed by ourselves, and also inspected as part of our Zoo licencing and elephant specialists reviews. The control measures in place have been passed by building regulations. With regards the mesh only being present in certain areas of the elephant fence line, this is because the Ha-ha (vertical drop) is directly behind the fence and the area was meshed to reduce the risk.These assessments are regularly reviewed and we will take your comments on board when we review them.*No apology or any real explanation that made any sense:Now i'm no H&S expert and I'm sure you will agree you can clearly see the hazard in the photos. - Especially to little ones.So at this I decided to ring the H&S officer responsible for this excuse of an email. She basically said I should be looking after my kid and said the photos that I had provided didn't show anything to be concerned about. She then went on reiterate what was in her email.So furious with these comments there is no vertical drop of any description ?? And so many exposed areas where access can be gained into the enclosure. I had to ask her if she had looked at the correct pictures I had sent.Anyway I will be taking the matter up with the relevant authorities but in the mean time I would just like to make people aware. Because as we all know kids do run off or get lost occasionally.Anyway other than that a great day out for the family with good facilities and plenty to see and do. Would recommend but be vigilant!"
A great day out - but no social distancing from the customers We went with 3 and 6 year old both enjoyed it Used Tesco reward points which is always handy! Have to pay ¬£3 to park - no where else to park
"Was our first time at Blackpool Zoo.  Was very plesently surprised at the variety there.  Well spaced out and lots of information displayed on the particular animal.  Only critism is the lack of talks and displays.  It's well beyond lockdown now and if people can be in the stands overlooking the pool then you can restart talks, feeding times, displays etc....  Definitely recommend and will return again rather than going to Chester Zoo."
"Great Zoo, staff were extremely friendly apart from the one girl who was manning the toilets next to the cafe, she was bossy, rude and obnoxious,  spoke to us like something she'd trodden in (date was 30th August) she needs to go back to school to learn lessons in manners especially to her elders. Food in cafe was great value and because we went in early it was quiet.  Lots of hand sanitizer around the zoo. Parking great although costs ¬£3, I'd of thought it would of been free as you pay enough for park tickets."
"We visited the zoo to have an encounter with the adorable Magellanic Penguins, and couldn‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. Excellent customer care/service from all staff, and out keeper Jess made our experience really unique. We loved it. We helped clean the ‚Äòpenguin beach‚Äô, and feed them too! Including hand-feeding a cheeky little one stealing herring from the bucket! The encounter comes with entry to the park, a goody bag, free parking and a tea and biscuits voucher too."
"Blackpool Zoo is brilliant, really interactive with so much to see and do. Get there early if you want to feed the giraffes as it books up quickly. You can feed the birds in a new attraction room which is amazing. There‚Äôs so much to do and see, we‚Äôve been a few times and it really is worth a visit. A good idea to add food onto your booking, the deal is a great saving and the food is not bad!"
"We had pre booked tickets and paid using Tesco Club card vouchers, we had stayed in Blackpool the day before and we planned to visit the zoo before we came home. The torrential rain very nearly put us off bothering at all but decided to give it a go even if we weren‚Äôt there long. On arrival we were only about the 4th car on the car park hence the weather so wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be busy. Before we went in we were able to purchase rain ponchos so that was helpful. So glad we went now and didn‚Äôt come straight home. Staff are doing a great job, good social distancing and hygiene measures in place. The animals were fab, saw them all. Got some brilliant pictures. All the animals were visible either outside or inside where you could walk through and view through the windows, markers on the floor so there were only so many people looking at one time then when they moved on the next group could go through. We had pre booked a meal voucher so went for that when the food started to be served at 11.30, staff are cleaning tables as soon as people move so there is mostly always a table free, glad we had food early as when we had finished there had formed quite a queue to get in. We were there for 3 hours obviously would of stayed longer if it had been nice weather but we had an enjoyable time and saw everything we wanted to see. Lovely place and will visit again."
"Elephant house is great, lovely to see them being challenged to find ways to get to the food.  Saw newly arrived male. Most animals visible, lions, tigers, giraffes, numerous monkeys. Orangutan's and gorilla were playful as ever!  New lorikeet area was nice. They do fly on to you and are not afraid to give you a gentle bite! Penguin pool not very clear. Clear they have worked on trying to ensure areas are not slippy. Largely successful. Sadly our visit was spoilt by a family that think it was acceptable to have a go at our disabled son and his mum for getting too close to their son. May be if they supervised better. Our son then continually requested to go to the car (his way of saying he wants to leave) on his communication device. So we curtailed our visit, missing areas and not stopping at others anywhere near as long as normal."
We went with our 1yr old daughter. All 3 of us enjoyed it especially the sea lion show which was fun to watch. I‚Äôd recommend going 1st thing when the park opens at 10am as it was very quiet and easy to navigate around the park and see all the different animals and attractions. Have to pay for parking which is a bit of a downer considered the price to enter the park but isn‚Äôt the end of the world though and it‚Äôs old school only accepts change so bear that in mind. Good day all round though.
"Visited as a family of four and really enjoyed it. Lots of animals to see including tree porcupines (who knew?!). We also visited the restaurant/cafe placed near the entrance. Queue was long and took about 25 minutes to get food, but the food was plentiful, piping hot, tasty and reasonably priced. We paid ¬£25 for four hot meals plus drinks and we didn't visit on a 50% off day, so Mon to Wed would be even cheaper. There are also plenty of picnic areas/tables dotted around the zoo too if you wish to take a picnic. There are two car parks at the zoo (one is an overflow) and the cost for the day is ¬£3. If you don't have the correct change do not worry as there are staff members with card readers available to take your payment. In regards to covid, the zoo has put many things in place. You have to pre-book a visit as numbers are limited for each day. They currently let 2500 people in a day which is 40% of their usual capacity (this may be too busy for some). All visitors must wear masks in indoor spaces, and most of the staff had masks on too. There are many hand sanitiser stations throughout the zoo and there are also staff members with sanitisers at the front of the queues that are in place for some animals. There are queues for giraffes, wolves and penguins, where the staff limit the number of people at any one time. The queueing areas all have social distancing guidelines on the ground, although some people ignore them (that is not the fault of the zoo though). The restaurant has one queue to get in and has a different, separate exit. The tables inside are well spaced apart and are sanitised/cleaned thoroughly between uses. They have a simple system which is easy to follow and tells you which tables have been cleaned and are ready for use.  All of the animal enclosures have spaced viewing points as well, taking into consideration social distancing. The keeper talks have been suspended for now but instead the zoo has introduced animal talk podcasts which you can access using a podcast app and then listen to at your leisure. There are signs by enclosures letting you know which podcast you need for that area. Each toilet block has a member of staff monitoring them and they tend to let one in as one comes out, to ensure they're not too crowded. When it comes to leaving the zoo, there are two lanes - one is for the shop and one is for the exit avoiding the shop. Other reviews have said the shop was very busy and chaotic, but when we left it looked really quiet and people were distanced. We didn't go in the shop though so I can only comment on how it looked when we went past. In all I think the zoo has done a pretty good job of making the site as safe as possible for visitors, but be aware that not everyone likes to follow the guidelines. As an outdoor space though it is quick and easy to create distance between you and the 'invincible ones', and easy to take a route where there are fewer people. We really enjoyed our visit and we felt safe, so wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to others. Visiting animals in the open air is very therapeutic and if numpties get too close, you can always give them a sharp jab in the ribs with your elbow."
During a week in Blackpool forecast for rain we picked a dry day to visit Blackpool Zoo. Used Tesco vouchers so it was cheapish day out. Shopping the shop with my grand daughter made up for that. Well laid out Zoo and we managed to fit in most of the feeds and shows. Would certainly go back.
"Fabulous zoo but we went during covid 19.  What is the point of booking if there is no timed entry? How do we maintain social distancing when we have people so close behind us they are stepping on my heels? There should have been timed tickets. Also dismayed at how dirty the windows were on the animal houses and the colour of the penguin water was so revolting you couldn‚Äôt see the penguins in the water. Having been a few times we know this is usually a clear blue, not sludge green. All in all very disappointed by the lack of covid awareness in a town that is close to another lockdown."
"Have been to Blackpool Zoo many times but not left a review its a good day out its smaller than Chester zoo so easier on the legs not as far to walk between enclosures actually saw the red panda which i have yet to see at chester.Love the Giraffe house. Entry price is reasonable and cheaper to book online.Was not too impressed with the cafe, dirty cups alongside clean ones not much choice in food left, toilets were dirty too.Gift shop have good selectionOnly gripe was having to pay ¬£3  to park luckily hubby had some change on him, no mention of parking fee when i booked online unless i missed it."
"We had a wonderful day, COVID precautions are in place they did not affect our visit and made us feel safer. Animals all seemed happy, loved the elephant and giraffe enclosures. See you again soon."
"Had a great time at this zooWell set out and great viewing of all animals. The giraffe and elephant enclosures are well set up for viewing inside and out. The gorilla mountain is impressive with lots of areas for them to roam. One criticism would be big cats, would like more viewing angles to see them. I would visit again."
What can I say apart from the queue being long to get in everything else was great!! Really clean. Loved watching the apes being fed.the seal show was really good and managed to get a seat ok. Spent whole day here we all had lots of fun.highly recommend
"Firstly I would not want to visit on a day where it was not limited numbers. It was absolutely packed! Got there about 10.30 and car park was nearly full. We decided as we had our 1 year old with us to eat as soon as we got there at the lake view cafe, entered for a polite member of staff to direct us to the other entrance if we wanted to eat in which we did. Joined already fairly long queue, to get to the front to find out it was for the toilets! A a little more clarity from the staff and possibly some signage would of been helpful as this was very frustrating. Queue for the toilets at each point was fairly big, but understandable due to the safety restrictions. On both toilets I visited, the first the toilet in the baby change was out of order and in the second the baby change was in the femaleToilets both times it was a massive inconvenience to have to go hand the pram over to the other half and have to rejoin the queue to go to the loo myself. There were queues to see quite a few of the exhibits, which again we were fine with. However other people seem to have no awareness of social distancing! Also queued too see the wolves, to find they were nowhere to be seen! A heads up from the staff member would have been nice to save us all the bother of traipsing up the walkway for nothing to see, I know it‚Äôs not the staff members fault they were in but she could of just let us know they were inside. We did have an enjoyable day and enjoyed a lot of the exhibits. Just far to busy."
"Visited here on a Friday afternoon. We went expecting there to be queues however it was quite a bit worse than we thought. Distancing seemed a little excessive and we waited for 15 minute stints all over the park. One being just to see the tiger asleep. Once you had queued and entered the houses you then felt pressure from behind to get in, have your look and then leave... Just not the same experience at all. Consistency wasn't quite there either with some enclosures not advertising distancing and queues at all.. whereas some were really strict. This is all when picnic areas were jam packed and children's play areas in full flow..Despite all of this it is still a very nice zoo with a good selection of animals! Recommended for all the family.. Just be prepared to wait!"
We had a lovely day at the zoo today. Been many times. We wanted to see the new little birds and feed them however they closed this area very early (hours before the zoo closed) very disappointed with upset children. All other animals and displays were fantastic. The train was also closed. ‚òπÔ∏è
"Visited the Zoo as a birthday treat. We have been before but came especially to see the Red Panda. The day we had in the zoo was great. The staff have tried their best with the COVID-19 procedures. Unfortunately sometimes the guests forgot and got a bit close so we moved on. Loved seeing the Red Panda and saw the Elephants for the first time also. Sorry no pic of the Red Panda, they are on the camera üòä"
"Went on Aug 9th 2020. Have to say we loved every bit of the zoo, hundreds of animals, all easy to see. Clear markings & guidelines for Covid. Staff were friendly and approachable. We spent about 5 hours here easily and stayed all the way until closing time. Went with 2 kids, ages 12 & 6 both were very happy. The animals are so memorable and feel like they interact. Would love to come again and would highly recommend!NOTE TO PPL COMPLAINING ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING ETC: the zoo has put into place markings etc and staff helping out, if your that scared then why have you come to a PUBLIC ATTRACTION?! And if the zoo started limiting tickets even more then you would be complaining there‚Äôs no tickets available! Remember millions of ppl have been affected by this whole Covid situation, appreciate that at least we have places like Blackpool Zoo to go to! Shut up & make the most of it!"
"This was my 2nd visit to Blackpool Zoo, & alot has changed in those 9 or 10 years!! Came with my aunt & we had a great afternoon!! So much to see & to experience animals so close is wonderful. Most people only ever see these animals on TV!! We got 50% discount tickets as we booked thru Blackpool Promotions. Was well worth it!! I absolutely love the addition of the otters...such a beautiful pair of wee show offs..!! My favourite experience of the day was getting the chance to feed & hold the beautiful Lorikeets...im not a huge fan of birds tbh, & i wasnt sure how id react to them flapping around me, let alone landing on me, but these little guys were amazing!! One took a shine to my bracelet & ring, & I thought id be losing then!! As myself & my aunt had full hands, the keeper very kindly took over photo duties!! I can honestly say this was one of the most amazing experiences of my life!! Now, a few wee complaints....ALL the tables outside the cafe were wobbly...I ended up wearing a lot of my Frozen Fanta...!! The Tiger....as beautiful as it was to see, the day we were there, the poor thing was pacing the same path, & it was quite distressing to see....Overall,  we had a wonderful day, & slightly better weather than the rest of the week!!"
"Me and my partner visited here while on holiday to blackpool. It was quite hard to see the big cats. The elephants were great to see. You have to pay for car parking even if you are a paying guest, there is no card option so make sure you take ¬£3. Took us about 3 hours to walk around."
"Wow!! Went for my nephews 4th birthday and he was excited to see the animals but also do the dinosaur walk. Even after showing him in the months running up to it, we didnt realise they had some animated dinosaurs  - this was just the icing on the cake for him.  We all loved it (wife, son and his wife, 1yr granddaughter and myself on a mobility scooter). He kept running back and forth shouting out what the dinosaurs were when he seen them - probably could have left after this.The zoo itself is great. Very well laid out and so flat and very easily accessible (usually have a manual wheelchair but hired a scooter but felt comfortable that it would be an easy job for someone pushing the wheelchair! )The enclosures were fantastic and seeing such amazing animals was great. Favourites had to be elephants, gorillas and orangutan!! Although not a massive zoo you could spend all day there - I know we could have. Animal shows, encounters, plenty picnic areas.  Staff were great and patient - even when our nephew was gibbering away during a talk. This is very definitely a worth while visit and worth the price. Will be returning when back in the area."
"I honestly don‚Äôt know why they have got such bad reviews off people who visited during covid.The zoo have made plenty of changes, one way systems in places, face masks worn in all indoor spaces, plenty of hand sanitiser stations around, queuing system to get to the very busy animals like gorillas etc. Queues to enter cafe and only one way in and one way out, all tables and chairs sanitised after each use.In all honesty if you‚Äôre still moaning after all this is being done it‚Äôs probably best you stay home for now.We visited today for our sons birthday and had a fantastic day. We actually enjoyed the changes made as it meant less shoving and pushing from people to see the animals etc.We‚Äôre all adults and it is our duty to socially distance ourselves, however it is quite impossible to always socially distance in a busy place like a zoo so it‚Äôs more about common sense. We didn‚Äôt have a problem at all throughout the day. Queue moved quickly for food, however I do feel it would be easier to have two separate queues. One for hot food, one for cold food. We only wanted sandwiches and had to queue for about 15 minutes, which when you have a toddler can become rather difficult. And when we got inside the cafe queue it became apparent it was probably taking so long as most people ordered hot food. It wasn‚Äôt until leaving the cafe we noticed a little bit serving ice cream which had the odd sandwich so we could of probably been in and out in a few minutes had we known that was there.We did only buy food as we knew it would be 50% off with the eat out scheme, what we had was nice but I do feel had we paid full price it would of been way overpriced.Kids playground was really busy which we had no issue with. Seen others moan about this but it is quite difficult to make children distance themselves. All they want to do is play.My only other niggle is the fact the baby change has no toilet in it, so I went in the ladies toilet and the baby change unit isn‚Äôt even in it‚Äôs own cubicle, it‚Äôs right next to the sink which to be honest I really didn‚Äôt like. I had to change my little boy as he‚Äôd fell in a puddle and he was stood up on the changing unit with no clothes on with people just stood staring whilst waiting for sinks. Overall we will definitely visit again! Glad we went. We went to Chester zoo back in July andBlackpool zoo was a much more pleasurable experience for us!"
"Visited this zoo on 19th September 2019.We had an excellent day. Being midweek and term time it was not too busy. We were amazed how close you could get to some of the exhibits. Especially the big cats, Elephants and Giraffes. Feeding times were spaced nicely and in an order that you are not backwards n forwards over the same areas time n again.Would reccomend this attraction for Anyone to visit n not just families. As a disabled gentleman I found all areas to be fully accessible throughout the zoo."
visited this zoo on recent hotel break to blackpool excellent value bought our tickets from our hotel .so didnt have to que to get in plenty to do and see. plenty of places to sit down for anyone with mobility issues there also a little open top railway to get to other bits of the park.
