"Lovely couple of hours spent wandering around the castle, very well kept, good informative museum, amazing views, has a cafe, clean toilets, we all enjoyed our visit here.  Shame the prison side was closed, so will just have to go back and revisit"
"Great views and history, a must! Spend a few hours going around this magnificent castle, learning about Turkish history, overlooking the Bodrum marina. Very close to the city center."
Ok the titles a bit dramatic but I found the boat artefacts exhibit with the castle so interesting. Originally built by the crusaders it's an imposing sight from the Kos ferry and when you're within it's walls. There was an art exhibition when we visited but I have to say it didn't look that erm ...  competent
"My husband and I visited the castle as part of a cruise excursion. It offers beautiful views of Bodrum and some interesting history. Give yourself between 1 to 2 hours to tour the castle. The many rooms displaying artifacts are quite small and get crowded with large cruise groups. The grounds are well-maintained with beautiful flowers. You may see a few peacocks roaming around as well. There are a significant number of steps and inclines to traverse, so wear good walking shoes. Some of the highlights include the ancient coins, jewelry, and glass gallery. Unlike others, we were underwhelmed by the reconstruction of a ship's hull. Overall, it was not an amazing excursion, but it gave us something to do in Bodrum.Tip: If you are cruising and arrive to the castle by boat, we recommend not taking the boat back.  My husband and I were able to take a leisurely walk back to the cruise ship port. The walk took us through the popular shopping area, where we were able to eat, buy souvenirs, and have afternoon tea."
Extremely beautiful! History to be seen! Very well maintained museum piece. Lovely garden. Beautiful view. Very good audio guides. Missing Bulgarian language.
Well worth a visit .the views from around the castle are great and the inside history is really great . There's a cafe and shop inside the walls. Takes a while to walk around and can get warm as there is on bits of shade.but this said I would really recommend a visit .there are English voiceover handheld tourist dictafones available and the information boards are also. In English.
You would enjoy visiting this castle not only for the monuments inside but also for the numerous nice and enjoyable views you would have over the whole city. Make sure to have your cameras fully charged when visiting this place. :)
"Very atmospheric and impressive. Fascinating exhibits. Shady places to rest awhile but the walk up not too taxing. History really comes alive and the entrance fee if 30 lira is very reasonable for what you see. Allow ,2.5 hours."
"This was a stop with celebrity cruise lines. Visiting this old Castle and picturing living during the times, provided me with a wonderful afternoon of speculating life in ancient Turkey. Once you’re done, don’t forget to take a walk through the marketplace."
"We visited the Castle after seeing the Mausoleum of Halicarnasis. Spent quite a few hours walking around the towers and galleries. Signs and artefact descriptions in Turkish and English. We took one of the digital guides - good value and gave great additional information. Galleries have air con. so good to get out of hot sun for some cool air.Lots of artefacts including brilliant glass exhibition, amphora, Byzantine  merchant ship, coins and some jewellery, statues and remains of the 'Princess of Caria'.  Note: if you go to the Dungeon you must come back up the same stairs as you go down.The castle is not suitable for anyone with limited mobility. Gift shop is small but has a number of good books on the history of the castle and the Mausoleum in various languages."
Visited on a day trip to Bodrum from Kos and were pleasantly surprised how well preserved the castle is. Entrance to the castle was very reasonable and the explanations of the various areas of the castle were in Turkish and English increasing the experience. There are several rooms that have presentations and some thankfully with air conditioning which give relief after walking up several steps to reach the various levels. The views of Bodrum from the top of the castle are sensational.
We paid 30TL each for entrance into the castle and the museum and it was well it. It is a really nice day as you can spend as long as you want in there. I think I was there for around 3 hours. The views are amazing and you can get some great photos. Defo worth a visit if you have not been before. Enjoy x
"The site joins history, science and views. History of the castle and the trade over Aegean sea! Science with underwater archeology museum and the views from top are excellent (see my pics) over bodrum bay and marina! All this only for 30 TL or 10 euros ! Loved it!"
The castle gives you a nice overview of an interesting era in history. Combining the castle with the underwater archeology museum makes it an exciting place worth visiting
Not the biggest or best I've ever visited but does have a collection of ancient artefacts. Good views from the walls. Has a reconstruction of a sunken ship and some of the things recovered from it. A reasonable distraction for a couple of hours with a 7 euro entry fee in 2017.
"Was great experience ! Absolutly go there ! Views are beautiful, we got our best photos from there !"
The castle is open but one can only visit partly and just two rooms. The tickets are full price what is strange because you can’t see everything. Take water with you restaurants were not open when we visited end of May. Am sure that when it is finished it will be an excellent place to visit for a view hours
Wow ! The views from the top took my breath away. Worth every penny. Beautiful grounds and lots of interesting history.  Make sure you take water with you as you will get hot. It's like a trecking a desert in there.
"Went to Bodrum on a cruise stop and the Castle is one of the major sights that you could see there.  It is beautiful and full of history.   I went on a guided tour provided by the cruise, but really its not needed.  It would have been much easier to just go around ourselves.  The Castle is quiet large and is filled with artifacts found from shipwrecks (Underwater Archaeology Museum), which were very interesting.  If you are in Bodrum for the day, I would check this place out!"
Nice place to visit. Great view of the city worth while the walk. Take comfortable shoes and a sun hat
"I’m sure the castle is a great visit if it was open. Having read other reviews on here, I was expecting the closure. It’s a pretty place to visit & take a few photos. The walk there through the main shopping street isn’t particularly nice.The shop owners (mostly selling the same fake designer clothes/bags etc) hassle you no end. They are very insistent/forceful you go in their shop, I have heard of people being forced to buy things once in there but I don’t know for sure. I did see a few people get drawn into conversation with the shop keepers usually with ‘let me show you something in here’ & led in by the arm.Our cabin steward from our cruise ship also told us some shops don’t like you browsing & insist you leave unless your going to buy.If you keep walking & avoid eye contact we found we were okay on the walk back."
I was disappointed with my visit and felt that the castle was over-rated. The fortification itself was impressive and stands between two lovely bays with a commanding view of the harbour. Views from the castle were excellent but the interior had little of interest. The underwater museum contained many amphorae - all similar- and one old boat. Much hype about very little ! The castle walls were built with huge blocks of stone taken from the ruins of the mausoleum. The restaurant served good coffee . Save yourself the entry fee and admire from the outside.
The picturesque castle hosts also a museum. It offers nice views over the city and the marina. Select a day when the temperature is moderate. Get a hat and carry some water.
"The castle was used as a forte, so it's by the sea. The view is amazing, and at the sunset is very beautiful. Watch the opening and closing hours, cuz one day we missed it. (Opens at 9 and closes at 17:30). Good visit."
It's a bit confusing but u 'kill two birds with one stone' This extensive site holds many interesting features we loved the British tower with its many artefacts but the other rooms and gardens are great!!! Enjoy we did
"Went with 4 friends. All enjoyed the visit. Lots of steps so not buggy and wheelchair friendly but plenty of space for kids to run around. Great views and exhibitions. And fun things like an ottoman photo scene, cafés, lots of towers and a mocked up dungeon with a cool staircase into the mountain. Nice to spend half a day there. Great views over the bay and marina."
"This was an unexpected surprise, we arrived via a cruise ship, walked through the town and found the castle. It's confusing to find the entrance, keep walking till you see a ticket booth.  You also can buy the audio after you enter the castle at a separate booth.  It's a lot to see, many uneven steps, but if you are up for it, totally worth it!  Give yourself at least an hour and a half."
This monument is the highlight sight to visit in Bodrum! don't miss it! a great view to Sea it has and also Musuem inside! you can take memorial photos on the roof
"Got a taxi into Bodrum to look round the castle. Half of it is closed, yet admission is still full price. Not much of interest to see and no audio guide or anything to make any sense of what you are seeing. We've been here before yet this time round very disappointing. Wouldn't recommend unless you're in Bodrum already and don't mind paying 48Tl each (about £7) to walk around something that would probably be free in the UK."
The castle is fascinating the moment you step inside. It looks overwhelmingly fascinating from the outside aswell. Has a lot of history to it
"Well worth a visit, we accessed the castle having arrived at Bodrum Marina by water taxi; the castle is then a couple of minutes' walk along the waterfront. In fabulous condition, the exterior and interior of this fascinating building are well worth a look, as are the historical artefacts and displays within. Allow a morning for a thorough look around."
"This place is great to learn more about the history of the area. It is really interesting and offers you great view all around it. There is also a museum in it. It however has lots of steps inside which can be very tiring especially during hot weather. So try to go there early morning or late-afternoon (be sure to check the hours though!) or a cloudy day. Don't forget your hat, sunscreen and water!"
As per the title good views and a good museum. Do take water round with you as no where to buy till you leave any and quite hot and sunny. Badly sign posted but in its own way fun to wander round and find the exhibits.
Enjoyed the visit to historical castle with great views. Unfortunately a lit of renovation is being undertaken and quite a bit was closed.
Very amazing view from the castle. Visiting bodrum castle is a must. 30 liras is cheap for what you see
