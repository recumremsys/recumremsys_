beach very clean and smooth no stones. was lovely to see the surfers having fun on the waves and seeing the beach life guards still there
Lovely sandy beach which is well maintained and overseen by lifeguards. Plenty of places close by to grab refreshments. Have to stroll along here and paddle even if it is cold
Really enjoyed visiting this beach. Nice and sandy lots of stuff to do near by and great views. Find most beaches in the UK are too rocky but not this one!
"Stunning golden sand with a lovely esplanade allowing you to walk from Boscombe to Westbourne/Sandbanks, with views to the Needles and Isle of Wight to the East, and Old Harry Rocks/Isle of Purbeck to the West. Litter free with plenty of facilities and, by the pier, ready access to the Lower Gardens for a relaxing time by the stream, or mini golf for the more active. In my view, without doubt Bournemouth is the best seaside resort in the UK!"
Went there today to use a Christmas present. Lovely long beach with plenty of drink and food places along the way. Great morning out.
"Absolutely gorgeous, this beach is 7 miles of lovely clean sand.  Cleaned every morning and a pleasure to look at and to walk/sit on. We did not go on the pier due to the cost. We particularly went the last weekend in August and enjoy the Air Show over this lovely beach.  Perfect"
Weather been sunny and dry this weekend.What a pleasure to go down too the beach at Bournemouth.Very long sandy beach very clean and tidy Nice long walk along the sands although the sea was a bit cold other people were swimming.I don’t think anyone would be unhappy with this seaside plenty of cafes and restaurants.Observation wheel very popular along with the winter gardens and pier. Look forward to our next visit.
"Good beach. Sandy and clean. Beautiful views all  around. Lots of people in sea, surfing, in march. Saw they had tractors clearing the prom walkway of sand that had covered it overnight.  The amount of sand seems to have increased, as it's now very deep & level with prom,  covering steps"
The beach at Bournemouth is very clean. Lots of clean promenade to walk on. Lots of families using the facility. Sat and watched the world go by for a long time. Don't just stay in one place walk a long the sands prettier away from the town entrance.
"Lovely beach, clean with many facilities. Go towards Boscombe and the number of people reduces dramatically. In a sunny Tuesday in September we were the only people there!"
Really nice beach things to do including arcades a pier and a few shops. Theres an oceanarium just 2 minutes from the main beach centre. That gives something to do
"Beautiful beach, with pier and promenade. Plenty of places to get ice cream and teas. Has an area for dogs"
"Been here twice. Beautiful views of the sea, clean. Great place to visit with family. Bournemouth is really the best beach I've seen in the UK so far. Loved our time here."
Long coast and beach here. Well worth a long stroll. Keep very clean too. Lovely pier as well. Sea 8s a bit choppy though.
Breathtaking Views and amazing vibe on the beach. Best experience ever. Loved it. Bournemouth Pier is my best and love the view from there
"Lovely, usually clean beach. Soft sand on beach, lots of attractions and facilities nearby. Public toilets available right next to the beach as well as places to eat and drink or just to grab an ice cream. Has a lovely pier you can walk along to admire the views out to Swanage etc."
Have visited the beach on many occasions and it’s the longest stretch of sandy beach outside Miami Beach. You can run or cycle for miles and miles come rain or shine. Sunrise is always a memorable occasion.
Stayed at the Holiday Inn close to the beach within walking distance. Bournemouth has a lovely sandy beach would be great for children. But not in January too cold. Even though the surfers were still in the water. The pier is very nice.
"Love Bournemouth and the beach. Had a lovely day, and our little pup loved it too. Pier has amusements for kids, and an amazing ice cream shop just outside. Pasty place just on the beach too which is yum. And only a short 10 min walk up into town"
"Clean, beautiful, a happy place to be. Littering discouraged with beautiful posters and plenty of waste and recycling bins"
Spent a lovely hot day on this beach . We bought a chair and 2 parasol from a shop opposite the beach. People observed social  distancing on the beach.  We  rented an apartment nearby so we left our car at the apartment otherwise we would have struggled to find a parking space.  The walk up from the beach to the road is quite arduous  though. There are toilets opposite the beach.
Dropped in for a week to an AirBnB flat and walked the beach. Great expanse of mostly rock free sand with breakwaters. Much better than we expected. Pleasant walks with most people keeping distant.
"My family adore this beach, having visited more than a few times this summer. It’s a great atmosphere, local toilets, refreshments and fresh water to rinse off. Be advised during summer to arrive early to avoid disappointment as car parks fill up quickly. In my experience, arriving later than 10:30 didn’t leave much room for parking. Bring a picnic and enjoy a whole day here."
"Visiting Bournemouth, staying in Boscombe. Obvious option into town is the bus. However for a real treat, if you are in this area is to walk along the beach, or adjacent Undercliff Rd. Not necessary to walk on the actual sand if you prefer not to. From Boscombe Pier to Bournemouth Pier is probably about 35-45 mins depending on how many distractions you come across. I certainly never thought that walking along a beach on December would be so rewarding! The timing was important, just as the sun was setting on a clear cold day. The waves crashing into the beach and glistening in the declining sunlight. If you have the opportunity, treat yourself to something special!"
Visited the beach & was so impressed we felt like we was abroad. So clean & could see our feet in the water. Good amenities nearby & enjoyed a fab cornish pasty for lunch
"Visited with my partner for a walk along the beach. Sand was quite nice and the beach area a good size. There was nothing that made it great, it was just nice."
"Stretching for miles in both directions, to Christchurch and Poole, if you come here on a warm summer day you can have a happy trip walking alongside the beach or riding a bike, but bikes aren't allowed between July and August. Go on the beach to go for a swim, have some food with family, play volleyball or just sunbathe or make a sand castle. You can go along Bournemouth pier and even go up a large tower at the end and go on a zip wire back down to the beach. During the summer months, it feels like going abroad, except without the hassle of flights, hotels and passports. There are plenty of restaurants, fish and chips places and toilets if necessary dotted along the beach if you need anything. On a hot day you'll see the place is packed and see people of all backgrounds walking along enjoying the sunshine. You'll also see small beach huts lined up side by side in the hundreds which you can buy if you'd like. The sea also changes, on some days you'll see large cruise ships, or even an oil rig, maybe even para-surfers. If you look at the cliff in the far distance leading to Christchurch, you will see what looks like a polar bear on the side of the cliff. Go out for a nice walk and enjoy the sun, one of the best beaches to visit in England."
Visit the pier then go either left or right instead of staying at the main part of the beach. It’s less packed. You can have bbqs after 6pm and it’s all very family friendly.
"Beach was lovely and clean during the day possibly due to the time of year with fewer people on the beach. Meet a lovely local lady walking her dogs, Harley and lucky who was friendly and lady was extremely warm and made us feel welcomed with tips on where to park and best places to eat. In the evening, saw a few rough sleepers and some drug taking in the huts, the council’s homeless outreach team should really visit these areas in the evening and offer help, support and accommodation. Is definitely worth a visit during the summer but please help the homeless and rough sleepers"
First time visit and really enjoyed it. You would think your in a different country. Walked along the seafront in red hot weather.
"It was our first time on holiday in Bournemouth and we had no idea what to expect. You access the beachfront in a quite compact central area where the pier is located. The beaches of beautiful White Sand spread out on either side of the Pier and seem to go on for miles. you can either walk along the pedestrian pathway or dip your toes into the sand and use the sand as your walkway. At the time we visited there were quite a few activities including the big wheel just off the beachfront, an aerial runway that runs between the pier and the beach and the usual beach sports including volleyball. On the first occasion we visited the beach rain mostly stopped play except for the die hard surfers the waves were quite large and amazing to watch. There are rental beach huts close to the pedestrian walkway facing towards the beach. Later in the week the Sun Appeared and it was nice and warm which in turn made the Beach Busier however it was not overcrowded and people did maintain social distancing. Regarding amenities these are only around the central area near the pier. I did not see any amenities along the sections of beach which extended away from the pier.I have to say it was a real shame to see several cruise ships moored offshore and clearly going nowhere."
Was really nice but no one was social distancing but you could just visit when it’s not as busy! Personally didn’t feel it was awful so it’s nothing to worry about! People were wearing masks. Was very clean and kept looking nice.
Day visit to the beach. Not the cleanest. Hate people leaving cigarette stumps. Just take your rubbish with you. Lovely views up & down. Lots of new attractions from last time we where here. New crazy golf & Resturant. Nice to see a big wheel. Cruise ships waiting to start work again in the sea. Lovely day out for all ages. Great to walk through the park to Bournemouth town center. The Balloon has gone. This was a shock. Pier was lovely to walk along.
Lovely beach. October half term. Not very warm so beach quite empty. Was just after a storm so sand had blown up all over the prom. Was interesting to see. Prom goes on and on. We hired a couple of uber bikes and cycled from end to end.
Tried to visit the beach on a warm  mid week day in mid July.(Not an exceptionally hot day and before the main holiday season started on 31st July).  The beach car park was closed  because we were told to control crowds. There was masses of room away from the pier. Youngsters are easily able to climb down  form the Overcliff drive and up again but for more elderly  people who wanted to take chairs to sit on  or were  unable to walk long distances or climbs steep hills it make it impossible.  Businesses told us that the council's attitude was putting off visitors and affecting their businesses.
