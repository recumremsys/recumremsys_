"The nail-making masterclass is a must-do as long as you bring yourself all the way down to this historical town. Edward will tell you everything you have to know to be a good blacksmith back then, while you forge your own old-fashion nail. Don't forget to try out the chain mail armour, only real man can handle this weight of time - 27kg in total! After all, big thanks to Nadezhda and Elizabeth for taking good care of my sister, who didn't feel well then."
"A working blacksmith shop, this place is a great spot for tourists and locals alike. Took a master class there and it was both educational and a lot of fun. We all made nails which were great fun to make and a great souvenir."
