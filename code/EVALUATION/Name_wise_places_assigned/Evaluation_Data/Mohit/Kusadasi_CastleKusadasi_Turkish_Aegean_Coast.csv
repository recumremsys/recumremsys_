"Looks good but its just a locked building site, nothing there to see really. Such a shame...................."
"Took a walk to the castle after lunch. Its worth a look only takes about half an hour to walk around, there's a whale skeleton inside the castle it's self and some caged pigeons, hense the name pigeon island and peacock's that have seen better days."
i enjoyed the view specially at nights and got some nice fotos. recommended to get there at sunset. didnt have time to visitinside the castle.
"Seems expensive when you book (can't remember but about £30) but the buffet was excellent, all wine (unlimited) and soft drinks included, the setting is amazing and the show extraordinary. If you don't enjoy this night out I just don't know what to say!"
"This place has free entry so after a bit of a walk , was nice to see a cafe. Walk round the castle walls and there are some fantastic views and photographic opportunities. Very quiet as end of season ."
"Family of 5 with children aged 13, 11 and 9.  Ok so it's not a day trip but it's worth a visit when mixed into a shopping trip.  Aim to get their before the heat of the day and shop in the shade in the afternoon.It's not a big castle, but pleasant and well kept with great views of the surrounding area.  Being keen to explore I was disappointed to find out that the stairs to the top of the tower was closed off.  Small bits of information on trees and birds as you walk round.  Short enough to stop the kids from getting board.If your a KFC fan then head back through security at the main port. It's similar prices to the UK so expensive for turkeys standards but not an issue if it's what your used to spending.  Oh and there are free clean toilets!!"
Not really worth visiting.  OK for the walk down. Seems to be a favourite place for the local courting couples!!
"This currently not open, you can walk along to it but not go round it. Doesn't look like it is going to be open anytime soon. Looks impressive from what you can see of it."
Take a walk here and if it's open go in; it's free.  There are also reasonably-priced craft vendors along the walkway out to the fortress and you can pick up an evil eye bracelet for cheaper than you will likely see in the rest of Turkey or Kusadasi.
"Went here last year after it was renovated, it has changed a lot, it has a lovely walk around the base of it, kept really clean. The whale skeleton is brilliant. Loads of information boards around, seated areas, in the sun or the shade, well worth a visit.Plenty of pics to be had."
walk along the fortress walls see lovely views and if you don't like height then don't look down lol. take alook around visit the mini markets there or try resturant on path way down there but can be bit pricey though.
"Recovering from surgery and this place was within walking distance with plenty of fish  restaurants close by. It's a lovely place and on the other side  there is a cafe and a sea swimming area with sun loungers and so you can really make a day of it. We did a morning stroll around the castle, my son had a dip in the sea ( I was unable) then there are plenty of 1 hour boat trips that are 15 lira yes £1.50 so plenty to do around the castle if you easily bored or the kids are."
Unfortunately it was still closed but we strolled around anyway. Well worth a visit. Do go next time you are in town.
"Beautiful place and lovely view we were a little disappointed that inside the castle is set up more like a gallery with a whale skeleton, rather than making the most of the structure. Also you can only walk round the ground floor. Apart from this it is free to enter and the gardens are lovely. Takes about 30 minutes tops to go around, but isn't suitable for the disabled and prams."
"Lit up at night so a good place to feel the ambiance, the views over the harbour and back to the town are spectacular. In the day, the principality swimming area behind the cafe is worth a visit, 10tl for a bed and a life guard there all day, deep water but crystal clear and good swimming."
loved it. really beautiful and tells a nice story. An area that ypouy can see again and again. a visit worth
"It was a long walk from Derici Hotel. Don't walk in afternoon to avoid the sun. Its a nice, well maintained, small attraction. Can see in maximum half hour. More like a botanical garden with information about trees and birds. There is a huge whale skeleton. View of the sea from castle is really nice. Very few birds like pigeons, peacock, owl."
"Visited the island in October 2016, it's very easy to get to, just watch along the the small roadway up to the island and up the stairs and enter a very lovely place. The area is littered various trees of olives and other plants, making it quite restful at times. The castle is a sight to behold indeed! Once you enter the building you are confronted by the skeleton of a sperm whale! In the alcoves and in cabinets are models of may ships, ranging from viking to galleons.It's quite enjoyable, you could probably wander around the island and castle within an hour but it's worth it just for the view and watching the sunset.Worth the walk, in my opinion"
"Spotted this island from the cruise ship and decided to take an amble there - walked along this causeway from the main road linking it to the island. Lots of day tours by boats appear to be departing from this causeway judging from the advertisement billboards all along the way.  This was around noon so most boats had already left.  Leaving scattered anglers along the way and I actually saw two of them reeling in their catch - one looked like a healthy size sea bream and the other was a much small one.  On the other side along the causeway were a couple of souvenier stalls selling earrings, hats and wrist bands etc.  Finally reached the Castle only to find out that it has turned into a restaurant which does not open till dinner time!  Such a disappointment.  So I decided to follow the pathway and try walk around the castle on the outside but had to stop halfway and turn around as the pathway had crumbled.  It appeared doable but I was alone and did not want to get into trouble alone scrambling around the rocks.Spotted some people swimming in the beautiful sea - they had clambered down some rocky steps from the pathway and seemed to be enjoy floating around.  But I noted that they were wearing sandals cos I guess you have to clamber up the rocky bits from the sea which may not be kind to your feet....All in all and enjoyable walk in the hot sun so bring your umbrella or cap and put on sunblock!"
"Had some extra time in Kusadasi so we wanted to visit the fortress but when we got out there it was locked up. The fortress looked interesting from the shore and the walk out to it was interesting, but not being able to get in was a disappointment."
Was closed for renovations but the walk around was pleasant! Enjoyed watching fishermen and the boats in the harbor!
"Recommend a visit. Short walk from the central areas with no access charges, well kept gardens and building with a great vista and views over the bay.  Cafe on site along with a number of boat trips from the causeway."
"It’s a great place to walk around. It takes about an hr or so and is free. Watching the sunset from the castle is pretty awesome, although I’d recommend taking a taxi back to your hotel."
For a nice way to spend a couple of hours take a walk out to Birds Island. You can see it from the harbour. Its a nice walkout to it and  a great place for a couple of photographs. Try to find out before if the castle is open as it is worth a visit.
Looks great from the water or from the Kasadasi Pier but as you get closer reality sets in.  The outside still attracts wedding parties for photographs at dusk or early evening when the dark hides the litter.But stick to the wider view!
"Ok, the good news was a taxi driver relieved us of extra dinars & provided a private off the beaten path island tour. See if you can do the same. Nice walk from town"
"ada, name is island. a holly place. kuşadası geting the name from here. the first touristic place in turkey. please especially kuşadası here waiting you"
"Not open. Don't see any work going on. Fortress dominates Kusadasi port and is picturesque, but that's it's only interest"
Very good for a short visit.  Took us about 30 minutes to walk here from our hotel and about 1 hour to walk all around.  Definitely fit it into your schedule as it doesn't take too long and is a nice prelude to a cold beer.
"Our first visit, despite visiting and living in Kusadasi. Walked around the deck area only due to access inside being difficult for us. Lovely vista of Kusadasi from a new perspective. Lots of day cruise ships in dock. Nice cafe area at end of walkway. Can remember the excellent refurbishment from 2012. Lots of people about.And, it's all free. Except the cafe and the boat trips, of course.Well worth a visit.See photos."
In kusadasi town centre way to ladies beach right hand side. Beautiful castle. Can't see in side. But you can trip in garden all around. See the wiev of kusadasi different point. Night time nice too..
I think one of the most famous place to take a photo in Kusadasi. It was quite busy and there was no social distancing. We felt a bit nervous but  was a nice walk. Have an ice cream and start walking after 5pm :)
"Sorry folks... The fortress is closed!! We walked to the Fortress from our Hotel in the center of Kusadasi. Nobody knew in advance that the fortress was closed, and there is no indication on the notice found on the entrance door when it will be open again.But looking on the bright side... It was a nice walk and it gave me a great excuse to sit on the other side of the port to enjoy a nice drink. Really, the view here is great, and by all means worth coming over here. Enjoy watching the locals fish here, listening to the sound of the water while enjoying the scenic view... and then have a nice cool beer / coffee nearby :-)"
"Steep climb to top, with quite a few steps. Best to go before gets too hot.  Not too busy, peaceful and tranquil. Stop off places to sit."
"If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Kusadasi front and town, wander a short distance out of town, past the port to Pigeon Island and this little oasis of calm and beauty. There are a few boats moored up along the causeway, offering 1 hour or longer trips, a few small trinket stalls and a taxi rank - there was no hassling from any of them.Although the site is historic, there has been a lot of renovation work on the castle, walls and walkways. There are quite a few steps and steepish walkways, but it is SO worth the effort. It's also spotlessly clean and well maintained and planted. The views in all directions are wonderful, whether over to Snake Island, Turkish coastline or out to Samos and the Aegean. Even mid day on a Sunday, it wasn't crowded. Allow yourself 45 -60 minutes to really appreciate the feeling of calm and beauty.The most surprising thing is that there's NO ENTRANCE FEE!There's a small coffee bar/cafe just outside the castle walls - we didn't stop there so can't comment on service or price"
