"Are trip was with Karma Kerala, the boat was Mystica Rose. We booked a deluxe boat. The back waters are stunning and we loved that. The boat was awful. The bathroom smelt of sewage which filtered into the bedroom. We complained on many occasions, the staff just poured disinfectant on the floor. The back of the toilet was leaking every time you pulled the flush. We showered for three days in cold water. We were only allowed the air conditioning in our room after nine pm. None of this was acceptable.The general state of the boat was very poor and in need of refurbishment and the standard of cleaning was non existent We had three staff, two staff left the boat each night to go to their homes. We believe the route taken was to accommodate this. On our return I contacted the company but have recieved no reply.  Please check the boat before you leave the dock!"
"A tour of the beautiful backwaters of Kerala is a must!  We chose CGH Earth Spice Coast Cruises & we were so glad that we did.We only had 1 night on the boat but felt like that was enough.  After our hectic trip so far, it was absolutely magic to enjoy the peace & tranquility of the lake & the house boat!  It is such a peaceful way to travel & have a sticky beak at the goings on of life for people that live in this area.We were served a fabulous lunch, dinner & breakfast & the meals were plentiful & super delicious.  I loved this part of our trip!  Make sure you enjoy the Kerala Backwaters on a houseboat - you won't regret it!"
We all enjoyed the slow and laid back boat ride. Cruising through Kerala Backwaters gave us the chance to enjoy nature. It is truly God’s Own Country. 
We stayed at Prasanthy houseboat for one night. The boat ride was altogether a unique experience. The natural beauty of backwaters is a mesmerizing sight to watch. We  set on sail at noon had lunch onboard at sailed till evening. Witnessing sunset while sailing through the…
"We spent a night on Why Not Houseboat in November and couldn’t recommend enough. They have 3 different boats but we booked the premium one. We went down to the ship yard the morning of the trip and it was the nicest boat we saw by far. The guys were easy to deal with a book through. The boat has a top deck which is lovely, a shower, comfy bed, air conditioning. The food was the best we’ve had in Kerala - the chef is fantastic! The only criticism was that for whatever reason the bedroom ceiling was flaking so the bed ended up with sand like particles on it. Annoying when trying to sleep. Seen quite a lot of people saying they’d struggle for two nights but we’re in our 30’s and could have done another day - it’s the most relaxing thing we’ve done on our trip so far."
We enjoyed the 1 nights stay on the Star of Jesus houseboat. Captain Joseph and the Chef were great. We stopped at a market to get fresh prawns which was prepared for our supper. Shower was cold however it was hot so it was acceptable. Clean and neat houseboat. Cruising around was interesting and insightful. We had a 5am check out and the staff helped us get to the car on time and the packed breakfast was appreciated.
"On a Holiday of a lifetime - Cunard Cruise - we stopped at Cochin for one day.  Our 3 hour tour from Alleppey in our houseboat was a wonderful experience.  Drifting through a tangle of lush tropical backwaters we saw kites(the bird) flying above, kingfishers darting below the…"
We went our honeymoon trip with gogeo holidays. They facilitated the best&we enjoyed a lot. Thank u gogeo
"Arranged via Trailfinders, this private overnight trip was a huge success. If you go to Kerala, it surely is a must-do. This company is based in Alappuzha . I suggest making your trip as soon as you can though. Huge numbers of extra boats are being built to increase all the operators' capacity and I fear the waterways may seem less serene in a few years. As it was, we only saw much of other boats at the very start and finish.  We had the whole 2-cabin boat with 3 staff to ourselves, which was amazing. Our cabin was surprisingly roomy for a small boat and beautifully presented with lots of wood in the traditional way. The shower room was more basic but fine. Everything was spotlessly clean. Smaller boats always have to manage water carefully but it was OK. The dining/lounge area was covered but open at the sides and very comfortable. You could see out just as well from the table as from the sofa. Cushions were arranged at he prow for sitting outside comfortably. When we moored for the night it was in a secluded spot, scenic and very quiet. We were warned about mossies, but encountered fewer on the boat than in towns.  All meals were included and of a very high standard. If only we could have finished everything! They are not licensed, but a nice touch was a gift of a bottle of beer and wine with dinner, which the law permits. The staff were attentive, but not too much so, and very happy to make everything perfect for us. While cruising, the driver would point out features and adjust his course to help get good photos. We had a short shore visit to stretch our legs and see a lovely Syrian Christian church and an artist in wood carving at work.…"
"Having enjoyed several Oberoi hotel stays we incorporated a 3 night stay on the Mv Vrinda during our recent 4 week trip of South India. The boat is very comfortable and the accommodation as expected. The boat mores at it's own private jetty every night and each day's excursion starts from there. This inevitably means that there is a lot of repetition in the daily itineraries and we feel that 2 nights would have been sufficient - there was not enough variation to make the 3rd day interesting. Food is a la carte but apart from breakfast there is no menu. Chef will inform what he intends to cook for lunch and dinner and if you are not keen he will make an alternative. I probably expected a slightly more varied choice, but overall the food was good.With hindsight we feel it would have been better to stay in a nice 5* hotel on the Backwaters and done day trips in a small boat that are able to navigate the narrower canals."
Hi I wanted to visit Kerala by 9 to 13 Dec. Excluding flight. From Mumbai. Give details with and without hotels.
"We weren't sure about doing a Backwater cruise but having seen these in documentary's etc we felt it had to be done. Our one bed cabin boat was a very basic converted rice boat but very comfortable. From the moment we boarded our three man crew just spoilt us rotten. We felt like Royalty. After an hour the chef prepared a sumptuous lunch. Simply the best food served to us in all our Indian travels. Snacks appeared later in the afternoon and as the sun started to set we moored on and island reserved for Spice Coast Cruises. Very peaceful with only two other boats nearby. With the sun down we had a quick shower while the crew placed mosquito nets around and set dinner. Another first class meal. So romantic eating by lamplight. After a good nights sleep breakfast was served before making our way back to the quay. Sorry crew, we made a note of your names but lost them. Boat no. 6 sailed on 27th Feb. (Photo attached). You all deserved a mention as you were so wonderful. Thank you. Simply our highlight of a three week tour."
Backwaters boating is an expensive that every visitor to Kerala enjoys. But if you are a vivid photographer and want to enjoy the birds then boating in Kumarakom backwaters is the ride you should not miss. Depending upon the season you may also see migratory birds. Birds…
"Two couples on a former rice barge, with good food and lots to see as we floated the Kerala backwaters.  A fascinating, easy journey -- seeing exotic birds and observing local people as they went about their everyday chores.  It was like watching a travel program on TV, only here we were actually a part of it.  Recommend."
Enjoyed the Kerala tour (Munnar + Alleppey) during last week of Nov thanks to top class arrangement from GoGeo Holidays. The hotel Dreamcatcher with Tea plantation farms in Munnar was truly spectacular surrounded by mountains and greenary. It really catches your dream of staying…
"It was really a great experience to sail through the Backwaters. Nice Quiet Water, Great Views all around,  Good Double-Decker Boat,  Helpful Pilot and Staff. Had a great time."
Looks great in the pictures but up close there is so much rubbish. We actually pulled out of an overnight houseboat trip because of bad management also. Thara's Eco House Boats.  Booked on Booking .com received email with location as well as checked on google maps. Went to that…
"Had a 55ft vessel just for the 3 of us. Over night, was hot on deck but the a/c is turned on in the cabins when you turn in for the night. Having breakfast whilst slowly cruising along was a highlight."
"Hi everyone. I'm Prakaash, a travel agent from Malaysia.- About the Boat Owner and their Service -Actually I reserved the rooms for my clients. As per their statement, the Boat owner was really a down to earth person. He really took a good care of them. They had a homely feeling there. And my personal opinion about him, overall he is a helpful person and very confident in what he is doing.- About the Boat -This place is really awesome and value for money. They well maintained their place as per guest's satisfactions.- Food -It's extremely good and the best ever in Kerala. They are preparing according to guest's requirements.Surely I will consider on appointing them as my panel. Well done guys!! Good job done and, may you keep it up. Thank you."
"Had the best time of my life in Kerala. No wonder it is called 'God's own country'. The coconut groves, lakes, forests...Kerala is simply beautiful. I had gone there a few days back. Had chosen a tour package to Kerala from Dream Holidays. Extremely glad that I did so. Because…"
I did this trip with a few other people from my resort. First of all the amount of plastic in the water is heartbreaking and glass bottles. It’s s nice relaxing way of seeing the backwaters. The boat driver was on his cellphone most of the time. Saw quite a lot of different birds.
You have not seen Kerala until you do this!  Houseboat cruise the backwaters.  Village life.  Natural beauty.  Peaceful.  Book an overnight cruise with a good company.  You will not regret it!
"Fabulous experience and a big shame only one night! Five of us enjoyed our overnight experience cruising around the backwaters. Thoroughly enjoyed seeing people drink, wash themselves and crockery, swim and fish in the waters. Learnt that our experience was the last one due to COVID19 closing down the country.....…"

"This experience was amazing! Two nights on a replica rice barge, travelling through the vast and intricate water ways of Alleppey. Our crew were extremely professional, attentive and intuitive, as well as, knowledgeable and a pleasure to travel to with. All carried out in relative luxury! We had a number of stops along the way, in order to stretch the legs. From a waterside market, to a 1500 year old temple! Our guide on these excursions was Vinu, who was a font of local knowledge, as well as our vessels main sailor!Yoshi was extremely resourceful and whilst expertly anticipating our thirst when returning from trips, with a variety of fruit juices and lassis, he was also quick to get into the water and clear out the propeller when water grass became entangled! Our chef, Lal was fabulous and his food was outstanding! The most exquisite flavours of Indian cuisine I encountered throughout my whole trip in Kerala! Delicious! Thank you to the three of them because they effectively take what is a stunning journey through breathtaking scenery and wildlife, and turn it into something extra special! If you’re in Kerala and not planning to experience the backwaters with Spice Coast Cruises, I implore you to reconsider!"
Visiting Kerala and not experience is backwater will leave you trip incomplete. This must to do when you visit this beautiful place with full of peace and extremely close to nature feeling. There are houseboats as well where you can also enjoy stay in these backwaters overnight.
"we visited during christmas to new year period. it is wonderful. enjoyed boating, beautiful backwater, islands, trees"
"Stayed one night on the houseboat. Although accommodation was basic, it was one of the best experiences ever. The people who looked after us were fantastic. The food was out of this world. We had a wee sing song on the boat and kept the poor staff awake and they were still lovely to us. Highly recommend this amazing experience."
"Always best visiting Kerala,my usuals trips will be Kerala. Filled with nature, everywhere greenery. The best part is house boat. Which is quite expensive but it’s worth riding."
"Stayed With Family and the host Shanthi Lal was super helpful,very friendly staffs,delicious food and the owner was kind enough to arrange us the birthday cake for my daughter and organised a cab for us to travel to kumarakom. Highly Recommended."
"Was with the family in September 2016 and a great experience; the lake, it's surroundings and mainly the food. Here at the Boat House on the Lake you may just relax and enjoy the freshly cooked seafood....oops lake water breed. You may shop for lobsters, fishes crabs sold along the lake. Get the boatmen to cook for free. Do leave them a handsome reward or tips if the cooking is great. Belief me, it's always great. You may purchase coconut water or the local fermented brew or it's local beer the  ""Toddy"". The Back waters is ideal for all group of ages. My parents in their 80's suited well too. One may also hire a small boat to travel along the many villages and homes along the canal. It is indeed true that Kerala is ""GOD's OWN LAND"" and everything in it is paradise."
"Take a smaller boat, try'paddling' yourself! New tastes and sights and all guided by calm interested guides."
"Explore adventure travel provided an excellent tour for my daughter and I in a tropical wonderland. The homestay was excellent, friendly people comfortable accommodation.The food although not my favorite was enjoyed by the others in our party. Drifting along seeing birds palm trees and temples was a peaceful tranquil day and evening"
"Outstanding, amazing, awesome, incredible, you choose your own words.  A trip along the backwaters on to the lake with a well stocked houseboat containing food cooked expertly by your personal chef and a cool box of beer makes your trip along the canals and waterways simply stunning.  Go as a group, impress a loved one or simply go alone and feel like royalty.  This was clearly my highlight of my trip to India.  Simply stunning and very well priced.  Don't even think about it, just find a company, look to pay around 12000 rupees for a good standard boat for two people and let the scenery do the rest."
Enjoyed the nature in entire trip. Nice place and new experience. Food also very nice. Infrastructure too good. Must try this trip.
