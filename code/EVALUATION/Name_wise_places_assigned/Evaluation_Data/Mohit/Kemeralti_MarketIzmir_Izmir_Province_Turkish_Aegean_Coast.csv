"Loads of stalls for clothing, shoes, Jewellery, fish, and anything else you may need. Be careful as there are teams of children out to pick pocket you. Ladies keep your handbags tight, gents leave your watch on the safe and hands on your wallet and phone. Still a busy market and everyone wearing masks which was reassuring. Worth a visit for sure."
"Every visitor should stop here, they have everything - food, clothes, toys, coffee, and more. Gets crowded at times."
"The Bazaar is fascinating, there is like nothing you don't find, but bring time, keep your belongings under control and keep an eye on where you are, else you get lost. Don't mind the people trying to do business with you, stay friendly, buy what you need only :)"
"Oldie market stalls selling anything from clothes, food, souvenirs oh and puppies! Got some bargains there. Bought clothes, scarves & bags. We went early so not too hot and busy. Didn’t cost too much via taxi from hotel either, working out at 50p a mile! Be aware their driving isn’t to UK standard and mobile phones are used constantly whilst driving!Lots of stray cats & dogs too."
A good market with good shops and goods. Buy whatever you need with fair prices and enjoy your travel in Izmir.
"You can find anything here if you look , although it Is easy to get lost.  The shopkeepers are very helpful and just ask which way the sea is and you can navigate yourself out of the maze.  A smaller version of the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul.  Warning it gets very crowded and extremely hot in Summer. A must see."
"Thousands of shops, Amazing variety. Superb restaurants. Can purchase anything and everything. Check your prices before you buy. As Prices vary from shop to shop. Turkish delight is 1/5 of the price of the spice market in Istanbul and just as fresh"
"Open air market  / mall. Must be 500 + stores. From - jewelry, clothing, fresh fruit, meats, fish, nuts, dresses, beads, fabric, books,.... You name it. You definitely can get lost. Keep away of how you entered. There is some nice places to eat and have coffee."
"Kemeralti is a lively, inspiring market where you can find anything you can imagine, from mounds of spices and Lokum to brass mosque fittings. It’s a place to be happily lost for a whole day if you have the time. My friend who is an Izmir native still gets lost in the market, but for visitors and locals, just ask directions and someone will help you find your way. You need to see the karavansaray, the covered market filled with artisans and handicrafts. It’s near the opening facing Konak Pier and the clock tower. Keep left upon entering the market and watch on your right for the arched entrances to the ancient brick building."
A historical bazaar with variety options for mainly silver or authentic jewellery and souvenir. Coffee shop in the middle of the courtyard has very tasty turkish coffee. Ask for mastic gum flavour turkish delight with it ( it is complimentary). Definatelly worth to see if you are  a visiter.
"This is the ""Bazaar"" of the city, where you can find anything and everything and at the cheapest prices. Good for a stroll plus some shopping, especially for high quality edibles like dried fruit, coffee, nuts and spices. If you also like history and an authentic taste of Turkish culture, I think this is a must-visit. Be careful not to ask to take any pictures of the parrot the guy at the center of the bazaar has, you'll end up ripped off for sure!"
"If you love to shop, you’ll love to walk around this market. Be ready to bargin back and forth on price, it’s customary and expected. Lots of fun..."
"This market has so much to see. You will surely get lost and found in the hours you spend there. I am sure one can get a map of sorts but I couldn't find one! There is a lot of locals shopping here as well as tourists. Make sure to negotiate and many are happy to provide discounts on purchasing more than 1 product. There is a mishmash of different items on sale from spices, to leather. Some items in this market are cheaper than in Istanbul. If you going with kids I suggest you be extra careful only because its so busy and chances of getting lost would be high as one can get distracted with the many items on sale. People in the market ae very friendly, a lot speak English and assist with directions or a specific item you looking for."
One of the best place in izmir for shopping. Make sure you are comfortable in your shoes!! A little tip : don't go in a big group. This place is almost crowded everyday..enjoy your shopping :)
"spent almost 2 hour strolling indoor:  saw a lost of shops selling shoes, bags, clothes, scarfs, sweets & nuts and souvenirs.  I prefer the small outdoor shops that sells spices.  Bought a lot of nuts  and spices.  Very, very kind elderly man.  So friendly and kind.  Language is definitely not a problem here:  we are Japanese (family of 4).  Even my normally quiet mother, had a great time 'chatting' with the shop-keeper/owner with gestures."
"This place is quiet big. Baby stuff to wedding dress, everything you look for. And for a 1/3 price of you see in a shopping mall. One end to Alsanchak  to over Izmir museum. Spare around 3-4 hours to walk around. A definite stop if in Izmir."
"You must spend half a daha at that bazaar of İzmir. Do some shopping for your family. Nice souvenirs, türküsü delight or some jewelery :) Must eat something türküsü style like İskender kebap, döner kebap, meat balls or fish at fish market, traditional soups and deserts. Finally drink a cup of turkis coffee at Kızlarağası kervansar."
"Whatever you want and need is in this busy shopping neighborhood. It is a web of multiple shopping streets and neighborhoods. You can easily get lost but it is a good thing because every street will take you to a different adventurous shopping experience. They don't have high end brands and mostly clothing stores but you can find household items as well as foods and groceries as well. Beware of pick pocketing especially on busy weekend day or before the holidays which this place is packed with local shoppers. This is a must see place in Izmir. Food and restaurant selection is great, try to enjoy small restaurants which serves home cooked meals for the workers called ""Esnaf Lokantasi"" ."
"You will like it by all means. Don't forget to go to kizlaragasi han to drink some coffee or lemonade. Walk over the whole kemeralti not only on the main streets, you will find evetything in very good prices. You will love people, they are very friendly and nogle"
"If you visit Izmir, you must visit Kemeralti. The sights, sounds, and smells are a true slice of Turkish life. The numerous streets lined with shops can be confusing, but if you just keep walking, you should be able to find your way back out to the main street. Along the way, you will experience every type of shopping imaginable----leather, carpets, t-shirts, housewares, Turkish delight, tea, spices, cheeses, juices, wedding gowns, toys, souvenirs, etc. If you can't find it here, it does not exist! Make sure to stop at one of the restaurants for doner, and at one of the dessert restaurants for pudding or baklava. Then walk down towards the waterfront for a nice stroll along the harborfront."
Didn't have time to explore the whole place but it is full of shoes and clothes and shoes and clothes and shoes and clothes. Nice place to shop for these items and maybe have a snack but not much else to it.
"Great place for shopping and if you like bargaining it's a shopper paradise. Well worth a visit is the central plaza where there are restaurants and cafes galore. Try the kebab cooked on the open wood fire, it's delicious"
"Its quiet huge market, perfect place for shopping almost every product avaible in the market. keep walking the street you find cafe, restaurant and cloths shop etc."
I used your map directions to go to the Kemeralti Market and they took me to a point about two miles uphill from the market.  Check it out.
"It is a big market, as they call it ""bazar"". You won't escape sellers shouting and inviting you in, but that is the ""shop adververtisement"" in Turkey :) You can buy all kinds of stuff there from food to clothes or some electronic things. You can also eat there, they have very tasty street and cooked food, you should try iskender, drink some tea, sit there in the middle of the noise around. Don't expect clothes to have a very good quality, but oh come on it's only 2 or less euros for some pants or t-shirts. But in places like this you can feel the real Turkey, so go even if you are just looking."
"I would definitely recommend taking a walk through this market if you visit Konak Square. It is big bustling place. Expect lots of attention and people asking you to take a look at their stall. It definitely had a buzz that my husband and I enjoyed. We were informed by a local market seller that it has as much as 14,000 stalls which means we only scratched the surface! Lots of clothing, handbag and jewellery stalls. It also had a number of mosques in the vicinity which can be visited at the right times."
"Many small vendors,  food,  carpets,  local shopping.  Sampling of course.   Near clock tower ( under construction).   Walked around on a rainy day."
Have been there many times. Brilliant for rambling around looking for exotic bargains. A must for tourists. Also many places for eating and coffee.
"Something for everyoneI could spend days here!Easy to get lost in the many alleys, but that just adds to the fun. Take an empty bag or two, you'll surely need it!"
"It was great to see the market- hustle and bustle was really busy. Local produce and the fish market was amazing. We picked out some right clothes bargains at a very busy shop. Seeing as clothes from Zara are made in turkey, my Partner was pleased with the quality. Picked up great Disney stuff for my niece. It was too hot for me to take my phone out only managed a few snaps."
"The best market that i had the opportunity to visit.Imagine a huge place with lots of tight streets, selling all kinds of stuff. From food to gold.It's a unique experience walk around the whole market. Take one entire day there, and you will not be able to see everything!Very good deals! I recommend to negotiate with the vendors! They always have additional discount, but most part of the shops does not accept credit cards, and the best prices are always in cash.There are some cash exchange places there if you don't have Turkish Lyra."
"Be carefull for not loose your way :) This is historical old bazaar of Izmir, just possible visit by walk. You can buy whatever you want... All kind wearing, shooes, meals, jewelery, gold, meat, spices, salamur, pet (cat, dog,fish,bird), you can find butcher, greengrocer, candies, have lunch, smoke, have meals, coffee, flower.... Whatever you need you can find at Kemeralti. There is one main street and several secondaries, you may loose yor way :) if you do, try to follow up the way that most of the people go. It might not easy to turn back at same way :)) it would be easy if you use mobile maps... There would be too many people even if its weekday. At weekend, you may feel yourself like leave a football match or concert, people would be flow like a river. İf you have child, be careful for not loose each other ;) generally the prices might be evaluate as cheap for most of the comodities. How many hours you can spend there? 1 day is not enough to ser everywhere. Even if it's a historical bazaar, most of the buildings are not old or not restored very well. Please do not imagine to walk in a amazing historical buildings... Enjoy your trip..."
Forget Marmaris or Kuşadası bargains are here!!! From wedding dresses to designer t shirts. From socks to shoes they have it all!! You can still hustle on price and yes walking away and find somewhere. Worth a visit ignore holiday reps they probably would say otherwise.
"Went to the "" famed"" Kemeralti bazaar expecting something a bit like the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul..but boy was I mistaken!Yes, there are streets and alleyways crammed with any and every type of ( cheap) clothing,leather goods, "" jewellry"", ceramics, kitchenware, wedding outfits, mobile phone covers, nuts, spices, soaps, fish mongers and kebap shops, but there is no real charm to the place, and it all seems like just a big outlet for whatever China can't sell at home. Oh yes..and it is also where you can buy imitation designer goods for a pittance. My wife and I made the mistake of stopping into a leather bag shop, where the owner "" Ali"" proudly showed us his wonderful selection of high-quality, ""best-priced"" ""designer"" ( Gucci, YSL, Michael Ford..) hand bags which he made himself. Around the corner were fake Rolex  and Lady Longines watches ..If you have an afternoon to kill, don't mind spending money on imitation goods, or bargaining with the seasoned stall owners, being plied with tea, called "" my friend"" by every stranger wishing to take your money, or being relentlessly pursued by every purveyor trying every trick including guilt to get you to buy something..anything..just name it!, then this is certainly the place to do all that. But, honestly, I would much prefer to shop from reputable dealers on the high-streets where they have price tags and warranties. But the cheap eats were defnitely tasty, hearty, filling and..well..cheap!"
Very busy and not ideal to attend when the sun is at its peak. Should definitely negotiate prices on everythinggg. Loved the little stores selling jewellery. Also stopped by a little cafe and enjoyed homemade lemonade.
