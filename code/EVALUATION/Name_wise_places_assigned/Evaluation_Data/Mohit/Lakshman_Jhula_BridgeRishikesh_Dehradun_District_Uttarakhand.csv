The old construction is still intact. Feels thrilling when on this jhulla. If you hear heights then you must visit this place as it will make you feel safe even in this much height. Try it.
Spotted a Crocodile below the Lakshman Jhula. Very shocked on how safe it is to take dip in Holy Ganga.
Only bridge that cross the magnificent Ganga river unless you walk down 40 mins down to Ram Jhula. Plenty of cafes and shops. Make sure you are not holding or eating foods. The monkeys will take them from you. Very aggressive monkeys.
Place around laxman jhula is happening.. Try to stay in Tapovan if traveling solo or with friends...
3 km from ram juhla and you can get a share auto. Beware you have to walk a long with more ups and downs which need stemina. Better engage a car or auto with up and down. One shiv temple with 20 feet Linga is good place in this place which is also called as tapovan. Since the age of the bridge is high and weak Government has withdrawn people walking in the bridge. However people are walking in the bridge. Beware of monkeys. Again you can have a nice view of Ganga on both side.
"You need to visit it to experience the view. Joins the two banks of river Ganges and is hanging bridge. We did a morning walk here at 6.30am and it was windy, cold but mesmerizing."
"Walking in the market at Rishikesh and crossing this historical bridge is a must for any traveler. It is a colorful, vibrant, buzzing and friendly atmosphere. Clothing is cheap but you must learn or know how to bargain... SASSTA is the word to remember. Alot of unique products and services available."
laxman jhula is a must visit if you go to rishikesh. standing in the middle of bridge in evening when the wind blow at super fast speed is an experience itself
A pool is made many decades back with interesting mythological story of god Ram. Beware of monkeys there if you carry food with you they will literally attack on you to get the food.
"Situated nearby Ram jhula, this bridge is small when compared with the ram jhula. Looks amazing when lit up in the night."
"Crossing Laxman Jhula was an experience in itself .At daytime it would be busier with the traffic of two wheelers taking around 2-3mins to cross the jhula & at night time with little or no traffic, it would take less than a minute. But every time it was both fun and scary especially at night with the cool wind blowing and sound of the gushing Ganges beneath the jhula making the experience a lot more spooky !!"
"Regardless the travel/sightseeing plans, one will not pass Lakshman Jhula while in Rishikesh and probably won't even coubt multiple crossings of this busy iconic bridge that connects Tapovan area with the other side of Ganges adorned by numerous temples, shops and eateries. Enjoy the stunning views and watch out the cheeky monkies waiting to take a hold of your snacks faster than you think!"
the bridge to cross the river with mythological values. Gets a bit crowdy during Aarti time in the evening.
"Lakshman Jhula is beautiful! Have been there several times. There is a lot happening there: satsangs, ayurveda, charity work, rafting, trekking, yoga, courses, wonderful places to eat, temples, shopping, bookshops, places to stay  .....  and of course the Ganga is there and the river banks are very nice, also sandy. There is a lot of variety. Lots of tourists as well as Nepalese are there. But, be prepared for the crowd, scooter, noise etc.. there are also plenty of monkeys ... and at times cows on the bridge. It is also easy to walk from Lakshman Jhula to Ramjhula or take a taxi or a bus to Rishikesh, Haridwar and so on."
Must visit if in Rishikesh. Many cafes to sit and admire the bridge and the view. India in all its wonder and colour pass through here. Be careful when crossing of motorbikes and monkeys. Lovely places to visit on both sides of the bridge.
"Highly recommend Lakshman Jhula at 1AM where it is moon lit , no people , chill in the air and you are right in the middle on the Ganges . Just a quite walk on the bridge with an environment like this is surely to give you an experience which is out of the world ""literally"" . The closest you can come to divine intervention . We just happened to reach at that time by pure luck , but that experience stole the show . This very place is full of people during the day which makes it very ordinary but the experience at night just transforms the place . Enjoy the clear sky , night full of stars the moon light the chill in the air and of course the Ganges ...."
"The bridge itself is an experience. By night is beautifully lit. The bridge gets very busy around 5ish due to all the locals rushing to get temple. Bikes, people, animals all cross this bridge in droves. Be prepared if your white and a woman to expect lots of locals taking photos."
"Go for the area, Ganges view, monkeys, and nearby temple famous temple. The bridge itself is busy and not very special."
"This Bridge which is one of two spanning the River Ganges in Rishikesh is located on the ‘upstream’ side.  Constructed in 1929 at the location where it is said that the deity Lakshman used ropes to cross, it was intended for vehicles and pedestrians. The vehicles could only be of the 2 wheel type as it is a mere 2M/6ft in width. There is no fee to cross the Bridge as I understand it , the replacement was paid for substantially by a wealthy person in honour of his father and that was the conditional payment. Today I also learnt that the gate at either end now prevents the ubiquitous cows we see everywhere, but in the fields, and the Scooters from crossing this Bridge. It is now a fully Pedestrian Bridge.  Interesting but I also noticed an absence of monkeys.  The Bridge certainly provides a great opportunity to take pictures, both upstream and downstream. Unlike other visits I have made here, the Holy River is brown and Very Fast Moving, due to the unseasonably wet weather"
There is a stony pebbles beach had a bath here in morning. Felt the most peaceful ever in cold Ganges water.
It's a well made foot bridge. 2 wheelers do travel on this hanging bridge along with passersby. At night it is well lit and very attractive. Has a lot of eat outs and cafes along side.
"Especially the Tapovan area is beautiful and peaceful, both Lakshman Jhula and Ram Jhula are spectacular and give a great view and feel of the almighty Ganga flowing so peacefully. You should try the short boating trip on the Ganga river from next to Ram Jhula. Try the confectionery cafe next to at the start of Lakshman Jhula and a spectacular view of Ganga Banks from its balcony. Enjoy the local markets in the Tapovan area. Rishikesh is much more cleaner than Haridwar, but highly disappointed at the Rishikesh Triveni Ghat which - not well maintained. Go the brief is - Tapovan Rishikesh is the only place worth visiting and spending good time here while the Haridwar Arti is the best at appx. 5.30 pm onwards daily."
"the most iconic place in rishikesh the famed laxman jula has a lot of feeling for all travellers & tourists comming to rishikesh , the locals use this bridge for commuting & is open to bikes, cycles, scooters & the the locals give you an impression that the bridge is solely  made for their exclusive use and the tourists who walk up this suspension bridge are intruders, the locals a re very rude , harsh , inconsiderate & thankfully the bridge has weakened to a level that the govt. had closed down the iconic bridge to make a new one, hope they make a separate lane for the rude local bikers."
Explored Lakshman Jhula via the scenic route. Our hotel had organised a nature walk early in the morning. The chill in the wind and the rising sun mad a very heady atmosphere for our nature walk. Loved every moment of it and certainly enjoyed the Lakshman Jhula walk. Very few people on the Jhula which was a very pleasant sight. Thoroughly enjoyed the walk. Everyone should go for this experience.
We really enjoyed walking through the jula. We are disappointed that numerous scooters and motorcycles have made this their highway. They have not patience and demand right of way. This needs to stop. Noticed a mother and child walking across the jula and scooters demanding they move. There was no place to move as it was very busy Also think that scooters are being used ad taxis to ferry people across.
"There are three areas in Rishikesh – downtown, virtually all local people, Ram Jhula and Lakshman Jhula.  I saw far more Westerners in Lakshman Jhula Than in town or on the Sivananda side of Ram Jhula.  It is very accessible, scenic, comfortable and fun. Have a lunch at the divine Ganga hotel and take the elevator down To the river."
"The night view of Laxman Jhula on the chilly dark night was beautiful. We spent around 15-20 minutes and walked back to the room.  During daylight, both Ram Jhula and Laxman Jhula was very crowded and took time to cross. Taking photographs amidst the crowd was also a challenge. But, the green coloured Ganges flowing beneath makes it most pleasant to see from a height. We spent around 10 minutes in Laxman Jhula."
"Lakshman Jhula is a incredible place to visit in Rishikesh area. Surrounded by the foothills of the Himalayas. Unique Spiritual atmosphere with the mystical Ganga river. Many options for accommodation around the area, as well as yoga courses, meditation and more."
Take a walk on this bridge to experience the view on both sides and the Ganga river below. The other parallel bridge is Ram Jhula which is about 2Km away.
Guest had food consultation and dined after that. Food was sumptuous as per the guest. Thank you for dining with us.

And people are free and in their own world.For shopaholics this Paradise. Please bargain you can do it unless you are too generous.You have many restaurants (veg) facing the Ganges and some Psy music to chill with. Be there to experience it.CheersShilpa
You will enjoy the views in early morning. At all other times is very crowded. keep small kids in your control during wee hours.
"I stayed in Tapovan, within walking distance to Laxman Jhula, for panchakarma at Maharishi Ayurveda. I enjoyed the ease of walking. Took a while to get used to the street etiquette. If you walk on the left side, let the cows do whatever they want, and have ear plugs for all the honking, the walks are enjoyable."
"Enjoyed walking across this bridge over the Ganga River. So calm, peaceful and fresh air. not very crowded during the time we went. Took 20-30 mins to walk across and walk back"
"This Jhula is the most iconic bridge of Rishikesh. Though it is smaller than Ram Jhula, but it gives an amazing view of the nearby mountains. Go there for a morning walk or late night walkTip : Go there before 6.30 am. Trust me , you ll have a completely difference experience - Breezing winds and zero crowd."
