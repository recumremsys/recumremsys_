"My trip on 5th june 2019 was the 5th attempt at going to kedarnath temple. My wife & I flew into to Dehradun  and stayed at Paramarth ashram at Rishikesh on banks of ganges, beautiful location.The room at ashram was AC & functional, meal at canteen as per choice.Next morning by car to Guptakashi, 9 hrs drive through mostly terrible roads, backbreaking and dusty(road repair) thru magnificent scenery.Stayed at Himalayan comfort,at too high a price for the bare amenities.Next day by helicopter to & fro same day. Very hot weather all through except at Guptakashi. Extreme rush at temple. Considering our heart felt desire for long to complete the 12 Jyotirlingams, this was a happy culmination of that wish.The scenery around the temple of the mountains with some parts covered with snow was a worthy sight.Bought some prasad to take home, took many pictures of the scene, and went back to helibase for return. Contrary to general apprehension of the weather suddenly turning bad for helicopter movement, on the day of our visit it was very bright sunshine the whole day for all onward and return heli trips. On the onward journey by heli the setup was organised well and there was a system. The return from Kedar helibase was quite confusing with no one telling us to register again at the respective aviation company tent. There was a guy at the helipad who was registering for return as we landed, who was not the guy who looked after the return. No announcements of what to do. After you register for return at the right place, they will call out all around the rest places at the helibase. Till then no prior info of when one can expect to take off unless you chase the guys for info. At the Kedar helibase as it was becoming evening, the temperature began to drop and everyone had to use heavy woolens and windcheaters etc After landing back at starting helipad, back again by car all the way back thru same roads with a overnight halts at a place called Srinagar and then at Dehradun, before flying to Bombay."
"I was there in Kedarnath on 21 May along with my wife. This is a must visit temple for Hindus, and the roads nowadays are very good, though a few places on high mountains, the road trip does appear scary. We started from Bangalore on 19 May Jet airways flight at 5.45pm, reached New Delhi at 9pm, took a prepaid taxi to New Delhi Rly Station and reached there well in time for our Nanda Devi AC express to start at 11.50pm to reach Haridwar at 4.30am. We had booked taxi from a local taxi operator (Gangotri Travels) in advance, and had asked him to pick us up at 5.30am, but due to a landslide near Badrinath previous evening, he could not get us Innova as booked by us, instead gave us Dezire at 8am. It was 10 hours journey through mountains and we reached Rampur at 6pm where we stayed in a hotel arranged by Gangotri Travels. On the way around 3pm, we could take our biometric visitors card at a place called Agastyamuni. This card is important, because the Helicopter company will insist on our personal ID such as Aadhar, etc and this biometric card. Medical examination is not a must but they only advise the pilgrims beyond 55 to have one in our own interest. Next day morning, we started for Sitapur Helipad at 5am, reached the helipad at 5.30am, and were able to get the second trip of this helicopter company (Global) at 7.10am. Reached Kedarnath at 7.20am. Since we had taken a special darshan ticket (cost Rs 2100) at the helipad itself, we could complete the darshan of Lord well before 8.30am, the time given by Global to report back for return trip. However, they could take us back only at 12 noon as they take lot of breaks. Once in Sitapur/Rampur, we started our next leg of the tour to Joshimath around 12.30pm, and could reach Joshimath only at 8pm. The cab drive from Rampur/Guptakashi to Joshimath via Ukhimath is a wonderful sight to see around. Rest of our trip is given under Badrinath. Briefly: Day 1 - Reached Haridwar Rly Stn, started to Rampur via Rudraprayag/Agasthyamuni/Guptakashi and reached Rampur. Stay at Hotel Kedar Palace.Day 2 - Started to Sitapur Helipad at 5am, reached there at 5.30am, took Global helicopter (we had booked the tickets one month in advance from Gangotri Travels) at 7.20am, reached back after Darshan by 12 noon at Sitapur, started for Joshimath, reached at 8pm. Stay at Hotel (New Kamet booked by me through Yatra.com).Day 3 - Started at 9am to Badrinath, reached  Hotel Krishna Palance (booked by Gangotri) at 11.30am, luckily got darshan through queue at 2pm, booked tickets for special darshan that evening and also next day morning.Day 4 - Darshan in the morning and started for Rudraprayag at 11am. Stay at Hotel Mandakini (booked by me through Yatra.com).Day 5 - Started from Rudraprayag at 9am, and covered Lakshnan Jula, Ram Jula, Gita Mandir in Rishikesh, and Har ki pauri/Ganga Aarti at Haridwar, and got dropped at Rly Stn at 9pm."
"I visited Kedarnath on 26th May 2018.I would like to share few points with.       Though we booked Chardham trip through SOTC,the operator did not give us details of our Helicopter tickets before hand.Hence faced the following difficulties.    Our hotel was 24 KM away from helipad. Which is a long distance keeping in mind the mountainous area.There was a helipad next to our hotel but that was not booked.   Day before the Kedarnath trip when we asked for tickets we were told to go to helipad by 9 AM. We had same day return promised by SOTC. We approached the helipad staff several times asking them to send us as soon as possible. They issued our boarding passes at 3 P M. After 1 hour break we flew only at 430 PM. Could make it to the temple by 5 PM only. Also we purchased Rs 2500/ special VIP darshan tickets at helipad in which Rs 400/ prasad was included.despite our VIP darshan tickets we were asked to go to some counter to make some entry. Gained darshan only at 530 PM that too only for a split second as we joined the  general queue. Could not touch the Lord .   Also while entering the temple security guard tore our darshan tickets into two pieces. When approached the authorities for prasad he asked us to get the remaining part of the torn ticket. When approached the security guard he said he threw away the other half of the ticket. The staff at the counter refused giving prasad to us despite explaining to them that we purchased VIP darshan tickets at helipad spending Rs 10000/- for 4 people. We showed him the leftover ticket we had in which 4 X pax was mentioned along with word special VIP darshan. Also due to the bungling of our tour operator in arranging helicopter tickets we had to stay back at Kedarnath that night making our own arrangements.The temperature was -1 degrees.   Despite all this we really enjoyed the beauty of Kedarnath early in the morning and returned back. Please keep the above points in arranging things at Kedarnath and do not believe your travel agent blindly"
"Five of us all Mid fifties planned to trek Pancha Kedar and the visit Badrinath to complete the trip. Trek and Temple was theme. We flew from Blore to Delhi, train to Haridwar and Car Xylo to Gauri Kund. For folks doing it for the first time, keep in mind the distance is not 14 km its more like 18-20 km. For us city folks every KM seemed like 5 KM. Half the stretch is well cemented and second half is poor and rain and horses make it worse. Take your time daylight is there till about 8 pm.We planned to start after a dip at Gauri Kund, this was a disaster there is about teaspoon of water we ended having bath under a tap. Buy yourself a rain coat in case you are not carrying one, 20/- one will serve the purpose for the day. It will also cover your backpack.If you are a group with baggage, think about hiring a horse to carry your baggage 1500 will be the cost. They may say you have rent horses in pairs ..ask around you will find a single horse guy. In other places  say Madmaheswar or Rudranath you have to hire in pairs.You need not worry about refreshments there are 2 places every step.TRhe better place to stay at Kedarnath is GMNV guest house. Food at their restaurant is bland and expensive, you can eat at opposite huts or closer to temple."
"We have visited Kedarnath on 20th May 2016, Which was third destination of our Char Dham Yatra after Yamunotri and Gangotri. We were group of 12 with youngest at 2 years and elder of 61.Sonprayag was place where you can book pony so we have decided to start journey from there but as It was peak season, most hotels in Sonprayag were full and rest demanding unreasonable price so we went to Sitapur and stay there for night and reached Sonprayag early at 3am so that we can book pony.After reaching Sonprayag we join the queue for Pony Booking Counter which opens at 5, You have to produce license of Pony Holder when you book Pony, so standing in line early is not guarantee for you to get Pony. You have to negotiate with License Holder to get License from him and Book Pony. You can also book Pony from Gaurikund but you have to Reach there Early as from Sonprayag you can start for Gaurikund after 6.00am. For Palkhi you have to book it from Gaurikund, So Staying overnight and start Journey from here in Morning is Good Option, but for that you have to Reach Sonprayag ill late evening as after 9.00pm travelling from Sonprayag to Gaurikund is not allowed. After Getting license and booking Pony we have travelled from Sonprayag to Gaurikund via Local Vehicle (Rs. 20 per Person) and Start Wonderful Journey from Gaurikund on Pony.The new route is about 18 to 20km. Jungle, Slope, Slant, Bridges, Fog, Rain, River, Waterfall and Snow, Not in particular order, but it's Beautiful. It took 5 hours to reach us Kedarnath and after 1 km walk we have reached temple at 1.00pm. After 2 hr wait in queue we had very good Darshan and Start Return Journey.No Network after Sonprayag so either get local SIM or keep your mobile switched off. Do not rely on any network as it's not totally dependable.If you want to return on same day start very early and book return Pony.If it's late you can stay at camp which is on the way. Don't travel after 6.00 pm.For Helicopter ride book in advance and keep buffer of 1-2 days as service get affected if weather is not good.For Pony Booking use your negotiation skill or get ready to spend double of Government Rate. Limited number of Pony available at the time we visited, so If you get late you won't get Pony or Palkhi."
"A supreme adobe of peace in Badrinath. We have visited on 8th Oct 2019, due to road block at Rambagad, we had 4-5 hours late and reached dham at 11:40AM. Had darshan before 12:30PM as the temple is closed from 12:30PM to 3:30PM. Temple had provided prasad(Rice, Dal and Yellow rice) and that was divine."
"Blessed....I did my helicopter booking from Himalayan Heli services in month of may.We started on 4th May 2018. 1. Left from Haridwar and did my biometric pass which is mandatory for Darshan. 2. Reached Rudraprayag which took us almost 6 hours. Took a halt.3.Started to leave for Sersi from where I had my helicopter booked for Kedarnathji.4. 8 mins to Kedarnathji from our helipad.5.

IMP notesPre book helicopter and staying arrangements.Be ready for rain and very low temperatures as low as 10 to 5 degrees.Carry nuts , snacks etc as the food options are ok.Regards Tarun Samvedi Virar Mumbai"
"Kedarnath is one of the 12 jyotirlinga temples.We visited this Temple last week while our dodham yatra. We visited this temple by helicopter, We missied our 2 helicopter rides because of technical problems in helicopter finally our third attempt was successful. Had wonderful darshan. We put Ghee on Shivling and did abhishekam with water.  The weather was minute by minute changing.  And 4 members in  our group held up there for return trip for helicopter.  Finally, they came back by horses to Gourikund and from there they take Taxi for Sornaprayag.   So, mentally prepare for everything to have Kedar JI darshan.  In Badrinath we had Vishnu Sahasranamavali Darshan for Rs.901/- for 2 persons.  It was very nice experience.  Our vehicle will go near to the temple so not much problem,  This Place is called Bhoo Vaikuntam.  Very auspicious place on the earth.  Lord Vishnu himself come to this place to do Dhyan.  If you do One mala it will count to 10000 mala here.  We booked our dodham package through SHUB YATRA TRAVELS, Rishikesh.  They are very helpful and kind enough in all aspects. Thanks to God for giving great darshan experience in both the places."
"Visited Kedarnath Temple on 16.06.2015. Took the Pawan Hans Helicopter from Phata at 12 pm. It costs 7000 for a return ticket and flight duration is about 7 minutes. The moment you step out, something magical takes over. As you walk towards the Temple (less than 1 km), the dome becomes visible. Once inside, it is hard to describe the experience. Do not forget to see the ""Divyashila"" (Holy Rock) that saved the Temple in the 2013 disaster. Only divinity can be the answer as to how such a rock got stuck just behind the temple in all the fury and saved the temple. Had lunch being served by NAM. Very hygienic, tasty and economical at Rs. 70 per person. Took the chopper back and was in Phata at 3 pm. All in all, a truly amazing anf life changing 3 hours. KUDOS TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR YATRIS. Put this in your bucket list for 2016, if not in 2015."
"First visit to Kedarnath, such a mesmarising experience. We have very good darshan of bhole bath. Want to visit again."
"I and my mother aged 78 went for Gangothri, Kedarnath Ji and Badrinath Ji pilgrimage.  I decided to skip Yamunothri for 2 reasons - 1) I felt it is a long trip adding two days to my trip duration 2) there was a trek at the end of it that is strenuous for mom 3) I felt there isn't enough religious significance (strictly my opinion).  Hence, our trip was to visit three Dhams only.  The length of the trip was 8 days door to door, I had added a buffer day in case of weather / other factors.  We started on 17th of September and were to return on 24th.Day 1: 1150 Jet flight from Mumbai direct to Dehradun, arrival at 1410.  Flight was excellent and on time.The cab driver was waiting for us.  I had specifically asked for a reasonably new Innova basis my previous experience in mountain roads.  We started from airport at 3 pm and the goal was to reach Uttarkashi by dinner time. We took a route via Mussorie and it was beautiful all along.  We got clouds and mist for company once we crossed Mussorie.  We stopped for coffee at 5 pm and crossed Uttarkashi by 8.30. I had booked at a small hotel called Ananda Ganga at Netala, on the main road to Gangothri.  It was right by Ganga and set very nicely.  We were the only residents that night.  Krishnaji who owns the place had arranged for a nice meal and his nephew Praveen was the caretaker.  We reached the hotel by 9 and had a nice dinner.  It was absolutely peaceful with only Ganga's roar for company.  It was mildly cold (20 degrees). The room was on the first floor and comfortable.  We slept peacefully by 10.Day 2: GangothriWe started at 6.30 after a cup of coffee.  The drive was even better with Ganga for company through out.  The road was okay for the most part, some bad patches thanks to landslides (it is very common during rains, not to panic) and flowing water.  We reached Gangnani at 8 AM. There is a Hot spring here and it is customary to take a dip in this pool before proceeding to Gangothri.  We did and it was amazing.  Water was hot and incredible.  There is a small temple here and after spending about half an hour, we continued to Gangothri. We stopped for breakfast at a small dhaba - the guy made special alu paratha for mom (no onion, garlic etc plus no masala).  One learning was to carry some breakfast with us, as the food joints in this sector are average and could be problematic for strict customers like my mother.  Eventually, we reached Gangothri by 11.  We went straight to the river (a 10 minutes easy walk) and was approached by pandas for Pooja / Tharpanam etc. The river is beautiful, fast flowing and muddy thanks to the rains.  We got down and washed our feet and face, felt awesome!  Then we settled down for a tharpanam and Pooja. It was nicely done, gave the pandit a handsome dakshina and proceeded to the temple. After Darshan of various moorthis, it was time to leave. Btw, there is a trek to Gaumukh, 18kms and I didn't go for it.  Had a quick lunch of rotis and daal / curd, plenty of options there.  We left at 1 pm and reached hotel by 4.30.I couldn't resist going for a quick walk around the place - it was incredibly beautiful.  A suspension bridge across the river took me to the other side of the river and I walked around through the village and forest for an hour.  After coming back, sat down by the river for some time.  Great place to meditate, maybe next time!  The water was nice and cold and I thought about a quick dip, better sense prevailed!Krishnaji came around evening and we chatted about the place, temples etc.  He has built his hotel as a retreat and he lets out selectively to keep the serenity intact.  There is a nice Yoga room and he runs courses in summer.After another simple, tasty dinner, we called it a day and went to bed hearing Ganga in the background. Day 3: Guptkashi, en route TO Kedarnath Ji.Again, we started by 6.45.  Praveen packed alu parathas for us.  We went to Uttarkashi Viswanath temple.  A nice temple like the Kashi Viswanatha temple.It was going to be a long drive.  Stopped a couple of times for coffee and then lunch.  The ride was brilliant!  Reached Guptkashi by 4 pm, checked in to Kailash Residency, close to Phata.Two things here: 1) I had decided that we will go helicopter to Kedarnath Ji. After research, booked on Pawan Hans on their web site.  Since morning weather tends to be better in mountains, (my own theory, basis experiences in Leh and Kedar Kantha before) I had booked 7 AM up and 10.30 AM down. 2) I had booked hotels only for the first stop as I was not sure about exactly where we will reach every evening due to possible weather / road issues.  This turned out well as I could choose hotels; September is not peak season and hence I could find plenty of options.So decided to stay close to Phata, the helipad spot.  Kailash hotel was decent - right by the road, nice and clean and excellent service.  Food was really good and mom enjoyed the food.  Everything as advertised!Evening, went to the Guptkashi temple.  An old, small temple having Viswanath Ji and Ardhanareeswarar idols.  There was a small Ganga Jamuna stream in front.  Overall, good to see if one has time.After a nice dinner, retired early.  Excitement was building for next day visit to Kedarnath Ji.Day 4: Kedarnath Ji, absolutely mind blowing!So we started early by 5.45, reaching Phata by 6.15. Reporting time for the 7 AM trip was supposed to be 6 AM and there was no one!  The friendly tea vendor asked to give a call and soon someone showed up.  He goes like ""our helicopter has some technical issues, hence we are putting you on another company's helicopter"". Sounds familiar?  No point in getting worked up, so plan B it is.  UTAir was right next door (there are at least 5-6 operators around Guptkashi) and we were taken there.  The crew seemed reasonably professional and things moved forward quickly.  There was a large Tamil group who had booked ahead of us and they left in groups of 5-6 depending on weight of the passengers.  Our turn came at 7.45.  (The helipad waiting room feels like a bus stand actually, with a stinky toilet to boot!)After a quick security check etc, we boarded the helicopter. There were going to be 6 of us plus the pilot. I was in the front seat and mom in the back.  She could get in without too much trouble and soon were up and away!I had done a helicopter trip many years back in New Zealand.  Mom was a little tense.  However, the ride was perfect, the weather was clear and sunny.  No bumps, even better than a flight take off.  After a 8 minute ride over the trees and hills, we landed in Kedarnath helipad.It was a little more cold than Phata, must have been around 15.  No winds though.  We walked up to the shrine, plenty of porters with a chair on their back offering to help (what all man needs to do earn a living!), but mom walked slowly and steadily.  I kept reminding her to walk slowly and stop every few steps as oxygen levels are lower up there.  Panda time again and I thwarted them off.  The place is incredibly beautiful with the peaks in the back.  However,  there are signs of 2013 devastation still around and construction is on for camps etc.  The temple looked beautiful.  I eventually engaged a panda who appeared less pushy.  He asked me to buy a few things - some stuff for prasad, ghee, honey, milk, bhasmam, chandanam etc.  I got the first two only as I was not sure what to expect.  We went in and what strikes is the sheer size of the lingam and the unusual shape (like the hump of a bull).  The lingam must be 2-3 feet across and 2 feet tall.  We waited next to it for a good 15 mins for our turn.  Then our panda asked us to sit next to the lingam and started the Pooja.  It was incredible to be this close to a Jyotirlingam and then eventually smear Ghee with own hands.  We spent a good 15 mins doing the Pooja and we were overwhelmed to say the least!  Rest of the details are a blur!  Next time (if there is one), should definitely carry all the stuff the panda recommended.We came out by 9.15 and after some coffee and packed parathas, boarded the return helicopter.  Again the ride was awesome and we were down in Phata by 10.15! Our driver couldn't believe it!! I guess we were lucky that every thing went smoothly.We got back to hotel and took rest for some time.  Post a nice lunch, it was time to pack up and proceed to Badrinath Ji!We made a quick de-tour to visit Kalimath, a siddha peed.  It was quite a rough ride of about 10 kms and the temple was empty.  We were about to move out when a priest came and we did a quick Pooja. It was a tantric place and felt different - could feel the vibrations though! Hindsight : could have avoided this detour.Post Kalimath, time to push towards Badrinath Ji.  The aim was to ride for 4-5 hours and stay en route, maybe in Joshimath.The route we took was incredibly beautiful via Ukhimath / Chopta / Chamoli.  The rolling meadows of Chopta followed by dense forests of Mandal were absolutely mesmerising.  The sky was cloudy by now and it started raining heavily - we rode in dense forest with poor visibility for 45 minutes.  Two big Sambhars crossed ahead of us as a special treat!  Finally we got out of the forest by 5.30 pm as the light was going down.  The driver was thankful that no tree fell down and blocked the way!We made upto Pipalkoti and decided to stop for the day as the time was 7.30 and all of us were tired.  After looking around for a while, stayed at Uday Palace hotel.  It was an old hotel that had seen better times.  However, the room was clean enough and basics in place.  I wouldn't recommend this place though!Next morning started by 7 am.  Reached Joshimath by 8.30.  Went to Narasimha temple first - what chaitanyam! No wonder as we learned that the idols were installed and worshipped by none other than Adi Shankaracharya.  Above the temple, there is a small room where a statue of Adi Shakanra is installed, he attained Gyanam here.  You could feel a powerful presence in this temple for sure.  There are a couple more small temples around here, definitely worth visiting.  We then crossed the road and went to Shankara Mutt out of curiosity.  A young boy came and gave us a description of the entire place.  Apparently the pontiff doesn't sit here, he visits once in a while.  There is a nice temple with a beautiful Sphatika lingam.  The young student was so happy that we're from Kerala, the land of Shankara, that he went out of the way to engage us.We left by 9 and stopped at Nandaprayag.  There is nice temple at the confluence of Dhuli Ganga and Nandakini.  We had some light breakfast there and proceeded.  The route was becoming incredibly beautiful with Alakananda running by side and beautiful peaks around. The road is tricky though with plenty of bad patches and the possibility of landslides.  We stopped at Pandavkar on the way.  It is a short trek only.  The temples are small but beautiful and have Badrinarayanan idol.  This whole place has strong linkage to Pandavas, either during their ajnathavasam or vanaprastham.  The climb back a little strenuous for mom as air was a little low on oxygen.  We made it to Badrinath by 1 pm.  Hindsight : could be avoided as mom struggled to climb back.Badrinath seemed to be a bustling town.  We realised that it it going to be crowded as a Jeer was visiting next day and his followers have descended in plenty. It was Pithrupaksha also, and for whatever reasons, plenty of Telugu folks had come down too.  I enquired at Dwarkesh hotel and it was full.  Next up was Snow Crest and luckily we got the last room available - moral of the story, book early at Badrinath as supply is limited.  There are plenty of Dharmshalas though. Snow Crest is a new hotel.  After checking in, we had a good lunch.  Mother rest for a while and I went to explore the temple.  First things first - temple has a Kerala like system.  There are set poojas and Darshan is limited during this time.  One can take tickets for observing the poojas as well as other sevas.  I learned about this and tried to get tickets for some evening / morning poojas. There are a bunch of ticket counters around temple, again no hassle of touts.  The temple opens at 4.30 for Darshan in the afternoon and the counters open at the same time.There are a number of pujas (similar to sevas in Tirupati, however, performed in the sanctum sanctorum itself).  The list should be there on the web site.  I tried to get for Aarti or Vishnu Sahasranamam or the Closing puja (Sayana puja). Managed to get for Vishnu Sahasranamam.  The lady in the counter was very kind and directed me to the main counter inside to see if they've any blocked slots for the Sayana puja.  So I went into the temple, there was hardly a 10 mins wait.The Darshan was beautiful.  Badrinath Ji and his accomplices looked splendid, I could peacefully pray for a few minutes directly in front.  Unlike Kedarnath Ji, no one is allowed inside the Garbha Griha though.  I stepped out and finished Darshan of idols outside.  Don't miss the Nara-Narayana sannidhi!I went to the main counter and I was pleasantly surprised that one last ticket was available for the Sayana puja!  Mom will be super happy!I then headed out to enquire about the Brahma Kapal / Pithru Tharpanam procedure.  There is a  Ghat to the left of the temple and plenty of Pandas offering services here.  The belief is that if one does Pithru tharpanam at Brahma Kapal, no further tharpanams need to be done at other places such as Gaya etc.  (of course one should continue the regular tharpanam).  The temple provides Naivedya Rice for making Pindams.  One needs to bring basic things such as Panchapatram etc, rest everything is provided by the pandit.  One needs to watch out for greedy ones that recommend Daanam after tharpanam.  I was told that there are many packages from 1001 to 25000!Armed with all this, I went back and got mom back to temple by 5.30 pm.  The crowd had increased, still no much queue to enter.  After another round of Darshan, we waited for the Sahasranamam puja.  After various aaratis, our turn came.  We entered and to our utter dismay found that people had occupied every inch in front of the Garbhagriha! I gather people influence guards and priests and sneak in.  Anyways, the feeling was special - sitting in front of Badrinath Ji and listening to the chanting!  It lasted for about half an hour and we exited (be prepared for the typical madness to get blessings etc).We waited for another 2 hours for the Sayana Pooja. In between, the seer came for Darshan and there was a tremendous swell leading to a bit of delay.  Entering inside for Sayana Pooja was similar to the earlier one, quite chaotic.  People shamelessly enter the queue and sneak in, some habits never change I guess.Sayana Pooja was incredible.  Step by step, the Alankarams (Decorations) are removed amidst chanting and eventually the bare moorthis are exposed.  This Pooja lasts for almost 45 minutes and one gets tremendous vibes.We exited the temple close to 9 pm and had dinner right outside - dosas! Not bad for a high altitude, remote location.Next day, we got ready by 5.30 and reached the temple by 6.  The queue for Darshan was building up - it took us almost 2.5 hours to have Darshan eventually.  I was told that morning Darshan is always crowded and better to get in by like 4.30 AM.We quickly proceeded to the Ghat area for tharpanam.  It was drizzling and quite cold that morning (Neelkantha peak was not visible at all thanks to the dense fog).  I had bought a Dothi previous evening and sat down for the tharpanam by the river.  A Telugu speaking acharya led us (I joined a couple of southern folks) through the process.  After about half an hour, took the Pindas and after keeping on Brahma Kapal Rock, I prayed to ancestors and dropped those in the river.  The water was ice cold.We returned to the hotel and I decided to move out quickly as the weather was getting bad.  After a quick lunch, we left Badrinath by 1.30.It had started raining and hence the roads were tricky.  We had to stop for almost 45 minutes due to a landslide - eventually, we were waved off one car at a time and asked to rush while looking out for incoming stones!  This was a little scary.  We made our way down and reached Rudraprayag by 8 PM.Rudraprayag is a bustling town.  Our stay at hotel Mandakini was good (except for a silly, intentional mistake - the receptionist assured the food is all vegetarian, however, while ordering food, the guests on next table asked for Chicken and promptly served!  Why lie?)We started bright and early and reached Rishikesh by 11.30.  The drive was perfect, along side raging Ganga.  After a quick tour of Laxman Jhoola, ghat, the Thryambakeshwar temple (setup like a mall, felt more like an exhibition than a temple) and picking up some stuff for kids and a quick lunch, it was time to dash to the airport.We thus concluded our three-Dham trip in a most fulfilling way thanks to divine blessings and wishes from dear ones.A few learnings :1) bargain hotel rates2) carry some food all the time3) be flexible as weather, traffic, temple Darshan can be unpredictable (I had a full buffer day, eventually didn't need it)4) park your ego at home, people are nice5) have cash and change with you; plenty of sadhus and pandas around.  Remember, they're dependent on pilgrims, that too for 5-6 months in a year only.6) food is not an issue, most places accommodate special requests7) driving is tough as roads are demanding - be empathetic to the driver.  Be alert and make sure he is fresh and not sleepy!"
"Hello everyone. We a group of 11 members with minimum age of 19 and maximum of 60 years visited kedarnath and badrinath temple this may. I specifically want to write this post for travellers  planning for kedarnath. The trek distance is not 16km it's total of 21 km, but the board's and all the information available considers only 16km. So please brace urself accordingly. The whole trek path is not at all equipped with toilets, rain shelter or even water source. For us it was real examination with rain and wind. Each and every member of our family had to go through lot of hardship. People who are planning to trek kindly send your laugauge through pittho because it's very difficult to walk specially with bags. Do carry basic medicines. We enjoyed the temple and definitely the scenic beauties but really heart broken to see one of the most prestiouges temples of India in this condition. Lot many things are needed to be done. Weather and slope of the path is already a big challenge, lack of facilities and shelters make it even more worse. Key points:1) pls don't carry heavy bags.2) Do keep some gap in the itenary. Two days for kedarnath is a must.3) carry oxygen cylinder and important medicines.4)pls keep lot of emergency cash, as there is no way to withdraw cash.5)proper woollen clothes are needed.It's difficult but not impossible. Keep the spirit high and chant lord shiva. Every individual have different experience.Don't loose hope! Be safe keep travelling.Feel free to message for any support."
"I visited this place with family. We have planned to go by helicopter but as it was early/starting days helicopter were not working because government has not given permission to fly if possible plan for this place sometime in May and June, we were there in May . please get your travelers registration cards done at the beginning of the trip without this you are not allowed to start your journey if possible book your horses also in advance at the counters.We all took horses and it is quite stressful journey for everyone involved. it takes around 6-7 hours to reach up and to go up each horse costs you Rs 1100-1500(As per govt rules) but as we were more members we didn’t get much horses from govt counter so we need to book it in black whose rate are different as per timing & public rush (We got horses between Rs 3000-3500) as i said it is stressful journey , quite busy and hectic narrow roads up the hill and half the path doesn’t have railings and everyone has that one narrow road to use so watch out carefully also bring along adequate food, water and rain jackets usually many people  buy these things on the way but as usual its better to have your own with you. As we were more members some started between 8:30-9:00am and last members started at 10am so all reached the temple at different time between 3:45pm to 4:45pm (One the way after 2pm everyday atmosphere changes and it starts raining we too have faced this situation rain with snow for all most 1:30-2:00 hrs) but temple closes at 5pm all members were too tired and were not in a situation to do darshan in next 15min but while going on the way to our booked rooms we met one Maharaj who has spoken with us and given us energy to walk fast and do darshan quickly before temple close so all members agreed and we did darshan as there was no queue after that as our rooms were booked in advance so we stayed there at night but I think almost temperature was between -3 to -5degrees it was too cold at midnight , govt also provides tent to stay there but as we have done advance booking in Ashram we stayed there.       While returning back next day morning no one was ready to sit on horse so some members took pithu  and other members walked down but it is dangerous to walk also one need to be much careful as its very slippery the pithu costed us Rs 4000-5000 (Depends upon weight) for each and it took us around 6 hours to reach Gaurikund. Note the followingIf HELICOPTERS service has started it is preferable to go by HELICOPTERS and you can avoid long queues up for darshan as helicopter also involves VIP darshan. (In early days/starting  HELICOPTERS service depends up on govt permission & if it has started than also everything depends upon atmosphere as climate changes daily & quickly)Bring enough food, rain jackets, trekking shoes , good backpack aged people face difficulty in taking oxygen so pl give them KAPUR to smell at regular intervals.Try to reach early & start early around 4-5 am to avoid big rush.Be careful and alert. Keep torch with you as there is electricity problem."
"It is one of my most memorable and beautiful journey of my life.I booked a 4 wheeler form Haridwar to Kedarnath and Badrinath trip.There are two ways to reach the temple. One way by trekking or ponny ride of 22kms. other way you can go through a helicopter.If you go by treeking, you have to stay that night near to the temple. you can find goverment camp costing rs50/100 per day. If you are going by heli ride, you can return on that day.We went through heli ride, view from the heli is amazing. The temple is sourrounded by cnow clad mountains magnifying its beauty. please choose the right season to go there, summer season is best, but we went in september."
"Visited Kedarnathji Temple on 11th May 2015. Took Helicopter (Rs 7000 per person to & fro) from Rampur. It is very convenient to reach Kedarnathji Temple via Helicopter. Just 7 minutes flight. There are several Helicopter services available. Can go through trekking also but it is around 21 kms and take 5 to 6 hours. Ponies are easily available. Temple is just 300 mtrs from Helipad. Way to temple is perfect. Currently less Rush at temple. Govt. Arrangements are very good. You need to get Biometric pass from Rishikesh. Medical clearance need to be taken from Rampur. I think these are just formalities. However carry small Oxygen cylinder (Avl on rent in Rampur) in case you have some Asthmatic problem. Carry Ghee and Vastra with you to perform Puja at Shiva Linga. Rest all avl at Mandir premises. Can get Rs 1100 per head Darshan pass from Rampur, which will further ease Puja and Darshan at Temple. Feel highly satisfied by Lord Shiva's Darshan. On Namo Shivay!"
"Started this yatra on 25/04( the second day of opening), in Son Prayag a medical examination is carried out, basically 4 doctors( 2 registering and 2 examining) are manning the cramped room, It took me 2,5 hours to clear this hurdle, pls ensure your blood pressure is normal, as many yatris were declared unfit.Around 200 metres walk from check post of Sonprayag, take a jeep for around 2,5 km and from there onwards start trekking to Gaurikund. The total distance now is aprox 20km or more from Sonprayag. Two more checkpoints for registering the char dam card. Many ponnies and palkis are available in SonPrayag ,Gaurikund and also along the way. But the pricing is still the same( as far as I enquired.)90% of the journey is ascending , so do prepare. After the second town after Gaurikund, no shops are available for purchasing any foods, not even in Kedarnath,so pls buy adequate essentials in advance. Along the way few rest stops and public water tanks are placed for public convenience. If you think the tap water wont be suitable for consumpation, pls bring mineral water as required.the journey is tough ascending between ices for the 40% of the journey with mountain clearing workers camps at few places . 1.5km away from the kedarnath temple, the GMVN has set up cottages and tents for minimum price and NIM  has also set up tents for public accomodations around 1 km from temple.It was raining and snowing on the 25/04, so nobody were there in temple except us and the security. Surrounding the temple ,ice formation is higher than the temple. Devotees are allowed into the inner temple in the mornings only. Checked in to the only available hotel within temple vicinity and stayed the whole night in bed.The next morning the temple doors opened at 7,30 am,amidst a long queue of devotees, we managed to go in within 20 minutes, and Kedarnath surprised me, HE wasn't like other SHIVA temples I have seen. Magical, mystified and bliss, Kedarnath is all in one. The tough walk amidst rain, icestone rain and snow flakes was worth the bliss. Enjoyed the journey albeit a struggling and testing walk."
"This is my 2nd visit and 2nd Post for this to help the travelers.. Last time i did the visit by trekking and this time i used all the means like ponies and helicopter service.Yes trekking is very difficult if you are not used to it but i can say nothing is impossible if any point you feel you can't during your trekking then you can get pony. In helicopter it take only 10 mins to reach and 10 min to back from temple yes waiting would be little bit longer as lot off heli services introduced this year and they have scheduled time to & fro.  pony 1400-2100INR(to) max and for heli service from 6500-9500INR(to and fro).Try to avoid pony when you are coming back from temple.Book your online registration for Kedarnath darshan(100INR) and get your bio-metric registration at Rishikesh bus stand and start your journey .Always avoid rainy season, best season is September last/October and you will get some hotels at kedarnath temple for night halt, always start your journey early morning 4or4.30AM."
Its been a life-time opportunity to seek blessings of Lord Kedarnath. Visited on 7th June 2013.With the recent natural fury..I do not know when next. The journey from Haridwar to Kedardham and Badridham is a total divine experience culminating in receiving blessings. Hope the Yatra resumes soon.May all souls departed from Uttarakhand during last fortnight rest in eternal peace.
"I visited Kedarnath temple in the month of may. Trekking of a 14 km distance from Gaurikund is an amazing experience. One should try to go by walk from Gaurikund to kedarnath as the immense pleasure you will experience by the <a class=""inlineAdmedialink"" href=""#"">beauty</a> of nature is unexplainable. But remember to start early in the morning from Gaurikund preferebly 5 AM in the morning as the weather may become volatile after 12 pm in the noon. I experienced dizziness after reaching kedarnath due to shortage of oxygen. Hence try to carry an oxygen cylinder (small size cylinders are available at Gaurikund for Rs around 300; you can return them if unused which inturn fetch you u refund after deducting some amount). Dont forget to carry hand gloves with you and a good quality woolen jacket. One thing I assure you that people of Uttaranchal are very friendly towards the tourists hence no need to have any <a class=""inlineAdmedialink"" href=""#"">safety</a> related concerns."
"Visiting Kedarnath is a lifetime ambition. We can reach Kedarnath by helicoter from Phata @ Rs 6000 to 7000 bothways but taking helicopter route is advisable in September. We visited during June and during that time heavy fog leads to cancellation of ride suddenly and therefore the journey becomes unpredictable. We were forced to halt for night stay at Phata due to fog and could take off to Kedarnath next day early morning and it takes only 10 minutes to reach. Alternatively go to Gaurikund and from there either walk or hire a horse. For old people Paalki arrangement is there. After reaching Kedarnath, weather is cold and Kailash with snow gives a chilling feeling. We can perform Puja inside the temple. Behing the temple, huge rock that saved the damage to temple during flooding has been named as Bheem Shila. Rehabilitation is in full swing. Good arrangement for night stay with free wifi service. Only BSNL network available. We could complete puja and Darshan within half an hour. Huge Nandi statue in the front portion of temple and people believe that you whisper your desire in the ear of Nandi and it wold be fulfilled. After the Darshan we cold not return via Helicopter route due to fog and after waiting for about 5 hours, decided to return on horse. We reached Gauri Kund in about 4.5 hours. Journey is quite tiring as slope is steep at times."
"The Jyothirlinga is not only huge but also very powerful. We as a group of 10 people had struggled our way through the 18 km trek from Gauri Kund, but after spending some time in the temple and witnessing the evening Aarti, you feel so refreshed. The new path is safe & wide but poorly designed as it is a constant upward ramp. Walking up a distance of 18 km on a continuous uphill ramp is very tiring. You can use horse or helicopter as well to reach the temple. Much better facilities on the top now a days with room heating, hot water and hot food. Don't bother carrying sleeping bags up the hill. They are all provided in the Accomodation."
"We 6 planned to visit Kedarnath and Badrinath along with Chopta ,Tunganath in the month of October,2019. We started discussing this programme in the month of March. After searching so many things we fixed up our date of journey on 15th October, 2019. Our journey from Kolkata to Delhi via Rajdhani Express then to Haridwar via Janshatabdi. We booked our Up and Down tickets accordingly. As per  advise of earlier visitors we have not booked any hotels or lodges. In their opinion in the month of October travellers are very less and so no need of prior booking.Lastly the most important thing was left out to select a reliable travel co from where we can hire our vehicle for  entire journey. From different corner I got name and number of several companies. From different review  I contacted few of  them but I was not fully satisfied about them,Lastly I contacted SHUBH YATRA HOLIDAYS PVT. LTD a travel Co of Hrishikesh, and talked to Navinji (9760093327,9761275227), the owner of the co which suits me in all respect. He requested me to send  mail covering details of our journey. Immediately on receipt of my mail they informed me details of charges and other terms and conditions. Our contract was from Haridwar to Haridwar. Ultimately I finalise to hire vehicle(Innova) from them and  remit a small amount as a token of advance.On 16th October they informed me the name of the driver as well as his contact no. On 16 night I contacted the driver Surajji(9760755424) and he informed that he will  reach by 8 am at our hotel.Next day we were ready and found Syrajji is already there with a New Innova.We started our journey with Suraji , a middle aged man with always smiling face.First we reached Hrishikesh and meet Navinji . a nice gentleman,in his office and  pay him some amount of money and rest will be paid after completion of journey.What I can say about Surajji. Any thing I said about Surajji it will be less about him.During entire journey he selected hotels, way side dhaba as per choice. stopped the vehicle anywhere we asked him without any question rather he helped us to visit different unknown spot.We came to know that this company replace their vehicle on every 2 to 3 years. So you can easily understand the condition of the vehicleFinally i like to say that our selection of Shubh Yatra was  very very subha for our journey. All of us very very satisfied about the service rendered by Shubh Yatra , specially Navinji and Surajji.Special Thanks to them."
"We started off our kedarnath trek from Nainital city on motorbike. We started early morning and reached Gairsain at afternoon. After our lunch and haults at Aadibadri we reached Karnprayag by evening. We continue our drive till Guptkashi and had our night stay there. Next morning we left for Soneprayag with beautiful waterfall and Himalaya view along our way. Roads were muddy and filled with water, one has to be carefull while driving. After 2 hours drive we reacged Soneprayag where we registered for the yatra. After 5 min drive on local taxis as , no personal vehicles are allowed beyond this point, we reached Gaurikund. Trek starts from Gaurikund to kedarnath temple. Its highly exhausting and adventurous trek. One has to pass through beautiful waterfalls and views on there way. The remain of Kedarnath natural calamity still visible one you reach Rambada. One can see the washed aways remains of  landslides and the forces of nature that it witnessed. Just before the basecamp which 4 kms from Kedarnath temple, rainfall started. The weather changes very quickly at high hills. It become freezing by the time we reached Kedarnath temple at evening. After reaching our hotel we hurried ourselves for evening aarti at temple. It was Devine and beautiful. One could feel the devine presence with all those mantras chanting and sound of bells. Next morning was bliss. Clear blue sky and white Himalayas to cherish our morning. Roaming the temple primises in morning was another experience. It gave freshness to the core. Then we trekked for Bhairav mandir for Arial view of kedarnath valley. It was one of the most beautiful sights one could have. We met young sadhus meditating at top and enjoying the Devine presence. One has to go for kedarnath trek once in a lifetime to be alive and close to oneself and mother nature."
"I am lucky to be there at Kedarnath and had a wonderful darshan of Jyoutriling. You can’t explain the beauty of the place in words. I have visited Kedarnath temple on 15th May, 2018.  It is one of the twelve Jyotrilings. The Siva linga is not the same as usual we see on other place. It’s quite different.  Temple is just next to Mandakini river and it is covered with snow caped mountai.  Still renovation work is going on. I would like to share my journey experience which will helpful to other.  We were looking for Helicopter but we didn’t get the ticket due to heavy demand and fewer aviators are operating. There is no online booking available for Helicopter. It’s purely based on luck or your contacts with aviator. It’s very difficult to go by Horse (pony).  There are to total five options to go to the Kedarnath Temple1.       Helicoter2.      Horse (Pony)3.      Kandi4.      Doli5.      By walk: Walking is extremely difficult as the road is not proper and very narrow.We have booked our Hotel at Sonprayag. Private vehicle goes till Sonprayag.  As we didn’t get the helicopter so we have decided to go by horse. We are total six including my parent. Horse owner will try to approach you at Sonprayag. We chose a person who has six ponies. Don’t pay money to Horse’s owner.  At Gourikund there is govt. counter where you have to pay the amount and get the receipt. The same receipt you have to give it to then horse owner once you reached at Kedarnath. Horse owner will get his money back with that receipt. It’s a good process by Govt. You can’t able to get the receipt for horse riding without your registration card. Hence make sure you have your registration card before coming to Kedarnath.  Because of this, horse owners are bound to take you till the temple. It’s better to get their ID along with you. From Sonprayag to Gaurikund (appx 5 km) only local vehicle are there with charge 20 rupees. Pony (horse) charge 2500 form Gaurikund to Kkedarnath (16km).  From Gaurikund your journey will start.  Horse riding is very difficult as there are 90% chances that you will fall from horse. In our journey four felt including me out of six. If elder are there then big no to horse.  We started at 7am from Gaurikund and reached temple at 1pm. We halted once as horse needs some rest. Be careful while sitting on Horse. Road is very narrow and steep. Road condition is also very bad for almost half of the entire road.  Once you get down from Horse you have to walk 2km to reach the temple. Normally queue is very big. As the air pressure is less, you will be in shortage of Oxygen. .  Keep Karpur while travelling which will help you in breathing.  We kept oxygen cylinder which we got from Gaurikund. You can return that in same shop if you are not using by giving rent(100 rupees). Even if same you can do for rain coat also.  We had a very nice darsan.  We stayed there near the temple (Punjab Sindh Awas). We also got a chance to see evening Aarti. At night temperature was below zero. As we came to know the difficulties in Horse riding, we tried our luck for Helicopter Sport booking for return. But no luck, even if 2hrs in queue. Then we have decided to go back by horse.  Pony charge was 1500 from Temple to Gaurikund. It was more dangerous while returning in horse. It took little less time to reach Gaurikund. We reached Sonprayag by 1pm. By that time all are tired and everybody’s back was in too much pain.Only Jio and BSNL are working fine at Kedarnath. Airtel is not working.My suggestions try your best to go by Helicopter and keep one or two days in buffer even if you got the booking in Helicopter as the weather is unpredictable at Kedarnath"
Kedarnath temple is 3000 year old temple situated at 14000 feet height.  The temp goes. In minus celcious in nights.  The temple was built by Pandvas and is a  beautiful and powerful place of Lord Shiva to visit. There is a scheduled flight operated by 9 helicopter companies from Phata helipad and it's a 10 min flight at around 7000 rupee return journey.  If you wish to save time and do char dham yatra you have plenty of charter helicopter services available from dehradun or Haridwar and they charge 4 to 5 Lac for 5 people for 4 dham yatra.  For individual seat if they have available be ready to pay out 1.25 lacs to 1.6 lacs depending on your negotiation skills. Be very careful of what agents say and promise and take every thing in written before making payments. Kedarnath you can do quick darshan by buying VIP ticket at 2500 rupee per person and 10 min you are through else it can take 4 to 8 hours depending on rush of people travelling by horse palki or by feet
"I visited the kedarnath temple with my parents. i did not do much of advanced planning which was a mistake. Please book the helicopter tickets well in advance and if possible plan for sometime in june and july and august, we were there in may and the helicopter was booked well in advance 2-3 months before. please get your travellers registration cards done at the begining of the trip where the cars are not allowed anymore. also pay and if possible book your horses also in advance at the counters.We took horses and it is quite stressful journey for everyone involved. it takes around 6 hours to reach up and to go up the each horse costs you 1800 rupees. as i said it is quite busy and hectic narrow roads up the hill and half the path doesnt have railings and everyone has that one narrow road. so watchout. also bring along adequate food and water and rainjackets. usually you buy these thigns on the way but as usual its better ot have your own food with you. we started at 6 and reached the temple at 12:30 and stood in the line for 3 hours for darshan. the temple closes at 3pm and opens again at 5 pm, so if possible try to have darshan before 3. we started back at 3:30 and it started raining. As mom and dad werent happy with horses we tool dholis and i walked down. i fel down thrice in the mud on the road as its very slippery and dangerous. the dholis costed us 4000 rupees for each and it took us around 6 hours to reach gaurikund. Note the followingBOOK HELICOPTER IN ADVANCE (2-3 months) and you can avoid long queues up for the darshan as helicopter also involves VIP darshan.bring food, rain jackets, trekking shoes and good backpack.rent horses only from the public counters and not from the random people. try to start early at 4 am to avoid big rushbe careful and alert. bring a torch alogn for getting down at night, thought there are lights sometimes there is powercut :("
"Jai shiv Shankar ...Must visit once in life time . It is Holy place and one of the 12 Jyotirlingas. It is situated 223 km from Rishikesh and is 11755 feet above the sea level . Himalayan/Shivaliks are surrounding the temple and you will have a very beautiful view . It is near Mandakini river . you can feel the presence of Lord shiva and the area will definitely give you peace and blessings  . just plan properly in advance because the terrain is little bit difficult . Mainly it is open between April end to November month. It will be cold so take winter clothes along with you. Although oxygen level is ok but if you have old age family members then for precautionary take small oxygen cylinders from base area. These cylinders are not much costly . If you can afford helicopter then only go for it , it will be much more comfortable and less time consuming . Also the money difference is not much high in compare to riding on horse . Helicopter cost per person is 7000. You can take helicopter by Phatta or Guptakashi . But remember the helicopter needs to be book in advance and you have to be lucky to get tickets. Book at least one month in advance. We took early morning helicopter from Phatta and came back by 12 afternoon. You can also take VIP pass of 2100 Rs per person  to avoid the line of 1 to 2 hours and can manage to come back early. sometimes due to whether condition your helicopter may take off next day. First half of the day before 12 is normally clear than second half of the day. Tents are also available for the night stay . Jai Bholenath, Jai Shivshankar , Jai Kedarnath ..."
"We were on the tour of chardham yatra of Uttarakhand, we reached Sitapur in the evening of 24/05/2013 and stayed at very ordinary hotel Annapurna because of over bookings of good hotels. We leave for Kedarnath early in the morning 5.00 AM of 25/05/2013 and took pony from Gauri kund and reached Kedarnath 10.30 AM. Darshan and Puja performed by us with the help of local purohit, holy experience and spiritual feelings. Returned back at 7.00PM at sitapur hotel. Hotel Shivalic and Hotel JPG Palace is a good option to stay at Sitapur"
"This was the best time to visit temple. No crowd at all, it was easy to perform pooja at sanctum sanctorum of the temple. With handful of people around it was easy to had a visit to the temple. Had go around the temple and tried to re-collect memories when had visited the temple post 2013 Floods. Things have changed and are now very well managed. a lot of space around which was earlier cluttered."
"We started our journey from Rishikesh by Tempo Traveller which is hired at Haridwar @ 7800/- per day on 17.05.18.(details ph no. and rate per day shared in photo enclosed.). however this rate may varies according to season. At Rishikesh we stayed at Jairam Annakhestra ashram. A decent ashram with neat & clean atmosphere. Decent place but for room rent one can bargain. We started our journey on 17.05.18 towards Kedarnath. Our car reaches upto sonprayag. Leaving the car on same rent i.e. 7800/- per day we reached Gourikund through Jeep @ Rs.20/- per head. In this portion no personal car permitted to go upto gourikund. If for any reason  government jeep service not available then you have to go by foot.From gourikund you can hire horse(actually Khacchar)  or Duli/Palki upto 18km at ghora stand which is 1.5 km from temple, after wards you have to go temple by foot. by.Horse - 2500 (upward) 1500 (downward) Doli - Rs.8000/- (within 60 Kg) above 60 kg -Rs.8500/-, Helicopter - 6500(Govt), 8400(private). Doli is very small Size. upward journey by Horse, downward by walk best.You can also use helicopter service which is available in different place. At Phata we took Helicopter for Kedarnath. Journey from Phata to Kedarnath is just 8 minutes by helicopterWe booked through Pinnacle Air (Amit Pinnacle Air; Mobile：094123 22968;) at Rs. 6700 per ticket both ways from their Phata helipad to go and return on the same day (17th June 2018). We booked over a month in advance but you can at times book on the same day also,depending on availability. The ride is for about 6 minutes each way."
Must visit baba kedarnath once in life. But visit before mansoon. Don't go heart patient. When I go not much gathering and find darshan easily.
"Around 10 hrs of horseback riding, while going up to Kedarnath Temple and coming down is a sheer test of endurance. It is one of the most gruelling ride, which I could have never imaginedThe steep hill roads with deep ravines all along, is an unforgettable site. It is almost a miracle to reach back safely.As they say, only Lord grants you the courage and strength to visit him in this abode.Some suggested Do's and Dont's1) Unless you are really really fit, don't try going uphill on foot. The new route from Rambara is very steep all the way. Also the Horses and Doly pushing along the narrow road make the walking experience very difficult.2) 10 hrs of Horseback riding is very gruelling. From Rambara upwords there are no railings on the new route. While coming back on horse downhill, the horse skids a few times. It is an experience not explainable in words...3) Book Helicopter in advance. We thought we would get booking a few days earlier but it gets tricky. The middlemen/touts ask for extra money and still you can be stuck for the ride, on account of weather or other pretexts.  I saw groups which were waiting for 2+ days for their turn on helicopter ride. Waiting from Morning to evening 6 PM at the Chopper shed!4) The Doly walas are not enough and all tickets get sold out by 9 am. The only option left is horses. One Doly wala quoted me 14,000 since all tickets from Govt Doly counter were sold out.5) Try to stay one night on the top, near the Mandir. There are several accomodations which are pretty reasonable.6) We took priority darshan ticket for 1100. The Priest did an excellent Pooja.7) This Tirth like others, is worth every bit of effort. It is an amazing feeling to Pray to Lord at this Temple. While remembering all this, I feel so lucky and blessed for this rare darshan."
"i have visited this place on 29th Sept 2015, this is off season here so very less no of people are there to visit.We caught the direct bus at 4:30 AM from haridwar to Phata. reached at around 3PM there. we have already booked the pawan hans tkt online for the next day. so just below the helipad at phata we stayed at a small homestay. Biometric and medical check up is compulsury now. next day we reach at kedarnath around 9:30AM. get view at around kedarnath. very less crowded hence darsan was very good. returned on the same day by heli at around 12PM. you can also stay there at kedarnath, very good arrangemant by GMVNL amd NIM. huts and tent facilities are there . very comfotable arrangement and also a good canteen for food. after returning to base we planned for Triyunginarayan temple , take a share taxi from gourikund, 1.5hr traveeling time from gourikund taxistand  to temple.returned to phata till evening. stayed in phata and next day early morning catch the 1st bus to guptakashi at around 6 AM. reached at guptakashi at around 6:40AM. then catch a direct bus from there to gopeswar through tunganath temple route. this is the only one bus in this route. from there we got a share taxi to badrinath. reached at badrinath at around 4:30PM."
Divine is what Sums up my visit to Kedarnath temple .Feeling so blessed with the grand location and the majestic temple. However the journey is treacherous and difficult for the uninformed.Plan well and be safe.  Involves a walk of 17 kms one way or a pony ride or a 5 mins of helicopter ride.

"This is one of the Most Sacred Temples of God Shiva, as per my knowledge and belief 2nd in India after Amarnath. Further, one from 12 famous Jyotirlingas of God Shiva.Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open only between the end of April (Akshaya Tritriya) to November (Kartik Purnima). So, don't forget to carry winter cloths.To reach Kedarnath, direct buses from Rishikesh to Sonpryag early morning around 5am. Sharing Taxi available from Sonpryag to Gauri Kund. Gauri Kund is the place from where walking journey is starts. Here one can also hire Ghoda or Khachchar. Helicopter package also available from Sitapur & phata."
