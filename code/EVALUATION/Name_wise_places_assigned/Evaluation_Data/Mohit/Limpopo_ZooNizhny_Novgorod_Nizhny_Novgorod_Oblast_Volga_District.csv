"After having been at the Moscow Zoo the week before (half of it being remodeled and closed), I was really impressed by the zoo in Nizhny Novgorod.  There is a wide variety of animals - everything from kangaroos to tigers.  The grounds, cages, etc. were all clean and everything seemed well cared for.  It is a wonderful place to go spend a few hours as a family."
