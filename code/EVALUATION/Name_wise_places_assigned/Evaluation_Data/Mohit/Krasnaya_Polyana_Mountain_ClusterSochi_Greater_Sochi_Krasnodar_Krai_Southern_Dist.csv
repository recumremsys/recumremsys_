"Indeed a wonderful place to visit and enjoy the nature, especially in summer its most attractive with freshness of the nature around. Exiting vacation point and love to spend time around with family or friends."
"A trip to Krasnaya Polyana is interesting here mountains, clear mountain air, crystal clear water of the rivers, flora and fauna, but the animals I was not able to see and photograph them on camera. All the animals live here in the mountains far from people and construction of various facilities for the Olympic Games. In the mountains I climbed to an altitude of 1500 meters above sea level. Animal I have not seen here only plants and trees. Guide in the mountains was a resident at an army jeep, which suggested to me by my guide, for an additional fee. Do not forget to specify when ordering on a tour of what you see and what will be a stop on the road in the meadow. Great choice of routes, as well as travel agencies in Sochi. I ordered a hike in the mountains with a guide, cableway, lunch, and stops at tourist attractions. The purpose of my trip here to take pictures of mountains and attractions. First stop was the viewing platform overlooking the gorge Ahtsu, beautiful mountain views and even fly helicopters here along the gorge. At the second stop called ""Bear Corner"" all the tourists drinking seltzer water healing, here is the mineral springs of water. Water from this source was to the taste pleasant and invigorating, I felt that it might even sweet. Take a 1.5 liter bottle to fill it with water, which I did in the absence of packaging. Before entering into the source of the locals sell honey which is extracted industrious bees in the vicinity of the Caucasus Reserve. The third stop was at the waterfall ""Girls tears"", where you can take pictures of waterfalls and mountain views. Here we are at Krasnaya Polyana, in a wine tasting and honey from a local resident. After the tasting we were brought to the restaurant where we dined. Everything was tasty and inexpensive here. At the exit from the restaurant we waited for a local guide in the mountains at an army jeep, which took us, me and three people from the group in the mountains, but only to places where there is snow, because it was impossible to drive farther, and we walked through the snow up. For this trip bring athletic shoes, but you can not take it, because you can even sunbathe here at the height of the mountains, and the form of snow happy it's warm here. There is also a beautiful view of the Krasnaya Polyana at the foot of the mountain Aibga where you can photograph the panorama of the mountain range with snow-capped peaks. After a trip into the mountains brought us to the cableway, where we waited for a part of our group. There is also a good view of mountains and rivers, which resemble snakes, and of course the fresh mountain air. I really liked it here, especially the mountains. Skiers do not have here, as the ski season ends in mid-May, but tourists are always here a lot. I know what draws them here, the mountains."
"Need to take 4 cableway to reach 2500 meter, fresh air and incredible view, strongly recommended. don't fofget the sunblock cream in case of sunshine day/"
"Visited in February 2015 and had an amazing time with the family as we tried out the three major resorts in the mountain cluster and discovered an unmatched breadth of facilities and opportunities for skiing down slopes and cross country, despite being very busy. The resort dwarfs the ""well established European"" equivalents for the quality of facilities, unmatched scenery, views and its proximity to the infrastructure of the Sochi city. The unique location allows visitors to explore the wider area on snowmobiles, as we did, and also to go ice skating on Sochi's excellent  skating rinks. We also went on brilliant excursions in the wider Sochi area and took a boat trip. An overall unforgettable experience and we will definitely return.Contrary to the anti-Russian politically motivated propaganda, including the previous review, Sochi and its winter resorts (three major locations) had record visitor numbers in the 2014 season with all hotels reporting record occupancy rates. As testament to its popularity Sochi for the first time appeared in the Prime Ski Property Index ranking 11th out of 20 world resorts  and beating a number of heavily publicized resorts including Switzerland's glitzy Gstaad, which we visited 2 years ago. I can see why as other resorts pale in comparison with the Sochi mountain cluster's scale, beauty and location."
We've visited the mountain cluster by cable car and the ride was so adventurous and great. Don't miss this cable car ride if you visit Krasnaya Poliyana. Plus while you are going up to the mountains you'll see a breathtaking Panasonic view of Caucasus mountains.
We visited Gorki Gorod cluster cable car.We went to the peak 2350 Meter.K5 Calble car is must. Bring your own Food and drinks.
"We've visited the mountain cluster, with 6 persons. The trip was a part of the hotel booking that's why I don't know any prices. If you go to the mountain in the summer don't except to do anything then taking photos. There are no other activities, so if you have bigger children or teenagers it may be boring. Everything was new and in a very good shape. We felt very safe with all of the lifts. Check out the weather before going to the mountains. Otherwise it can be a very gray trip.I recommend to take also a look at the Galaktika center. It's really beautiful and has a lot of offers."
"One of thing you have to do in Sochi is going to Krasnaya Polyana , and uses Mountain Cluster. It will be wonderful. Very good view, virgin nature, Weather with much oxygen. Never miss it. Do it certainly."
"The town itself now resembles Disneyland with the amount of hotels being constructed for the winter olympics. Drive up there is an adventure mainly because of the other drivers overtaking on blind bends coming down the mountain road. Normally a scenic drive, this is now a 50km construction site, but still worth a visit to get into the mountains which are beautiful."
"The mountain cluster area of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics!  Spent several days here during the Olympic games!  Great transportation service via train (bus transportation also available) up to the Mountain cluster from the Sochi / Adler Coastal cluster.  Plenty of direction signs to help you get around once you arrive here.  lots of shopping and dining possibilities available especially in the Rosa Khutor area.  Beautiful high mountain scenery on a clear day! Safe, clean, scenic!  Great time!"
"Krasnaya Polyana is more like a region or city in Russia.  I wouldn't really consider a ""Thing to Do"" in Sochi, but more like another place to stay near Sochi.  Krasnaya Polyana is up in the mountains about 10 miles north of the airport where Sochi is located on the Black Sea about 10 miles West of the airport.We visited over Christmas for skiing. Lots and Lots and Lots of Construction going on. Pretty amazing size to see.  I'm a little skeptical that it will all be done before the Olympic Games in 2014, but we shall see. I hear there are 3 ski resorts in Krasnaya Polyana, although I only saw 2.  I heard the 3rd is closed for construction right now.  I visited Rosa Khutor and it was a nice mountain.  Very small right now, but also undergoing construction for new hills. The mountain was challenging. The Greens were closed and the Blues were basically aggressive cat-walks with switchbacks.  The Reds and Blacks were basically untouched terrain and very fun.  Definitely for experienced skiers and snowboarders. I had a lot of fun thought.  The mountain was somewhat busy, but nearly everyone stays on the catwalks.  So if you like the reds and blacks, you've got untouched terrain all to yourself.  Be careful on the blacks though, I would highly recommend going with a partner for safety reasons.  The blacks can get a little dangerous at times if you don't know what you're doing (like me!).The other mountain is Gazprom and is located by the Grand Polyana hotel.  I tried to go, but it was closed for Construction as well. The said sometime in 2013 it would open."
"Don't get me wrong, this centre is top of the range - one of the best I've ever visited (and I've skied for a long time!) The facilities were up to date and very effective and the views of the Games were breathtaking. The cable car up to Rosa Khutor Alpine Centre are glorious - be sure to check that out.My only fault is a horrendous feeling it won't last - which is a terrible shame. There are at least 5 or 10, 1000 room hotels which will never be filled again. It makes me so sad that all this money, effort and a lovely resort will go to waste..."
