"Theres no question Kaputas makes for a beautiful beach spot. We ended up leaving soon due to how crowded the place was. But regardless of whether you end up staying or not, this makes for a great photo stop in the Turquoise riviera."
Great spot to hang out and tan and swim. Compare to most beaches this one is sandy one! It’s just 20-25 Mins away from Kas with car. It’s one of hidden gems in Kas
"Kaputas beach is a special experience for swimmers. Water is gorgeously blue and clean. No doubt it will be crowded in high season and especially on the weekend so the trick is to go early on a weekday. Restaurant/cafe offers food and drinks and sun lounges and umbrella's available at a price. Tricky part is transport if you don't have a car. You can get a taxi there, but will find it difficult finding one once returning since the beach is situated on an express way. Worth arranging for a taxi pick up. Been there twice and would love to go again. Makes for a special half day at the beach."
"We loved this little beach, we found a little spot, set-up tent and and made sure to have snacks/foods for the day. There is a cafe at the top of the beach, but they are only serving water/tea/soda, hamburgers and ice cream basically. Make sure to pack extra sunscreen in your bag."
"İt is a small but beautiful and special beach with amazingly soft and clean sand.You can get there by taxi or public minibus from Central Kaş or Kalkan. Parking place for cars is very limited so if you are coming with a rented car and intend to stay long in the high season, perfer early morning hours so that you can find a parking spot. There is a  steep stairway from the main road to the beach which can be a problem for old or disabled. Once you are the enjoy the lovely clear and pure turqoise waters and beautiful sand. Entrance is free. There is a cafe for snacks and drink.Even the view from above the beach is worth to stop there and take pictures.Seen lots of beaches  around the world. I can say this one is in top 10."
"I can easily say this beach is the most famous beach in Turkey, it is also world wide known. It is in Kaş district of Antalya province. I went to this beach from Kalkan by minibus, it only took 5 minutes and I paid 3.5 TL. I went there early in the morning to make use of the morning light to shoot pix and videos. I stayed till noon and it got really busy. There is a cafe-restaurant here run by Kaş Municipality and I was happy I could buy beer ;). There are also changing rooms and showers. The beach and the sea do not require any comment, they speak for themselves. You can sleep in peace to the awesome sound of the waves.Just go there and see foryourself. You will like it a lot for sure. Thank me later ;)"
"While Kaputaş is by far the smallest beach on this list, its 500 feet of sand and surf make quite the lasting impression. Located right off the main coastal road between Antayla and Fethiye, Kaputas is hidden from view by steep, rocky cliffs, which shield the sandy enclave from the world above. Visitors must descend 186 steps to reach the picturesque beach, where the inlet’s calm, turquoise waters provide excellent swimming conditions. Be sure to arrive early to claim a lounge chair and umbrella, as the tiny beach fills up quickly in the summer months."
Beautiful beautiful waters! Be sure to get there easily to get unspoiled photos! We got there around 10:30am and there was no more than 20ppl.
"Don’t think twice, just go there. Absolutely stunning. There is a restaurant which however we haven’t used. They have showers and changing rooms available. Long chairs and umbrellas are available to rent at a decent price (30TLY for 2 long chairs and 1 umbrella)."
"This place is an real magic. No so quiet, as we expected (we visited kaputas during Turkish holidays), but beach is so beautiful. There was all necessery equipments - shower etc. Even small restaurant. Go there, you will find comfort and pure nature!"
"This mixed sand/pebble beach isn't too far from Kalkans (inferior) beach, just get the local dolmus from Kalkan centre near school/taxi rank, it costs 3.5 tl pp each way. Descend about 100+ steps to walkway/beach. Managed by Law Council and has Clean toilets(Turkish style) and changing rooms available. Also new cafe that provides simple but good quality food & drinks, such as Turkish pancakes, hamburgers, etc. Parasols & sunbeds, about 5tl each or day.Lifeguard normally on duty, swimming safety line to stop boats ingress to most of beach."
We got there at 3:30 and there was no parking. Get there early. The beach has blue water and is absolutely beautiful. Wavy and comfortable. Worth going out there to visit. But do not drive from Butterfly valley. Google maps brought us through gravel road and dirt roads. Surprised my tires didn't break. Take the 400 to get there.
You can get to this little gem by mini bus or car. Its a bit risky with a car since parking is very limited and extremely crowded.The beach is a bit wavy but very clean and nice. 5tl for umbrellas and 5tl for beach bed. Restaurant has limited food but I enjoyed the gozleme. Get here early because it gets super crowded.
"This beach well deserves its reputation as one of the best beaches in the world. The sand feels velvety, gently brushing your feet under the sea. No wonder caretta caretta turtles choose to lay their eggs here, the newborns can easily reach the sea. Take a boat trip from dalyan and stay here at least an hour. It's nearly 5 km long and the best spot is at the rivers mouth. If you want to see the turtles, drive to the other end of the beach. The caretta caretta hospital is on the way."
"Beautiful beach out of town , limited parking. Has facilities. Too far to walk. Very busy on Kalkan road."
"I didn't know water could be this color of turquoise. It is a quick dolmus ride from the Kas city center and worth an all-day stay. The beach chairs and umbrellas are inexpensive. Bring along a picnic or order food from the small shop on the beach (a tad expensive, but also handy)."
"Get a sun bed with umbrella and relax the day away at this stunning beach! Our teenagers climbed and jumped off the rocks on the left and the watercolor is beyond belief. After a few dips, best to leave your flip flops at waters edge for the small rocks start to hurt a bit."
"Beautiful beach, accessed by stairs. Small restaurant at the beach was closed when we got there in the early evening. Chairs must be rented, or bring your towel to lay on the beach. Enjoy!"
Get there early. Parking is now a nightmare!Still a lovely beach but a lot busier these days. There are now sun beds as well as parasols to rent.
Visited in September and the weather and crowds was perfect. The beach is absolutely beautiful against the backdrop of the dramatic cliffs. Restaurant and ice cream.available so one can spend an entire day here
Visited when turkish families were off with their children.  It's only 4 miles from kalkan up the coast.  Parking along the side of the road wherever you can and walk down the steps.  It's very photogenic but the sand itself is small stones.  Not harsh on the feet but they stick all over your body and are a right pain.  Beds without covers are 5.50tl and so are sunshades.
"super beautiful sandy beach with torquiose water layer, most beautiful beach in my opinion in the region! Bed and umbrella super cheap, only 5 TL for the rest of the day! come in may for view tourist and nice weather"
We spent a morning on the beach as we were exploring the coats near Kas.  The parking near to the beach was easy and the steps down and back up not that bad.  Compared to other beaches on our trip we found this a bit crowded given it was low season and a bit too close to the main road. It was also the only beach where we had to pay for loungers and umbrellas even if we bought a drink.  All that being said the sea was beautiful to swim and we had a nice morning there.
"The color of sea and the sandy beach is great, really loved that place. There is a cafe where you can buy something to eat&drink. There is no entrance fee but you need to pay to rent sunbeds and umbrellas but the prices are cheap. Recommend to go there in the morning before it gets too crowded and also in the morning, sea is more calm and nice for swimming."
"Like anything worth finding, there's a bit of effort involved. This beach is beautiful and the sea is a blue I've never seen before! If you're staying in Kalkan the steps are just like the hills :) huge waves are so much fun, and just a few feet beyond them you can float cheerfully and watch the action. 3 lira each on the dolmus, 10 for a bed & brolly and 8 lira for the most delicious gozleme (pancake) means a cheap day out too. My 4 yo loved the waves although he took a bit of warming up and had arm bands on. Grab a cold can on your way back up to the bus stop and take lots of pictures! *p.s. there's a timetable for the buses back so not too much hanging around."
"Fantastic beach to stop off at while driving up the turquois coast.  They had shower facilities to wash off and bathrooms if needed.  Be prepared to rent a chair or umbrella or be forced to the far corners which are only available for those that do not want to rent.  Since we would only be there for an hour we were fine stashing our towels off to the side.  Parking is tricky as it is on the side of the road, so go earlier in the day if possible as it can get VERY crowded"
I am in love with this beach! Try to go early in the morning. It is so crowded in afternoon and parking is a real problem. The sea is wavy also after a certain hour.
"Loved this beach, beautiful and a wonderful backdrop of mountains. It's a bit of a hike getting back up if you have walking problems but even then the view from above the beach is worth it."
"Beautiful beach but no chance to enjoy people actually queuing and the term packed in like sardines comes to mind . Tried to go early to no avail .The Secrets Out . A real Shame but  inevitable considering how small and the stair access . Was  amazing 4-5 years ago , memories!!."
"Stoney beach, lovely water but surprisingly cold for August!  Got a bed for 15TL, beautiful setting, simple snacks available.  Parking is a nightmare especially at weekend when the locals drive down from Istanbul.  Worth going as it's such a spectacular setting."
"one of the best beach ever been to !! amount the top five for me anyway , just a tad below the famous Mrytos beach in Greece .10 minutes drive tops from Kalkan , you should go after two o'clock as the day tripper start heading back ! the best place to be is the right hand side cliff face so you don't have to pay for the chairs and parasol"
"Found it on our was to Kas. Small and beautiful beach. The water is unbelievable, warmAns so clear. Came back on my last day if vacation"
"Hard to find park space, but facility and the beach was fabolous. Toilletes are sucks. Mu wife was stuck in there and called for help. Do not go to wc allone! , you need a company if you have clostrofobia or similar obsessiveness."
"Crazy beautiful place but because it is vere wavy, dont leave your kids unattended. The sea floor goes deep all of a sudden. The water is so clear and cold. Go there very early in the morning to have less trouble with parking. The place is run by the government. Quite cheap, food is nice. You can have a shower and change clothes. Enjoy it!"
"We went mid week to avoid the crowds but it was very busy, obviously a popular place but it wasn't for us. Most of the beach was populated by sun loungers and parasols...the food in the cafe looked ok but was so busy we couldn't get a table, after 10 mins we left and went back to Kalkan! Disappointed"
