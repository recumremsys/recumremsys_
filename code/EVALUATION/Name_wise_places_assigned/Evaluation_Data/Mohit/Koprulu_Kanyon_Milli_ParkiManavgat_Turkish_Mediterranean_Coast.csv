"The environment is awesome. White water all around, great cliffs and lot of waterfalls. Really worth visiting. When you arrive at the main area, you will be overwhelmed by Turks who want to sell you a trip on a boat, or raft. Make sure you compare, because prices can be very different. Especially the Turks who approach you while parking and calling you 'my friend', those will be the most likely to scheme. You can also find some rafting/ zip-lining companies online. Perhaps that is the better option.If you do not like rafting, you can take a boat, or just take a seat in a restaurant and enjoy the view.Absolutely worth to take a drive to this area."
Take a wander up the mountain Road beyond the canyon for wonderful views. We enjoyed visiting out of season when the river and roads were quiet.
"What great fun, 14 km paddling down stream, some rapids but not too serious, great fun having splashing competitions with other boats. Reasonable lunch. About two hours drive from Antalya. One word of advice. Don't buy this of the reps in the hotels. I was quoted £49 by Thomas Cook, £45 by Thompsons, and $45 by a Russian rep. I then spent €2 on the Internet cafe in the hotel, found a travel agent that offered €35,kept on looking and eventually found one of the companies themselves who run the trips on the river. Price? €28 yes that's under half the price that the two British companies were trying to rip me off for. Don't forget there are dozens of businesses up on the River, each with a few RIBS and kayaks, which go downstream together as a fleet. Forget the stories from the reps that their trips are better than others, it's a load of eyewash. Also some of the trips, which seemed to set off basically from the same area, simply go straight downstream. The one we were on however, includes pulling the boat upstream for about 500 m right between the cliffs of the Canyon itself on ropes suspended above the boats, to see a great waterfall before then starting the trip down the stream. Really worthwhile finding a tour that includes that. Overall a great day, you should really try to do this."
Went on river rafting there in June 2018! Blu marine water make place look magical! River rapids quite steep in some places but over quite calm and pleasant
"River rafting in Koprulu Canyon was an amazing experience, especially if one wishes to enjoy adventure, a dip in the river, rafting and enjoy raw scenic beauty. If I visit Turkey  would not hesitate to get the feel again. The scenery is soothing, the water is crisp blue and one feels the tranquility in the ambience. Recommended if you wish to get high on nature!"
"We decided to visit the canyon whilst coming back from Apendos and we were very glad we did, as this ended up being one of the best days of our holiday.On the way its quite funny how reps from the rafting companies keep jumping in front of you for business.Once we had seen the canyon which is beautiful and pristine, we saw many people below rafting so we decided to give it a go. We went with a company called Yayla rafting, the whole trip took three hours and the price included a fish dinner at the end which was great. The reps are right the best way to see the Canyon was to actually be in it. We went as a group of five which included a 6 & 2 year old and we all loved it. The rafting isn't too taxing but the rapids are fun and your rep will stop and give you areas where you can swim (the water is the cleanest, most pristine fresh water you will find). During parts of the rafting you could easily forget you are in Turkey and as the environment is similar to British Columbia. We even stopped at a point where you can climb a tree and jump in the water which was great. Looking back, if you don't do the rafting, driving all that way to see the Canyon isn't really worth it. Overall we took some great photos, saw beautiful views, the kids had a blast and all topped off with a fresh fish dinner looking over the river watching the sunset, and all that for what worked out £20PP!!. If you are the Antalya area it is worth making this trip as you really shouldn't miss it."
"Visited Koprulu Canyon October 2005. This place is simply and stunningly beautiful. The small twisitng winding roads up and through the mountains are a force to be reckoned with but all the while you cant help but take in the scenery and the tiny villages going about their daily life.The white water rafting here is very straight forward and suitable for all the family (except teeny weenys ofcourse!) We rafted with a company called Air-Raft and had a really good day out. Their guides are proffessional and your safety always at heart, yet they have a wicked sense of humour. Even if you are not 'into' scenery you cant help but be in awe as you splash your way down the canyon.Go see it, have a great day."
"Who would have believed Turkey had even more to offer. The scenery along this river is stunning. This trip is full of fun and excitement, we chose to kayak and got regularly attacked by the rafters along the river attempting to fill our kayak with water.......all in great spirit. The leaders running the day are friendly, experienced and full of fun. Lunch is chicken, rice salad and beer or water coke etc. Wear boating shoes or buy the plastic shoes on site, take a waterproof camera although a few pics are taken by the team to purchase after, there's also a video. Wear plenty of sunscreen as you have to leave belongings in the minibus and pay for extras at the end. This is a fantastic day out and the rapids are really exciting!"
Went to visit as part of a rafting excursion.  The scenery once you get of the highway is beautiful. The little villages you drive through are idyllic. The canyon is very scenic. We had a lovely time throughly enjoying and the rafting was one the best adventures we've been on. Our tour operator was wonderful so was our group.
"Visited for a day excursion including a speedboat through the steepest part of the gorge, off-road Jeep Safari & white water rafting. The gorge is absolutely stunning with amazing steep cliff sides and crystal clear aqua water. The river where the rafting took place is also beautiful and when we weren’t screaming through the rapids it was very tranquil with the mountains and forest all around. We have been to this part of Turkey several times but for some reason never visited the canyon before. However, we all agreed it was one of the highlights of the holiday. A definite for adrenaline junkies and for those who want to get away from the coast and see some beautiful scenery.On a separate note - we booked the excursion through TuiGo. The activity centre staff were superb but our trip guide spoke only German, despite half the coach speaking only English and us all requesting an English speaking guide at time if booking. However, the canyon, gorge and surrounding scenery was beautiful and hence the 5 stars for the NationalPark."
"I visited Koprulu Canyon multiple times, and the main reason is river rafting. It would be best described as safe, amazing views, and adventurous. I came across many first timers (including my wife, friends, and tourists) who were reluctant to raft, and I had to provide them with basic advice for better results and experience... My advice is to purchase special rafting shoes (TRY20) and avoid slippers or going barefoot. You could ask the tour bus driver to stop at any shop on your way. Small rocks and pebbles could cause minor injuries. Everyone must wear the floating jacket, although I find it useless because most of the journey you can actually stand while in the water (or if you happened to fall in the water). Most rafting tours provide lunch (dont expect much of quality) and remember the purpose is rafting! You get to jump in the water from 5 meters (only for the brave ones). Water temperature could be between 5 and 9 degrees Celsius in May. Bring some extra clothes and a towel. Dont bring valuables or cameras/electronics. You could leave your bag in the vehicle (generally safe). There are changing rooms available. The entire journey is recorded on video so you might want to buy it at the end. There are also photos taken during your rafting adventure and you get to choose which one to buy. Other activities are also available, trekking, canoe, etc. If you are going to ride a canoe, make sure you are a good (not professional) swimmer and travel in groups."
"Organised via our Thomson Rep, we had an amazing day at the canyon followed by a jeep safari. Took around hour and half from our hotel on Lara beach with couple of pick-ups en-route. Stops at a local mosque, followed by the canyon rafting (ours was with ""Air Raft""), a lovely fresh lunch and jeep safari in the afternoon. Don't worry its not the white water you see in the movies, I would call it a little choppy with most of the splashing coming from the oar fights you have with other boats. For the warm bodied like me, the water seemed freezing, but you do strangely get used to it especially if you jump off the platform. Watch out if you buy the DVD/Photo CD, we did and neither work, luckily we had our own footage from a action camera. Take lots of small notes for tips, drinks were not included in the trip so either stock up from your all inclusive hotel or you can buy for €2. Enjoy its a great day out."
"We hired a car via Pandora Car hire so was very easy for us to get around. We drove to the Kanyon, did a round route of the whole area while making frequent stops on the way. The weather was great and the view was beautiful at all the various points. There are some low points where you can sit with you feet in the water, the water is a bit cold but amazing experience as it's exceptionally clean. Loved the whole experience. There are restaurants and rafting providers on the route round. The road is great so no problems driving around.A must visit - we definitely loved our day trip to here!"
"Really well organised , our guide Mustafa was very engaging and mixed excitement with fun. He was clearly very experienced.   Be warned -  you will go in the river , several times!  And it is cold.  Kids have to be over 15 to sit on the outside and paddle -  this is to keep the safe from being thrown out on The rapid sections.  Lots of opportunities to ""fall in"" or jump from diving platforms at the rest stops.Best to have closed toe shoes or trainer. Don't forget some money for photos, drinks etc. Enjoy it!"
Rafting on Koprulu River is a must have activity for whole family. Before we had some concerns for safety of small children but is perfectly suitable and safe for 7 years ols and children loves it. Guide will adjust level of attraction to the crew on board if there are small children he will take light course to avoid serious obstacles. You will get wet though. There are breaks provided and the meal half way through. Views on surrounding mountains are spectacular and water is Cristal clear.
"Booked with Thomas Cook for the white water rafting, enjoyed every minute of it.  The instructors would good fun and we felt safe after their instruction.  All were given life jackets and helmets.  The lunch which was included  was fine, I did wear flip flops but not ideal, trainers or water shoes are a better option.  We did purchase a photo and DVD at the end as a good keepsake of the day but there was no pressure to buy so up to the individual.  Great value for money and good fun even if you have children."
"Going white water rafting was an amazing experience! I stayed out in turkey from the 9th-23rd July at Pegasus world between Side and Manavagat and decided to do some of the activities in the area. The journey lasted all day, we got the bus at 8:30 arrived down there about 10 as had to pick other people up from different hotels. Free lunch was included and you could buy plenty of drinks there if needed. Top tip- book online as at my hotel Thompson charged £49 and I got it for £16 online, absolute bargain day out! 5 star!"
"We had a great day white water fafting. The mountaing scenery is breathtaking. The price can very so be prepared to haggle. We paid 45TL (£18). This included pick up from hotel and lunch which made it great value. Once in the raft we journey about 15Km down river. Thankfully it's not rapids all the way which gave us a chance to take in the beautiful mountain views. Be warned, the water is very cold. The we're many other inflatable rafts along the route. Be prepared to give and take a soaking from other rafts. There are a few diffrent franchises operating the rafts and although they all provide life jackets and paddles not all of the provide safety helmets."
"What  a wonderful and breathtaking experience. Stopped here for an hour or so and just marveled at the beauty of the natural wonders. The water here is clear but cold, lovely for a brisk dip to cool you down in the height of the season. The Ancient Bridge is a marvel to see."
"Koprulu Canyon is a great river for rafting in Antalya. Flow rate is proper nearly during all the year. You can buy a rafting tour from anywhere in the city, hotel transfer and lunch is included. We gave 30$ per person in summer season! First enjoy the group rafting! Expect for the adventure! If you are not good with cold water jokes, than don't go on! Because there severe water wars with the other boats, there some ""pirate"" instructors who jump one boat to other and choose a victim to throw the river! Of course these are all safe! :S But who knows :D After you've experienced group rafting, later you can hire single lane boats which can be used by alone or two people."
"We did a 2 hour rafting trip as part of an all day trip, combined with jeep safari.This was an excellent day, not to be missed. Excellent instructor/guide on the raft meant we safely navigated our 16 person boat through a series of white water Rapids along this breathtakingly beautiful river in the Antalya province. There were several opportunities to cool off along the way by jumping into the alpine water, I chucked myself over the side. Getting back in the boat is a little more difficult! You will see the mountains and countryside and it is so much fun. Great times. We went with our 9 year old and she loved it. There were 2 non swimmers in our group who joined the rest of us in some body rafting. You jump off the rocks and are carried in the current downstream. You wear life jackets, it is safe."
"I loved my trip with Air Raft, was arranged by our travel agent and was a day trip to include also Jeep Safari and all the rafting equipment, also wetsuit and lunch. All for 79 euro. Fo the DVD another 20 euro, was not mandatory but I am so glad I have it - is the best memory we have, includes our jeep safari experience, some games before lunch and the rafting. Plus pictures, we loved it don't miss it. We got really wet right from the start but didn't felt cold thanks to the wetsuits (take one to really fit you, not to be large). We make some river battles with other boats and had the time of our lives. We even jumped in the river from one platform when we made a break. Ugly recommend if I will come to Antalya again for sure will try this once again.Tip: if you make the trip with Air Raft, from the captains, just to know: Omer is very calm and only takes you a few times close to a rock which is amazing, Jay loves to share impressions about history and show you the area, the mountains, etc and Abdullah, the youngest is to be followed by adrenaline seekers as he made all his team jump in the river more than once (he also took them out of the water, sometimes two at the same time). Everybody loved the experience :)"
Rent a car a drive about 40 min from Belek to the Koprulu national park. reach the roman bridge and take a 50 min paddle boat ride into the canyon. Views are magnificent. It is not walkable. In the winter most attractions are closed but you can find restraunts offering fresh fish and typical food.Had a great day out.
"One of the best activity to do! Definiyely should do! İ come to antalya every summer and rafting didnt seemed an attractive activity to me but when i did i reaaly enjoyed a lot! Beatiful landscape, and it s reaaly fun ! :) i ll take all my friends there! İt s 4 every age! PLEASE DO! Also very cheap for all day activity, included delicious Turkish food!!!"
"Spent two days here in the gorge staying at Selge Ailee pansiyon. Room was basic and clean, plenty of room with air con and en suite. Booked rafting through Selge at TL30 per person! A lot cheaper than other prices quoted and it was an amazing experience. We also got rowed up stream by two guys to see the waterfall, hard work for them on the way up! Got a tour of Selge by a girl who found us looking lost in the mountains which was fantastic. A great place to unwind"
"Well worth a visit. For the adventurous, there's a hairy hike upriver from the bridge. For the less able, the view at the Roman bridge is fine, and there is a nice resting spot at the lower Roman bridge, and a restaurant a little further downstream. Finding a suitable way to get upstream proved impossible. I'm sure this is a ploy by the locals to ensure that one local can guide you for a small fee. I don't blame them for this, but having been led 50 yards or so upstream and then insisting that we did not want to be guided further, it proved difficult to shed our local lad. Eventually he relented, but only after a 5TL payoff. The route is by no means easy, and there is much scrambling. There are only glimpses of the river for long stretches, and there are no safety barriers. But it's worth the effort. The river was in full spate in May, and as with the Aksu Cay and Manavgat Cay, the rivers are full of silt. This gives them that lovely green coppery, verdigris, colouration. The upper falls are a large rapid rather than a waterfall, but that doesn't detract from the scenery. Next time, I'll go rafting, which, sadly, a torn back muscle prevented this time. There are restaurants near the Roman bridge for bites and drinks."
"First of all, you should know that wherever you stay in the Alanya area, there is only one rafting place. In my case, it took 3 hours to get there. Upon arriving at the rest stop near the launch point, one of the guides came on and told us we had to wait while he ate breakfast. He later came on and began his spiel as we traveled to the actual launch point. Now, I know he was trying to be entertaining, but I was traveling with my 11-year-old son. All of the ‘humor’ was about sex and the girls losing their bikinis or rafting naked. This was spiced up with the ubiquitous use of profanity. I was not the only one who had kids along, but, as an American, maybe I was more aware of the discomfort of the situation. Had we all been adults, it wouldn’t have mattered much to me.At the launch preparation site, we were given jackets and helmets I had canoed before and done a long white water trip as well. I asked for a “kayak” (which was actually more like a rubber canoe) for my son and I. I thought the 8 person rafts to be more on the order of riding a sofa down the river. However, they refused to give me a normal paddle, insisting that I use the double-ended kayak paddle which I was totally unfamiliar with. Nonetheless, I was pushed onto the river with no recourse. Now, if you’re expecting a quiet trip through a natural area, forget it. There were hundreds of rafts and ‘kayaks’ at the launch site. Guides began yelling at me to go and then to not go as I tried to figure out how to use the kayak paddle. The first rapid you go over is right at the beginning. It is the most difficult rapid on the river and is called ‘the waterfall’ for good reason. With the new paddle and a son who had never been on a canoe in any river before, I barely survived it. I then realized that I had one goal: to survive going down this river without causing any harm to my son. It no longer seemed like a fun trip. After the waterfall, you are corralled onto a beach and told to follow your guide. You are then commanded to stand in a line, holding onto the life jacket of the person in front of you. I finally realized this is for the $35 cd they will try to sell you at the end of the trip. All the while, the guide kept yelling at us to “shake your ...”. None of us did. We were then led to a small waterfall where our pictures were taken, yes, to be sold to you later for $10. Then we were told to hold onto the life jackets of the person in front of us and told to wade through a deep mountain stream. The water was over our heads and I began to see the person in front of me going underwater. I felt my son trying to climb up on my back. I let go of the woman and began to swim to the opposite shore despite the guide yelling at us all not to let go. The water was quite cold and some of us were shivering on the opposite bank. The guide, then, jumped off a bridge into the river to entertain us. Unfortunately, he survived the plunge.Upon the river again, we were continuously screamed at to go faster or slower. You should also realize that the highest form of humor here is to splash other people with water. Whenever I heard the cry, “hey, kayak” from one of the guides, I realized it meant that when I turned I would get a face full of river water with the guide laughing hysterically. As I said, all I wanted to do was to survive the trip with my son. I accepted the fact that I would be routinely hit with water. However, one time when I did not turn my head to the “hey kayak” call, the disgruntled guard struck me over the head with his paddle. That was the last straw and I told him that when we got to shore I would have a few words with him (this is a paraphrase of what I actually said). Realizing that he had overstepped his bounds, he apologized; however, the damage was done. To all women thinking of taking this tour, be forewarned that you will be pushed off the raft at some point. Yes, this is considered as hilarious. The younger and more attractive you are, the more you will be the target for various forms of abuse. At one point you will stop and be told to climb a 3 meter platform and jump in the river, whether you want to or not (don’t forget they are making a cd). If you happen to be an attractive young woman, you will be picked up, carried to the platform, and thrown in. I realize that those traveling in the big rafts will have an entirely different experience as there is really no danger involved, unless you cannot swim when the guide pushes you off the raft. It’s too bad. If you were allowed to travel at your own pace without the guides, this could be an enjoyable experience. As it was, I was happy to be done with it and to get back to my hotel. No, I did not buy the cd."
"We booked this adventure via our Travel Rep for €23pp (two adults). Depending on the location of your hotel, it can be a long drive; apprx 40mins from when you leave Side city, but be sure that the bus will stop for a 15min ""refreshment"" break along the way. Arriving can be a little chaotic as rafters are coming in while others are leaving and you're not given too much instruction on where to go/what to do, but it is well-worth the commotion as it kind of adds to the excitement. Once you have your life jacket, paddle and helmet, you will drive another 10 mins to the launching point where they will sort you into groups of 10 (families are kept together). The beginning starts with a small-medium rapid, which gets the heart pounding! Then you will have some nice quiet pauses, which often leads to a splash war with the other rafters. Then, should you choose to enter the ice-cold water, you can take a little swim. You will soak in some beautiful nature whilst paddling your arms off to the sounds of cheers, laughs and adrenaline filled gasps. I highly recommend bringing some bottled water and sunscreen, as you will be out under the sun for roughly 3-4hrs."
"Loved it, could hav don this every day of our holiday. Raftin was great, will def do it again. Beautiful place"
"This is great fun. Have done this twice and I'm 66 years old, my Husband has done this 3 times and he is now 76 years old. we went with Prestige Rafting and have had no problems with them. My husband went with them again in 2018 and some of the lads recognised him. When we are in Side this year, I might go rafting again, but it depends on how my knees bear up. Great outfit Prestige Rafting. Thanks Mustafa!!!"
