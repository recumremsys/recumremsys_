Beautiful and vast national park.  Felt like I was in the Flintstones with the jumbo rock formations.  Joshua Trees are unique and cool.  Cholla Cactus garden and Barker Dam hikes easy for all levels and amazing. Keys at sunset is the best.  Park is magical at twilight.
"Well spent day. Incredible rock formations, pictoresque Joshua trees. Visited in November and was still quite hot. Snacks, sunscreen and water supplies are must.  Can´t imagine visit in real summertime."
Loved this Park.  Everywhere you look a new Scenic View.  Must sees are the Cactus Gardens and the Rock Formation all over the Park.  Joshua Trees everywhere so get lots of pictures because you find these anywhere in the US.  Rangers do a great job keeping this Park pristine.
"Such a unique and special place, amazing raw natural beauty.  We learned so much about desert life.  The pictures don’t do it justice.  There are plenty of fun activities for all skill and activity levels.  Go and see it for yourself."
"Beautiful trails and beautiful national parking for hiking. Had an amazing, relaxing day with my buddies"
"Spectacular scenery, stunning vistas, informative rangers;  everything you want in a park.  A must for a Palm Springs trip.  Keys View was well worth the drive to get there.  We entered via 29 Palms and exited via Cottonwood.  It was a beautiful drive and we were lucky to view a “superbloom” of desert flowers after a rainy winter.  Took a very informative ranger walk at Cap Rock, too."
"Took our 2 young daughters while on holiday in Palm Springs.Amazing geology and wildlife. Took a drive around the park after visiting the information centre. Our daughters loved doing the free activity book, spotting wildlife, plants, trees, cactus and learning more. We parked up several times and walked around. While it is well visited we never bumped into many other people. There were lots of Jack rabbits and squirrels and hundreds of tarantula burrows everywhere!On the way home we visited the Cotton Woods visited centre and our daughters handed in their completed activity book and became junior rangers, they absolutely loved it. We also learned the history of the geology which was really interesting. Definately worth a visit. We returned on another visit to see the dark skies, had a fab view of the mikly way, wish I had a better camera!!"
"We were blown away by the vegetation and the rock formations. Don’t miss the cactus garden or Barker Dam. We went up to Key View and were excited to see the San Andreas fault, but the wind was too strong and cold (late December) that we didn’t stay. Indian cove was interesting as well."
Beautiful vistas. So much more than I expected. You never get tired of seeing rocks and Joshua trees.  Make sure you hike around and over the boulders. If you use the twenty nine palms entrance there’s no lines and the visitor center is nicer and less crowded than the one in Joshua Tree.
Loved this park. The trees are amazing! Went hiking with the kids and the visitor center was helpful in determining which trails to check out to see the best sites and weren't too crazy for us not so fit bunch hehe.
"I had an amazing time around park and its surrounding. It looks like you're inside a movie, every single aspect of the different scenery this park has is just breathtaking and full of history behind. Make sure to bring with you plenty of water and comfortable clothes to spend a nice time inside the park!"
"Must see National Park!  Looked like God decided to have a rain storm of rocks and boulders.  As they clustered around the park in amazing formations, hills and mixed in with the beauty of the desert gardens.  Who know cactus could be so unique and beautiful"
"Joshua Tree Park is a most diverse place of organic boulders, nature paths, cacti gardens, textured landscapes and of course Joshua Trees that look like something out of a Dr.. Seuss book.  I’ve actually visited the park three times in the last 3 months. January and March experienced light snow which added interest interest to the scenery. February weather was a bright sunny day with blue skies. It is quite beautiful when there’s no one else around - where you can enjoy the solitude of the nature.There are two visitor centers at different ends of the park. We personally prefer the cotton wood entrance.  The main roads are well paved and the dirt secondary roads were fine even though we didn’t have 4 wheel drive. Speed levels are slow so animals are protected and you can travel and see the sights.  If you plan on returning multiple times then you may want to consider the different passes which are offered. I have a senior’s pass with no expiration that allows the driver and 3 passengers free entry. This pass is good at any US National Park. You don’t have to show the pass upon entry, but when exiting you do have to show the pass and another piece of secondary ID. It’s all based on the honour system.On the days when it snowed the night before there was traffic. It was congested on the weekend at the entrances and no line ups during the week. On the sunny weekday there was very little traffic. Overall this national park has well designated, natural settings with small parking lots. Campgrounds are small and not too close together. There were a few sightings of birds, hares and other small desert animals. Apparently there are desert tortoises so take care when driving not to hurt them.I understand the sunrises and sunsets are just stunning so check the times. Stargazing is highly rated and there are many photo opportunities. However, the summers exceed 100F so it’s probably best to check the temperature forecasts. It is definitely cooler at higher elevations (and sometimes very windy) so dress in layers, have a hood or toque, and bring at least a SPF 30 sunscreen. Certain companies offer 2 day photo outings as well as other overnight tours which can easily be found on the internet."
The rock formations and the Joshua Trees make this one of the most special places in the USA. The blue skies are super blue and the contrast with the wilderness makes for lots of picture perfect scenes.  Make sure this is on your Bucket List.
Traveled for Joshua Tree from Phoenix for a day trip.  It is an amazing park with lots to do.  Could definitely spend several days here.  The drive from the south entrance to the northwest entrance is approximately 53 miles.  The entire park is amazing but the northwest section is high desert with amazing scenery.
Had a few fun days at JT. Climbed the Astro Dome in the Wonderlands and got thru the Chasm of Doom(really cool!!)   Not too crowded over a holiday weekend.
"Loved the diverse scenery. Thought it might just be ""desert scrub"" but was pleasantly surprised. Staff at the Cottonwood ranger station were knowledgeable and very helpful.  Glad we decided to visit!"
Windflowers galore in February. Worth checking out.  Drove through the park from the South cottonwood entrance to the west Joshua Tree entrance and stopped at several exhibits and short hikes along the way.  Pine City hike is the only one I would skip next time.  Very nice cause there was no crowd at the south entrance to get in.  Was a great day-trip.  Loved the cactus garden and Octillo patch.
"Took the long way from Palm Springs to 29 Palms, driving through the park.  Some amazing sights included the cactus plants, the mountains, the outcroppings of rock and boulder formations as well as the Joshua trees."
The only place you can see many Joshua trees and cholla cactus in such a beautiful land. About 2 hours driving from Los Angeles. The landscape is so fantastic. Be careful when you take a walk into the cactus bushes. They can really hurt.
Wonderful spot for a day trip or camping .  Many different venues and you’ll marvel at the scenes. Not busy the day we drove through. Went from the South entrance to the North.
"First time going to the desert and it blew my mind! Landscape is breathtaking and the sound of silence will give you some peace to your soul! Sunsets are a must if you are visiting, probably one of the best sunsets I’ve seen: I stoped in one of the main resting areas and climbed my way up in one of the big rocks! Had a awesome and unique view!"
"Visited this NP whilst in Palm Springs for a few days.It is the most amazing place, other-worldly! The scenery goes from flat desert plain to huge boulders and mountains, some 60 miles of it, with cacti and amazing Joshua Tree’s.We went midday and spent the afternoon there, very few visitors around so plenty of parking for scenic views.We had been told that to go at night is good as the stars put on a spectacular show, unfortunately we didn’t have time for a repeat visit.Highly recommend."
"What a beautiful landscape made by nature!!! The chollo cactus garden was a great little stop off driving through the park.  Don't be in a hurry and enjoy the stunning views!! There's hiking, rock climbing and camping available. Early spring when the wildflowers are in bloom is especially beautiful."
"Incredible natural desert with the iconic amazing Joshua trees. Can check out all the main points on the map in the main park loop in one day. we drove from palm springs and arrived at west entrance at appx 12 pm, snacked at quail picnic area, took a short hike to barker dam, but due to heat was difficult especially for our little kids. we then drove to keys view which is a must see, we then went to the jumbo rocks/skull rock, another must see which little kids love, then drove out to visitor center in twenty nine palms ( the rangers were super helpful with info and recommendations) and to visit that and oasis of Mara, drove back into the park, had a supper at live oak picnic area, then drove down towards cottonwood springs and stopped at the cholla cactus garden which is also a must see at dusk, there were a lot of bees there though, then we visited cottonwood springs trail around sunset time and saw some wildlife there, a number of rabbits and even a what looked like a fox or coyote crossing the road. we got out of the car after sunset and viewed the dark skies with the natural lights of the stars popping out to finish the experience, which is another recommended thing to see. All in one day! only problem is that it was in august so it was very very hot. stay cool in your car between stops made it tolerable for a once in a lifetime experience!"
"Surrounded by desert, cactus and rock formations, Joshua Tree National Park is a great open space to pause and reflect and admire the scenery. The drive through the park takes about an a hour or so non stop but there are plenty of stopping points to see different aspects of the park. From cactus gardens to Skull Rock and plenty of camping areas, Joshua Tree is cool to spend a night in staring at the billion of stars on a clear summer evening."
"You come to Joshua Tree to connect with eons of geologic time. Ancient rocks, unique trees and the full expanse of the high desert. If you just drive through then you will most likely yawn and head off to the rancid interior of a casino or the plastic of a strip mall.So, stop. Walk to one of the massive rock piles. With as the rocks become higher and higher, towering over you, often as smooth as cream, gold against the blue sky. The quietness will envelop you, and ask you to stay.The rocks will call out to be climbed. And the smoother rocks will be easy for almost any age. The higher ones will challenge the professional climber.Make sure to walk on the rocks. Sit at the top, or as high as you dare, and look around. The Joshua Tree forest (yes, technically that is correct) is unique, wonderful and under huge environmental stress.Stay after the sun sets and watch the sky fill with millions of stars.After a few days in the high desert the rest of life will shift into the correct perspective. There is heart in this place, ancient heart, beating very slowly, deep time and you will need to be still and quiet to hear its beat."
"Joshua Tree is a huge, stunningly beautiful park of impressive rock formations. Hiking can be challenging, in more than one way, but much can be seen from your car if you choose to drive through.  Being from Minnesota, I was not familiar with the Cholla cactus, known as the “jumper”.  We got out of our car to walk through a “cactus garden” that consisted of hundreds of cactus, mostly chollas.  If you come near these plants, barely grazing them, the balls of spines will attach to you. It does not seem like you really even have to touch the things. Unless equipped with heavy leather gloves or a large tongs or pliers, you will not be able to remove these fellows.  At 4:30 p.m., the nearest ranger station was closed when we arrived so we had to head for the interstate to get cell service.  911 directed us to the nearest ER.  The ball was attached to one finger with about 15 or so spines embedded in one finger.  Each spine is barbed, like a fish hook. Removing them required quite the procedure.  The tech doing the removal said that the towel under my hand should be burned to prevent anyone else touching the thing because it would “jump” again.  At least they are not poisonous.  Beautiful, but hostile area. Just be careful!"
"The terrain is just breathtakingly beautiful.   Rock formations and the the joshua trees- are a sight to see.  We went during an extremely hot day so be sure to take plenty of water.  This was a day trip for us and if you enter via the south entrance, we aware that the Joshua Trees are not visible for a 45 mins drive into the park.  Be sure to bring a hat, sunblock and good walking shoes."
Joshua Tree NP never disappoints! A place where the Colorado and Mohave Deserts meet! Awesome rock formations and of course the ancient Joshua Tree! Recommend to enter from the south as the park visitation has quadrupled in last few uears
"We visited during spring break. Did a drive through trip. Started at Oasis Visitors Center and sat in on a Ranger Talk on Desert Tortoises. Then drove to Cholla Cactus Garden in Colorado Desert. Then back to Mojave Desert to see Skull rock, Jumbo rocks and Keys View. Exited at Western Visitor’s center.Saw some beautiful flowers - yellow, white, orange, pink, purple, red. Also we saw a jack rabbit, couple of desert rats, lizards, ravens and a couple of birds.The entry pass for the car is valid for a week. We should have done a night trip to see the stars but didn’t."
Its an amazing place . To see the boulder formations was incredible . I never knew there were so many types of cactus plants. We hiked and had lunch in the park three different days. There is so much to see . Talking with park rangers was very informative . We got home last week and learned the park is CLOSED today . How lucky we were to get to visit the park
"This is an interesting huge park but may be disappointing to those expecting something like Yosemite or other woodsy type parks. Remember, this is desert terrain. The Joshua trees are all in the northern part of the park as is most of the interesting sites. As you head south towards I-10 it becomes increasingly barren. We spent about three hours driving through this park and stopping at accessible spots. Obviously, if you want to explore the various hiking trails you could spend all day or many days. It was beautiful and cool when we were there in mid Oct. midday high only reached low 70’s. But clearly it can get extremely hot in summer. Overall, a nice and strikingly different National Park well worth a visit."
"We are avid trail runners & we loved loved loved running through Joshua Tree National Park. A tip straight up... go early, even earlier than the 8am park opening time. We thought we could only go at 8am but when we got there realised that there is no boom gate (& no ranger) & some locals told us you can pay on your way out. So off we drove to find a trail to run. We ran the Willow Hole trail (starting on the Boy Scout trail) & it was great. It is reasonably flat, a slight ascent in parts. Amazing scenery & not too hot. Definitely take water & maybe some food if you are walking. Looking forward to coming back & running some more trails in the area."
What a beautiful place. Never seen anything like this before apart from TV. Went over from south to north around 4.30 in the afternoon and took around 2 hours to cross with a few stops. Cactus gardens were interesting along with curious rock formations. Hundreds of Joshua trees in northern part of park. Would visit again if had more time to explore
