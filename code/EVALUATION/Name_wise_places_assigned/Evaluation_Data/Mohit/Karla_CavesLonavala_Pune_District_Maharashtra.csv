"It is a must visit place close to Lonavala. It is nestled on a hilltop and there are quite a few steps to climb. It is a two in one purpose climb , also covering the holy shrine of Ekvira temple. The caves date to one century BC. They have been built by combined efforts of Buddhists and Jains. The architechture of the main hall is awesome. Do take a guide with you, if you want to understand the historical details, otherwise you will not understand anything. If you are fit to climb don’t miss it"
This place is near Lonavala and is located on a height. You have to climb stairs to get to the top. It is a refreshing place with an ancient Ekvira Devi temple in the vicinity. The caves are not in a good condition and i don't think it is even worth 25 rs that you pay for admission. There is no sanitation or drinking water facility around. The toilets at the foothill near the parking area were stinking with no water in tap. Parking area is poorly maintained. Even the road leading to parking area is poorly maintained. This is when there is no dearth of money as Ekvira Devi temple gets ample donation from devotees.
"Situated on old Mumbai Pune Highway, these Caves are a nice stopover and a religious abode. Housing the Ekvira devi temple, this hill has proper stairs lined with lots of shops selling various Pooja सामग्री and sweets. The stairs have handrails for support so the elderly devotees can make it to the top as well.In rains you can see a beautiful waterfall right as you reach the top. Caves have Buddhist history andcan be visted at a fee of 25 Rs. The birds eye view of the city is another attraction."
"At Karla caves, there are two points one is caves itself and another is Maa Elvira Temple. Caves entry closing time is 5 pm. There are about 150 stairs to reach at the caves and the temple. Enjoyed Sunset at the Karla hill."
People who love to explore must visit. These are old caves. Linked with buddhist monks. Exact description as we use to find in history books. I really loved visiting it.
"Karla  Caves was the first  stop in our Lonavala trip and was so worth it ! There are a lot of steps to climb to reach the top  which takes some time and effort.  When we went ,there was some festival happening there and lot of local crowd had come .On the top  , there is some local temple near the cave entrance and there was long queue to get in . But the cave itself is a historic site and can be entered easily (no queue n all ) .   Coming to the actual caves , these are 6-7 th  century Budhist rock cut caves with one impressive central hall , and many nearby viharas . I felt the lack of proper trained ASI guides to give more info about the site .Authorities should take better care of this amazing site.  Must visit if you are into ancient Indian history.25 RS per head entry fee."
"Karla is a village about 11km from Lonavala station, 2km off Old Pune-Mumbai highway and rickshaws or cabs will take you there. Caves are located on hilltop and your vehicle can arrive either at base of the hill or the upper parking. From base it is a climb of 350 stony steps, or about 150 steps from upper parking. Better to start from base if you want to enjoy the views, water streams, and the climb itself. My yound kids also were able to make the climb easily. Try to start climb early, by 9am or so, to avoid crowds. Wear good grip footwear and be prepared to walk through water streams at some steps. There are lot of vendor shops along upper steps selling offerings for the Ekvira temple, and also snacks. Keep in mind most visitors are not coming to visit the caves, rather are devotees going to temple which is right in front of the main cave. They are mostly from fishermen community. When you reach the top there is a ticket office for cave entry, pay Rs25 per adult, kids go free. Adjacent the caves there's a beautiful water fall (alive atleast during monsoon). Then there are rock cut hermitages. And then the main cave itself dedicated to Lord Buddha, the stupa inside is believed to contain some ashes of Buddha's own remains. The security guard will double up as guide if you wish, for a small tip. Getting guidance is highly recommended, else one won't make much sense of the visit, will just click some pics and return without getting to know much. Carvings are brilliant, so is the remaining Ashoka pillar. The other pillar had to go as the Ekvira temple was built in its place. It's sad to see goat/chicken sacrifices are made in the temple built right in front of the caves which have carvings of Lord Buddha and Lord Mahavir, who were some of the biggest proponents of nonviolence. Believed to be constructed by Pandavas (but in reality built much after the caves were built), the temple appears to be uncharacteristic of this originally Buddhist site. The caves though, fortunately are now managed and protected by ASI. It's a must visit for tourists going to Lonavala. It's little distant from other popular spots like Khandala, bhushi dam or Lions point etc, but certainly worth a visit. The climb, visit and descent altogether can take 2 to 2.5 hours."
"We were in Lonavala and wanted to head to the Karla caves.  Being adventurous, we took an auto rickshaw (the most modern we could find) and roared up to the caves.  The ride up was half the fun of the trip to the caves.  It is worth doing if fit as there are some 200 plus steps up and down.  There are places to stop for food and drink on the way and also many stores with religious bits and pieces.  The caves are stunning.  The whole temple is carved from the hill side.  Worth a visit."
"The cave was built around 120 AD, therefore, interesting to see the sculpture of those times. Has a climb of around 250 steps, which can be fun if you are physically active and a pain otherwise. Go there if these two are of interest to you. Also, the cave has just one hall where you can see the exquisite sculpture."
"A wonderful structure of massive rock carved sculptures in caves on a mountain. It takes less than half an hour climb from parking area on a tile paved narrow path. Amazingly beautiful carvings of more than life sized elephants, men & women etc. The main cave has one of the largest prayer hall with a series of columns with superb carvings on top. Other caves are small and a few are closed for entry. Ekvira Devi temple is adjoining to the main cave. This invaluable treasure could be preserved & maintained better. Reaching this place could be challenging in view of poor sign boards en route. A must visit monument."
The way up to the caves is steep but lined with little shops. All worth it at the top ! Caves are just the one but what a terrific cave it is !! Like a hallway of kings form a long long time ago. The temple itself is not a must but go if you want to partake of the rustic adulation and ritual of the fisherfolk who go there to appease the goddess. We saw a goat being taken up with a bunch of villagers who were to sacrifice it after showing her to the goddess. Tourists are mere onlookers on a very alive ritualistic place. Felt very rejuvenated.
Going to see 2000 year old caves was exciting prospect but we underestimated the climb a little. There is a road that takes you halfway up the climb so you can go by car to that point but if you go when there are lot of people then the police may not allow. We happened to go during Navratri and since there is Ekvira devi temple next to the caves there were lots of people. But since we had a senior citizen with us they allowed our car to the halfway point. The climb from that point is quite steep. But there are shops on the way to take your mind off to climb. Once you reach the top you are amazed by the structure. Nominal ticket price. Though the structure is beautiful it hasn't been maintained well. People have vandalized it over the centuries. But the peace you find is astounding. Though it was warm outside the caves were cool.Since it was Navratri time there was a lot of rush for the temple hence we couldn't go inside. So next time temple for sure.
