Was in Ahmedabad this December and as suggested by locals paid visit to this beautiful lake in the evening and was well worth it. It definitely looks much better with the lights on and they also probably have a light and sound show at 7. Highlight of the trip was the flock of birds flying above the lake in sync with each other. Best time to visit is around 5 and stay there as late as u want.
A must visit lace in Ahmedabad. Children enjoy the most with toy train ride. Boating in lake. Different eatries in place but of course cleaniness matters.Evening are very pleasant.
One of the major cultural and historical heritage with entertainment hub in Ahmedabad. Suggested for Morning Walk and family enjoyment.
"If u r in Ahmedabad , you canâ€™t forget to visit Kankaria lake . The place where every activity is added for each generation , teenagers can take segaway rides and thrilling tree walks , where as small children can take chuk chuk train ride. Boating for every age . Where as adults or elder can take stroll on the sides of lake . No of eating joints for girls and ladies. Clean waters of lake refreshes you up."
Evening walk with family is simply outstanding do try chatpata. Clean and try train ride kids will love it.
"This is a lake in the middle of the city, kinda unique site to see or drive by during your visit. Offers a respite from all the traffic and hustle bustle."
"This is one of the lakes in Ahmedabad, located in the southern part of the city. The lake was completed many centuries ago and the name is mainly derived from kankar (limestone) which was found aplenty at the time of excavation of the lake.In the past one decade, a nice lakefront has been developed which offers various attractions for kids (small) like the zoo & the amusement park , nice time pass for adults and elders. We had visited the place previously during the Kankaria festival which occurs in December and when various cultural performances and arts etc. take place.The lake is open till 9 pm in the night. Overall a nice family place to spend the evening."
"It is a circular lake in Old part of the city. There is a small toy train which runs around the lake must ride when visiting with kids. has few restaurants, and play areas around for kids."
"Living in Ahmedabad since 3 years got chance to visit this place for the first time. Street food inside lake premise is awarded as best and cleaned place in india. Cost of ticket is 25 â‚¹ Pp , mostly crowded on weekends. U can enjoy speed boating, street food , cycling, visit zoo, have coffee at cafe , enjoy toy train . Meanwhile u can enjoy hot air ballon also. I will give this place 5 ratings because this is one of the best and happenings place in Ahmedabad. #If u visit this please keep it clean always"

Looks beautiful in evening lights.Amazing enjoying with family and Children can spare time in zoo, enjoy water ride etc"
"Went to this place which had plenty of attractions like the zoo, nocturnal zoo, toy train ride, Haunted House, speed boat and many other activities and it was truly a fun-filled experience. Highly recommended for family with kids."
"Lovely place to hang out with kids. Particularly during the winter. Has a little amusement park where for a small fixed sum you get rides and food. Has a toy train that kids will love. The lake is beautiful. The zoo, reptile house etc is educational and fun as well."
"It is ahmedabad main attraction, clean water and well maintained by the gujarat government. see the mirror show"
"It has everything, a zoo, a train, a small aquarium, a small amusement park, boating, eatery shops like mini Juhu, in short a picnic spot. Gets too crowded on a weekend as almost every other local person is here! I found cleanliness an issue here too. Other wise place is good if you can manage to walk around somewhere 5 to 7 KM's on foot."
"Visited lake after 10yrs. Some good development on enclosing the lake with gates. More information and direction needed on the roads. Don't try food near gate no 3. Very high price, poor quality food. Can't imagine it's in Abad. Doesn't suit Abad for its foodie culture."
"Situated bang in the center of the city, it is a huge oasis for you to spend a relaxed evening and gaze at the sunset. Full of activities including a toy train, games, food, rides, and lots more for people of all ages. A must-visit for all those traveling to Ahmedabad."
"visited this place during our Gujrat trip, alogn with kids. They just loved the place. Nearly all the cities have one lake but Karnavati is lucky to have it so well beautified."
"it has zoo, train, amusement activity, fountain show, food, boat riding, motor boating and much more... do visit with kids and family. you will certainly enjoy. wear good footware and be in a confortable clothing. nice place to visit and spend a day."
"A must visit for families. Though the boating staff is very rude a and charges 130/person for a 2 minutes useless ride. Rest everything is cool. train rides, zoo, swings and all for kids. Food stalls too are everywhere and at a very reasonable charges. You can easily spend a full day here. Tickets cost: 13/adult and 7 for child."
"Amazing place to be in. Has a zoo as well. In the evenings, you could also visit the amusement park here. Top trains are an attraction.Good for a one day picnic.."
"visited with family in dec 2018... you need a whole day for the visit. we did the train ride, bubble boat and speed boat. amazng place for food and merriment"
"Not many people will find this place interesting. But it's not bad either. The nocturnal zoo in Kankaria is the best place to visit. Go in the eve, eat, roam, sit near the lake and spend 2 hours. If you visit the zoo you may need more time."
We had visited their last sunday. Had a great fun. Please visit the kankaria zoo. Also suggest you not to miss speed boating.
A little too chaotic place but is a fun. Wait for a long queue for a train ride is definitely worth it
Well within city limits. Lot is small things to see. Rides for children and adults available. Boating also available. Eating joints are there . Include when you are in town. Mini zoo is also there.
"Was a nice experience to travel and sight seeing . There are many things to do within the premises which include boating , butterfly park , various food stalls around offering tasty street food and an ideal place for the kids too ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ"
It was a very nice place to visit. Enjoyed the train ride and boat ride. No digital payment for purchasing the train ride tickets. People will have to buy the tickets with cash only.Boat ride digital payment was accepted
Great place. Nice place to spend time. So many activities to do. Take a speed boat ride and it is cheap. You can take a slow boat ride. Train ride is great. Butterfly park is good. Zorball ride. Lot of eateries and street food. Lighting was very good including lighting show. Very nice for long romantic walk. Very clean well maintained. Toilets are adequate and frequently available. People are helpful and good. Evening visit was very pleasant with all of bird chirping due to lights but return to hotel was little difficult after 8.30 pm due to difficulty in finding ride. Overall experience was good.
Try to visit at night and entry fee is also very nominal. Must do train ride but don't eat inside it's pathetic.
