"What a great experience! The climb to the top does make few muscles to feel the burn, but the views you have to see for yourself. Sitting on the top of Barbant, birds are flying beneath you, it is truly spectacular!Our guide Henri made sure everyone is happy all the way up, going at the pace to suit everyone in our group, giving us helpful tips to the less experienced hikers on how to manage certain areas a bit easier.You have to be relatively fit to make it all the way to the top. Good views before the tougher climb too, so even if you don't reach the top, it is still well worth the go. In places nearer the top, you do need to be able to support your weight with your upper body as well as stepping up, to hoist yourself over some of the rocks. This would not be easy for the couch potato kind folks.I don't have a good head for heights, but didn't get vertigo at any point, despite the heights you get to and when looking down on the views.Bring 1L of water per person, water will be offered to you to take in your bag by the guides at the starting point if you didn't bring enough. Energy bar, sugar source, apple or whatever fuel of your choice would be a good idea to bring too. Most important, wear good shoes for the job. Go for it and enjoy it!"
Booked this with yanature and was a great tour. The views from the top are stunning and the hike/climb is challenging enough that you feel like you achieved something great when reaching the top.
Hiking le morne brabant was a great achievement. You need a good guide who knows the path well as it gets very steep near the top.One needs to be fit and wear good shoes for this climb.
"Hiking at Le Morne is easy anyone and do it, but getting to the top that is really something else. If you can make it to the top you will not be disappointed by the breathtaking view your eyes will catch."
Climbing this heritage of Mauritius was an honour and the view at the very top is amazingly breath taking.  i highly recommend people to go there at least once in their life.
"The climb has the perfect balance of fun and challenges along the way, we certainly enjoyed it very much. We climbed with my 7 month old baby in a carrier and we had the best time! Wear appropriate shoes, take water and sunscreen."
"The area and views are fantastic, and the climb to the cross is worth it.  The climb to the top is not difficult, you just need to be careful.  I would rate it a challenging beginner.   Wear shoes with adequate ankle support and gloves for your hands.  The top at the cross gets windy in the afternoon. If you have trouble with balance or heights, do not attempt the climb.  On my climb, I have seen native mauritian teenagers do the climb barefoot and navigate the rocks like graceful mountain goats. Do not attempt to replicate their feats."
"Le morne brabant...worlds end, stunning place with an incredible view.  The climb is quite rough so be prepared. Carry plenty of water and make sure to wear good hiking shoes.All the look out are out of this world.  Heaven was truly copied after mauritius was created:)"
"Climbing this mountain is a fantastic experience - not only are the views awesome, but the sense of achievement is a great feeling. Regarding the difficulty - here is my take on it:- I am not very fit - i would be classed as average fit in some countries, and certainly below average in other countries like Netherlands etc. - I found that the climbing did not test me physically much - at no point did i struggle with the strength or stamina needed to climb - partly as the guides mostly are happy to wait and take breaks. - What was difficult was how treacherous the rocks are to climb in the steep areas - you need to be careful about where to put your feet, and often ignore the fact that you are pretty high up a steep, 70 degree wall. - Towards the top, some of the paths are narrow - someone suffering from vertigo may struggle with some of this, but not a problem for others. - Go with a guide - you can do it without but with the steepness and complexity of the rocks, i would go with a guide, atleast the first time. - Make sure you have good grippy shoes for this - i had them and climbing up teh steep rocks was significantly more comfortable with them. So all in all, unless you are pretty unfit, u wont be stretched physically - you will however be stretched mentally and with your balance and stability as you climb up the rock portions. Absolutely worth a try though - if you cannot do it, you can always turn down and wait for the guide at the previous waiting point."
ask Allan to take you on a hike up le morne Brabant. it was challenging but well worth the views from the top.  Take hiking boots - trainers are slippery as we encountered a few times.  Something very worthwhile doing.
"It’s a great hike for people who are experienced in steep and technically-challenging hike. I would compare it to the Skeleton Gorge trail up Table Mountain in Cape Town, so a medium-to-difficult level hike. Don’t do it if you’re an inexperienced hiker, it’s not a inclined stroll. The first part is easy, but once you get to the signpost warning of dangerous terrain ahead, it becomes much more difficult. You can still stop there and still get a good view, it’s worth it."
"What a climb and what a view. Great experience and quite a physical one as well. Went up two times and both had its own charm. But remember to bring a lot of water, you will need it."
"I am not going to write how amazing hike it is and how spectacular view is from the top - there are plenty of other people assuring you of that.  Instead, I will tell you briefly how to get there.  As my boyfriend and I stayed in the hotel up north, it was difficult for us to get to the peninsula early in the morning  to do it with the guide.  We arrived around midday.  As you drive around the peninsula take a turn into unpaved road to horse riding centre.  Pass the centre and carry on driving for about 1 km still on unpaved road till you see the red arrow on one of the trees on your left.  That's the place to start.  You will see the gate.  Cross it over.  Walk. Gate.  Cross it over.  Turn left into the wood.  Follow the trail- it's quite easy to see it. Use your common sense if there is a fork on the road.  You will pass one more gate but there will be the ladder to cross it. The trail  at first is through the meadow. It changes later into more difficult to alter completely into climbing almost upright.  Don't be put off.  We managed to get there and we have never done anything like that before. The finish point is were the metal cross is located.  Comfortable shoes,  lots of water is a must. It took us 5 hours to climb, rest, take photos and get back to the red arrow.  Do not park your car by the first gate after passing the red arrow.  Park it close to the surf kiting site and walk from there.  I know I wrote to  drive for 1 km but forgot to mention one thing. If you are going without the guide, you don't pay anything to anyone.  Some people will not be happy about it.  We found our car with the two wheels without the air.  We changed one wheel and  the second one was pumped at horse riding centre.  We were lucky it was open and people  helped us. Fortunately the "" bad guys "" were kind enough just to deflate the tyre note to damaged it. ☺☺☺ overall - fantastic experience ☺☺☺"
"Climbing LE MORNE is an experience that is hard to put into words. You are in a beautiful environment and, when you reach the top, you feel incredible with the unbelivable view of Mauritius."
"A picture says more than 100 words. It was not an easy climb but with a positive attitude, you will nail it! The view on the top of the mountain is breathtakingly gorgeous and we had a great time learning all the new plants our guide showed us. I can not recommend it enough. Climbing with a guide is a must on your to do list if you are in this area. A tip: use both hands and feet for the second part of climbing!"
"One of the best things you should do in Mauritius. The hike up is relatively challenging at an intermediate level. It is split into 2 parts. A generally uphill dirt road with some signboards and arrows along the way which ends at a shelter for rest and then a short walk up to a green gate which is locked. Just go around it and there’s a small path upwards. From then on, it is a lot of instinct and common sense as there is no clear path most of the time. You would have to use your hands to climb as well. There will be walking around cliffs too. For leisure hikers, stop at the shelter. You get a pretty decent viewpoint from there too. Many families bring their kids up to that point. For the more adventurous, go to the summit. It takes around 3 hours up and down. Definitely a must try in Mauritius to get a complete view of the island. Let the photos speak for itself."
"We had a great hike to Le Morne with fantastic views from the top! Yan (http://www.trekkingilemaurice.com/eng/) has been granted an exclusive access to this UNESCO World Heritage-listed site -as the trails are leading through private properties. Le Morne Brabant is a beautiful place with a sad history - don't forget to visit the Monument after the hike. The hike starts 6am as it gets hot very quickly (the hike takes approx 3hours in total) . Bring plenty of water and some snacks - and hiking boots/trainers- will make your climb much easier! Although i saw people climbing in flip-flops, i would not recommend it:)..The last bit is very steep, but Yan is an outstanding guide and will help you to the top! You will be rewarded with a magnificent scenery! Dont forget to bring your camera/gopro. Thank you Yan and Henri!:)"
"We took a guided hike up Le Morne Brabant (3h) with the excellent Yanature and as a result highly recommend a trip with Yan. Its a 6km round trip with almost 500m of climbing. Getting to the top without a guide could be a challenge as the path is not marked and the latter third of the climb is quite tough as you find yourself scrambling rather than walking.  On the tricky parts of the ascent and descent Yan gave us tips on the best way to climbThe views from the top are well worth the extertion. Not only do you feel a great sense of achievement but you get amazing 360 views of the south of the island which are spectacular on a clear day and you are guaranteed to get some stunning pictures. We were told of the significance of the mountain at the top and how the mountain is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Le Morne Brabant is a beautiful place, so even if you don't climb it you can appreciate it from below. If you are going to hike come first thing in the morning as it gets hot quickly, making an already pretty strenous climb even tougher."
This is a must when In Mauritius! It’s a rigorous hike with spectacular views along the way. Definitely worth the effort and fabulous way to get amazing pictures. It’s also free! You can take a taxi to the base/entrance or walk from the St Regis or other nearby hotels. Was a 2.5 hr hike round trip from the St Regis.
"hiked up Brabant which has only become an unguided climb for one year its surprisingly easy and took us about 3 hours total from the gates, the ropes at the top were being fixed so we didn't get to do the end part. Still worthwhile, the views are stunning!!! It's quite shaded and the track is wide and well worn"
"We hiked up to the top of La Morne Brabant yesterday and it was spectacular. We did go with a guide, Bryn from Explorers Mauritius who we thoroughly recommend, he was informative about the area, nature, history gave us some fabulous photos and most importantly where and how to climb safely! This is paramount, as it is definitely no walk in the park but to get to the top it was well worth the views and aching muscles! We had researched beforehand and brought our hiking boots, as there are some places which are physically exerting for non climbers like ourselves but trainers would be fine. We set off at 6:45 and took about 3hours to get up and down from the top. Any later than that you will find is extremely hot for the descent. If you don’t want to climb to the very top it is a relatively easy walk to the midpoint and you will also get some fantastic views. Enjoy !"
Climbing to the top is a bit challenging for ordinary person but it's worth doing it. Half way through is a normal road and everybody can do it. View from there is also amazing. It's free and no need for tour guide just a water and some powerbars.My advice is do not go up to the top on a wet day
"this was our first hiking ever, but we really liked it. it was really impressive to climb on this beautiful and historically rich mountain. our guide Allan was great, he explained us everything and made it easy us, and also whole tour talking about historical facts and things happenned in past on mountain. we will never forget this experience. thank you Allan!!"
"Had a fantastic morning with Zac our guide who took us and 4 others up this mountain. Amazing views, great climb, great guide. Highly recommend"
"had a great climb, especially the rock climbing part, you need some skills to do it to the top for a stunning view. worth it!! downhill is a little bit challenging, just make it slow & steady. Have FUN !!"
Highly recommend trekking up Le Morne.. the views are just breathtaking. I would recommend some half decent footwear's with trainers as a minimum. If you are venturing further than the first point then I would say some good outdoor trekking shoes. Make sure you take some refreshments with you
"Differently worth a climb, we done it in trainers and were fine. Climbs not easy and has a few loose rocks around but worth it."
excelent activity to see the island from a peak. very nice views from above and sportfull. recommended!!!
Been here with yanature... amazing experience!! Although its quite challenging to get to the top but its all worth it!!! The views are out of this worldHighly recommend!!!
"Climbing Le Morne Brabant is a tough and dangerous venture. Its not suitable for young kids nor for the very unfit. Take note, its climbing not a leisurely walk. I have done it twice and the views are something to behold. Be sure to use a guide going up the mountain."
"Hiking Le Morne Brabant was slightly more challenging than I expected but it's definitely worth a try. Please keep it mind it's a hike, not a trekking. You need to have water and a pair of good shoes. Exploring this lovely mountain with such a sad history was my favorite day on the island. It's not for elderly people or children, I wouldn't recommend it on a rainy or very windy days. The way was nicely marked and it's not an Everest but there were a lot of people walking with us who seems to forgot it's still a mountain. On steep areas with a lot of tiny, slippery rock, it's easy for an accident. Go, have a wonderful day with amazing views but think about safety first :) on the beginning of your trek you're putting your name and a phone number in the book, it's for safety reasons I believe."
"Climbing this mountain is highly recommended for everyone visiting Mauritius. The views from the top are absolutely stunning. The guides from the Yanature team were really patient and helpful, always making sure that everyone was ok, giving proper rest breaks and helping everyone get up and down the mountain safely. Highly recommended!"
"Wonderful climb, and little hard for people with weak knees - but totally worth it! We took our time to climb as we were not in a rush, had a great bonding moment. It's a must do - the view is so magical that you cannot really get it in a photograph! P.S since the climb is not private anymore, it is better to go early in the morning. Enjoy your climb!"
this place is worth all the pain. on the top of the mountain you have the beautiful view of the south west coast. it is quite difficult to climb but well worth it. take some water along n enjoy the climb
"On top of Le Morne Brabant you've a great view to the beaches. To get to the top it's a great hike up the mountain. Don't doch this on a sunday, there are a lot of people up there"
