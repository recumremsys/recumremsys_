"Its an amazing place which offers excellent view of the valley and mountains. But its disheartening to see the bad management, litter everywhere, railing broken in many places, crowds of young guys doing hookahs and drugs openly. Don't feel much at peace if you are with family.Need some guards or police patrolling in the area."
Superb location with fantastic view. Must visit this location in Lonavala. Having many local food outlets there to enjoy location.
Best place to visit with friends and family in Monsoon season.The view is epic with fog and awesome rainfall. Drive carefully as the place is situated at the top of the mountain. Must visit place if you go to Lonavala. Approx 8kms from Lonavala main market area.Preferable if you have a car.
"At this point, you can enjoy the amazing view of Lonawala. You can see the real beauty with awesome weather. Enjoy different snacks over there."
The view is nice if visited during the rains . Tends to get pretty dirty due to the huge influx of people. Must visit in in Lonavala though.
Very polluted and littered.  Try and find a quieter place to enjoy the view from a quieter place.  There seem to be a lot of trails around that you could use to get away from the crowds.
"One of the few beautiful places to see in Lonavala. The view is totally mesmerizing. Get a beautiful view of sunset from this point. You can see the sunset here better, with ample space, compared to the so called sunset point on road side. While you watch, you can enjoy roasted corn, Maggi, pakoras etc. Beware of monkeys! Recommended to visit during monsoon."
The magic of nature! After rainy days the whole scene is transferred to a  awesome green valley. Spend some time and you will fill clouds passing and you can feel the  changing the atmosphere. Best in rainy season.
"Offers a stunning view of the plateau below. Ample parking. Expect a huge crowd with loads of stalls, camel rides, selfie people...but once you tune them out you can just enjoy a very relaxing breathtaking view of the countryside."
"Located at beautiful top , the journey from town is amazing with good location. But you can enjoy the view when there is fog. There was full of fog when we visited so could not enjoy the view. Otherwise nice place to visit."
"Lion's point is the Highest point in Lonavala and you can enjoy the beautiful view of Waterfalls and hills from this Point. you can either hire a taxi from your hotel or drive your own car to reach here. Auto is a Bad Idea as it cannot go up the Slopes.Also, Weather here is very unpredictable so always carry umbrella or raincoats. There are few local eating shops here, serving maggie, pakora's etc. Beware of Monkeys though as there are many.I think it has a paid parking, which is not much, but if you take Taxi, the parking fee is taken care by driver."
Best in rainy season for couples. Find a cab or auto to reach this place. Fun if you go in groups like friends and family.
"This place is now like a hub during the monsoons. It is definitely a must visit if you're in or near Lonavla, especially during the monsoons. Its foggy, breezy and pleasant. It is ahead of Bushi dam. Pay and parking available at a couple of places. Things to eat here: Corn bhaji, Maggi, Chai, Kanda Bhaji.*Beware of the monkeys*"
"Very nice place. Awesome climate. Beware of monkeys. Good view. For vehicle parking, they are charging 50rs.Visitors should maintain this place, as noticed most of them are throwing covers, food, and waste there itself. Soon this place will spoil if people will not maintain hygiene."
"Excellent view point of lonavala hill station and surrounding hills. Good spot for photos. Would spend about 30 mins here. Be sure to go up-hill to the 2nd viewing area, it’s less busy there."
"Visiting Lion’s Point on the outskirts of Lonavala is a must for any tourist, when visiting Lonavala. It is within a short driving distance from Lonavala. Parking could be challenging. The natural scenery all around is flabbergasting and one can get some awesome views of the changing sky colors just before sunset. The best thing is that it is free."
A serene and a beautiful spot around 1800 feet above sea level. We missed the clear view as it was raining and covered with clouds. Yet there are some good points.Fantastic hot bhajias prepared on the spot by locals served with Hot tea. Also on offer are maggi and other eatables. Supporting locals is necessary but so is negotiating.Tips - 1. Ask your driver to first take you to Lions Point and then Bush’s dam as you may catch cold after getting wet. Weather can b cold here.2. They charge for parking so negotiate with your tours to include it.
"When one need a really good place for a decent drive from Mumbai or Pune. This will be a good location. Relaxing, Cold winds blowing. A screensaver pic which can be captured at sunset point. One really needs to go to catch a nice weekend"
"LOve this place any time i visit Lonavala. Have tea and Pakora near sunset , view is awesome and people are nice"
"Amazing sight seeing. Some brilliant corn, pakodas and tea in the rain with a great view. Drive all the way there with ample parking"
Nice place to visit in Lonavla. Crowded and parking is a big issue here. Otherwise it is a good point to enjoy with friends and family
"The dual points Shooting spot and Lion point are a must visit spots on a trip of Lonavala. It provides a picturesque and breathtaking view of the valley. It is motor able right to the peak. There are lot of other activities like - ATV ride, camel-horse rides, food stalls etc. There is a lot for photography lovers too. Do visit."
"Most popular attraction in Lonavla, Maharashtra. gives a clear and scenic view of Sahyadris on a clear day. A must visit during monsoons wherein it is covered in clouds with light drizzle. Remains windy all throughout the year. Enjoy Indian snacks/delicacies right there from the local vendors - they are equally worthy. Nearby spots include Amby Valley. Occasionally there are arrangements for paragliding arranged from a nearby airstrip - haven't seen it though in recent past. Do take some spare time as at times the approach road from Lonavla city to Lion's point gets choked at few spots particularly in holidays and weekends. Overall - a must visit."
The point gives you stunning view of the entire hills plateus and deep valley. The breeze is nice and makes you relaxed from all pains and tensions. Get an idea of the climate before planning the trip because during sunny days it may not be recommended to visit ..
"A ritual to come at this point whenever you are in Lonavala. It's a great place to be to enjoy the view. Be aware of monkeys if you are carrying eatables things, they mighty just snatch it. Washroom facility should be there so, that people don't loiter around. This is famous point where most of the people visit hence, should be taken care by responsibile authorities. Best place to visit is Rainy season to enjoy the fog but avoid weekends during rainy season."
"Very crowds even during rains r... reach early .misty clouds make for a perfect backdrop for some friendly, romantic or family pics . Be careful of your excursions and your steps . Chai pakoras and Maggi are a must . Guys please keep the area clean ... please please do not litter ."
"The place was recommended for a scenic view and tapri snacks like tea ,pakoras & maggi . The view is nice but I am sure its much better during / after monsoons . The place around the peak is super dirty and was not at all manage . This could be a really nice picnic spot if kept well. Looked like more of a show off for bike lovers who just drive their super bikes ."
"Visited the lions point and tiger point , all on the same road. Couldn't really understand why they are named so. You good good view of the valley down, probably could provide better exciting sunset views. One difference compared to other view points is that, you have a wide open area to walk around and relax (if you can ignore the littering around)."
Good viewing point from peak. Also good entertainment for children as horse ride etc were offered. Fast Indian foods also were on the stalls. A decent experience by and large. Recommended.
"Visited this point along with family, this point is famous for sun set. you can relax here and view the sun as it sets. Enjoy the tea and snacks along."
"Wonderful view point in Lonavala.  Need to climb up the small hill. Cabs can reach near view point. The views of the valley below on a clear day are fantastic. Excellent panoramic view of mountains around. Good place for photographs and selfies.We visited during mid day, hot sun hitting us like anything. Best time is during sun set and monsoon season. In rainy season you can see the waterfalls from the mountains."
"Its a beautiful place located on hill top near lonavla. Provides a very beautiful view of the valley if you can see it, because its densely emerged in fog. Makes you feel like walking in clouds. Best time to visit is during monsoons(Jun-Aug) and also is good during winters.Try not to bother about rains and keep your raincoats/umbrella (Raincoats hardly are of use and umbrella's get blown by winds)aside and set yourself lose to enjoy the moment.There are also many shops providing hot bhajiyas,maggi, tea/coffe etc. costing over priced but worth eating in that amazing climate."
"Very good weather in almost all season, you can not get any activity to do. Its just open space but many meter above the sea level. One can see fog, clouds just at your eye level and even sometimes below your eyes. there are railing for safety too... tea stalls are there and you can get some wafers in small shops. Surrounding series of mountains are making great view. Autorikshaw may charge you a lot to go there from railway station but its good to share fare with another people if you are two only..."
"Most of us know it's really beautiful during monsoon , so I wanted to try during summer . Took an auto from the station , which cost us 400 with dropping back to station and one hour wait but yeah , it's worth it . The place is really beautiful , amazing cool breeze. Less tourist during summer , you can have a good time with family , less greenery"
"One of the famous place to visit in Lonavala. A perfect weekend gateway with mininum travelling from Pune and Mumbai. Situated on the hills of lonavala, road is poorly maintained, considering the sharp turns it needs to be improvised. A rocky surfaced land, which gives breath taking view of nature, beautiful to visit in the evening, having a cup of tea or coffee and enjoying the sunset. There are many food stalls offering the local delicacies, what i loved the most is the CHEESE PAKODA . Amazing taste of melted cheese with indian spices and deep fried. They even offer hukka on public demand.Overall a good place to visit with friends and family."
