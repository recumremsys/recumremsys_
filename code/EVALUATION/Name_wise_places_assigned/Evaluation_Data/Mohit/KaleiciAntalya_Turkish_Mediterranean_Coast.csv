Visited this town recently and the views are amazing n and well worth visiting . Lots of shops and restaurants in the vicinity and you can also get boat trips from the marina.
"Visited the old town on a day trip from Lara beach resort, 75 lira in a taxi . This place is gorgeous,  lovely old town with harbour and nice eating places overlooking harbour.  Long walk down to harbour but if u walk along there is a lift that will take u up and down   also taxis for a few lira.  Well worth a visit"
"Wandering around the little streets of Kaleici is very relaxing. There are plenty of bars and restaurants in lovely courtyard settings, where you can sit in the shade surrounded by greenery."
"Loved Kaleici, such a pretty place. Harbour side is so beautiful, boat trips available for long or short trips. Lots to see and do within walking distance, but also public transport is good. Taxis are reasonable for trips further afield. Duden waterfalls, a must. Shopping is fantastic, shoes, clothes etc.. we had lots of pampering with hair cuts/wash and blow drys/ colouring/nails etc.. very reasonable. Plenty of bars and restaurants with good cheap food. People are very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely go again."
"The Antalya Harbour and Old Town is beautiful. You have nice sea food restaurants on the Harbour and beautiful winding streets with souvenir/gift shops, carpet shops and replica bag. Everyone is willing to deal and you can bargain to your hearts content. There are some historical places such as the old mescit, clock town and Hadrian's Gate. The market opens into the Tophane Park which has nice cafes and the main city bazaar which has nice restaurants and shops. Loved it."
The streets of Kaleici are like a web of winding streets and buildings which hold so much character. Can easily get lost in these streets but its not large enough to be much of a problem. Anyone who visits Antalya must visit Kaleici. Filled with plenty of souvenir shops with lots of antiques and turkish/greek culture.
got public bus from lara to visit kaleci. pretty old town to spend half day looking round. there is a lift from here down to the harbour. due to the pandemic not many places open but still worth going to look round all the old streets very interesting.
Cobbled streets and wonderful buildings are found throughout Kaleici along with many fabulous seafood restaurants. A great place to spend s few days exploring
Loved the vibe of the whole place. All major attractions are close by. Also very well connected to other parts
"A relaxing walk while being surrounded by great views, old traditional buildings, cozy restaurants with very tasty food, souvenirs shops and friendly people. The whole way from Hadrian’s Gate to the old harbor district is a delight, with plenty spots where to stop for photos.A must see of Antalya, don’t miss it. Get ‘lost’ on the streets and enjoy every corner."
"Liked the labyrinth of shops, restaurants  bars and sights.  Most shops sold designer copies but you can bag a bargin on tour prices in the streets and jewellery."
"The old town is lovely in terms of views and things to see. Very historic in nature. Wear comfortable shoes as its very rocky and you will constantly be going up and down steep roads, extremely tiring after a while. It took me about two days to explore the whole old town but a day is enough to get get a feel and experience what it's all about.Plenty of places to eat and dine. There are loads of market stalls going down tot he marina and bazaars around the area. be sure to haggle as the prices they throw at you are ridiculous I paid 20 Lira for two bracelets, walked down the road to a proper shop and they were priced at 3 lira for one or 4 for 10.  There are loads of fake clothes and bags, they are not real, even if the shop keeper guarantees the authenticity. if you would still like to buy some I would advice going out of the city centre into more loca bazaars where they are a lot cheaper! I bought a little designer coin purse for 5 lira, though it took extreme negotiation skills. Dont be afraid to walk away as they often call you back at the price you want. You can walk down to the marina which is nice. You can pay around 90lira or 10 euros or so to go on a little boat trip. Nice trip, though you dont really see the caves or anything close up, thats what the excursions are for.They have quite alot of bars there too. The people are really friendly and service is good."
"Forget all expectations This part of Turkey is full of wonderful sights, smells, tastes and most of all people. If you want 5 star hotels and long white beaches go south of Kaleici. If you want to be enchanted at every turn go to Kaleici....I truly love this place and will be back."
"Get yourself ready for nice,long walk, good shooping and some nice place to eat. Old town have special spirit and its MUST  to visit."
"Wonderful place. Stayed there for 7 days and everyday we used to discover a new path, a new street that leads to extraordinary traditional charming house. A must."
"During our stay in Antalya, we decided to take a break from hotel and to visit popular neighbourhood - Kaleici. And we didn’t regret it. It has preserved its old, authentic look. Walking through small ,,kaldrma” streets is unique experience. Streets are full of cafes and places to buy clothes and souvenires. Definitely a must in Antalya"
"It’s very nice place!!! Enjoy magnificent view to the sea. The old town with its narrow streets, cafes, and shops is a real paradise for tourists who look for romantics."
This historic place is very beautiful. Having a walk in Kaleici is like walking through history. Then we would always end up by the sea.
"Filled with shops, cafes & restaurants and boutique hotels, Antalya's Old Town is a 'must visit' place. You can easily spend a whole day walking around or just chill by the historic harbor."
"Loved Kaleici old town. We spent 8 days here, but to be honest, 5 days is more than enough. Last two days, we spent sitting at the park near the sea reading. Kaleici  is full of bazaars but all fakes, which i hated. I cant think of anything worse than seeing hundreds of identical stalls selling designer fakes. The fake bags were shabby and woe betide you if you said they were fakes to the stall owner. Mostly pleasant but you got the odd miserable idiot who wanted you to buy without even browsing. Overall, everything is very expensive. Everyone dealt in euros which made the whole holiday very costly. Liras were accepted but beware when asking prices as they say the first ridiculous high price that pops into their heads. Haggle and bargain or walk away. Dont let them rip you off. Kaleici has beautiful old ruins, stunning mosques, and a gorgeous marina. All within walking distance. There is even a huge five floor shopping mall called Markantalya Mall, nearby. Food generally is cheap, but all that seems to be available us donner kebabs. Theres only so much greasy donner i could bear. There is pizza available too but its a bit more pricey. There is Mcdonalds and Burger Kings and Starbucks there too.The cobbled streets to the marina were so stunning with overhanging pink flowers everywhere. Be careful when buying Zultenite jewellery as im not sure if it was genuine. Overall a lovely scenic part of Turkey"
"Exploring the many little lanes and alleyways to discovering fantastic restaurants, boutique hotels, vistas, the harbour and more. Reminiscent of Rhodes Town but definitely not, Kaleici delights and in winter is much quieter allowing you to explore without the crowds. Delightful!"
"I must say, I am very impressed with Kaleici. I am here for 5 nights before heading towards Kas, probably stopping off at Adrasan on route. I thought 5 nights in Kaleici might be to many nights, I thought we might run out of things to see and do, but the place is a labyrinth of bars, restaurants, shops, bazaars, it is absolutely fantastic. Bars for young and old, classy and local food eateries, I am well impressed.  You can stay in the old town, book a pension or small hotel, and wander around for hours. Go outside the gates (Hadrian) and discover further afield on the excellent Tram/Bus systems"
"Hotel information we need take local small bus / taxi to Manavgat ,than Manavgat bus to Antalya every 15mins ( 1.5hrs journey ) ,arrive outside the town take taxi to old town / centre! Wow !

Walking around spendvyour free times ,fresh fruits drink ” shopping “ ... than few spot for photo .  Don’t expect too many you can get ,just relax ."
"A beautiful little place to visit with cobble streets,great views, interesting little shops and lots of places to eat and drink. We had a lovely Turkish ice cream by the park looking down on the Harbour. Cafes in the park sell delicious fresh fruit juice. Locals are pleasant and not too pushy. So sad to see shops and streets so empty. Let's hope the holiday industry picks up soon for Turkey"
The old city that still has the old style buildings thought of modernisation is taking place. Walking thought he narrow roads you will find nice cafes and small restaurants plus the shops selling all sorts souvenirs.
"Wonderful historic city full of vibrant activity both day and night. Wander through the myriad small streets and alleyways full of restaurants bars and shops. This is a fully functional working city not just for tourists, so you gain a real insight in to local life and culture. Allow at least 1 full day to fully appreciate this remarkable place and to absorb the sights, smells and sounds of a truly remarkable Turkish gem. If you're wondering where to eat amongst all the fabulous restaurants I'd highly recommend Vanilla. If you're looking for Jewellery then I'd recommend Excalibur and if you're looking for a place to stay then Delight Deluxe Boutique Hotel is perfect for a short stay."
"a historical place where you can have fun with its old houses, cafes and shops around the clock. Have fun."
"Get lost during a nice walk among the narrow streets in old Antalya. In every corner you will find a remain of the ancient city, old Roman walls acting being part of current houses."
"Relevant cheap and very good value for money. Do not accept the first or second process and by all means insist on paying in Turkish Lira.....Once that is all done, sit back and enjoy the beautiful  views that Antalya has to offer."
Really loved this area in Antalya. Had a different charm and felt like the town had a soul. Especially liked the little local shops near the sea. Streets were very pleasant to walk in and very charming. Reminded me a little bit of Italy. You can get nice photos from the cliff which overlooks the ocean. Lots of pretty cats also in the area.
"It's not too expensive to get there from any hotel. Bus or Taxi. We went on a warm Feb day and it was so funny to see Turks in their full clobber with their big coats on when it was so warm for us. Lovely views, We had a Horse and cart/carriage ride which you can haggle the price. They pull over half way and take your photos by the sea for you with your own camera then he takes you back. Lots of little stalls and millions of shops. Visited Hadrian's Wall so don't forget that bit. Only went there to see the sights and brought back some lovely souvenirs. They will try and encourage you to buy from their stalls in the markets but that's to be expected."
"We are fortunate enough to have travelled worldwide for fifty years. Antalya old town is up there with our favourite places. Perfect for a long weekend, city break, honeymoon, lots of small pensions and boutique hotels for all price ranges. Same for the many assorted restaurants. Great atmosphere, stunning scenery, Roman ruins. Easy reach of transportation to the airport via metro. Other destinations by bus. Don’t hesitate."
"Definitely worth the visit! Lots of culture, food and souvenirs.  The view from the marina is epic and most certainly worth the walk. There are an array of things to do and a  budget to suit all. Try the seafood!"
Took some stunning pictures here and there are some lovely restaurants around the edge with great views of the boats. Try both daytime and night time if you like taking pictures.
"Went here lunch on a tour, it is incredible - the views leave nothing to be desired.  Fabulous place."
