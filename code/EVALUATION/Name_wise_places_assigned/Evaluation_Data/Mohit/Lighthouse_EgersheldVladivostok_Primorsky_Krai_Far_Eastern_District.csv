"Visiting the lighthouse in the middle of winter was really interesting.  The frozen ocean surrounded the path and provided the opportunity to watch ice fishing take place.  Some melted and broken areas also had a family of 8 seals swimming and fishing around, keeping an eye on us as we watched them.The lighthouse itself is small and nothing spectacular, but the setting itself and the view back to the city and bridge makes the trip worth it.  A nice experience"
Having the cold and windy weather would allow to have your privacy to enjoy the majesty of the spot. Make your visit at the time of dusk or down to have the proper light for your pictures.
Enjoyed the walk out to the lighthouse on the spit.  It wasn't underwater when we went as shown in the photo.  It was a lovely view of the bay and great people watching as well.
"My son and I visited the lighthouse on our last day in Vladivostok. We took the 6:30am bus from he city. at the Seraya loshad bus stop. The bus stop is on Aleutskaya Street, a five minute walk from Central square.The popular buses that ply this route are # 59,60,62 and 81. It was a 15 minute trip, and 10 bus stops from town. The fare was 20 rubles. The last stop is at Anna  Shchetinina Park, which is recommended for a short visit, as there are great views of the Bay and Russky Island Bridge from here. Note that after arriving at the Park, which is 4km south of the city, you will still have a 2km walk to the lighthouse.After exiting the bus walk in a southerly direction, and past the bus terminus on the right hand side. All buses turn around at this section, for the return journey into the city. Walk up a slight slope , and a gas station will come into view on your left, and a tall apartment complex on your right.The remainder of the walk is downhill and quite easy. A few more minutes and the lighthouse, and power grid will be seen below. There area few places along the route where you can clamber up the bank and take photos of the lighthouse in the distance. There are a few side roads on the right, but stay to the left as this is the general direction of the lighthouse.At the bottom of the hill is a paved food and beverage area, which has coin vending drink machines. There are a few benches, and fixed binoculars where coins can be inserted for a view of the harbour. Keep walking past the power grid, and on the narrow path to the lighthouse. The path was almost completely covered when we visited. We took quite a few photos here with the lighthouse in the background, and a few photos next to the lighthouse. We were the only visitors at this time. By the time that we decided to leave the strip was entirely covered and we got the best photo, which appeared to show my son walking on water.We then relaxed on the benches in the parking area, and watched sea gulls and the boats in the harbour. The walk back is a little more difficult, as you will now be going uphill. We got a bus at the park, and were back in town by 8:30am. If you are an early riser and do not mind a bit of a stroll in the morning, this will be an unforgettable experience. Remember to bring some bread for the fish and seagulls, as we regretted this error This was one of the most memorable experiences on our trip."
Went there on the final day to see this lighthouse. Apparently it's a great place to go in the summer. But it wasn't summer....
Everything is big in Russia but Vladivostok Light house! it's quite a walk from the bus stop but you can enjoy the view on the bay.  some restaurants are near the lighthouse where you can eat good fish dishes. Bring your swimsuit to enjoy a swim.
Went there durring the day and it is a place many locals love to go to. Apparently during the summer it's pavked with people so it was nice to have the place (more or less) for our selfs. But it was quite windy and we got cold :)But worth a visit.
"Despite of the weather conditions, it is a spot that will not leave you indifferent. Remember to be ready with warm clothes (can be very windy!!!)"
"To get to Tokarevsky Cape, you will feel like you've been to the final frontier. Located at the end of a spit at the western edge of the Pacific Ocean, the lighthouse heralds the entrance ot Vladivostok harbor, Russia's Far Eastern port.Standing here, you are closer to Korea, China and Japan than Moscow. Even though I was here in summer, the wind was howling and it was cold and rainy. I was thankful for my Goretex boots to keep my feet dry.If you have time, I highly recommend making a pit stop at the Octopus Cafe located just a few hundred yards before the parking lot to the lighthouse."
"There are several busses going in the direction of the lighthouse (60,62,59,...). The bus ride should cost 20 rubbles per person. You should take the stop to Mayak.After that you need to walk for around a good 25 minutes to get to the lighthouse. Check on google maps how to get there from the stop (it's pretty easy). At the location you will find some small eating stands and a bar. There is also a nice beach, but a local didn't recommend me to swim the water on that side, due to the pollution. The view you will see is magnificent if good weather (but there will be also a lot of people), but I bet it should be quite mysterious as well with some clouds. We watched the sunset from the lighthouse, it was really special..."
"This place is so beautiful and romantic. I wanna go back there. Go there soak yourself in the sunlight and have some good loving, relaxing and fun time. Don't forget to carry your best swimsuit. You may like to have some dashing photo shoot session too.This is one of the best place I have visited till date in my life. Highly recommended."
