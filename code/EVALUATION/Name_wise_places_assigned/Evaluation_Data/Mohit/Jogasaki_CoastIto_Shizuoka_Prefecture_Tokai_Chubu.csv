"This area is very beautiful and perfect for small and longer walks. Along the coast there are many view points and passages down to the sea. Where, I guess it should be possible to take a swim during summer? Remember to bring GPS if on a longer walks!"
"Coast views are unique. Views are stunning. Special vegitation and rock formations made the walk well worthwhile. In 5 km we met < 10 other walkers. You will need good shoes and the 5 km feels like 10 km, by the time you've been up and down 200 steps and uneven paths. Take your own picnic - there is nothing till you get to the lighthouse from the South end and nothing after the lighthouse from the North."
"Recommended to visit and explore the coastline and Light House there.  There is 2 parking areas, if you care to walk a little longer or just track back to other parking area. The views are magnificient and worth your time to explore.  I think the views will be even better once the autumn colours start to come out."
"The views of the coast formed by lava, is really worth the time and sweat. Do notice, it goes up and down a lot, and the paths are not even, so good shoes and legs are necessary."
We find the rocky coastline more beautiful than white sand beaches and were not disappointed with this. Be sure to take the amazing hike that winds along the coastline-took us maybe 4 hours at a leisurely pace with views of the water and cliffs for almost all of it.
"Just came here to enjoy and admire the beautiful view offered by Jogasaki Coast. Be sure to wear suitable shoes because navigating amongst the huge rocks by the coast can be tricky. Visitors may climb a lighthouse and may also cross the nearby Suspension Bridge as well.Jogasaki Coast is a 30min walk from Jogasaki-kaigan Station. Several sakura trees line up the streets going towards the coast. I am assuming that the place will look ethereal during full bloom of the sakura. Trains arrive in ~1 hour interval, so schedule must be planned and executed well. Jogasaki coast may be included as part of a 3-day itinerary using JR Kanto Area Pass."
Beautiful rugged coast and a nice walk up and down stairs and a winding path (hard work with a pram on that route; there is a flat path through the forest but it is also hard work with a pram due to loose stones). Don't fall over the edge if you take the coastal route!There's a lighthouse and suspension bridge at the end.
"This would be one of the main attractions points in Izu. You would not be disappointed to visit this place specially if you come on a clear day. Ocean looks just mesmerizing, it roaring sound make you feel vastness of mother nature. During high tide when waves struck the rocks along the coast there is no words to describe the feelings. Water is blue as we see in the movies and looks amazingly beautiful. Don’t forget to take walking route between jogasaki coast-hanging bridge-light house. Be ready to walk a little in the cool breeze of fresh and damp air, have a nice trip. Cheers"
So it isn't really a beach- more a hike/walk along amazingly scenic rocky coastline. We went on a misty rainy day and it couldn't have been more perfect. The water is so blue and clear. The waves are so fantastic crashing against the coastline.  The plants are so lush and green. We started at the lighthouse and suspension bridge and walked about 1.5 km which took us to gardens with food and toilet facilities. There is another coast line walk that starts there for about 8 km to another suspension bridge but we were short on time. If we had a full day we would have definitely done it. We took the train to Jogasaki station. From there it is a little confusing - supposedly there is a bus you could take but we walked. It was about 20 min walk to the bridge and it was 100% gps guided (there are no signs!).  Walk back was about the same from the gardens. It was a lovely day out - even in the rain!
"The Jogasaki coast is accessible by a network of paved paths and trails, and each turn leads to gorgeous views. Be sure to not miss Renchaku-ji, which is a shrine to Nichiren Daishonin, who founded the Nichiren school of Buddhism, which is the fastest growing branch of Buddhism these days. Nichiren was rescued from rocks off the coast by a fisherman, and the place where he was rescued can be seen from the trail near Renchaku-ji."
"Take the full tour from the small suspended bridge on the western end of the trail to the eastern suspension bridge. It's 4-5 hours of breadthtaking views and beautiful coastal forests with the Pacific Ocean wind constantly feeding your lungs with ocean air. My girlfriend and I must have taken 50 pictures each, and we were even holding back. Go here on a beautiful day with clear view for the best experience."
"It was a great hike along some amazing coastline. But bring some proper shoes. Try this in flip flops and you risk a sprained ankle. There are 2 exciting suspension bridges, a shrine and lots of excellent viewing points on this hike which took me about 4 hours."
"Arrived around 15:00, we parked our vehicle near the flower garden, and it is a 1km walk alone the shoreline to the light tower and the suspension bridge.The path is beautifully paved, mixed into the nature and yet easy to walk. The view along the way is magnificent. When you are on the bridge, the view is even better. If you are scare of height, you still should give this a try as the view is breath taking.On the way back, there is another path you can choose, 300 meter less to walk but the path is filled with stones.All done in an hour. One of the best view one would never forget.天崖海角的地方。沿途風景優美，只是一公里的路便到吊橋，怕高的也應試一試。整個行程一個鐘而已。絕美的風景，一生也不會忘記"
"Used our 1-day bus pass to get to Jogasaki Goshu and then did the cliff top walk to the flower garden  park. While it is a short walk circa 2km there are lots of up and down steps.  Interesting rock -lava, formations to see, a scary blow hole, the mouth of river with suspension bridge above the raging waters and beautiful coastal scenery. Didn’t have time to visit the park and flower gardens but coach loads of Japanese tourists came to visit. We continued on with our bus sightseeing trip to My Omura and then back to Ito. The bus pass is excellent value for money."
"I recommend you spend a couple of hours at this lovely viewpoint. So pack a lunch, a beer and some yakitori . It's a short walk from the hwy and bus stop. Walk the trail down to the far end and explore the cliffs and drop-offs if you are a confident hiker/walker . - not for small kids or the elderly. Otherwise you can take the elevator down into the sea cave and watch the waves crash in. The elevator is expensive. We didn't bother but enjoyed the trail down to the cliffs instead.There is a small park with shrines just before the cliffs where you can rest in the shade on a bench and eat your packed lunch.  Highly recommend you visit the cliffs when there are large sea swells crashing into the cliffs...so don't be afraid to visit this spot when the weather isn't calm or nice......much more exciting when the waves are large."
"Visited on a overcast, damp day and was reminded of home. Very crowded with several bus tours but worth the trip from nearby Ito. Crashing waves and high cliffs - plenty of photo opportunities"
"Very easy ""hike"" which some women did in heals though I wouldn't recommend that. You can do it in less than one hour or take your time checking out lava rock formations and spend a few hours at it. I went over a holiday weekend and it was packed, although all the tourists were Japanese, so I didn't mind! Felt like I did a ""local holiday weekend""."
"A nice walk, not too hard, just keep a steady pace and stop if you’re tired. Wear decent shoes, high heels a no-no, and appropriate clothing for the weather and time of year.Plenty of toilets available on the way and apart from rocks, trees and the sea, there’s a lighthouse and a suspension bridge to enjoy."
"Located on the south of Ito, Jogasaki Coast 城ヶ崎海岸 is a gigantic lava rock coast with a magnificent formation spanning about 9 kilometres. It was formed by the erosion of the ocean waves into the rock, after the volcanic eruption of Mt. Omuro 大室山 4000 years ago.There is a large parking lot (500 yen per entry) at the park and after a short walk one would reach a hiking trail and the Kadowaki Lighthouse 門脇灯台. You can walk up to the observation deck at the lighthouse to look at the Izu Shichito Islands 伊豆七島 during a good day.Further along the trail one would reach the Kadowaki Suspension Bridge 門脇吊橋. Spanning 48 metres in length, it is one of the most famous sightseeing spots in Izu. Apart from the really beautiful scene one can also immerse in the vegetation and trees around."
"Definitely worth the visit. Try to come early or later in the day for better lighting for picture taking. If you come later in the day, in late fall/winter, do allocate some time to make it back to the parking lot in time before it gets dark on the trail paths. The sun goes down quite fast in winter around 3:30 or 4pm. Could easily be disoriented in the dark and under thick vegetation. The suspension bridge was closed for repair at time of visit."
"It was a cloudy day, but the sun was trying to poke through.  We were a group of seven....22 to 77 years old.  The walk was doable and nobody complained.  We could see incredible rock formations....volcanic.  It is a short walk from Izu Kogen station (1km).  There is a cave with a small shrine in it that some of the locals showed us.  The clarity of the water was awesome.  Although a bit steep at points, the trail was easy to walk on.  We came to a suspension bridge and spent a few minutes looking off of it.  The view was great.  After that, at a rest area with benches, some of us took the path down to the rocks below.  Fishermen were perched upon the jagged rocks, waves crashing in, trying to catch their dinner.  I heard there were plenty of fish that thrive in the clear, fertile waters.  You can then cut up to the station, or take a longer route which is about 5 km longer.  Good for everyone, and a lovely way to see some rocky cliffs along the ocean formed by volcanic activity.  Enjoy, but don't wear high heels....like some woman we saw on the trail was wearing.  PS:  English description are all over the trail.  Learned a lot about it.  So really, enjoy!"
