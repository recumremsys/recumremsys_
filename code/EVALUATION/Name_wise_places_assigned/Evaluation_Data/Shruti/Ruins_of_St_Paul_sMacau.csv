"One of them is the Ruins of St. Paul’s. It was built between 1602 and 1640, by Jesuits. At the time, it was one of the biggest catholic churches in China. Today, you will be able to visit the Church and the College dedicated to St. Paul. Half of the structure was burnt in 1835, but the front of the building stands tall to this day and it was an astonishing sight. Symbolism for the Holy Trinity is carved at the top. Depicting the sun, the moon, and the stars are one of the many elements of architectural interest on top of the facade. The most prominent of all is the statue of Jesus underneath these symbols. It combines a lot of elements from western and eastern architecture, since people from many different ethnicities, such as Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Italians, were involved in the building process.   There are many interesting stories surrounding the Ruins of St. Paul’s and the one I found the most interesting talks of a tunnel connecting St. Paul’s Church to the inner harbor. It is one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World and was part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, in 2005."
Finally we made it to the Ruin of St Paul's Roman Cathoric Church which was built in 1602 and destroyed by fire in 1635. The granite facade is all that remains of the Church and is now Macau's most famous landmark. This remains is a World Heritage and a must go attraction in Macau. Packed with tourists and difficult to get a nice view for picture. There is a public toilet nearby and many shops line the alley/small road leading to the remains.
"The ruins of St Paul’s needs to be considered as one location in the historic part of the city. By itself, it is probably not worth the visit. When you consider all the other historic buildings, it make for a nice day out if is not too crowded. Wear good walking shoes because there is a lot of cobblestone and inclined sidewalks. If it is hot, carry water."
"It was built in 1602 but ruined by fire. Only the elevation is remained after the big fire. As there is long staircase in front of the elevation, you can take a good typical photo there. Don’t miss the displays underground to indicate its history. There are many old stalls around the ruins, enjoy the leisure old city walk."
"is this beautiful facade with 68 stone steps leading up to it. It's the only part left of a Catholic church built in the 1600's and dedicated to St Paul the Apostle It was destroyed by a fire in a typhoon in 1835. It was dangerously leaning and considered to be demolished, but was restored by the Macau government and has been reinforced.All of the historic centre of Macau is UNESCO site. It is very crowded on the steps with everyone trying to get their photos taken but it is still very much worth wandering over to see. The architecture of this facade is breathtaking."
"Its Ruins of St. Paul cathedral. When we visited, it was under renovation. Though a very busy place given the density of tourism in Macau, its one of the few places to visit!! Do try the original Egg Tart on the way back!!"
"The Ruins of St.Paul's are one of the most symbolic places in Macau. The façade of a burnt church, on the top of impressive stairs, opens to the sky. Nearby, one of the most ancient Chinese temples of Macao. There is no better icon for the Portuguese 500 years presence. Too many tourists, though, make it difficult to access it. Try to go there in the evening or even at night, to get a glimpse of this unique token of Macao's Portuguese heritage."
"Ruins of St. Paul's is a major landmark of Macau, and at least we can visit once. It will take you to a place, that is away from the concrete jungle, for some time. Visited during the afternoon, and hence missed the light show in the evening."
"The Church of Mater Dei, informally known as the Ruins of St. Paul's, has long been the most famous landmark in Macau. Originally built between 1602-1640, the church dominated the Macau landscape for two centuries until it was destroyed alongside St. Paul's College during the Great fire of 1835. After the fire, all that remained was the stone facade. The church was never rebuilt, leaving us with the landmark that we have today. In addition to taking in views of this famous World Heritage in Macau, visitors can also visit the small Sacred Art Museum and Crypt situated at the back of the Ruins. The crypt was only rediscovered during excavation work in 1990-95. Other World Heritage attractions surround the Ruins including tiny Na Tcha Temple, the small section of the Old City Wall and Monte Forte. These can all be visited conveniently before or after seeing the Ruins of St. Paul. Note: You can see the Ruins 24 hours a day. However, you can only enter the interior to see the foundations and the Sacred Art Museum from 9am to 6pm daily (free entry). Note: This is where the famous Dragon Parade begins at the start of the Chinese New Year. The dragon performers famously line the steps in front of the Ruins, a real sight to see, before the eye-dotting ceremony and the start of the parade. They then descend and begin the journey through the Historic Centre of Macau. Note: The Ruins are often used during Macau's seasonal light festivals and other festivities which make sue of LED projections. At night, the projections light up the Ruins with creative and interesting short programmes. These can be interesting to see when taking place."
"This is probably the most famous sight in Macau. While the ruins are not a special highlight, the way there and the view at the destination is the interesting thing. Starting from Senado Square, the ruins are accessible through narrow alleys (pedestrian zone) with historic houses, Chinese food stalls and shops. Tip: Turn into a side street. You will immediately find yourself in the everyday life of the Macau people without tourists. Tip: The short ascent from the ruins to Mount Fortress is worthwhile for the wide views over Macau in all directions."
A highlight on our day trip to Macau was visiting the ruins of this once magnificent church which sits adjacent to the Mount Fortress in the centre of Macau. A very popular with tourists and locals alike so expect big crowds of people. Do yourself a favour and climb up to the top of the fort and take in some of the great views.
"Enjoyed the view from the top of the steps. The Ruins of St Paul's is right next to the fortress and museum of Macau so you can do them all at the same time. Senado Square is within walking distance, too."
Visited on a beautiful day.  Interesting facade on the hilltop.  Go from the back side.  Getting to the ruin from the front is super crowded.
"Visited the route of St. Paul today and had a very pleasant experience. Macau is rich in history lots to do in CB on casinos, get out there and enjoy it"
"Getting to the ruins is half the fun. The cobblestone streets are teaming with shops, little alley ways with touches of their Portugal influences. Give it a go and enjoy the people watching!"
"The facade is very beautiful. It is huge. Pay attention to the detail, there are some statues and carvings. I went there at noon, and I believe there are hundreds of people here taking pictures. Therefore if you want to visit here tourist free, better come early in the morning."
sort of crowded. love the crypt and small museum. even better if they the museum is bigger where you ca view the while history of it. so may shops near it. toilets are beside it and is clean.
Just the facade of the church. Not many to be seen. Proceed to Macau Museum next to this ruin will complete the experiences.
Crowded but a must!  This iconic structure of a by-gone era proudly stands atop a hill in the old area of Macau. Immaculate gardens and quite clean despite the hordes of tourists
"Next to Monte de Forte.Next to shopping area (no halal tasters/food). Look for merchandise shop near Starbucks, one of their staff is Indonesian.Must visit place when you are in Macau."
It is a sight. But the weather was too hot and it's extremely crowded to get near the architecture. Go to the side stairways with lesser humans. You can take a better shot there.
Great reminder of Macau’s Portuguese and catholic past. Not much more than a facade but you get to see the past glory of this colony for more than 300 years. This history resonates into food and family. Follow the stairs up and taste the touristy streets around it. Good luck and enjoy!
Get some pics clicked and pose differently on the stairs in front of the monument as this is an important and most prominenet landmark of city. There are shops available right at the bottom of stairs where you can have some local egg tarts and street food to enjoy.
Although this is an impressive ruin. Think about timing your visit as both the walk up to it and the site was very busy.
"There are many people visiting this tourist spot of Macau. Thou crowded, but I think it is worth visiting and see the Ruins of St Paul church when in Macau. Recommended!"
"It is highly unlikely that any tourist to Macau would leave this amazing former Portuguese colony without seeing the famed Ruins of St Paul’s.   Put simply, this attraction is the Number One Icon of Macau and for many is the prime reason why they choose to organise a visit here, whether on a day trip from Hong Kong or to stay a couple of nights. My wife and I chose the latter and we stayed two nights at the Hotel Royal in Macau as part of our 18 day Asian adventure to celebrate our 40 anniversary in January 2020. On day one of our visit we walked from the Hotel to experience the historic centre of Macau and top of the agenda was to see the Ruins of St Paul’s, the famous surviving façade of the Church of Mater Dei, which was built in 1602 – 1640 but destroyed by fire in 1835, leaving just the beautiful granite church façade and the 68 stone steps leading up to the church as a timely reminder of the magnificence that had stood before.  At the back of the façade we noted that the structure is buttressed with concrete and steel such that the façade’s aesthetic integrity Is maintained.  The Ruins of St Paul's collectively comprise both the Church facade and the archaeological remains of St Paul's College, both victims of this same fire in 1835. What an imposing sight before us when we arrived at our destination.  The façade dominates the landscape measuring 23 metres across and 25.5 metres high.   Also there were just so many tourists and locals gathered on the steps leading to the façade making a most colourful scene indeed.  We felt we needed to be extra careful in looking after our valuables with so many people around, as a precaution.  An information sign near the front of the Ruins describes how the façade is subdivided into five horizontal levels that have an ascending reading order, as follows –“The insignia of the Jesuits is inscribed above the doorways of the side entrances, while the Latin name of the Church of Mater Dei meaning the ‘Mother of God’ is engraved above the central entrance.  On the level above the entrance are four bronze statues of Jesuit saints – Fransisco de Borja, Ignatius Loyola, Francis Xavier and Luis Gonzaga.  The statue of the Virgin Mary is in the next level up, flanked by a seven-headed hydra,  a skeleton, a Portuguese merchant ship and a winged demon with inscriptions in Chinese that convey biblical messages.  At both ends of this level there are Chinese lions jugging out the façade below the pinnacles.  On the next upper level, the statue of Jesus Christ as a child is located, surrounded by the passion tools.  A dove representing the Holy Spirit is found at the centre of the triangular pediment and a Latin Cross crowns the ensemble.  The overall composition presents a fusion of different influences on a local, regional and global scale.”We were so pleased to have found this information sign so that we could look more closely and marvel at these amazing detailed features, so well preserved and standing the test of time.    For us, after having admired and marvelled at the entire facade and its detailed features, we could only conclude that here, up on this hill, must surely have stood a most magnificent Church indeed until it was lost to Macau and to the World through the ravages of fire.   However, it is so wonderful that as least the Church’s façade could be saved and made available for generations of tourists and locals to appreciate and admire and for that we should all be thankful."
This place must be one of the most visited place in Macau. It was packed with tourist even it was a working day. Standing majestically after so many years
"Visit the St Paul’s Ruins is just like traveling back in time. We can imagine how magnificent the Seminar was back then. A place not to be missed, even with the millions of visitors from around the world...!"
"Going to Macau, head over to Ruins of St Paul is a must. Beautiful place to take romantic pictures. Lot’s of food area too, local delights"
"History in your face. Fought over by priests. Battled over by invaders and saved by the people of Macau and their slaves who were given their freedom for their loyalty and love of their adopted cityVisit this then go up the escalator to the Monte Fortress . History of Macau from Neanderthal times. Think some of the relatives still live in Coloane village, where recently settlement sites have been found"
We went through on our way back to hotel. Was interesting to see with a nice view from the hill and its castle
"Visited during the day tour under Macau Discovery Tour, by Cotai Travel. Nothing much, just a left over church that surrounded by a lot Street food and shopping alley.  Worth to visit if you are 1st tinder at Macau."
"A must see in Macau. The Ruin of St Paul is a tourist icon in Macau. Definitely worth seeing, don't forget to buy a famous egg tart here at the many bakeries nearby! Gets busy in afternoon with tourists, so go early if you want to avoid crowds. Walk down to Senado Square after, admiring all the Portugese style buildings."
"Made a special journey out of our business meeting to see if this was still here. Yes, still at the centre of old Macau, like a the centre piece of an old Spanish western. Go see it it’s beautiful."
"Fascinating piece of Portugal in China- I loved looking around the ruins and reading everything about the history of the area. Going inside is worth it.  There were some art pieces, but you could tell a few were removed for preservation.Note: There are many steps leading up, so be aware if you have issues."
