"We just spent a truly stellar day at the Safari Park. Walked to many exhibits of animals. Rode the tram up the steep Caucuses Mountains with spectacular views. Had great borscht, cold beet salad, and goulash at the restaurant at the top. I believe we heard thunder on the way up the mountains!! Earlier at breakfast we had seen live dolphins in the water outside our hotel! Tigers, lions, deer, giant owls, all manner of things to be seen. I am 66 and had no trouble walking quite a ways with my son's help.  Had a little rain but nothing to stop us."
