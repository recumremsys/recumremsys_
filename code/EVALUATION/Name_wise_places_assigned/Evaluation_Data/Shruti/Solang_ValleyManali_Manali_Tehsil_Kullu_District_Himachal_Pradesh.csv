The place is beautiful. The best of Nature. Saw the place on my way from Manali to Leh-Ladakh. I did not see snow as it was not the main season. I did not wait here much as i was on a road trip.
"It is a must visit place. Beautiful ropeway , beautiful scenic beauty. The drive from Manali to Solang Valley is mesmerising. Lots of activities can be done at Solang Valley. Don't miss out Solang Valley when you visit Manali."
"We visited Solang  valley on the second day of our Manali trip . Solang valley is about 13 kms from Manali town and can be reached in 30 minutes if trip is planned early about 8 am during peak tourist seasons . Roads are narrow and can expect 3-4 km long traffic jams when you return from there or if started late in the afternoon . Not enough parking space available there .Vehicles parked on the road sides and coming in the wrong direction can create a complete mess . Not enough traffic police personnel available on roads to regulate traffic . Don't opt  for trip packages offered by road side shops(plenty of them available in the route )  as the prices are not fixed and they may cheat you .  What you need to have to go for snow area ( if the sky is clear and snow is present in mountains) , are snow suits ( may cost only 250-300 Rs per person ) , Rubber boots , gloves made of  water proof materials and the thermals and jackets normally used to wear in hill stations . Goggles are not required . Don't opt for packages which includes skating , rubber tube slide, zip line etc and guide. Many of these activities can be enjoyed directly paying at the spot at much lesser rate and guide is of no use,  as there is nothing to travel around and see with the help of a guide .When we visited Solang valley days were sunny and the valley was filled with fresh snow . Place is good for a 5-6 hr trip and very beautiful during snow season  . A small stream flowing through the valley adds charm to the scenic beauty of the region .In my opinion skiing was not very enjoyable as there were too many people in a small patch of space. Skiing is not something that can be learned in few minutes neither the so called ""guides""  adept at teaching tourists. Most of the time, tourists were bumping into each other and falling over.Starting your onward trip to Solang post noon can spoil your plan as we saw kilometers long traffic jam towards Solang valley while we were returning from there. Our driver had parked much below the tourist drop point in Solang valley to avoid traffic, On our return, we had to walk thru' slippery slushy snow slopes filled with horse dung for ~ 2km. This trek can prove difficult for some.Many vendors selling Maggi , Bread toast , Hot tea/coffee are available there and provide good and cheap option during travel ."
"We visited Solang Valley in February, ar that time this area was full of snow. Although Rohtang pass was closed. Me, my wife and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed parachute jumping. There are two different valley points one is very high and one is less high, You can choose one point for parachute jumping. The charges for very high point at that time were approx 2k per person which includes to and fro fare of rope way. Another hill was lesser in height for which you will have to walk to reach the point by yourself, the charges were Rs 700 per person. One person will accompany you to handle parachute during jump. If you want photo/video of your jump, there are persons who shoot all the jumps taking their turns for different customers. But they asked for Rs 300 for each person's video and Rs 300 for photo, soft copy only. Keeping somebody for making your video can help but it would be difficult to identify which one to  shoot because there are so many jumps happening one by one. One has to be extra alert and must have good camera which can shoot from distance. Some other enjoymemts can be ice skating, ice scooter etc. If you ask a professional to take photos while playing in the snow, the guy will deliver it to your hotel also. The charge for the dress and shoes to wear while going to the valley was Rs 300 per person. You can also enjoy juices,shakes and snacks in the cafeteria."
Take cable car at solang valley to reach at some higj altitude to see simply breath taking snow capped mountains with fresh snow. There are no adventure activities at top.
"Solang Valley is beautiful and just so much reminds of the Swiss Alps sans the chaos and running madness of vendors who actually harasses you to buy their services, whether you need or you do not need. Nestled in the Himalayas and so near to Manali, Solang Valley is just a treat to one’s tiring eyes from city life and to lot of us who loves all and everything about Snow! The best part is that you can actually do so many activities at Solang. Right from a ATV bike ride upto the Snow point ( they ask for INR  1200 per person but if you’re lucky then you can negotiate it for INR 900) to ride on the mules to travel on a rope way ( costs INR 650 per person) to skiing to paragliding to other games for children and adults. Everything is not worth unless you’re ready to throw away money. Best time to visit ? Ofcourse early to mid part of December since till then your car can go to the end point from where Solang Valley begins or else be ready to either walk up or ride an expensive ATV. The ride to ropeway is just amazing and a whole lot of fun with children. You can witness the majestic Solang Valley from top and that’s worth every penny. Cons ? Exorbitant costs of all activities and that I think should should be regulated by some Association or by the Government. Even the cost of a cup of coffee at the top is just too much unless you’re not worried at all. Pros ? The view of the majestic snow capped Himalayas and able to play with real Snows with your family and friends and silently appreciate the gorgeous view of the Nature!"
Solang valley is pure beauty . But but visit this place in winters which addd double beauty to this place . I went in september so there was no snow but every time is an experience so it was good . There are many sporting activites which take place during winters so i am sure planning for december . Coming to the viewss are just so beautiful . I saw on Google exactly the same view but i was little dissapointed not to witness the snow . But there is always next time so yeah .. There is a waterfall name Anjani mahadev waterfall which is also a must visit place when you visit solang valley ..
"Visited solang valley in the first week of April 2019 . Actually the snow is very dirty once u reach the valley. One can play with snow around this place if you dont want to take the cable car ride which takes you to the top of the mountain.The cable ride costs you Rs 650 per person for a round trip. It is quite expensive only, put the view high up is very nice. From there we walked up in the snow and spent around 3 hours playing in the snow. please wear proper clothing so that u can enjoy the snow. A good pair of gloves will help a lot !!"
"I am also one of those tourists who came across this gem of nature's beauty while googling for snow places in India. I am detailing all the details of my experience of this place How to reach?a) Once you reach manali , solang valley is approx. 10 km from manali centre. b) From shimla its approx. 8 hours journeyc) From chandigarh its approx. 9 hours journeyIs this the only snow place?Though you see some small snow filled places all along ( typically set by resorts / private land owners to attract tourists) . Solang valley is the actual snow point on top of the peak. Do not fall in trap of any tourism operators of they show a patch of land with snow as snow point. Like the bane suggests solang valley is a vast landscape  with snow.What do we need to prepare for before going?a) Remember the place is at high altitude,unless you have any breathing ailments it's safe to travel and have fun there.b) you need to wear snow gear to avoid drenching your clothes and shoes. If you have it well and good and if you dont you can rent the whole set up ( dress and boots) for 250 rs and not a penny more. Gloves,mufflers, and socks will be charged extra c) you easily get dehydrated so keep your self hydrated ( you get water bottles and cool drinks all along)What activities can we do?a) you have zipline (500)b) Quad bike (500 to 800)c) Yak ride(300 to 500)d) skiing ( unless you want to take photo dont go for it as its lot of time waste with balancing, and falling down)e) Para gliding (really exciting costs upto 3000)Make sure you bargain When is the best time to goOct end till Feb end will be the ideal time"
"Solang Valley is very famous for Paragliding, Ice ski, camping and other adventure activities. when I was gone there, I did enjoy paragliding. And I recommend you to go solan valley. Go there and have fun with friends or family."
Everyone would suggest to cover this place at nice you are at Manali. Should visit the place only if you want to do paragliding or gondola ride; paragliding for kids is a fun activity for them. Takes 2 hours from city due to traffic in peak season
"One must visit this place with 2/3 hours time. Take rope way ride though costly. Restaurant above is not that good, but have clean toilets, and may roam around for quite windy with view of surrounding valley and Manali. Some may go for sports activities also."
"Solang valley is best place to enjoy snow as well as the games associated. be it para gliding, Snow boarding or just throwing it. Overcrowded at times."
It was a very lovely view. We rode mountain bikes on five km up and down trip on bumpy Road with stones. Saw people paragliding and enjoying zip line rope way. Had nice hot Pakoras and tea at roadside tea stall. People very hospitable and nice
"if you have never seen snow ever the this place would serve as a great first timer ! with experienced guides and not to difficult terrain this place is amazing ! get yourself clicked and enjoy hot snacks amidst snow ! don't avoid ATV rides , its once in a lifetime experience"
"Visited this beautiful place with friends. Solang valley is away 12-14 km form Manali. In cold season, there is shop to buy a cloth for protection against snowfall. Charges are normal for cloth. There is a large parking area for vehicle. Base camp main food is Maggi and Hot tea/coffee. There is not more option for food. Moter Byke is available there for darshan of Shivlling at top of hill. Shivling is just under the waterfall. View of that combination is great (Water fall & Shivling). Charge for Byke is also normal. Byke ride is awesome. Zipline, paragliding (3000-4000Rs), Byking, all activities are available there to enjoy."
Nice place to visit for entertainment. Rope way ride was good. Amazing view from the height of 3200 meters. Paragliding adventure was there too for adventure lovers. you should try opt to reach the place by 4X4 scooter. It was fun ride.
"While the valley becomes crowded during summer holidays but it still provides lots of fun activities for the family or individuals. The view is fantastic and facilities adequate. early summers and winters are even better. Trekking, zorbing, hang gliding, dirt bike riding are some of the activities you can participate."
"Me and my husband went to Solang Valley in November 2019 on our trip to Manali.Its about an hours drive from Manali and can be done on your way back from Rohtang or Gulaba Pass.There are a couple of activities one can do in Solang Valley. - The cable car ride to the top of the hill- AV bike riding- ParaglidingThere are also a lot of eating options around Solang Valley. Do try the momos and Maggi for sure. Also, don't forget to carry shoes as you are going to be walking around a lot."
"Do your snow activity in Sloang valley, get really crowded , during winter you may not reach the place coz of snow slides and land slides. best time you want to see falling snow less crowd and readability, feb last week to march end.  you can do li bit od snow mobile riding skying and snow driving. the package will cost you from 3000 to 6000 for a pack of 4. better to carry your own gloves . you can rent the dress from many outlets available there. we took almost 4 hours to cover 16 kilometers  coz od land slides and vehicle getting trapped during the month of March. Its a place to visit in Manali"
amazingly beautiful. Nature at its best. Rope way available. Try skiing ⛷ Qudrabikes rides are awesome
Sollang valley has various modes of transport to reach the snow points... Quad bikes (rs.1000 for 2+1) or horses (much cheaper) or cable car (rs.650 per person). We were not sure about rates and so took the cable car up. Though expensive and a bit of a walk to reach the station was relatively less crowded..we got the snow point all to ourselves.. really lovely experience. You can hire the Himachali dress up at the snowpoint for 50rs per person (down below the cable car station a lady was saying 100 per person). There is a basic restaurant on the top that serves the usual foods available in the area. Be careful about rates of everything. Seem to be hiked.
Don't visit this place during Apr mid as you will not able to see Solang valley as shown in picture like lush green. Snow was there but with mud so not able to see white snow and not lush green scenic view. I will suggest to go Khajjiar instead of Solang valley
This is a must visit spot for everyone! Rope car ride takes you to the top of the mountain with spectacular views! Sipping a cup of coffee watching the scenic views is mind blowing. You got para gliding but it is got expensive now. Do not opt for lower attitude para gliding as it is no much fun. OPT for a higher attitude one. You will be gliding for 15 to 20 minutes and make sure you have an action camera with you.You can hire a ATV motor bike rather than a horse where they take you to many places and you could spend your own time with no restrictions and you could also drive the ATV. Avoid zip liner in this place as it is a very short one! There are other places for zip liners.
"Staying at the the Solang Valley Resort was a great experience, staff was fantastic as well as the service was incredible. The Snow fall added to the great experience."
"I had one of the most memorable time of my life . I spent about 5 hours at Solang Valley . Tried my hand at Skiing, Yak ride . Enjoyed thoroughly"
"We left our hotel around 10.30 with kids to see snow n do snow activities in solang. Biggest mistake, got stuck in jam for 4 hours reached at snow activity place (which is actually very small) at 3.30 and sun sets at 5.30, snow has gone all black due to so much foot fall. Also when u take ur special snow dresses on rent shopkeepers will try to convince you to pay price n book all the activities in advance there only at their shop. Never do that. Paid 5000 for a 500 snow bike ride and since we had already paid advance we can not turn back our cars and have to visit the activity location.Visit places on way to rohtang in winters instead of solang.for better snow n beautiful n peaceful time."
"Great location, wonderful scenery with proximity to snow clad mountains and rolling green hills. We had heard too much about this valley but unfortunately felt it was a bit overhyped. Massive traffic jams take the fun out of this visit, most of the times. And the touts along the drive, who sell snow jackets and boots and what not, attire you like a cosmonaut unmindful of the need for it, leaving one hot and stuffy in summer. And the farce of the skiing experience (at Rs.2000 per person) is another dampener. Leave early, by 6.30 AM, to get ahead of the traffic snarls. Don’t bother with the cosmonaut suits if you have a decent jacket that keeps cold out."
Thrill seekers travelling to Manali should head towards Solang Valley for various fun filled and thrill activities like Paragliding etc. It's usually closed during extreme weather conditions. Beware of Touts and unlicensed operators. Safety First.
"So my car was parked mid way to the base where all the activities are conducted. On the way up I was offered to rent out jumper jackets and boots which I refused. I my opinion you should either wear shoes that can grip on ice or simply buy the boots. Jacket wasn't needed at all. Unless you intend to roll over the snow. Which would make your clothes wet. Walking up 4 wheeler motors were offered which again I refused and honestly you wouldn't really need it no matter who says what. It's a joy ride for sure but then that's about it. Do mind that the road leading up is practically a 2 narrow lane road so you would share the path with vehicles. And some parts of the road can get slippery. Watch out for it.On the way there is a Naag mandir. Do visit it.Once you get up there, enjoy all the activities and food. There is an ATM too up there right in the building that has ropeway. When I went it wasn't working though.Now if you want to really experience lesser crowd and more of scenics ... Take ropeway to the next level. They charge 650/- for the ride. Might sound too much but that's what deters most from going up and hence more secluded. What is expect up there is snow, snow, snow and some more snow. Best view I've seen! Snow clad mountains just made my pictures look wonderful.Keep one thing in mind please. These places are good as long as we visitors keep it. I found thrash over there and was disheartened! Did my bit of picking some idiots thrash to protect the place."
"Very nice place where you can enjoy, but as happens, you can see perils of commercialisation over here... too much of bargaining... Deteriorating Hygiene and Cleanliness..."
"Lovely place to visit in December. completely covered in snow. Breathtaking landscape,  several snow activities, including Skiing, sledging, para gliding and tube slides, though some seems a bit more dangerous on a crowded day with low level of supervision. Take a cable car to the mountain top which is bit expensive but one can capture some beautiful pictures away from the crowds. The road to the valley from Manali town is narrow as one goes up, and on the day before the Christmas  we experienced 4 hours in terrible traffic each way. Parking is disorganized closer to the valley. in such a situation better to take a snow scooter ride which will take you to the top through short cuts. Horse ride is another option. perhaps ride a yak ? dont forget to clad yourself with a snow suit, which one can hire from many shops on the road to the valley.Though we do not know how clean or hygenic they are after being used several times.Warm clothing and shoes to walk on snow is a must as the temperatures are minus 7-8. The only cafe at the bottom of cable car serves classy hot food and drinks and a resting place for seniors till the young ones take part in adventurous activities.I wish the Manali City authorities will arrange for disciplined vehicle parking areas before the highest point and arrange shuttle service to avoid unnecessary long traffic blocks which spoils the fun."
"Beautiful place surrounded by nature. Hills and vallies mesmerized ones experience. Even During summer, snow could be found. Snow activities such as skiing, climbing, paragliding, bungee jumping are available here for experience thrill. Recommended to everyone."
"Never saw such a beautiful place before. I along with my family visited it on Dec 17, 2019. My car driver warned that we could visit it only if weather permits. Fortunately weather was excellent on that day. We wanted to go as early as possible while weather was good, but our car driver said nothing would be open before 9 AM. Further, our hotel could not provide breakfast before 8:30 AM! Finally left the hotel premises only just before 10 AM. Then vehicle had to wait for quite a lot of time along the way to the valley as one need to give way some-times for on-coming vehicles. Not only this, it took quite some time to reach the valley due to a patch of slippery section of the road. Due to ice on the road, many vehicles had difficulty in moving forward. We encountered many mountain bikes zipping along the road. Finally, we could reach the valley only at about 12:30 PM. First we tried skiing in a small flat area. There were many people but not too many fortunately. We also enjoyed snowmobile as well. Then we went about hundred meters down the valley where we tried zipline which went down over a river for about hundred meters. The place where the drive ended was simply superb! The entire are was covered with snow a few days ago with a few trees here and there and in between a stream of Beas river. There was quite lot of sun when we reached the valley. It was not cold at all. Many people removed warm clothes to avoid sweat. Played quite some time in the snow. Got many photographs taken by our guide who had DSLR camera. In fact he suggested us various poses for photographs. He said he had snow filter to get very nice pictures and they were so. The place was totally in snow and was extremely beautiful with Solang village at the far end on a slope of a mountain. There was zorbing activity and sliding activity on a tyre tube, but we did not choose to do none of them  as we already had tube slide done at Kufri near Shimla. If you did not have this ride before, I suggest you do at least the tube ride as the riding is better and longer than it is at Kufri. We did a ride on Yalks as well. No paragliding activity was available probably due to presence of snow. After spending about two and half hours we ate noodles and had tea. There were quite a few shops providing lunch in the valley. Toward end of our time at the valley, i.e., at about 3 PM, Sun started disappearing due to clouds and cold weather started. By the time we reached our hotel it was about 4:30 PM. You need to allocate a day for the Solang valley visit.Notes:- 1) Our taxi stopped at Bahang and the taxi driver said his vehicle would not come to Solang valley as we need 4 wheel drive vehicle due to existing snow on the road. He took us to a shop and had to go through agent who supplied snow boots, warm clothing and gloves, etc. The agent also supplied a guide and a jeep as well. Paid for a few rides at this agent itself.  But on the way we found a few regular cars as well!2) The jeep took us to the Solang valley and waited till we finished our activities. 3) The guide was exclusively meant for us. He took us to various places of activities and helped us doing them.4) The guide also offered service of taking photographs using his own DSLR camera for a price. We found this service quite useful. Of course you can always take photos with your own phone or camera. 5) I suggest you keep couple of pairs of extra socks with you as we found our socks got wet some how at the end of our visit."
Very beautiful place with Snow capped Mountains.as usual as it is in India everyone must be careful from getting cheated by People who conduct Package Games. My experience never get into game packages even though your cab driver insist. You will get good cloths n shoes which will protect you from freezing cold for 200 to 250rs. Go to the play ground and then decide what you would to play and pay accordingly. But they accept only cash. If you book a package on pressurizing by your cab driver then you are royally screwed. At the hill top all food items are very coatly. So pls carry sufficient cash with you. Hotel guys also accept cards to swipe. But be careful to protect yourself with sufficient cloths. At the end you will definitely enjoy. One worst thing is Swacth Bharat is complelte failure here. Very bad and unigenic condition. For Ladies it will be worst condition. I strongly recommend to Himachal Pradesh Govt to take necessary action towards basic necessity like good free n higenic toilet and protect tourist from looting game arrangers who are completely private and it is a full loot. It is very good destination like Switzerland but as usual we Indian lack in arrangements and get into looking money. Shamefull.
