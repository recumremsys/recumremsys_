Sitting in one corner of red square this silhouette is world famous. Its actually a collection of churches all built together all with their own story and all different sizes.  A feast for the eyes no visit to Moscow is complete without coming here.  
Beautiful Cathedral. The colours are just amazing. we didnt go inside but the architecture in history in this whole area are just amazing. Do not miss this
Position at one end of Red Square is the very recognisable minarets of St Basils Cathedral. Seeing it in reality is even more stunning than its pictures
Words really cannot express about the stunning beauty of this iconic church. loved it and a must see on the Moscow Itinerary
A fairy tale building wonderfully situated in Red Square. The onion domes are vivid and the interior is spectacular. Listened to a small group singing a cappella which was musically beautiful and demonstrated the acoustic quality of the small interior churches
Looks like a big birthday cake! Really interesting architecture and very photogenic from all angles. Very iconic image of Russia and a must for all itineraries
"This building is an official symbol of Moscow. Of course you may make a photo close to this church, ""Wow, I've been on the Red Square. But it is very interesting inside. Not so many charches you can find decorate in XVI century original style. Enjoy it!"
Must visit place. Any trip to Moscow is not complete without this Iconic structure. The most happening place with the adjoining GUM Shopping Mall. Try the Ice cream inside the Mall.
When you arrived in the Red Square and saw this Church is unforgettable!!!! Is 7 church’s in one!!!! Need see!!!!
"Who knew before visiting that St Basil's is actually 10 churches next to each other within a single outer shell. Make sure you see all of them - my photographs of each in turn showed us we had seen 9 and were able to work out the one we still had to find. Most had a highly decorated screen in them, many but not all had decorated walls, and it pays to look straight up inside several of them too.Thought it was relatively expensive though at 1000 rubles.And, although we don't have children traveling with us, we noted that 'children under 16' were charged too, 150 rubles. Don't know at what age down to they enforce  thisWe were there around 9.40am, Tuesday, and there was no queue, and it was still only about 20 people by 10am opening time"
"Red square area looks best at night with all the lights up in all the monuments and surrounding area.  Don't miss it.  It's very safe at night.  No worries.  Especially during Summer, the sky is still bright and clear at 8.30pm..."
"This cathedral built by Ivan the terrible is one of the iconic structures in Russia. Located at red square and next to the Kremlin, this cathedral with its stunning architecture and vivid colours is a sight to behold"
Definitely a “must see” while in Moscow. A cathedral with a unique architecture and one that will stand in your mind forever.  It’s one of the most recognized structures in Moscow. I seen have seen hundreds of cathedrals in my travels but this one definitely stands out as one of the most unique. There are 9 different chapel type rooms inside to view. It used to be the tallest building in Moscow at one time. Located right in the red square.
"This Cathedral is a stunning building from the outside with the colourful cupolas and the grand design. However, the real beauty of the Cathedral is on the inside with an impressive array of small chapels each with a distinctive character. We were entertained by a baritone quintet in one of the chapels, and the acoustics were great. There are numerous steps to negotiate and these vary in height. Be mindful of your surroundings, and we noticed that there were pickpockets operating in the area. Thanks for your vote."
"Intetesting and beautiful church, an icon on the Red square. Nice paintings and interesting items to be seen."
"Certainly one of the wonders of this world, nothing can be written enough to describe it. Located on the Red Square, it looks like flowers coming out of the floor"
"An iconic location in Moscow, you can't miss this place in the Red Square. It is a must for any respectable DP! Don't miss the yummy ice cream in the GUM shopping centre or the Media Centre in Zaryadaye Park nearby. A terrific 7D show runs there called ""Soaring over Moscow"". Worth the cost, this show is cheaper on week days."
"Situated right in Red Square. Its beauty is beyond description... has to be seen with one's own eyes and photographs do not capture its beauty too well. I ended up going here several times for various reasons, as quite a few attractions are in the Red Square area and thus had the pleasure of seeing the Cathedral at various hours in the day. It is beautiful whether in the Day, evening or night."
"St Basil’s Cathedral was Created in the 16th century, this masterpiece is one of Russia’s most photographed sights. Its iconic mix of colours, patterns and shapes makes it spectacular. SEE photos."
"This is one of the most iconic attractions of Moscow and it truly stands out at any time of the day . Known to be one of the most photographed Cathedral in Moscow , this is a place which is a must visit for all tourists . The GUM mall is very close to the same and also the Kremlin . Even if you get a chance to see this during the day , you should also make a visit when its dark , as the feeling is very different"
"Visited in July.  Beautiful cathedral, even in the rain... :-)See it from its different sides, as there are wonderful views from different angles."
"Such an impressive building,not only outside but inside too. Take your time and wander into the little churches that you will discover inside the main building."
So magical! Looks like a fairytale with such vibrant colours. However it’s more beautiful on the outside than the inside..
"Dominating Red Square is St. Basil's church. Built by a Russian Czar it is remarkably unique with its multiple 'onion domes' and is beautifully painted. It is painted every 25 years or so and I was told the onion domes can change color, hence, older photos will show different colors than what now exist. It is one of the ultimate 'photo stops' while in Moscow. Try it."
That’s definitely a must see when you are in Moscow ! Go at nighttimeIt’s beautiful with all the lights !
Absolutely stunning with onion shaped domes and different colours and patterns. Got to see it at night and during the day  stunning at both times. Very crowded at all times. Did not go inside.
Have always wanted to see St. Basil's and finally made it. To enter cost 700 doubles and well worth it. So many small churches within one we got a bit lost but came upon a male choir singing and it was just magic.Saw it at night too when it was even more beautiful. NOT TO BE MISSED
"The cathedral is obviously a symbol of Moscow and it looks spectacular on the outside. You have to pay to get in (700) and it’s the same fee as the other places but I thought it wasn’t worth it, so didn’t pay. Looking at it from the outside is more than enough."
Impressive collection of several small Russian orthodox churches. Beautiful colorful cupolas. Find small stairs and balcony with wonderful view on the Red Square.
"Really amazing place, the art work, the lay out - all of it is amazing! Defo get an audio guide - it's not too long and interesting enough. To visit in late Sept was a great idea - not too many people around. Buy tickets online and collect them from the ""Online tickets only"" Desk - saves you a long wait (FYI you need cash for deposit on the audio guide - you get the money back - just deposit)"
The symbol of Moscow so is mandatory to be visited at least from outside. Is placed on the red Square the main tourist attraction in Moskow and close to the Tourist-Bus station.
Built by Ivan the terrible and although very interesting on the inside I actually found the exterior more impressive. Only 700 rubles to enter but quite narrow inside so I would go when it's quiet. Not pram/wheelchair friendly.
"Absolutely stunning. Interesting to note St Basil’s is actually 8 smaller churches. Suggest a guided tour to explain the different churches. Beautiful and old and so much history. In the off season, you can grab great photos of St Basil’s as backdrop before 10am, with minimal people in background - after that crowds will get pretty big. My favourite monument in all of Russia."
"Of course, this is the main reason everyone goes to Red Square.  But there are shops and restaurants nearby as well, and people watching is fun.  Be careful of pick-pockets..."
"The exterior of the Cathedral makes for a really great photo background though challenging to capture in its entirety and of course the numerous visitors. Inside, there are a few interesting exhibits and history. Do note that it is actually small inside. There is usually a group…"
