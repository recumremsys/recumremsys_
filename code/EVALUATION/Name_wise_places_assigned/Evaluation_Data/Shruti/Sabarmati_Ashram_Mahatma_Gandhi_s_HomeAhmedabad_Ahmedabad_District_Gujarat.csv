"Visited the historical Sabarmati Ashram in January 2020 with some friends during a day trip to Ahmedabad. Obviously, this is one of the must visit place in Ahmedabad but was very disappointed with the level of cleanliness and security. Should be better maintained considering this is the place the greatest icon of India Mahatma Gandhi set up and led the freedom struggle from."
Walked to the ashram here stayed at The Metropole hotel amazing Experience in ahmedabad. didnt know that this beautiful attraction existed here
"Sabarmati Ashram is a must-visit when one comes to Ahmedabad. Located on the banks of Sabarmati River, this Ashram gives a glimpse of the austere lifestyle of the great father of Indian nation, Mahatma Gandhi. A number of activities were decided and executed by Mahatma along with his followers for the freedom struggle against the British at this place; and you feel connected with an important era of India's history. This Ashram was also showcased prominently in the Oscar winning film, Gandhi (of course, the Ashram was created and it was not shot here). Do visit here and you'll experience peace and harmony; also do not forget to buy some memorabilia like books, gifts, etc. from the shop located in the Ashram."
"Dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi's ashram at Sabarmati in Ahmadabad , this is a must visit place for all Indians . The genesis of Gandhi as a idea and his thought process are vividly captured through pictures and his quotes all over . Very well managed and nicely done ."
Mahatma. Great soul. Being a vastu consultant I believe in good energy. This place has information and art. Simplicity and grace but above all it has peace.
"Its a historic place of Ahmedabad. One of the most tourist attraction in City. All memories of Satyagraha, Mahatma Gandhi.You can buy historic books related to India's freedom and biography. Located on Sabarmati Riverfront. Very beautiful place to visit"
"Highly moving visit to Gandhi Ashram. Site is well kept, gift shop and WC facilities available. Felt safe and secure throughout."
"Gandhi Ashram at Ahmedabad, on the Sabarmati river,is a place which evoked strong conflicting emotions. I felt proud to be in the same place as the Mahatma, but extremely humble when I saw what he went through to give us this freedom that we take for granted. I felt sad to see that things that he fought for was now being negated (secularism) and amused when I saw an exhibit that showed how people sent letters to him. One of the addresses was simply ""The King of India, Gandhi, Delhi""! Despite spending time, I will definitely return one day to learn more about the enigma that he was. Believe me, we are not worth the struggle he put in for us."
"Took refuge in the shades of the ashram to escape from the schorching sun of Ahmedabad. The place is a display of sorts of various events in Gandhi's life,and a small insight into his teachings. The ashram nearby has a khadi centre,where one can volunteer for work."
"Ashram consists of Museum (Gandhi at Ahemedabad, Picture gallery, My life my teachings), Magan kutir (Museum consisting of various types of Charkas for weaving cloth) Vinoba Kutir (A small hut where Vinobhabhave lived), Hruday Kunj (Home of Gandhi and Kasturba from 1919 to 1930). It took around 2 hrs to see the full Ashram. Learnt new things, recalled about independence movement, Gandhiji's role in Indian independence). Don't forget to post a letter or Gandhiji's picture available at book shop to get crossed by Charkha stamp by India post. I received the letter ðŸ˜Š with Charkha crossing."
"Apart from anything else, Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram has a lovely location. Set alongside the Sabarmati River, it enjoys cooling breezes which waft through the leafy compound.There are two main parts to this complex. The first part is a museum which explains about Gandhi's philosophy and campaigns. It does this mostly through the use of quotes from the great man. There is also an effective use of period photography. The second part contains original buildings from when Gandhi and his wife lived here from 1918 to 1930. The simple cottage evokes his non-materialistic worldview effectively."
The house & workplace of Mahatma Gandhi. A place which has witnessed a lot of history. Was peaceful to visit. A brief description of major events of Mahtama Gandhi's life are written.
"I had a lot about the Ashram during my school day and finally got a chance to visit it.   It is a pretty big place on the banks of Sabarmati river.  The river front has been well developed.   The Ashram offered a respite from the hustle bustle outside.    Gandhijis meeting room, living quarters, other people connected to the Ashram can be visited/viewed.  The Ashram is well laid out with parking.  A gift shop is available to purchase many items related to Gandhiji's life.   A small museum with various types of Charkas used is located within the Ashram.  The best thing is that the Ashram is free to visit and pretty well maintained.    Located not far from the airport.   Around the ashram are many handicraft shops.  The Ashram is historical for its connection to Indian Freedom Movement."
A museum full of photographs and printed Ghandi quotes. Well presented but nothing special or different. Location by river. Seems to be more reveered by visitors than natives who feel things have moved on. Learnt more about the personal side of a national figure. Think it somewhere visitors should go
Had high expectations of this place as Gandhi is supposed to be the most famous son of the state of Gujarat. The Ashram is nothing but few establishments including a museum with only graphical recollections. Difficult to get the poignant portrait of the monumental man.
"Located at a quiet place at the banks of Sabarmati River where you can hear the whispers of your own soul.  It is also a place of great historic value, where even today visitors find some of the things which Mahatma Gandhi used -  writing desk, khadi kurta, yarn spun by him and some of his letters...A must visit place if you are in Ahmedabad."
This is Gandhi's first Ashram in India. It is the biggest tourist attraction. Located on bank of river Sabarmati. Must visit place.
"Sabarmati Ashram, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is a fine example of history and struggle. Living up to Mahatma's principles, the ashram is peaceful, clean and beautiful. A must visit for anyone interested in Indian hidtory. A detailed visit to the ashram would take roughly two hours. There are guides/volunteers who explain the history of the place. The iconic 'charka' is placed inside Mahatma's chamber,which is opened 10-25 times a day. The ashram has two stores that sell bookmarks, postcards, pens and other kinck nacks. Have a wonderful visit!"
"Itâ€™s the historical place where Mahatma Gandhi with Kasturba and other disciples stayed long time and started freedom movement to free Bharat from British India rule. New photos and memory lane from the beginning of Mahatmaâ€™s life to the last years. So many pictures depicting Gandhijiâ€™s life style and his tremendous work for our country is seen here. His kutir, Prarthna sthal, kept as it is. Worth visiting to know the history of â€˜Freedom movement â€˜. Maintained as it is. A nice place to ponder over on the bank of Sabarmati River ."
This place was hardly 100 meters from our hotel. Visited this place in the evening and we spent more time in commuting to this place and back than viewing the attraction. Would recommend not to include this place in your itinerary.
House of Mahatma Gandhi. Tells a lot about history and culture. Really inspiring and amazing. Superb location.
"If you're in Ahmedabad and want to spend quality time studying Indian history, it's freedom struggle and the inspirational life of Our true hero, Bapu Gandhi, this is the place you should head for. I assure you, as a tourist, you won't be disappointed with all that Bapu taught us through his life. From his life in a chronological order to his welcoming a dalit family to his ashram to the pain on passing away of Ba (Kasturba Gandhi's pet name) and finally to spearheading the freedom struggle, the Museum is an emotional journey for Indians. Don't miss!"
"Such a lot to discover about Gandhi, his philosophy and his life. Presented really well. Peaceful, welcoming environment. See people spin cotton as Gandhi did and you may even get an opportunity to try yourself.The book shop and clothes shop have good offerings too."
Had a couple of spare hours and decided to visit the Ashram. It was an absolutely wonderful visit. The environment is calm and the property has been well designed. I really enjoyed reading and looking at the photographs of Mahatma Gandhi and his journey and reminding myself of the great deeds he did for India and humanity. A very moving experience for me and would highly recommend it.
It was a very good visit. Walk into some history if the independence fight of our country.Then ofcourse u also see the beautiful river which is maintained very well
"Located on the banks of Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad. It is popularly known as Gandhi Ashram. Has its own museum,Vinoba Kutir, named after Acharya Vinoba who stayed here. Visited by many important dignatories around the world it's a worth visit when in Ahmadabad. It reminds the journey of Mahatma Gandhi and some stories of his family.  How Mohan to Mahatma during all those years. Very informative about history of Indian independence and the struggle led by Mahatma."
"A must visit for all Indians and everyone else. True to the Mahatma the ambience is peaceful. Takes you through the setup of the Ashram, the rules and functions , the Satyagraha , the Charkha, the turbulences and the decisions. Walks you through an inside story during an  eventful period of Mahatma and India's road to Independence. Visit the memorabilia section if you want to carry any remembrances. Spend quality time here."
"You can't come to Ahmedabad and not visit here. Don't skip the museum. It has a very detailed chronology of Gandhi's life, including some wonderful letters."
Taken back in times for One and a Half hours. Laege collection of documents related to Bapu's life. Memorable experience.
"It displays the life of Gandhiji.. has copies of handwritten letters, where he stayed and so on. Do not forget to buy a postcard from there and send yourself. The postal department affix a special charkha stamp which is only available if you send the postcard from inside the Ashram... just a memory.."
"This is the place I have Choose to Celebrate my kids Birthday last year, we spend whole day at Sabarmati Ashram and evening on Narmada Bridge. Place itself gives u a Patriotic feel and very tidy. Place is maintained very well. taken care of each and every bit and tried to take us to back old days"
"Being an Indian, Mahatma Gandhi and (his) Sabarmati Ashram are well known to me. It took me years to stop ignoring Gandhiji. I have read his books and though I disagree with some of ideas, he always gives me something to ponder.I was in Ahmedabad for some work and gladly took the opportunity to visit the Ashram. The museum is inspiring and I kept on wondering how he revolutionized the concept of Revolution. His 'Talisman' (photo of the quote is attached) is my all time favorite.The 'audio - visual' room, the book shop, the river view - everything is nice, cool and thought provoking. Though I would like more security to the place and some display of documentary schedule would be useful.Overall good place to visit and to understand not only Mahatma Gandhi but also India - then and now."
A historically important place. Must see. Depicting the whole life story and patriotic  incomparable life style of Shri Bapu ji. An inspirational place.
"The place is like an open history book, giving a glimpse into the life of the Mahatma and in turn India's quest for independence. Its peaceful and serene on the banks of the river Sabarmati. Gives an insight into how life can be simple yet so fulfilling."
"A place worth visiting if you want to know anything about Mahatma Gandhi. His entire life history is shown. If you go in the evening, you can also enjoy the sound & light show. Please you can carry back a miniature charkha / books from the shop for a slice of history! Really worth visiting. Oh! And so tranquil & peaceful place inspite of being on a main road!"
