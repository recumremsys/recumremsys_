"This temple has many Temples within. Takes about few hours to explore the entire temple. There was a queue to pray to the main deity, Sri Ranganathar. However it was worth the wait to get in to be blessed. Of course there are various opportunities to avoid the queue. One of it is paying to skip the line. The temple has a pleasant and peaceful atmosphere. The priests will explain the history and rationale behind the deities and the positioning and this provided good learning moments while we were there. This is a must visit temple at Trichy and suggest to plan a few hours for this visit. Worth it."
"This temple is dedicated to Vishnu.  It has 49 separate shrines, and feels like it’s own city.  Go in the morning when it is cool.  You have to remove your shoes and pay 10 rupees to the shoe keeper.  There is a charge to go in."
"The colour , sounds and smells of this temple are a sensory overload . This is a very active temple with a long history.  Streets are filled with worshippers , incense , garlands of flowers and the soaring temple itself make for a visual feast. Find a café and just sit and…"
"Dedicated to Vishnu, this is a massive temple complex. The main entrance gate is massive and highly decorates. You walk thru a number of gates before you get to the centre of the complex( where only Hindus can enter). The central parts of the complex are well carve and there are a lot of granite pillars, there is a a large Garuda shrine but no photos. All in all I thought this was really worth visiting.  You can wear socks here and ....... you should as there are a lot of hot stone slabs!…"
Very nice place. Ancient temple. Built by 7 kings and it's the second largest hindu temple. They allow cameras till 3 circle of the temple. Last 2 circles they won't allow cameras but can carry mobile. They charge for cameras and top view. Don't miss the top view where one can see all the 21 gopurams  (temple tower)
"visit the temple at 430 to avoid long queues and take the special darshan Rs 50 INR as it avoids too much queue and is as good as the 250 one.the temple is an standing testimonial to the Hindu culture and houses many small deities inside which will take atleast three to four hours to visit all. evenings are the best time to visit and avoid public holidays as its get excessively crowded.you can carry your camera inside and take photos except of the main deity.a must visit place just to see the sheer massiveness of the temple complex and the ''Gopurams""."
Full of divine vibration. park your car comfortably in the north gopuram entrance. Do not miss to visit Ramanujar temple in the south east corner
"The whole temple is built by granite single stones.The main tower is a wonder , you may feel like this was not built by human being. There are 3 options of Q for darsanam. Free,₹50 & ₹250. Check for the crowd before you opt for 250 Q. Never visit during 11 am - 4 pm. You can't…"
"Reach the temple venue by 6am during weekends so that you wont miss the Darshan as the main deity will be closed for public by 8pm and reopened by 9:30 am only. We entered via the east gopuram (white tower) as it is less crowded to park the vehicle.Be aware that the main deity Shri Ranganathar is big, just behind the Urchavar, many fail to notice and just see the urchavar due to poor crowd management as the priests simply shout at the bhakts to move fastly.You can spend a lot of time in this shrine post getting darshan from the main deity as this temple is full of sculptures, an architectural wonder. It also houses 1000 pillar hall (ayiram kaal mandapam) but always locked up by Aranilayathurai (temple ministry). You can watch from outside, it’s visible. (Check attached photo)Prasadam is good here don’t forget to get to eat the puliyogarai ₹20 and Vadai offered to Sri Ranganathar at ₹15. Enjoy the shrine visit with your family, please be responsible to keep the temple premises clean."
"Visited Temple on 01.07.2018 evening. It was a divine experience to worship lord ranganatha, thayar , chakrathazhvar and udayavar. Had a holy atmosphere and accompanied by a local to knew the details of the temple."
Excellency Temple Complex.  Unbelievable large and spacious.  Had very very good dharshan in the evening.  The whole temple complex is mesmerizing.  Will always make a point to visit this temple.
huge temple with very big gopuram. No.1 Divya Desam temple. Very good architect. Take a guide to go around for 2 hours to take lot of input. Online darshan booking available at a cost of RS.250/ which is high.  Ranganathar in ananthasayana posture. Experienced the archakars are…
Beautiful temple with grand architecture. Happened to witness the morning viswaroopa darisanam which was awesome. Since it was very crowded in early morning we have to take 250rs ticket for the darisanam. It took an hour. Cleanly maintained temple. Very big praharam. Ramanuja temple was attractive. Visit the temple in early morning to avoid heat. We can’t walk in the temple corridor in hot sunny afternoons. One disappointment was the moolasthanam priests were very harsh and they literally push people not allowing them to see the lord even for a minute even in 250 rs ticket. They can be bit soft because all have to worship the lord peacefully. Very big and beautiful temple with positive vibration.
"One of the oldest temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. oldest temple and maintained very well. The temple is counted among the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu. Also this is built so huge that it takes nearly a 4-5 hour walk to see the every bit of the marvelous architecture. Hired a guide Kali muthu available at counter where camera permission tickets are sold. we hired him for Rs.350/- worth the amount paid. very knowledgeable and makes your visit to the temple a memorable one. He can be contacted on Mobile no-9894289163. The entrances of the temples are huge and great. The architectural beauty is clearly evident of the Chola dynasty. Every bit and piece of the built are extremely good. It has taken me nearly 4.5 hours for complete visit of the temple premises. Sesharaya Mandap is exemplary of craftsmanship of our ancestors. The Mandap is adorned by Pillars. The pillars consists of sculptures of wildly rearing horses bearing riders on their backs and trampling with their hoofs upon the heads of rampant tigers, seem only natural and congruous among such weird surroundings. Overall experience is lovely. Must watch when you are there in Tiruchirappalli. Thousand pillar hall still under renovation. Dont forget to visit Mortal remains of Sri Ramanujacharya, more than eight hundred years old."
"We visited the temple on a busy day. Long queue as expected. We took the 250rs ticket to join a faster line. Be mindful if you have a baby / toddler. Carry lots of water/milk & a hat for the child as they can get quite irritated in the waiting process. Try to visit the temple as early as possible, so you can avoid long queues & the sun. It is hard to walk around the temple when it’s hot. It was well worth the wait for us to see the idol. I wish there was a seperate queue for families with small children & older people."
Worth seeing. Need time to enjoy all aspects of this temple which can be considered a masterpiece of art esp the Krishna Temple at the entrance
"There are lot of reviews of the temple. To do justice at least 3-4 hours is required to enjoy the experience of the temple. Do pick few traditional items from the market, we thought it would be available in Tanjore or in town but we could not get it. Nice iron kitchen items and wooden dolls are there"
Huge temple complex of holy atmosphere ! Need at least half a day to cover the visit. Very ancient place of worship. The reclining God Vishnu ji is life like. The golden vimaanam is glittering ! Make it a point to climb  up to  have a 360 degree view of the magnificent temple…
visited on 31 mar 18. it is a hugh temple and ancient one. it is located inside market area. If you don't know tamil you had it. no one understands hindi and english. even guide was not available. no information available anywhere. no one could provide any information about…
"Re-visit to history, Awesome construction of temple with well carved structures.Big idol of Lord Vishnu resting on Sheshnag. Unfortunately you can take photos inside the temple."
The place is exceptional without a doubt. Takes you a good 3h to check out all the temples in the complex. Plus another hour or so(depending on what time you visit ) for the darshan.  Not so good facilities for keeping the camera while going into the inner sanctuary as people…
"One of the biggest Vishnu (prime Hindu deity) temples in the world ! Scintillating architecture married to solemn spirituality ! Visited for the first time in my life and was awed by the structure, the architecture, design and timeless construction. Its the only Vishnu temple having God Vishnu in a reclining state ! It was an auspicious and humbling experience ! A must visit temple site."
temple with beautiful architecture and construction. temple of Lord Vishnu. having history of Ramayana.
Large complex of temples with roof top viewing area to take in scale of the temples. Working temple and interesting visit with plenty to see.
"This is the first and foremost temple for Vishnu's followers also known as Boologa vaikuntam, heaven on earth. Everything here is massive. The Lord is in a lying posture is a feast to eyes. Don't forget to visit Shri Ramanujar where the idol is supposed to be of Shri Ramanujar…"
went there with the family and it was nice experience of visiting the ancient temple. one has to cautious about the visit timing
Had a great experience.Its a big temple with great architecture.Specially for girls better to wear a Indian dress like saree or suit with dupatta. you must carry your water bottles and its a must if you have kids along with you.
"I went on a crowded day,There is no proper management team inside temple. There is no equality. If you have big hands and big pockets you could see the god fast. It is an tiring experience even standing in Rs.250 line. You would forget all this when you see the God. I loved the samba dosa prasadam, hard like rock. Go on a less crowded day to see the architecture of the and to feel the divine."
The Darshan of Sri Ranganatha & Thayar was stunning. Being a weekday it was not very crowded & we could have a very peaceful darshan. The sentry are very cordial & do not rush you.
"Is the management sleeping? No proper organization, yet 250 rs for a hassle free darshan. Seriously, this temple management needs a lesson or two to learn from Meenakshi Amman temple or Azhaghar or Tirupati temple, which are far better organized for far lesser fare. Poor…"
"Very well organised. Neat and clean. Buggy facility available for senior citizens. When not very crowded 50 rupees Darshan Wil give u a quick and easy Darshan. Various types of Prasad are available. Depending on how much you want to walk, you can select the right entry."
Visited Sri Ranganatha Swami Temple In Decembr2017 in midst of Vaikuntha Ekadashi festivities. Was lucky to have Darshan on two days in midst of huge crowd of devotees.
"This is a massive temple that sits astride the banks of the Cauvery River across from Tricky. It is a massive temple that one should not miss and is considered one of the holiest Vishnu temples in the world. Inside, one can see Lord Vishnu in his reclining pose. Do not miss the…"
Avoid going to temple on  public holidays and on festival days. Take a Rs 250/- ticket if crowded or Rs 50 ticket is OK; Make sure to eat the 'Kesari' Pulivogare' and 'Thair saadam' prasad. Kepp the temple clean.
"Had visited the temple some time back, my vehicle was parked on the perimeter road around the temple very close to the temple entrance. While the visit was nice, when i returned to the vehicle, it was broken into and valuables (documents and other items) were stolen. this was in…"
