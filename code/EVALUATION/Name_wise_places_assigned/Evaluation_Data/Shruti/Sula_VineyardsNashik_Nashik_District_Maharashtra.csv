"We had a really memorable stay at The Source Sula Vines. Top of the line service and very warm, friendly and completely service oriented staff. Excellent food. Temperature controlled pool in this season is such a blessing !! Very tastefully done place with a fantastic vibe. All in all a very very pleasant experience. Look forward to coming again !!"
"Property is good. don't understand why people are milling when Sula fails to offer an outing experience. Except wines, the F&B is pathetic. Besides, if one has to order small finger foods its shocking more than appalling display of offerings it has on the First Floor or the Main Building.Being a Vegetarian, I was forced to order Snack Platter. And to my utter disbelief, I was served with some burnt garlic paneer ( 3 cubes), one Dhabeli ( ...Sick) and about 7/8 French fries. I was aghast at the fare for which I was charged a Bomb 500/- buck.Sula should be ashamed of dishing out such pathetic and cheap fare and pinching pockets of unwary travellers.I think someone should stop this Macabre Charade of Sula and stop visiting it. Its a TOURIST TRAP of sort and nothing exciting about visiting the place and planning to spend a day with family.I STRICTLY NEED SOMEONE IN INDIAN TOURISM DEPARTMENT TO TAKE COGNISANCE OF THIS Venue that is fleecing people each day.NEVER TO PATRONISE OR VISIT THIS PROPERTY UNLESS YOU ARE DEPRIVED OF A GOOD WINE....SIC."
"It‚Äôs a good place totally different from the usual run of the mill malls and namby pamby restaurants. Gives u a vine yard feel totally. Entry is Rs 100 per person to stop weird people from coming in. Wine üç∑ tour is Rs 400 per person they make u taste about 5 wines . Tell u  how wine is made and to be tasted . Interesting and educational also elders and kids. Has 3 restaurants. For sNacks , Italian &  Indian . Food is good slightly expensive and over rated by giving fancy names. Has a wine shop and gift shop also . Minimum time required is half a day if u want to Njoi leisurely. Must go if ur in Nashik ."
"Got info about this vineyard from some of my friends. But the place is a hype with no value addition to your GK in vines and grapes. The place is far from Nashik city(around 20 kms one way) with some part of the road having bumpy ride. Telephone nos given in the website doesn't work. There is no information in the website regarding how much v have to pay for the entry, tour and tasting inside the facility. At the gate, v were asked to pay RS 200 per head and assured that the same can be redeemed for any product sold inside. Once inside, V were asked to pay RS 400 per head for tour and tasting of facilities, if v want to sip/taste wines. Otherwise for simple tour, RS 200. As v were about to take RS 200 ticket, counter Guy told that the tour would b just a lecture session as the factory is closed and vining operation starts only from Jan to March. Utter nonsense, the same can be better understood by seeing some YouTube videos!. So v decided to redeem our ticket charges at the gift shop. At the gift shop I checked with a guy named""Yugesh"" regarding lack of information on pricing etc in the website. As I have seen review in quora regarding charges of RS 250 to RS 100 for tour/tasting and the same was mentioned to him, he first denied any such rates and later he accepted that these rates are for students. May wisdom prevails on him as I wonder whether this place is catering to students to make them""future sharabis""!. Further, there is no price tags in the merchandise. When I checked, Yugesh told that they will never put the same, which is unethical.  Absolutel rubbish and the place is manned by baffoons with no manners. Finding the facility with no more than a few props for photography, v clicked some pics for showing off! and left with bitter memories. Seems the facility is interested in fooling the innocent people by charging them the entrance fees which  they will have to compulsory redeem by paying more for some other useless products inside the facility. One may avoid the place and may take cue from the other negative reviews in TripAdvisor about this place."
"Having  authentic information  about wine from farm to bottle it was paradise for wine lovers..  It is properly  Properly managed. The  environment was conducive for entertainment with fine music, Italian and Indian food along with world of wine. There were package included  wine tasting and an opprtunity to explore  from A to Z of wine making and  finally could make selection of your choice acording to taste.Viewing  the beautiful wine yard and the  scenery enjoying  with wine of your taste at the open deck resturant  was a  unique experience..Ensure your visit not a dry day.Enough parking facilities were available."
"Sula vineyards is located in nashik. Well as the name goes, its a boon for all the wine lovers out there. Went there in the evening with friends. Nice weather, slightly breezy. Good food too. There is sula fest which happens in february. (Looking forward for that)"
"Say Nashik City and Sula Vineyards naturally comes to one's mind..Nashik being the wine capital of India.. Sula is the most popular brand and place among wine and vineyard lovers ! They even have 2 Wine Dinning outlets called.. Soma at Sula & Little Italy !There's a sitting deck which has a very serene view of Vineyard and Gangapur Dam Reservoir.A glass of wine and such mesmerizing view is what everyone falls for !Having it's own and different level of reputation as a brand.. visiting this place would require a filled up pocket !My Favorites : Cabernet Shiraz (Red Wine), Sauvignon Blanc (White Wine), Brut (Sparkling Wine), Late Harvest (Dessert Wine)And for the better experience of wine, ask about it's pairing with food to the person serving you.Food: 4/5Wine: 5/5Service: 4/5Location: 4/5Hygiene: 4.5/5Ambiance: 5/5"
"Overall good, but staff at wine bar on the deck is rude as hell, he asked me to get up from my table which was allotted by the manager just because I was going to order food and coffee and not wine and asked me to kill my time by clicking pics.Do not recommend to go on the deck. Rest is fine."
"We visited this place during October for a day. The place is over hyped and very average. Starting with the car parking area was very shoddy and dirty. The wine tour was very average and dont understand why they charge Rs 200 for that 10 min below average tour (does not include any tour to the vineyard itself). The person giving the tour seemed very annoyed at any questions asked to him. We did not go for the tasting since the reviews were not great. The only nice place is the level 1 bar where you can spend some time. Wine store had good collection. But again, dont understand why were they charging Rs 10 for each bag while buying the wine bottle; Of course its not a fine experience. We tried the Italian restaurant which was very average and very pricey. Overall very below average experience; would not recommend this to others."
"My Life; My feet; My WayA must visit for a wine lover. spread over a vast area, the place is nicely organised and has a organised tours for visitors. They have a coffee shop as well as retail outlets inside the vineyard. Do not forget to enjoy the wine tasting experience."
"Hope this message is read and considered for future reference. We attended the Sula Fest 2019 on this weekend and few things that we thought should be shared with your team for betterment and for your company and for the benefit of the Attendees.So traveling the world and being part of concerts organized in other cities and countries helps you to differentiate and pick on the good and things that could be done good in a particular event. Would appreciate if below points are considered while you plan the Sula Fest 2020 or other such events:The Bands playing at the Concerts; specifically for both the days should have been updated on the social forums. Giving a person the option to select the day of attending the fest. It was a regret to be a part of the fest on Saturday when Divine and Shankar Mahadevan performing on Sunday.¬†The Bands chosen for the Fest should have been more popular and known that small town bands of various countries. Even a Local Band playing known songs would have cheered and get the crowd grooved as compared to outsiders playing unknown songs.When we entered the path for Sula we were stopped by the bouncers informing that ahead the car parks were only for VIP. We had to park the car at the ground 800 meters before the arena and take a bus for the place. However; another friend of ours was allowed to park at the arena parking itself (He was no VIP). By the end of the Fest on Saturday, the bus were not available for drops when we came out and we had to walk all the way till the car park with the localities outside passing lewd comments. More over the bouncers at the car park smiling and gawking lustfully. (Total disgust). I wonder what would have happened if any girl would have needed help from these bouncers; would they have helped and made it worst.Instead of mob of Bouncers waiting at the entry points and at other enteree checking whose carry wine from the wine shop; they could have been put for better use. There were drunk and local creepy boys taking the advantage of the crowd and touching and feeling girls making it show that it was by accident. This act is so common in our country and hence precautions and assistance for this matter should be with utmost importance.Washrooms were in the most unhygienic conditions. There were no cleaners around to take care of the most basic need of the day. Sorry to say, I understand this was the 12th¬†year of Sula Fest; shouldn‚Äôt Hygienic be on the Top 3 of your list.There were announcements on ‚ÄúDo Not Litter‚Äù; however what all steps were taken to manager littering? People were smoking and throwing cigarette buds everywhere (having ashtrays at several places could have reduced this to a lot of extend).¬†¬† Dustbins were no where to see except few at the place where food was served; but ppl carrying wine and¬† beer glasses did not know where to throw them near the stadium arena.People came from different cities, bought tickets well in advance, had to make plans on their travel, stay etc. only to take back happy memories and to make plans for another Sula Fest the next year. You could make this event much better if the basics are taken care with importance."
"Been to Sula before- but gets crazy over the weekend. This time- being a weekday it was nice, got the front view at their wine tasting restaurant- limited menu and it is just right because the food comes really fast. With the wine, I like the cheese platter. The chilli chicken was yummy. One cannot go wrong with hummus and pita bread.The vibe, music, staff who knows their stuff, small touches makes Sula a great place to visit.Yes, there is crowd! It has become one of those tourist tick mark places. What the heck! It just feels good."
Visiting during week days would be less stressful as weekends can get crowded.  The vineyard tour and tasting is good.  Food at Sula is expensive but again it is good.  Staff is courteous and if you are accompanied with senior citizens there are wheelchairs available at the venue.  A good day tour and visit preferably around 4 pm as it would not be too hot and you can get the day view along with the sunset.
"Well we just visited there for wine tasting and lunch. The ambience is very tastefully done whether it's the wine tasting room or the cafe or the wine shop. The interiors look chic. We visited Little Italy for lunch. The food was amazing. We had the customized pink sauce spaghetti, exclusive wine, mushroom starter, pizza and brownie. We were greeted at the entrance, Everything tasted delicious,  the ambience and the service was up to the mark. Definitely going back again! Keep it up."
"Staying in ‚ÄòThe Source‚Äô was comfortable and good. You get your privacy and the staff is courteous and helpful. But as regard to the restaurant, the in house for only the guests  is stupidly priced and if you step out to Sula bar and lounge there the local traffic is too much. So much so that it looses the fun of staying in a boutique hotel.I personally would like Sula management to look into the matter of dividing the outdoor entrants to a limit or to make something extra for them. Half of the fun gets lost because of the noise and it gives a feel that you are walking in a crowded street of Crawford market or Linking Road.Food quality is good and you get all the wines to taste and drink.Overall a good experience."
"Sula is probably the most famous vineyard of Nashik. Hence at any given point of time, it's always crowded especially in the evenings. Getting a table itself is a challenge. Wine is exceptional but the food service is quite slow. Avoid Saturdays and Sundays if you intent to enjoy a breath taking view of the Gangapur Dam backwards and enjoy your wine in tranquility. Music is good, so is the tour of the vineyard. Worth visiting. Recommended."
"Been to Sula Vineyard. It is over rated, just for guided tour which is nothing but showing the wine equipment they are charging Rs. 150 each which is of just 15 mts  and they call a guided tour.A small quantity of onion bhaaia is Rs. 256/.This place needs to be avoided. A small packet of chocolate Rs. 180. Hope they review."
"A lovely place if you are looking for a fun filled half day which is good enough to spend at this place. Afternoons are best times to visit and it is best to wind up the day by a sumptuous meal at 2 of their Restaurants. Surprisingly, they offer no discount for the Wine consumed at their 2 Restaurants. Other Vineyards in the vicinity do offer discounts for consumption. The place is well spread, full of landscape and is very well decorated thereby making it very picturesque - both internally & externally. There are two places - Beyond & Space - for stay which are exorbitantly priced, more because of the demand apparently. Booking is required to be done much in advance. Visited this place two times & found it equally attractive both the times. Have now introduced an entry fee of Rs.100 per head which is weird though it gets adjusted in subsequent expenses that one makes inside the complex. They organise trips to see the wine making process - both without wine tasting & with wine tasting. Tickets again are priced exorbitantly for a trip that lasts merely 15 minutes. Other Vineyards in the vicinity do more detailed trips. Discounts offered on purchase of Wine vary from 5 - 10 % and are in slabs of purchase. In my case, though discount mentioned on Bill is 7 %, the actual discounted amount is 6 %. The much awaited and popular Sula Festival must be visited. It is held in Feb. Entry Tickets as cover charge @ Rs.2,400 per day per person (meals & stay excluded) are again exorbitantly priced. But, all said & done, it is a sought after place."
"Having first stayed in Deolali in late 60s, we did not have the luxury of Sula Wines Vineyards, so old friends made it a point to spend an afternoon at Sula, Wining and enjoying the landscaping of the vineyard..very relaxing with a warm and professional hospitality.. Cheers Sula Wines!"
"Went with friends for some wine shopping and lunch at their Little Italy restaurant. Varieties of wine, food was good, tried pizzas, pasta, garlic bread with some wine. Food was a bit expensive. Overall good experience, worth visiting Sula if you are in Nashik."
"Went on the weekend and the place was too crowded. Had to wait for couple of hours for our turn of wine tasting. The tour was good and so were the wines.Had expected lower rates than the market, but they were selling the bottles at MRP. Although they have a very good viewing deck, but with 1000s of people already in the property its difficult to find a spot."
"Was much crowded on weekends, the instructor was very friendly and took us through the entire wine making process.There is a also a 6 wine tasting session conducted by them at Rs. 400 per person. Must go if you want to know and understand different types of wine.The vineyard was large and beautiful with baby grapes hanging around. Wine making process was under renovation when we visited in Dec 2018. Also note there is grapes stamping that happens from Jan to March every year"
"This review is particularly for the tasting room restaurant at Sula Vineyard.This was our first visit at Sula and needless to say we were utterly disappointed. There are multiple examples for what happens when customer centricity goes for a toss. Uber, Airbnb, Flipkart got famous just because they put their customers first because customer is the centre of focus. Talking about the food - the prices were equivalent to a 5 star restaurant and the quality was abhorrent. We ordered for a pizza which cost around 500 Rs and atleast thought it would be large enough for its price. ( not expecting much of the tast ). One can still let fore go the food quality and quantity but the staff behaviour was indifferent towards our needs  Water had to be taken straight from the bottle. No cutlery on the table. Staff would respond after 10 minutes of asking them for anything. In short if you plan to visit this place do not have high hopes"
"We, the bunch of folkes visited Sula Vineyards last few days ago. The Mesmerizing experience ever üëå. All the variety of food and vines are great. Also, the experience of making vine is a new thing to us. That spontaneous girl, I think Ruhu, helps us alot to explore the Vineyard. Hope, we come back again. Till then, best luck guys. Keep it up. üëç"
Decent place to spend quality time with friends. Surrounded by grapes üçáfarm and you can experience the manufacturing process of wine. And also see the unique collection of wine. U can also opt for Tour and taste package!
"Had stayed in  vineyard view room...its lovely. Restaurants are good. the hospitality of staff was excellent.  Good ambience, great staff, lovely picturesque view,and above all very safe for ladies,children and family .One thing I would like to add is if a Pick up and drop facility is added then the hassle of reaching the resort for outsiders would not be there.We three ladies had booked an OLA from Nasik Rd station but the driver on hearing Sula resort cancelled the trip and we had a harrowing time finding another vehicle to reach the resort.As the bookings are done in advance the Sula management definitely knows the arrival of the guests and may offer the pick up  and drop facilityBarring this the trip was beyond imagination!!!!"
Loved the large grape plantation and the entire Sula property. Took the wine tasting tour - very informative. Got to taste some of the reserve wines. Should but the wines from their shop. They have some which are not available in open market. Lovely evening spent with family.
Enjoyed trip which was partly educational.My friends enjoyed wine tasting. The sula fest was also going on but as it was educational tour i could not enjoy it.In future i will try to attained it.
Was here with a large group on a weekend. Being a weekend there was lot of rush and chaos. The place however is well organised and clean. The vineyards are nice. Would recommend the vine tasting tour which happens every hour. Staff members explain and show the vine making process followed by the tasting session where etiquettes are explained as well. Morning and afternoon time is extremely hot and sunny. Carry your water bottles. Parking is available.Had lunch at Little Italy (Veg Only) there. Food was ok. Service was ok.Washrooms are clean and accessible.The access road to the vineyards is narrow but manageable. Would recommend a visit here for sure when in Nashik.
"On a Saturday afternoon around 4pm we reached the Sula Vineyards in Nasik.We were awed by the beautiful of this place. There is a cover charge of Rs.200 per person which you can use to purchase anything at the Sula Vineyards. As we entered, we were welcomed by beautiful decor and a very happening vibe. Do not forget to click some Instagram worthy pictures here. We took the wine tasting tour which started by a tour of the wine factory where a wine connoisseur told us so much about wines and ended with, of course, tasting some wine. They made us taste 6 different wines by Sula and told some really interesting facts about wines. After the hour long tour, we bid farewell to the place with some bottles of wine and happy hearts All in all, we had an amazing time at the Sula Vineyards."
"Sula VineyardsWash away your sins.NashikTired and dirty After Anjaneri , I called Sula to ask  if I can come in my dirty trekking shorts - they said ‚Äòno dress code here just come thirsty üòÄ‚Äô‚ù§Ô∏è ! I did. The lavish #Sula is truly one of its kind. The vineyards welcome you 365 days with stay facilities ( pay premium). Parking is free, you pay 200 Rs to enter which can be reimbursed for any services you buy. I took the #SulaVineyard tour . I was impressed as the tour is designed for Indians who are fairly new to the concept of #wine and they teach you right from how to hold the glass to how one can distinguish between basic wines.  Wine is made from homegrown grapes but the oak barrels come all the way from #California - the best wood for the grapes to marinate in.  #Winetasting was fun and it was a good way to meet other solo travellers. Priced at 400 Rs the one hour tour and tasting was a good investment. Food was overpriced for the taste,  but guess priced correctly for the ambiance! The view of vineyards is amazing as you sit sipping some delicious grape juice. #Sunset is the best time to be here. 6:30 PM is the last tour of the day. I was annoyed by young ‚Äòlifestyle bloggers‚Äô ü§≥who were busy doing photo sessions and disturbing other guests.  I would rather gaze at vineyard than on skinny girls in hot pants and flowing skirts, pouting and trying hard to fit in. It is a vineyard, only way to fit in is to grab a glass and cherish itü•Ç!  I could not have asked for a better way to end the Nashik trip. Kudos to wine capital of India! I did wash away all my sinsüòÅ.#punintended üòå.I am glad to conclude by 3 posts for 2 days in Nashik. Feel free to reach out. Instagram: Tandoori_delight ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏è."
It can't be that a wine lover wouldn't have heard the name of it specially if you are in n around Maharashtra. Very nice place. Do take the tour and you will enjoy tasting different but amazing tastes. Restaurants are also good.
The entire experience was very good..loved the set up which reminded me of Europe. Sitting with a drink in a open space and having fun with your family was the best. Loved this place and would surely come back
"We visited Sula Vineyard after a gap for few years. The crowd of visitors have increased, it does not have the laid back feel and more of a tourist hot spot.Anyway, this review is for the food and service at the first floor restaurant Tasting Room.First the good points, the food is fresh and well made. The Nachos seems to be the crowd favorite and it does not disappoint. The salad was fresh and well made. The Spicy Chicken Pizza was good and balanced without overpowering heat. The grilled fish again was fresh and well prepared, the lack of herbs was the only letdown.Now the service, or lets say lack of it. Do not expect any greeting from the staff or assistance from them for seating or menu. We just sat down and grabbed menu ourselves after waiting long enough. Had flag down a staff and ordered. When food came, the cutlery and extra plates were not provided until we hollered one. Most of the staff was busy staring on their mobile phones. While we were there, the Christmas gift for the staff arrived and that took the attention further from the guests.Sula has done a wonder for Indian wine scene and have many firsts to their name. However, off late it seems the focus has gone off the guest service. For me, I can suffer through the hoards of selfie takers over my shoulder while I enjoy the good wine and food. But not so sure that I want suffer the indifference of the staff for next time. The rating given is for the food only."
Having visited a smaller vineyard we thought the experience here would not be so good - how wrong we were!This is a well oiled machine with so much going for it - you could easily spend the best part of a day here and they have made it fun as well as informative!It‚Äôs probably the best known vineyard in India and having previously tasted some of the wines both in UK and India we knew they were palatable.  However the tasting showed us that there is more depth to their range of wines than we originally understood and even though taste is subjective they have some very good wines!They also have accomodation which we didn‚Äôt know about which I would definitely look to stay at if we ever returned.Don‚Äôt miss this vineyard if you are in Nashik!
