"Loved our trip round the Royal Pavilion, some of the rooms are absolutely mind blowing. Especially the banqueting hall and music room. Incredible.It’ll take you about an hour to and hour and a half to tour the rooms, there isn’t ‘that’ much to see, which is fine, as it’s a perfect interlude to a day trip or a weekend away. Only irritating thing was the ban on photos. I understand that flash photos can spoil paintings etc, but surely accepting no flash photos is fine. There are plenty of stewards to tell people off if they used a flash. No photos is the only reason it doesn’t get 5-stars - forces you to buy a guidebook if you want to look back on images!"
"Absolutely spectacular place to visit and stroll around.  The Banqueting Hall in itself is stunning, the intricate detail in the chandelier worth the admission alone.  A mix of Indian styles outside, Chinese inside, it's a truly remarkable building.If you don't hire the audio guide you're going to miss out on a lot of interesting background to the history of the house and the people who occupied it.  Don't miss!"
"I visited once as a child but had completely forgotten just how elaborate and ornate the decor is in this amazing building.   Built as a summer palace for the Prince Regent (later King Geoge IV), it encompasses all the richness and oppulent extravagances  of the regency period in one building.   This is wonderfully displayed in the beautiful banqueting hall with its amazing dragon chandellier.   The taped guide commentary was easy to use and very informative.   Also had a cream tea in the tea room (very nice)."
Stunning building in a lovely park. The architecture is very interesting and unusual for a seaside town.  Looking forward to a tour inside sometime.
I have visited Brighton numerous times but had never been inside the pavilion.  Visited this weekend and found it absolutely amazing. Each room you enter has a wow factor.  Covid measures in place made for a safe worry free visit.
Visited in December and was stunned by the magnificent rooms and history. Really worth the money to say you have been.
Fascinating to see the interior and all the treasures currently on loan from Buckingham Palace. Don’t miss them
"We thought it was well worth a visit beautiful elegance with bags of history. You can actually feel what it must have been like working there all those years ago especially the kitchen its an insight into what below stairs life was like. Take your time read the information available, very informative."
"The Items on loan from Buckingham Palace certainly complete the Canvass of the Royal Pavillon. Being a resident I have not visited for over 30 years. Prepared to be underwhelmed it was the opposite impact. The loan items on view were astounding, particularly the young woman who was on duty in the Music Room had superb knowledge and was a sparkling host.A modern highlight for me was the replacement AXMINSTER Carpet in the Music Room made within the last 3 years. Brilliant in colour and original design - the skills and artistry second to none. Well done making a ultra high quality replica and allowing us to walk on it!! A truly magnificent project which is worthy of the artwork from Buckingham Palace.Transportation of the Pagodas by sailing ship from China undamaged is a wonder in itself.Tea Room simple with good service. For more complicated food in colourful surroundings. IVY, 3 Mins WalkThank YouCapn Rog"
"Very interesting visit ! If in Brighton it is must as it offers a rare opportunity to explore the mind of a king considered slightly odd.. Difficult to explain or put into words but do go and check it out. Seems George had a huge fascination with anything and all Chinese. It is very well restored after laying in a terrible state of disrepair for a long time. Do give the upstairs tea room a miss, one might be forgiven for thinking you're in Moscow when speaking to a waitress and looking out the window at the same time; the domes and the heavy Russian accent causes that weird sensation. Make sure you repeat your order at least three times, when ordering Earl Grey tea you might also end up with green tea...with an attitude to boot !! And remember to say nastorovia or whatever the heck they say for 'thank you' in Russian..."
Spent a lovely couple of hours wandering round the Royal pavilion and gardens..Absolutely stunning...very opulent. A mixture of Indian architecture  witha huge chinese influence inside...authentically  reproduced/ restored.Highly recommended
"Extravagant, slightly faded palace full of exotica.  Room after room of fantastical design and architecture.  Don’t like Moorish - you might be bored.  But fascinating, over-the-top bit of history that nearly bankrupted the Crown."
"I’ve lived in Brighton for 8 years and this was my first visit! I dismissed it as the place tourists go, which it is, however I’m upset I never visited earlier!We get in for a reduced price living in the area.The Christmas decorations were great, it didn’t retake us long to get around but the history is great. Shame a lot of it is closed off. Cake and a coffee to round of the visit overlooking the gardens made the experience!"
Beautiful from the outside. A Taj Mahal of the UK. Stunning exterior architecture. Did not go inside but enjoyed the sunshine and the view in the park.
"No visit to Brighton is complete without a visit to the Royal Pavillon.  It was my second visit in four years and I felt the old palace was looking a tad tired.  The great chandeliers could do with a good clean.  The rooms were still pretty to look at and for some of us, this is the closest we would get to Royalty My favourite room is the music room.  Sit on the green bench and gaze on the ceiling,  simply beautiful"
"The Royal Pavillion is a Brighton icon, the seaside retreat largely constructed in the late 18th century for the later King George IV.  It is symbolic both of the city with its attractive location on the south coast and of the enduring folly of the 18th century part of the House of Hannover, emblematic of the reckless spending that marked the reign of George IV.The building is hard to miss, it stretches out behind its own gardens facing towards the Old Steine area of the city.  As much as the Palace Pier, the Pavilion is an enduring image of Brighton and one that is a reminder that this place has for a very long time been the playground of those with creativity and ambition.The design both without and within is not at all standard.  The outside has an orientalist visage.  The frontage at a push could be confused for a particularly grand mosque.  There is clearly an Ottoman influence with the minaret stylings and the domed curvatures.  There is little to suggest it is a British monarch's home.Despite having the features of the Near East as frontage, inside it is entirely different.  The interior is decadently designed with a representation of the aesthetic of the Far East.  The Chinese elements absolutely dominate most of the grand rooms and areas.  A curio both outside and in.The history of the building is fascinating and speaks to changing times in British culture.  The deep suspicion of George IV's father was clearly in the air when construction began given the future monarch was under investigation for financial extravagence.  Yet the absolutism of the Hannovers meant he felt it perfectly acceptable to construct yet another overly lavish and exaggerated home.Financial overstretch meant that the Pavilion was never completed.  The interior of the dome for instance never reached conclusion.  George IV just did not have enough money because spending could not be snapped out of thin air forever.  The purchase of this palace of a building by Brighton Council was a wise move because it allowed it to be renovated after the loss of its patron when Victoria took against the city.  Being in public hands meant it had a series of future lives including as a military hospital during WWI with the evidence of the patients and their signatures having been preserved in corners.Now as a tourist location, the Pavilion is restored to a majesty it probably rarely saw during its days under George IV.  There is a slight lack of authenticity about the fact much o what is on display is a replica.  It is hard to tell though as the original features and the new work so beautifully together.The interiors are unbelievable.  This is one of the most staggeringly beautiful stately locations in the UK from the inside.  In particular, the banqueting room is overpoweringly lavish.  The Chinese reds are everywhere.  They add a richness and a vibrancy rarely matched across the country.  The banqueting hall is suitably large with Chinese iconography everywhere, not least the dragons patrolling the roof.  The table setting itself is clearly majesterial.Other grand rooms include the large and small music rooms.  They are not as spectacular as the banqueting section but are nonetheless still beautiful.  The large music room maintains a space that surely was once thronging with revellers.  It is a bit of a shame the organ is somewhat inaccessible but the Chinese drapes, pagodas, and statuettes with the intricacy of the design they contain are just sumptuous.  The story of that room is barely believable.   Twice ravaged, once by fire in 1975, and even less believably damaged by a huge stone ball dislodged by the legendary storm of 1987.  The music room remains a wonder though and has been restored lovingly after those calamities.Other parts of the building are also nice just not as spectacular.  There is a pleasant view from what is now a cafe looking out over the gardens which themselves are amongst Brighton's busiest spots during periods of warm weather.Price is entirely reasonable.  Off-season is better value than peak and residents have a decent discount.Although the Pavilion is in many parts a restoration rather than completely original, the spectacular nature of the design which replicates the original and gives a really great insight into the life of the turn of the 19th century elite and those who worked for them.  It is stunning and well worth a visit."
Months ago we booked rail tickets and paid for a hotel stay specifically to visit the royal pavilion for a birth day treat. Imagine our horror when we arrived to find it with boarded up Windows etc and a tiny piece of paper saying it was closed this week. The only reason we noticed the paper (as we had walking around trying to find the entrance) was because we saw & heard other upset visitors who had read it. There were loads of people who like ourselves had travelled a distance at a large cost. There was a man there from the pavilion who just commented come back on Saturday. Speaking for myself I had booked my last  two days holiday for this year  & paid for my train ticket and hotel stay for my birthday. Saying come back on Saturday was very insensitive and impossible to do. The closure should have been on the website months ago . Shopkeepers in the area were all unaware of the closure and a few commented why didn't the closure take place  in the early months of the year when there are no visitors. Some of the people there were visitors from abroad who booked there plane fares last year. Ridiculous lack of planning to close it this week. Other museums just close one department at a time not ruin the experience for everyone. I would love to hear from them but there doesn't appear to be an email address only twitter and Instagram which I don't use.
One will be mesmerized and bedazzled by the opulent this palace offers. Step into the outrages world of the Far East. You’ll need some time to digest and savor the many splendor found. Money Worth spending.
Loved this place. Really beautiful. Great historical facts and knowledge shown by staff. A great experience
"Visited here today. Entry fee is £15 but boy is it worth it!It is absolutely spectacular! The grandeur is off the scale and just recently many of the original pieces that decorated this wonderful building have been returned here from Buckingham Palace.It’s full of Chinese themed furniture, vases and lamps which are a wonder to behold. I found myself exclaiming holy moly to myself as I wandered through the awesome rooms. A royal palace it certainly is.Wait until you see the kitchen and King George’s rooms!"
Wasn’t sure what it would be like. First visit to Brighton for 40yrs. Fabulous restoration. Well worth the visit and need plenty of time to appreciate the details. Also great tea room for a sit down. Would love to come back for some of the functions in the future.
"After visiting the Queens Gallery exhibit  ""George IV:  Art  & Spectacle,"" this was a wonderful follow-up on the life of George IV.  This pavilion was designed in a unique Indo-Islamic style on the outside and amazing Asian-influences inside.  This place that was the Prince Regent's getaway was redesigned between 1815 and 1822.  It is also the home where he placed many of the numerous art pieces that he collected over the years.  Just recently, many of the treasures from the Queen's Gallery & Buckingham Palace were loaned to the Royal Pavilion and you can see many of the items in their original setting until 2021.  The beauty of the place and its contents as well as the banquet served and entertainment provided was made to display the king's wealth and opulence.  Be sure not to miss the gallery of satire and cartoons on the top floor.  In his day, he was ridiculed and criticized because of his extravagance, excesses, and profligate life.  But the art items that he acquired are truly wonderful."
"What an amazing place to visit, staff are amazing. Don’t be put off by the scaffolding outside the inside is a place well worth wearing a mask for and social distancing."
"Walking through Pavilion Gardens to have a look at the usually beautiful pavilion and was dismayed to see it's got, what looks like brown mould, over a great area of the building outside at the back where the entrance is to go in.Why has nothing been done to sort this out?  It really looks bad - something needs doing ASAP.It's very sad to see the Pavilion in such a poor state."
Extensively restored and absolutely beautiful inside. Get the Audi on guide for an immersive experience. So worth the visit
"Visited with the benefit of an Art Pass (free entry) - amazing insight into how Royalty lived - honestly hideous in parts, but also fascinating to see the kitchens and the more opulent rooms. Nice guided walk-through - only shame was curtains on all the windows so did not get to see the views, whatever they were. Worth a visit."
"I guess it's the most notable thing in Brighton. Looks interesting from the outside. On the inside the decor is gaudy and pretty tacky. Interesting almost for that reason alone. I got round the two floors in under an hour. Maybe because it is relatively young for a Royal residence, it doesn't have the history of some of the others. The colour scheme and whole atmosphere lacks a bit of class but it's something you really should see if you're in town so go for that reason alone. It's unique I suppose but not for the best of reasons."
"Lovely place but two rooms were closed for restoration, disappointments as should have been notified when purchasing tickets. Spectacular rooms. Advise you pay for audio to understand what your looking at. Can get this on a two for one when traveling by train. Lovely place to visit shame two rooms closed"
An amazing palace. Worth a visit. 😊 We took advantage of the National Rail 2for1. It would be good if a few more areas were open to the public. However the rooms available to view are amazing. Go now while they still have exhibits on loan from Buckingham Palace. 😊
"What an amazing place to go the outside looks amazing enough but waaaw inside is just out of this world so much to look at in every room. We had a phone each which told us different things in different rooms which is highly recommended for only £2 each learn so much. Stopped half way through for a tea and coffee the staff were friendly, smiley and made great drinks and the cakes looked amazing but I was for and didn't have one. Will definitely return here in the future :)"
"I had visited Brighton several times as a child and never actually been in the Pavilion. Loved the history but just expensive. My son had decided to go study at one of the Universities, so my husband, my over 18 daughter and I went to visit him and see some of Brighton. Brighton students get a resident discount, the online discount of 10% has to booked the day before which very much advanced booking not just an online discount. If you are visiting a resident why not offer a family discount to them too? Over £50 for two adults and two students when one lives there for a couple of hours on an autumn day a bit of a rip off. Nice place but really need to reconsider the pricing structure. Surely a place like this should be fundraising for restoration funds not just fleecing visitors. Such a shame. The family rate should include students as you have two universities, you really should be encouraging family visits. Just because your kids are over 18, does make than financially independent. No indoor photos as you can’t even do that!! Certainly wouldn’t come back and perhaps this is why my parents never took me as a child despite having relatives only living 5 minutes from the palace🙁😩"
"Have visited before but never tire of the splendor! The staff in each room are very good, giving detail that wasn't in even the detailed audio guide. They obviously love their job and take pride in what they do."
We were fortunate enough to have tickets for the Tunnel Tour given to us. This amazing tour of the network of underground tunnels used by serving staff and by the king to visit the stables and ladies of the town is a must. Our guides Terry Reece assisted by Derek Bradfield were incredible and bought history alive with their in depth knowledge of the Pavillion. Check this tour out it doesn't happen often.
"This was a great castle to start with - good history, good stories, good exhibits.  Then we went to the ""home"" - just a traditional family home - not at all! The living quarters were unbelievably ostentatious, impressive, and amazing - the guide was a hoot!  Had us all in stitches with his wit, AND he knows his stuff.  One of my favorite tours ever."
"Wow! Loved this place, stunning over the top elegance and well worth the admission price. Not too busy, we went around midday and spent an easy 2 hours in wonder!"
