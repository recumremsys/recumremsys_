I had like 2hours in the city and I'm glad I chose to walk here. Its amazing. So many colours and shapes and well maintained park. Has a magical vibe :)
Very nice place just to walk and unwind. We went down various paths and the gardens were well kept. Ate at the kiosk near Jardin Tan and had a great vegetarian roll.
"The walk around the lake is really nice, hard to remember you’re in the middle of the city! Bring a camera!"
I used to live in Australia and miss the parrots.  You can find them here!  Beautiful gardens where it's great to walk around and the birds are everywhere.  Heard many kookaburras too!  Really exceptional place to just walk around and enjoy.
"Visited the botanical garden during our stay in Sydney and it was a very pleasant stroll with many things to see.  It doesn’t cost anything to walk around and view, so there’s no need to spend money on a tour.  Great views of the opera house, and so many plants, trees, and wildlife.  There were lots of cockatoos just walking on the grass as well which was very cool.  I would say you can spend about 1-2 hours walking around as there are many great photo ops."
This is a wonderful green space in the city. Absolutely up there with any other botanical gardens I have visited in Australia or other parts of the world. Well signed and labelled. Spent a happy few hours exploring and also just sitting and reading and people watching. It helped that it was a warm sunny day but worth a visit whatever the weather for the magnificent trees
"Nice gardens. Shame it isn’t open 24 hours. I was up early and had to wait for ages until they opened the gates. But once inside, it was a nice experience."
Really enjoyed walking through this Garden. Very beautiful. Didn't get to spend as much time as would like to have. But a must see when in Melbourne.
"Being born in Melbourne I have always loved the Royal Botanic Gardens.  There is usually something new to explore or just seat peacefully!  If you travel to Melbourne the Gardens are a must see and experience, highly recommended.  Check their website for more information."
"A must if you like gardens,  we went on a beautiful sunny day.  Setting is astonishing.  Beautiful.  Would come many time over."
"Why we don't come here regularly is madness, as our 3  visits since Christmas have been uplifting. We get there early and park in Birdwood Avenue and purchase a parking ticket - up tp 4 hours.  As we enter the gardens (which are free to enjoy) we pick up a map, get our bearings, and decide which route to take. There are also brochures detailing the many events  held in the gardens -especially in the summer. We like to go through the delightful Fern Gully then make our way to the tea room - The Terrace - where we enjoy a coffee and a sandwich overlooking the stunning water lilies and watch the Gondolas punt passengers around the lake.  We also take our little dog with us; I think its his favourite place on earth.  Take along a couple of slices of bread and feed the ducks.  The gardens offer different displays such as the cactus around The Volcano, Chinese collection, Oaks, South African, Australian Forest walk and others.  They are all beautifully displayed and maintained as are the lawns and grounds in general.  The gardens are a relaxed and peaceful destination just a short distance from the CBD.  How clever were our forefathers to set aside and develop this wonderful area for nature. The RBG will definitely be on our agenda for regular visits throughout the year."
"Nice and relaxing place to visit. Although read about the steep prices in the cafe forgot to bring food. You only forget once, prices are well and truly horrendous. Walked back to the city via King's and Victoria gardens. Well worth it!"
"It's just south of the CBD so really, in the city, which makes it easy to get to from either the downtown or the areas south.  It's a huge oasis offering whatever you're looking for with respect to nature and gardens.  Lots of wonderful programs are offered as well including Shakespeare in the Park, (Wind in the Willows is performed for kids and families, Hamlet for adults in the evenings).  The Meditative Forest Walk is well worthwhile for grown-ups; quite magical.  Don't miss a visit starting with the beautiful Visitor's Centre where you can get the info you need to explore the park in the way you choose."
"It is a really nice place to walk. Trees and flowers are amazing in a peaceful and quiet place. Grab your camera, sneakers and go!"
Visited here and walked around these gardens very beautiful and peaceful. Easy walk and well worth visiting.
Walk around the many paths with lots of beautiful plants of all types. Difinately a worthwhile experience.
We did the $10 per person 30 minute bus ride and it was great.  Amazing gardens. Looks like a great place for weddings.
"Have not been for a few years. Enjoyed every moment in the gardens. Well worth a visit, very relaxing."
"Stopped in on New Years Day 2020. The park was full on a warm day. Many people had found spots under trees and by the lakes. It is a beautiful place to walk and stroll. We started by first visiting the war memorial across the street which is worthy of an hour's visit. The Gardens are a delight to walk through. We especially enjoyed walking by the lake, getting a coffee from the concession stand by the lake and seeing the boats float around on the lake. The grounds and plants were interesting and the view of the Melbourne sky line was good. Give this place 2-3 hours on your next visit to Melbourne. It is worth the time and the peach and relaxation it offers the visitor."
"Brought my small family there on a beautiful sunny  and boy we had a good time. We actually planned for visit to the park and then to the Shrine of Remembrance as it's close together. There is a few trail/walkway that you can choose depending on the time you plan to spend there. Don't rush,  walk slowly, enjoy the nature, look at the scenery. Take it all in!!"
Relaxed gardens right in the city centre. Escape if a worker and escape into nature if in holiday. A rich mix of plants on gentle rolling lawns.
Was much smaller than I expected but was beautiful.   Good place for pictures and very peaceful.   Highly recommend if you are in the area.
Great spot to visit in Melbourne.  Go for a run around the gardens (The Tan track) - or just walk around inside.  Great views of the city beyond the greenery.Very nice.
Visit was just after the park reopened after the Covid closure. Was busy but generally people were social distancing and wearing masks
"I love the Queen Vic Markets, all the colour, the food and the culture. Put this on your list It’s a must visit."
A great place to stroll through on the way back from the Basketball to St Kilda rd. So peaceful. What a pleasure to live in greenery again and hear birds. Shame the Tea House was closed for a wedding though!
"Visited the gardens with family members aged between 11 and 80 years old, and everyone  enjoyed the half day trip. We also loved the cafe next to the lake for our light lunch."
Simply lush. Spent the afternoon wondering round and then took the path by the river back into the city. What a glorious garden to have so close to the hustle and bustle of the city. Would 100% recommend for some peace and quiet! Lovely!
"Very enjoyable walk around the gardens.  Lot of signage to help understand the plants.  Recommend as a ""fair weather"" attraction.  Cafeteria on site was fast and reasonable."
"A wonderful tour led by heart warming Den. Learned about plant history in the context of Aboriginal Australia but mainly about strength, forgiveness, listening and understanding. Everyone should do this."
"As the title of my review suggests, this is really a beautiful place. Imagine thousands of different and wonderful plants from all over the world all gathered next to each others in this impressive Garden. Must see!"
If you are visiting Melbourne or even having a staycation don’t forget to get out into the beautiful gardens close to the CBD. Finish off with a punt ride - so relaxing ...
This is a beautiful place to have a peaceful experience and a place to learn. Get a group of friends and make it even more fun as there are plenty of places to have a picnic.
Saw this park on the map and thought of Regent Park in London. This park stands on its own. The Royal Botanic Gardens have a collection of plants from around the world and the architect laid it out in what was then a revolutionary pattern of curves and trails. I happened in right after a heavy rain and the smells and sounds were amazing especially in the Queensland rain forest section. It's a sensory experience. The succulent garden around the volcano (a reservoir of water runoff to contribute to sustaining the garden) was spectacular with all sorts of different colors and patterns. This is a well put together and maintained garden with all sorts of activities to attract you.
"Had one of the best tours this Wednesday afternoon at Royal botanical gardens in Melbourne. The tour guide was very friendly and very knowledgeable of the plants that grow in the garden. She also provides interesting trivia of each plant and she also knows the scientific names of most Australian plants that are grown there!! Although the biggest let down in the tour was the limited time inside the herbarium. Regardless my experience around the botanical gardens was mesmerising, I particularly liked the small lakes and the well vegetated cover in the Fern Gully."
