"The monument is set in public space full of greens and with many people around, in the heart of Ufa. There are beautiful view on the mound on which the monument is set. Don't miss it when visiting Bashkortostan."
"The largest horse statue mounted on just three supports depicting a national hero of Bashkortostan is must-see. The park around is also good for outdoor activities. Recommended time of the year is Indian Summer, when you can see all the colours nature has to show behind  the picturesque Belaya river."
"Created in 1967 and rated #2 in EU the monument is still one of the biggest. The site is high over the bank of Belaya River and really wonderful - only a little restricted view on West - East and 20 to 40 km view South direction, supervising city surroundings, woodland hills, the Mouth of Dema river and Railway Bridge first constructed more than 110 yeras ago... Remembering our walks here in childhood and schoolyears we often visit the Monument now, wondering with colourful sunsets, small ships far below on the river in summer and and ski tracks on the ice and trees covered with hoarfrosy in winter... YES, it's surely must visit and maybe most remembered place in Ufa."
"It you are in Ufa in summer time, this is the place which you have to visit. The view is breathtaking and there are lots of Spice to stroll. Don't miss it"
"On a snowy February evening we went to see the largest horse statue with a horse standing on three legs (!).  Funny but the horse - and rider, Bashkir hero, Salavat Yulaev - stands tight on the edge of a bluff facing the White River. So close that I couldn't get around to the front to take a better picture. Coming back when the snows gone and it's warm."
"Breathtaking views, amazing statue and a beautiful park.The statue of this hero is a must to see. Come here and just enjoy of all that is offered"
Well worth a visit mainly to take in the magnificent views over the river and forest  below. Surround by fountains and flowers
Loved it! Great place at night))) good place to go before you head out to a club or bar. Great place for photos
