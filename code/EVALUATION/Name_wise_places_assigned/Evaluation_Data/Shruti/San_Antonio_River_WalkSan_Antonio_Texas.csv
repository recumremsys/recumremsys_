Parked at the mall garage and stated walking. Restaurants galore. Some very pricey. We had lunch at Salt creek. Than took a 30 min. boat ride. Weather was warm but it was a really nice afternoon.
A nice Two days spent enjoying the town.  Took the hip on and hip off bus.  We stopped for Texas barbeque and enjoyed the sights of the town.
I nice walk along the San Antonio river.  Has a lots of restaurants and shopping.  It can be rather busy at dinner time.  It is a must do when in San Antonio.
Not for children in my opinion. Mostly restaurants.  Touristy but pretty. Is a bucket list item for me though. Be aware there are birds in trees everywhere on top side streets and river walk; and poop everywhere under the tree on sidewalk. Lots of homeless people lying around. Wouldn’t come in summer. Perfect time of year temp wise. Not crowded  at all. Stayed in Homewood suites on west market street. Was good location.
Stayed at the Hilton Tru Hotel just a few blocks from the Riverwalk so we were able to spend 2 days exploring.  We like eating and drinking so this was a real good experience for us.  Met some friends and wondered around and had a nice time visiting various pubs and just enjoying the atmosphere and the music!
"Make a reservation!I was taken to this beautiful resturant on a date. It is very eclectic,modern,romantic with a beautiful evening tone. The food!!!The FOOD is equally delicious!!! We started with the Grilled Squid then Corn Ravoli, Eggplant Parmesan, Grilled Cauliflower.To full for desert on this visit.The prices are a good."
We are here for a work event. Staying at the Hilton on the River Walk. Love this entire district area. Great food and fun entertainment.
Beautifully designed. Lots of restaurants and bars. A few shops but not what I expected. Still a nice walk along the River. Watch little ones as there is nothing between them and the river.
So many miles of gorgeous scenery. Rode from hotel up to the Pearl District and then then further south. Walked along it multiple times during the trip. Nice to get lost and people watch and enjoy foliage. Very safe and well maintenanced.
"Multiday stay at the Hilton Palacio del Rio.  Walked many steps on the Riverwalk. Great for people watching.  Lots of good shops, restaurants and bars throughout.   Highly recommended."
"Went on a mini vacation with 4 kids and enjoyed the view. It was a short trip so we weren’t able to walk all of it. Most of what we saw was restaurants, bars, and small shops. Once you make it past that it’s peaceful to walk. We didn’t make it on a tour boat like we wanted but have plans for that next time."
"Loved the walk. In fact we stayed close to the walk at the Agave Apartment, 633 S St Mary’s St. We went for a soothing walk morning and evening. The boat ride looked interesting but not sure it’s worth it during these times of COVID. The line for it itself made us rush past that area, as we try to avoid crowds. Loved the natural waters with the ducks swimming around."
"Its a must do in San Antonio. Drop off at the Pearl and  visit the lovely boutigues and bars or stop at on of the many cafes, shops, and restaurants along the riverbank."
"Great venue with numerous options for food, shopping and entertainment.  Felt very safe which is always a good thing."
"Lots of foliage, restaurants, and bars. Found a lot of neat places even though some of it was still closed because of the plague. Few homeless people frequent it but they are harmless."
"First time in San Antonio. River walk is a happening place. So glad we bought tickets for the boat tour at the river walk, it was more expensive on line. We went early when it was less crowded and enjoyed the 30 minute boat tour.  Sort of disappointed, we thought the ride would be longer and could see more of the river and downtown. You only need to do this once, or would skip if ever return. A lot of places to eat and shop along the river walk, very touristy.  Went to the Alamo in afternoon and it was super crowded, go early to avoid crowds. The outdoor presentation was great and well worth the 30 minutes. Beautiful grounds and right downtown.  Definitely know what is happening local before you go, live shows, ballet, and concerts happening right downtown."
Loved the double decker! Kat was friendly helpful and knowledgeable! Great way to see the downtown area.
"Have visited the River Walk literally a hundred times!  Never a bad meal, the restaurants keep their quality up and avoid ""tourist trap"" cuisine!  Sometimes the hardest part is deciding which place to eat at! Entertainment options from Jazz to comedy, and of course the walk is lovely.  parking options have improved to if you don't take ride option.  Enjoyed the boat/meal cruise a couple of times too. A must do stop when we have guests in town!"
Enjoyed strolling through San Antonio using the River Walk instead of fighting traffic on the sidewalks. It leads to alot of great attractions and fairly easy to navigate with plenty of access to street level
"It’s a gem of San Antonio - nice flowing river, restaurants and shops which are amplified at night. Want to just have a stroll up or down the river? Avoid the shops and take a stroll north or south - incredible feature of the city with museums, art and theatre literally steps away from the route."
"Do your research on restaurants/bars before you go.  Going by reviews some of the restaurants that looked like they'd be good walking or cruising through don't rate very well.  But the ones that have dining right along the walkway you can see if the food looks good while you're walking through.  Driving around downtown the next day we noticed that you'd never really even know it was down there, it's just like driving around any downtown."
"Love to walk the river. Lots of restaurants, bars. Take a boat ride or just simply people watch. Can be crowded at certain times."
"We spent an afternoon here and ate lunch over looking the river, which was nice.  Didn’t do the boat ride, due to kids being tired.  Many places to shop, eat and drink.  Lots of pay-to-park places, but cost us $20 to park.  Walking distance to The Alamo."
Such a great place to visit with bars and restaurants all along the riverwalk.  Have been here twice now within a few years and will definately return.
"The river walk was very scenic. It was more than I expected. The river is more live a canal that splits to sides of various restaurants, shops, lounges, clubs, and other entertainment venues with Texas flags flying all over the place. Surrounding the shops are tall hotels and other high rise buildings giving it a flavorful Texas feel. I had a good time on the rive walk. Whenever I go back to San Antonio, I’ll definitely pay another visit."
"This is a huge tourist destination. Or is that trap? Go off hours. It’s one overpriced, tacky restaurant after another. They say it’s no smoking but some restaurants have built 2nd floor balconies to get around the rules. Lots of drinking. It’s a cool idea in theory but be prepared for a lot of people jostling for bar space."
"This is pretty much a very long walking mall with a river next to it. Yes, it was history and you can ride the barge down the river, but let's call it what it is. However, there are loads of restaurants to suit any appetite. Be wary if you take the sidewalk ""above"" the riverwalk as there is a pretty significant homeless population and many places are under construction."
Excellent job by TC.  Made the visit fun and informative.  Learned many new things about San Antonio.would recommend the service for everyone.
Walked the sides but the boat tour (30 min) was awesome. Lots of history and trivia. Eat and drink to your hearts content.
We had a very romantic river barge ride. It was an evening ride with the river lit up spectacularly. Enjoying our hot coffee and people  watching. Amazing restaurants all along the river.
Took a stroll around the river walk. It feels like Italy. Beautiful gardens along the way. Colorful tables out in front of the restaurants . Little shops along the way. Took the boat ride and the driver was fun and very knowledgeable  of the surroundings. Many awesome bridges to go under made for great pictures.
Loved this place. We’re from Atlanta and we don’t have any place this nice in Atlanta. This River Walk stretches for miles and you are only limited by your walking abilities. Always close to shops and restaurants.
Loved the river walk.  Restaurants along the way are a bit expensive. But the river walk itself is very nice. Especially when you get away from the touristy areas.
"San Antonio is a great place to chill especially at the River Walk.  Go to a Mexican Restaurant on the water, have a fabulous Margarita, and listed to Mariachi music!  Life does not get any better!"
"If you’ve never been, you need to come to SA to visit!  Lots of Mexican culture & tradition. Very nice for all ages. The Riverwalk and it’s story are very interesting and will give you memories for a lifetime!  Be sure and visit at night, too!"
