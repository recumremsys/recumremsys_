The ship is an amazing work of art. I loved the tour. Considering the time it was built this is a piece of equipment ahead of its time. The canon display is magnificent and the public circle is very clean. Nice place to visit when in Voronezh
"Guided tours, only. Apparently scheduled on the hour.  Excellent tour throughout the three stories of the completely equipped and furnished ship. Knowledgeable Russian speaking guide. Photos, including flash, permitted from time to time. No restrooms available. Rather long, hilly walk from most hotels; do not attempt this in winter. Taxis are economical, but pick up at the ship may be difficult even for Russian speakers, unless sure of the address. Ask cashier for assistance."
