House made of glass. Amazing work of historic architecture and glass used in it makes it awesome. Stand out there and u will see thousands of ur images there. It’s really must visit place.
"The careful details of the architecture, the stone work, the layout...such art, such beauty. Don't miss."
"A fantastic construction using imported peices of glass, the reflection when light is shone is simply awesome ! Do not miss it, Hire a guide."
Imagine the stunning display of gold back in its heyday! Even now you can see how special and unique each space is.
Have you ever dreamed of a building whose interiors are made of pieces of mirrors. If not then please visit this place and you realize why so many visitor comes here every year from all corners of the world. It's just amazing!
"With some of the places damaged, one can still enjoy the beauty of that the glasses created in here. I can think back in time to think of the beauty created by the lights. Wow! Do remember to visit this wonderful place."
At first I would like to admire the artist who made it. It's really awesome design. Made of whole glass. This is amazing. Great place. Recommended.
"from the elephant ride up the hill to the courtyard I was awed by thes structure.  some of teh highlights1 you are mombarded with people trying to take your picture as you climb up the hill.  The vendors will try to sell you the book of pictures.  It was my most uncomfortable ride yet.  you sit sideways and it feels weird nit being able to get a good feel in the chair.then you are helped off and welcomed by wonderful music and 5 million ( exaggeration) vendors selling pictures of elephants painted on silk, quilts that look quite charming but too big to carry home, marble carvings, and wooden carvings and who knows what else....If you look around there are many tour groups up there and  a few darling school kids on field trips The Fort is a Mugal structure and has many sections.  The open spaces and the  columns holding up teh buildng are beautiful.  The walls of the corridors shine as they are made from some sort of marble paste.  They also reflect light and they also are cool to the touch.  I loved some of the paintings high on the walls of the womans section.  They depicted daily life and even some Kama Sutra images.  you need to look carefully.  The room of mirrors was breathtaking!  the inlay work was intricate and beautiful.  The skill adn craftmanshhip was like none I had ever experienced.  The stone steps in the hallways are uneven.  be careful.You overlook the valley and so you can see amazing secenery from the roof patios.  This structure is huge.  It is at least a 2 hour comitment.I would retrun there is a heartbeat."
Was a very good visit. Never seen many mirrors together  beautifully laid out.this is a must see..It was interesting to know that just one candle was enough to light up the whole place.
A palace of Mirrors….  A palace which will not be remembered because of its size but for the craftsmanship.. Millions of minute glass pieces fixed one after the other is absolute symmetry.. Reminds me of a grand bridal lehenga.. a little light and all sparkles together to create magic.BAD NEWS – This is a World heritage site so Government is getting this renovated. This is closed for Public at the moment.Good NEWS – Your guide can get this opened for you to glimpse for a nominal charge. Then if he lights a candle – you will see the magic !You will hardly understand anything standing outside and peeping from the closed doors..
It is difficult to describe it as it has amazing art filled with small mirrors. Don't forget to take a picture while you are looking into the mirrors when you visit it in Agra.
Part of Agra Fort and the Taj  Mahal story.  Knowing the story will  enhance your experience immensly. Some sort of information guide should be  used to help you as there are not many storyboards.
"Has to be seen to be believed. Incredible workmanship from                           so long ago, amazing quality and beauty. Photos do not do it justice."
Very ornate.  I am not sure that this should be differentiated from agra fort however.  Seems like this is just part of agra fort.
Do visit the Agra fort and view all the splendours it has to offer. The sheesh mahal is one of them. Its decorated with exquisite mirror work all over the ceiling and is a pleasure to behold.
The sights at the Agra Fort are almost limitless.  Perhaps the most beautiful and sparkling is the Sheesh Mahal.  Inlaid with mirrors and mother-of-pearl the area abounds in reflections and detail.
A must see place in Jaipur.The architecture is mind blowing. The place is always crowded. Take time and go through the place.
A real surprise so do not miss this. Check out the fine mosaic mirrored walls and ceilings. Our guide was informative and this made it an interesting experience.
"The Sheesh Mahal is small, but one of the most eye catching buildings inside the Agra Fort. Its interior is currently closed to the public, unfortunately, but one can and should take a peek inside. A large number of beautiful mirrors on all sides line the walls and even the doors. It is located next to the Khas Mahal and the Mussaman Burj. Spend around 5 minutes here."
Adore your beauty with thousands of reflection on this fine piece of art. Each mirror had a story to tell and secrets to reveal. Where mirrors are forged from the desserts of all the Middle East to cast this beautiful imagination.
Wow ....how were these places built all those years ago. The Sheesh Mahal will take your breath away I was mesmerised. Do not miss this trip.
"Part of the Agra fort that is located at the rear. Made from white marble, just like the Taj.The craftsmanship is amazing."
Such fine architecture. Sends one off to a different time zone of the Moghuls. Definitely not to be missed.
"Another Palace of Mirrors. Just about worth a look as you are there, but it is far from opulent. Looking through a wired grid is not the best."
this is a very artistic building built by mughals. visit it early in the morning for the best views.
Beautifully skilled craftsmanship and detail. Take a little extra time to really look at the detail. The highlight of the visit to this fort.
We were so lucky to have a great guide. Walking through the Fort stopping at the amazing interior Palace rooms was really enhanced by our guide. Having him point out how they carved the marble and then inlaid with the semi-precious stones was great. The combination of the wonderful workmanship and a detailed history of India during this timeframe really enhanced our visit.
"Located in Agra Fort, it is so called because of the mirrors embedded in the ceiling and walls. This was the royal bath. You can see it from the outside and maybe peep through the opening in the door if you are lucky as the place is out of bounds and has been closed for a long time now. If you can get close, and it is possible as this is India and who you know or how much you can pay someone, will open door. No one knows why it is closed."
Loved visiting this place - across the Yamuna River looking at the Taj Mahal. The story behind it was so sad and the beauty of the place was amazing
Magnificent part of Agra Fort - millions of mirrors. Amaaaazing stuff!!  Another tick on the bucket list!
I am only sorry that we were not able to see this building after dark when it would have been illuminated by candlelight.  It is nevertheless a sight to behold in daytime too and to be able to marvel at the skill of the craftsmen and the imagination of the designer.  Make sure you don’t miss it.
As the title suggest Visiting Sheesh Mahal give you a different outfit and makes the tourist attraction towards it. Traveling such places you may feel the historical touch in you. This historical monument which was built during the Mughals Period has an amazing historical background.
"Sheesh mahal is very captivating. We have seen it in movies but it is really beautiful in reality too. Though it is not in good condition, but it is a thing to wonder how beautiful it would have been in old times. Do click some photographs."
"Breathtaking room filled with thousands of mirrors all shaped and sizes.  It was really stunning.  Wasn't expecting to see something so wonderful in a ""fort""."
Don't miss .. mirrors and glasses makes us feels something superb .. The effort taken for this .. astonishing .. kids can enjoy a lot .. lovely  bit by bit enjoy the spot .. sometimes the entry restricted ..unusual  I do not know there is no uniformity. . Government should concentrate on this ..
