We went a bit before sunset and the garden was simply stunning! Leave enough time to explore all of it!
"It's a big garden facing a beautiful mountain across the sea. The only setback for our visit was that we were just few days earlier before the sakura were fully bloom. However I could envision the beauty of the surroundings. Even without the sakura, it still big and fun to explore. I particularly enjoy climbing up to the mountain top. The air is fresh and you can have a great view of the coastal area. There's no stalls along the way, so it's kind of like jungle trails. Be prepared to bring water along the way. You'll have no regrets!"
Walking around you get a great feeling of ancient life as a royal... the grounds are well marked out. Make sure you go around back up the very old stone stairs..
Was lucky that it was a clear day and and manage to get a clear view of Sakurajima.  Garden is big. Wish I have more time to hike to the top. Would have been better in Spring as there is not much color in the garden. Still plenty to explore.
"I thought this place was absolutely beautiful.  It offers a lovely walk with some pretty plants, great scenery and some lovely water features. I enjoyed wandering around on the sunny lunchtime I visited...it wasn't packed and was really very nice.The view across to Sakura-jima is probably one of the best on offer in Kagoshima. Don't miss it.The entry fee of Y1000 includes a museum in the price, but I didn't have time to visit it. There are a few restaurants, some shops and gift shops on site.If you have mobility issues you will be limited to the lower half of the garden...which would be a shame as some of the nicest parts are a climb up step/uneven steps. I used the cute pass to get here which I purchased from the tourist info desk at JR Kagoshima-chuo. It has plenty of frequent buses to the garden from the station and around Kagoshima."
"The garden showed a nice collection of flowers in november. Compared to the sublime samoerai gardens in Chiran, an hour from Kagoshima, the Sengan-en Garden was less astonishing. A nice garden with some remains  of the first industrialization of Japan."
"Undoubtedly offers a great view of the volcano, but also worth taking the time to walk around the entire garden and the house.  Recommend to allocate more time to enjoy this place. For shopaholics, there's a tax refund counter in Sengan-en, super convenient."
"A very lovely garden and very interesting shops too. Strange, unique flower protectors around the peonies. Parking costs 300 yen."
"Go here and feel the tranqulity of a Japanese garden, and also have a great view across the bay to Sakurajima. Sometimes you may see the tea ceremony done here or hear traditional musicians at play. Nearby are also museums showing the influence from the West when they introduced some technology and engineering. Great area to spend time and relax."
"We visited this as part of a tour from a cruise.. This certainly was a highlight. Such an amazing complex.. Gardens , Temples, ponds etc.. And the view out to the volcano was an unusual feature also.. Saw a submarine out in the water too.Luckily had quite abit of time here to admire everything.."
once you get away from the entrance this garden opens up to it's full beauty and you see why the rulers of the day made it and lived there.  Take the time to walk to the boundaries of the garden and you will be rewarded with some spectacular views
Recommended if you like gardens. There's also a shopping area for food and souvenirs and some restaurants. We also bought the full priced ticket to visit the house as well and it was interesting.
It was such a nice place to visit. Cost 1000yen for 1 person tour of the grounds and museum. So picturesque and calming. Make sure to complete the hike at the top of the route to  see the most magnificent view of the bay and volcano. Took around half hr one way. The museums were also interesting.
"Don’t miss Sengan-en if you are in the area. The gardens are stunning with beautiful views of the sea and volcano. The house has explanations in English and one can easily imagine the lives of the family that lived there. Plan to spend a few hours exploring. There are tasteful cafes, gift shops and a restaurant on site as well."
"Beautiful scenery, stunning gardens that are extremely well kept, quite a bit of history and some shops, with high quality local foods, absolutely out of this world handmade glass craft of such exquisite quality that I have never seen in my life and all kinds of other cool stuff! Go and spend at least 4 hours there... So beautiful..."
"This garden is such a beautiful garden! For nature lovers, I think you need at least 2 hours to really enjoy this garden.  Good place to go for a leisurely stroll! This garden is a good way to see a Japanese-style garden. My husband and I, and our 12-year old son really enjoyed it and wished that we had more time. Very beautiful and scenic! Admission is around 1000Y ($10 USD) each with a child discount available.  We also took the Residence tour (extra 500Y/250Y elementary grade child ($5/$2.50 USD extra to get this tour). This guided tour enables you to see how the Shimadzu lived – you’ll actually see the inside of the house. Note, we had a Japanese guide but fortunately we were with somebody who spoke English.  Even without having an English translator, however, I think it’s worth the extra $5 bucks. There are set times for the tours and each take approximately 20 minutes. In addition, you will be served green tea and a small piece of dessert which has the insignia of the Shimadzu family (short tea ceremony). Note the green tea is a traditional Japanese tea, which is substantially creamier than the green tea you find in the US. It has a stronger taste, too. Note, my 12-year son did not like the dessert. My husband and I, however,  enjoyed the tea and the mini dessert. Glad that we paid the extra $.  If you're here, pay the extra $ for the Residence tour."
"I'm normally a person who prefers city nights rather than daytime visits to serene gardens. So it was a surprise to enjoy the Sengan-en Gardens and grounds. Walking around this historical site was enjoyable and I learned a lot about the Shimadzu family and this era of Japanese history. It's also nice to take in the view and scenery, along with the fresh air."
Excellent gardens and Original home. Do the tour of the house and take some tea. Great view of the water and the island. Walk around at your own pace.Well worth the visit.
"With lovely gardens, an impressive Japanese mansion, an views of Sakurajima volcano in the background this place is a must see. Read the history of the Shimadzu family before you go to get a feeling for what was going on then - or better yet go with someone who can explain the history and all the nuances that go with it - and it will come alive to you as you stroll through it. There are shops that sell the glass, and cedar wood products made during that period. Also, stop at the sweet potato candy and vinegar shop. You can easily spend a day there."
"Loved this garden plus museum with the full use of the natural surrounding elements of water, hills and volcano across the bay.  To do it justice allow around 2 hours minimum.  Both routes of the city view bus calls in here."
"This place was ok.... some real nice garden bits, not amazing, it was expensive though I thought. I got yelled at to use the ticket machine despite there being people to sell tickets to us. Lots of expensive shops. Reading up on the place I appreciated it. But didn’t really impress"
"Perhaps the best garden I saw in all Japan. Take the hike up the mountain to the waterfall viewing platform if you can. It is a joy to walk in the indigenous forrest. The view from the top is also great.There is a great little eatery inside. Also a more formal restaurant, which I didn't try."
"We’ve seen many homes and gardens in Japan and Senganen was one of the most impressive. The house is not just historic it is gorgeous. The staff are helpful (some English spoken) and clearly proud to be working there. The gardens are really remarkable with ponds, small buildings, fountains and great walking areas. It’s March and there are lots of trees and flowers in bloom but it must be gorgeous most of the year. There’s a lot of English signage which is helpful along with young, enthusiastic staff. The shops are interesting with local traditional sweets along with beautiful crafts. We aren’t so fond of cut glass but the production here is a quite remarkable. Expensive and wonderful. We spent 3-4 hours wandering around and having lunch in the cafe - which was also quite good. Keep a watch for someone ordering one of the deserts with tea - the making of the tea is an interesting exhibition."
Lovely place. Amazing seeing 350-year-old trees. Visit the museum right beside it. Don't forget to try the matcha soft ice cream. The best match ice cream for me!
This is a must visit if you're in Kagoshima. The garden is a beautiful traditional Japanese style with Kyushu influences and Kyushu native vegetation. It's like traditional Japan and Hawaii. Let's not forget the amazing view of Sakurajima and the volcanos in the background. Breathtaking views. You can take the several different tourism buses to this location. The buses in Kagoshima are excellent!
"Decided to check this out based on the positive reviews. Boy, was I disappointed! Big piece of land but nothing spectacular. We saw nicer gardens while driving past some residential areas. Don't bother if you've been to much nicer ones like those in Kyoto."
"Having visited 4 superb gardens in Tokyo & 1 in Hrioshima, this garden came as a dissappointment although in fact it is a very good garden. The major aspect is the opportunity to visit the House.To gain entry to the garden a ticket can onlyt be purchased using one of the Automatic Machines. The attendants at the gate were rather brusque which for the Japanese I found very surprising.The site cleverly uses the backdrop of the hills and across the water to Mount Ontake (& its smoking Volcano).The site is basically long & thin. From the gate travelling east the garden stretches about 550m and at its widest (around the house) about 110m. Westwards from the Main Gate there are the musuems. Outside the site and to the western edge is the factory with it's showroom & visit to the glass-blowing.Walking around the garden the parths are of shingle and this has a habit of getting into open sandals (best to wear shoes).When we were there the main pond had been drined for maintenance and obviously could have looked better. Of note (apart from the House) whilst walking around was the Tin Gate, the Original Main Gate, the Jumping Lion Lantern, the Oniwa Shrine and the water-powered Rice Pounder.In the shops the was very beautiful & expensive glassware for saleJust outside the Site (by the car park) was the simple Tsurugane Shrine"
"A really nice garden. Great view of Sakurajima. Make sure you go on a clear, sunny day. Recommend getting the one-day city sightseeing bus and tram pass."
"This garden was very beautiful with lots of Japanese landscape and character.  Went with tour group.  From other's pic it doesn't appears that there's more to see than what we saw.  We had an explanation of the Shimadzu main house and drank tea with a little manju.  There's several gift shops as you exit the property.  Across the street, we went through the museum first.  That museum showed the Shimadzu's family history."
"check our their beautiful website; you will be mesmerized.  This is an extremely well preserved historic site with excellent restaurants, shops and preserved buildings.  One can easily see how the ruling lord of the area could enjoy the daily view of Sakurajima.  It is worth planning a full day there.  Easy access as a tourist via the City view bus (get a daily bus pass)."
"This history filled garden is a must while in Kagoshima!We payed 1600￥/adult for an enterance ticket to the Sengan-en / Isotei-en , Shuseikan and Shimadzu family house tour (Japanese)+ green tea set.My 8 year old had a stamp rally with an easy questionnaire at the end…got a clear fille as a reward.We enjoy  this garden every time we visit the city. Enjoy!"
"Senganen is a charming Japanese garden, filled with Banzai trees and manicured lawns. The garden and the residence  was in possession of the Shimadzu family for over 350 years.  Today it's open to the public, for a small fee (around $10).  Take your time there.  Enjoy the beautiful greenery and the architecture.There is a small Cat Shrine, in the complex, dedicated to, well.. cats.  It's a part of the tour.  It's small so don't miss it.  A gift shop next door sells hand-made bamboo sculptures and ""jewelry"".   Don't miss the Ramen restaurant nearby.  It was my first time trying the real Japanese Ramen and it was delicious.To get there take a City View Bus, ISO line.  It operates every 30 minutes or so, from 9am to 5:30pm. Senganen Garden has its own stop.  To get back to the city take same bus.  It makes a one-way loop around town.  Word of advice - see Senganen in the morning.  Not because it's crowded - it's usually not, but because on the way back you can hop off the ISO bus at Ishibashi Park and visit the bridges there.  But, that's a different review. :)"
Climb the short trail to where the lord of the clan once walked to aid his thinking. Beautiful view of sakurajima and the port at the observatory points.The area around the feudal lord residence has been beautiful landscaped. Impressive and peaceful scenery. Definitely worth a visit if you are a nature and history kinda person.
Beautiful home and garden of the feudal lord of japan.  You feel like that you were back in time.  Don't miss the residence visit though you would need to pay a bit more for the admission.  It is an eye opener for those who are interested in japanese culture.  The garden itself is beautiful and serene.  Do spend more time to walk and explore the upper part of the garden though there are some slopes and stairs.
Huge garden with the residence houses facing the volcano in Sakurajima. Enjoyed the walk round the gardens n the great view of the volcano. There are also some shops selling souvenirs as well as some local snacks.
