"Pay a visit to this natural beauty - the geysir that splashes hot water every 4 to 8 minutes. The water is literraly boilling. Although it was -12 C,there was no ice or snow in the little area near the geysir."
"Iceland is beautiful, everywhere. A unique experience. This is one of its places you cannot miss, the only place in Europe with these geysers. If you want to see something similar, you need to go to America... Take your time to walk around and enjoy the spectacular nature. The weather is very often cloudy and rainy, except some exceptions with lovely weather. Be ready with good clothing , be patient and make a full immersion in this environment, you will be satisfied. Iceland offers people a chance to see the earth the way it was."
"The Strokur geyser blows it's top every 6-7 minutes but we were lucky to see two eruptions of the same size one after the other. I'm not sure why this happened but it takes everyone by surprise.Waiting for Strokur to blow you can see the water level bulge upwards into a large blue bubble a split second before it releases it's steam. Surrounding the geyser are a couple of smaller pits where the water is on constant boil showing just how much heat there is in the ground, yet, ironically, there is snow and ice everywhere."
"Waiting for the geyser is exciting and when it goes off it is a genuinely wow! It is well worth the drive up from Reykjavik and a great combination to see with Gulfloss nearby too. The hot springs are well populated but the site is well managed, so it doesn't feel crowded. There is a decent shop with loos at the site, food there is expensive but no more than the rest of Iceland."
"A must see site which is worth the wait, each time. See if you can see the dome of water just before the spout. Deliciously eggy smell."
