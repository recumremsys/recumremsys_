"Nestled away in Yokohama this little garden is a gem. The garden is beautiful and well kept, very aesthetically pleasing. It also has little historic temples and old houses which are interesting in themselves. There is one multi-storey house you can walk around, complete with a fire in the open range kitchen, which is an interesting view into life into old Japan.The tea ceremony was quite fun, with very friendly ladies explaining to us how we should do it and not being too distraught as we got it all wrong!If doing a day trip to Yokohama it makes a good first stop. To get there we got the Tokyu line (catch it from Shibuya) and if you get the right train you can stay on it as it turns into Minatomirai line, then get off at the last stop, Motomachi-Chukagai. If you exit there (I want to say exit no.2 but don't quote me on that) you can cross the road to the bus stop - you can either hop on the bus no.8 which I understand stops nearby the garden (although we did not do this), or if you time it right there was an hourly bus that services the gardens and goes straight there. When heading back take the bus that goes every hour and get off near China town, just in time for lunch - perfect!"
"Had a really nice walk around here, lots of plants and different buildings, large lake area with little bridges dotted around as well. Took us nearly two hours and there were a couple of areas where it was quite steep if you wanted to go to the viewing platform or pagoda, but very enjoyable."
The garden is off the beaten path.  Take a bus from Yokohama as it is too far to walk.  The garden has several structures from the Edo period laid-out in a very pleasant design.  It reminded me of Kyoto gardens in many ways.  From the bus stop it is a reasonable walk through a residential area.  There are small restaurants in the garden park.  We visited at the tail-end of cherry blossom season.
"A must in Yokohama, an area more then a garden. Do not expect meditative buddist simplicity this is more history of a person who saved some pieces of 1700-1800 Japan style. Nice walk, can be hot and sweaty so take your time. Have water with you."
"Getting there is a bit of a pain by public transport, simple enough, just slightly painful.Train, then bus, then walk.The walk makes up for the previous two. As I casually strolled to the gardens I had time to appreciate suburban Japan, with the streets in perfect conditions and everyone seeming to try and outdo each other with backyard semi-bonsai trees. Very relaxed when I got there.Not very expensive, about 1000 Yen, I think (or less). And free to wander as much as I chose once inside the gate.Come at the right time (late March/early April, I was told) and the plum blossoms are spectacular. Confirm this because they truly are captivating.All the buildings and grounds are kept immaculate. I saw a couple of others taking photos there and most everyone was considerate of each other, standing out of the way and so on. A rare treat for sure.Everywhere I went I was held in thrall by the magic of the place, walking around in this grandiose feeling almost palatial garden compound.A guide I read suggested an hour and a half here as maximum time, I would suggest another hour on that if you truly want to relax and wander through slowly, appreciate the feeling and splendour that is here.I left feeling zen and completely at ease. Seeing all the cats wandering around didn't hurt either. All very relaxed and comfortable with strangers everywhere.Enjoy the views, breathe the air, have a cup of tea at the teahouse."
"Very peaceful.  Loved watching kids and adults fishing for crayfish. Lots of water and bridges, very tranquil.  We caught a taxi from Yokohama central, cost 23000 Â¥.  There were 3 of us, so this worked out well.  You can take bus or train, good directions on website, but taxi was quicker for us with limited time and on a rainy day.  Staff at front entrance very helpful."
Big area and takes a while to walk around. There are some interesting old buildings within the gardens. Walked around for about 3 hours. Tranquil area away from the hustle and bustle.
"A very special place! Gorgeous and specious traditional gardens, full of history ! Walk around, have some tea with mochi, visit farmer's house and all the other structures.. Its not paved there, gravel, so flats for ladies are recommended. We saw turtles, birds, carps..A very zen place, you will see wedding ceremonies there , entrance fee about $5. We took a taxi from our hotel , less than $18 from Yamashita Park area, 10 min rude or, so depending on traffic. Must see in Yokohama."
"A must see in Yokohama for nature aficionados!  The garden is as relaxing as can be with many structures detailing some of Japan's finest architects.  The area can be reached by bus or taxi and an English brochure is available.  The garden presents also a variety of specimens to tickle your ""nature"" side.  Don't rush through the exhibits, take time to enjoy the place, the history, and the view."
Was in Yokohama for business and had a day off.  Took the bus from a stop near my hotel.  I pointed on a map to where I wanted to get off and the drive let me know the stop.  The gardens are a self guided tour for the most part with volunteer docents in one of the historic buildings.  I attend a tea ceremony which was certainly worth seeing.  The gardens have many historic building that give you a sense of Japanese history.
Get the bus from Yokohama station to this lovely garden to see some Japanese style buildings from all over Japan. I found a free guide who spent a couple of hours with me walking round the park.
"lovely grounds with landscaped hills and ponds. free wifi and clear signage.  love the buildings (villa, shrines) dotted around the area.  easy walk from the bus stop too.  would be even lovelier in spring or deep autumn.  worth the fare, and clean toilets that are free."
"Visiting the Yokohama City area and want a bit of tranquility and tradition, then you should visit the Sankeien Gardens. Recently, visitors wanted to see Japanese Gardens,and were directed to see Ebisu Gardens in Tokyo. Much to their disappointment, these are not gardens at all in the traditional sense but a huge shopping mall-like venue. So I took them to Sankeien, and they were amazed by the immediate transformation from modern city life, to the traditional, tranquil garden sights along with the beauty of the architecture that is trademark Sankeien. There are ponds strategically placed and old wooden bridges with lotus blossoms peaking thru, while the carp in the ponds await your morsels of bread. . The bread is to be purchased at the nearby vendor and you can enjoy the pleasure of feeding the carp around the many ponds. The experience can be satisfying for children and adults alike. The architecture and the landscaping are simply fantastic, and you will marvel at nearly every step you take, and will want to photograph it to keep as one of your  treasured memories of your visit. You can also take a rest while walking the gardens, as there are many benches provided and you can buy some light foods as well. There is also the opportunity to brown-bag or 'bento' your lunch as well. There are places to sit and have a nice lunch. Depending to the time of year, it can be a quiet, private time, or it can be a crowded and some of the tranquility is lost. I've visited twice last year, and both were during the cold weather season, so not to crowded and very peaceful. Another really great thing about it, is that you can call ahead and get the schedule for the tea ceremonies that are held inside the small museum area. The ladies are wear the traditional Japanese kimono and will demonstrate how tea is prepared. After preparing the tea, they serve you and explain how the tea should the receiver should drink the tea. It's a great experience for everyone. You can take great photos with the ladies sitting dressed in kimono in front of the tea making area (not sure what it's called). The only thing that can be annoying sometimes is if it's crowded and then the experience is not as pleasant, but still a winner. You can always 'escape' the heavily populated areas as the gardens are so vast, that if you keep walking around, you can find a tranquil place and reflect. There is an entrance fee, and a bit on the pricey side, but there is a discount for the over seventy persons, with proper identification. Depending on the season, there are different events being held at any given time, for example, fire fly night sessions, when specific flowers are in bloom, they sometimes have night events. So best to call ahead or check the net about what's going on. Enjoy!"
Wonderful day spent here. We went on a Saturday during cherry blossom season and it was very busy. Loved the street food stools at the entrance. Even as a vegetarian I managed to get BBQ soya sweetcorn and a gold leaved ice cream. Both delishous. Defiantly worth a trip. Xx
"I can see green everywhere. Mediation. Relaxing. :)You can enjoy the lake full of lotuses, the pagoda, the houses combined of tradition and modern. And there are 2 super cute cats there :)One of my best traditional place in Yokohama"
"It's a sprawling garden with peaceful, tranquil atmosphere. It has several historic buildings, tea houses and pagoda. There are different exhibitions throughout the year. The entrance fee of JPY500/adult is worth it. Get a map at the entrance, and also a unique stamp with the garden's name on it. We also tried a cup of hot matcha tea at the tea house. It's interesting to learn about the proper way of drinking tea, which is explained in detail in the pamphlet provided."
More than just a lovely garden. Has architectural examples of traditional homes and a tea ceremony. Easy to access with public transportation
"Going here is the best experience I had from my recent trip to Japan. The garden itself is serene with a lot of history in it. I appreciate very much that when you enter the garden, there are volunteer tour guides who are happy to walk you around the garden, telling the story of each location along the way.But the highlight for me is the Japanese tea ceremony in the memorial hall. For 500 yen, we were able to experience a tea ceremony with macha and sweets, and as a bonus they also thought us how to make traditional tea! It's the best 500 yen we've ever spent. I believe they only conduct those every 18th to 23rd of each month.I'll definitely go back here next time."
I first visited the gardens in 1987 and it's still as good now as it was then. Getting there from Yokohama Station west exit is a bit of a pain. The bus gets really busy.
Just returned from Tokyo and had the pleasure to visit Sankeien Gardens. We werejust about 2 weeks away from momiji (fall colors) and any time between now and mid December should be amazing. It takes easily 4 to 5 hours and if you like to take picturesand the colors are changing leave more time. Take a cab from the station and enjoy your day. This is the estate of a silk merchant and was started in 1887. This is on of my favorite places in the Tokyo area in 15 trips.
The garden is extremely beautiful in itself but we were lucky to encounter the free English guided tour (there was an announcement about the tour or ask the staff at the main entrance about the free guided tour.)  The tour guide was very informative and provided us with insight why the garden was constructed and the Zen- Shinto infused landscape. He even imitated the process of the famous tea ceremony at the actual building where the owner of the compound did the ceremony 100 years ago. A free guided tour is well worth it. Go for it when thereâs chance!!!
Great family photo opportunity. Live ther house structure in the far back. Take off your shoes and explore!
Visited these gardens on  a beautiful sunny afternoon. Flowers were blooming and the architecture of the home on the premises took you to a different era.
Take a step back in time...see the houses of the Samurai in a beautiful Park setting...one of the Highlites of a visit to Yokohama and vicinity!  Do not miss!   Papadave Toronto
"Enjoyed our stroll around the gardens, bus trip was fine, good adventure! Lots of the huts/pagoda were closed off, not sure if due to recent stormy weather. Was hoping for some Autumnal colour but a bit too early for that. Awesome Japanese lunch by the lake, reasonable prices. Worth a visit if you like nature and have a morning or afternoon to spare whilst staying in Yokohama."
"Our visit on March 27, 2015 was a bit early for full bloom but we did see a number of trees filled with pink cherry blossoms. We were a group of 9 ladies. I like the blissful ambience of the whole park and most especially our tea ceremony. It was free. We entered the tea room in the reception building and sat down on the vacant seats. We were offered tea  with 2 sugary little cakes. An explanation was given while the tea was being prepared. The tea was a strong green concoction. I haven't tasted it before in my life. It was a short yet fulfilling experience.  Completing the park tour is a real nature trek.  In my next chance to go to Yokohama, I might just do it again."
"This park is simply amazing.  Filled with Sakura (Cherry Blossoms) and adoring locals capturing this special time of year.   It's peaceful, calm and a relaxing out-of-the-tourist trail way to enjoy beautiful Japanese surrounds.  Definitely worth a visit"
"Finally I saw true beauty of Yokohama. Beautiful place with unique atmosphere. Many things were moved from Kyoto so you can really see the true beauty of Japanese architecture here. I visited Sankeien Garden in December but trees were still full of colours. Amazing to see this beauty in red/green/golden colours.. What a feeling. It was Saturday afternoon and I was lucky I saw a wedding in traditional Japanese clothes. Take your time, walk slowly and inhale that smell of fresh falling leaves."
"I'm in Japan, from California, and my son wants to take me around Yokohama to see the sights.  We went to the gardens one morning.  It was interesting to see the different buildings that had been moved to the gardens.  We took a nice long walk around the lake, which is the center point.  Got a guide, printed in English, which helped, along with signs, explain what everything was.  For me, the highlight was a docent, who took us through a farm house, built during the Edo Era, moved to the park in 1960.  He explained everything, in Japanese, to my son, who relaid it to me.  The docent seemed very pleased to show off his building, probably taking us into areas that were off limits to most.  I hope I came away with a little more understanding of the culture and life in early 19th century, agricultural Japan."
Relaxing and a beautiful area to visit.   When I visited there was also a tea ceremony.   In the garden you would not know you were this close to a busy city.  The old buildings provides a glimpse of living in old Japan.  I would recommend going.
"Sankeien was originally the home and very spacious garden of a wealthy silk merchant. He bought a number of beautiful old buildings and had them brought to Yokohama, placed in the gardens and restored. There are temple buildings  (including a pagoda), tea houses, a large farmhouse, a bridge, a lake, etc.I have been to Sankeien many times over the years and never get tired of it. I recommend visiting on a weekday as early in the morning as possible, when there are fewer people, or later in the afternoon. It tends to get crowded on weekends. You can get there by bus or taxi from Negishi Station, on the JR Keihin Tohoku Negishi Line, which runs through Yokohama Station. Make sure you have a good look around the Inner Garden, which contains the best buildings, some of which are hidden amongst the trees. The best time of year? Any season other than winter, when most of the trees have lost their leaves, the grass is brown and the garden is generally drab, unless you are lucky enough to visit after a rare fall of snow."
"Make sure you walk along these gardens and enjoy the peace and silence. You will occasionally meet bride and groom photographed in this environement. You can even enjoy a tea ceremony nearby,."
"On our recent trip to Japan, we grabbed the opportunity to visit the Sankeisn Gardens. Sadly, as the Blossoms had arrived early, we can only imagine how beautiful this area would have been during the very short Season. We did manage to find one lovely tree in its last days so had to content ourselves with that. The Gardens are beautifully laid out and like most tourist destinations in Japan, seniors do get a discount. Typical of the friendliness of the Japanese, we were greeted by a volunteer guide with quite good English who was only too happy to take us on a guided tour of the area, pointing out plants, etc and showing us through the amazing Samuri building which is some 700 years old. So well constructed!We reached the Gardens by bus and there is a short walk to the entrance but well worth it and definitely the spot for camera enthusiasts. Do visit if you get the chance!"
"A large traditional garden with ponds, waterfalls and blossoming trees, and historical residential and tea houses. A good alternative to Kamakura if you are on a tight schedule.  Half an hour from the Chinatown area by bus. Make sure to check the timetable as frequency drops during daytime. There are English speaking volunteer guides.éåã¾ã§è¡ãæéã®ç¡ãæã«ãå§ããã¾ããä¸­è¯è¡ãããã¹ã§30åã§ãããæ¥ä¸­ã¯æ¬æ°ãå°ãªãã®ã§äºããç¢ºèªãããæ¹ãè¯ãããç¥ãã¾ããã"
"We were a little late for the cherry blossoms but enjoyed it just the same.  Spent a couple of hours here walking along the paths, reading the informative boards that explained the origins of the buildings.  Lake was nice - complete with turtles.  The local guide at entrance will point you to the correct local bus which is a short walk away."
