Cleanest beach in Goa visited so far. The beach has a great view of Taj Fort Agauda and the most cleanest beach ever visited by me. Beach known for shacks and amazing food. Visited with family in the month of September.
recommend the tourist in Goa to visit Sinquerim Beach. the most scenic calm n less crowded beach of north goa. Sinquerim beach is quieter than Candolim and a lot quieter than Calangute. This beach is perfect
One of the best beaches in north goa. Maintained well and not much crowded. The view is also very good next to fort aguada implementation from taj management. Overall a nice spot to hangout in the evenings or early mornings.
The lower Aguada fort is on of this beach. Great view with the Sea all around. Must visit in Goa. Suggested time twenty to thirty minutes.
One of the good beaches to visit in Goa . Overlooking Green water and yellow whitish sand . Not very populated and hence an ideal place . Have fort like structures near shoreline .
"This is one of the best beaches to visit while in North Goa. It is quite clean, less crowded, and offers good water sport activities. Including jet ski, para sailing, banana boat, boating trip for dolphin watching, etc. Nice place to visit for family."
"Sinquerim beach is very beautiful, view's visible upto north beaches from sinquerim fort and beach. Swaying palm's, white sands, clear view's all'are charming and soothing."
This beach is at opposite side of the Aguada fort. Certain part is occupied by TAJ hotels. Check my pics
"One of the best beache with all sports activities here. Topping is fort view, which makes this awesome."
A beautiful beach in north goa where you have lot of water sport activities. Watching the sunset here is too beautiful.This is one of the famous beach of north goa. It is famous for its amazing view and the activities.
"I really love visiting Sinquerim Beach. Situated right next to Aguada Fort, this beach is known not only because its beautiful, but also because of its peace and calmness. It is not one of the 'IT' beaches to visit in Goa just so that you score brownie points for showing a check-in but if you really want to enjoy a relaxed and peaceful time looking at the sunset, sitting by the shore and just observing the surroundings. Its proximity to Candolim beach is almost like walking for 10 - 20 odd minutes on the shore and you are right in midst of all the action that Goan beaches are otherwise known for! Must visit for all the nature, sunset lovers who want some time away to sit back and relax."
"Taj Vivanta!! Makes this beach More attractive...This beach is quite clean as well as way to beach journey is enjoyable!!! To be very honest this beach's main attraction is Taj Vivanta Hotel!!! You have to go through the entire market area and Beach has a one passage to reach through Taj Vivanta!!! So Journey towards Sinquerim is nice rather than a beach, hence average ratings to the beach"
Very accessible from Taj properties. Nice place to relax. Has a decent shack as well. It is open all through the year. Can go on nice long walk. Beach has steep slope. So not very ideal to go in the water.
Found this beach to be extremely crowded . Beaches are much better further south. However many good restos and bars on this beach.
This beach is nice quite and away from crowd.. very scenic. Went in rains so the view was extremely beautiful.
It is one of the best beach to visit there you will find fort as well as beach surrounded by coconut trees. You can also enjoy slow tide hitting the fort walls. You will see the old and strong architecutre and its beauty. You can also enjoy the beach there. Beaches are very clean. Try to go there early ae the route to the beach is narrow and only two vehicle can pass at once. If you want to enjoy the beach go in month of sept as crowd will not be there but at the same time you will not find any vendor so try to go there with your beach cloths.
"A very clean beach and safe for families.  A large portion of this beach, starting from Taj Fort Aguada, is owned by Taj.  Hence, the general upkeep of the beach is good.  Special mention of the Lifeguard team that keeps monitoring the beach during duty hours (before sundown).   Water sports available.  There are a lot of beautiful beach shacks (i.e. bar & restaurants) that also have deck chairs laid outdoors for sunbathing/general lounging.  However, you need to order something from the shack or pay a fee to use these chairs.  Went for my morning runs barefooted on the beach, much recommended!"
"Visited this beach at candolim in first wk.of Nov.Candolim is nearly 17 kms from Panjim nd nearly 45 kms from Airport at Debolim. it is a beautiful beach. Very clean. Not crowded. peaceful area. Good number of foreign tourists visit this beach.shaks at this beach are well maintained . behavior of shaks walas better then calangute beach.We enjoyed sea nd sun at this beach sitting in shaks for long hours.khana penna in these shakes quite good at reasonable cost. Water sports like jet scooter, sailing etc available at this beach."
"Been there while returning from Agoda Fort. Expectation was low because the beach near the densely populated area are not recommended. But to our surprise this beach was far superior than many famous beaches of that area in terms of beauty, cleanliness & location as well.Lot of option for water sports at affordable prices."
One of the good beach can find in Goa. Been spent good amount of time and it was fun being here. Enjoyed the time off.
"Located just around 13 km from the capital city of Panaji, Sinquerim is considered the first tourist beach in North Goa. The beautiful beach lies south of other famous North Goan beaches like Candolim, Calangute and Baga. You can spend hours hear lying on the soft sand, swimming in the ocean water or going windsurfing, scuba diving, fishing, water skiing and parasailing. If you are visiting Goa for the first time, Sinquerim Beach is a good place to head to for a good time."
"Located beside Taj Fort Aguada, the Sinquerim beach has a couple of shacks, water sports and a quiet beach front. It's perfect for early morning run or walk because you won't see any bottles or garbage strewn around"
"Sinquerim is a nice small beach, which generally is not very crowded. Does not have too many shacks... has just 2 of them. But it is a beautiful and calm place."
"This is a wonderful place for discovering ""Educated looking"" person scribbling on Sinquerim fort walls. Have a look at this pic below.Sinquerim fort has an amazing Aura.. Try to visit it before sunrise!!.. The gush of waves can easily make one nostalgic.."
"A lovely beach which we only found at the end of our 2 week holiday. We visited Calungute & Candolim which were so busy & overcrowded. We visited beginning of October, so slightly out of season for the main tourists & beach huts were only just being set up. Saying that this beautiful, calm, quiet beach was such a contrast to the others. If you like it mad & overcrowded then go for the others but for tranquility & peace stick to Singuerim Beach, you won't be disappointed. It's gorgeous!"
We visited this beach just after the cyclone hit Goa and found only a few shack left on the beach. The beach itself is lovely and long and you can get lost in it. Leading up to the beach was quite busy with little stalls selling food/drinks and lots of motorbikes/scooters. The first shack was very busy with mainly Russian visitors but the next couple were English and other countries. There were a few beach sellers but nothing to worry about. It certainly didn't spoil my visit and we returned a few days later to spend a lazy day on the beach.
"Arrive at this beach via the road alongside Taj Fort Aguada Resort & Spa and take a flight of stairs to this calm beach where you can enjoy the beach and the gentle waves. I am sure there may be times when the waves become enormous. However, the day I visited I was able to enjoy the waves along with my five year old daughter who didn't want to leave the beach and enjoy some more. The beach is clean and the lifeguards are attentive. I nice place to hangout especially in the evenings (I visited in the afternoon which was a bad time but we enjoyed nevertheless)."
This is a must visit beach and the small view point (the fort) if you happen to visit the Aguada fort area. Don't miss it if you go to Aguada fort. The beach is really clean white sand beach compared to other north Goa beaches.  The small view point is built in such a way the you happen to walk inside the sea area a few meters. So from there you get to see the sea waves moving away from you!! The view is worth seeing as we are always used to see the waves moving towards us from the shore :)The road leading to this beach is narrow and you need to careful if you drive on your own.
Want to spend some good time without crowd at North Goa then you should definitely spend it on this beach. This is after the candolim beach and a decent one. Taj has it's property here so they have tried to keep it clean.
"Find few good viewpoints for photography here, rest is ok only. Don't expect good sitting place and food here."
"We stayed at the Taj hotel located next to this beach. You can walk for miles and there are loads of beach shacks to stop off at.There were quite a few dogs and cows on the beach. Although they did not bother us.The beach is not impeccibly clean but certainly not a dirty beach. People leave their litter and expect others to clean up. We did see staff walking up and down collecting rubbish.We were there early November. The sea was warm and the shacks were all open for busy. I believe early November is the start of the season. I was unlucky to be stung by a jelly fish, but there were loads of people in the water who weren't.Plenty of water sports to keep you entertained. Located by thd Taj hotel, and fort wall.Overall a good beach and would return."
"From Calamari to the Taj, what a beautiful beach, especially after that eyesore of a ship has been removed.The beach cleaners are wonderful & they really make a difference but there is so much dog pooh around, especially half way down, so be very careful. Don't walk barefoot- lots of broken glass too.I do wish someone would get rid of these flea bitten dogs."
"One of the beaches that should definitely be on Your goa bucketlist. Top attractions for this beach:-> Perfect sunset spot (better than thalasa). The sea becomes glimpse of dark grey and green .. A perfect sight to behold at sunset.-> Affordable water sports (specially parasailing where you don't have to pay extra for dipping your feet in sea unlike water sports in baga and calangute beach). We did Parasailing, jet ski and bumping for Rs 1000 only per person.-> The beach is overlooked by Taj vivanta and the view is breath taking.-> There is a perfect food shack where the food is perfect and you can enjoy the sunset. (we incurred only Rs 900 for total of 5 people). Try mushroom red pasta for sure over there.-> Fort Aguada is close to this beach (approx 10 mins) on scooty. So You can have our whole day spent at these locations."
pretty clean beach. good crowd. lots of water sports and activities. went for para sailing and it was pretty good. lots of restaurants and shacks along the beach offer a great sea view.
"Accessible and a good walk from the hotel. Safe and secured. Be mindful of the tide, monsoons are rough, swim is not advisable."
