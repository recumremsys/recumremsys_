The way they explain gives a complete idea about how our Navy lives in. Salute to INA and  sailors. Jai Hind.
Must see when in Vishkapatanam. Salute to Indian Navy. Cannot think of living in such constrained space even for a day. Very tough job.
"Review is just not about the submarine or the organized museum but understated life of countrys National Heroes who are willing to keep international shores safe at the peril of their lives. Life inside there is guess no less to a jail. Living in space crunching environment with limited access to food, sleep, limited supply of oxygen, having no idea when you get hit by technology driven enemy.  Salute by heart to all those unsung heroes!!"
Wonderful experience of visiting a naval submarine. Situated on R K beach. Must see in Vizag. People with technical background will enjoy more.
"Breathtaking experience to witness the insight of the real submarines. INS Kursura, bought from Russia, participated in India-Pakistan war and India won. There is guide alongside who imparts the such key insights about the submarine. One gets to see a real torpedo. Tickets cost Rs 40 per person. Additional 50 is changer in case in wants pictures inside. If you are patriotic you will just love it. Go for it :)"
"Went to see this museum during an afternoon, One gets a real insights of a submarine and life of a sailor. could have been made more interesting by adding few stories or a better presentation. The whole trip does not take more than 15 mins."
Did you see a ghazi movie? then you will be wondered seeing this submarine (Kursura). You will be awed with the different compartments in the Submarine and understand how difficult to built this. So simply visit this and feel it. It's a history!!!
Visited there 2 days ago. This INS KURSURA submarine had and vital role during her service with INDIAN Navy.Visiting ticket fee is 40 rs.Photography is not allowed inside submarine. It just take 15 minutes to see from inside.Engineering Students must visit this monument.
"The site of a submarine on a shore is just amazing and that too when its one of those machines that took part in an actual war and survived to tell the tale, this submarine was part of the Indo-Pak war of 1971 and now is standing at the RK beach in Vizag for all of us to see and check out how lives of the brave men living inside would have been at sea. The tour is given by few of such men that once served in the same submarine during its service time at sea. Getting inside one can trully see what all kind of sacrifices our faujis do so that we can be safe, sleeping in conditions that would make most of us tremble and hide.A must visit for any one and everyone for sure."
"Great feeling inside the submarine..real submarine where things work, machines, dining place, sleeping place for crews everything shown.. Gives u the patriotic feeling as this particular submarine participated in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, where she played a key role.."
"Don’t forget to visit these caves. Its an ultimate place, the caves are huge from inside, u will be surprised the Train passes over the caves."
"Don't miss if you are in Vizag, they have very guide who explain about this submarine. Overall good experience."
was insightful to look at last generation submarine. will be very informative if we read the information about the submarine and then visit. But still good heads-up about the submarine by the people in charge
If you have watched the movie ghazi attack you will appreciate this place much more.. Its amazing what our defence and submarine does for nation .. Salute to them...
"First time entry into a real submarine, very hard to stay there for a few minutes. Salute to our soldiers when they stay there for days at length."
"This old Sub marine converted into a  museum is one and only of its kind South East Asia. A visit to Vizag would be incomplete without visiting it. Located on the Beach road, its timings are 2-9 pm. (Monday closed)."
"Hey there, INS Kursura being the Asia's first submarine museum is worth the visit. I had visited it in January 2020 along with a friend, and was truly inspired and astonished. This magnificent structure, and its glorious history would definitely ignite a patriotic spark in you. The various  stories , history, structure details and many such facts are narrated to you by the guide ( retired naval personnel) in languages like Hindi , Telugu and English. But listening to the glorious past in the local language is always exciting. Do give a time slot of 40-45 minutes minimum , to witness the the huge engines, the mechanisms and how 77 men shared 2 washrooms, 2 toilets for a month underwaters in such narrow spaces. The description of the interiors is worth describing, but I would like to let you, the traveller explore the next level satisfaction and with excitement.FEES:Rs 40/person - adultRs 20/person- children (below 12 years)charges for camera being separate.TIMINGS:Day	        TimingMonday	Closed / HolidayTuesday	2:00 pm – 8:30 pmWedesday	2:00 pm – 8:30 pmThursday	2:00 pm – 8:30 pmFriday	        2:00 pm – 8:30 pmSaturday	2:00 pm – 8:30 pmSunday	10:00 am – 12:30 pm                         2:00 pm –8:30 pm"
Was visiting Vizag after over 20 years. Was pleasantly surprised to see the Submarine located along the beach walkway. It it worth a visit. this did service the country in the 1971 war so has history. Do visit if you are in Vizag. Costs Rs. 40 /adult + Rs. 50 if you want to click pictures even with your cell phones.
"Must visit. One of a kind in India. Very less entry charges, next to the beach on R. K. Beach so there is no reason to miss it. Very informative and educational. Has air conditioning as well which is a surprise."
"You will get a glimpse of the hardships our sailors face while they are stationed in the submarine. The museum has direct entrance into submarine unlike the actual stair one which is used when it is in sea just so that it is comfortable for visitors to look around. There is a guide to explain about the submarine inside out to the tour groups. You can see where the torpedoes are placed, how the submarine is guided in the sea and also the rooms used by the crew. The guide also gives the tour in English, Telugu and Hindi so ask the ticket checker before entering the submarine. Do visit and get first hand experience of a submarine. This should be on your must visit list when you are in Vizag even for a day. Try to go at day time so that you can see even outside of the submarine closely. They use fans and AC inside the submarine so you won't feel uncomfortable even on a hot day."
"Here is a chance for all to have a look as to how the defenders of our nation do it.Cramped living conditions, barely enough place to move around but they do this all the time. Go and see it for yourself. Its worth it. In fact more than worth it."
"We dont get to see these types of vessels in everyday. Seeing the inside will give a glimpse of how difficult the life of navy people working on submarines. Eventhough this is an old one, but the level of complexity is good to understand."
An actual submarine converted into a museum after it was de commissioned. Liked the way the staffs at the museum who explained how the submarine lived it’s days and a must visit place as there are not many sub’s converted into a museum.
"Don't miss the heritage and I feel I had not done it.  No words to say about INS KURUSURA MUSEUM. I LOVE IT..... once if you see you will feel in such away,  I missed to serve Indian Navy⚓"
"Don't forget to take ticket for camera. Ticket needed even for phone cameras.After watching Gazi attack movie, I was curious to see a Submarine closely. It was really fascinating to watch it from inside.a very small kitchen, very small dining, very small capitan's room (with a small book shelf), very small bunk beds for crew and big torpedoes in front and back. Life of people inside must be tough. Salute to them.From front to back whole submarine was full of many many many equipments."
cannot miss it while in Vizag. went there twice. well maintained and well explained. could understand the tough conditions that the sailors had to face.
"Located right at the beach, amidst market, this unique museum attracts huge amount of tourists towards itself. One takes the tour of the submarine and looks at fancy articles in it."
"The museum is established at the beach of Rama Krishna, Vizag. INS Kurusura was a submarine constructed by Russians in the year 1969. It reached Visakhapatnam in 1970 via the Baltic Sea and since then served the Indian Navy and served for 31yrs. It played a vital role in 1971 war against Pakistan. Decommissioned and turned into a museum. One can easily familiarize with all aspects of submarine life/machineries including weaponry.Its length is 91.3 meters and breadth is 8 meters. The INS Kurusura submarine played a vital role in a number of wars including the 1971 Indo-Pak war.The visiting time is between 2PM to 9PM daily which is pre-extended on Sunday from 12Noon. Entry fees for all and photography is chargeable."
"For all those of us who want to experience how the people survive in a constricted environment several feet below the sea, its a perfect place. Situated on the way to most of the tourist attractions in vizag, it is a nice place to visit. It will take 20 minutes of your time to go through the guided tour of the intricacies of life on a Submarine. The guide will tell you about how the marines lived, where the controls usually are and the history of the Submarine. At the end of the tour, you would have had the unique experience of boarding a real submarine, though a decommissioned one."
"An experience of a different kind - visit to INS Kurusura submarine musuem, located at RK beach, Vizag. A must for school going children and young adults to get a feel of those heroes who guard our waters, cooped up inside the confines of the submarine.Commentaries in Telugu and Hindi/English by the navy men, who are always willing to answer your queries. Entrance through tickets (Rs 40 per adult), which is well organised. Located strategically on the RK beach, do not miss this important landmark of Vizag."
"Most usually we never get to visit a submarine, that too one with a very interesting history. This Submarine would get us to feel the life of our navy men inside these submarines and how they would hit the enemies. Btw, this is the submarine that was actually mentioned in the movie The Ghazi Attack.If you visit this, there is also a Fighter Plain museum opposite to this. Don't miss that one too."
I have visited this place i guess almost 5 times till now. But every time i visit it again it leaves me wid a new discovery inside that gigantic submarine. Last visit of mine was wid my parents n my brother n his wife. This was their first visit to something of this sort n they were really awestruck by what they say. The guides who are inside the submarine are really knowledgeable n will give u good facts about the history of it. It has a lot of intricate details which u wont be able to cover in one visit. But it will surely give u a feel about the life of a seaman who takes the voyage wid similar submarines thousands of feet below the surface of the sea and about their rat-hole kind of life. Make sure to purchase the ticket for photography as it is mandatory if u wanna click pictures. I always prefer the evening timings to visit as once u come outside u can enjoy a little bit in the small garden which faces the ocean n enjoy the sea breeze.
Only one of its kind this side of the world. Gives a very good perspective of life on a submarine.Kudos to the Indian Navy and VUDA for the Submarine Museum. Recommend to be part of ones itenary  on their visit to Visakhapatnam.
"A visit to Vishakhapatnam city is incomplete without visiting the INS Kursura Submarine Museum. A must visit place at Vishakhapatnam indeed. Commissioned in 1969, the Kursura Submarine was decommissioned in 2001 after which the submarine was towed to the current location of the museum near the famous RK Beach. This is perhaps one of the few submarine museums of the world, which has retained its originality. After conversion into a museum, it was opened to public in 2002. The submarine has 7 compartments inside including well maintained cabins, kitchen etc used by the crews during operational times. Though signage was available in each compartment, there was no Guide available at the time of my visit to provide clarifications. The museum is very well maintained and walking inside the museum was a lifetime enlightening experience for me."
"Visiting the INS Kursura is no less than an adventurous thrill. Located on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, at Ramakrishna Beach Vizag, this place is definitely a very perfect place for marine lovers as well as future naval personnells. The curator here is an awesome navy retired person, who will explain you the different components of the submarine as well as will make you aware of the various terms and weapons used by the navy like the torpedo, etc.Officially known as S20, this submarine was converted into a museum by the Andhra government. This place is definitely worth giving a visit if you are on a tour to Visakhapatnam."
