"A peaceful place in this busy environment in Bangalore. Say everyone hare Rama hare Rama, Rama Rama hare hare."
"What a remarkable Har Krishna Temple in Bangalore, India! On our drive to this great temple there were 7 cows who owned the road by crossing to the other side on their own sweet time! Cows are revered as sacred animals in this country and as I was patiently waiting, I thought how cool for these sacred cows to pass by as I'm on my way to the temple! When we arrived, we had to remove socks and shoes before entering. It does cost a small amount of money to enter, so my guide lead me all the way! I needed to wash my face, hands and feet! Then we began taking the steps up to the entrance. I counted each one. At different times we went into small areas to pray, as I watched and said my own prayers, I watched, then asked why he did certain movements such as hands, laying on the ground, placing his forehead on the wall, etc. My guide explained everything to me. I was curious about everything, but never minded me asking. We went up more steps, then more prayers. Then pictures of the outside of this beautiful building made if concrete, marble and gold! After the 120 step, we entered an amazingly large room with men and women in prayer giving respect. No pictures were allowed to be taken inside. So I refrained out of due respect. I saw Beautiful paintings, art in gold, and so many statues. We followed a line of people and I gave money as if I were in church giving my tigths to God. I received coupons at entrance to purchase a book, which was in English. They have in several languages. The book I chose to purchase was a vegetarian cookbook! After this we were given a spoon of water to drink. Then we went into other rooms like a small museum, gift shops, and foods to purchase. They gave as a gift some homemade desserts! At the final end, we were offered a free meal to eat. This was an amazing visit to learn and understand another's culture and religion. I felt very content when I left. Was extremely grateful for the guide I had. I recommend all open minded people to try learning different cultures and faiths and you can at this very beautiful ISKCON Temple! üôè"
"Chanting Hare Rama - Hare Krishna or simply seating in main temple will get you to connect with self and get some inner peace. The beauty and grandness of this temple has always attracted me. Though bit commercialized, it doesn't fail to give the feeling of someone beyond human‚Ä¶"
"It's a spiritual place, where we can spend time there calm environment and all amenities are there. Kids and family will enjoy being there, always crowded and safe place. Surrounding is very neat and clean."
One of the modern popular temples. Dedicated to God Krishna. Popular tourist destination. Plan for first or early morning visit of  the day.
Very good temple. Serves excellent food in their canteen - pure vegetarian as well as without onion and garlic.
If to see something in Bangalore then this temple is a must to see. Be prepared for crowd especially during weekends but definitely worth to queuing
Hare Krishna!Need I say more? Yes. Very green campus with excellent facilities and logistic arrangements.
Visited the temple on janamashtami. Loved the way temple was decorated and the day well spent. So many activities to do and feeding the cows was so much fun and who's miss the prasadam..
"When I visited, the place was fairly crowded. The temple was clean and was constructed beautifully. Krishna shrine was huge and ample space for people to sit. However, in order to exit the temple, the management has a commerical pitch like any other temple wherein you have food stalls and other small shops within. Eveything inside is priced high!"
"Easy access for the old, lift with least walk. Well organised even when very busy. Loads of devotees. Beautiful temple decor. Saw aarti. Got prasad."
"It is a very good Krishna temple. Very neat and clean. Well managed, well appointed and spacious. Very good arrangement for Darshan. One can peacefully make Darshan. Very good eatery with hygienic food at very reasonable rates. Good parking. Recommended for visit."
Visiting iskon is like my friends favorite thing as u get pongal as prasad and they love it. It's easily visited as there is metro nearby like 500 mtrs away. The place has a nice calm and wen I visited there was bhajan going on which was great
First impression from outside is temple is nice and tidy. Feel the temple is more of a commercial place than a devotional place. One does not get a feel like  you get visiting any other age old temple.
Nice and calm place. We get very relaxed at this place. Surrounding of this place is good. Quite near to Metro Train too.
Visited as part of tour of Bangalore.  Made it the first stop - so there by 10am and was therefore quite quiet - looking at the queue barriers I would imagine it gets very busy.  The serenity of the temple is evident and the spectacle of the gold and colours is awe inspiring.
Spending lovely day out with friends on weekends...like to visit again and again . Lovely temple and very interested people of India .
"A temple which attracts a lot of devotees and tourists. Situated on Chord Road, near Sandal Soap Factory, it has become one of Bangalore‚Äôs landmark.  The main temple is for Lord Krishna and his consorts. Regular poojas are held and for devotees who have paid for specific poojas,‚Ä¶"
"Visit this temple for a holistic sampling of Hinduism. Dedicated to Lord Krishna, the divine cowherd, the majestic temple offers orderly, meticulous worship in a cool marble ambience. The prasad or culinary offering to the Lord,incorporates delectable vegetarian delights from‚Ä¶"
Fabulous location and divinely inspired.  Very safe for kids and all the facilities are awesome.   Don't miss this place if your are visiting Bangalore. 
The place is located about 300 m from the metro station. Getting in of course is a task so select your time carefully. The queue can get very long and tiring. Once inside you can spend some time to look at the architecture and some photos. Getting inside the owner temple also is‚Ä¶
"Our First visit to Isckon, Bangalore has left us with extreme calmness in mind and made us feel pious. The entire place was very clean and vibrant. Display of Krishna souvenir and prasada attracted everyone. It's definitely a must visit place at Bangalore."
"Visited the very popular ISKCON temple on a weekday afternoon. The place is very well maintained, and wasn't that crowded. The access was very easy and there were a large variety of eatables and prasadam also available. To escape the city traffic, it's highly recommended to use the metro rail to reach this Krishna temple."
"ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) is not a traditional temple like others. It is mostly for tourists (international especially) who would like to see a temple. The temple is clean and there are 2 small temples before you reach to main one. There is special entrance as well with some fees. Normal entry there are 2 ways, one is direct to temple and another one has 108 stone slabs where you chant ""Hare Krshna"" mantra 108 times and then enter. Pros:Its very clean and neat. Well Organized.Cons: After you cross temple premises, it looks like shopping Mall. Trying to sell stuff in the name of Krishna."
"Have been there multiple times and the place is good attraction for Tourist. Right outside the metro station, the place is easily accessible. Can take a few hours to complete the darshan   "
"However this place is little commercialised but anyways they have maintained it superbly, ambience is filled with mesmerising smell, bhajan kirthan sound will make you feel divine. please check the timing before you go else your long journey will become futile."
Its a beautiful and amazing place offers a different vibration all together. Be there for a while and don't speak a word and you can feel astonishing peace. It might take you to cry even. This feeling can not be described in words.
"This was a truly holistic experience. I recommend buying the VIP ticket for 500 rupees. Once passes the ticket hall, you will have to rent a bag to place your shoes into (2 rupees per person). Be ready to walk through the temple bare feet having washed hands and feet. Handover‚Ä¶"
"Come here to spend about 2 hours. You get to see this immense building of temple built on a small hill near Mahalakshmi Layout. The nearest metro station is Mahalakshmi Layout and Sandal soap factory metro is also next close one. The temple provides normal entry for free as well as special entry for Rs.300 for a family  which comes along with 4 laddu as Prasad and a book worth Rs.70. The route for special Darshan is shortened.The Darshan means the view of Lord Krishna is just simply fascinating. Lord Krishna is seen with Radha, also seen with Balrama.It takes about 25 minutes on a weekday to reach Lord Krishna's idol from the start.After the Darshan there are stalls to buy books, clothes, toys and others that are related to Iskcon and Hare Krishna Hare Ram. Also there are stalls to have variety of good food, snacks and sweets.Free prashad is provided to all visitors during the exit.There is also a restaurant located at the base when you exit the top building where you can have meals on table."
situated on a hillock and very near to Metro station. climbing steps maybe hindrance for senior citizens. idols are of marble &remind you of North india temples. delicious prasadam is served here. as usual marketing of sri krishna books and audio here also as in other Iskcon‚Ä¶
I went for Aarti and it is truly beautiful. Photography is strictly prohibited but we can‚Äôt resist to click. Be prepared for long walk to enter and exit the main Garbha temple.  Accomdation is available inside the temple which is good and decent. Food is great and the Prasadam‚Ä¶
"Located in the heart of the city, you can't miss it if you're in Bangalore.   Must visit, beautiful temple."
The ISKCON temple in its grandeur is the site to behold. Looks beautiful under lights. Very good place to visit during festival time
"Ganagapur in gulbarga district is the famous temple place of lord Dattatraya. Wanted to visit since long time, finally got a contact there Trimurty Residency, 9980532880 Datta pujari who helped guiding us and providing accommodation food at very low price. He is priest in temple‚Ä¶"
"Located in yeshwanthpur, ISKCON is one of the must visits if you are in Bengaluru.The whole place is well maintained and decorated.It gets closed by 8 30 on weekends. Sometimes it will get difficult to park four wheeler on special/weekends."
