"Overall, we really enjoyed this tour! The hike up to the volcano was a little difficult and the guides walk at a fast pace (stopping twice throughout the hike to provide details about the volcano), but it's manageable. Being lowered down into the magma chamber is cool in itself, but to look around at the bottom is simply amazing. I would recommend this tour!"
"The tour inside the volcano was an amazing experience. Arriving at the ski cabin the very nice and friendly tour guides gave us a quick summary of the schedule for the next couple of hours. Afterwards we walked through the snow to the volcano which took us around 45 minutes. After the arrival at the foot of the volcano we could heat up with coffee and tee. Getting ready with safety harness and helmet we were good to climb up to the crater an the ""elevator"" which took us down."
"This is a totally unique experience and I would highly recommend. The hike to the volcano isn’t difficult...it’s primarily a flat gravel path. You should definitely wear sturdy shoes and a wind-resistant jacket & gloves — other than that, you’ll be fine. The hike to/from and the scenery all around is nearly as enjoyable as the volcano experience itself. This is a very well run tour. We got picked up directly at our hotel and everything from the hike in, directions at the base camp, info from the guide inside the volcano, lunch afterward, etc. were top notch. It’s an expensive day - but one I’d do again in a heartbeat. I’ve traveled all over the world and done everything from the bridge climb in Sydney to hiking Machu Picchu. This day was up near the top of most memorable experiences!"
This is a great hike and trip into the volcano! Was very interesting! Highly Recommended. The only down side is that we didn't get to see Ima the Arctic Fox. Maybe next time!
"We had a terrific time on this tour!  Our guides were extremely knowledgeable. Descending into the magma chamber was truly an unforgettable experience.  We had plenty of time to explore once inside the volcano.  Great hospitality at base camp!  Definitely a ""must see"" when exploring Iceland."
"Such an amazing and unique experience! The walk to and from the volcano was very nice and easy (the rugged Icelandic scenery was just amazing).  Being inside the volcano and hearing about its history was quite enjoyable and breathtaking.  It was also nice to chill at the base camp and eat soup / relax.  I was lucky enough to see the arctic fox that hangs around (she was definitely a bonus!).   Also, my husband and I were originally supposed to take this tour in the morning, but our flight into Reykjavik was very delayed and we arrived close to midnight.  But luckily we were able to easily switch our tour time to one of the later ones in the day no problem so we could be well rested."
"We had a great time during this excursion. Everything from the guides and staff to the hike and going into the volcano were well managed. From the very first to the last we felt welcomed and in good hands by the staff and guides. It is in many ways a family run business and it feels that way by the way they are proud of their business and passionate about what they do. We actually enjoyed the hike out and back almost as much as going into the volcano itself. It’s a beautiful landscape. Being in he volcano, of course, is almost indescribably cool. As they keep each group small the experience was intimate and not stressful at all. One last note. I am a person who gets nervous about tight spaces and sometimes with heights. I was bothered by neither. I had no problems going down on the lift or walking around in the caldera. If you have the time and the money I would highly recommend this excursion. Just remember to book ahead as they always sell out."
"This was an amazing experience! I’m so glad I did it. The views were astonishing, and the tour guide Bryndis was fun, friendly, and helpful.  I totally recommend doing this, especially if you have a shorter stay in Reykjavík. You will feel like you’ve voyaged to another world.Overall, this is an extremely responsible, safety-conscious group , and I highly recommend this. Also, as a solo female traveler, I still felt completely integrated into the small group and enjoyed my time hiking in with them. Some of the descriptions of the hiking made this sound more extreme than it is. It is a flat hike on a well-groomed gravel path until the last 10 minutes, which takes you up a moderate slope after having a coffee break/rest period in their hut. I’m not in great shape, and I did it with no problem.  Pack mittens and a hat."
I was incredibly impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of the tour guides and the experience itself. Going inside the magma chamber of an inactive volcano is just incredible. The set up of the elevator and being able to walk around inside is surreal. The traditional soup afterwards felt hospitable. They give you protection gear. The walk through the lava fields was educational but not as necessary. You also have to wait  for everyone to finish before the return to the parking site.
"This was a unique and educational experience.  Started with an easy hike to the volcano.  Enjoyed getting out and being active, but it was not a hard hike.  Once at the volcano, they send you down the elevator in shifts.  It was not scary (but if you are really afraid of heights it might be difficult for you).  It was amazing to be inside a real volcano, got a brief education from the guides.  The guides were also happy to take family pictures for everyone.  Back up at the top they have 2 people making homemade lamb stew, it was delicious and a great way to relax before heading back.  Because we drove there ourselves (not a bus tour), they let us hike back when we were ready and at our own pace.  We enjoyed being by ourselves for a bit.  Definitely recommend!"
"It was an amazing experience from start to finish.  Started the tour at the base camp where the guide tells you what to expect for the day.  Make a long (45 min) hike with stops and highlights (lava fields, lava tube, tectonic plates, craters, etc.) along the way to the base of the volcano.  There we were given more instructions and safety equipment.  We met their arctic fox mascot-so cute!  Finally it was time to walk the short distance to the top and board the lift down inside the volcano.  I am afraid of heights and was nervous about doing this except the rest of my group was excited and surprisingly I was fine.  I felt very safe strapped both on the short bridge to the lift and inside the lift.  And as soon as we started descending - which was a very smooth trip - I was so mesmerized by all the colors that I forgot to be scared.  Inside the volcano it was magical.  All the colors and just the science behind how it is still standing and how it was found is just amazing.  Had a chance to walk around and take lots of pictures.  Headed back up and back to the volcano camp for some absolutely delicious soup before heading back on the hike to the base camp.  My family of young adults and older teens absolutely loved this.  All the guides and house managers were friendly and helpful.  Everyone who worked there was knowledgable and seemed to really enjoy the work."
"Inside The Volcano was a wild, but memorable experience. It is one of my favorite memories from my trip to Iceland! First, the staff was incredible. They are hilarious, and they make sure you are comfortable every step of the way.Unfortunately, we endured this experience in poor weather, so it was definitely something I will never forget because of trying to walk in the pouring rain and high winds. So, make sure to ALWAYS check the weather. If you're feeling adventurous, just make sure to wear rain pants and come prepared to get a little bit soaked. Overall, I loved going inside the volcano because the tour guides gave us awesome information about it, made sure we were safe before going down, and provided us with a view like no other. Truly something spectacular for any age. Get ready for the hike of a lifetime if you do it, because it's worth every penny!"
Great attraction! The trip into and out of the volcano was a highlight. You spend about 45 minutes in the magma chamber which is more than enough time to explore it fully. Waiting for you when you come out is hot soup made by the guides - a delight!
"Really unique, fascinating, amazing.  A wonderful experience inside the volcano.  Others have explained it well.  I would say that the walk is fairly long, but mostly level, so not particularly strenuous, although our guide set a pretty ambitious pace.  We were offered raincoats, if we wanted them, because there was a threat of rain.  It is pretty cool inside the volcano itself.  I would suggest that if you have your own car, you should drive yourself to the location.  Taking the bus adds a lot of wasted time on either end.  Having your own car also allows you to depart early from base camp, if you want, rather than having to wait until the whole group is ready to go."
"This was a great experience for my family. We drove to the ski lodge (meeting point) and enjoyed the hike to base camp with the group.  The trail was a super easy hike (gravel path to basecamp across lava field).  Honestly, this could be done with any type of closed toed shoes.  The experience inside the volcano was incredible.  The ride down was probably my favorite. All staff were friendly, knowledgeable and fun.  The lamb stew hit the spot at the end of the excursion.  Was it worth the high cost for a family of 4?  My answer would be DEFINITELY!"
"Such a unique experience. Don't miss it! It's a trek to get to the volcano, and on the day we went, it was extremely windy. Be sure to bring a backpack so you're prepared for any unforeseen weather. Though the temperature was lower inside the volcano, it was actually quite nice inside (no wind!)."
"The trip was well organized and we got the experience we were hoping for. Going down into the chamber was thrilling, amazing, a one-of-kind experience. The tour guide was knowledgeable about the history and science of this rarity. The soup provided (vegetarian/vegan or lamb) was awesome - very well seasoned."
"Six of us, ages 26-66, thoroughly enjoyed it. Never experienced anything like it. The guides were excellent. Truly once-in-a-lifetime. And the best soup I've ever eaten in my life! Thank you all!"
This was truly a great excursion. Enjoyed it with our adult daughter traveling with us. Being able ti see inside a magma cave was amazing. Hike up and trail inside are not for people unsure of foot. Our group tried both types of soup and enjoyed by all.
"Really enjoyed this. Our guide, “T”, was great. Informative and funny. Approximately a 2 mile hike each direction but easy walking. The lift down inside the volcano is quick and it’s a great and colorful view down.  Once down, you get about 30 minutes to walk around and take picture. Time wise, it’s perfect as you start to run out of pictures to take and then it’s back up. They offer soup when your finished but I passed so I can’t comment on it. Walk back was on your own but enjoyable since you can stop and take pictures at leisure."
"It was really an amazing experience entering into the earth where volcano erupted and nature left it for us to visit and see what it has. Took so many pictures, but none of them really reflected what was visible to our eyes. Felt the price a bit higher per person, but it is all to do with the effort they are taking to take us safely and giving the experinece of inside the earth and bringing us back."
"This trip is really amazing, app. 40 minutes away from Reyklavik we visited the inside of a volcano. Its an experience that we will remember forever. Bring good and warm clothing - you have to walk 45 min each direction and we spent 40 min in the volcano. Very expensive (44.000 ISK for each adult and kid but worth every cent!!!)"
This is an amazing experience. Fascinating and unique for everyone regardless of whether you are interested in the geology. The colours are beautiful and the huge chamber makes one feel very small. Was amazed how clean and pure the air was within the chamber. The staff were all fantastic and if I had the chance I would do it again.
"This was a great tour!  It was a 3km hike in over amazing landscape and then, 3km back.  Follow the clothing guidelines.  They provide excellent rain coats, but your lower legs and feet can get soaked, so solid water proof hiking boots and pants were key.  The staff were awesome.  The stew was magnificent.  Of a week in Reykjavik, this was my 18 year old daughter's favorite excursion."
"No doubts, it is an amazing excursion. First for what you see (unique) and second thanks to their wonderful staff (so customer service oriented). Thank you for that really nice time guys ! (If I would remember our guides names, they would have a big mention on this review: they were amazing !)."
"Stunning an overwhelming experience, that you should not miss.First you do an about 45min hike with through a lava field and a stunning view.An Elevator then brings you down about 120m into the volcano. Still nobody knows, why this volcano didn't collaps (as they obviously usually do). Something really very special - with big heartbeat moments!"
"Visiting the volcano was amazing.  A quick, easy hike brought us to the base camp where we were outfitted and split into small groups.  Once we went down into the volcano come we were able to walk around an explore the area.  Our guide was friendly, open and informative.  We had 40 minutes to look around, take pictures and explore.  The rock formations and colors are incredible.  After our return to basecamp we were offered a tasty soup and then hiked back to the drop off point.  This was an amazing and once in a lifetime experience that can't be found anywhere else!"
"Heard about this excursion called Inside the Volcano. Sounded exciting so I signed up. They were very helpful with my last minute decision to go. It was my wife’s special birthday, which was the reason for our trip to Iceland in the first place. She was not in the mood for a 2 mile hike to get to the volcano and even less excited about going down into one. Some people are just more adventurous than others. She insisted that I go without her and that is one of the things I love about her. The trip was absolutely fantastic!! Maybe not for everybody, though. For those interested but a bit squeamish the staff is wonderful. Very safety conscious as well as fun to be with. They provide additional weather protection if you don’t bring your own. The two mile hike to the volcano was not bad at all. Very interesting looking at the volcanic rocks and caves along the way. With the guide giving us history and explaining what we were looking at. At the base camp we were given detailed instructions on what to expect, given helmets and fitted with a harness. Very safety conscious! When we got up to the volcano we were hooked up as we walked across a short, very safe and sturdy metal bridge and then hooked up when we got to the elevator device that takes you down. I can’t begin to describe the excitement going down into the volcano and the view and experience from the bottom looking up. The vastness, the rocks, the crevices and the various colors caused by the different minerals were mouth dropping. We got about a half an hour at the bottom of the volcano itself. The ride down and up was exciting in and of itself. This was a fantastic experience. Afterwards we got to the base camp where they served us traditional Icelandic meat soup or vegetable soup and coffee tea or hot chocolate to get us warmed up and ready for the 2 mile hike back to the parking lot. If you like to hike and you like exciting experiences you MUST put this on your list.   A special shout out to all of the guides and staff who couldn’t have been friendlier more knowledgeable,or more helpful. Watching them interact with their  wild little friend was an added treat. All I can say is WOW!!! Just do it!"
"Outstanding experience.  Extremely well organized.  Enjoyed every moment from hiking across the lava, chatting with the informative fun guide, exploring the depths of the volcano, to eating the soup.  Pricy but you can't do this anywhere else in the world.  Travelled with 11 and 14 year old kids - they're fairly fit and did it no problem.  Strongly recommended."
"Just an amazing experience like no other. It starts with a real friendly staff and the hike to to volcano just builds up the anticipation. Once down in the volcano we got to have around 45 min to take pictures. Being solo the tour guide was nice enough to take some pictures of me inside. To finish off the tour you get some delicious Icelandic meat soup.It's expensive but worth every cent, highly highly recommend it. Made this Canadian's experience unforgettable. Thank you to the Inside the Volcano team."
"We saved this experience for the last full day of our trip. It was phenomenal! The crew was great... informative and helpful... but the volcano gets credit. Standing inside the cavity of this geological wonder was awe-inspiring. The easy two mile hike gives you enough time to anticipate the experience on the way out and savor it on the way back. Mori (sp?) the arctic fox was a bonus. Inside the Volcano was the only organized tour we scheduled for our week trip to Iceland. It was a splurge, and totally worth it."
"Don't miss this experience!  A little pricey but well worth it.  We were fortunate to have clear weather and the views were amazing before we even got into the volcano.  It's a longish trek so bundle up if it's chilly.  The inside of the volcano is beautiful, and the guides were very informative and friendly.  Plus some hot soup at the end!   Grade it an A+."
"My wife and I took this tour 3 days ago and both feel it was well organized, informative, invigorating & awesome. The walk to the volcano entrance allowed you to really get close to the Icelandic topography that isn't always possible. The trip down into the volcano and stay at bottom revealed magnificent colors and a layered history of Iceland. Make sure you have good walking footwear for the uneven path. They do supply raincoats if you don't have your own gear.As a bonus when we arrived back on the surface the staff had soup ready for all.  It was so good I got the receipt. The typical Icelandic weather probably helped how good it  was to have soup at that time.I highly recommend this tour."
"My 2 sons and I voted this as the coolest thing we saw in Iceland! Scenery was great, Hike to the volcano was beautiful. Staff was very experienced, welcoming and kind. Equipment was in excellent condition and being inside a volcano was a once in a lifetime event! Do this if you can!!!"
"Enjoyed each of the well trained and prepared guides that brought the history of this only accessible volcano in the world, to life. Breath-taking sights inside the volcano with lots of opportunity for questions and viewing."
