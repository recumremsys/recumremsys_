"This is a must visit place at Ranthambore. Not very difficult to hike up to the Fort. This place has Hindu temples, Jain temples,Dargah, a beautiful garden. There is small Shiva temple tucked below a large structure near the entrance at the top of the hill, do not miss it. Offers wonderful panaromic views of zone 3 of the Ranthambore National Park. You can easily spend 2-3 hrs here. Great place to see, beware of monkeys and langurs here though.."
"It is up the Ranthambore fort- worth a visit for the enjoyable trek up the hill. The temple itself is nothing spectacular or unusual. Avoid carrying sweets or eatables as this can attract monkeys, although they dont do any harm usually."
"The temple is located in the heart of the Fort. You have to climb a lot to get to it. But, on the way, you will realize it is revered by locals. Bow your head & have the prasad. The outside of the temple has monkeys & langurs.If you've any kind of food in your hand, they'll try to snatch it from you. Right outside the temple, you can get refreshments as well as offerings for the deity."
"Situated at the end of Ranthambore fort, it's a long hike to the temple. Surrounded by may be a ton of monkeys, they stare right at you, making a poker face. Try not to take any eatables in front of them, surely will get snatched. A peaceful place it is, being a hindu devotee it…"
A heritage temple in the national park its about 1000 years old ...and a good place for trekking. With an amazing view from the top. Beware of monkeys..
its a good experience to go on the top. most of the parts of fort not open for visitors. jain temple is also mid way. be careful of monkeys while going to temple. beautiful view from the top as well as in between.
Temple was situated on the hills after the ranthambore fort.  Good to many monkeys on the way.  Beware of monkeys when carrying food items with you. Enjoy the gypsy ride to the base of the temple. 
"The location is good inside the fort , the way to the temple is good. Enjoyed the fort more than the temple."
"It was a trekking for us. Had to climb a lot for Ganesh temple. The fort is surrounded with a lot of monkeys. Do not carry any food items along with you while climbing the fort. The darshan was good, we couldn’t eat the prasad As the monkeys took the entire ladoo box from our hand. While going back one monkey jumped on a car next to ours and broke the front glass of the car. Not recommended to take your private car to this place."
"The temple is said to be of ancient origin. A small temple but people seem to have immense faith in it. Crowded with langurs who are eager to snatch edibles from you.As you approach the temple, you will notice innumerous small small stone assemblies.. these are the structures people make here wishing for the materialisation of their house dreams..The surroundings for sure can be better maintained and cleaner."
Very nice temple. It is situation in the fort. Requires some effort to reach though. About 250 steps and a long walk in the fort. Keep about 2 to 2.5 hours to so this leisurely. Also watch out for monkeys. They are everywhere and can snatch anything in hand. Gives great view of the tiger reserve from the top of the fortTemple is neat and clean with no fuss. Small stalls there to serve tea and snacks.
This temple is located in the ranthambore fort. Around 1 km walk to reach the temple. Walk is a bit tiring. Lot of langurs on the way to reach the temple. Ranthambore fort is not in a good condition as there is no maintenance.
Ganesh temple is very revered. Takes around half an hour to reach the top of the temple on foot. Temple is on the way to tiger safari. Everyone says that If you see white rat in the temple your all wish are come true.Be aware of the black monkeys.
"It's a must visit place if you are in Ranthambore.It is a temple made inside the fort.It is located inside the national park region and during the journey, you will find many wild animals. If lucky, you may see a tiger as well.The view of the pond from the top is amazing.The route is a bit tough due to uneven and long steps. Also the route is really hectic for the old people.If you are coming from the city than bring your own car or you will have to hire jeeps to go up and down the fort and still you have to walk a lot.Although the breathtaking view from the top kills the fatigue, but still I won't suggest it for the old people with high BP.Tip: Make sure you don't carry any colorful object with you due to monkey snatching on the route. Thousands of monkeys are there snatching items from tourists. Make sure to put your camera handy and sticky and don't click them by calling them out."
"Inside Ranthambhore Fort, this is the biggest attraction. Most people visit the fort for this temple. A number of monkeys around. They don't trouble you unless you do anything stupid. The arrangement for visitors is no different than any other similar Hindu temple. Look out for monkey art along the way similar to one attached."
Another must see place at Ranthambore. Climbing on through the fort on Steep hill is really exciting and really a memorable event.
"This was a true Indian experience where you learn more about the culture of the area and see the gorgeous temples. Also, you can feed wild monkeys here, which was amazing! Note there are quite a lot of steps, so moderate fitness required."
You need to trek a lot to visit this temple. Traffic problem is there so better park your vehicle down itself. Enjoy the pictures.
Make the climb to view the entire landscape surrounding the fort. The journey to this temple will let you experience the lush flora and fauna within the area as well.
Excellent place to visit. Having few temples at the top of the hill. Having few lakes. Total 300 steps to reach at the top of the hill which is known as Ranthambore Fort.
It's one of the most beautiful trek to one of the most famous temples in Rajasthan. Just the drive to entrance takes you through the ranthambore forest. The trek starts from 1st gate of ranthambore Fort and by the end you are through whole of the fort. Do hire a guide to properly go through various points in the fort.
beautiful location of temple inside the fort. Nice view around. was not too overcrowded when we visited.
Visiting a fort and a temple together is rare. You can enjoy the view of safari park and lakes from the top of fort which is a historical site enlisted in the UNESCO World Heritage list.
Make sure you make the time to visit the fort and the temple. The views are spectacular the people are amazing
The Ganesh temple within the Ranthambore fort is a very lively temple. Already the way to the temple through the fort is wonderful. Take your time to observe the scenery. Also non-Hindus are welcome.
Went early in the morning to visit the temple.  Lovely walk up lots of stairs to a stunning view over the forrest and lake.  While there visit the Shiva linga in a small cave as well.  The monkeys love to eat the garlands there so be aware and surrender them quickly
Very old temple of lord Ganesha and his family. Situated in Ranthambore fort. must visit. Dont forget to take the guide with you otherwise you will not enjoy the fort
It is located on ranthambore fort. Very good temple located on 500 steps to top. Be aware from monkeys.
Luckily we had a guide to Ranthambhore Fort which made it very interesting. Although I have knee trouble I didn't find the walk to the Temple too difficult. I enjoyed learning about the history and the customs. There were plenty of Langur monkeys at the temple which people feed so they are extremely tame. Being so high there are some stunning views of the park and lakes.
Temple is atop a hill near Ranthambore Fort. It is a must visit temple. Lord Trinetra Ganapati alongwith his family is a very beautiful sight. A peaceful place where Lord surely resides.  Praise Lord Ganesha.
A must visit site in Sawai Madhopur. A unique temple with a Self evolved statue of Ganesh. Felt completely at peace here.
"The temple is located in the Ranthambore Fort.  Getting to the Fort requires a moderately difficult climb of about 300 steps from the parking lot at its base.  This 5th century fort built by King Hammir, is the second largest, the largest being Chittorgarh.  There is very little…"
"It's a small, peaceful temple is situated inside Ranthambore fort which itself is in the Jungle. There is not much architecture or grandeur here. But, it's very famous among believers.  There are around 225-250 steps (easy steps) and then 1/2 - 1 km walk inside fort. Walk is…"
Ganesh temple is one of the very few places to visit in Sawai Madhopur after the National Park. So do visit once you are here in town. It has a steep climb up the fort and you will find a lot of langoors near the temple. So do not carry and stuff in your hand as there is good possibility that it might be snatched. Try to keep  your hands free while you are here. Good thing that you will find many people on your way offering free water.
"Visiting Ganesh temple at Ranthambore is an excellent experience. you will find many animals out on the way to temple. From entry gate, we can take car/cab and rich to the stairs of Ganesh temple which is little tough to climb but you will enjoy the height as well. while climbing beware from monkies, they will snitch your belongings. so please don't carry any stuff with you special any foodstuff.After you reach the temple there is a lake to view and you can see the forest on top of the mountain it's beautiful.Ganesh temple is small but very much popular as its the Temple of marriage in Hindus. People send their invitation cards from around the world to call Ganeshji in their weddings. overall its best in morning hours as Rajasthan is litle hot."
