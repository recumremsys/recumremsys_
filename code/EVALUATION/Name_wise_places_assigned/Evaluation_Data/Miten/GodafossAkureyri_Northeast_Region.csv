We travelled all of Iceland on the ring road. Saw a total of 6 of the most famous waterfall. This one was SPECTACULAR! Did not want to leave. Would have loved to have sat there for hours and enjoyed lunch. Would highly recommend stopping there.
For me it is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Iceland. It is not that tall but is wide. It is worth to do the trail on both sides since it provide two different perspectives of the waterfall. Loved the color of the water
Not only is the waterfall well worth a trip to but the surrounding countrysude is beautiful. The falls look like a small Niagara. Recommended.
For me this is a top 5 waterfall. It’s huge. It’s horseshoe shaped. It has a side fall. Work on the walkway gave up close exposure to those brave enough to walk the uneven surface to the top of the falls. There are 2 points on each side of the river to view the falls. See it from both sides. Also we were staying in the area so in the evening it was raining but by the next morning the side rain had stopped. It’s better without the sideway rain. Plan time to walk and see.
"Loved this waterfall. So powerfully beautiful, like all waterfalls there is always a hike to get to them but so worth it."
"Powerful falls, but not the most interesting or beautiful of Iceland’s many waterfalls. Quite off the road as well if you’re in a rush. Take the western route to get there, not the road along the east coast."
Absolutely wonderful. Go early as possible to avoid the crowds.The waterfall was amazing and among the top ones from all of Iceland.
"This was our favourite waterfall in Iceland. Easy to access from car park with a bridge that linked both sides of the waterfall. As we reached about 8 am, the area was not crowded with tour groups and we were able to take our time to enjoy views from both sides, including a rainbow. Do visit early in the morning."
"Beautiful waterfall in Akureryi, Iceland. Scenic drive through the mountainous roads to get to this pretty waterfall from glacier runoff. Trails to walk and souvenir/food/restrooms available. Tour guide told us about the countryside and legend of the falls. Dress warmly in May and expect snow."
"There are so many beautiful and mighty waterfalls in Iceland; I believe more than in Hawaii. The Godafoss waterfall we liked best. It is unique, it actually consists of 3 individual waterfalls. Left and right one big each, in the middle a small waterfall."
"You can walk all around these falls, some were going so near the edge, but they seem to be in the process af building viewing areas with barriers to stop the public from approaching too close. I can understand why, because there were so many people near the edge! At the moment you can go all around the falls including down to the waters edge, the steps are a little precarious and sturdy footwear is necessary. The general pathway on the top is a very easy walk though. There is also a cafe which is clean and the facilities are good. Allow a couple of hours to enjoy this lovely site."
Raining on and off when we visited although it was still worth a visit.  There are quite a lot of waterfalls in Iceland and this was one of my faves to visit.  Easy to walk around the perimeter and not too far a walk for those with walking difficulties.  Plenty of car parking spaces too.
Saw amazing Godafoss waterfalls. Fantastic place. Our tour guide took us walking around the area and there is a coffee shop here too for welcome warmth from the cold!
"A very impressive and easy to find waterfall which is so big, that you won't have any trouble with crowds.  Looks like a smaller version of Niagra Falls.  But with cool trails that you do.  There are parking lots and trails on each side of the falls.  It is located on the north side of Iceland."
"Located right on the Ring Road, this big, beautiful waterfall  is very accessible, and so very popular. We opted to hike up to the back of the falls, along newly constructed pathways - leading to gravel - leading to corded-off areas - leading to a simple ""BEWARE"" sign. Once we reached the falls, it was free exploration around the rock pools, trying not to get our feet wet, staying clear of the edge of the water. Down below, at the lower viewpoint, we watched crowds of people unload from buses in the main parking lot, and fill the pathways. We had clearly chosen the path less traveled, and thankfully so. Godafoss was beautiful and worth the stop regardless of the people, but for those searching for all the services and ease of access, you'll find that too, in the main parking lot. This is the waterfall for everyone."
Visited here just after Xmas and what a breathtaking place. You can walk quite close to the waterfall. The colour of the water is amazing. This is a must see if you in this part of northern Iceland.
"This was a powerful, gorgeous waterfall, on the way to Myvatn.  Had to stay wrapped up as the winds picked up in this place!"
Nice waterfall to 50 meters from the ring road. Easy to walk. I suggest to see it from both side. Stop ann enjoy
"Iceland is so blessed with nature.  We planned to see several waterfalls, but this was not planned.  Thank god we passed by and noticed it.  It is a beautiful waterfall, unspoiled, similar to most waterfalls, and not commercialized.  You can just walk around this beautiful waterfall, enjoy the huge amounts of water rushing through and taking pictures."
"The falls and the aqua blue river flowing past the walking bridge - incredible.  Natural beauty with great walking area. Dress warmly - we were there in September and it was quite windy, we were well bundled and needed to be. Has a little gift shop with snacks and restrooms."
It is a life-changing experience to stand by big and beautiful waterfalls. Godafoss is one of those waterfalls. Of course Dettifoss and Skogarfoss are bigger but few waterfalls are as beautiful as Godafoss. Don´t miss it!
"Stopped by to see the waterfall. It was quite nice, not particularly spectacular, good walking paths around about in the snow. Cafe, and shop selling heaps of made in China tacky but very expensive souvenirs. Worth a stop, but doesn't take long!"
"Stopped as part of our Iceland tour. While not as huge and powerful as the Gullfoss, this waterfall is beautiful with its horseshoe shape.As you go up the left side, keep a look out on the right of the path for some steps which take you down to the water level. It's rocky down there but you can take photos from a different angle. Just beware the sun will be behind the falls so perhaps not so good on a Summer afternoon.If you found my review helpful I would appreciate your vote."
"Have seen lots of waterfalls. This was another one. It was a stunning, cold snowy day, so it looked quite nice, and was quiet too, so easy to see and get photos.The tourist cafe / shop nearby was full of vastly overpriced tacky souvenirs. Save your money, buy elsewhere"
Do not compare Icelandic waterfalls and if you won't then you will love it. There are standing spots on both sides and you can use both parkings to take multiple photos. Must to do spot.
Put this on your ‘must see’ list when in Iceland. Majestically beautiful. New car park and walking tracks make this an easy area to get around and view the falls from different angles. Cafe and gift shop with toilets make this an ideal destination.
Beautiful stop on the ring road. Well sign posted for Iceland! Has a cafe as well although we didn’t have time to stop there.
You have to go here if you visit Iceland. The waterfall is wonderful and massive. be prepared to do a lot of walking.
It’s an easy walk from a parking area to View this beautiful waterfall. Reminds me of a mini Niagara falls with the US and Canadian shaped water falls.
"A nice walk along paths to this beautiful waterfall.  There is a bridge from one parking lot on the West side of the falls to the Shops and Parking lot on the East side of the falls.  Hiking on both sides.  Do be careful however - this is truly wild nature, and although it looks tamed (paths and bridges are well-maintained) it can still be dangerous."
This Waterfall is close to Akureyri and should be a must see even in inclimate weather. There is a walk from the parking are to the falls. You can enter from both sides. It is really a site To see. Expect to see a number of people here. There is also a coffee shop and gift shop located close by.
We visited Godafoss in June with Arctic Fox Travel. It is truly a awe inspiring to see and feel the beauty and the power of these falls.  Add to it the history and setting in the North of Iceland it makes you realize how we are just a breath in the dawn of the world.
"We almost missed these falls? We arrived by cruise liner at Akureyri and all the tours were were booked out.We went to the Hof at Akureyri the lovely young lady there said that there was possibly the chance of a tour to the waterfall the next morning and she was waiting to hear from the tour company, Midnight Sun Tours.We waited for word until she got sick of us asking and called the tour company, yes the tour would go ahead we paid $75.00 USD and the next morning at ten o’clock we arrived at the bus, a reasonably new and well appointed bus not a huge coach nice and easy to hear the excellent commentary in English by Akri the Icelander tour guide and driver.The trip to the falls was as informative, scenic and interesting as the falls itself, about a one hour trip through farmland, snow capped mountains and lakes.On arrival we were dropped off at the path to the falls, what a fantastic spectacle the glacier melt water is always so clean and looks blue, the water coming from the falls, was beautiful, the path meanders along the river until you see the spectacular falls, much the same shape but a bit smaller than Niagara, the rainbows thrown up on the sunny day were spectacular and the falls mesmerising.A great day, interesting and informative, so glad we did it, if it’s a short tour of about 2.5 hours you want? Do this you will love it."
"You see so many waterfalls in Iceland that there is a danger you will become rather blase. Thankfully each of them is unique and therefore offers a different experience. There is good free parking here on both sides of the river and good paths lead to the falls. When we visited they were building a new viewing platform which I am sure will further enhance the experience. The building work did not negatively impact on our visit as it is low key and small scale. Walking down river from the spectacular falls leads to a further fall and a lovely pedestrian bridge over the river which provides good views of the river and lower falls - you also get a glimpse of Godafoss. At this end there is also a petrol station and cafe where there are pay for toilets. If you go upstream from the falls there are beautiful views of the river and its tributaries. Despite other people being there, it felt very peaceful. We would recommend stopping here."
Come right up close to one of nature's beauties. The is a must see while in Iceland. You can walk around and see it from every angle. Really an amazing experience!
