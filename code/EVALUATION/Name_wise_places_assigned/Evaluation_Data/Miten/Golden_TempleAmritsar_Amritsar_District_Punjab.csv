No one can review God. Harmandir saheb gurudwara is the place to go in joy or sorrow alike. The tranquil water of the pond surrounding the main gurudwara gives peace. Do not forget to have Langar prasad
"Had visited this famous gurdwara in Amritsar a long back ago. It is a popular tourist attraction and is visited by tourists as well as devotees.This gurdwara is a holy place for the Sikhs. It is known as Harminder Sahib. The main Gurdwara is covered in gold leaf which gives it a golden look. There is a sacred pond which is used for ritual bathing. The gurdwara complex has religious centers, langar etc. Inside the main gurdwara, there were bhajan singers and a holy book known as the 'Granth Sahib' enclosed in the middle. Before entering the gurdwara complex, had to remove footwear. A code of conduct should be maintained. Women have to wear scarfs and men should tie a big handkerchief on & around the heads. Had got my head tied with a handkerchief by a man and admired the golden gurudwara as a school going child. It was so calm and peaceful.This gurdwara is an ideal holy place of worship for those who would like to seek blessings. It is a must visit and should not be missed when in Amritsar."
Golden Temple is the main reason for our visit to Amritsar... Try to stay close to the Golden Temple complex so that you can visit Golden Temple in the night... It is a divine experience to see the temple all lit up.In the night you cannot go to the inner sanctum sanctorum but the night time experience is divine.We went again in the morning and had langar which should not be missed.The temple also hosts a Museum of Sikh History and should not be missed.The langar is a community kitchen which serves food to all the people who visit the temple and is a divine experience.Go there and be blessed.
Had a fantastic day in Amritsar.Visited the golden temple in India with a brilliant guide Anil Sharma who gave us a thoroughly entertaining day. A very knowledgable gentleman. Polite and couldn‚Äôt do enough to make this a pleasurable experience.Anyone looking to do this trip would not be disappointed with Anil Sharma +91 9780234705
It is so peaceful when the verses from the Granth Sahib are being read and sung. Walk around the temple and go the library. The best time to enter the temple is before 8am if you want to bow before the Granth Sahib
"Golden temple is nice place to visit. A must to visit in Amritsar. I visited the place recently and it was an amazing experience. Amritsar is cooler than Paris. It was an overcast evening with temperature 2*C but as the sun set and lights lit up, it was a spectacle to behold. It is the holy shrine worshiped by the Sikhs globally and it is open to all people irrespective of their religion. 1. Wearing turban cloth is mandatory for all and is easily available locally. 2. You have remove your footwear for which Temple management has counters to take care of the same. If you are in groups, ask for a gunny bag to keep your footwear together. It was a peaceful and religious experience for me.Please have the 'Halwaa' (Sheera made of pure ghee). It is offered by the Committee to all after coming out of the shrine. It is sweet and healthy. Please have it.Overall nice experience."
"In 2015, we‚Äôve visited many places in India, but our visit to the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, was by far one of the most special. Our guide, Preet, who became a beloved friend, made our tour very special. He took us to see the sunset in the Golden Temple... This ended up being my favorite place in India! And I‚Äôm sure part of the reason for that is because Preet is a unique guide, dedicated and full of knowledge. We finished our tour with a delicious dinner and, until today, after 5 year, we wear a Sikh bracelet that Preet gave us. I‚Äôll never forget what he told us: ‚Äúthese are for you to remember to came back here‚Äù. And we hope we will soon! Thank you, Destiny India Travels! üôèüèº"
"Got an opportunity to visit golden temple this month . This is one of the most important places of sikh religion and is visited by people of all religions every day . This is an awesome structure . There is a langar , which feeds up to 100,000 people / day . Must see if you are in Punjab ."
"We visited golden temple on Sunday. Reached temple premise by 8.30 am.On the way to the temple & inside the compound it was too much crowded. Chanting was going on. Beautiful gold plated  temple surrounded by water , worth to visit."
"It was an amazing trip. Golden Temple is extraordinary, beautiful, peaceful.  Yummy langar, well organised place.Visit to Wagah border was amazing . Ate lot of food, kulcha chole, lassi, parathas etc."
A must visit religious temple when you're in the city of Amritsar. Try visiting during before the sunrise time.
"A beautiful temple of the Sikhs . Very big area with a sacred artificial pond in the middle .4 greatly designed gates from each direction symbolize the openness to all people . In the middle the golden temple where a ceremony is held every night at 2130 , get there not later then 2030. Don‚Äôt miss the biggest free kitchen in the world that feeds 100 thousand people daily, open 24/7 .getting in only barefoot and with a scarf on the head ."
The most important site for Sikhism. Bustling with people all the time. The langar here is must have if visiting Amritsar.
Spent an interesting morning at this holiest of places for Sikhism. Really impressive construction and the social work carried out here by volunteers is something to behold. We were very impressed for the organised way everything is done and how caring and spiritual the environment is.
"If anyone visits Amritsar without intending to see the Golden Temple . . .well, there must be something wrong. The centre of the Sikh religion is a must-see in India and does not disappoint.  Make sure you have a head cover, be comfortable in bare feet (there are storage facilities for shoes), and try to come early.  The crowds start to grow quickly in the morning and don't seem to let up in the evening.  So see the inside of the temple early in the morning, and the outside in both daylight and at night.  A magnificent sight, especially at night.It is also worthwhile to visit the kitchens where thousands of people are served food, without charge, every day.We are not Sikh, but it was clear that this is a special place."
"The Golden Temple is very important to Sikhs; similar to Mecca for Muslems or the Vatican for Roman Catholics.  However, you don't have to be a Sikh to be impressed by the Temple and its surrounding complex.  We visited during the day and thought it was spectacular and went back in the evening and, with the lights, it was even more spectacular.With over 100,000 visitors a day, the Golden Temple is a very busy place.  The ""langer"", or community kitchen, provides free meals to anyone who wants one 24 hours a day - about 100,000 meals a day.Visiting requires a bit of a hike because vehicles are not permitted in the area surrounding the complex.  Then, it's shoes and socks off as the visit will be barefoot.  The temple is in the middle of a large pool that is surrounded by associated buildings.  A visit to the interior of the Golden Temple will require joining a very long line that could require one or two hours before a brief visit.  That's in addition to walking around the complex to enjoy its wonderful exterior appearance.  Allow 1 - 2 hours for a visit plus the time required to stand in line if you want to enter the Golden Temple.  We were more than satisfied with our viewing of the complex without joining the line to enter the temple."
Visited this place on new year. Beautifully built. Stayed here and worshipped for few hours. Construction is amazing. Shops nearby are decorative.
"Were fortunate enough to visit here at night to experience the palki sahib ceremony and then again the following day to see the food being prepared to feed upto 100,000 people every day free of charge. Very moving experience and such a beautiful setting."
"This was my second and my wife's third visit for Darshan .To avoid unprecedented rush on Guru Nanak's 550th birth date, visited a week after (On week day) and had normal crowd every where from Delhi .Since lots of reviews share almost same Stay at Ramada Amritsar was excellent . Since most reviews have repetation , I am sharing exceptions only :1)  Avoid darshan between 6 and 6:30 PM, when evening special prayer done. Try to be slightly early and you can sit down during this prayer.Otherwise ,We were in the middle of the Que,standing still for this additional half an hour, as entry was stopped. Very very straing for senior citizens like us.  2) While coming back in the Swarn Satabdi  in afternoon ,felt like we are still in the same environment of Sri Harminder Sahib. Were in Coach 14 and after start  realised we are with a group of devotees who visit every month 3rd Tuesday from Delhi and come back on Wednesday. They transformed the Coach 13 to a kirtan place and we had live telecast of it in C12, C13 & C14 . In addition, All passengers in these coaches were continuously  served  with excellent quality snacks,drinks and dinner( even to those who are not in the group devotees) ,with no return expectation . Like us,almost every one refused Railway food and engrossed in the Kirtan. This continued almost till the end . We thanked to the Group organisors  This trip will last in our memory for this factor also"
"Absolutely remarkable place for worship unbelievable patience for devotees from the volunteers.. no pushing/ shoving at the sanctum sanctorum, despite very high turn out of people. Visited temple 6 times in almost 3 days at different times.. it was the same. Also, cleanliness and hygiene was mind blowing"
"I am a young Punjabi Woman born and bred in London. I have visited the golden temple in the past when very young,and remember the experience being lovely with my Nan and family. This time it was different I had taken my Fiance there for the first time. Walked around and had langar with my whole family. We took pictures and after taking a selfie we were surprisingly stopped by one of the sevadars (helpers/staff) and told abruptly and rudely to delete the selfie. I asked why? And he replied because I did not have my scarf on my head. I was confused because I did. So I looked back at the picture and showed it to him and he still disagreed. (I took the picture from above and mine and my partners head was tilted slightly back, so in the picture it looked as if I hardly had my scarf on but you can clearly still see it on my head!?) So he stands there and is very intimidating. I refused to delete it because he was wrong. He then puts his hands on the phone, and tries to take it off me. My partner intervened and said we will delete it. So this made me very upset and frankly angry. He ruined the whole day for us, we were so happy when we went in and then that happened and it was all a shock. This young mans attitude was so shocking, I said he had no right to speak to visitors in this manner and should learn some respect as his working in such a sacred and respectable place. This was not the end. We continued to walk,and as he didn't like my confidence in speaking my mind and giving my opinion as a young woman he began to follow us while we were walking inside. We got to the end of the temple, and almost at the exit, where there was two other senior staff members standing. I knew at this point he wanted to go and complain about me. So I let him walk before me and say what he wanted. I then followed after him and said please explain the situation properly don't just say we refused to delete a picture. So I explained the whole situation from the beginning and he still had the nerve to continue to debate and show a dirty attitude even in front of his seniors. I clearly said to them all just because you are given the job of taking care of this sacred place does not give you the right to demand or show aggression, power and authority to innocent people and situations. I did not know or understand what he had against us, but he clearly has an issue. I am Indian Punjabi and my Fiance is European. I am a very spiritual person and respect all places of god and worship. This was a horrible and embarrassing situation for us all. This sevadar (the young staff memeber) began to point his finger at me and threatened for me to be quiet,raising his voice. This made my partner very uncomfortable and he did not understand punjabi or what was happening but just noticed his aggressive behaviour. My partner stepped in the middle as he thought he was going to approach me or get closer. The other senior staff members also held him back and told him to calm down. They had there hands together and asked us for forgiveness. It was too late. I already made up my mind that I would never step foot in that place again. And I said it too. I dont agree with this behaviour and no one should have to go through it. I told them to teach their staff some manners and to remind them that they are working in a holy place and that type of mentality or attitude is not something they should be showing visitors. So today I saw pictures of the Indian actress (Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh) her husband visit there too for their anniversary. Now the amount of hair on her head showing was a lot more than what mine was in the picture I took, yet this whole fuss was made by this ONE man. Im assuming no one bothered her about her hair showing because she's a famous actress right? What rubbish. Not only this. My sister and her husband also visited a year ago, and were told to also delete a picture they had both taken because apparently he was holding her by her waist? I have seen so many pictures of visitors and tourists couples and families do this,but why was it a issue this time? I also believe in the power of treating people with respect,if any of these two men working at the Golden Temple had better manners and a little more respect in how to come across to a Woman and speak to her,I could have handled that situation better myself by just staying calm and actually deleting it. But by the way he approached me and my family he straight away had a major issue with something. What it was I will never know. But this ONE MAN changed our experience there once and for all. I will never visit again unfortunately due to rude staff like him who ruin peoples experiences and family time. The place itself is beautiful,it is unfortunate and sad that they have hired young men like that one who forgot where he was for a minute and what he is actually getting paid or not getting paid to do. My partner and myself will never forget that experience. This is really something the Golden Temple staff should be aware of and take seriously amongst their staff, as we all know word gets around and if it continues this way foreigners and tourists and visitors will stop coming; we are all the people contributing to the economy in Amritsar and the Golden Temple. This would be so sad to see drop if people begin to feel like they are being treated wrongly in such a famous,sacred,holy place like that. I again want to say that this was my experience and I am like every other person who wanted to visit pay my respects and show my family around. This was a horrible experience and one I will never forget."
"Must experience the morning prayers. Having said that, you should see the temple during the day time as well- it is a different experience.Morning time, you should leave around 3AM. Had a wonderful experience. You will feel the power of the temple. People are so polite and doing sewa everywhere. Will surely visit again."
"Calm, peaceful place, situated at the centre of the town.  Do visit all the three floors of the temple.Queue to go inside the temple varies and mostly takes an hour, so plan accordingly"
"Sikhs around the world must be so proud for their legacy having golden temple. . Always a wonderful experience to visit this place. Beautiful monument and even more beautiful people, serving mankind irrespective of their class , creed and religion. . More than 75000 people are fed here without a single question. Most of the work done here is by hundreds of devoted volunteers. . Amaizing üëåüëå"
Feel blessed at the entrance itself. Sikhs are serving water taking care of shoes. There is a carpet path from shoe drop to temple. Recommend to stay in this place from late noon will sunset. Just change of  color and its reflection in water is a lifetime experience.
"The surrounding area around the Golden Temple is best managed by the authorities and hence the flow to the Temple is the most regulated one. Everybody comes in the queue, in discipline, and in good mood. There is a free well-managed service for keeping shoes, chappals. There are adequate counters and the same are managed by adequate well-trained persons. There is no rush, no pushing, no hurry, no authoritative attitude. Its only Faith, Service,Humanity, Discipline, No amount of appreciation can do justice to what the temple authorities perform in their duties to the faithful. Everything is clean, pure, and all sanctity is maintained at all levels. Persons of all faiths come but there is no discrimination, no partiality, no preference, everything is conducted in an orderly manner. You get water, food as prasad, and every care is taken in every manner and in every respect. Faithfuls observe the sanctity, discipline, cleanliness, and there is no need to interfere in the matter. And inside the sanctum sanctorum, you get the Bliss and Peace of mind that cannot be expressed in words or feelings. Compared with Mumbai Ganpati Darshan or Vaishno Devi Darshan the flow of faithfuls is managed in the best manner. I would love to visit the Golden Temple whenever I happen to visit Amritsar. Nice spiritual experience with utmost peace of mind."
I have visited this holy place many a times but the last visit on 31 Dec 2019 was some thing unique. Visited with family to seek blessings for the new year. No words to express the happiness. A PLACE MUST BE VISITED WAHE......GURU... JI  DA KHALSA... WAHE.....GURU  JI  DI FATEH
"The entire gurudwara,it‚Äôs management, the cleanliness and above all the serenity and tranquility one gets visiting this place is unbelievable. Although the queues are long but worthy the wait. There are separate queues for people with young children. We spent 4-5 hours there. Don‚Äôt miss it in the night. It‚Äôs even more serene"
"Let us get straight to the point ‚Äì your religious affiliations kept completely aside, Golden Temple is brilliant & mesmerizing ‚Äì and a must visit place. If I try to remember the iconic tourist places in India, then obviously the Taj Mahal is clearly #1. My place of birth ‚Äì Kolkata ‚Äì and its Victoria Mahal would also be in the list. Delhi with its plethora of monuments including India Gate, Lotus Temple, Red Fort, Akshardham Temple ‚Äì as a tourist destination would be there (this is different issue that being a resident of NCR, my review contributions of Delhi is pitiful ‚Äì may be a 2020 resolution). Also, it would be quite fair to put the Golden temple in the league of brilliant places one must visit in India.The brilliance of the place is due to myriad and complex factors at play ‚Äì not limited to the religious under currents that one associates with a temple. For starters, the wide pedestrian-only access leading to the temple allows one to soak in the cultural heritage of the place. On both sides of the pedestrian zone, one can see numerous shops selling local stuff that range from Amritsari jooti (sandals), to ear rings, and numerous other knick-knacks. The fa√ßade of the place is consistent with homogenous design ‚Äì to such an extent that the Mcdonalds signage gets camouflaged in the background.One reaches the entrance of Golden temple ‚Äì after about 8-10 minutes of walk from Ranjit Singh chowk where the car parks are located. Remarkably, one common problem that tourists face in any famous temple is that of quacks and thugs trying to fleece you ‚Äì however, in the couple of times we went to this temple, we faced no such problems whatsoever. In fact, one incident warrants particular mention. There were number of hawkers selling ear rings ‚Äì and there was this gentlemen with a small suitcase with very limited collection of stuff waiting for his turn. Warmed to his (mis) fortunes, especially when our family was buying ear rings in truck loads, I approached the man and asked him if he was not upset with state of affairs ‚Äì to which he politely said ‚Äì God shall take care of me. No wonder this was Golden Temple in Amritsar ‚Äì a place where a Langar (community kitchen) runs 24 hours ‚Äì and we are told about 75,000 people have free food there DAILY ‚Äì possibly the biggest such community food service in the world. With limited staff manning the kitchen, there are number of voluntary sevaks (care givers who donate their work free for community welfare). After leaving our footwear and collecting a token (again no fees are involved here), we entered the Temple ‚Äì after stepping through a small pool of water to wash our feet. The temple inside was brilliant, mesmerizing and paradoxical. ‚ÄúBrilliant‚Äù because of its sheer expanse and its architecture. In fact, some of the views from high above made the temple look even more fascinating.‚ÄúMesmerizing‚Äù because of the exquisite Golden Glow of the temple seated at the center of Amrit Sarovar (Lake of Nectar or Lake of Holy water), also from where the name of city was possibly derived. The lake was presumed to carry holy water and even in December chill, we saw pilgrims taking a dip.‚ÄúParadoxical‚Äù because walking across the whole periphery I found numerous occasions where ordinary pilgrims were picking trash from the ground and throwing in dustbins ‚Äì and this was same city where just outside you could find number of places where waste was not managed properly. The vast expanse of the temple was spotlessly clean ‚Äì and again we are told that the carpets that lay across the periphery for pilgrims are washed regularly. Keeping such huge compound spotlessly clean was almost a miracle in itself.After traversing the periphery of the lake clockwise, we entered the bridge which led to the Sanctum Sanctorum. It was pretty busy place where crowd movement was very slow. It took us about 1 hour to reach the main temple right in middle of the lake ‚Äì while it was very busy, there was not too much of push. Then there were separate queues for females ‚Äì though few females were part of common queue.Inside the main temple, we made our prayers and came back. Some though were sitting around the central temple and making extended prayers. Almost everywhere one could see thick carpets for sitting of pilgrims. After collecting our prasad, we came out. Apart from the beauty and views, there was an envelope of serenity and calm that had descended the whole place.Late in the evening, we went back only to see the brilliant temple glowing in tremendous glory. Again we are told that temple is open almost from early dawn till 10 in the night ‚Äì so you can schedule your visit accordingly.To sum it, the place should be in your must watch list ‚Äì and if possible, try to visit twice, once in day and another time at night. Go there not just for the beauty but for the elusive peace with the bhajans (religious songs) playing in the background. PS: Some small areas of Improvement at this brilliant place:‚Ä¢	Separate queues for people over 65 years or wheelchair bound people should be created on the bridge ‚Äì like the one made for women pilgrims for their safety.‚Ä¢	Movement of vehicles, pickup/drop near Ranjit Chowk needs to be streamlined‚Ä¢	Pockets of litter near parking lots needs to be cleaned up & Street vendors should be regulated."
Visited in December with family. It is a temple which should be in everyone's must visit list. The temple is very beautiful and large with lake in between. The  temple was very crowded the day we visited & it was extremely cold. However the experience was very good. Had very tasty halwa dripping with ghee as prasad. The place was very well managed by kar sevaks. Only problem was they do not allow baby stroller inside and the campus is huge.
Wonderful experience. Felt like in heaven. The darshan were very smooth. Parshad was hot and nicely done
"If you are in Punjab and looking for an escape for the masses, stop in here.  Take you shoes off and have a nice walk around the reflective pool while gazing upon the holy golden temple."
Visiting the Golden Temple was blissful. Seeking blessings and getting to know the history about it was quite interesting. After seeking blessings we headed towards the langar to offer our service and experience some delicious food.
Bliss for the family. Just the perfect place for peace of mind. Do visit if you go to amritsar. Best part is that people from all faiths are welcome.
Feel the meditation while visiting with family. World's largest kitchen serving Langar.All religious beliefs are welcome to come here
