Very picturesque and full of sights and sounds. Shopping everywhere and historical monuments. I really enjoyed my day in this area. Come early in the morning less people and not as hot!
"the street is really bussy and crowded with many people, but insteresting for exploring. walking around this place is very fun"
Yes the impressive restored Portuguese architectural buildings and flavour is evident and impressive both day and evening. Try the Portuguese egg tarts !!!
Enjoyed the architecture and history of the lovely place.  Vibrant and colourful.with people everywhere.  The local food was amazing.
"Old Macau is stunningly beautiful and it is such fun to wander the historic alleyways aimlessly. The juxtaposition of this against the prominent newer casino hotels blighting the skyline is also quite surreal. Be aware that whilst a must visit, the small streets become oh so crowded with the tourist hordes - best to turn off the main streets and explore the quieter backstreets."
"When I think of any old city like this I envision something more European with little restaurants and bars, great places to hang out and people watch over a pint. Well Hong Kong and Macau aren‚Äôt much of a drinking culture. After walking through all the old Macau stops (I wrote down a list from an advertised tour) we didn‚Äôt pass a single bar/restaurant/pub. Guessing it‚Äôs a zoning/legal thing but had I known, we would not have gone there, after a couple historic sites there‚Äôs really nothing to do there except go back to the overpriced casino where it also seems frowned upon to drink."
"If you want to see what there is to see beyond the Casinos this is a great place to take in what Macau has to offer.  Architecture, shops, stone work and just lots to look at.  Walk around the surrounding area as well as there is a lot to see outside of the main square."
"the most touristy place of Macau! but great to feel the history and see the other side of the city life behind the luxury of the casino area. Eat samples of meats and cookies in all the shops, and just a cool vibe overall, but sooooo crowded!"
Very nice walking around area with beautiful architecture and interesting sights.   Eat at a local restaurant like ‚ÄúA Vencadora‚Äù for a great day.
"Walking through the historic centre of Macau was quite refreshing, the architecture is very old school and blend really good with some modern designs. The streets were very clean and the people are very nice. Felt very comfortable and safe walking around the city."
Great area to walk in. Cobbled streets. Would recommend comfortable shoes and wearing sunscreen. Packed with people.
"Very crowded but very cool! Feels like you are in an old European City due to the architecture, Neat area to walk through."
The World Heritage sites in the historic centre are quite spread out over the city and involve lots of walking to see. Great pamphlet with directions and maps from the Information Centre is essential. Take a few days and really appreciate it.
A beautiful area of Macau - the mix of Portuguese architecture with Asian influences is absolutely stunning. Go early to avoid crowds.
"Our first time in Macau and we enjoyed the stroll along the old streets of Macau.  Lots to see, eat, shop.  The place was surprisingly clean, compared to HK.  The black and white cobble stoned walkways seemed intact and original, facade of old building were nice. There is a range of food choices and drinks along the streets.  Bring comfortable walking shoes."
This historic area is bustling with activity and a heavy dose of Portuguese/Chinese history.  Take your time- it can be very crowded and hot (and it poured the day we were there).  Take breaks and don't forget to get samples from the shops!
"The old city centre of Macau is a unique synthesis of Chinese and Portuguese architecture. Strolling around the cobblestoned alleys is an interesting experience. Unfortunately some parts of the city, especially the area between the Ruins of St. Paul's and Largo do Senado, are totally occupied by tour groups and tourist traps selling kitsch souvenirs. To enjoy the beauty of the former Protuguese colony, go for less crowded neighborhoods like St. Lazarus Quarter."
Get away from the tourist hot spots and explore the streets between St Paul‚Äôs and the lighthouse site. The old Portuguese style streets are beautiful. We found some great quiet cafes and restaurants.
"This is the bustling square for a typical European city. Given its Portuguese roots, I am therefore not surprised to find such a place.Definitely worth a walk around. You will find many shops selling knick knacks and food. There are also money changers to cater to those who need to exchange money to eat and shop at this area."
Such a nice atmosphere! Living in Shanghai/ Hong Kong over 3 years in Macau you really don‚Äôt feel you are in China or South East Asia. It is a lovely old city with lots of heritage from Portuguese. This is our 2nd time in Macau & I think I can never get bored of this city.
"A historical site and icon of Macau. Usually full of visitors.  Suggested to visit the Macau Museum and the terrace together, they are nearby. A night visit is also good as not so many people and avoid sun heat in day time."
The historic centre of Macau is well kept and still have the ambience. Mainly Cantonese speaking residents and shop assistants you may find communications patchy. Selling rather simple food but tasty and retail outlets for browsing.
"If you are living around South East Asia, this attraction should not be missed. Walking around this area is like going to a whole new different place. It is not amazingly clean but the preservation of its building architecture, roads and walkways is just perfect to experience the European feeling - with the help of the cold air."
Love all the beautiful architecture of the Portuguese buildings in Macau. We went on a pedicab tour around Macau main island. Well worth experiencing and exploring on one of these! We also went to the other island to a Portuguese town. Stunningly beautiful and the colors were amazing. Most favorite part of Macau. See photos üòÅ
Fascinating blend of cultures and styles. Macau was a Portuguese colony and the influence and style still in evidence. Get off the casino streets and into old Macau for the real flavor of the cite. Historical signage sharing the early history in multiple languages. Nicely done! Very close to the facade of the Jesuit Church established there in the 1600s. Great walking tour. Easy to access from the free casino shuttles.
"Walking around Senado Square and then to the Ruins of St Paul‚Äôs Church brought back memories of our walk on the Camino de Santiago only its a whole lot shorter, roads here are narrow and extremely crowded. Interesting to find a pice of Europe in China! It‚Äôs worth a visit."
"Macau disappointed me somehow, I was reading a little bit about the history of Macau and expected much more than I saw. Make sure you take a walk in the small streets around. I enjoyed to explore the city on this way much more. The main street is full with fancy shops etc. and is crowded, everything looks so posed. Well I hope you are able to enjoy the city more than me."
This is the remaining part of the church. Crowded with people just taking photo. A exhibition hall to show some of items form the old church and history. Don't miss the watch and clock museum around the corner. Actually there was more interesting thing to see in the museum if you like watches and clocks.
Walking on the streets of Historic Centre of Macau takes you back in time and even continent and you feel as if you are walking on the streets of an European city. This part of the town provides good walking/touring experience with many historical sites to visit.
"Due to revenues from casinos Macau managed to transform itself from quite a nasty/dirty place into a seriously picturesque place. The renovations have transformed the place and it's certainly worthwhile strolling around and discovering what the town has to offer in food, architecture, etc. Be mindful of the weather though - it was hot."
"Although we knew bout the Portuguese influence in this peninsula we were not prepared for how much there was. The architecture, food, religion and culture is everywhere interspersed with Chinese elements as well. Take the time to walk around and don‚Äôt forget to look up as well! A lot happens above head level which often gets missed."
Macau is probably one of the biggest surprises when visiting a new place. Get lost on the streets of Macau and discover the people and their beautiful culture. The little stores can hide treasures so don't hesitate and get in various stores food or furniture. This place is a huge inspiration.
"Nice and stunning in the evening. It was no hustle  crowded than in the afternoon, so I could take more picture. I tried some  and drinks juice, Portuguese egg tart, nougat, etc. Delicious but pricey. Ok it is touristic area. A must visit area in Macau. Walking by yourself is enough, you do not need a tour guide."
"My second time in Macau. The old town is very beautiful, a bit crowded but nice. Don‚Äôt miss the street food in the alleys. It‚Äôs especially nice around Christmas with all the lights and trees."
"Spent an enjoyable day walking around the historic area of Macau; highlights included the ruins of St Pauls, Senado Square, the Lou Kau mansion and the Mount Fortress. Great little food and drink outlets abound in the narrow side streets. Area is easily accessed by bus (No. 3 bus) from the Maritime Terminal, arriving there by the red TurboJet from Central Hong Kong.If you want to visit the casinos, they are present on the south of the island, or take another day and another ferry (the Blue one) to the lower island, the Ilhas Islands, where more abound. We didn't, with the historic town enough  for our day. Wear good walking shoes?"
