These ghats on the bank are awesome. River was pretty clean. Had two very pleasant boat rides. The best place would be sitting on Assi ghat.
"The main attraction of benaras. Don't miss the evening and morning g boat tours, the two are very different and has their own beauties to behold"
"No visit to Varanasi is complete without a boat ride; our guide suggested to do it early in the morning to watch the sunrise and it was a good idea.Before 6:00 am, the streets are almost clear; there’s no honking, no hustle, no crowds. The ghats look completelly different seen from the river at this peacefull time. You can hear people chanting quietly, and watch people placing flowers and lit candles offering on the water, or bathing in the river.  Considering the level of pollution and the deep brown color of the river, it’s surprising the waters don’t give off any bad smell. Some say it´s because of its  level of carbon from the cremations.Since there are no buildings on the East side on the Ganges, the sunrise is easily enjoyed from any point.  Boats come in different sizes, both rowboats and motorboats. Our tour guide got us a zithar player that played old mantra music.It was a lovely experience."
"Get yourself a boat cruise, evening for the aarti and a morning cruise. Not expensive by any means, but you must find out reliable guides."
"The river is so big that immediately brings images of humility. No wonder why the people consider it sacred.The aarti ceremonies happening on sunset at the different Ghats are nice to watch and understand the spiritual importance of the river to the people of Varanasi.The boat trip is a must do, ideally right before sunrise... Prepare your camera for this!A tip... They might become a bit insistent on the boat trip, try to do it sharing with more people so you save costs. Also, try to take a man-operated boat, the motor noise will ruin the experience.When visiting the riverside be ready to give donations to people that will paint a blessing in your forehead. There is a saying that says that you should not expect to receive anything if you come with empty hands... Just don't exaggerate the donation, a few rupees id more than enough.This is also an opportunity to learn about respect to others as you see so many people from different branches of the religion coming together into this place... They can all be friends! We can as well!"
"Walk along to see all the Ghats. Take a boat  either motor or rowing boat for the quiet( though you will still hear all the other engins) both for sun set and sun rise, entirely different experiences. Get up at dawn to see the fire ritual and participate in a mass, free yoga class/experience of course with the sunrise as back drop!"
Saw the river from very close range while touring Varanasi City. Parts of the river are being cleaned & maintained with plants on the sides & the river & banks can also be seen from the number of bridges that you pass by
"What a place to visit either day or night.We travelled from our hotel and back by rickshaw.What an experience that was.Pretty scary.We attended the Aarti service at night. Walked along the front and then onto a boat.Motored along the front then gathered along with other boats to watch the ceremony.A wonderful experience.Next morning before sunrise back on a boat again and watched people bathing worshipping and cremations.We the  walked the back streets.Cows everywhere and all so old.Walked back to the bus through the bustling streets full of people stalls,beggars,traffic etc.You have to be here to believe it and take in the smell and atmosphere.Amazing."
"The place and the river has someone extremely spiritual which can not be explained in words . Although you do see bit of filth here and there , banks of ganga in varanasi are connected all along , this makes a long walk along the river possible and its really really heart warming. Boating along the banks and watching ganaga aarti in the evening is must for any tourist.Ghats are well lit now and river is cleaner now but its still work in progress."
"For the Indian people it's a holy river, but I wouldn't swim in it. While on a boat ride I saw places where the water was thick, black and gooey. Still people swim in it, wash their clothes and off course throw human remains in it. Having said that tho you cannot visit Varanasi without seeing the Ganges and at least take a boat ride in it."
"A holy yet hazardous river, how does one come to terms with this? The pollution levels are alarming & there is a distinct stench as one traverses the waters by boat. Why have we done this to ourselves? The world's oldest city with its enchanting, mystical ambience & spiritual splendour must be saved by all of us, collectively. Let us make that promise & support any effort towards that end!"
"The river was in spate during our visit. All the gahta along with their temples, restaurants etc. were totally submenged. Even the Ganga Aarti took place on a rooftop"
It is wonderful vibes place. Viewing the river from far itself could create lovely energy. We went during high tide so missed boating experience. So checkout suitable month to visit Varanasi. I was so blessed to witness sunrise in Varanasi. Something that shouldn’t missed during your stay here. It was beautiful and peaceful moment. Ganga Arthi.... Wow... Amazed with the synchronised arthi performance. The prayer song and music was soothing for my ears. We had wonderful view of the Arthi performance. Overall my visit created blissful experience within me. Will come back Ganga Ma...
"Boat rides along the Ganges well worth doing, morning and night. Used a Viator 3 day trip. JD was a wonderful guide, very knowledgeable and provided insight of the events on the Ganges. Highly recommend this tour."
"Amazing river, so much history and culture.  Was a bit shocked to see dead bodies floating by though!"
Took a non mechanised boat from Assi Ghat and had a super ride through all the Ghats and settling to watch Aarthi. Must do
"The opportunity to witness the ceremonies and experience the crowds and activities that go on concerning this iconic river is a time to be treasured. Lots of people gather to bathe in its waters and pay honour to the gods and their loved ones. Try and enjoy the crowds, the sights, the sounds and smells! Wear a mask if you must to avoid respiratory issues, as the smoke from the ceremonies and fires do linger depending on the breeze. Get on a boat to get a different perspective of the river activities. Things are happening on both shores so look around and enjoy. Try and get to the river shore at sunrise to witness the magnificence of the sun as it slowly lights up the sky. The orange sky at sunrise reflects off the river to add a wonderful backdrop to the activities around the ghats and river shore. Words cannot describe the experience, you got to be there. Sunrise and sunset for sure. Highly recommended."
A serene beauty which has a magnetic effect. Don't feel like leaving this place. River is clean with options of boat ride. Ganga Aarti is a must see event specially which happens during evening hours. A memorable and unforgettable journey with exotic moments.
"This is a must if anywhere near Varanasi.  It’s full on, busy with people, animals, people selling, boat rides and street food.  Take an early morning and evening boat ride for a couple of £.  It’s truly a fab experience not to be missed!"
Having a guide enhanced our boat ride. Getting to understand what is happening made our visit much better. The Ganges was actually much cleaner than what I expected. but I do not think I would be bathing in it like so many others were doing. Amazing to see the rituals and how the Hindu population reveres the river. Certainly a worthwhile visit.
"After so many years of reading stories of and watching documentaries on the Ganga Ji (Ganges River) it was almost surreal to visit. We stayed right on the river and took a small boat out at dawn to watch the activity come to life. It is important for travelers to remember they are guests here in a sacred environment. Taking pictures of the funeral pyres and pilgrims bathing is intrusive. Being able to witness the ebb and flow of life on this important river felt like a privilege. Varanasi is active, busy, congested and crazy but while floating on the Ganges all is peaceful."
Fascinating experience watching the ritual of morning bathing. Take a boat ride to see cremation areas and buildings on the banks of the Ganges.
"My wife and I did an early morning row boat ride along the Ganges River. We walked onto the boat form one of the ghats and then went on water for about 30 minutes.  We saw the density of river buildings, the number of persons bathing in the river seeking purification, the eternal cremation fires and the organised chaos that is Varanasi.The eternal flames with ongoing cremations surrounded by piles of bodies, be it in the ""VIP"" site (as described to us) or the general low cost site are confronting to see. THe noise and smell are overpowering. Currently the city is undergoing massive work in the old part where 300 homes have  been demolished to accommodate a corridor from the temple to the river bank.  They have demolished the homes but left the various private in house temples.  Also there is a large over fly road being constructed which has choked the city of officially3.5million people. I think this is greatly underestimated in terms of population, we sat in a traffic jam for 2.5hrs on one day alone. Given that Nirendra MODI the current Indian PM had Varanasi as his local constituency you can see there is $$$ being spent, happens all over the world!!!!!!It is the dirtiest place we have ever visited, and we have been to India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Morocco and China, Mongolia to name a few.  Not a crticisim just a fact for us. That said we did not get sick at all. We were careful.A trip to India is incomplete without a visit here."
"this river means everything to Hindu's. to me, it was an unbelievable experience to see what's going around here. Feel the saint athmosphere and just walk around with open senses."
We enjoyed this as much if not more that the evening ceremony. We were rowed in a boat along the Ganges and were able to view the morning rituals without feeling that were impacting on them. Watching the sun rise made my morning it was so beautiful - worth the early morning start.
"Walking along the Ghat you see life in such a different way from those who are very religious to those escaping from life. People praying, bathing, eating, begging. Dog and cows everywhere.The evening Aarti goes on for some time. I recommend you see it from above on chairs rather than from the boats.The morning and evening boat rides show a different picture and of course visiting the Cremation area is an experience."
Excellent commentary given By Ravi our Boat rower. Very Interesting to see in person. Varanasi is deeply steeped in History & Cultural Traditional background dating back 1000's of years ago. Seeing is believing.
If in Varanasi you must see the river- it's the lifeblood of the city and really what Varanasi is all about. Take a boat cruise and see the ghats from the water (don't put your body parts in the water though) and maybe watch the Aarti sunrise or sunset ceremony. See the cremations taking place and perhaps have someone tell you the spirituality and significance of the river.
Evening Arthi was amazing.  The disturbing experience was the corruption and pricing getting in. The guide that assisted us was shouted at unneccesarily. This was in conflict with this sacred event that we as tourists came to witness from thousands of kilometres away. It was disrespectful to the event in progress.
"Walking on the border of the Ganga, going from Ghat to an another, is one of the best social experience you can have in Varanasi. Every Ghat is different, with it's communities, stories and activities. You will be mind blown by the colours, the people, and the energy that is very special out there..."
"Ganges river in varanasi is a sight to be seen. Though it's level and flow varies from season to season, it still remains mighty even during low water levels. Considered as a holy river, having a dip in it is a must for Hindus to purify themselves. The river has several ghats alongside each with series of stone steps to facilitate people to reach the river and take the dip. Lots of people also use the boats to travel and do religious activities and see the landscape. Prayers in the form of Aarti is done in the mornings and evenings to the river ganga."
Witnessing the charm of evening Ganga Arti ceremony in a boat is an experience that allures even an atheist. Exploring several ghats in a few hours and witnessing the puja and other religious rituals is something that one must not miss in Varanasi.
"visiting Varanasi and the river was a highlight of our India trip. we walked the entire ghat ""strip"" so didn't feel the need for the boat ride. felt soaked in with the people and river experience. eat at one of the cafes right on the waterfront - they are all vegetarian there so don't waste your time looking for something else. we even brought some of the holy water home - cool souvenir!"
Spectacular is the only word . Don’t miss Ganga aarati. Happens every evening. Boats are available at all the ghats . Can go one round to all the ghats and watch aarati from the boat. ALAKNANDA is the cruise started recently shows 84 ghats. Assi Ghat and Dashashwamedha Ghat aarati is famous
"So glad we experienced with a knowledgeable and thoughtful guide. I learned so much about this holy site but wasn't prepared for the heavily polluted air and water. Having someone who could share the importance and help me focus on more than what I was seeing with my own eyes and Western bias ensured that the experience was meaningful (and not just sad). The evening prayer rituals are heavily commodified but absolutely worth it. For going out on a boat, there was a big difference between morning when birds follow the boats and afternoon when you are swarmed by mosquitoes."
