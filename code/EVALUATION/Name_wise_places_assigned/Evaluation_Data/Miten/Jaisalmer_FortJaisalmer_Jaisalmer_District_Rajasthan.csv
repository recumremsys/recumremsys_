A very well preserved fort. Guides are really good. Best time to visit is in Winters. Went with family and we had a great time.
"Amazing architecture. Take a guide to know more about the fort, it's history and the palace.  It will take around 3-4 hours to visit all the places "
"Went to the fort during day tour of Jaisalmer. It's worth visiting for the art work, grandeur. Would take 2 hours approximately to cover entire fort. "
Had gr8 fun at the fort. Architecture is amazing and dont miss all the 6 Jain Temples they are absolutely value for your time.
I am really upset to see this place. This place was crowded with local people living inside the fort. Not well maintained place. infect fort of Jodhpur is much better and bigger.
"Has 4000 people still living inside this fort. Worth exploring how the people manage life inside in narrow lanes. Cows roam around in small lanes. Two wheelers pass by. In bigger lanes, three wheelers as well. Has restaurants inside. Due to electric cables hanging over the…"
Saw unique past achievements.Good day trip.Well organized and useful guide info Take a guide to enjoy the detail. Not crowded like other venues.Rajasthan's pride
Well worth a visit and the audio guide was the best we have encountered in India so far. Avoid the touts/‘guides’ outside the gate. Entrance on the right up some stairs as you enter the fort. 
"Good for sight seeing, may be one time. Felt it overrated as compared to other forts in Rajasthan like Bikaner Fort, Jodhpur Fort etc.  In comparision to tourists with other forts, my expectation for this was better management.  I had gone 20 years ago and the situation was…"
Enjoyed walking around this fort made of sand and still occupied by families that go back generations. A must see in India.
"This may be one of rare resort which is still inhabited by the local population. Gives one a good idea about the earlier times , lifestyles etc. has many hotels and restaurants inside the fort premises. Will need about 2 hours for a complete tour of the fort."
"A fantastic sight, incredible to live in a haveli inside the fort. It is an adventure. Go there when in India!"
It is an excellent attraction in this small city. The visit to this fort will give engaging moments of 1.5 hrs. Take a good guide who will impart a comprehensive story of every facet. Since we visited during feb the fort occupied with moderate crowd and hotels were also cheaper. We stayed at a decent place which charged us 100 per person only and it can compete with good hotels in terms of cleanliness. It was occupied with foreigners who had been staying there for over a week. Overall it is a good place and deserve a visit.
"We belong to West Bangal & have nostalgia associated with ""Sonar Kella"". Had wonderful tour of the fort, thanks to our learned guide Keshav. Visited many parts, including the ""Ba ri Haveli"", Cannon point, Mukul er Bari etc. Also witnessed traditional miniature painting in action…"
"Well I have never seen a place like this, clearly beacuse this fort has houses where people actually live. They have shops, temples, resturants and everything available in the fort. They are so warm and welcoming. You should definitely visit this place. Try talking to the shop…"
The audio guide for 400 rupees is fully worth it. Don't bother with the local guides who are around the fort.The audio guide took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through at a slow pace. Some sections of the palace were unfortunately closed for maintenance and in some places (18-19 iirc ) the audio guide numbers didn't match what was on the ground. Minor issue though. The tour gives a great overview of the royal life in JaisalmerI wish the audio guide had some more of the local music
Worth a visit as this is the only fort that still has people living in it. You can even find a hotel and stay in. Love the architecture and detailing of the place. Felt a little like Aladdin. Spent about 3-4 hours here
"The experience is tremendous. The fort is alive with markets, temples and residents.  Take a registered guide for 200 rupees, you won’t regret it. The Jain temple and Maharaja’s palace cost extra. If you’re like me you will want to see what’s there, and there’s not too much.…"
Nice Fort and good local market around. Go from back side directly to King and Queen's palace. Hire a guide to know about haunted place around Jaisalmer.
It is very beautiful fort. Within the fort there are temples and shops. Carving was really beautiful
Visited in end Oct. and the best thing was the climate which was not very warm as moving through a stone building can be quite difficult during hot months.  Better choose afternoon hours to visit the fort as most people head toward Sam thus one does not find the fort too…
"Being the only living fort in India, this fort is nothing like seen before. The huge entrance, alleys filled with vehicles, humans, animals and shops, everything you need is here.   The fort shines golden during the day and looks stunning at night. Be careful, you will need to…"
"The walled old  town of Jaisalmer is fairytale like, I thought I was in Aladin’s Agraba. The word fort does no justice to this whole town, one of the few in the world that is fully surrounded by walls, like Carcassonne, Ávila, Dubrovnik or York.  You’ll need a local guide to pinpoint all the temples, palaces and havelis (Indian mansions). The two jainist temples should not be missed: Chandraprabhu and Parsvanath temple. They’re next to each other, so don’t put back your shoes until you visit both. Beautiful carved  latticework in facades, window screens and balconies are  all around. Some  modern buildings copy the traditional architecture, but a guide will tell the difference. Beware of the crazy bikers and tuk tuk drivers. To ad insult to injury, they honk as if they own the narrow alleys and you´re an obstacle.  I really think they should be forbidden and all the walled city should be pedestrian. Also, be careful where you step, because the pavement is irregular and stray dogs and cow’s droppings are everywhere."
"Awesome experience! Its literally the Sonar Kila: the Golden Fort the golden hue is due to the shining sun rays on the yellow sandstone. Built by Rajput Rawal Jaisal in 1156 AD, this massive structure 1500 x 750 feet and 250 feet above the ground level stand above the Jaisalmer skyline. You cannot miss it. The winding path with the 4 gates : Akhand Pol, Suraj Pol, Ganesh Pol, and Hawa Pol all in different directions; the entire path is lined with shops, restaurants, and musicians on the flute or string instruments. A living city within the fort; my guess at least 4000 inhabitants inside.The Chauhata Square with its Raj Palace, its intricate architecture, designs, balconies and cupola, the Marble Throne of the Rawal King, the Rani Mahal (dilapidated) and the Kumar Mahal (dilapidated) along with the canon on the top guarding the Fort from invaders. Also saw huge round boulders on the top which used to be thrown on the invaders in the bygone era. The views of the city from the top is exhilarating including the Gadisar Lake. This is the Rajput Quarter of the Fort. Adjacent to the Chauhata Square is the Shree Chandraprabhuswamiji Temple; an architectural delight with its sandstone shikharas and carved pillars. The Temple Quarter or the Brahmin Quater houses the temples of Shiva, Parvati, Vishnu, Ganesh, the Jain Temples of Rikhabji and Shambhavji all intricately carved along with the houses of the Brahmins and the havelis (Artistically designed) of the rich especially the Vyas Haveli. The path is dotted with shops selling leather bags, shoes, souvenirs and restaurants with Rajasthani and Continental fare. To appreciate the entire fort one needs at least 3 to 4 hours. Come prepared with walking shoes, your camera, comfortable clothing, cap and water. ( It gets pretty hot in the afternoons.)"
"The beautiful  fort can be seen from all over Jaisalmer, it's a living fort with thousands of people living and working within its walls   There are several shops and cafes within the fort and plenty of souvenir shops too. Try to stop off at a roof top cafe and you can see the…"
After visiting a few palces in india Jalsamier Fort leaves one a little disappointed. Climb to the top is littered with pushy merchants and loudly beeping failing to keep safe distance motorbikes and tuktuks. Wiew from the rooftop bar on top makes the experience worth 3 stars. 
"Massive structure, it seems to maintained well in comparison with other Forts of Rajasthan. Guide charges 100 bucks, Audio tour is also available. One could do little shopping inside. Golden stone bowl & Fossil water glass could be bought as souvenir.   Don’t miss the view of…"
Be prepared to get lost ( in time space and history) in this lived in 400 year old   fort. Make sure to visit the Paradise hotel rooftop for a sundowner and spectacular views.Lovely stores and very interesting book stores.  The old stone paved windy passage through the fort…
"Dominant over the town and magnificent, this 12th century fort has been the view from my window for 4 days.Up close it’s polluted by motorcycles and tuk tuks and crowded. Tourist shops on every corner selling mostly the same ‘junk’.Shame you can’t walk along the walls like at Nagur.The streets of havelis and the Jain temples are the reason to enter the walls.I believe UNESCO are now involved. Let’s hope they can save it from the water damage from the leaking pipes and drains which are throughout."
"This Palace and the surroundings are difficult to describe ! Just amazing !!  You must be there to have a look of 400 years of history.  The people who live inside ! should be more careful and keep this fort cleaner.  That means  ""Respect"" of this historical place. Get rid of…"
"Around 5000 families still residing inside. Entrance to Fort is free but for visiting King's n Queen Palace, there is a fee Rs 100. Do go deep inside the Fort to see beautiful Jain Temples of 12th century. View from Fort is very beautiful. "
Take the audio tour - allow 2-3hrs to do. Great place to visit. Interesting antiques and history and great views
"Fort for tourists opens after 9 am. Instead of paying for private guides at the Fort, visit a Government office near by Fort who will provide you with the guide. Don't trust anyone here everyone will try to fool you here."
"Had an amazing experience, loved the sunset and the view from the top. It's a must see and must experience thing to do when in Jaisalmer. This fort has people living inside the fort, which is quite a fascinating thing.  Plan for 4-5 hours and have a great time. Lots of good…"
"Cleaniness is not as supposed to be inside the fort. Full of market. Remaining of Satyajit Roy’s film “Sonar Qella” not preserved properly. I would like to request from this forum for building a “ statue” of Shri Satyajit Roy , that can be a visiting place, as the local people…"
