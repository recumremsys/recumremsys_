"Great drive.  Plan to get started early in the day.  Bring snacks and drinks and a camera.  Lots to see.  The County Road Side Rest Stops are a good bet if you need to stretch your legs or use the rest room.  Water falls, places to take a swim, great views, and some crazy blind curves (I was driving and it was a bit scary at times).  Well worth the drive."
Wonderful drive with many wonderful hikes and sites. Fill your tank with gas and take a waterbottle. Many advise you to pack a lunch......I would advise you to take some snacks but there are some incredible places for for local food!Recommend the GyPSy guide to Hana app for narration!!!
"What a chance of a lifetime. Empty roads, incredible  hiking, and nature above all expectations. Get up early and enjoy this beautiful and sometimes hair-raising drive through the most spectacular country without traffic. Don’t miss road to Hanna!"
A wonderful drive around the Central to far Eastern side of Maui. Set aside 6-7 hours with only a few stops. If you like hiking and exploring +2 hours. Plenty of picturesque waterfalls roadside. Don’t be intimidated by the “1 lane bridges” there is a flow and etiquette that is easy. Note how the environment changes from near desert to lush tropical due to the effect of Haleakala
"Nice drive. You have to dedicate all day for this trip. You have to start pretty early in the morning like 8am or before. We picked Shaka App that you can download for iPhone(o Android). This is $12 or $10 depending on type of route you are taking. We took the full loop (alternate is you go to hana and come back to airport type). Gives you all the narrative and with location enabled, it tells you where to stop and brief description. Plays some Hawaiian music on the way. There are number of waterfalls on the way. Pick and choose. You do not need to stop at all the places. There is Bamboo trails. Big banyan tree under a small cave hole, But the beauty was the Waianapana state park. Do not miss this. Very scenic. Keep food handy. There are few food trucks on the way and very few restaurants before you touch Hana. At Hana we ordered food in food truck. Took us a good hour before we left. There is Black Sand beach and Red sand beach on the way. They are good places to stop.  If you take full tour around  - There is a small segment which is unpaved road. It says rental cars are not covered. This means if you get into an accident, insurance is not covered and you may end up paying for all the cost. Beware of that. In all it is an excellent trip and day worth spent"
"Such a beautiful day. Make sure you down load Shaka tours before you go. It is a app that will guide you along your journey to Hana with great places to stop and hike, swim, eat and helps monitor your time which is important on the highway. It is windy but well worth it!"
"Had an amazing Hana adventure. Beautiful waterfalls, awesome scenery. The black sand beach and blow hole are spectacular."
"Start at 10 AM or before. Listen to the APP that uses GPS to guide you. Stop at every waterfall and botanical garden. Enjoy great food along the roadside and the sleepy village of Hana. End up at the Sacred Pools by 4 and then take a direct, but curvy, road back so you're out of the beauty by dark."
Expected to see more when we reached Hana. Like a beach or some shops. Scenery and waterfalls were beautiful but took to much time to really see anything special.
Be patient... it's worth doing once.  Drop dead gorgeous views and gives you the feeling of old Hawaii... impatient locals--they are easy to spot and let them go by...  take your time and you'll have a great story when you're done !
"Beautiful scenery- waterfalls,  beaches, small towns but a long, long day.  Took excursion with informative, nice driver.  Difficult if you don’t have good mobility.  Watered to swim in waterfall pools but not recommended that day due to water conditions.  Glad I went but will not repeat due to total time spent."
It's the journey not the destination kind of drive. Download on of the app guides and take it slow. Plenty to see and do as you drive the Road to Hana. Lots of waterfalls to see on the drive and a black sand beach which can't be missed. There are several roadside stands to try and don't forget to go pass Hana to Kipahulu to see the bamboo forest and the Oheo pools.
"Beautiful windy drive with constant waterfalls and lush forests! So many stops to make along the way, so don't be in a hurry. This road gets very crowded with tourists so go early and even better to spend a night or two in Hana. Don't miss out of the Pipiwai Trail to Waimolou Falls, past Hana, it is worth it!"
"Start your day early. My husband and I hit the road at 6 am, had water, snacks, and a full tank of gas. You can do one of the prepaid tours but I think it's better if you have your own rental. There are so many nice places to stop by and see and it's best to go at your own pace. I highly suggest to rent a jeep. The roads are rough on some parts. This is an all day thing. Involves as much activity as you want because you stop where you want to. Again, only if you do it at your pace. If you do the group outing to Hana you are on their schedule."
Booked this tour as a relaxing way to do the road to Hana. Travis was our guide and was a great driver and commentator. He even sang and played the ukulele at the church. This is an excellent way to see a lot and leave the driving to someone else.Breakfast was a little sparse but the lunch was very good. Highly recommended.
"Go early, to avoid traffic. Take your time as there are lots of corners and curves!! Also, it is important to note that many of the so called ""attractions and hikes"" while they may be seen as an interesting place to visit or hike to are actually on private property and should be respected as such."
"Went to Hana and had a lovely drive. The road is windy but folks are really good about watching who is coming and who is going by. No silly driving, just a lot of winds and oh the beautiful waterfalls. We were there durning the RAINY part of the day, the next day they had flash floods. I have never seen it rain so hard, and the waves at the Taro turnout were so spectacular and awe inspiring. Trip just took us to Hana Town as the weather was not good enough for us to try the hike to the pools, but it was well worth going to see the beauty of the area."
"Great drive for those who Enjoy endless driving challenges and lush, jungle scenery with occ. waterfalls and peaks at ocean.  Take a Full day, turn your watch/clock off, b/c you can't do anything about it as the road and traffic determine the pace.  Very enjoyable for those of us liking such things:  be ready to stop on a dime, pullover, occasionally back up to let someone through tight spots, etc.BUT:  Fear of Heights?...Don't go!  Fear of drop-offs without guardrails?  Don't go.  Can't back up easily in narrow place without guardrails and major dropoffs without a road shoulder?  Don't go.  ANYone prone to being even a Little Car Sick in your car?  Don't go, b/c guaranteed you/they will be!  Not even in a tour vehicle.  Back to all others, go in a heart beat!!We advise it's best to bring snacks or picnic food and sodas, although there are a fair number of snack shacks along the way.  Also bring swimiming suits and towels, so you have the option of dipping in a pool of water below a waterfall, especially if you have never done that in your life."
"Don't do a purchased tour...rent a car, Jeep or convertible and enjoy the ride and sights.  Allow plenty of time to stop and enjoy along the way.  First time we did this was 3 1/2 years ago stopped at the black sand beach at Waianapanapa State Park then turned back.  This time we stayed overnight in Hana then ventured all the way around.  While there are great sites just past Hana and in Haleakala National Park there isn't any need to stay in Hana or go all the way around.  If/when I do this again I'd get an early start and turn back after Ohe'o Gulch.  Try to do everything during daylight as the drive is adventurous."
The road to Hana is definitely an interesting ride. It will bring you through a lot to twist and turns. Plan on a full day if you aren’t staying in Hana for the  night. Take it easy and enjoy the drive. Do be careful as some locals like to fly around corners. There are great places along the way to see waterfalls and the garden of Eden. Don’t miss the roadside food too!
"Its about the journey, more than the destination itself. A must do when in Maui. Enjoy all the stops you take in between. Be respectful to the other drivers on the road, and drive within speed limits and you should be fine on the road. My personal favorites were Waianapapa State Park, Pipiwai trail and Aunty Sandy's banana bread."
This is a beautiful day trip to Hana. Remember to bring your camera! So many photo opportunities along the way.
"Ok so you read lots but we just did this: first download the app for a virtual tour “Shaka guide”.   For $16.99 it narrated there and back with precision. If it says to skip something, do it.   The driving is intense.  If you are a bad drive, take a tour.  It is stressful. Leave by 0730. There are lots of food options you dont need to pack a lunch. GreAt fruit stands along the way.  Best tropical fruit I’ve ever enjoyed.  Honour system is how you pay.  Bring towels and gravol and shoes if you are unsteady.   Black sand beach can be dicey.  We spent the most time there.  Truly stunning views. Pink sand beach was disappointing but take 5 min to say you’ve been.  All the waterfalls were nice.  We were going to go to the 7 pools but no one mentioned to bring our receipt from when we went to see the Haleakala crater which was $30.  That payment would get us in within 3 days to see the pools with no charge. FYI you cannot swim in the pools.   Return before dark, let the locals pass they drive a whole lot faster   All in all a 10 hour day."
"Don’t listen to all the reviews about the driving. If you can make it through McDonald’s drive-through you can turn a corner on a winding highway, it’s not that dramatic.  Yes you need to slow down to about 10mph around some tight turns. Yes there’s like 60 one lane bridges. But so what if there’s a car on the other side one person goes first and then the other.  Average speed is probably like 30mph.  BUT it is NOT about getting to Hana!!!  The trip is all about the journey NOT the destination!!!I would definitely recommend paying $12 for this app “Shaka Maui” it has a self-guided tour and recommend places to stop and trails to do along the way. You must download it before you go because there is no cell service for most of the way.  The app does work the whole time because it plays off of your GPS location. It does help to keep the trip interesting because it has nearly constant narration of history and facts about Hawaii. The highlight of the journey is actually at near the end that the app guides you to see a red sand beach.  Do it! But be safe and don’t die."
"Waste of time, to see a small water fall on route and not much in Hana. Takes one way about 3 hours. You are averaging about 15 to 25 miles per hour. You need to cross over 50 small single lane bridges. A thousand hair pin turns and constant winding road. Drive mostly via a dense forest."
"We rented our own car and drove the road to Hana. You can tune your radio station to listen to a tour if you start at the proper time. Unfortunately there is NO CELL PHONE SERVICE most of the trip. This gave me anxiety just because of the winding narrow road we travelled. Do not stop at every stop or you will not make it to every attraction before the sun goes down. We loved the botanical gardens, red sand beach, black sand beach, and the large waterfalls. After we reached the tide pools, we hike up the mountain and by the time we got back down it was pitch black. So just be careful to manage you time. The drive home in the dark is a little terrifying, especially with no cell service! This is an all day awesome fun tour filled with beautiful views and adventure! Also it’s free !"
Phenomenal.  Our tour guide Austin was the best.  No need to drive it yourself.  Use this service.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!
"We took our drive Christmas Eve. My recommendation before starting out is plan your stops accordingly and your vehicle. We opted out of the tour excursions and drove ourselves. Get a convertible if possible. We rented a small VW Beetle Convertible turbo for the week which made the experience like nothing else. There's nothing like driving along the coast and the jungle with the top down. We arrived in Paia around 7am and had a nice breakfast at a small coffee place called Paia Bay Coffee Bar, very chill and relax vibe. We got the everything egg, cheese bacon, avocado bagel. Super good and the fresh orange juice. A great jumpstart to the upcoming drive. As we drove, we passed the first few recommended stops such as mile 2 Twin Falls. Even that early their were already a line of cars. Our first stop was Garden of Eden at mile marker 10. It was a nice stop, had a handful of lookouts and beautiful scenery and gardens. We spent aprrox 30 minutes here. Our next stop was at Mile marker 22 Puaa Ka Wayside. There werent very many cars here so the quick hike to the pool and waterfall was nice and easy. We then stopped at mile maker 29 the marketplace. It was a good place to stretch our legs and grab some fresh fruit smoothies as well as some banana bread. From the market place to Hana was about another 15 min drive where we stopped in Hana where if you follow the signs to the beach they have a black sand beach which was pretty cool. We then made our way to Haleakala National Park which was a little after 11am when we arrived. Had a quick lunch with some sandwiches we packed and the banana bread we purchased earlier. We then made our way on the Pipiwai Trail to Waimoku Falls. My wife is not a hiker and wanted to turn back numerous times, but the hike to the falls was well worth it. there was a warning sign at the falls, but use your best judgement. Lets just say we got some incredible pictures right underneath the falls. Awesome and amazing. By the time we made it back to the parking lot it was only a little after 3pm and as we were leaving a lot of tour buses were on their way in. So we beat that crowd. On our way back we stopped at a cute little restaurant/stand by mile marker 32 or 31, called Hana Farms. This was the perfect spot to stop and grab a late lunch. The tacos were on point, the banana bread was super moist and delish. Make sure to grab some for the road. We then made our stops at the different other falls such as Upper Waikani falls - marker 19 and our last stop was at Twin falls, marker 2. There were only 2 other cars there, so it was nice by ourselves. Total trip from Paia back to Paia was about 10 hrs. We were always ahead of the large crowds it seemed so we had a lot of the smaller stops to ourselves. So it was definitely worth it. If you are going to Maui, this is a must, but be prepared to spend a whole day on this trip."
"I used the Shaka Guide app interactive and narrated. We rented a Jeep and drove the entire road around, skinny and a slow go but lots of fun. Black Sand and Red Sand beach where the highlights for us. We where on the road for 10 hrs and stopped at 10 sites along the way so start early AM. Have fun"
"Rained a little the day before and clear the day we drove so we were blessed with majestic waterfalls. The app my son downloaded was the best local guide. We stopped at multiple waterfalls and waded in them. Take bathing suits, towels and a pair of old walking shoes. Also start super early like 5am! Or book a night's stay in Hana, it's TOTALLY worth it!  Take snacks but also stop to eat at the vegan icecream stand because that coconut milk icecream is soooooo good. Finally stop at the roadside food stands a little before you get to Hana. Don't forget to take dramamine if you get carsick/seasick. Oh and don't forget to just put your phones/cameras down and take in the moments."
"Went to visit for the first time. The locals have an attitude that tourists should not visit. Definitely an eye opening experience. The economy depends on tourism yet the residents want to pick and choose where they feel tourists shouldn't be able to visit. If you're spending money in bars and restaurants, its all good. If you're travelling the road to Hana, it's a whole different story. Florida native here and we don't descrimate against people visiting the beaches from other places."
"This drive is very beautiful, even with the tight curves and traffic. Prepare to take a long time but it is so worth the ride. Stop along the way to enjoy the different sights."
"Get the Gypsy app. driving tour guide ($10) before you decide to take the 52 mile road to Hana. It's a complete description mile by mile of what the Road to Hana has to offer. After you get the app. read through your rental agreement because some parts of the road are not covered by most rental agreement. I suggest you rent a small car because the road gets narrow with blind spots, hair pin turns, one car bridges and no guard rail cliff driving. Narrow roads and tour buses don't mix, somebodys  going to have to back up. Make sure you use your horn on blind spots around rock walls. Fill your vehicle with gas, it's a 12 hour ride going out to Hana and back to Wailea. Along the way you'll see Wailua Falls, the Enchanted Gardens, Seven Sacred Pools and  Wai'anapanapa black sand beach to name a few highlights. Seeing the Seven Sacred Pools will cost you $25 dollars because it is part of Haleakala National Park. There is no fee to travel on the Road to Hana. Ohea Gukch is also part of Haleakala National Park and thus the $25 fee. Places to eat include: Coconut Glen's or any number of food stands along the way. Make sure you carry cash. There are numerous water falls, hiking trails and lookouts. Make sure that when you stop you get your vehicle completely off the road. I experienced a lot of road rage, tailgating, and honking. A last tip would be to carry a paper map or make sure your vehicle has a GPS system. Cell phone reception is unreliable and in places non-existent. Your reward will be incredible views, photo opportunities if the weather permits, and an up close experience with the fauna and flora of Maui."
"This is a great way to view scenery along the coast, see waterfalls and wonder how people drive this road of many bends. Remember it goes to Hana and then you have to come back the same way. It will take you all day, but is worth it."
Lovely scenery but if you only have a few days in Maui then don't spend an entire day driving the Road to Hana. If you have a week in Maui then 1 day would be worth it. The drive as many state is precarious. Take rest stops often and pay attention to the road.
