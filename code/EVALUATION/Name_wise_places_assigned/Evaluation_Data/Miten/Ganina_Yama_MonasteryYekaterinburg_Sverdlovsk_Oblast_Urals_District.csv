"1 of the main reason for visiting Yekaterinburg was to visit this site and for a bit of a Pilgrimage of the Romanov history. It certainly is a beautiful setting for this collection of Monasteries, but such a horrible way for a Royal family to be assassinated and their bodies just disposed of. It does seem like a bit of a theme park because of how new all of the buildings are. It was lightly snowing the day we visited, and they still had barricades around the site of the old mineshaft where the dismembered bodies were thrown down. Take your time to slowly wander through this site and remember the significance of why this place exists. Visit the museum in the basement of 1 of the buildings. Do your research before visiting here and you will certainly feel the significance of this site."
Been here before and it looks like it increase in size with churches for each of the Tsar family members. A place to visist if you are in Yekaterinburg
Expecting a place that pays deep respect to the events that happened. We were disappointed by cheaply and newly built wooden churches. The spiritual element is not really there as it seems like it was just built a couple of years ago with little care to detail.The outside bathrooms are an experience... Try to avoid them if you can!
"The monastery/churches are located in middle of a tall pine wood. The place is unbelievably beautiful, specially if it is rainy (despite its inconveniences). But it is not a common touristic place to go. Go if you feel you are spiritually motivated to do it. It is a place of reflexion, on what happened there, on the way the royal family was murdered, on the changes it brought to the country, etc. It is also out of this world if you happen to arrive at the time of one service, in some of the little churches. The chants, the smell of what they burn, is deeply moving."
"This is a very significant site in Russian history and is certainly worth a visit for that reason. According to the “official” version of history, this is where the bodies of the Romanovs were brought and thrown down a disused mineshaft. A more recent version claims that their bodies were burnt here but were then taken elsewhere for burial (see the Memorialto Romanovy in TripAdvisor). Anyway, this site is very significant and you will see many people coming here to pay homage to the Romanovs and to the various icons that are here. The actual monastery looks a bit like a theme park which is unfortunate in my view. If you are interested in the Romanovs and their demise, this is a must see location. Women must wear a headscarf and skirt. Men must not wear shorts (or they will have to put a skirt on to cover their legs.)"
"If you have an interest in history and in particular the end of the 300 year Romanov dynasty then this will certainly be of interest.Ganina Yama is the site where the Tsar Nicholas II, his wife and 5 children's bodies were brought to be burned, buried, basically hidden from sympathisers. It is about 30km to the north of Ekaterinburg.It is all relatively new. When the Communist regime finished in 1992 there was nothing here. Now the Orthodox Church has built a monastery and enshrined it as a respectful, beautiful place in memory of the Tsar and his family.Tips - you can get a tour from Ekaterinburg that will cost about 600 roubles (not extortionate) BUT you can catch the Metro to машиностроителей station (it is the 3rd to last heading north on the green line) for the cost of 43 Roubles each (about 50p). If you turn left out of the Metro you will see a bus station (where buses turn round so it is not that small but it is very basic). The buses run about every 2 hours (there is one at about 11:23). You need bus number 223 and it costs 82 Roubles (approximately £1). There is a timetable posted on the window of the small enquiry office at the bus station or you could Google it for different times. Roughly an interesting hour later you will arrive at Ganina Yama, entrance to the monastery is free. My partner and I spent 2 hours there as it is not a huge place. We caught the return bus at 14:48, check the timetable as you alight the bus!Overall this is a beautiful and serene location that has a mark in history. I recommend seeing it as follow up to Church of the Spilt Blood (the church that has been built on the site of Ipatiev House where the Bolsheviks actually murdered Tsar Nicholas II and his family). Enjoy!"
"We felt we had to go whilst we were in Yekaterinburg, and we're happy that we went. However, be aware that this is a working monastery and not a tourist attraction! It is obviously a very holy place for Russian Orthodox Christians and we felt out of place walking around taking pictures. It is an interesting place in a very pretty setting, but we don't feel like we need to go back. P.S. Make sure to go to the toilet before you come visit - the previous comments tell no lies!"
"Took the local train out from Yekaterinburg to the station nearest the monastery, about 3 kilometers away. There are buses that run from the station, but we ended up walking after a helpful local pointed out the direction (there are no signs). Takes around two hours or so to go in to the different churches and cathedrals (there are about 7 in the monastery complex). There are few signs and none in English, so you should have a good sense of the history of the site before going. Overall, a very peaceful place in the middle of the woods, which contrasts with its gruesome history. There is a cafe and small store that sells food (soups, pies, salads) and souvenirs.There are several tours and tour guides that arrange transport to and from the monastery, which I would recommend if you don't speak Russian. We caught the local bus back from the monastery grounds to Yekaterinburg's city center, but had to wait for about an hour and a half for it to show up."
"After the women in our tour group put on maroon skirts, we wandered through the rainy, serene monastery honoring the place where the Romanovs' bodies were thrown into a mine shaft, now considered holy ground-- although Romanov descendants doubt the DNA evidence. It is an interesting place, with monks moving quietly along the paths. Beware the bathrooms."
"Went out here on a Sunday so there were a lot of people there.  We found a web site called bears with bailalaikas that gave us the bus times to get there.  But when I asked our hotel receptionist about the bus she looked askance and suggested a taxi.  Since it was only 225 roubles we said fine. Weather not very good but the chapels were pretty, there were plenty of toilets and a rather basic cafe. They were having a service in one of the chapels but everyone was milling around and we went in and listened to the chanting/singing.  The photos of the royal family were down in the underneath of the main chapel.  Not having a Russian sim in my phone we asked the hotel receptionist to get a taxi to pick us up two hours later.  The taxi was about 30 minutes late and we thought we were going to need to take the bus back.  But it might have been that the receptionist was using Uber and they didn't have a taxi sign on them.  So you don't know who the taxi is.  Maybe tell the receptionist to tell the Uber driver how to recognize you."
"Built to honour the Romanoff family, the murdered Tsar and Tsarina of Russia and their family. It is widely believed that the military ordered and carried out this murder without the knowledge of the Bolshevik Government who had not wanted the crime of regicicde to be laid at their door. The purpose of the murder was to discredit the revolutionary government and thus make it easier to facilitate a military takeover of government. The family have since been  created 'Saints' by the Russian Orthodox Church."
"Place of historical importance, relaxing way to pass an afternoon. Walk amid the little wooden churches, breath some fresh air, learn about the zar and his family with some guide."
"You must visit this complex if you are in Ekaterinburg. Don't mind the half an hour distance, it is well worth it.Tip: Arrange or book your return taxi upfront as there is no internet over there. I asked a favor from the owner of the cafe outside to call a cab for us"
"You can reach here easily via a car (we booked an Uber ride), but getting out was not as easy, because of the lack of Internet reception in the area. We managed to ask the locals for help, and saw a bus schedule at the notice board near the entrance. So, don't worry if you visit early in the day like us, because there would still be a public bus service to bring you to a metro station at Yekaterinburg City.As what other reviewers might have mentioned, the place looked like a theme park attraction, and we could cover the grounds in probably 20 minutes. Add in probably another 20-30 minutes to look at the gallery exhibits at the basement of the church."
"Went here on a tour and thought it was a bit like Disney land. The site seems to have been hijacked by the church to make money. A few kilometres away is another unassuming place, dependent on which version of events you believe, this is where they found the remains of the Romanovs now in St Petersburg."
