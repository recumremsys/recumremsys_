"The Hawa Mahal or Palace of the Winds is a landmark building of Jaipur. Not only the facade  have a tour of the inside and get a great view of the Walled cimty. You cant miss it. Great shopping around the area...from coloured stones to Razai and other handicraft items. See the colorful flower sellers around Badi Chopar,shop for the famous Leheria sarees and turbans and lots more ."
"Hawa Mahal is truly the face and the icon of Jaipur. Situated amidst the hustle bustle of the market, this attraction can be enjoyed from the front and visited at the back side as well by paying an entry fee of 50 Rs per Indian tourists. The hawa mahal has around 5 floors to…"
"Situated at Pink City of Jaipur, Hawa Mahal was built in 1799. It has approximately 955 windows on the outside walls. The honeycomb shaped and beautifully carved windows allow breeze to blow through the palace and makes it a perfect summer palace.   Exterior is richly decorated,…"
"Being one of the main attractions of Jaipur, the place is crowded by tourists. Heavy traffic adds to the frustration. But the place is worth seeing because of its architectural beauty. "
The most beautiful view of this mahal is luckily free. From the road in front of mahal. Rest to visit from in side or not is your choice.
"Name is Hawa Mahal but there is no mahal. How is it a tourist spot, there is nothing to see inside. It is in the middle of a crowded market. Not worth a visit."
Want to see how queens and female relatives of king and his family see the functions of jaipur then go to this place.  it is still looks like someone watching you from the window of this palace.
"Hawa Mahal or the Palace of Wind is located in Jaipur(the pink city), in the Indian state of Rajsthan.   Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was built in 1799…"
Hawa mahal is more than what meets the eye because it’s huge from inside with pretty carvings and tiny little windows everywhere! Try going on a weekday as it can get really crowded.
We strolled to the Hawa Mahal from the Laxmi Mishthan Bhandaar. The Mahal is in the shape of Lord Krishna's crown. It's jharokhas (windows) on its decorated facade. Do note that it's almost impossible to find this place sans people.  We chose not to go inside though.
"I would say that the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur's most distinctive landmark, delicate honeycombed lattice towering 5 stories.  Built in 1799 so that the royal Ladies could view the town/street below.   The entrance is located in the back.    50 rupees for general admission/ about .70…"
This is the most iconic structure of Jaipur and is a must visit place for a photo or two. Mind you it is situated is the middle of the craziest traffic you will ever come across. Hawa Mahal is a five story building in the heart of the city of Jaipur. It has a beehive like…
The iconic image of Jaipur. Even from the outside it is impressive. Looks great in the evening. A great shopping strip as well
"Hard to believe the Palace of the Winds sits on a busy street in Jaipur.  Impressive Structure with amazing beauty.Hawa Mahal is a palace in Jaipur, India. Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur.Worth a visit even if only a short time in front."
Great palace and great to visit. Took an rickshaw from Jantar Mantar to Hawa Mahal.Highly recommended though the location is crowded.
"Iconic facade like structure is truly beautiful to behold. Located on a busy street, makes it unpleasant to stay longer. Beggars, and hawkers won't leave you alone, and don't you dare take a photo of those snake charmers unless you expect to pay... Pity "
Go to the roof top place just in front to capture at night . There is good cafe also here . The lightings make it look marvelous.
The best time to visit is early morning as this place is always packed with tourists. Being on the main road it's packed. The architecture of it was very beautiful and intricate. The inside of the Mahal is nice. Although people say it's not worth going inside but I went inside…
"This is a very busy area of Jaipur, but worth taking the time to find a spot without being run over to admire it. Watch yourselves if you try to have a coffee from the buildings opposite, you will find you pay a lot for the view. I enjoyed a walk around this whole area of the…"
"Went here but palace on a very busy street, we couldn’t go in but was a stunning piece of architecture.  Jaipur is a breath of fresh air after Delhi"
"Visited this and was told by most of locals that it has a better view from outside than really inside, but as a tourist you want to venture into everything and we did the same. Should have listened to locals, it is a great sight to see, click picture and admire the architecture."
"Erected circa 1799 by Sawai Pratap Singh. Very ornate facade. For the ladies of the harem to peer out of! 5 storeys high, one room deep. You can pay to enter (around 180 rupees each) but we went round the street side to photograph."
"What an interesting and historical building. Built for the many wives of the Maharaja, so that they could all look out onto the street, without being seen themselves"
I saw it from outside and it was looking was very beautiful . It is huge and good . Was not having enough time to visit here properly but will surely visit next time when I am in Jaipur
"The balcony is beautiful from both sides. You need to visit inside to see the balcony and get the view the royal ladies had of the festivities from here. There’s also a small collection of statues celebrating music and dance. From the windows you get far vistas of Jaipur too. You can spot the Victory tower, Jantar Mantar and the city palace. When you’re done make sure to go yo the frontside to see the stunning architecture from the street. Going to one of the rooftop cafes is an option."
Hawa Mahal must be one of the signature places when you talk about Jaipur. Do not think that you would ever want to miss Hawa Mahal. The palace is like a Jharoka for the erstwhile ladies of the royal family to see the proceedings on the road. Even now the busy main road with…
Good and one of the must do places in Jaipur. Get a combo ticket which allows access to 6-7 other good sites  A audio guide seemed worth but the information isn't that great but still not bad to get one  There place is maintained well and is definitely worth a visit
"Enjoyed the quirky details of the structure, fantastic view points of the city and the fort. Can be very busy. "
"Just took pictures on the outside building with the Tour Guide as it was already late in the evening but its beautiful and amazing. Lots of local shopping, if you wish on this street on both sides. Do bargain hard."
"This palace of winds palace was built for the royal ladies, a safe harbour.  Intricately designed windows allowed them to watch daily life without being visible to the public.It's basically a tall screen wall built of pink and red sandstone. Unique. Beautifully decorated  facade that resembles a honeycomb.  In my option,  the best view is from the cafe across the street.  If you're not in a rush, bypass  the curio shops and climb the stairs to the cafe (go to the very top).  Be still, and soak in the view.Last tip....be mindful of the best time for pics."
It’s a beautiful palace... but the beauty is only from outside. Make sure you carry a selfie stick for a full photo view. The best time to visit is dusk. Pictures during day and night are totally different.
Beautiful architecture in Jaipur. Perfect for taking photos. Drive by sight. Takes a few minutes to view.
"Visiting “The Palace of Winds"" or “The Palace of Breeze""(built in 1799) is worth it to enjoy unusual artistry with 953 windows with the intention of allowing royal ladies to observe everyday life without being seen. I have not seen such a site before. It was not crowded on our…"
Beware as this place is packed with tourist at all times.  The best time to visit would be early in the morning as the place would be less packed. The place is definitely beautiful but don’t even bother going into the Mahal because it’s empty inside and nothing much to see. The…
