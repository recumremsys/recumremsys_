"Be patient & you will be rewarded by the different types of geysers in the area. The restaurant(on the right) served fabulously cheap soups, very warming in the winter."
Did this on the golden circle It is nice - very busy - defiantly a must Good that it is free but I did feel as with all of these some information about it would be nice. Very limited supplies
"Our first day in Iceland was not a full day.  We landed around noon, ate lunch and then visited places around Reykjanes Peninsula. Gunnuhver Hot Springs was our second stop, following Bridge Between Continents.  It was cool to see! There is a ramp from where you can view everything. Make sure you have a waterproof jacket and be prepared for the smell!I definitely recommend spending some time visiting Reykjanes Peninsula and the unusual sights.  May not be as spectacular as the sights on the South, or photogenic, but they are unusual and worth seeing. In case you are interested, these are the sights we hit on our tour of the Reykjanes Peninsula: Bridge Between Continents, Gunnuhver Hot Springs, Reykjanes Lighthouse, Brimketill Lava Rock, Krísuvíkurberg, Krysuvik geothermal area (Seltún, Kleifarvatn and Grænavatn)."
