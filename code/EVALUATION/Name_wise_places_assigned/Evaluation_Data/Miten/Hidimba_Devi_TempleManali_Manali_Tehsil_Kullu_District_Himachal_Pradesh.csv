It is very peaceful place. Temple is located in center of Manali city & in the forest area. Small entry point, seating area, & small Footpath to Hidimba Temple and last Small temple. Temple made by timber with beautiful art work on wall. It is known as a temple but not feel like temple. During our visit, winter is not come, so we miss the snow fall in Manali. Vehicle are available to visit this place. Food is not available here. No Parking, have to park your vehicle on the road.It was a great experience to visit this Hidimba Temple with friends."

had great darshan. temple is made of wood and located almost on a hill top.do not forget to play with rabbits as one part of your visit to the temple
"This is a small temple located in a picturesque location amidst tall dense tress. You can reach here by road or by walk few kilometers if you are staying near mall road. There are a set of stairs which would take you directly at the temple height. Near the entrance you would seek vendors offering Yak ride and pictures with furry rabbit. During Feb, the place was covered in thick snow. So much so that people were playing snow besides the temple courtyard. Once you enter the temple, there is limited space inside and a small cave like opening where you can see the footprints. Located nearby this temple is the Ghatotkach temple and vendors selling woolen clothes. I did not find any decent place to eat here."
"Beautiful Location of Temple, well maintained and reminds of Mahabharat. We should definitely visit such temples. Has lots of activities which adds fun for kids. We found local people giving ride on YAK, we hardly get to see this animal. Beautiful Rabbits, so fury, kids enjoy taking pics with these little creatures. And is a kind of earning for the local people."
One of few places in Manali which is mandatory to visit. Local temple architecture which is very unique in style. Surrounding forest is also great.
must visit this 500 year old temple if you are in manali. the same old structure of temple made of wood still remain intact. its right in centre of mountain surrounded with pine trees. try fresh Cherry out there. play with bubbly Rabbit and take picture with them
A sixteenth century temple made of wood in a huge forested area. The temple surroundings are clean and calm. Gives peace of mind.
Visited early before the crowds started. Beautiful and clean wooden temple. You can see the Yaks and Angora rabbits there for photos. Many souvenir shops and parking available.
"From the city centre ( The mall)  you can hire an auto and reach Old Manali paying about Rs 200/- and cover Hadimba temple, Club House  (Adventure Sports) and Manu temple in a half day trip. No need to hold the auto as they are easily available all around.  The Temple is surrounded by a picturesque settings of  small hillocks dotted with long deodar trees and an eerie silence. As you know this is the only temple of Hadimba in the whole world and the plain beauty of this simple construction  of black slate stones will definitely  impress you. Yak ride and many other fun activities like Archery, hit-the target etc are available at reasonable prices. Click yourself dressed in local garments available on rent. Enjoy hot snacks like Momos and Siddus ( a local variant of Momo) and see how time flies. We saw Giant Wheels and some other joy-rides also but not sure whether they were permanently installed."
"Good place in city, 30 mins max we can spend here. Goddess durga residing here. Don't forget to get pics with sweet rabbits"
"We went to Hidimba Devi temple walking. It was a good trek of 3-4 kms. Mid the lush green Deodar trees, the streets appear quite picturesque during the day. Needless to say that if you are not physically fit, it might seem streneous effort on your part, however I enjoyed this trek from Mall Road to Hidimba Devi. Entry Ticket: FreeAuto Charges - Rs. 80/- to 100/- from Mall RoadYou will find Yaks and Rabbits there. Take a yak ride if you want, get clicked.Lot of fruit sellers sit by the temple and its a very cozy location to enjoy, offbeat Manali."
"The temple and it's surrounding is very beautiful....very old temple and quite different in style.....One should visit when in Manali....ho early in the morning to avoid traffic on the road and long queue outside temple..While entering the main compound, one can hold rabbit and can take pics.There are some local shops to buy from. Do not buy KESAR or SILAJIT...Quite nearer to Mall RoadIdeally visit to Manu Mandir and Club House can be combined with Hidimba Temple"
The location of this temple is stunning. Nestled with pinewood trees nearby the place looks stunning when it snows. The temple is also good but it’s a challenge to remove the shoes and visit the temple when it’s cold and snowing.
"The temple is located within the city limits but high er up.One has to climb a long flight of steep stairs to reach the place or one can take a vehicle which reaches the place through a circuitous road. If one climbs up the stairs cut across the hill, then the scenery on both sides is awesome. Surrounded by forests, the sun rays play through the dark green conifers off and on while you can hear the call of monkeys and the chirping of birds while you pant  your way up. There are adequate resting places on the way so that you can take your time to climb up. The stairway starts fro the side of Hotel Rohtang manalsu.The temple generates a quiet, quaint feel.It houses the deity Hidimba who is a revered deity of the locals.The style of the temple made out of wood and stone is also different from other Hindu temples resembling a pagoda style."
"Very old ancient temple with its own rich history. Situated b/w a forest, well maintained even after hundreds of tourists turning up each day to seek Hidimba mata blessings.Queues to get inside can be pretty long someday, from inside it looks like an ancient cave structure.Not to miss if you are in Manali or haven’t been there before, located well in the heart of manali, more closer to Old Manali area."
This is one of the oldest temple in manali. Visited here for first time and i really like the design of temple. It was neat and clean.
"We keep visiting this place. Never get bored. Be it the Temple, the variety of people visiting.The Prasad being distributed. The local ladies carrying Rabbits and requesting us to take photographsThe boys selling saffron. Neaeby Ghatotkach Temple.Not to leave the Museum. Feel like coming again and again"
Ancient temple. Very crowded. Beautiful location. Try and enjoy the local culture by sitting and observing the local people....it's enchanting.
It's a wooden temple. Located at very nice place. Yak Which is at entrance of temple is very nice. Good to go
"Beautiful place but outside this place some uncles have created a gaming zone, where you can waste your money!  Lol by wasting money i meant you could play silly games and you’ll keep performing the tasks to win the prizes. Try your luck we dint won any!"
Awesome template. Go and visit hadimba Temple and it also very good scenes that can wonder everyone.pictures can be taken.some traditional clothes you can wear and take photos.
Temple is in the middle of the groves . Very peaceful and beautiful place. Beautiful architecture you can definitely spend some time and get a good click. Mind your head when you enter the temple  ceiling is really low you might hurt yourself.
It was a beautiful place. We enjoyed the trek. It is situated amidst lush trees. Got peace of mind. There were a lot of people at the temple. The driver Rajveer Singh of Sushant Travels provided us information about the temple. Overall it was very enjoyable. Thank you driver Rajveer Singh and Sushant Travels.
Must visit place. Its calm and beautiful place. Beware of Monkeys.Spent some time around the temple and meet the people around.
"Saw few changes as visited after 25 years. A must place to visit . Maa Hidimba was concert of Bhim & mother of great warrior Ghatotkach @ Mahabharata .you can take pics of your kids with cats , yaks, rabbits ."
