"And explore. It’s difficult to just pick one place and say you must go there. My simple advice, take the whole day to walk around and go to very place, even when they als for entrance fee. From great views over Xiamen to ancient history when this was a commercial outpost, many things to see. Don’t forget the piano museum, even if you are not a music lover the displayed instruments are fabulous."
"A quick reference guide for those who want to travel to Gulangyu Island by ferry.  This is my experience of getting a paper ticket from the ferry pier in person.Getting the ferry ticket for foreigner is not quite straight forward.  There is a ticket office and pier for the local (when I say local, I mean local xiamen residence.  I am a Chinese from Hong Kong and I am considered as a foreigner).  For foreigner, go to the international cruise terminal/ferry pier.  This is a separate location from the local, which is about 2km away.Ticket is 50RMB (luxury, more decorative ferry) round trip.  There is 35RMB basic option but that wasn’t available at the time.  You need your passport or travel document, ticket will have your document number for security check and boarding.  You need to specify the departure time; the return trip is on “go show” basis, using the same ticket, so don’t throw the ticket away until your feet are firmly back on the mainland.Budget time for security check, takes time during peak hours/season.  You need your ID here to match the ID number on your ticket.Once inside the waiting area, look for your boarding gate.  Be at the gate early because seats are very limited.  People shove and push aggressively as soon as the gate is open.  Here you will need your ID again.Walk down the path to the ferry, you will wait for a brief moment.  Again, as soon as they open the second and last gate to the ferry, people shove and push to get to the front to get on.Once on the ferry, the “first floor” is air conditioned.  Second floor is open air; third floor wasn’t open at the time. Ferry time 20 mins.  On the ferry, you can stamp your first “souvenir stamp”, something that you can collect throughout the island.Return journey:You can board at the Nei Cuo Au ferry terminal (the one you got off, on the west side of the island) before 5:xxpm.  OR San Yau Tian Ferry Terminal anytime, 24 hours.  Note the ferry from San Yau Tian ferry terminal will drop you off at the local terminal instead of the international cruise terminal.  The journey from San Yau Tian is only 5 minutes.If you lose your ticket, you need to buy another one which is 18RMB.  Ferry schedule is posted next to the ticketing window.Hope this helps"
"Caught the ferry (seems to be always crowded) to the island where numerous guides will accost you offering their services for between 30-60 yuan. We decided to explore the island ourselves, with the aid of an island map bought from one of the many vendors at the pier area. The Tourist Information Centre was next to useless - no maps, no other information and at the time we dropped by, only manned by 2 staff and not a single tourist inside.  Many different architecture can be seen on the island, on account of the various nationalities that had occupied the island in the past. Good photo opportunities abound, if you can somehow get a shot without all the other tourists constantly milling about. There are numerous attractions on the island to visit, most needing an entrance fee, though you could buy a  5 in 1 day pass for the attractions for 100 yuan.There are many restaurants and stalls selling food, though be prepared to pay premium prices here for exactly the same thing you could get off island. Shops hawking souvenirs and traditional foods abound. The pedestrian only streets can be somewhat narrow and hilly in some parts so a comfortable pair of walking shoes is recommended if you intend to be exploring the island extensively.Overall, not a bad destination for a day trip."
"Beautiful island. Make sure you have 6 to 8 hours to spend there. A long walk is ahead of you. Locals sell water, fruits. There were few restaurants, hotels where you could also get an afternoon tea. We didn't want to eat there, but tea and cold drinks were good. We took a ferry from Xiamen, it took like 20 mins and the same ferry back but that time it was like 5 mins. Depends on the station. We bought round way ticket it was 35¥ per person and the departure time to the island is stated but the return time was totally up to us. We arrived around 12.00 and left around 7.00 pm. Had great time, was absolutely lovely."
"If you only have time to visit one place in Xiamen, this is the place. You will see a lot of old wester style buildings built in 1920s by the wealthy at that time. You can also enjoy local food in the back allies. Walking around will take a day, although you can also take electric shuttle cars.  During pandemic, you need no reservation in advance to visit Gulangyu. But make sure you bring IDs and mask to ride on boat to the island. The roads were not friendly for stroller though."
"You need a guide to explain the history of the building and sites as you walk around the island. After all, it is an UNESCO world cultural heritage site. Getting there by ferry is also part of the fun as you enjoy the sea and skylines of Xiamen. The island is well preserved with many big mansions, small street that have vendors selling local food and snacks. Take time to walk around the island and sample some food. May be drop in for a cup of tea in one of the shops."
"This is a beautiful small island. It is kept very clean. I suggest to visit this on your own rather than a group. Make sure you bring your passport to buy your ferry ticket. Take the 8:50am ferry to go to the island. This ferry can be crowded, but once at the island, the crowd disperses and you can go a different direction. I went there on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded. When you take the ferry back around noon or early afternoon, it is not busy at all. The scenery on the island is beautiful. Definitely check out the Sunlight Rock, which gives you a good view of the island. It's bit of a climb but worth it. You probably won't spend more than 4 or so hours on the island, although you could."
"If you are in Xiamen for leisure, you could not miss this place. It’s an island just a 20mins ferry ride from Xiamen. The 2 ways ferry ticket cost you about RMB35, and the ferry runs every 20 mins. You are required to book the slot during departure but it’s a free and go for your return trip. Having said this, you can walk around in the island without worry when to catching the ferry time. We didn’t spend much time there but we finished walking on the main old street with snacks and local dishes. There are old buildings left from the past colonial e.g from the British or ex USA embassy building. There is also one underwater world or some museum which required you to buy for entry tickets. Generally it is worth to go!"
Not a bad place to visit when you visit Xiamen. Limit numbers of visitors daily. Taking the ferry to the island is kind of chaotic if you are on your own. Take their tram when on island to certain points of interest. Too far to walk especially with kids. Food there are ok. There is a food street where there are many food to choose from n there are some stalls that hv super long q.
First difficulty is trying to get tickets to the island. The ferry terminal is really crowded. Go early so you don't miss the boat! The island itself is full of tourists. Many food options available and souvenir shops aplenty.
"Went there last year under recommendation it wasn’t all words of wisdom ! . For me it was hard work to get there the ferry was like being in a sardine can , packed but I guess not unexpected . The island was probably very nice in years gone by but to me it was very run down and had seen better days . There were many people who were walking around that looked like they were trying to find something of interest but just hadn’t. The only people that seemed to be having a great time and having a lovely day of it were the wedding photo party people ( and on the day we went there were a LOT ) . Sorry to put a downer on it but my feelings on the day"
"If u have been to western countries, there is nothing special about the buildings there.I also hate the way the management makes money from tourists there.  Compared with the fact that i just needed to pay a few rmb to get to the island a few years ago, it's a rip-off to pay 50 rmb for a round trip composed of two 15 min rides on an overcrowded ferry."
"Buy your ticket directly at the pier. Don’t believe the hotels / travel agencies/ taxis even who tell you that these will be sold out! They are trying to sell you your packages, which (if you’re used to independent travelling and hate tourist traps) you’ll regret! We visited on a public holiday and it was fine. At the pier, you’ll need to queue a short while to buy your return ticket, with a fixed boat time for the outwards portion. The sunlight viewing point and piano museum are my top recommends. Incredible collection of beautiful pianos and harpsichords that you can admire, with impromptu performances. From the viewing point you have great views across the island and towards Xiamen. As long as you’re prepared for the crowds, you’ll be fine!"
"This was a charming oasis of calm during our China adventure.  It's very easy to grab a taxi to the International Ferry terminal and get a ticket for 50 cny per person.  Definitely go directly, do not go via any travel agency who tells you that you need to book tickets in advance and pay through the nose for this, there is no need.  There is a Starbucks at the terminal so you can enjoy a black tea latte on the way to the island.It was a hot and hilly, with a lovely beach and gorgeous parks.  This island was formerly Canton (site of former western trade), so there are a number of charming colonial buildings, lovely architecture and terrific views over Xiamen and the island.  Do get the ticket and take the time to climb up to the highest point on the island - Sunlight Rock, it was fantastic!"
"I liked this island, I enjoyed it there. It's small enough to walk around it in a day. We were there for two days and we done so much. First we went on a tour of the island in a tour bus. It took about half an hour to go all the way around. We went to ocean world I don't know who enjoyed it most the children or myself, the best part was walking through the underwater tank, seeing the fish and sharks swimming over your head. Took about 40 minutes in all. Next we went to the food street. It was ok but no western restaurants just McDonald's and KFC both of which we don't eat. The was a papa johns but it was closed down. There was a bar that claimed to serve steak but it was a Very very poor Imitation of it so we left it on our plates. The piano museum was nice to see how pianos changed over the years. The only bad thing I can say was he beaches. We found two out of the way beaches no one around but it was Dirty , broken bottles, rubbish , metal pieces . I even saw what look like a shipwreck on the beach. Not good for children to play.(that why 4 points not 5)  I didn't like the wait for the ferry going there, they packed us into a cage to wait for the ferry it was hot and crowded . Would I come back again yes I would most definitely."
"Ticketing: Try to get your hotel concierge to help you book the tickets so you dont need to queue to purchase it. You cannot book tickets on the day itself online. The 50rmb ticket guarantees a seat, you alight at niecuoer port. The 35rmb ticket allows standing, so seats availability are first come first serve, you alight at sanqiutian port. Tickets on the weekend are hard to grab. We purchased ours on a Sunday, arrived at the international cruise terminal at 1.30pm and managed to get a ticket at 3.30pm.Tip: Print a map of the island with key attractions, find it online. Look at where the hordes of tour groups are going and go another way, usually a small street is better. After alighting at the Port, immediately head off to a street in your mind and ignore Tour guides approaching you. Some are quite sticky. I only managed to brush off one of them after about 5min even after saying no, I just continued walking. Free and easy is more relaxed. Places visited: Zheng Cheng Gong museum, walking along the beach and various small streets and gardens. Didn't purchase any tickets. Spent 2.5 hours. Leaving the island: We left when the sun was setting at around 6pm. After 5pm, all visitors can only leave through sanqiutian port. The crowd was huge. We took around 25min to queue and board. People were squeezing and running up to board the boat. The experience wasn't very pleasant. It might be better to leave mid afternoon or late evening. Overall impression: There are better places to visit in Xiamen and nearby cities like Fujian."
Its a tourist island I can say. Do not suprise that at the Ferry Terminal you can see a lot of local tourist therefore please come early to buy the ticket. Came at 10am and we only can get the 1210pm ferry. You will be approached by the local guide there (100Yuan) to bring you to the tourist destination. But I skipped it cause I prefer privacy. You have to pay for the entrance fees for most of the places. The seafood there was fresh and not so expensive.
"We went before the crowds return, they have  a Starbucks now! Quaint town.  Wear good walking shoes.  I love it there."
"If you did not visit this place, it means you have not visited Xiamen. This is because everything in Xiamen started from here. It is now a historical and cultural centre. To preserve very bit of history and culture here, the government has make this into a pedestarian only island. There is no car, motorcycle, van, etc. So to really enjoy and learn every pieces of history or culture, you must dedicate 2 days. There are homestay and boutique hotel here. Do not rush through the island, indulge yourself in every part of it. This is also my very first ecoerience to visit the piano museum. And the spectacular garden. In the island there are many shops and really authentic shop thst you cannot find in mainland Xiamen. People there are friendly and do try the local delicacy too."
"The island is quite difficult for travellers to get to as you need to ""book"" your tickets which are limited. The island requires lots of energy --- you need to walk a lot, for example walk uphill and downhill. Thus it could be a bit challenge for kids to go. Looks like half of the buildings are out of maintenance and lots of bungalows are abandoned.The way to the Sunlight rock could be challenge for kids and could be very narrow at certain section, but the rock itself provides a spectacular view of the entire island."
"The number of people visiting this island is humongous, and the boat I took to go to Gulangyu was packed with people. I had to endure several minutes of hustling due to the enormous number of people waiting to board the ferry. The climate there is quite humid. The island has a lot of shops, from Tea Shops to Umbrella shops. When walking down the street, I saw many people holding the same umbrella as mine. The island offers cozy restaurants to relax and eat. However the day I went it was raining and the maps built to indicate the location of the city and to indicate where the map was were imprecise. I spent 5 minutes trying to look for the toilets.So overall, good island. Give it a visit!"
"We spent the day on Gulangyu Island and I really enjoyed it. Note that foreigners need to go to a specific terminal to cross to the island. It’s about a 15 minute cruise. It’s probably a good thing to book on line before you go, which we did not, so it took about an hour to process and board. Once on the island, one can walk most places, but there is a LOT to see and plenty of people. It gets really busy in the middle of the day with tour groups, but they do arrive at a different ferry station. Also note that there are no vehicles on the island, except electric golf carts. You can do a trip around the island on one of these, there are 3 stopping points. It’s not really worth it, as you cannot really see that much, better to walk everywhere. They only go around the shoreline.I would suggest that you consider sleeping in the island, so that you can experience the island without all the day visitors. You will need some sort of plan to explore the island, unless you get a guide. It’s also probably worth downloading a map or having one on hand, so that you can find all the spots you want to visit. The island is a warren of lanes and roads. Most enjoyable day. The return ferry is included in the ticket. You do need to pay an entrance fee for some of the places"
"Tickets wise: bring a passport as you’ll need it to buy ferry tickets. It is possible to buy tickets on the spot for CNY50 and up, up to an hour before departure, depending on availability. Coming back is free.GLY is with colonial relics like Building’s and stuff. It is worth spending half a day here just wondering around and getting lost in the Warren of tiny streets. The place is filled with a Chinese kids and couples getting their photos taken, so you won’t feel shy trying to take a photo like them."
Take a short ferry ride to the island. You will see many things which you have NEVER seen before. Island well maintained and clean.
"A huge disappointment from what I remembered 20 years ago. The place now is full of tourist and if you are not a local resident, you will be treated differently for the transportation. You have to either transit at another island (which is a total waste of time) or go some other far away ferry terminal for a direct ride. Expect the worst at the ferry terminals, especial during peak time.Anyway on the island itself, there isn't much to see as well. There are many repeated shops with way too much focus on packing. Every little tourist spot will have to pay extra entry fee.Overall, very disappointed."
"Wear good walking shoes! There is a lot of distance to cover!Plan to spend the whole day, if you can. Too many neat sights and places to visit if you are trying to squeeze it all in a few hours.The admission to Sunlight Rock (litkonggiam) is well worth it. It is a moderately strenuous walk up several flights of stairs, but you are treated to a 360 degree view of Gulangyu and Xiamen that cannot be beat.Take time to enjoy the interesting eats and snacks of the island! The deep fried potato and the grilled octopus legs are delicious!"
"Went to this unique place in a gloomy morning and thus managed to get the last minute ferry tickets. Regardless of the drizzling morning, there were many visitors visiting the island too. We  took about ten minutes to reach the island. Soon we saw the crowded tourist who probably reached there early morning. We took the tram ride to tour the island and stop at the Piano Museum somewhere in the Island. From there we took a walk on the other side of the island that filled with Colonial building with beautiful architecture design which hardly be seen in any other part of Xiamen. The building are well preserved and the surrounding area are clean and well kept. Besides, the island also filled with plants and trees which are well trimmed. Many shops can be found here too, dried seafood, souvenirs, restaurants etc. We found one book shop that tugged in a small lane which gives you a sense of tranquility when shopped inside. The whole Island would have been an ideal home to stay if it’s not “intruded” by  too many Tourists."
"Pretty ironic that a place called ""piano island"" has almost no pianos anywhere. I was imaging I could play pianos all around the island! I spotted one inside a hotel at the top of one hill but as soon as I sat down to play (there was no one around but two hotel workers) I was told to leave since I wasn't a guest at their hotel. The short ferry to get to the island is such a mess and gets pricier every year (was 35/person this year). You're crammed about like cattle which is typical in China. We had some food at a random place, it was overpriced and not good. Great place to walk around for exercise as there are many hills but as with most islands the things there are overpriced. Be prepared to sweat buckets if you go in the summer and the bugs eat you alive! I must've had 50 bug bites on my legs every time I stepped outside despite the bug spray and sunscreen I was covered in."
enjoyed walking freely and safely on the streets of Island even though it is crowded. a lot of old buildings to view
Gulangyu is a respite from the busy city - nice boat ride and nice long or short walks around the island.  walk along the beaches and enjoy the Dutch architecture.  Say hello to some of the western minded older Chinese people and enjoy the local businesses/art work/food etc.  If you come to Xiamen and you don't visit Gulangyu you missed the best thing to do.
"So many treasures on this island! If you love old buildings like me, you are in on a treat! Prepare to stay the whole day. Wonder into small streets and get lost... I have been there twice and still feel I have not explored everything yet...Book the tickets online early if possible or else you are only left with afternoon tickets or buying from touts. If you have time, stay a night in one of the many cool boutique hotels! Some are even like castles!"
A nice place to view heritage buildings and to the different styles of buildings they have on the island! Worth a walk around the place and enjoy the lovely sea breeze! Check out the lovely souvenir stores and the sea produce!
"A must go place if you are interested in the history & local culture. However, be wary of the local personal tour guides. Ask for the actual price before you make any purchase or accept any service."
Could spend a day in visiting the island which is full of western style buildings.  Don't miss Riguang Mountain (the highest point of the island) and the Zheng Chenggong statue.
Quite a few shops selling typical touristy things. Lovely to walk around the island. Look out for the brides (photo) and many dogs. Take comfortable shoes and an umbrella with raincoat!
