Excellent place to visit. Oldest place with lots of good food and drinks. Loved this beautiful place. Maximum shops are old but nature of all shopkeepers are excellent
"Have been visiting for the famous Hazratganj. Over the period many old landmarks have disappeared. But still the place evokes nostalgia of the yore. For the people with taste buds for typical Lucknowi food, the place is a must part of their itinerary."
"A beautiful market in centre of city. Have lost its charm due to metro work bus as the work have started down finalizing it have again started to regain its original old view. There are stores of multiple brands ranging from clothing, fashion to electric apliences, banks and jewellery."
"This used to be Cannaught Place of Lucknow. A very sought after place but for last so many months with the Metro construction work, getting in and out has become very difficult and there is lot of dust everywhere. Getting a taxi is also a challenge due jams that happen frequently because of construction.."
This place always give the eye-catching view .used to visit 3 times a week. Do all shopping from here.
"Nice Wide Roads and shops on both the side, with historical buildings around. Evening chill out place for all"
"Hazratganj, till a decade ago was the heart of Lucknow and was famous for evening strolls called 'Ganjing' but that era has passed and it is no more than a local market now. Infested with the ongoing Metro construction, you are better to avoid this place or else you will be stuck for quite a long time in the traffic."
"Visited Hazratganj in the evening. There is metro work going on there at the moment.The place is a shoppers delight, and is teaming with shops selling clothes, food and anything you can think of. It is the heart of Lucknow and a place full of energy. Did some shopping and came back"
"Place to go shopping of a varied kind, very organised and clean. Lots of eateries, Moti Mahal was a nice beg option. Reminds one of Connaught Place in Delhi in terms of layout"
Hazratganj is not the same anymore. Visiting Lucknow after many decades the 'old charm' of Hazratganj was totally missing. Wish someone who really could understand and appreciate the 'historical' value of Hazratganj was in charge! it would have been nothing less than London Bond Street or New York Times Square if redevelopment was done by merging History with Modernization.
"Famous market in Lucknow city. You get almost everything here in reasonable prices. Clothes, accessories, foot wear, jewellery, utensils, electronics and many other things are sold here. You see small shops, roadside stalls and also branded stores here. Food outlets are also there. Some stores have fixed prices. Most stores allow bargaining. Enjoy a great shopping here."
"Situated at the heart of lucknow, one cannot complete a trip of the city with GANJING! This place is just amazing and has a variety of stores. One can shop from various branded outlets. There are many food restaurants to enjoy food and drinks also you can Rian around, as it has a very nice British feel, which will eventually last very long in your memory. Highly recommended! ‚úåüèª"
"Best place for street shopping, local food, shops, stalls, few big restaurants and buzzing crowd. Old city charms never fade and keep the interest in you alive. Enjoy the place, be prepared for crowd and some local tehzeeb and mizaaj :)"
A lovely vibrant place for shopping and eating. Branded showrooms and ethnic wear with beautiful collection
"Hazratganj is soul of lucknow. If you are coming to lucknow first time then you should always go to hazratganj once. They have all types of showrooms there and near there is a computer market called lalbagh. Hazratganj is very famous for its night life. Very good to go. So if you are in hazratganj then you should go to sahara ganj mall,meena bazaar,gomati nagar, aminabad etc. Because it is in the middle of every place in lucknow. Suppose if you are in Agra and you didn'TV see the Tajmahal....then what is the use of travelling to Agra....same situation is with hazratganj. So , in the end, ""muskuraiye ki aap lucknow mein hain."" Besides it, it is also a favourite destination for bollywood to picturise their films.."
"Lucknow is a NAWABI place and people here are known as NAWABS. It is the Capital of Uttar Pradesh and has always been known for Ganj and Ganjing... Hazartganj is the center of Lucknow and the heartbeat too.Wherever you are in Lucknow and from whichever corner of the world you have visited this place, Ganj has something unique which will not only  attract you but will make you fall in love. Hazartganj has always been a part of lucknow be it 18th century or 2018.An open area for shopping with so many shops is different from what DELHI NCR or other places have to offer.So many variety of street!! Starting  from  Pani Puri to chat. Basket chat to petha paan.From bhelpuri to candy floss you will get it all.There's a church CATHEDRAL in this area which is very famous and old. One must visit this place.The only thing which has changed over the time are all coz of the current development demands.The metro construction going around which are by LMRC. Janpath market is here where one can find chikan suits.So for ganjing with friends family gf or children, for having lunch, breakfast or dinner Or for having street food.. for any reason HAZARTGANJ is the place.And for no reason you can miss it. Do visit this place of you are in Lucknow.Get the LUCKNOWI FEEL :)"
Had great time Ganjing(as people say while roaming around in Hazratganj). Enjoyed tasty items like Aaloo Tikki at Shukla Chat House and Kachouri at Bajpai Kachauri
Believe me visitors hazratganj market is awesome and 10times beautiful that Delhi's cannaught place. More shop with bigger brands. Better market with good quality things. Totally goodüëçüèª
"Hazratganj the High Street of Lucknow represents the culture and easy life style of the Capital of Awadh. Go for a leisurely stroll or Ganjing in the covered verandahs popularly known as Lovers Lane, enjoy chikan shopping in Janpath , chaat at Sharmas Chaat House, followed by Kabab biryani and handi meat in Royal Cafe, Kulfi in Moti Mahal and a delightful paan to refresh you. My favourite hangout   Hazratganj is not just a street but a living magnet."
"Shopped for Lucknowi kurtas. Beautiful embroidery and Mukesh and Gota Patti work. A must have in your wardrobe.Yum paneer Kulchas with Chana, chat with a difference, kulfi and mithai excites ones taste buds. Really good."
"While retaining its grandeur, Hazratganj is in a state of modernization with construction of Metro. mayfair the iconic building is affected and closed. Kwality restaurant is no longer there."
"Good shopping area.  With Metro work on, its a little congested difficult to commute. Had chat at Royal Cafe and bought mithai at Moti Mahal."
Even today the Ganjing i.e. strolling on the road of Hazratganj is world famous. Now Love Lane is no more that happens to be a favorite place for youngsters. All branded Show Rooms are there where one can buy any thing with full confidence.However with Metro work going on these days one may feel little reluctant and inconvinient. Parking is really a problem so dont go by your own Car. better take a cab.
Blended with the old structures new developments like parks and market provide a pleasant experience for short visit. delighful eateries like tunda kebabs are not far away either.
Ada store in Hazrat ganj is the best stop for chikankari wrk . I shopped for wrk as wel as for my family . Thank you for Great experience.
"Superb experience in lucknow , hazratganj have some really good properties . Looking forward to visit again"
Heard a lot about this place. When. Reached was disappointed....Uber and ola taxi times are too long and you don't want to take any other modes of transportation...Area under construction and too crowded...not recommended to visit at this time.
"Loxated in the heart of Lucknow. In 1827, the Nawab Nasiruddin Haider laid the foundation of the Ganj market. Letters on in 1842 the change of name Hazeatganj after after Nawab Amjad Ali Shah who popularly known as ""HAZRAT"". Old filimastan cinema now sahu cinema in Hazeatganj presently closed. Mafair where undian not allowed during british period now closed. Ring theatre presently GPO Lucknow.A coffee house established during first world war.Ancient and oldest market after chowk market. A famous quote morning Banaras evening Hazeatganj is amazing. At present from few month Lucknow Metro work progressed so vary difficult to go Hazeatganj."
"Am writing this from Hazratganj. An excellent place for shopoholic. You will get everything from chikan kari to silk saree to basket chat to Sharma tea. You have everything here. I am too full today after an excellent meal at dastarwana. Am not hungry but want to eat basket chat at royal cafe.The roads are dug up for metro work which may be a little pain. Otherwise it‚Äôs lovely.Visit in the evening as the weather could be harsh in the day.Thanks,Ravi"
"Have been here decdes since. Still the charm of Lucknow, the Ganjing is not all that relaxing and fun. The Metro rail work is a hunderence and Hazratganj is far more crowded than ever, unless one braves in the summer afternoons. Definitely an interesting place for visitors to Lucknow, even if they have experienced the likes of  Bandra in Mumbai or Pondy Bazar in Chennai !!"
"Engulfed with Old structures and the shopping places with lots of eatery specialties doing their business for decades and in the process became popular joints for the evening get togethers, whether a chat joint, or tea place or Moti Mahal the major restaurant popular for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner . Also have many popular clothing shops specially selling the Lucknow Chikan work dresses ready made and material for Men and Women. Very reasonable prices compared to many parts of India."
"amazing bustling place with a lot of shops catering to all kinds of different tastes. Is still the place to go if you wanna get some good food or buy an  authentic lucknowi dress. Any visit to lucknow is incomplete without a strolll down Hazratganj, janpath and halwasia market."
"Ganjing is a favored hobby for many lucknowites but since the metro construction has eclipsed the entire city , some of the ganj charm is fading. Looking forward to the golden days of Ganj again when metro gets completed.Its a great place to shop , eat and explore. Wait until it regains its grandeur after metro completion :)"
From shopping for variety of things to eating variety of items everything is available. Gets very crowded in the evenings.
"It can be easily called the true city center though there could be many competing with it to snatch the title. Located in the center of the city, you can't miss the wide roads and the beautifully designed buildings around with good enough parking, though not enough for the present day, as is with most old cities in India. This is a shopping haven for the mid-up market clients with famous eateries and entertainment hubs. Don't miss the 'chikan' shops the famous Lakhnavi embroidery and the eateries with famous Kulfi and Flooda and what not. A must visit for the visitors to Lucknow."
