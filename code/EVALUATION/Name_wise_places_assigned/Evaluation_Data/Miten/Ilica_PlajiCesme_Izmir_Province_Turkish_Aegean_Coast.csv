"The beach in Ilica is lovely and sandy and the sea is delightfully warm. It is particularly good for families as the  sea is shallow for a long way out. The beach was a little crowded this year, and unfortunately the sea was not as clean as usual.It is expensive to hire a sunbed and umbrella,nut given the heat in August it is absolutely necessary. Be careful - you don;t always notice how hot it is because there is always a refreshing wind."
"In Ilica the beach consists of two parts. First one which is free of charge, but not any bed and umbrella, It's better to go second one - to Sharaton hotel by paying 400 tl. There is a big pool and kids pool. Bed, umbrella, and towels included. There is a restaurant inside. Prices are a bit high but foods were delicious."
"Still lovely weather,  25c in October but the beach is deserted and it's a huge sandy beach with a very gradual slope into the sea which looks safe for kids.  Clean where the hotels and beach cafe and sunbeds are. Seems to be plenty of restaurants near the promenade."
"Fantastic beach. Nice sand. Open to public. Affordable! I highly recommend ""Kucuk Plaj"". Free parking, 10TL ($5US) per person for tanning beds. Free wifi. Friendly service."
"Very nice beach, the water is crystal clear and clean. The beach is sandy, but too bad that the people don't always throw their trash to the bin ! I was expecting the water to be cooler, but thank god it wasn't, on the contrary it was very refreshing and not as cold as I had thought it would be, even in September. Having been to the Black Sea (Ağva) last year in September, Ilica was much warmer, but not as warm as Kalkan or Kaputaş (been there also in September) which is in the Mediterreanean. It was somewhere between both, so quite enjoyable !"
"Lovely sandy beach and beautiful clear water, brilliant for children because it is shallow for at least 50 meters. Get there early as it gets crowded."
"If place is not crowded and wind is decent, it is a great beach. Try to go in week. It is easy to reach from Izmir. So it may be unpleasantly crowded in weekend."
"Great beach, 1,7 km long! Keep in mind that it's constantly windy there. There is a cafe and bed rentals on the very left, that has a wi-fi."
"The most beautiful beach in this area. Walk on the sands, dance with vawes and enjoy your stay in Cesme.."
"Is a lovely beach, very slowly shelving with soft sand and lots of fish!!!  The water is full of thermal areas, so some bits are lovely and warm.  Ilica is a lovely village with some good restaurants."
"Compares well to great beaches other parts of the world. Very calm water, great for swimming. Beautiful view; wasn't crowded when we were there in June (though it apparently gets full later in the summer)."
"We first came to this beach as it was the closest to Alacati, where we were staying, and liked it so much that we didn't bother checking out any other beaches. The beach is sandy, as well as the sea-bed, and the water is beautifully clean and crystal clear at just the right temperature. There is a beach bar with lovely staff that serves hot snacks and an array of drinks at very decent prices. I must add that every single item I tried over a period of two weeks was absolutely delicious. Don't let the understated appearance of Ilica beach put you off as it is a charming little place to relax at a fraction of the hefty entrance fees charged at hotel beach clubs. Well worth a visit."
"From what we could tell staying at the western end of ilica beach there was not much access to a public beach. The nearest we could find was immediately west of the Sheraton hotel. This proved shallow and dirty. Guess they couldn't do much about the depth of beach short of pushing the road back but they could certainly clear away the mounds of rubbish piled up at the side of the steps down to it. Discarded fag butts abounded. Sunbeds cost TL 50 per pair.  We bought drinks from nearby shop. On the positive side, the water was splendidly warm. Perhaps from thermal undersea discharges...yet to look that up but the temperature was definitely warmer than that further south at Alacati Port. Not sure why Ilica beach seems to get so highly rated considering its less than appetizing presentation but maybe reviews are from the users of private beaches linked to their corresponding hotels which are better looked after."
"take a walk to Ilıca Beach, find a spot you enjoy and pay a fair amount for umbrella / beach bed rental, and you're set to enjoy one of the nicest public beaches around Çeşme. The small huts around serve beer to enjoy too!"
"The sea there is clean however it is mostly wavy and shallow. However, it has an amazing color that makes you feel like you're in the Maldives. Avoid going on weekends as it will be extremely crowded and you won't be able to relax"
"Clean white sand. Gets crowded during the weekends. The water is transparent. It does not get deep suddenly, one may need to walk in the sea before swimming. It is surrounded by luxurious single story beach houses."
"Avoid swimming not only on this beach, but on any beach on the coast of Izmir. Because of inadequate capacities, all sewage treatment plants in izmir discharge raw sewage into the sea, mostly during crowded summer months."
Very nice beach with a breathtaking view but too windy.  Renting the chairs and the umbrella is affordable. Can get a little crowded.
One of the best beaches that i have ever seen. Worm water makes you feel like in a warm pool. You can walk 250 meters and the sea is still at your knees. Makes you feel like in a pool.  Very clean and bright
I was surprised by how dirty the beach was. The whole thing is covered in loungers and umbrellas which you have to pay for. I would have assumed the owners of these businesses would have worked to keep the beach tidy and clean to get people to want to come back but it appeared to just be covered in little bits of litter and not really the beach experience I was looking for. Snorkelled a bit but there was next to nothing to see. Would recommend snorkelling further down the coast.
This is a nice beach open to everyone. You dont need to pay to swim here instead of other famous beaches in Cesme. Try not to go there in weekend.
A bit windy as it was the start of autumn. Due to pandemia local administration divided the beach for social distancing. Very cleverly done. Nothing fancy just sea and sand. And walking distance to food. Enjoyed it much
"Very thin sand streches a long way, sandy inside the sea, clear water with one of the best tone of  turquosie. Spend the whole day on golden sand and refresh in cool sea. Crowded in summer,best in September."
"Public beach, sometimes there are vagues, but most of the time is calm. Warm water. You will stay hours in the sea. Avoid going on the weekend. During the week there is less people. Very long beach. Possibility to rent ""chaise-longues"". Don't bring valuable stuff. You are in a public beach. This is the same in all public beaches.Enjoy the sea."
We were there on 1st of April 2015 and it was still too cold for a swim. Am not sure which side of the beach we were but  We were the only there. There were lots of hotels around but it's all closed  and we can see that repairs are ongoing probably in preparation for the summer season. The water was amazing was really compelled to take a dip if not for the cold weather. Really Wish I could return in summer next time...
Live close by and highly recommend this sandy beach on any day but a Sunday or Bayram when it fills up with domestic tourists. The winds can pick up so be aware!
"we spent a whole day here on the beach. clear waters, white sand, and amazing views. we flew from Istanbul to Izmir, took the bus to Cesme, and had the most beautiful over day. Recommended."
"One of the most amazing beaches in the world ever. Beautiful sand, plenty of space. and hot natural underwater springs that warm the cool waters of Cesme. More quiet during the week and can be busy at weekends as it is a publich beach. Renting of umbrella and beach beds is possible. Snack bars are present."
"Ilica is rather long, so yo can pick which section to lie on. There are chaise longues and parasols at decent prices and numerous terraces where you can grab a beer, coffee or whatever you want. It seems to be a favourite of Russian tourists. Getting into the water requires beach shoes, or very insensitive soles..."
"Avoid on Sundays as it will be full of people on a day-trip to Cesme. If you can manage weekdays, you can enjoy much better. Other great beaches in Cesme are Altinkum and Pirlanda (quite close to each other) but their water is usually much colder than Ilıca."
"Went for a swim with my 3 year old son who thoroughly enjoyed the shallow extra clear water.The west end of the beach towards the Sheraton hotel or Cesme has a few restaurants and shops.If you are driving to the beach, parking on the waterfront is scarce so you will probably need to park on a back road and walk down. There are no showering facilities on the beach but it is really clean."
"Went to Cesme last summer with friends.   As we had never been to Turkey before, I did'nt know what to expect.  Cesme is in the northern part of Turkey, away from the more tourist areas down south.  Absolutely beautiful.  Loads to do and see and the most beautiful beaches.  Illica beach is just class.  Beautiful tourquise sea.  Our friends brought us to the most beautiful little village / resort area.  'Alacati.....please, please google on Tripadvisor.  I have never been to a more prettier place, reminded me of Greece a little.  Very, very sophisticated, but still sooooo charming.  Fabulous restaurants and quaint little coffee shops and cafes.  Alacati is famous for its stonework and growing heather.  This adds so much to the whole charm of the area.  Please check out."
"Parking your car might be a bit difficult if you are not willing to pay for it. We went to ilica beach before breakfast and it was nearly deserted . Warm water, no wind, no big waves - amazing!"
"hang out, eat a kumru, have a few beers with chips, grab a few stuffed midye dolmas (stuffed mussels) from the wandering beach vendors, just enjoy the turquoise waters. Swim, walk, try to leave the real world behind. We visit this beach usually before schools go on holidays, so May or October is perfect timing."
