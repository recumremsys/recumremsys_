"This is a very peaceful and serene place in the midst of Darjeeling. Founded by Japanese Buddhists, it has a prayer hall, a monastery and a pagoda on top of the hill. I participated in the prayer, which was a great experience."
Peaceful japanese temple and pagoda. It has a scenic view of city from here. Area is well kept. Might get crowded with vehicles as entry/exit gate is small. Have a decent parking place and one more under construction.
"It's a brilliant work of art in white. One can have a stunning view of Mt. Kanchenjunga from the place. One has to remove shoes before climbing the stairs leading up to the pagoda. Freezing cold floor, view of Kanchenjunga, stupas adorning the place and warm sun rays would make the view perfect. However there's usually traffic leading to the pagoda hence one might have to walk which is pretty tedious as the road is quite steep."
"Perched on a hillside 2km south of the town centre, the gleaming white, 28m-high Peace Pagoda is one of more than 70 pagodas built around the world by the Japanese Buddhist Nipponzan Myohoji organisation. During the drumming puja (prayers) sessions in the neighbouring temple, visitors are offered a hand drum and encouraged to join in the rituals. Getting here involves a pleasant walk along Gandhi and AJC Bose Rds, past the curiosity-inspiring Institute for Astroparticle Physics and Space Science."
Not for hectic visit you have to spend time there. Sitting amidst green cover of trees this place is for relaxation and reuniting with oneself. Very clean and natural. Food basically tea coffee and Maggie are available just outside the institution. A good place to relax.
This is mostly outdoor activity. Darjeeling weather is unpredictable. So be prepared. You donâ€™t need more than 30 mins to see the place unless you cannot find parking at the location.
