"Such an impressive and imposing structure. Really interesting massive stone walls and moat surround the castle. The entry to the castle casts an intriguing tale, with twists, turns and tricks to keep out unwanted invaders. Spot the cross symbol on a roof near castle entry - highly unusual for this period... authentic mystery or contemporary prank? Be prepared to climb steep stairs over 5-7 floors within the castle itself, all in low light. 360 degree view of Himeji from the top makes the climb worthwhile."
Travelled from Kyoto to Himeji to visit this beautiful castle. Certainly well worth it. Huge grounds with well maintained garden. Walked up all the way to top floor. Had a good view of surrounding area. Castle very well kept despite all the history. Note stairs inside castle can be steeped
"Claimed to be the most beautiful castle in Japan, it really is stunningly beautiful on a sunny day with a blue sky background. The inside visit was disappointing: there are very little artefacts and furniture inside, and the inevitable crowds make it all rather fraught as you shuffle round, up steep and slippery wooden stairs into the narrowing floors as you go to the top, then back down again for relief from the confined and crowded spaces. Don't miss the adjacent Kokoen gardens, which are a blaze of colours in the autumn."
"Himeji Castle is located in Hyōgo Prefecture. Not far from Kyoto and Osaka Is the most beautiful castle in Japan and has been ceded as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and next to the castle is a 33,000 square meter wide park.travel:When the train arrives at Sanyo Himeji station . Walk Continue for 15-20 minutes to the outer wall of Himeji Castle. Around the castle area there will be a moat around. From the road, we have to walk across the bridge to get inside the castle."
"Our first view of this amazing castle was while walking down the main avenue from Himeji station. Built high on a hill it is an impressive sight. Unlike most European castles the main keep is finish in white plaster.If you visit the castle be prepared for a lot of steps if you want to go right to the top but in my opinion the climb is worth every step as it takes you through some great displays of life in castle in a by gone era.Well worth a visit, don't miss it!"
Great little town that we really enjoyed! The castle and it’s construction is seriously impressive. White Heron CastleGreat views from up the top! Download a scanning app on to your phone so that you can get a link to some of the displays shown there. There are a few English guides around though we’d forgotten to organise one. We also paid the extra 40 yen to get access to the gardens which are just next door and lovely too see. Can have a meal there if you like but we went to a tea ceremony instead! Don’t miss it! Great sight!
Himeji castle is totally different from Osaka and Nagoya castle. Most parts of the building are from the original material since it builds. go earlier than 17.00 pm since it will close at 18 pm and you need and our to reach the rooftop.Very nice and Must visit!
"Himeji castle is one of Japan premier castles coloured in white which studded on the top of Himeyama hill. Become the largest on most visited castle, It registered as one of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. Surrounding by cherry blossom is adding the beautiful scenery during spring. Next to the castle, we can also enjoying Japanese style garden as well as city zoo. Shopping mall and Handicraft shops are available near by."
"Himeji castle is an original castle so it is worth going out of your way to visit it. Most other castles in major places like Osaka or Hiroshima etc. are all reconstructions. Because Himeji castle is original all the surrounding buildings are gates are intact and the main tower of the castle is much larger than other castle and the interior is all original. The only downside is that because it is one of Japan's major tourist attractions there are huge numbers of visitors and the queue to get up and through the main tower of the castle can be very long, although you can go through parts of the castle on the way. Inside is very busy and it can take a long time to get through. At the top is very busy and it is hard to see out of the windows because there are always people in the way."
"Himeji Castle is the most beautiful castle in Japan that made me curious and visited for second time.  This time I spent almost 3 hours , really enjoying the majestic of Himeji castle.With an entrance ticket of ¥ 1040 including Kokoen Garden, since 9 am I have been at the location to avoid the long queues of visitors.Entering the castle area is required to take off the footwear.The building inside the castle is dominated by old and big woods, both floors, stairs, pillars and gates. There are 6th floors in the castle and through a narrow staircase to each floor to the top. Be careful while climbing the stairs to the top.From the top castle we can see Himeji city stunning view. Like the Kings and royal guards used to watched the surroundings from the top of Himeji Castle."
"The castle is truly impressive. Lots of stairs to climb to go up the main keep, but definetly worth it. Admission price is affordable. There are vending machines on the premises selling beverages so no need to worry on a hot day. Walk around the marked path to get great views of the castle."
Tons of history and ideal for studying a castle. The castle has been maintained well with lots of renovation. Be ready for a lot of walking inside the castle and in the grounds.
"Was here a few years ago and already thought it was a beautiful castle to visit.  Went this time with the sakura in full bloom, it just blew my mind.   Good day trip to spend the day here if you are staying in near by big city."
"It is a castle that can be easily seen once you stepped outisde the JR Himeji Station. It is walkable from there for about 10 minutes (depending on the pacing). But there are also buses running in the city starting from the station. Fee is flat for the first 2 stations (100 yen). The park inside is clean and has 2 attractions. Himeji zoo and the castle itself. Depending on the amount of visitors, long queues could form. You can start on the west gate towers then going to the main keep. The main keep is a 6 storey structure with steep stairs (not advisable for senior or with weak lower body strength), but this is understandable as the authorities wanted to preserved the structures and show its original form as much as possible. The flow tends to slow down once the top most floor is reached due to the amount of tourist and visitors wanted to take the city view of Himeji from the inside of the castle.After the main keep, you can go to the east tower of the castle.There are souveneirs at the base and vending machines. Reminders: - No drinking and eating inside- No toilet in the main keep of the castle- There are also tours done in english - You need to take of your footwear when entering the structures. A plastic bag will be provided for you to carry your footwears."
Himeji castle is worth the day trip for sure. The place is stunning. It has all been renewed and so it feels like walking back in time. It is true is empty inside but that gives a chance to truly see the details. If you like architecture and history it is really great. The walking around the castle is also great with lich opportunity to see the roofing details along the way. Beware no strollers are allowed (you couldn't get them anywhere anyway) so you'll have to carry baby for the duration. Still worth it. The views drom the top are beautiful. The western buildings are also worth taking a look for a better idea of lovong quarters instead of a military building. It wasn't too crowded when I visited so I was really able to steep in the days of yore atmosphere. Not to be missed!
"Didn't originally plan to your the Castle, but so glad we did. Such an impressive fortification sitting high above Himeji. It's steep climb to the top up to the 6th level but there are lots of interesting facts on the how and why It was built. Then head over to the West Bailey, a 300m long attachment housing apartments and a fascinating film of the restoration work that has been carried out."
The castle is really beautiful and is a must see in this part of Japan. Get there early during busy tourist periods as only 15000 are allowed in each day. The castle originated in the 1300's and has been modified many times since. The last major renovation was finished in 2015 and it is now in wonderful condition. The buildings are extensive. If I had a complaint it would be that there are very few artifacts inside any of the buildings. There are numerous information boards however.
"The Castle grounds were lovely in spring, so many great photo spots! The castle itself is beautiful too, and I loved the details and architecture. But inside looked pretty lonely and empty, devoid of any furniture to make it look like how it would have been in the past. This was a pity.Having said that, here's a tip, if you have young kids, go super early, preferably before 10am. Crowds build up later and there will be queues. We went early on a Sunday and though there was already a queue, it was acceptable for us. Wear socks as you would be required to remove your shoes and place them in plastic bags given. There are also many stairs in the castle to climb to go to the upper levels and the stairs are pretty steep. Would have to be careful.After visiting the castle, there was a flea market and a fair just across the street. Not sure if it is a regular feature, but it was lovely."
"The first view of the snowy white castle is when you leave the rail station. The wide boulevard, a straight line from the station to the castle itself, is lined by Ginko trees and fine sculptures - some quite amusing. Don't miss the cast iron enamelled manhole covers with pictures of the town's emblem - white herons. Towards the end of the boulevard the outer fortified city wall comes into sight, then a couple of hundred metres further on, the magnificent castle gardens. Although we were too stingy to pay the 1,000 yen entrance fee we were more than satisfied with our visit. In the park we got talking to a couple of ladies in beautiful traditional kimonos - only to learn that the reason behind our conversation was to persuade us to become Jehova's Witnesses! Parallel to the main boulevard is a kilometre-long shopping arcade with coffee shops and restaurants"
"We have visited quite a few castles in Japan and our verdict is Himeji Castle is the best among all. The walk into the castle itself is scenic with many Cherry trees lining along the road. Given the castle was recently renovated and reopen in 2015, everything was cleaned and well maintain."
"What an experience! Did you know that it’s not a castle but rather a watch tower for the emperor? We were lucky to have a free guided tour by a volunteer. A leisurely 20min stroll from Himeji Shinkansen station, stopping for a bowl of Uson Noodles with Prawn Tempura!! A lot of steep steps to get to the top..so be warned. Get there early to avoid the crowds. Some amazing Insta pics. Can see why this is the most popular of all castles. Please add to your bucket list."
"The city of Himeji is dominated by this stunning castle.  It is called Hakuro--jo, the White Heron Castle, because of its brilliant white exterior and it is thought to resemble a white heron taking flight.  We visited at the time of the cherry blossom and the castle appeared to float on a cloud of pink flowers.We didn't take a tour of the interior of the castle (it's numbered/timed entry to the Main Keep) but the gardens are a delight.  Take a stroll around the back of the castle; it was an oasis of peace and tranquillity under the blossom !!  Or perhaps a boat trip around the moat ?"
"Being a castle wich survived wars and bombings now it is an interesting visit to see the spaces inside. Do not expect the furnishings you saw in Kusorawa's Ran but small exhibitions related to the castle. Beware the stairs climbing up and then down! It's the only castle we visited, as recomended, but a good example as a building and as a whole set of fortifications. You can wander around at ease, if you do not mind the crowds which swarms all around."
Worth the day trip out to Himeji to see this beautiful castle. Was way less crowded than Osaka. And it certainly seemed much larger. There was some sort of AR app that we didn't download. But we saw others enjoying it very much. We felt like we could relax and enjoy this venue without being rushed in and out like many of the venues in Kyoto and Osaka. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting.
"It’s a Long train ride and walk to Himeji Castle from kyoto station but well I can say it’s well worth the trip!Superb architecture, very nice history, plenty of landscape and castle grounds for one to explore and rest. Take your time to scale the steep steps and admire the lush grounds.Personally one of my top 5 activities to do in japan. Just spend 1 day immersing yourself in this wonderful attraction."
"A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Himeji Castle boasts of its epic view around the city. Sitting on top of a montain, you can see the white color from afar. Prepare lots of water and be ready to walk a few hundred meters from the parking lot to the main castle. Be careful tho because stairs are short and very steep. Worth visiting!"
"During our day trip to Himeji, a trip to the castle was a must. A spectacular structure steeped in history and beautifully preserved, we learnt so much. Do note that it’s a steep climb up to the castle and very steep stairs within the castle. It may not be advisable for the elderly or if you families with strollers. Would definitely recommend making a pit stop to the Himeji castle if you are visiting the town. Tip: if you have the time, purchase the ticket to the Koko-en gardens as well."
"I've always wanted to Visit the White Heron Castle as the picture of this castle always adorned the calendars since I was young. Finally my dream came true and it's still the most beautiful castle in Japan. Not that I've visited all, but been to quite a few and this is still the most outstanding one.  So majestic! It's walkable from the Himeji JR Station. Around 20 minutes or so. Just straight down from the JR Station entrance. We took the bus, as we went to the ropeway first before returning to visit the White Heron. Climbed up to the tallest tower, although most of the artifacts are not there but can still admire the architecture and structure of the castle.After visiting the castle, we took a leisurely walk back to our hotel next to the JR station and it was a wonderful walk in the evening. Stopping by at the little shops selling green tea ice-cream and green tea. As we made our way back to the hotel, we got our bearings of where the shopping and food streets are. Sadly I couldn't explore everything as we only had 1 night there.Definitely intend to visit Himeji again!"
"Take a step back in time by visiting this beautiful castle.  It's an easy day trip from Kyoto or Hiroshima on the Shinkansen train.  Train station has a good number of lockers or varying sizes to store your bags while there. (Locker only accept 100 yen coins so make sure you have a few).  Explore the grounds and parks around the buildings, taking in the many photo ops.  The main building is a prime example of medieval Japanese wooden architecture.  Unfortunately, there are no furnishings in the buildings so you'll just have to imagine how beautiful it must have been.  The wooden beams and joints are pretty stunning if you think back in time to when these would have been hand hewn!!! Be advised that the castle is 7 stories high and the wooden staircases between floors are very steep with metal handrails.  Be sure to include the gardens in visit,  this a few extra Yen on your ticket but well worth it."
"This splendid castle, one of only twelve remaining ‘original ‘ castles in Japan is an absolute Must See if you are in Japan.  Easily accessible via Shinkansen and a brief walk, the castle is a delight of architecture and history.  Be sure to walk up to the top Shrine and absolutely do not miss the Shogun’s Gardens, one of the best in Japan.  You’ll definitely put a visit to Himeji as one of the top things you’ll do in Japan."
"take train to Himeji Station. walking distance to castle. about 10-15 mins. pretty straight forward. just ask the locals in case you are in the wrong direction. part of the castle was under reno when i visited in mid Nov 2019. paid entry to the castle which would take u all the way up to the top. however, steps are narrow and steep. ceiling is low at certain areas. becareful."
"Himeji Castle is truly an amazing castle.  Make sure to plan a trip to Himeji for a full or half day (5 hours).  The castle was really gorgeous and magnificent, you can feel the hardwork and dedication of the Japanese people on maintaining and recreating this Gem.   Walking up and down each floors was an amazing experience.  Make sure to also visit the other halls around the castle.  Outside the castle there are also a lot of Locals dressed up as samurai's where you can take a picture with for free.  You can tell they are very proud of their history and legacy.  Himeji is a must visit if you are in Japan."
"The reason we chose to visit Himeji Castle was because we read that it was the best castle to visit. The castle is beautiful, but it is empty. Walking all the way to the top was great experience but there was nothing to see in the castle itself. The grounds were very interesting and we did spend half a day there. Outside the castle itself there were stalls with bonsai trees and beautiful flowers.Walking through himeji was fun and there were a lot of places to shop."
"Is it one of the absolutely ""must see"" attractions in Japan. It's an astonishing structure that makes you realise the power of the Shoguns in the years between 1500-1600."
"Really pleased to have made the day trip from Kyoto to Himeji to see the commanding presence of this Castle.  But like many others, really didn't need to see the inside.  Walking to the castle from the drop off point showed it's grandeur and presence. We enjoyed walking around and then going to the Koko-en gardens.  We felt we had a very good day of sightseeing doing all of this."
