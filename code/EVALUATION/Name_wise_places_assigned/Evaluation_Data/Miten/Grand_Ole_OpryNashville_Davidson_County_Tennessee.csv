Loved the backstage tour & the history of the amazing country artists. Try to get on the original circular wood stage.
Went on a girls trip to Nashville and a trip to the Grand Ole Opry felt like a must do item. I'm not a country music lover so I wasn't sure how I would like it but the tour was great. They shared a lot of information and you could just feel the iconic vibe of the Opry House. If you are on the fence book it next time I will try to see a show there to get that experience as well!
LOVED EVERY MOMENT! I loved being there again. It was so well run up until waiting to get into the venue. Standing on the concrete for over an hour waiting for the over run from the first show to exit was hard on everyone and it was a tad chilly. I recommend going to the first show available and get center located seats so you can see. We were on the end stage left and although they have TVs so we can see it was a bit too far left. I loved seeing everyone I grew up hearing but they only sang 2 old songs and I wanted more hits than new stuff. But I still enjoyed it thoroughly and will be going back for sure!
"This was a very interesting tour. Got to see behind the scenes of the Grand Ole Opry. Our guide was very personable and had great knowledge, her personality was great. Answered all of our tour group questions. If in Nashville and you love the Opry you will find it worth your wild."
we took a tour - worth the money so exciting to be able to hear and see all the rooms where the famous people that sing go.  was interesting about the flood - loved the dolly parton stories and so much history - what a great place.
"You cannot come to Nashville or the Opry without taking this tour.  The introductory film with Garth and Trisha was a gem. Just seeing all of the inductees names on the plaques in the hallway is worth the price of admission.  Learning all about the history, some well-known and some not known outside Nashville was wonderful. Our guide had been there 30 some years and he knew everything and more.  Seeing the themed dressing rooms was fun although I cannot believe when they rebuilt after the flood that they didn't put bathrooms in each dressing room!  Most crazy of all was being able to stand in the circle on stage.  I really didn't feel any of us on the tour were worthy.  We came back for the show that evening which was also so much fun.  The seating in the auditorium is all pew benches which seems appropriate for such a holy place."
"This was our 3rd trip to the Grand Ole Opry and you are always guaranteed a good night out.  It is a wonderful theatre seating just under 5000.  Allocated seating in padded pews which gives a nice nod back to the Ryman.  The line up of each show is different and the acts slowly get announced in the weeks leading up to it.  It is likely if you book a long way in advance you will not know who you are going to see, but the Opry show is all about the experience and is bigger than any one artist.  There are normally 6 or 7 acts on each performance ranging from up and coming artists, legends, and current mega stars.  We recommend booking as far in advance as possible to get a good selection of seats.There is a huge gift shop with a fantastic range of clothing, housewares, memorabilia, Christmas decorations (all year) and music.  The shop is open throughout the day.This show is a must when in Nashville and we cannot wait for visit number 4."
"Having family as a part of Hee Haw naturally made a visit to the Grand Ol Opry a must.  We were taken to stage A where the show was taped which was worth the trip in itself.  We toured the dressing rooms, saw where the guests entered and we're welcomed by Minnie Pearl's fountain. Then we were led out on the stage and had our picture taken ""in the circle."" My husband quietly sang Amazing Grace so he could say he sang on the stage at the Grand Ol Opry.  Well worth it."
"There is no place quite like the Grand Ole Opry! It is no wonder it has been going for 90 years! Been loads of times, and never seen a bad show! An absolute must if you are in Nashville."
The backstage tour was incredible. Loved seeing where the country stars dressed and gathered before the show. Standing in the circle was a true once in a lifetime experience.
"There are few experiences in life like the Grand Ole Opry. We began the day by going to the Ryman Auditorium, which I highly suggest before going to the Opry itself, to better understand the history behind the creation of the iconic Opry. Once we arrived at the Opry, right across the street from Aquarium Restaurant in the Opry Mills shopping plaza, we were greeted by beautifully maintained hedges/trees that were interspersed with little monuments to country music. Before the two story exterior were dividers that either led to the gift shop (which was still open after the show) or the entrance to the Opry itself.Once you enter the Opry you can't help but be impressed with how much thought and care went into the construction of this magnificent structure. The amenities for food or liquor are about what you'd expect at a venue like this, but the barn themed show piece around which the stage is built gives a feeling of being back in the Hee Haw days of TV. The massive signs to either side of the stage with ON AIR warnings take you back a bit too...it's strange sitting in the middle of a live music/comedy performance realizing millions of people around the world are sitting by their radio's listening with you. It really does pull you back in time a bit and make you feel connected to those who listened to Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Waylon Jennings and so many other greats perform in the center of that same circle.I highly recommend buying the Post-Show Guided Backstage tour once in your life. Going through the same doors that modern stars go through, seeing the wall of Golden names who have joined the Opry, looking at the uniquely designed rooms where the greats have sat before going on stage and finally being able to stand in the Unbroken Circle itself, looking out into the lights of the audience, you feel for a moment what it must be like in their shoes. It was an amazing experience for me knowing that I was standing on the same ground walked by those I watched as kids and who have passed beyond. You don't have to get as surreal as I did, but I think it brings you out of this being just some place once you take in the enormity of what went behind its construction and what was created by it.If you're in Nashville this place, to me, is an absolute must. If you'd like to spend a day then go across to the Opry Mills shops, take in the Aquarium and visit Madam Tussauds Wax Museum. There is plenty to keep you occupied before a late night show or after an afternoon one. The acts are also a mix of talent but generally have a Hall of Fame singer with top end young talent."
Loved every minute. The nostalgia. It’s a beautiful place. Listened to Charley Pride and my grandparents were in heaven. Really enjoyed the entire show!
"I have wanted to get to Nashville for years to visit the Grand Ole Opry, ever since seeing the movie, ""Coalminer's Daughter.""  Didn't really like the movie much but was always wanting to get to the Opry. We got front row center mezzaine seats and they were fantastic. I do think they could advertise better on how to get taxis to and from, even form a taxi line. They should also be more specific about all the food options there, as there were many, not to mention there is a major shopping mall right next door. The drink prices were outrageous--more than $22 for a double whiskey and pepsi, but I guess that is to be expected. I didn't recognize most of the singers but they were all good, and everyone was so polite and friendly, on and off stage. Great time!"
"Pretty much speechless! If you visit Nashville and you haven’t come to the Ole Opry... you haven’t been to Nashville at all. The backstage tour is expensive but so worth it. Billy our tour man, was delightful, patient and extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Standing on the circle looking to the stalls... sent chills through my entire body!"
"Take the tour n gain a new perspective on the family of the ""big circle"" of fame. The ole opry s history is a tribute to country and those who have wowed us fans. Stand at the mic and feel the spirit of those stars n idols who have performed the organized chaos that is opry"
"Loved the night of music - both new and old classics. It felt like a visit back to my childhood. The Opry is an institution and you feel like you are a part of it. I paid for the premium seats and I probably wouldn’t do that again, but I would come back in a heartbeat."
Another item checked off my bucket list - the legendary home to Country Music and its finest.  SO MUCH HISTORY in this place.  Make sure you do the back stage tour when there - you won't be disappointed.  All the legends have passed through those doors.  And if you can catch a show while there.
Visited the area surrounding the Grand Ole Opry and took in a show starring Vince Gill and Whispering Bill Anderson.  Great show.
Was not disappointed; saw Marty Stewart and the Gatlin Brothers. Great seats and great performances by all.
Saw Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer show here.   Classic place.   Clean and open venue.   Would come back again.
Such a fun place. The history. The bluegrass.  The country stars.  The bluegrass.  Wait!  I said bluegrass twice?!?   I was fantastic.  They have food. They have a bar.  You bring it to your seats and take as many pictures as you like and just enjoy yourself.  It is. Live radio variety show so each artist plays 2 or 3 songs at most.  The highlight of tour trip and you can’t help but smile ear to ear upon leaving the Opry. Uber Lyft and Taxis are waiting outside the main entrance when leaving a late show so no trouble getting a ride back into town after the show.
"Very informative.  Enjoyed all of tour.  Excellent guide.Seeing the dressing rooms, stage where Her Haw was filmed and of course the main stage was an enjoyable experience."
"Pretty cool tour through history... getting a glimpse of country history in a great facility. Took about 45 minutes and ended with a picture on stage with the microphone and guitar. Got to see the changing rooms, backstage, a great intro video, ...."
"This was our first trip to Nashville.  We did not know much about the Grand Ole Opry except that's where country singers dreamed to perform.  It was a 1 hr. guided tour.  We got our tickets online before we went.  The tickets cost $33 + $3/tix fee +2.50 etix fee.  It's about a 19 min uber ride from downtown Nashville.  We were all pleasantly surprised.  The tour was timely, well organized and very interesting.  You went backstage where the dressing room were and then you got to go on the stage and they took your picture with a guitar.   We are all not country music fans, but we loved it so much that we booked tickets to come to experience the Opry at night.  No one famous was playing, but in case we never got back.  It was a fun night!"
"Being in Nashville for a meeting, we only had Sun. afternoon to see the sights. The introduction by Garth and Trisha was very good. Our female guide was very knowledgeable and funny! I would hate to miss seeing where the great country artists have performed! We really didn't know much about the Grand Ole Opry but will now listen to it whenever possible on Fri. and Sat. evenings."
"Took the backstage tour at the Grand Ole Opry. I would highly recommend it to anyone who visits Nashville. One country fan and three not so much, thoroughly enjoyed the backstage tour. It was informative, fun, and we had an awesome tour guide, which I’m sure made it that much better.  The tour helped us to better understand where the stars are coming from and what it means to them to become a member of the Grand Old Opry. Highly recommend!"
Great entertainment for the family or alone. We loved it. Wasn’t too pricy and the tour is amazing in itself just the history of the building.
"Took in a show on a Tuesday.  Was great as always.  Comfortable seats, great screens to view!!  Easy parking but hated to pay large parking fee after paying plenty for tickets.  Good star line up!!  Blue grass, gospel and country.  Trace Atkins!!!"
Wonderful place to visit and see the concert.  Our show was  fast paced and the entertainment was lively. Was not that familiar with the entertainers but still enjoyed the show and experience. Acoustic sound is great.
Did the tour on Thursday 2/20 with tour guide Randy who was excellent- bit of history combined with a lot of fun.Went to the Opry on Saturday night 2/22 and had a wonderful time. Great show!Must go if you’re in Nashville.
"Sitting in the theater where Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and so many other Country Music Legions preformed makes you feel the history once inside the building. They have the actual flooring on stage where the greats once stood. Artists want to preform there and pull you into their presentations. What history. A must-see when in Nashville even if you are not a country music fan!"
Going to the opry is a must. We had great seats in section 4..row 6 ..seats 5 thru 8...entertainment was good and a great show.
"The Opry is a great experience with world class musicians and a fun friendly vibe.  Starting with the web site and ticketing process, you can select tickets knowing exactly how you will see the stage because a small picture pops up showing the stage from your seat before your purchase.  Prices were extremely fair for a world class experience and seeing top tier music talent.Arriving at the Opry is easy.  We took an Uber, but taxis were also an option.  Getting dropped off at the entrance was beautiful and a short walk into the building.  There are very few stairs and I'm sure there were ramps because everything at the Opry showed signs of accommodating those with handicaps.  The staff and security were extremely welcoming and compared to going to other music venues, this was the best experience from curb to seat.  Speaking of seats, I read other reviews that criticized the church pew seating, but I thought it was great and the pews are padded, so extremely comfortable.There were lots of options for dinner both inside the Opry and at Opry Mills mall which is a very short walk and lots of choices.  If you purchase food inside the Opry, you can bring it to your seat.  After the show, it's easy to get outside and back to the curb, however, be warned...  it's a sea of taxis and limos.  Our Uber driver called us and directed us to walk away from the chaos and we were on our way in minutes.  I've attended many theatre and music events all over the world and I've NEVER see such a taxi cluster even outside grand central station in NYC, so be prepared!Attending the Opry was a bucket list event and although I wouldn't rank myself as a huge country music buff, I thoroughly enjoyed the entire event."
"Seemed like a blast from the past as we sat in pews listening to good, country music. Although many around us didn't like sitting like that, I thought it added to the ambiance. So much fun!"
"This show will always be something I remember.  Even though no big name artists, they were all big in my eyes and phenomenal!  We laughed, we cried, we clapped and enjoyed our $20 beverages!  Haha. No seat is a bad seat.  We did the backstage tour which in my opinion they allow too many folks to attend.. interesting but also a lot of wasted time just standing around while other groups got their tours.  Did enjoy it and glad we did it.  So worth seeing a show and I will always go when in Nashville!"
