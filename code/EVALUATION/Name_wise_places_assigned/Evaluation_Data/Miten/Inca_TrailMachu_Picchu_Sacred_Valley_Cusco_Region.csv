"We did a lot of research to find the right trip/providerSome facts- 2 day tour with overnight stay in Aguas Calientes- Private tour (2 of us) with our own tour guide- 12 km hike of Inca trail with finish at sun gate (Day 1)- exploring Macchu Picchu with guide (Day 2)- 420 USD per person- booked it 3 weeks ahead (there were no permits for the long Inca Trail left)- Tour Operator United Mice12 km Inca TrailIt's a lovely walk and took us around 6 hrs in total including launch, photo sessions etc.We visited the site Winay Wayna before we alles the last kilometers to Macchu Picchu. You have to climb some very steep stairs! The locals call it gringo killer which is very accurate! The trail ends at the sun gate and it's a great feeling to arrive there and finally see Macchu Picchu after the hike!Price420 USD. We were shocked by the prices at the start but once you are at Macchu Picchu and Aguas Calientes you understand. Average hotels are 120 USD, train around 120USD and a return bus ticket up to the site is 24USD. So we started to understand why the tour was so dear. Looking back it was ok.Tour Operator- United MiceVery organized. We got a detailed induction the day before so we knew what to expect. The guide Walter shared a lot of his knowledge with us during the hike and at the Inca sites. The guys even gave us a free lift to the bus station on the day after we had come back from the tour! Great service"
"We did the trek with tour company Uncover Latin America who were brilliant in every aspect. Chris was our first point of contact and he was ever so helpful and patient, our guide Oscar was a pleasant character, very talkative and keen to pass on his wisdom. We got really big meal portions and all the food was a delicious, really important when hiking all day in the Andes. With all this we were then left to enjoy the magic this 4 day trek has to offer. The only unique advice I can probably offer is to do plenty of stretching exercises each morning, your legs and whole body will get a work out. Loved the lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge at the end of our tour of Machu Picchu."
"Walking the Inca trial was an amazing experience. We travelled with llama travel from the uk who use condor travel as their local agents, the guys at condor were truly 5 star thought and highly recommended. My main suggestions for the trail are to pack light and hire walking sticks even if you think you wont need them they make the down hills alot easier. The hard work will be worth it when you reach the sun gate on day 4."
"Went with family for the short Inca trail hike. It was a two day trip with hike on first day and Machu Picchu on second day. Our tour guide from Kaypi Tours Lito was awesome. He took care of everything. Great views, waterfalls, Inca ruins. Overall a lot of fun."
"My partner and I did the 4 day classic Inca trail with reputable company. The company was great and everything was well organised and as expected. My comments on one Inca trail are more for guidance to other trekkers. We did some training beforehand but going to the gym regularly. Our main focus was strength training and cardio. We did this for 4 to 5 months regularly, i.e. at least 5 times a week. Trust me this was enough to be ready for the trek. We were physically ready for the trek and didn't suffer physically. We had the following stops on our trek: Day 1: Walyabamba Day 2: PacamoyoDay 3: Winay WanayDay 1: This was not too challenging and easy. I believe anyone who is reasonably motivated can do this. Day 2: Going up to deadwoman's pass was challenging but doable. We were very breathless but we made it. Getting down from deadwoman' s pass was another story. It was terrible endless going down on some very large steps. Day 3: The start was hard as we had to go up and down  twice to reach two maintain peaks. The  we had to tackle the steps all the way down. This was hard but not as bad as day 2. Day 4 was amazing to reach machu puchu and see the wonderful sight. You may be wondering why average review. I had to be honest the biggest challenge for us on the trek was coping with illness. In my group of 9 there were 6 ill people. Day 2 we had an illness due to altitude and the person could not continue. At the second part of DAY 2 my partner was very ill. He could barely walk and the worst part of that he couldn't go back. He had some very severe digestive issues which was a real challenge given we were on a trek and the only available toilet is nature.The campsite at Day 2 was terrible. It was like sleeping on some stones. It was very uncomfortable. Day 3 was another day of illness. 5 people were ill including myself. The range of issues were stomach issues, throwing up, diarrhoea, nausea and cold. It was a really bad day for the whole team and we struggled to finish. The fact that were so ill made it bad for us and the motivation was just so low on this day. By the end of DAY 3 most of us had lost our appetite and no longer interested in food. I certainly became worried about food and water during this trek becuase we were feeling so unwell.Similar comments on day 3 about the campsite. It was like sleeping on the floor due to all the stones. Before you go on the trek ask yourself:- Can I cope with no shower for 4 days?- Can I sleep in a small tent on the ground for 4 days?- Can I stay positive even in the worst moment ?If it's yes to the above then go ahead in your holiday. Day 4 :"
"we booked on the 4d/3n inca trail with Bioandean Expeditions  after doing a lot of research and reading the reviews. Wow! What an amazing company. Everything was absolutely perfect and we could not recommend them highly enough to anyone thinking about doing some trekking while in Peru. We met our guides for the trip, Edmar ""Apu and Rider at the Bioandean Expedition offices for our briefing the night before and they were absolutely brilliant. As well as taking care of everything during the trek, they were both very friendly, extremely funny and very knowledgeable about the Incas and their way of life. Edmard  is such an enthusiastic and fun loving person it is hard not to have a great time. His pipe playing definitely takes the edge off the hard climbs on the way! Bioandean have definitely thought of everything to make your trek special, including great equipment, fantastic camping spots and even private toilets (which none of the other companies offer). The underlying philosophy behind Bioandean Expeditions is to offer the best possible service while at the same time ensuring that the porters and support staff that provide that service are well looked after. You can see this in the equipment and clothing that the porters ""The Bio Warriers"" have compared to other companies and also by their general happiness throughout the trip. They are always smiling! It is genuinely unbelievable how they cover so much terrain in such a short amount of time carrying all of the camping equipment and luggage. Yet every day when you arrive at camp they are waiting for you with hot drinks, clean water and food. Oh my god, the food! Every single day the chef produced a dazzling array of delicious food. I cannot empathies enough how good the food is. Restaurant quality food cooked in camp and served in a private dining tent. Dinners and lunches were 3 course affairs with mains consisting of 4-5 different types of food. It has to be seen to be believed! All in all Bioandean Expeditions  far exceeded all of my expectations and if you can book a spot on one of their treks you will not be disappointed.Great work guys! Keep doing this job  you 100% deserved this review"
"I’m reviewing the 4 day, 3 night inca trail which we did in 3 days during the beginning of rainy season. I cannot write this review without thinking about the hobbits from Fellowship of the Ring.  Those little hobbits were courageous and never gave up while trekking through Middle Earth in what was a very worthy cause to save the world.  However if there was a direct train to Mordor then they would be silly not to use it. Especially when time was such an issue. This is how stupid I felt at the end of the first day of the inca trail.  If you are traveling to Machu Picchu then don’t feel ashamed for getting the train.  You are not cheating, you will see the exact same Machu Picchu as I did but without the hassle.The trail itself after the first few pleasant hours either goes directly up or directly down. Both of which are not nice for different reasons. Going up gave me bad asthma due to wet weather and altitude. Going down kills your knees and the wet rocks can cause you to slip and potentially hurt yourself badly at any moment. The scenary is quite nice but you will rarely see it as you will be looking at your boots for 90% of the time so not to fall over and the last 2 days we did not see anything because of the rain clouds.  The bottom line is, its not fun or certainly not my kind of fun.This is made worse by the fact that when you do arrive at Machu Picchu mentally and physically drained you are confronted with hundreds of tourists all fresh faced with clean jeans and relaxed smiles enjoying the sites having just got off the train. They have no idea what you have been through and spoil any picture of the ancient city you try to take with their brightly coloured rain coats walking through the centre of the city. This review would be different if trekking was the only way to visit Machu Picchu but its not. There is a comfortable train that takes you on a beautiful route in-between the mountains alongside the river.  The hobbits had to do it. You don’t!Some people have told me that I should be proud of completing the inca trail with asthma and altitude sickness. Many people probably would be but me, I just feel stupid for not getting the train and spending more time in the magical city of Cusco."
"I am almost 65 and just finished it.  Day 2 is an unbelievable challenge but we went with good friends and the great folks from Alpaca Adventures.  I highly recommend them to increase your odds of success. I am being showered with praise and wow's from my friens.  Not for everyone, but if it is for you,do it, train, and go as early in your life as is possible.  Ending with the morning view of Mahu Picchu from the Sun Gate cannot be described or photographed."
"We recently completed the 2 day Inca Trail trek.  Upon arrival, we were advised by our tour company that due to a problem with the trail (bridge out?), our route had been changed so that we departed from km 106 instead of km 104.  This change put us on the Porter's Trail: an intense, steep series of switchback stone stairs straight up a mountain to Winay Wayna. It was challenging and exhausting and took from 2-3 hours for members of our group to complete. It was a far cry from the advertised original km 104 route which is supposed to be suitable for people of average fitness.  I'm not even sure what we missed out on by not going on the original trail.  The good news is that everybody in our group did manage to successfully complete this portion, and the rest of the trek to the Sun Gate seemed like a breeze by comparison.  Check with your tour company about the route detour and consider your fitness level before you commit."
"We had a guide from Peruvian Soul (Peruvian Soul managed our entire Peru experience wonderfully) picking us up in town (AC) and walking the train tracks to KM106 at around 6 AM. This ended up to be a nice warm-up prior to crossing the river and starting up the trail.As many other reviews state, the quality of the guide is essential and understanding this is a porter's trail makes the hike easier. Porters literally run by you carrying sacks of refuge and whatever from their catered clients high above.There were six of us - the oldest (me) being 60 with the youngest 35. This was a challenging hike, but did not require a level 10 for an hour on a stair-master. Nor do you need to be a spin-class instructor - have a small group + guide and set a pace.The trail is quite well covered with trees and plants - not too exposed. The trail from the river to the Sun Gate is in quite good shape too. The Inca sections are beyond descriptions - just simply amazing to walk on stones placed 600 years prior in an environment unimaginable, but this applies to all the Inca sites.We arrived at the Sun Gate around 1PM and had an absolutely great time from there to Machu Picchu itself. Other reviews complain about the hike perhaps and the time of day - my suggestion is to get up early, have a select group of folks (not strangers), and a good guide - all is simple from there.Allocate two hours to visit Winay Wana on the trek up. I suggest making this your longer rest stop as this Inca site is beyond description. As all hikers round the bend and see it for the first time there is more astonishment than perhaps Machu Picchu itself. Missing this site and not having time would be unfortunate. Advise the guide you'd like to drink water/food there as opposed to the porter's camp.The hike from the porter's camp to the Sun Gate is relatively easy and is stunning in views and Inca architecture. The scramble up the stairs just prior to the Sun Gate is a hoot.We hiked around the region for four days with Machu Picchu being our literal journey's end. Peruvian Soul arranged our holiday and i would suggest them. Eloy was our group's #1 guide, but all guides were efficient, polite and well informed. I suggest visiting other Inca sites requiring a bit of a hike prior to Machu Picchu and I would recommend spending the day on 106 and Machu Picchu and skipping the town stuff.Our visit was epic.The altitude and endless steps made the physical side challenging but rewarding. Carry a quality framed pack and goodies and confirm your boots have new tread!"
"We did the four day Inca Trail trek with View Peru. Was an amazing experience. Tough at times but well worth it. The views are spectacular. If you do it, make sure you research your tour group carefully. Some are better than others. I would def recommend View Peru & Signatures."
"We trekked with PERU TREKS, I absolutely could not rate them highly enough. Our guides, Edwin and Pepe were knowledgable, friendly and helpful. As Edwin told us at the start, it's about the journey, which almost outweighed Machu Picchu  for me! I could write an essay about the whole experience but simply, it was amazing. The porters are some of the most incredible people I have ever seen, the food was delicious, we were woken up with coca tea in the morning and to top it off with were with an amazing group of people. We always seemed to have the best camping spots and our porters always seem happy. You will never feel so proud, walking around sweaty and smelly, amongst clean, fresh smelling tourists with their guides pointing at you saying 'they just came off of the 3 night 4 day trek!' and seeing the impressed look on their clean faces. I did loads of research, and these guys came out really well, paying their porters well and not cutting costs. Good quality equipment. Don't go for the cheapest trek you find, you will regret it!! Not for the squeamish - be prepared for the unsightly sights in the 'toilets', bring loo roll, snacks and determination. The altitude is tough, day 2 is tough. Just take it at your own pace, keep moving and you will reach the top of the pass!!!"
"We have just arrived back from our 4 day trek along the Inca Trail with Peru Treks. It was definitely challenging physically but our excellent guides, Manny and Jimmy supported our group of 12 (age range 12-53) at all times. They were positive, encouraging, informative, funny and caring. The food prepared by our chef, Lucio was of the highest standard and even included a birthday cake (not sure how you cook a cake on the Inca Trail?!) the porters were also excellent and attentive at all times. What a fantastic experience. Thank you Peru Treks. We will never forget it."
"I have just walked the Inca Trail with Peru Treks, who are an excellent, responsible company with experienced and knowledgeable guides, superb cooks, great porter welfare and also support local community projects. I strongly recommend them for this trek, you will be well looked after. The trek itself is fabulous. Arriving at the Sun Gate high above Machu Picchu, after three or four days of trekking in the footsteps and past the palaces, fortresses and watch towers of the Incas is magical. I took the advice to acclimatise and do smaller before this one, walking Colca Canyon the week before, and spending time in both Puno and Cusco beforehand, and I was glad I did. I never had to take an altitude pill, just a few coca leaves and sweets. I was also very glad to have a camelback style water carrier, regularly sipping water especially when the sun came out. Everyone talks about Dead Woman's Pass on day 2, but Day 3 is equally challenging, although this was easily the most spectacularly beautiful and interesting part of the trail, walking on original Inca paved paths for much of the way. If doing this in March/April, expect rain, and the chance that Machu Picchu will be in cloud at the time of sunrise. The weather however changes rapidly over the course of the day, and this wondrous citadel in the clouds looks amazing in every type of weather!"
"It´s the best trek I have ever done, I am from Denver so we do alot of trekking. Think Lord of the Rings mixed with Indiana Jones, amazing scenery and archeological adventure. We were recommended Uncover Latin America through my work friend who sang them praises, and we would quickly like to do the same. Chris who organized our trip was great, there were limited spaces at the time we booked but he made sure he got things done swiftly and got our spaces, explained everything very transparently. Our guide Hector was amazing with over 15 years experience, he managed our group exceptionally well and everyone had a fun time. Food was way beyond what we were expecting, and we enjoyed a delicious buffet lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge after our visit to Machu Picchu. The trek was just the right challenge and thorough rewarding. Dead Woman´s pass on Day 2 was a challenge, pack some Snicker´s, Gummy Bears, Gatorades and chocolates to help give you the extra energy you need on this day. We had 2 days in Cusco to acclimatize before starting the trek. Book the trek at least 4 months in advance, despite doing this it was a real last minute rush to get our spaces."
"We did the Inca discovery tour with G adventures in early Dec and had an incredible time! Our guide, JP, was absolutely fantastic - really passionate and enthusiastic about sharing his culture and incredibly knowledgeable. We always felt safe and supported.This review will focus on the Inca trail part of the tour but we also really enjoyed visiting the pottery and weaving co-ops and Cusco as well. Bring enough soles if you want to buy souvenirs at the co-ops. I bought a scarf and baby alpaca shawl and spent about S300. The pottery is less expensive. We stayed at prisma hotel in Cusco and we were able to do overnight laundry - 6soles/kg so very reasonable. For the trail here are a few tips:Packing - the porters will carry 6kg and you are provided with a duffle bag. The duffle bag is not waterproof - bring a dry bag if you have one. If you rent the air mattresses and sleeping bags from g adventures these add up to 3.5kg leaving you with 2.5kg. Everything else will be carried in your day pack. Definitely rent the optional air mattress if you didn’t bring your own. The ones provided are extremely thin and it gets cold at night. The hotel you stay at the night before the trail has a scale so you can weigh your bag.Hygiene - The porters set up your tents and air mattresses for you. They also bring you a basin of warm water in the morning and coca tea in your tent which is lovely. You can consider bringing some soap and a small towel. Toilets - combination of squat and regular toilets. Bring toilet paper and hand sanitizer. The bathrooms on the first day are not free so bring 1 sole coins.Food - incredible! The chefs are truly amazing and cater to all dietary needs and preferences.  They even made a birthday cake in the middle of the trail! Lunch is generally the largest meal with soup, a main and dessert. Dinner is soup and a main. We did bring some trail mix and a chocolate bar for snacks while hiking but you definitely don’t need to bring much other than that. They also provide you with a bag of snacks at the start of the trail. The trail - the first day is straightforward and not very difficult. You will pass by stands selling snacks and drinks as well as several Incan ruins. The second day is fairly difficult as you do dead woman’s pass and the trail is very up and down. A few in our group did get altitude sickness and one had to turn back. Consider acetazolamide for this trail. We had torrential rain on our 3rd day - buy a cheap poncho in Cusco and bring it as it really helps keep you dry. The rain was so heavy that it was difficult to stay dry even with rain pants and a good rain jacket. Get the large size as it can cover your day pack as well. The fourth day is fairly easy hiking - you do need to start early around 4am. I did use hiking poles for this trail which I would recommend. I hadn’t hiked with them before but there were some steep downhill steps that were slippery in the rain. Tipping: you can tip in either soles or USD. Porters - 150 soles per person minimum! These guys are amazing - they carry everything and literally run the trail to set up camp before you arrive huffing and puffing with a tiny day pack. You can tell they are treated well with g adventures. For example they are all provided with hiking boots, jackets etc. Some of the other porters we saw were wearing old converse like shoes or even flip flops and were carrying more weight.Drivers - 5-10soles/person. Generally need to do this twice - for the driver that takes you to and from Cusco Main guide - we tipped a bit more than g adventures recommended because out guide was fantastic - $30USD/person."
"My wife and I joined a party of 6 in total on the 4 day hike. It exceeded our expectations whilst the loo situation is exactly as you expect it (grim). The hike itself actually we all thought was not too bad, sure day 2 you climb high but if you've done some prep, it's not that bad, unless you have altitude sickness. Views are amazing and it's a constant photo opportunity. Camping was fun, food was great considering you are in the middle of nowhere. Chef was accommodating  to dietary requirements. If you are thinking about doing this, stop and book it, you will love every minute of it. But, please book with a reputable company to ensure the porters are treated fair. We saw one porter with another company and he was on the verge of collapse, it was upsetting and we fed and watered him. We used condor travel who seemed to have the best spots at every campsite, had a happy team and have a really good reputation."
"We started our journey by being dropped of quickly from the train at km 104.  We crossed the bridge and hiked over to the check point.  Our guide had the necessary paper work, but we needed to show our passport and the passport number had to match the number on the paperwork.     Once we made it through the check point, we used the bathroom, which was a pit toilet.  There are no other bathroom facilities until you reached the lunch stop, which is a four to five hour hike.    The beginning of the hike was out in the open with no trees.  It was quite hot with the sun beating on you.  There are little rest huts placed along the trail about an hour apart.  They have benches in them and a roof to offer protection from the sun.  It is a great place to rest and have a protein bar and some water.     When we reached the waterfall, we placed our hands in the water and cooled off, it felt wonderful.  After this, there was more shade and the walk was more pleasant.    We stopped for lunch, which we carried in our back pack.  After we finished eating, we continued on our hike for another 3 hours.  We finally made it to the Sun Gate and stopped and posed for many pictures.     Make sure to carry at minimum two bottles of water and a granola bar.  I wore Merrell shoes and my husband wore Merrel hiking boots.  Good boots or shoes are important, but a descent pair of tennis shoes would have been OK.  Sun screen is important too.  We put bug spray on at the first check point.     Parts of the trail are very steep.  If you decide to do this hike, get into shape.  It is a solid 8 hours of walking upwards.  Try to carry as little as possible.  Your backpack gets very heavy.  I wore zip off pants and unzipped them at the first check point."
"We did the Inca trail group service with Llama Path who I highly recommend, the service we received from start to finish was incredible which made the whole experience the best trek I’ve ever been on in 2 years of travelling. You’ll get a briefing the day before you leave at their office so you know what to expect & make sure you have all the right equipment ready. I advise to book the Inca trail in advance as it can become booked up really quickly & there are only a limited number of tickets a day on this trail! Day 1, 3 & 4 of the trail are a lot easier than day 2 where there are 2 passes you need to complete & reach the highest altitude, however the guides will stay with you at all times & help you get through it if you struggle. Throughout the trail there are many archaeological sites you visit which are interesting & break up your trail for a nice rest. The weather can change all the time so I recommend taking layers, waterproofs and waterproof covers for your bag, insect repellent & sun cream.This hike can be a challenge but do able for all ages, just take it slow & steady as there is quite a bit of uphill & a lot of steps! Hire a porter if you think you might struggle with the extra weight, it might be worth it."
"We had the trip of a lifetime and were so pleased that we chose gAdventures.  After much research, I chose gAdventures because of their reputation and experience/history of treks on the Inca Trail.  They have a head office in Toronto and when I called into one of their reps to discuss the trip, they spent 40 minutes explaining details before I even booked with them.  They were also extremely helpful when Air Canada cancelled our direct flight to Lima three weeks before our trip started.  They worked hard to find alternate flights for us and to minimize the stress. Our group of 16 were fantastic travel companions – we met the night before hitting the trail and quickly became good friends.  Our group members came from Australia, Canada, USA, England and luckily everyone was very supportive and we had lots of laughs along the way.  Our guide Rumi was extremely passionate about Inca Culture and took great care to ensure we had an extremely positive trip.  We were accompanied by 23 Chasquis (porters) and two cooks. It truly is amazing how hard they work and how effortless they make it look.  I was so surprised by the quality of food and snacks and the dining tent that was set up made for a comfortable environment to share meals after a long day.  When our group arrived for lunch and in the late afternoon for camp we were greeted with cool drinks and individual washbasins to prepare for a meal. Lunch and dinner were 2-3 courses and always started with a hearty soup.  We had one vegetarian and one person that required gluten free food and they were fully accommodated.   On the third day, our chefs managed to freshly prepare a cake with icing.  Every morning the Chasquis wake you with steaming cocoa leaf tea and a warmed wash basin. We felt very well cared for.We rented an inflatable thin foam mat, sleeping bag and hiking poles – they were clean and no need for a sleeping bag liner.  The mat and bag are included in the baggage weight that the porters can carry and takes up approx. half of the 6 kg allowance; therefore it is imperative you pack lightly. They provide a smaller duffle bag for your stuff that the porters carry.   There is a scale in the lobby area at Hotel Prisma so definitely weigh your daypack and do not overload it as you will be lugging it with you each day. I noticed that our group wore pretty much the same clothes on the trek –no need nor is there room to bring multiple changes of clothing.  There is an opportunity to shower on the third day but it is freezing cold water so only one group member did it.  About half our group experienced altitude sickness to some extent – I definitely did and initially experienced headache, nausea and general malaise.  I was glad my physician prescribed Diamox to take. The only side effect was tingling in my fingers and toes and having to void more frequently.   Our guide had a finger pulse oximeter and my oxygen levels measured in the low 80’s – they had supplemental oxygen tanks with them and thankfully I did not have to use it.   The trail itself is very challenging especially when you factor the possibility of altitude sickness. If you hike and are reasonably fit and take your time, you should not have any problem.  The second day is definitely the hardest with 4-5 hours of unrelenting uphill climbing at a high altitude - it is quite hard to catch your breath. This is followed by downhill for about 2 hours which interestingly can be just as hard as uphill – tough on the knees and ankles so adjust our hiking poles accordingly.  I was in awe of the archaeological sites and ruins along the path – always something to see and the vistas are breath taking.  It is funny to see llamas walking on the path as well. Despite it being dry season we experienced rain for 3 out of 4 days – so that made it challenging to be constantly pulling on and off a rain poncho.  Fortunately for the last day, the sun came out and we were able to see the sun rise over the Sungate and had a picture perfect day for Machu Pichu.  Definitely use bug spray at Machu Pichu.  I did not feel the bugs biting my ankles and had welts that took weeks to heal.   You can stamp your passport at Machu Pichu with a neat MP stamp – there was a short line to do this.  The lines for the washrooms (female) were crazy – you line up to pay and then wait to use the facilities.  The bathroom are clean and have a toilet seat which is a welcome site after using the squat toilets on the trail.  Take a bottle of water/drink into MP with you because you will have to exit if you want to purchase them or to use the washroom.  After touring this incredible wonder of the world, we took the bus and met at a restaurant in Aqua Caliendes for a final meal together.  There are places in the town where you can pay to shower and one of our group members did that but she didn’t have clean clothes to put on.  If I could be guaranteed good weather (no rain), I would definitely do this trip again – it just was such a phenomenal experience.  I would highly recommend gAdventures as they will give you a safe, authentic experience with like-minded travelers.  Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to message me."
"My daughter and I had always wanted to trek the Inca Trail. We booked with Explore who were great. Everything was organised perfectly (thanks Hector our guide). The Inca Trail is not for the faint hearted. We had done some training but it soon became evident that more training would have helped!!The scenery is beautiful and changes daily. Mountain views, rain forest, Inca ruins and cloud forests. Trekking at allitude is an experience in its self. I just walked at a slower pace than normal so I could breath at a comfortable rate and enjoy talking with my fellow Trekkers and enjoy the scenery. Walking through the Sun Gate and seeing Macchu Picchu for the first time as amazing!! (It is another hours trek from there to MP).There is no doubt that , for me, the Inca a Trail was a physical challenge and also a mental challenge. If you are thinking of doing it, go for it, but do train as much as possible so that you can enjoy the experience and your surroundings."
"We chose Alpaca Expeditions and were not sorry to do this adventure with 'The Green Machine'. Our guides, Rosel and Toribio (Toro) were truly outstanding. The trail itself is not for the faint of heart, and was more difficult because we had 3 days of rain. Would I do it again? Nope. Am I glad I did it? Absolutely!"
"Reading the other reviews on here and some peoples unfortunate experiences makes me so happy I booked with G Adventures. I did the trek in the cross over between April/May. We met our team and were provided with the walking poles we hiried (Do it! You'll be thankful on the way down!) a snack bag and met our 3 guides, People have posted alot about how crowded the trail was, I didn't experience this at all. On day 1 I walked almost half of it alone or next to local people. Day 2 as you can clearly see the route up to dead woman's pass can seem more croweded but it was never a problem and day 3 except for a few small traffic jams, I mainly walked with a couple of friends without another person in sight! The final campsite was pretty crazy but that's to be expected. G provided us with an amazing team of porters and chefs, easily identified by the purple gear and backpacks. They treated them wonderfully, we all tipped well for their services and interacted at all camp stops. They all had a smile on their faces and were constantly mucking about together, playing games at camp during their time off periods and it made me feel happy I was contributing to a company that look after their staff. Our food was absolutley amazing and they even baked us a huge cake on day 3 for lunch!The trek itsself was tough but not impossible and it's mainly in your head when the altitude was making the uphill tough on day two. But I loved it and would do it again in a heart beat! Don't hesistate just book it! We had amazing weather, bright sunshine every day - except of course at the sungate which I hear is actually pretty common but the site cleared and allowed us amazing photos."
"The Inca Trail was definitely the experience of a lifetime! My husband and I booked the 4 day trek with Condor Travel and it was fantastic from start to finish. The hike is challenging but the trails are very good and well maintained. The elevation is quite varied and the second day we walked/climbed from 3100m up to 4215m. It took a while and was hard work but it was still amazing.The views are stunning and there are a few Inca sites along the way, which were very interesting. Paul, our guide was fantastic, very very knowledgeable and very helpful. Always asking how we were and how we were feeling. The porters were amazing, carrying all the equipment needed and we were always welcomed into the camp with them all clapping. The chef was amazing and we ate superbly well, 2 courses of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, we even had freshly caught trout on the first day! They all made the whole experience extra special. Walking up to the Sun Gate was so exciting on the last morning and even though it was a bit misty and cloudy so we couldn't see Machu Picchu very well it was still amazing. Would definitely recommend this trek and Condor Travel, superb!"
"4 day trek with three nights camping.  Prior to the trek was a little visit to the womens' COOP which was high up, cold but interesting looking at how textiles are made and what traditional living looks like.  Following that we went to the sacred valley for a tour and some photos.  That's where you get the sense that you are in for some beautiful scenery. The first hotel you stay at you can get wifi and eat/drink at some nice little restaurants in Ollaytatambo.  You will also see some impressive ruins there.By this time you should know whether you are prone to altitude sickness and should be ready for the hike.  G adventures are pretty good looking at some of the other groups/companies knocking about.  They certainly have a great porter service which is worth a lot whilst trekking.  The trek itself is doable but very challenging even if you are fit.  If you can limit yourself to your own pace with discipline then there should be no problem but pack well.The toilets.  Be prepared for the toilets.  Imagine the toilets from the film trainspotting and then times that by 10.  Now you can see and possible smell the campsite toilets. I couldn't cope so I took the toilet roll I used and disappeared up the mountain for peaceful, civilized relief. So did many others.  You also have access to a shower but I would place them in the same category.  I had one on the trek and survived with wet wipes.  Everyone says it is horrific because it actually is.  Something else to consider is paying a little extra for your own tent.  If your roommate has a cold and/or snores like a sleeping lion lent against a microphone, paracetamol and ear plugs will not save you.  This will exhaust you during the walking.The scenery is beautiful especially on day three when you hit the beginning of the amazon.  Very beautiful and tranquil.Beware of dead woman's pass.  I saw a lot of dead looking men and women on the way up.  Very hard-take regular breaks and be very careful coming down.  Very steep and uneven steps.Once you reach the Machu Picchu you will have a tour before beginning your journey back to Ollaytatambo by bus then train then bus.The money, the time, the travel, the lack of familiarity, no hot showers, awful toilets. Is it worth it? Absolutely.  Great place, great people. Unforgettable.  Cusquena the local beer helps and is actually sold on day 2 on the way up to dead woman's pass."
"We just finished a 2 day inca trail with 'tierras Vivas' agency. The trail is great, but our guide Ana Maria was terrible. She barely gave us any information and she didn't put any effort. A waste of money. Be very careful with who you book the trail!!!!"
We did the Inca trail as part of our honeymoon. Booked through G Adventures. What an amazing experience. Day two through dead woman’s pass is tough going but so worth it. Would highly recommend
"We have just returned from Peru after spending a month there which included hiking the Inca Trail , doing the four day, three night trek.  I thought I would share my training tips.  My biggest piece of advice would be start early and build up slowly.  This will build up endurance and help avoid injury.  Leaving it to the last few weeks, especially when you are older and not fitness fanatic (like me) is just a recipe for disaster.  I am fortunate because I don't work full time and live a short distance from hilly National Parks.  In saying that, if you live in a city area most training can be done in a gym, or even a high rise building with lots of flights of stairs.  I started hiking ten weeks out from the day we left Australia (we didn't actually start the hike until two weeks after that) so if you stop your training a week or so before you leave then don't walk for another two weeks or so, you will start to lose fitness.  This is why starting out as early as possible will help and try to train up until you go. The first six weeks of training I did two ten kilometre hikes in the hills per week.  The last four weeks I increased it to three ten kilometre hikes a week.  This is all the training I did.  I did not attend the gym or use any training equipment as the hills I walked were enough to push my heart rate up.  If you don't have access to hill walks, then substitute if for the stairmaster or flights of stairs in a building, believe me, the amount of steps you wil be climbing is unbelievable.  Of course the bike, treadmill or any sort of interval training are good to get your heart rate up as cardio is important.  If you can get out and do a bushwalk even once a week, on an uneven bush trail this will help with strengthening your ankles and helping with balance as the Inca Trail is uneven and requires concentration, especially on the down hills.  Other tips, take walking poles with you and learn how to use them properly before you go, there is a technique!  They help immensely.  Train in the same gear that you will be wearing, especially with your footwear.  Buy a cheap poncho rain coat over there in addition to what you take.  We got stuck in the rain on day 2 and used them with our existing rain gear and they wear great, kept us warm and dry as it was freezing (we hiked it at the end of May).  When you train put some weight in your pack to replicate what you will be carrying.  I found that the training I did was adequate, even though I had to walk the trail with tendonitis in the arch of my foot (developed during the training lead up) and had a head cold during the whole hike after catching it on the plane on the way over.  I found the hike quite comfortable and enjoyable.  Of course the dreaded Day 2 over Dead Womans Pass was a challenge but I kept reminding myself of the old saying 'How do you eat an elephant?'  One bite at a time.  Same with the Inca Trail, one step at a time.  It's not a race, take your time, enjoy the beauty around you and pat yourself on the back after completing this experience of a lifetime!"
"Did the 1 day trek from km 104 to the Sun Gate. The only way to visit Winay Wayna. Awesome trail, incredible feeling when finally in view of Machu Picchu from Inti Punku. An experienced guide will take you back to the 16th century. Highly recommended."
"Took the family on a week long visit to Peru, flying into Lima from our home in Miami on Avainca. This trip's highlight was a one-day Inca Trail adventure, from the train tracks at mile marker ?? up the switchbacks to join the Inca Trail in Winaywayna, then on through the Sun Gate to Machu Piccu. Although Adios Travel would handle all of the arrangements from Lima/back to Lima, I had already booked most of the flights and hotels. They were able to work with the arrangements I had already made, added city tours, a great day of mountain biking, and the Inca Trail/Machu Piccu tours."
Great 4 days your and the machu Picchu was amazing. The Guid Roger was very friendly and helpfull. Recommend this tour!
"This was the end of my South America trip and the highlight, 5 days of pure adventure, culture and nature. I was prepared, at least I thought so, but the stairs were a killer. But Joel was an incredible guide who always walked last with our small group, motivating us to not stop but go on. The camping was warm, even if outside the weather was freezy. Also the hot coca tea helped to stay warm and altitude-sickness free. Considering the organization, it could not have been better, and Alex, a heavy guy, made it too. The view down to the Machu Picchu is precious, there's nothing that can exchange the feeling I've had here, and exploorperu did an incredible job with that hike. But the same goes for the alternative Rainbow Mountain, as I did not want to hike 3-4 hours and they had only about 1 hour. A gorgeous place and view. My legs start to hurt when I think of the entire trek, even after 3 weeks, but all of that was so worth it! Places you have to see."
"We are not avid trekkers but this was the best outdoors experience of our lives. We booked our trek through Uncover Latin America, and they were unreal. We had our trek organized by Chris in the office, very easy to talk to and well organized. Our guide Natalia was great, had a gregarious nature and made sure the group was all having a fantastic time. Food great and the trek incredible. Hire some walking sticks, they are an essential item, your walking on uneven stone paths and an extra support of a hiking stick will come in handy. Bring enough water to get you through until lunch time on the first day. A 1.5 litre will be enough. From then on at each meal break the cooks will fill up your water bottles with boiled water. Water and drinks are sold along the way also at various points. Carry plenty of soles with you to buy drinks and odd bits along the way. You will need to pay a tip on the last evening to the guides and porters. Bring suncreen, mozzie spray, toilet paper and baby wipes (very handy). We hired a toilet tent, glad we did the public toilets are not great. Had lunch at the Sanctuary lodge on the last day at Machu Picchu arranged by Uncover Latin America, nice touch to finish off an awesome trekking experience."
Did the Inca trail in December 2010 for my 60th birthday. Lifetime experience. Two excellent guides accompanied us and the food that we were served 3 times a day was very tasty. All our baggage was carried and tents pitched by the porters who did an amazing job by carrying all equipment up the mountain . The trail was tough but one that I will never forget.
"After reading conflicting and vague information I decided to make the 1-day Inca Trail hike from KM104. Our group of four adults ranged from 56 to 71 years of age and we all lived in lower altitudes and were in good health.  We had a range of beginner to experienced hikers.   Two members of our party were former military pilots who had received survival training and were the intermediate to experienced hikers.  If you subscribe to the definition of a pilgrimage being ""a long journey to a sacred place"" then the Inca Trail from KM104 is for you!  The books we read prior to the trip said the distance from KM104 to Manchu Picchu was 5.6 miles – we tracked our journey on two devices at 7.19 miles, climbed from 6000' to 9240', and required 33,000 steps.  It took 8 hours and 45 minutes.  Two marathon runners who train at altitude made the same trek the next day in 4 hours and 30 minutes but ran the first half of their hike.  The trail maps make it look like gradual up and then down which we learned are simply a straight line from one elevation to the next and NOT an indication of the trail.  There were many ups and downs in between.  The elevation changes are made through a series of uneven, stone steps that are irregular in size and shape with some stair step depths being extremely narrow (3-4"") and many of the steps being 16-20"" high. Walking poles are a must and while others in our party only used one pole I used two and found them to be extremely helpful as it allowed me to position some of the weight into my shoulders and arms when moving up and down large steps.  The trail averages 30-48"" wide and is consistently uneven.  You must pay attention so that you don’t trip or fall.  There are a couple of challenges with the trek: Unknowns, altitude, bathrooms, and heights. You have to pack for the unknowns such as weather.  While I was prepared for rain and chilly temperatures our hike was in full sun and 80 degree temperatures (which our guide said was extremely hot).  We could not have known the weather in advance - you have to go prepared for the unknown.  Unless you've been training at altitude get ready to have to stop frequently to catch your breath.  While our guide carried oxygen for emergencies we were never offered it and frankly never reached a point where we HAD to have it. The trail is cut into the side of mountain and there is NO place to pull off and privately use the bathroom.  The only bathroom is located at the Trekker's Hotel (approximately 4-5 hours into our hike) and it is a private hole in the ground.  I packed a Freshette but there was no place to use it on the trail and I did not practice with it before leaving home which was a mistake that I learned at the Trekker's Hotel!  As ridiculous as it sounds I would recommend wearing Depends (adult diapers) so that you can go when you need to and then change your ""diaper"" at the Trekker's Hotel (placing your soiled diaper in a Zip Lock bag to bring down).  Yes, the trail is built into the side of mountains so if you are afraid of heights I would not recommend this trek.  Most of the time there is sufficient vegetation to block your view of the height but there are exposed places along the trail where you are aware of the height and the dangerous edge that you are walking along.  Llama's have the right of way!  Yes, there are wild Llamas on the trek and you must allow them to pass you.  The typical llama that we passed required approximately 18-24"" of the path (and they can kick if upset) and so creating enough space for them to pass is no small feat.  Key success factors: Weather, your guide, equipment, physical training prior to the trip, rest when you can, stay hydrated, and eat.  If it is raining DO NOT make the trek as the rocks are slippery even when dry.  Your guide is critical to the hike's success. Guides are required to have a certification that includes emergency and survival skills.  In addition, they are required to carry emergency supplies.  Our guide's pack weighed 30 pounds. Proper, well broken in equipment is critical.  I debated about hiking boots or shoes and ended up wearing hiking shoes with my usual orthotic insert and they worked extremely well.  I even did my pre-trip training in the hiking shoes.  If you have weak ankles you should wear hiking boots and braces for weak knees (the hiking down takes a toll on the knees).  I would also strongly encourage you to get a backpack that sits on the hips and does not hang from your shoulders.  In addition to two poles, I would also recommend placing a flashlight in your backpack in case you get stuck on the mountain past dark (due to an emergency). Physical training/conditioning is necessary – I did 30-minutes of interval cardio five days a week and worked with a trainer on strength training two hours/week for six months prior to departure – this was essential!  I could have trained more but physically I had what was needed for the trek and had no soreness the morning after the hike.  There are 5 to 6 places designed for you to sit down and rest - take advantage of those.  Be sure to take your backpack off at every opportunity and really rest, hydrate, and eat a small snack.  Our guide recommended that we bring 1 liter of water but we carried an additional 2 liters per person (there is NO purified water along the trail) and we found that 3-4 liters (adding sugar free electrolytes) was the right amount of water per person.  If you don't want to carry that much water in your backpack consider taking a water filtration kit (there is a waterfall about 2/5s of the way into the hike).  Due to the inability to use the bathroom along the trail the tendency was to get de-hydrated.  And, unlike daily life in which you may push yourself to keep going even if you are hungry you CAN NOT do that on this trek.  Every time you have a break you MUST eat a small snack (banana or energy bar) because it helps your legs to remain steady.  The night before the hike I would recommend no drinking of any alcohol nor having any coffee the morning of the hike as they are de-hydrating.  It's also important to eat a protein dense breakfast the day of the hike with some carbohydrates.  What if an emergency occurs?  There is no helicopter rescue.  If someone has an emergency and needs to come down off of the mountain they have to be carried out on a stretcher.  This requires that the rescue team hike up to where you are and then carry you back down on a stretcher.  This will require hours and possibly result in you being on the mountain after sunset.  Other issues that make this trip unique: The altitude can rob you of your trip and the logistics are not easy.  I would NOT fly into Lima and head to Manchu Picchu in the first day or two.  Instead, give yourself time to acclimate in Cuzco and/or the Sacred Valley for several days prior to hiking.  I also got a prescription for altitude sickness and took it as insurance so that I would not have any down time on a once in a lifetime trip.  Regarding the logistics: in order to visit Manchu Picchu you have to go to Ollantaytambo (a small hikers village with lots of hostels) and catch a train to Pueblo Manchu Picchu where you catch a bus to take a 30-minute ride up switch-back roads to the ticketing entrance to Manchu Picchu.  Tickets for the train and the bus (both directions) have to be purchased in advance. The line to catch the bus to come back to Pueblo Manchu Picchu from Manchu Picchu average one-hour in length but get shorter as the day gets later.  However, they do stop running around 5 or 6PM which is why I would recommend starting the KM104 trek as early as possible so that you don't miss the last bus down nor have to rush to make the last bus and thereby increase the risk of falling or spraining an ankle.  If you miss the last bus you have a 1-hour hike down into Pueblo Manchu Picchu and after 7 miles of hiking you simply don't want to have to do this!  We did the KM104 hike on our way into Pueblo Manchu Picchu which created a meaningful logical issue: what to do with our remaining luggage?  Fortunately, one of our party chose not to make the hike and remained with our luggage on the train which we paid additional money to be able to do.  But the promised porters to help her once she arrived into Pueblo Manchu Picchu did not materialize and our luggage could have remained on the train to who knows where if she had not been there to get it unloaded.  For this reason, I would recommend traveling with your luggage into Pueblo Manchu Picchu (unless you have a personal escort who you trust with your luggage) and settling into your hotel on the first day and do the KM104 Inca Trail hike on day two.  Also, all five people in our party only packed European carryon luggage size bags. The space on the train is limited and you have to reserve your space by your luggage dimensions.  Bottom line, find a tour operator who is an EXPERT on Manchu Picchu and use them to book everything.  Here’s what I wore for the one day hike (which was in full sun and a temperature of 80 degrees):  Wicking under shirt (which I removed at the Trekker's Hotel); cotton tunic shirt; black jeans; hiking shoes with good socks; baseball cap; and sunglasses.  I also used two walking sticks. In my backpack: A windbreaker; cashmere sweater; plastic rain poncho with a hood; gloves; Chapstick; i-phone; mosquito spray; sunscreen; energy food; 3 liters of water; hand wipes/sanitizer; toilet paper; and two zip lock bags for trash.  We had a serious photographer on our hike who later said, ""DO NOT pack a large camera for the hike"" and suggested that photographers use a small camera or phone to take photos due to the added weight. Am I glad that I made the KM104 pilgrimage?  YES!  The experience of coming through the Sungate and looking down onto Manchu Picchu was glorious. We toured Manchu Picchu the next day with several thousand tourists and it made me even more grateful that we had authentically experienced the Inca Trail with a few other hikers who became friends along the way."
