area where there isn't any self guidance provided or nothing much to view.  Hyped up lot so not worth a visit. still if want to explore the height and surroundings there may 
Be ready to climb up quite a few stairs if you want to go there but you wont regret it.  the highest point of Aravalis is worth a visit.  
Good place to visit. At height. Need to climb about 500 plus steps to reach. Good scenic beauty. Amazing scenes of natural beauty. Will see clouds going below from the top.
"If you are in Abu and you don't give this place a visit, you have committed a big mistake.  It is a must visit place for nature lovers. Take your car along if you love to ride and you feel comfortable on hilly roads.  You will love the view from here. It is the highest point of…"
"Reach early around 800-900 am if you want to beat the crowds and traffic jams .The temple itself is clean and a small one.The highest point although is not the temple,it is the site where the foot impressions of god Trimurti are found and quite higher. The whole of Mount Abu can…"
Great view of the hills around. There is a temple in the cave. Walk up a flight of stairs will give you 360 view. Drive up to this place is also scenic.  
This is the highest point of the aravallis. Have to climb lots of stairs. Not for elderly. Palkis are available and charge 780 per head. Lots of small shops on the way. Every item is priced steeply. Two temples are on the way. Good views from the top 
This place has a religious significance. You need to climb some 200+ steps. Parking is not upto the mark here. You get awesome view from this place. Do take Binoculars along with you to enjoy this place
"This is quite far from the city area. Not sure how much private vehicle charges. Try to come with own vehicle, driving to this point is fun. Great roads and great views. Must go to the top of mountain you see great views. "
"different experience  for about 80to 100 steps of stairs on arrival  some local people with ""DOLI"" available in pick season of tourist for the senior citizen who cannot go up on their own .A small cave temple and big bell for your wishes to come true. enjoy the Raw mangoes and…"
"Mount Abu and guru shikhar are not that big hill station.  One need to follow usual hill rules while driving, which means no cutting lanes. Rest is good.  I visited in July 17,  was disappointed as  it was cloudy and no visibility,  bit overcrowded,  wind was awesome after twice…"
"This Deity Datta Shrine needs strong knees to climb ! The elderly have the option of coolies carrying you in a 'jhoola'. What is most striking other than its spiritual value, is the vast panoramic scenery around you. Spend atleast an hour at the top. Reach before 4 pm."
"You need to climb around 400 steps. Car will go only to certain distance. Climbing all the way up to the top, where Guru Padukas are kept is a good experience. Climbing is not very difficult for average healthy person. Carriers (Dolis) are also available"
"This place is some distance from the main town of Mount Abu - but since there arent a lot of things to do in Mount Abu, i am sure everyone makes a trip to this place.  Is it worth the travel? The travel to this place is better than the place itself - if you ask me. The road is…"
"Crowded, not recommended for people looking for mountain meditation. But it is a scenic beauty , so a must visit place."
"It is an easy climb to Guru Shikhar. Nice all round views, especially of the near by observatory. Avoid noons."
"Sweat it out and see the temple and the view of the town. Get a guide to know the history, and let some local folks earn the 100-200rs which otherwise you'd spend on a beer or coffee in the city.   Refresh yourself with some tea and snacks post the descent. And be ready to hear…"
There are good views from the top - apart from that there isn't anything else. Considering the number of steps one has to climb - it is a huge disappointment once you reach the top. Obviously entire way up is highly commercialised.
I again visited the place with my friends. This time I made it all the to the top. It's a long way up which requires a lot of climbing. But it is totally worth it. The view is so beautiful I have no words to describe it. Spend an hour up there and you will return relaxed.  This…
"Guru shikar is a nice serene and lonely place , drive just away from temple on the road to observatory and enjoy scenic beauty of forest and hills u can observe bears roaming around freely. The games of clouds with hilltops and breeze of hills. Sit on any stone and meditation for hours, different sheds of blue mountain lines to greener sheds of forest with rock spots.Drive to mount abu Nakki lake is too crowded and tod rock loose it's attraction ,go beyond nakki lake to honeymoon point ,small road leads to most attractive pointHoneymoon point is last point of hill range and best to enjoy sunset. Must visit at sunset time"
This is a best place to see the sun set. Good view of the city and lake. Come here again sour. Highly recommended.....
Apparently the highest/tallest geological point in the state. Offers some decent views - views would be better if the surrounding hills were green. Has a couple of temples for the religiously inclined. 
"It's like a top of mount abut, best view from top. having more than 100 stairs to climb so be ready for some exercise... also roads are bit curvy so be careful while driving...   best time to reach will be bit early morning.."
It is a place to worship and pleasant atmosphere uphill. However the place misses basic amenities like toilet. Rest it's fine.
Further down the same road beyond Dilwara. Makes sense to combine the two if you are staying in town.
"The most coveted place in Mt Abu we were very excited after hearing so much about itand we were not disappointed.  As we climbed mild showers started and it was lush green everywhere The peak offered spectacular views amidst the mist. Boiled corn, fruits & masala maggi is what u can devour on the way and on the top. Definitely worth the time and effort Also a good place to collect souvenirs or gifts if you intend to buy them"
There is an ISRO observatory tucked away close to Guru Shikhar. Makes for an excellent twilight drive and just gazing at the stark landscape from a height. A must visit in Mount Abu.
Its a tough walk uphill for elderly people though there is a facility of being carried on PALKI. Views are great. Enjoy the cool breeze when you are uphill.
"Guru shikhar....one of the highest peak in Aravali mountain ranges. The mandir 'Guru datta'....is located on the peak and one has to climb about 300 stairs to visit the temple. The mandir is about Lord Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. Do take a guide (will cost about Rs 350) as they…"
"It’s a good place to visit. Try to start journey as early morning as you can. Once sun is in it’s full mood, you may hear the music.Baggi is available for children and elder people"
Top most spot in Mount Abu. Climbed more than 1000 steps. Can view entire mount abu from here. Enjoyed.
Situated on the hill top this place provides a view of lifetime and must visit location. Being a bit crowdy with lot shopkeepers bugging despite a must visit place
Guru shikhar is at height. Having so many stairs. Palki is available for needed people. Scenic beauty is awesome 
"Surrounding view is pretty good but like many other view points in Mount Abu this place also does not hold much. Need to trek up if you have parked your vehicle down - far behind the main point, which is true in most of the cases due to crowded parking up on the hill and…"
The temple is historical. Inside natural cave . Liked the view points from top of Guru Shikhar. An artist who makes name plates key rings etc is really too good. From top you get some exotic pictures of the whole range and abu city too.
