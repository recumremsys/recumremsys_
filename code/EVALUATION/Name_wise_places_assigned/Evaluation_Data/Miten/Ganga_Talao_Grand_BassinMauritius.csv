Visited here on a tour of the south of Mauritius.  There were a lot of people there praying etc so felt it was wrong to take photos. Our guide explained to us all about the different gods and their significance which we found very interesting. We also walked up to the viewpoint which has great views of the area and surrounding areas although this was a bit of a trek up the hill to those who aren’t very fit!Would recommend to others if touring the south of the country.
Visited the Ganga Talao on the 23rd November 2017.  Absolutely beautiful place and a must visit in Mauritius.Priest was very accommodating at the temple.
"Has loads of temples with different Hindu gods around a lake. Its a must visit if you believe in Hindu religion. Place around it it very good . We combined the visit with Seven Colored sands, Victoria falls & charmel. Loads of natural parks around the route "
"Was quite mesmerised by looking all Indian gods at one place. The place is so spiritual having Lord Shiva’s only linga outside India and also having shrines of other Hindu gods, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavira, etc."
"To appreciate this sight it helps to understand that hundreds of thousands of the Hindu faith walk to sight from all over the Island each February. This helps to explain the size of the site and the many seating areas around the extensive lake. The temple itself is relatively modest but visitors are welcome - with shoes left outside. There are some interesting shrines inside as well as shrines to specific Hindu Gods outside on the edge of the Lake. Overlooking the site is an enormous Statue of Shiva, a beacon to the faithful. It must be a spectacular sight during the pilgrimage but probably best viewed on TV rather than in person."
Visited Ganga talav and the various temples made in vicinity.. It was very peaceful and almost all common dieties that Indians worship are there. There is even a place to do havan. To go around the entire place in you should have some time and be ready to climb up and down. Otherwise you can just visit the temple at the base. Overall a very serene place
"Visited several times, seeking the blessing of the holy site. It gets very busy during the week long Shivarathri Festival. Seen the dedicated locals  that observe a fast and pull chariots that they have built and beautifully adorned themselves from their hometowns to the holy site.  Plenty of food stall at the site during the festivities. To appreciate the beauty of the lake and the little temples dotted around, it's best to visit after or before the Shivarathri period which is usually between February and March each year. The exact dates are based on the moon cycle, hence the change in dates each year. The new Shiva and Sakthi statues that flank the entrance are worth the visit. Very tranquil space."
"An interesting spot, I visited on a Sunday so many locals there praying and paying respect. Was a very tranquil and spiritual place, a few monkeys around the place and it was nice to see families and a variety of festive colours, better than your average temple."
The Grand Bassin is a holy lake for Mauritian of Hindu faith and the Hindus of Mauritius declared it a Holy lake. By the lake is a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and other Gods. Overlooking the lake is the statue of Mangal Mahadev (Shiva statue) which is of 33 meters (the highest statue in Mauritius).
Being an indian I wanted to visit this place. Pond surrounded by templates and felt true inner peace.
Grest place to go! Specially now as Maha Shivratri is about to start so the preparations and decorations is worth looking for. Apart the view is spectacular! Get the positive vibes and the spiritual feeling is very intriguing as one would feel surrounded by god's eternity
Went there on the 1st of Jan. Was a bit crowded. Clean place. Lots of temples to do prayers. Relaxing moments.
Popular tourist attraction and prayer site for locals. The foggy weather builds up an atmosphere. Hiking up the hill is a plus to get a panoramic view and for photos.
"Considered an incarnation of Ganges in Mauritius, local Mauritian Hindus consider this lake holy and take annual pilgrimage during the 'night of Shiva' (Shiva-ratri). The lake is teeming with fishes and life and surrounding the lake are dozen or so temples of various deities in Hindu panteon including those of Buddhists and Jains."
A place of deep spiritual value of you are Hindu. Even if you are not of you get there early there is a definite feeling of other worldlyness. Get there when it is busy and it's like any other tourist sight. Would not go there just for this but as part of a visit to the central Highlands
one of the best things that you can see in Mauritius. being an Indian you must visit there. There is a temple of lord Shiva and its 13 jyotirlinga there. Two amazing tall status of Shiva and maa durga are there at the entrance.
Very impressive statues of Hindu gods . Make sure to go with someone who has knowledge about the Hindu faith who can tell you stories about all the different gods. It makes the visit so much more interesting.
So we are driving to the black gorge and nature reserve and it was suggested we pass through Ganga Talao to see the Hindu Temples.  The scenery in the area was like a lush rainforest.  There is a large highway heading into this area and what a surprise is waiting when you drive toward two huge Hindu Gods.  The shear size of the gods truly makes you say WOW!  Knowing nothing about the area it became apparent that this is an area of pilgrimage for the Hindu faith.  There were able parking facilities.  Beautiful brightly coloured temples and statues surrounding a large lake.  There are monkeys at the main pink temple but they don’t bother you as they are feed fruits so nice to take photos.  The place is such a surprise in the middle of a nature reserve.  Plenty of public bathrooms/toilets too. Well worth the visit.
"Ganga Talao literally means Ganga Tank. There is a serene  lake/tank where the temple is situated. Most Hindu temples have a large water body -- a tank --- next to them. And since River Ganga is a sacred water body for the Hindus, this tank has been named after the Ganga. As soon as you enter the area you notice two giant holy idols before you. Goddess Durga and Lord Shiva. They are both over a 100 feet tall, made out of solid concrete and steel. The Shiva icon is easily the tallest in Mauritius, and may be one of the biggest Hindu Shiva statues in the world. Further down is the Shiva Temple itself, on the banks of the serene lake/tank. Our taxi driver (a faithful Hindu) advised us not to go inside, because we had not taken the ritual bath and observed fasting or other rituals. Being Hindus ourselves, we did not want to disrespect local customs,  so we sought divine blessings from outside.I am not sure if this ritual was a strictly enforced mandate or a just a tradition; but we believed that it is best to follow local customs wherever we go. You could check with a local before you visit the temple.On the other side of the lake is a ""Spiritual Park"" which not only has Shiva, but also other Deities like Hanuman, Gayatri, Rama and so on. There was also an idol of Sri Mahavira who is greatly venerated by people belonging to the Jain Religion and Shirdi SaiBaba, a Sufi spiritual leader worshiped by both Hindus and Muslims. In that sense the Spiritual Park was truly eclectic.  People of all religions come here.We visited Ganga Talao on a weekday, and this was just few days after the celebration of an important Hindu festival called Maha Sivaratri. So the Ganga Talao was empty and we had a peaceful visit. I was told that on festival days there are huge crowds and there is hardly standing room in the temples. The Gods were kind to us, but it would be best to check with a local, so that you avoid crowded periods."
I wasn't too bothered about visiting here as I'd seen many temples in India. However the taxi driver suggested we should stop and take a look - so glad we did. Down from the impressive statues one can wander around the fish filled lake and relax - watching the monkey doing their things and generally taking everything in. Enjoy...
"Visited this beautiful temple with our driver for the day. What a tranquil spiritual place, truly awe inspiring."
"Loved this, from the giant statues on entry to monkeys, lake and temple. Dress appropriately, even though lots of tourists don't. We visited on a Sunday when lots of Hindus were leaving offerings, which added to the atmosphere,l. We didn't enter the actual temple as we didn't want to intrude"
this was one of the best places in mauritius. i love it very much. it is calm and peaceful. have a lot of people. it is unique temple on the lake. great temple.
"Before even arriving, it was amazing to see how really big the statues of Lord Shiva and Lord Durga were. Seeing them in pictures does not prepare you for how huge they are. My kids have never experienced anything other than a Christian church so they had an opportunity to learn while watching some of the locals attend and give offerings. Unfortunately it was very, very wet and misty so the views of the lake were not as clear as they would normally be, however this maybe even added to the atomospher at the end of the day. One must just remember that while this is one of the major tourist attractions, it is still a sacred place to others and this needs to be respected."
"From the two giant statues, to the the lakeside temples to the plethora of Hindu iconography you cannot be anything other than impressed and even if you have no particular interest in the religion itself it is a place that will bring a smile to your face and that can't be a bad thing. Go gawp."
Spiritually uplifting. Was most enthralled by the beauty of the nearby temples and shrines.  Will definitely re visit.
Bowled over by the statues of the Hindu gods just above the lake.  Our guide was very good at explaining the significance of each of the Hindu gods and the stories attached to each one.  A must place to visit.
We visited as part of our wild south tour with mautourco and we had a guide who was Hindu.It was great to see the statues and visit the lake. Learning about the gods at the same time.Great to see lots of monkeys walking around also.
Visit Grand Bassin in the morning. It was calm and full of Blessings. When we drove through we saw the big statues of Mangal Mahadeva and Durga Maa. Then we went to the crater lake and also visit the big temple by the lake then walk up the top of the hill. You can see an amazing view of the crater lake itself. In the way out we saw another beautiful temple with 108 Shivlings. It was amazing. There were loads of monkeys and the devotees were feeding them. A place I would recommend everyone to visit. Take with you a pure heart and you will feel the blessings there!
"Had a car for three days and this was on the ""to do"" list. We are not religious at all but its always good to go and broaden your horizons. The weather wasnt particularly good on the afternoon we visited , its quite high above sea level and probably best visited in the morning before the cloud and drizzle move in. Extremely peaceful and tranquil place. Both of the idols are huge and not something you will ever see in the uk. Had a nice walk around the lake and in the temples, just remember its respectful to remove your shoes! Take some bananas or fruit to feed the monkeys near the idols of Lord Shiva and Maa Durga. There is no admission fee and you can walk around the whole area for free, there are no refreshment facilities that we could find so make sure you have some water with you and food if you need it. The only bad thing to say is that the toilets are disgusting, make sure you take some sanitising gel with you to wash your hands with!"
"I first visited Grand Bassin/Ganga Talao in 2000 a few days after getting married, and I've been back on almost every visit to Mauritius since then. It has developed quite a lot, with more statues and shrines, plus of course the two huge statues of Lord Shiva and Durga at the entrance to the holy area. Since my last visit in 2015, the management of the Grand Bassin has improved - the grass was cut, shrubs trimmed and everything kept admirably clean - apart from the toilets, my wife said, where there was no paper, no soap, no towels (you have been warned!). Do take the time, if you can, to walk up the small hill to the Hanuman temple; it's not a taxing climb as there are easy steps and handrails both sides. Potentially, it gives you a wonderful view over the lake and all the way out to the coast. I say 'potentially' because Grand Bassin is not renowned for bight, clear skies - it's often grey and misty, if not actually in the midst of a downpour. To my mind, that all adds to its rather special atmosphere. In Mauritius, your clothes dry off quickly, so why worry? Talking of clothes, the only jarring note were tourists wearing inappropriate clothes at this holy site. Whether or not you have any religious belief yourself, you should have the courtesy to respect those who do. It's not a beach, so please don't go there in shorts and crop-tops. It does, though, make sense to wear shoes that you can slip on and off easily, as you'll need to remove shoes if you enter any of the temples. I found it easier simply to walk barefoot because you can get a better grip. And the textured bricks used for the paths actually give quite a nice sensation when you walk on them.If you're wondering about the huge road leading up to this rather remote rural location, that's because Grand Bassin is the destination for thousands of pilgrims during Maha Shivratri (the next pilgrimage will be on 4 March 2019). It's all a big contrast from what it must have been like back in 1897 when the lake was 'discovered' as a holy site."
"Visited as part of a tour of the south of the island. Unfortunately the heavens opened as we arrived, and so we did not spend much time here. Very busy, with many large statues. Probably would have given a higher rating if weather had been better."
I loved the super sized God statues.  With the clouds moving in the background it felt like the statuses were moving.  The energy and vibration was high.  There are many traditions and folk stories about its origin.  We made offerings to the Gods and said prayers. The priest on site was welcoming.  Our guide even got us to make a wish and throw a coin into the basin.  The tranquil sounding are great for meditation and yoga. Watch out for the monkeys.  They were enjoying terrorising the visitors for their fruit and food offerings.
"I'm not religious at all, but have a keen interest in learning about other cultures and religions.  So despite the nay-sayers who think this place is not worth visiting, it most certainly is, providing you have a guide who can explain the idols to you, who can give you a bit of background on the religion.It is what it is, a religious prayer facility with thousands making there way there to pray every day, so expect it to not be pristine and clean, do not expect sculptures worthy of Michaelangelo's David or the Venus de Milo.  Go with the right attitude and heart, and appreciate that this may not be your ""thing"" but go to learn, go to absorb how the Mauritians spend their time in prayer, go to drink in the sights and sounds of something not Western.Go with an open mind.We found it fascinating and enlightening, even though as said, I'm not religious at all."
"We pulled over on a whim to see what this body of water that we were passing was, and I'm glad we did. A large body of water with little stands for people to give offerings of some kind. Walked past about 5 groups of people burning incense and feeding fish. Spotted four stray cats and a couple dogs along the way. Fish danced at the top of the water. The cats looked very well fed, and I watched as one watched a school of the fish by the shore very intensely. I speculate they eat the fish. Even though the day was gloomy it was an immersive and lovely experience."
