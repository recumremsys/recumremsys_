"A great museum in memory of the terrible consequences of the atomic bomb. A must visit if you are staying in Hiroshima. It is an important reminder of the cruel incident that happened. May it never happen again. Mind you a visit here can be very emotional and I reccomend to go see it with a friend/familymember/partner. Outside the Peace Memorial Museum, there is an open space with a peaceful pond where a flame is burning for peace on earth. Another memorial is dedicated to the children who died in the bombing, Childrens Peace Monument, symbolized by Sadaki Sasaki (reccomend to read her story)."
Very clearly exhibits the tragedies of war.  Allow several hours for this museum if you want to read all the posted stories.  Definitely need to rent the audio guide.
Very dramatic and realistic details of what occurred when the atomic bomb was dropped. Well presented.200 yen entry. Hop on hop off bus drops u right outside.Definitely worth a visit.
"When visiting Hiroshima, the Peace Memorial Museum is one of the must do museums. We made the mistake of not getting an audio guide and felt as though we missed out. We weirdly couldn’t go back to purchase it, so if you’re keen on the stories behind the items, you definitely want to get an audio guide. The museum is great and has information cards, so it’s still informative without the audio guides. It’s very easy to follow the directions and the museum is in a nice big open area, so you won’t feel over crowded. The entry fee without audio guides were ¥200 per person. If you’re into these museums, which we are, plan for around 3 hours if you want to view everything including listening to the videos with a very leisurely stroll. Be prepared to leave a little emotional after hearing the stories and seeing the items. We certainly felt as though it offered value  and would definitely recommend it."
"The museum is a strong reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons. The main exhibit focuses on the bombing of August 6th, 1945 and the effect on the people of Hiroshima. Which was horrible. Be aware that the exhibit can evoke strong emotions with photos and portrayals of the aftermath of the bombing. The exhibit was very well laid out, with no music, which added to the seriousness of the items on display. I strongly recommend to go here to get some insight into the event that most people think about when they hear the city's name."
This museum give a human face to the tragedy of the atomic bomb. Reading first hand accounts of this event was very impactful.
This is a must place in Hiroshima. Prepare to be touched by the horrific personal stories of victims and relatives of the first atomic bombing.
"This museum is a critical part of Hiroshima and not to be missed.  Even our teenage boys who are unimpressed with everything put down their cell phones long enough to immerse themselves in the exhibits.  Personally, I am so touched and impressed by the resiliency of this city and its people to rise from the ashes and build this museum by the early 1950s.  War is devestating, and yet Hiroshima rebuilt and its people will never forget.  You can do this museum in about an hour.  But definitely take time to see various part of the Memorial Park.   Things to note:  If your children are 14 or under, they get in free.  And while it was suggested to us to get the audio guides, they are NOT necessary.  Everything you hear is written out in English throughout.  And finally at end of exhibits, there's a peace petition that you can fill out that will be taken to the U.N. (or something like that).  Makes you feel like you're a part of something bigger."
"The museum is well presented.  Be prepared, it's graphic.  The museum has a wonderful map of Hiroshima which details the before, during and after of the bombing in scale.  After watching the map, you understand exactly how things occurred and what everything was like before and after.  Once you check the map out you enter the exhibits that show the human side."
This is a place you must go to when you visit Hiroshima. It is very crowded from 10:00 to 15:00. Full of students on school excursions. It is recommended to go to 8:30 or 16:00. Don't forget Please look at the exhibition room on the first basement. This place appeals to never cause the tragedy of Hiroshima again. I realize that nuclear weapons don't let you die like humans.広島を訪れたら行かなければならない場所です。10時から15時は大変混雑します。修学旅行の学生で溢れます。8時30分または16時に行くことをお勧めします。忘れずに地下一階の展示室も観てください。この場所は、二度と広島の悲劇が起こらないよう訴えます。核兵器は人間として死なせてくれないことを実感します。
The Museum is sited in the Peace Park in Hiroshima together with a range of other memorials.Unfortunately when we visited the Museum parts of it were closed for renovation. The section we visited was very crowded with crowds several people deep near some of the exhibits.We sat and watched several of the video clips from Hiroshima survivors and found them to be very moving. Hearing from actual victims and witnesses gave us a good understanding of the trauma and devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima. Seeing artefacts and photographs of the event gave us a clear understanding of the damage caused.When one is removed in time and place from an historical event one is sort of ho hum but when one visits such a site as this museum one gains an understanding of the event and and empathy for the victims. Although visiting such a site is not fun it is an educative experience that is an important of travel and should not be avoided. A visit to Hiroshima would not be complete without a visit to this museum.
Well worth the visit to truly understand the impact of the nuclear bomb. Was very busy which meant it could be a bit slow to move through but the exhibition was very well done. It was good value too.
"I found Hiroshima to be a beautiful city! But as we entered the peace park to head to the memorial, as beautiful as it is, it feels heavy.. the whole area still has a sadness about it that is palpable. On entering the museum you are immersed straight away by walking into a circular room with floor to ceiling images of the destroyed city right round you, it is a hard hitting start. From then you see testimonials and the haunting art made by survivors. The burned/melted objects and clothes. The children’s possessions. I found it heartbreaking and was moved to tears very early on, I found it a difficult experience but one I think everyone should have. Many reviewers say this museum plays the ‘victim card’ and is propaganda.. Yes there is very little mentioned about the Japanese military actions before this atrocity, and yes it does make Japan appear an innocent nation minding its business when suddenly attacked without warning.. BUT!! THIS. STILL. HAPPENED. To civilians, women, children. Horrific hideous things that lasted for many years. Look at it as a museum about the effects of the a-bomb on the people.. and pray to whatever god you believe in that it wont happen to you!"
"This museum is a harrowing experience. It is about the effectof the A bomb. It is seen through the personal impact on people's lives, their families and the longer term impact on individuals and their families. Seen from this perspective the museum is excellent in achieving what it sets out to achieve. That we  must never use such weapons again on civilian populations  There is some context about the war, the Japanese aggression in South East Asia, but this falls short on historical detail about the rationale for the bomb. That is how it should be as that is not the purpose of the museum......"
Good and short visit. All enjoyed it. Especially the the Shinkasen ride from Osaka. Advise to visit in the day time.
When visiting Hiroshima this museum is a must. The stories told are powerful and moving. There are many personal items on view which add to the overal experience. Don’t miss it!!!
"Go and see. Yes it's a dark place but it happened. The A-bomb drawings by survivors were so moving. There were no cameras at the time,  so survivors were asked to draw what they remembered. Very powerful and heart wrenching. The museum is dedicated to not repeating history.  Questions from survivors evoke Holocaust questions, e.g. ""Why am I still alive? It must be to tell what happened."""
"The museum houses a stunning collection of artifacts associated with the bombing of Hiroshima, and the devastating aftermath. Parts of it may be difficult to go through because the museum doesn't shy away from showing how the blast directly affected the human body. And if you are an American, please don't be ""that guy"" loudly arguing to your companions that ""it had to be done in the interest of the greater good"". I found it extremely distasteful to bring that up while surrounded by evidence of so much suffering, pain, and death. Don't be that Ugly American stereotype!"
This museum very effectively relays the human aspect of the Atomic Bomb by giving they innocent victims a voice.  Hear their stories to really understand the impact. Confronting experience but a must do while in Japan
Visiting the museum was a powerful experience. Definitely a place I would recommend to anyone visiting Japan.
"The Peace Memorial Museum is definitely a must-see in Japan, and much can be learnt from the displays. It's a humbling place which captures the horror of nuclear warfare and also details the sequence of events leading to deployment from the Allies.That said, if I had to go again, I would give the following advice to myself.1. Don't take the audio guide. It's not very expensive, but I felt that it didn't add much. The narrators voice reads the first few lines from the display, and sometimes adds a bit more detail, but hardly much to engage on. If you're a quick reader you're better off skipping this to engage with the text and visuals more, without the distracting audio2. Don't go to the survivor's memorial lecture. I'm not sure what the exact name is, but it's an English presentation of about 45min in which a lady whose mother and schoolteacher survived the A-bomb detail their stories. I felt like I would rather have spent the time going slower through the museum then listening to the stories3. If you can (museum personnel might be a bit directive and force you to go the other way) I would start with the history leading up to the deployment, and then go to through the after effects area. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of these sections, but I do know that the normal flow of the museum is against this recommendation. I suppose it's all a matter of personal opinion."
"on my husband's wish list to see when we returned to japan as a tourist rather than for work. took the Shinkansen from tokyo, about 4 hours with one change. checked into the candeo hotel and walked here, not that far away. a lovely warm autumn day. bought sandwiches along the way and sat on the river bank to eat our lunch. crossed the bridge and looked back at the a bomb dome which we visited later. stopped at the children's peace monument with the cranes. walked along the centre of the peace park and passed and stopped at the cenotaph and the eternal flame. not too busy in the park. entered and paid at the main building of the museum, an attractive, low, long building. one is directed with signs as to where and how to enter. very busy. very quiet. all the exhibitions are terribly heart wrenching, especially the children memories. hard to read all of it. i believe we went through the east building also. looking outside, there were many groups of school children arriving. after, we welcomed walking through the park to continue on our day."
"After you’ve done the peace park you must not miss the museum. The peace park gives you a flavour of what happened here in 1945. The museum gives you a fuller, more frank and sobering experience. Be warned it is upsetting. However what’s the point in shielding yourself from the realities of what went on here. Feel it and pass it on so that it may never happen again. Many people were in tears. There are lots of personal accounts and stories of families losing children, Mothers, Fathers, Brothers & Sisters."
"We wanted to know more about the bombing and this was perfect. Maps, a great video (personal survivor stories), mementos (clothing) and affecting stories of loss, bravery....not to be missed. Makes a definite argument for world peace (esp nuclear disarmament)."
Visited in June 2016 with my husband and brother. Difficult to see the scope of destruction and the horrible impact on so many lives. The videos were very descriptive and told the personal stories and accounts of many individuals. The artifacts from buildings and the domestic items and clothing (particularly from the children) was tear inducing. Everyone should visit to understand the impact of war and atomic weapons.
Visited recently on a trip with teens from Australia studying Japanese. This museum was so well put together. Its very hard to look at everything and not be effected. We spoke with a local later who advised the museum was not done for tourists but rather for the Japanese as a reminder of what war brings. I felt hearing that so lost for words and gained so much more respect for them.
A long way using shinkanshen train..i visit the hiroshima peace memorial. Started from the 1st floor just like read a story..and the sadness is getting higher especially when we saw several materials collected from the bom victim. This museum complex is really big and contain with several building which has different function..really sad to hear the stories during this tragedy..but the tragedy shall be our lesson for our future..not to be forgotten..
Very sad but historically accurate. Shows the suffering of the local community. Very reasonable 200 yen entry and 400 for an audio guide. Would recommend but can have gruesome and difficult imagery so be prepared.
"Visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum triggered lots of emotions and questions. It helps all the visitors to make a decision whether they would become a peacemaker or not and to reflect upon wars, arms, weapons and especially nuclear ones. It is essential to remember that war is not limited by space and that it can affect all the lives of various populations in many parts of the world. It also made us realize that the conservation of artifacts and historical items is important if you want to make history believable. Seeing the old clothes and glasses, fragments of buildings and other infrastructures and linking them to the written texts was a very complex process and helped us to become witnesses of the horror the Japanese people living in Hiroshima. The bad effects of the war on children were clearly demonstrated through the exhibition and this provoked an immense sadness. The view of thousands of paper cranes near the Sadako Sasaki statue would allow hope for a peaceful world. Thank you so much to those who have built this museum and rasembled all the historic items inside since you are allowing the world to know more about other aspects of World War II and about the resilience of the Japanese people."
Given the history of Hiroshima this museum is always going to be sobering but it was informative and unbiased. I would definitely recommend visiting but lots would be difficult for young children to see as there are many upsetting images.
Left this museum different to how I entered. Really interesting and amazing museum which everyone can take something from.
"Take your time and read everything. Listen to the video recordings of the survivors. Models of the two bombs are on view. Interestingly Nagasaki, a smaller city, was struck by a bigger bomb."
"Really great museum. It gets quite full, especially because many school classes come here as well, but if you go in the afternoon it is not as bad. There is so much to see so if you want to see (and read) everything you need more than three hours. Be prepared though that many images are quite graphic displaying all the horror that happened."
"Currently going through seismic upgrades. It does what museums are supposed to do.  Inform and provoke discussion. We took friends from China with us, who has heard of an atomic bomb but never understood the scope of damage and the horror inflicted.The children, five and eight year old, were wide-eyed throughout the exhibition.  I was concerned that it might frighten the children but it did not however it brought a torrent of questions about the incident. Caveat - discernment is needed whether children can cope with the photos.I was personally surprised at the amount of tears we saw among the visitors.This exhibit is done very well.  It personalizes the event, we feel empathy for the victims.  The exhibition is in Japanese and English.  There is an audio tour guide available for a fee, I am hesitant to call this a ""dark tour"" because it is far more than sensationalizing a horrible historical incident but it really emphasis the horrors of atomic weapons and it's real world effects.A must see while in Hiroshima."
"I have been putting Hiroshima and Nagasaki in my travel plan for quite sometime and finally got the chance though only Hiroshima this time. Reading a lot of history on the two cities in particular the A-bomb unfortunate event back in the horrific month of August 1945, over 70 years ago, I guess I am intrigued by what the two cities look like now. Once you step down from the shinkansen at the train station, you’ll find a city full of vibrations and lovely. What remains of the A-bomb blast is contained in the ground zero in the Memorial Park area. And stepping into the Museum is just like you were brought back to 1945 seeing the pictures, witnesses in videos and belongings of the victims of the bomb. A heartfelt goes to the people of Hiroshima as it says, for the victims,it will never end.God bless"
