Visited this place to go on a Dolphin watching tour. Beach is very small (& very dirty) and doesn't have many activities to do apart from Dolphin watching tour. I was fortunate enough to see several dolphins during my visit. Though the boats seem very risky. Would suggest them to have bigger boats for these tours.
Starting point for the Dolphin Tour. Good Nice clean beach but not recommended for swimming. Nice scenatic coconut trees at this beach. The way to this beach is so awesome. We paid approx INR 600 for the Dolphin Tour .
"Went here for the day but was disappointed,not much here and not very clean,a few stalls selling stuff and a few eating places,Winn stick to Candolim !!!!!!"
"Its a very small beach, but famous for boats which take you to supposedly dolphin watching. Dolphins are not clearly visible or distinguishable from the blue sea. Forget clicking picture of dolphins or with dolphins."
"Reached this beach via a boat trip to see dolphins, washroom facilities are very poor, and there is a small market in place, all adding to more rubbish on the beach. You certainly would not swim of the beach."
The Beach is just 5 kms from the clematis. Deserted and calm. Best place to see dolphins... The beach is not so clean but people are friendly enough to help.
"Lovely beach, but too much oil in the water and no wind. Sheltered too much. Good good on beach though."
Coco beach is pretty but crowded.  Went on a dolphin cruise and got a fleeting glimpse of a dolphin. There is no jetty - getting on requires you to walk into the sea.  Boat was okay but the operator asked two of us to sit on plastic stools - not a great experience. Also did not ask us to  put on life vests which were dumped on the floor and of poor quality.There are better cruises at other places.
I visit this place in november 2015. dolphin safari(Rs.300) is a new experience. you can actually spot dolphin during this ride. make sure you carry your glasses/goggles. or you can purchase it from local vendor(Rs.100).  Girl can flaunt with tiara(rs.30-40 bargain).
Good Indian food served in Indian style in a thali. The beach is not crowded. Did not bathe here. Plenty of colourful boats.
"Located about 30 minutes’ drive from the Panjim city center after crossing the Mandovi river & moving past by the river front near Nerul.  This is a common halt of local tour operators plying north Goa beaches. This picnic spot is a tiny beach front without any established public rest rooms but one can always buy some mineral water or soft drinks from the vendors & request to use their private toilet before going on to the boat ride to watch Dolphins & distant light house, British time jail (it is normally said that a petty crime is more than worth the deal to watch the sunset from the jail room), fort Aguada & rich diamond merchant’s iconic private bungalow from the boat.  There are many coconut trees & a short sandy stretch congested with outlets selling caps, clothing & sea shell trinkets.  It is better to carry some snacks with you if you plan to stay here a bit longer.  Also avoid wearing shoes because the boats stay put in water with periodic small waves & this can be an inconvenience during the boarding of it.  If too many tour operators come at the same time with busloads of tourists the entire place gets real crowded within no time."
Dirty beach. Went for dolphin trip. Saw 4 5 dolphins from distance. Nice view of aguada fort from dolphin trip.
"Enjoyed A most beautiful beach of Goa. Beautiful scenery,  not a beach you would go to spend the day sunbathing. The trip there is a lovely scenic journey, there are a couple of places to go to for food and drink. This wher you can hire a boat to go fishing. We enjoyed lot almost full day."
"Ofcourse its a beach but not for beach lovers situated near Nerul (4 kms from Candolim, 2 kms from Reis Margos Fort.)A single road entrance to beach and its narrow between flora.Make sure road is clear before enter else you may be asked for Reverse Gear option.Only thing you can do over here is Boating. Pay Rs.300/head( 250/- also depending on rush),boat guy will take a round where you find Dolphins, Agoda Jail, Agoda Light house,sides of Agoda fort and a private bunglaw of a diamond merchant. Its worth visit for children. Almost 45 min ride. Few clothes shacks and food shacks( bread omlette, juices ) are also present."
Beach is famous for scuba diving. A long 1 hour journey needed for experiencing scuba diving. Spent an entire day with other guys for a perfect scuba experience. Beers are provided while returning and also a decent meal was  provided in the package. Not so much special other than scuba and snockling
"Was in Goa with friends who had stayed at Coco beach many times and keen to show us where they spent many a good holiday, unfortunately the beach was almost destroyed by a Tsunami a couple of years ago. I can imagine how beautiful it must have been with palm lined beach and beach shacks but now a very busy fishing/ boat jetty taking fishermen out,you can take a boat trip from here but do your homework our trip was not the best geared more to locals rather than Europeans ( maybe use your tour company)"
"Not a good option to take small boats which have capacity of 10 odd people. Forget sighting of dolphins, the drivers take the boat bit far into sea n it starts swaying little strongly scaring hell out of those in the boat. No safety precautions followed by organizers. Pls take those big boats that can take 30-40 ppl which is stable and more enjoyable"
"Had a marvellous time sighting dolphins, saw a dozen of them. took a tour at about 10 am on a week day, though the trip lasted for 35 min (they promised a duration of 45 min to 1 hr)"
Went to Coco beach as part of a boat trip with a party of six way back in 2011 (only just got around to writing a review! lol) As part of the tour we went along the beautiful Goan coast taking in all India had to offer before arriving at Coco beach. Myself and others jumped overboard to cool off in the warm sea before enjoying a BBQ on the beach Goan style.
Went to this beach for lunch after a boat trip had a great lunch fish etc. The beach was ok not good for swimming due to sll the boats so lots of diesel in sea. Loved watching fishermen dragging their fishing nets in and the dogs scaring off the kites birds to stop them stealing the fish! amazing to watch them
"A lovely beach that’s quiet and tranquil, lovely shack food and the sea is like a mill pond. We have visited this beach a few times for time out from the normal hustle & bustle of some of the beaches in North Goa. Give it a go."
The beach is small and very dirty Pls be careful as there is broken glass and empty beer bottles around the beach and in the water. Wear appropriate footwear to protect yourself at all times even in the water.
We took a boat ride to see dolphins in the see from Coco Beach. We were lucky to spot few dolphins in the see. the beach is more like a private beach. Paid 300 per person for the boat ride. Except the chance to see the dolphins swim the see no other thing was interesting in the Boat ride
"Go here to take a boat trip, there are many boat trips available from here. The beach itself is awful. It must have been nice at one time, the palms sway and the sea is beautiful but we didn't stay long."
"This place was great. Rooms, comfort staff, pool. Did not regret booking it. We loved it. Wish I was still there."
"Coco beach at one time, used to be covered with shells and shells.Not anymore as I found during my recent visit.It was disappointing to see black sand and dirty waterproof .This is the commencing point for dolphin sightseeing and other boat rides. Reaching this beach is also difficult ,through narrow lanes .Other than that nothing much to do here ...it's better to visit the other nearby beaches."
"Unfortunately this beautiful beach suffered due to the after math effects of the Tsumani which happened a few years back (backlash of the Tsumani which hit Sri Lanka). It was such a beautiful beach much larger than it is now with approx 4/5 Beach shacks. The beach has been restored but lacks the feeling it had. It is still a smaller  pretty beach, safe waters for swimming, but not as well looked after. There are quite a few stalls on the way down to the beach. Also you will see the fishing boats land their catch of the day and moor up.There is 1 Restaurant on the entry to the beach area which has the monopoly. One needs a taxi or private car/scooter to get to this destination. The Entry from the Nerul side, just past Rita's Restaurant to the beach is One-Way. Please be careful/patient. Read the stretch of dirt track from the Nerul side to the Beach side. If clear you have the right of way. There is no room for 2 cars to pass so please don't even attempt it, as a tourist you will come off the worse. There are eating and drinking venues whilst on the beach but limited. If you come by taxi arrange for your taxi driver to return at a time suitable to yourself.There is plenty of Free Parking under the shade of the trees.The Beach is worth a visit. It is so peaceful"
"Had a morning dolphin watching just off the beach, followed by a very nice lunch on the beach. Very good excursion."
"Great beach, stayed over night and was so relaxed. Be mindful of the descent down to the beach it's quite a hike and not at all suitable for anyone with walking difficulties. Would recommend two nights or more and book independently, as the tours only give you a short time here"
Coco beach is lovely too sunbathe on.  Go out on the boat too see the dolphins swimming near the boat.
"I tried the dolphin and Aguada trip with my family. Ask you driver to take you the ticket counter. The boat ride is for 45 mins to 1 hour. There are four or five boats which travel together and shout to one another when there is a sighting. Dolphins popped up from the sea - but never close to the boat. After spending a whole lot of footage , I managed to catch the dark grey coloured dolphin back in my camcorder! The kids were excited. The boat ride also takes you near the Aguada Jail and the fort. Good photo op.I would suggest that you visit the Fort Aguada and then come to Coco Beach.My driver mentioned that dolphins come up to the surface in the afternoon and I tried the ride around noon."
"This beach is nothing like the photos you will see.  It is not as clean as other beaches nearby, and nothing special. Found it to be littered and not as clean as other beaches around it."
"A private beach with tents to sleep in (with running water, toilet and shower!) Your our bar & barman with a super show put on at night by the local village ladies. Just sit and relax in your own little world. If you are staying in the north of Goa take a taxi (£30) as the bus is back breaking!, but its worth the trip. Enjoy"
"Amazing boat ride, very frightening but also enjoyable. It was an experience. The person who was piloting the boat was very encouraging and assured that all will be well. Thank you"
Heard a lot about the famous coco beach !!!! To say it was a disappointment is an understatement the place wasn’t clean even by Indian standards we will not make an haste return
