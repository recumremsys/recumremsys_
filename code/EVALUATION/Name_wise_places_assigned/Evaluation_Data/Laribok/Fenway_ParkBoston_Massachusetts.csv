"Whether you are a Red Sox fan or not, Fenway Park has same the feeling of historical gravity that many monuments or battlefields convey.  This could be considered the heart of Boston, since it is the oldest continuously used gathering spot for Bostonians of all sorts for over 108 years. Though the park has been updated and renovated a few times since it first opened, one still gets a sense of how it looked on the first day.  the tour will take you to the most public places as well as the lesser known behind the scenes areas, and give you more information than you could imagine about all the personalities and  events to which this park has played host.  On Game Day, the neighborhood around the park is full of human drama and human interest as people pour into the stadium from all sides for pre-game meals and drinks and celebrations.  A must see location when visiting Boston. Go Red Sox!"
"Brimming with history, Fenway is a must see ballpark. We got to see the park from every angle including the green monster, press box, and even inside the locker room. Just seeing the classic framed photos along the walls was worth the visit. The tour group leader, a retired fellow from Boston was awesome and authentic as the ballpark itself. Great info and enthusiasm!"
"In all honesty baseball in boston is awesome. Fenway is one of the oldest stadium's with so much history however they have some great modern upgrades and options. As a yankee fan its hard to admit but fenway is definitely one of my favorite spots to catch a game at!! Came here during marathon week and caught a sunday day game. We sat in the sam adams section and had a great time. Beers were cold, sun was out, and the food was hot. Catching a game at fenway or even just taking a tour is a must when visiting the Boston area!!"
"Nothing beats the sounds, smell and atmosphere of Fenway Park.  A classic park you have to visit.  Whether you live in Boston or are visiting you have to try to get to a game.  Standing room only seats are affordable and my favorite place to watch the game is standing in back behind home plate (even with seats I still like to stand here!) You get to take it all in and is a great view"
"I'm a Sox fan. White Sox fan, but loved the historic atmosphere at Fenway. Get there early to enjoy the festivities and party around the stadium because being a dated place, there's not a lot to do inside but watch the game, and the way Boston played this year it wasn't very exciting. Still great to visit and recommended as part of any trip to Boston."
Fenway Park is one of the oldest baseball parks in the USA. The green monster was fantastic. Being there in person really make you appreciate the size and hright of the wall.
"Coming from St. Louis we are baseball people, seeing the well preserved history of baseball’s oldest park was really awesome. I wasn’t expecting to get up on the green monster or to get a view from the press room but that was all part of the basic tour. Would love to come back for a game during the season."
"Growing up in New England, Fenway Park will always be close to my heart. This old park is full of history and nostalgia. Granted, the seating is old, the paint is chipping and seating is limited compared to big stadiums but honestly there is not a bad seat in the house and it is an experience well worth the price! Whenever I have friends visiting I always try to bring them to a game and share the experience. They also have opportunities for personal tours and to walk the field!"
"Biased opinion because I'm a huge Sox fan, but this place holds so much history from the city and the sport. It is 80% history, 20% Red Sox, so anyone can enjoy!"
"What more can I say?  The venerable Boston Fenway Park.  Built 107 years ago. Home of Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and, of course, Big Papi.  Definitely a must see when in 'Beantown'"
"I'm a huge baseball fan and taking a tour of the oldest active MLB stadium in the league was a must for me. Went behind the scenes in the press box, in one of the locker rooms and went on top of the Green Monster! Very friendly tour guides too!"
"Now the oldest major league ballpark still in use it is steeped in the history of the game. We went to couple of games in August and were thrilled to sit next to the Ted Williams red seat. If you can't get to a game then guided tour is a must for any baseball fan. Buying tickets is straight forward using the Ballpark app or book on line and the Red Sox will post your tickets. You can't print your tickets at home as you can with most other teams through Ticketmaster. If you're staying near Copley Square then Fenway is an easy walk. There are much better, more modern ballparks but none with Fenway's history."
"Taking a tour of Fenway Park is a fabulous thing to do on a trip to Boston.  You definitely don’t need to be a baseball fan to appreciate this and have a good time! The guides are brilliant. Telling the story through the years as you go through the tour brings the place to life!  A great way to spend an hour. It’s very fast moving and no time to get bored! We walked there from Waterfront area (intercontinental hotel), was do-able but would recommend you call an Uber.  Taxi’s are not easy to find around the stadium, certainly in off season when we visited, so the Uber app is a must for a ride back into town. Tours are around $20 each and well worth it."
This place is historic! Fenway with the green monster is one of the most famous buildings in the country! Enjoy a fenway frank! See the gorgeous field.  Have a sausage before you go in from the sausage guy! His are awesome. Go early and walk around the entire park inside and out to get the whole experience. Be ready people were smaller in 1911 so the seats are a bit crowded. But you can find many a place to stand and watch the game and drink a beverage! Go Sox!
"If you find yourself in Boston, and regardless of how much of a baseball fan you are, if you are looking to see and experience a great slice of americana history, then a tour, or a game at Fenway park is for you. Try to get on top of the green monster or get inside the wall during a tour."
Went to a game in august and it was great fun.  Fenway park still has its old charm and it is a bit like going back in time.  Everybody (age 9-43) had a great time.  The people obviously go there for the atmosphere as well as the game.  Great bonus that the Red Sox won since my son is a huge fan :)
Live long Pirates fan but couldn’t miss the opportunity to see the iconic Fenway Park while on our Boston trip. Was after the season and all the turf was ripped up but still 100% glad I took the tour and would highly recommend
"Fenway is a great time when the Sox are playing but equally as fun to tour the park when they are not at home. The park along with  Chicago’s Wrigley are just special parts of baseball history with their old time architecture and unique blend of old and new. As a fan of Boston, it was great to step on the field , go inside the famed a Green Monster, and walk on the wall! The park is just a beautiful example of a historic cultural icon located in Boston’s beautiful Fenway area. Learning about the story of Fenway and where icons like Ted Williams, Jim Rice, and Future Hall of Famer Mookie Betts play was a great experience!"
"We're not even baseball fans but on our last day in Boston, we felt compelled to go by Fenway Park. We joined a tour and were thoroughly entertained. So much history and so much depth to the oldest ballpark in the country. How special it is that the owners continued on the tradition of keeping the stadium and bringing it up to date. I only wish the grass on the field was planted but they were updating a new watering system. Be sure to join a tour and take in the atmosphere and history."
Watched the Red Sox and Cubs play at Fenway about 3 years ago. Just wow! So much history. Seats were tight but manageable.  Did not know they had a tour so we will be back.
Anyone going to Boston must go to a game at Fenway Park. My daughter and I had a great time. Go to the restaurant there too the food is great. Fun time for all. I had a really good meal before the game!
Been here many times as a kid and young adult growing up. Fenway Park has seen more memories than you could possibly imagine. If you are a baseball fan and you havent been to Fenway than your not a true baseball fan plain and simple.
Visited today on a tour. We are not baseball fans we are in Boston for the Bruins and Celtics. This place is a must. Talk about history. Our guide Mario was funny and knowledgeable. So much information about the place and great stories. Sat in all parts of the ground and even in the Green Monster section. New stadiums are great but this place was beautiful in the sense that so much has remained the same. Visit it and enjoy even if you're not a baseball fan.
Attending a warmup and a game at Fenway is one of the best sports experiences to be had. Perfect for a family event especially in the spring or early part of the season.
"FENWAY Park is a great place to visit for a day, take in a Red Sox game which is always fun in the summertime, nice warm weather, it’s the oldest ballgame in America! Take in a tour of the ballpark great way to learn some history of it. My friends and I have done both and highly recommend it, worth wild!"
"Growing up locally, I’ve always loved the Red Sox. This was an amazing tour being able to go behind the scenes. Sitting in the press box was the best part."
First time seeing Fenway park and it was truly amazing to see. Say big thank you to John the tour guide he was very knowledgeable of his information about Fenway park and history that had happen there. I would definitely do it again
"What a great ballpark! The tour was worth every dollar! A very enjoyable and informative experience. Whether you are a Red Sox fan or not Fenway park is worth the experience.We were in the visitors locker room, sat in the press box and even sat at the top of the Green Monster.  Our tour guide was excellent!  Check it out!"
"Nothing live a live Red Sox Game, with the place filled and the players on the filed. While they do offer tours and you can do one in the off months the Best way to see the park is at a game. Even the cheap seats allow you to walk around the whole park.  See the Green Monster with players on the field."
"My husband is a baseball nut and Fenway Park was on his bucket list - so we took the tour when we were in town for a cruise.  I was being a good wife by going, but let me tell you the tour was amazing!  A lot of history in that park.  And they have a vegetable garden for the food!  Don't miss the red seat dedicated for Ted Williams.  Actually don't miss this tour if you have time.  We went to the game that night and it was very cool, the acoustics in the stadium were a wonderful surprise."
"Great tour, informative, many photo opportunities, great history! Worth doing whether a fan or not! Be Sure to check out the bar by the field and huge merch store."
"One of the best parks in the US. Must go to. Must get a beer. Must get a fenway frank! Yawkey way is so fun to explore beforehand. Once you get in fenway, take it all in! Walking out for the first time was an amazing feeling!"
"Being Aussies in Boston our dream was to see Fenway Pk. We organised a tour online (easy) and turned up early to visit the merchandise shop. What a wonderful experience the tour was. Being taken  on the tour by knowledgeable,passionate and enthusiastic guides and carefully having the history explained was a highlight of our holiday. Thank you!"
"Great experience. Seeing the green monster, seeing and hearing about all of the baseball greats.  Fantastic c! 👏😃"
"Mr. Bob was by far the best tour guide I have ever had in this iconic masterpiece.  Learned so much about my beloved fenway park.  Will be back to do again and again.  Boston icon is definitely worth the hour, I could have spent several just soaking in the history inside the park."
