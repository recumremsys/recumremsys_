"This place is just like a Heaven you wonâ€™t believe what I felt after visiting this place, This place is very close to Fort aguada I visited this place multiple time and I never regret. Attach pictures will give you exact explanation what I felt. This is just outstanding define lot of Greenery Rock and see all together."
Location is really breathtaking. Getting there was bit strenuous .. But once there it was really nice experience.  Too much food waste and garbage around. But still it a place worth visiting.
"This fort in Goa has so much to see. Starting from the lighthouse to the prison cells to the exquisite view of the Arabian sea, its simply beautiful. Although, what remains now are just unpainted remains of the rocks, it is an important place of visit to those who have keen interest for historical places."
"This place is just too beautiful. The fort is very ancient and it's structure is very massive. There is beach surrounding the fort and that's what looks amazing. Surrounded by greenary and beach, it is just not possible to miss this place."
"This is tourist place that is a must visit. Mainly because of the architecture and the surrounding that this fort was purpose built for. To provide fresh water to ships that docked hence the name ""aguada"" which means watering place in Portuguese.Visitors can park their vehicle in the designated parking area and take a nice walk to the fort. One can visit the lower levels and take the stairs to come near the lighthouse. Walk around the ramparts and get a sense of how this fort would have worked both as a lighthouse, a watering place and a storage for ammunition. Get scenic view of the Arabian Sea while overlooking the Sinquerim beach. There is nothing much to look at in this fort compound however the well-preserved fort is a welcome change to the numerous ruins of Portuguese forts that one get to witnesses. You can spend an hour easily in this fortified area and have a small picnic in the garden under the shade of the trees. And later visit the"
I had visited in the afternoon. Had clear sky and the scenery was beautiful. It was a good place to visit with wife. Took lots of pics and enjoyed ourselves.
"Great Architectural Wonder, with History Embedded. Need time if you want to explore and hear stories from guide !! Ample Parking Space, Approach Road till fort is good..!! Last 50-100 meter which one need to walk can be improved. Must Visit.. Better than Chapora Fort.!!"
"First off, this attraction is free to visit.  Do read the history on it as it makes it that much more interesting.  There's a moat, a lighthouse, springs that were used to supply water to the ships, thus the name, as well as great views of the Indian ocean/Arabian sea.  The current accessible area is fairly small, yet well intact, but the original fort area is very large."
This place has a lot of beautiful views. You will be clicking great pictures here. There is no entry fee but you need to pay for parking if you have bike or car. Spending an hour at this place will be worth . The history of this place is quite interesting.
"Visited this place with friends and was nice for once a visit kind of places. There is no formal group of organiser managing any activity or a guide to narrate the things, hence lacks the excitement. The place is clean and views are nice, but there are better places to explore in Goa if u have visited it once. Yes for families, can ignore for friends... still, if u wish to go, then read about it to avoid disappointment of being there and feel the history with knowledge."
My husband and Are Seniors late 70â€™s and 80â€™s and the walked stairs were worth it to venture up to the top. Great history when you start your tourist adventure up to the Light house. The gorgeous views of The a Mandovi River are a plus. No cost to explore. Wear sensible low healed walking shoes. Rough areas construction going on.
This place is well maintained and well preserved. Walking along the fort walls is a thrilling experience and the views of the Arabian sea offers good photo opportunities. Combine this trip with water sports in aguda beach and it's a good way to spend half a day
"If you are looking at a great view of the sea, this fort should definitely be on your list. Surrounded by sea on all the sides, this rustic architectural beauty has a great appeal. This massive fort was built in 1612 and has been one of the most important Portuguese construction."
"Very interesting place. Fort is old but mostly in good condition. Views are really awesome and spectacular, we made very excellent pictures, especially I liked sunset here. There is not so crowded in evening hours. Recommend for visiting."
Beautiful view of the blue water is mesmerizing along with cool breeze of the river but it is difficult to spend hours if its bright sunny day. Parking facility is available which is very expensive.
"Entry fee: FreeTypical time to spend here is 2 hours for me was 10 minutes. ðŸ˜‚ Unfortunately for me this place was overhyped and overcrowded. The place is really nice to visit, on arrival we could not even get up the stairs to see the fort from a height as there was a family of 35 on every step they were all getting that â€˜picturesqueâ€™ family photo. ðŸ’¤ Going totally off topic I never see the need for a selfie to let everyone know â€˜Iâ€™ve been here, hereâ€™s proofâ€™ you donâ€™t need a selfie for everything. The world is gone mad. Every part of this fort was really overpacked. So I couldnâ€™t really enjoy the experience.I thought it was really cool to know there is a prison house in the fort where accused of the crimes such as abuse, drugs abuse and trafficking are lodged in. It is closed for public visits. And this jail is one of the largest jails in Goa! If your the historical type and feel you canâ€™t miss out. Go for it. I was just passing time with the driver but would not go out of my way during my day to see this."
"The main interest of place is its historic value. Having said that, people interested in scenic beauty will also find it interesting. The place is very well maintained and they are restoring some outer walls while keeping the old shade in."
"Historical place, with some interesting stories. Earlier used as jail and as light house. You can visit this place on Bike or Car (parking available). Prefer visit in morning or evening (particularly when it's sunny day). Plan for at least an hour; this visit involves some walk (not an issue for young folks) so plan accordingly. Near parking you'll find some stalls of tea/ snacks etc. Washroom (near main gate) is also available but it closes around 4 - 5 PM (no strict timings mentioned though). Visit with family and friends, click snaps and spend some time walking inside the fort."
"This is a popular spot in North Goa and as its listed as a tourist spot it attracys busloads of tourists. There is nothing much left of the old fort save the sunset view and the glory is with a hotel which has taken its name!The Aguada fort is a monument to Portuguese construction and engineering. Although parts of it have fallen to the ravages of time, much of it is intact and it remains the best preserved Portuguese fort in India today. Built over three years from 1609 to 1612, it once defended the Portuguese stronghold against Dutch and Maratha invaders.It is named for the fresh water spring that gives the fort a constant supply of potable water, â€˜aguaâ€™ being the Portuguese word for water and â€˜Aguadaâ€™ signifying a place where water is collected. So well built and fiercely armed was this fort that it has never fallen into enemy hands."
"Is a lovely walk to the fort from candolim, about 1 hour. We went around 9am & lots of shade from the trees. Some uphill walking near the end but we enjoyed the walk. Great for bird watching. We refused to go in when we got there once we saw the ridiculous unfair price, 25rs for Indians & 300 rs for foreigners!!   How unfair is that! It's the principal rather than the cost! We turned back & went to the jail which again was a nice walk & gave a good view of the jail & millionaires palace."
"Taj Group has few properties in Goa. Attached to Beach & Red Fort this is exciting and fascinating property. Airy lobby, connected to all directions - restaurant, pool, beach gives you real feeling of Goa. Resort ambience makes it a perfect destination with facilities and beach. Room overlooking beach are interesting with basic facilities. Bathrooms are small and not Hotel type lavish. We got room at 4 pm since booking was done the same day but staff was apologetic. Food is tasty and has all the typical characteristics of Taj. Connectivity to beach makes it sought after venue."
One of the most visited places in north goa. blend of nature and ancient architecture. Gives and awesome view.
The place has a nice history and is well kept alive still. Its a scenic place by the sea with lush greenery all over the fort. Great spot for clicking pics and i see many couples owe to each other in the back drop of the fort/beach. Pre wedding shoots and aspiring models definitely come over to click in this place.
"Staying at Taj Fort Aguada, we had the opportunity to visit the fort conveniently and spend some cosy moments while seeing the sunset. Unfortunately we also saw whole lot of trash in the sea. Disappoint. Wonder why people are so careless."
Interesting walk through the fort. Great lookout point and interesting architecture. Go in the morning to avoid the crowds and the heat
"Drove to this historic fort. Nice views overlooking sea. Worth a visit but wear sensible shoes. Health and safety isnâ€™t at its best, so keep an eye on young children."
"It is a picturesque fort, or what's remaining of it. Gets right into the sea and offers beautiful views of the waves crashing on to it. One can cover it well in under 2 hours, so could be clubbed with another place on the same day even if you are on a lazy holiday."
"At least there is a bit of history here & the views down the beach are superb, all the way to Baga.But it's such a undeveloped place- at least the Government should clean it up considering that so many tourists visit this area. And the litter! Why does the Taj hotel not help? They have taken the most impressive part of it. Surely  they should put something back into the community?Watch out, the area is infested with snakes. Ask any local."
Itâ€™s a very beautiful and must see place. You can spend a good 2-3 hours there. Read the history behind it and explore the fort. Amazing views from the fort towards the surrounding sea. Great for taking pictures. We went with young children. Also they had enjoyed a lot. Carry bottle of water if going in summer. It can get hot there.
One of the well maintained forts in goa.. Crowded but very much worth a visit. Awesome views. Make sure to visit early or late evening as it can get hot in the noon.. Open till 5.
It is has got great view of goa and can spend a good amount of 3 hours here. Try to visit in the morning before it get crowded and entry gates will be closed by 4 pm.
"Quite famous tourist attraction of goa .a perfect view of sea and feels the coolest breeze. Sit on the edge of fort walls n rejuvenate yourself,well maintained and easily accessible"
"A very interesting place. You can reach the fort tower either by walking up a slope or climbing the stairs, walking the narrow passage battlefronts (walkways), climbing down another slope. One stretch was very narrow- not more than 2 feet, at a height of atleast about 8-10 feet from ground; it is a little scary that there was no safety rails and with people trying to walk this stretch on either directions. But it was a very good experience.It has road on 3 sides and  water on one side. The lower part of the fort is a jail, and there is no entry. Better to visit the place early morning or later in the evening, as there is very little shade inside the Fort. Walking on the battlefronts/ walkways on the 3 sides is an experience and one should try it, even though it was a little scary.I missed the Sinquerim Fort, but i think it would be a good idea to visit that fort along with this one as well."
Drove about 10kms from the Baga beach on bikes and spend about 1hr at the Fort. It was fun... took lot of pictures all around. Apart that not much to do... so visit only if you have some free time at hand.
A well known tourist place. Fort Aguada built with red stone which lasts against sea water. Built by Portuguese for protection against Dutch and others. A fresh water spring in the fort provided fresh water to ship sailing to the port. A very thick red stone wall with deep ditch which was fiiled up full with water to protect against enemies. Space for cannon & gun shooting kept. A scenic view of Arabian Sea and Panji city.
