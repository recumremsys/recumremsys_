"Been in Istanbul so many times and this was the first time I visited Dolmabahce Palace. I like the tour altough somehow I expected more. Many corridors parts of Palace were under restauration and closed for visitors.I general Museum has a lot to offer, nice history and way of live in last century.Main remark- Toilets are not well maintained!"
"We've been to several palaces over the years, and this might have been our favourite besides Hampton Court Palace outside of London. The Grand Ceremony Hall literally took my breath away. I have never seen a more impressive room anywhere. There are some beautiful marks of craftsmanship throughout the palace with lovely floors, furniture, and even a 4.5 tonne crystal chandelier. You have to see the Crystal Staircase in person to appreciate how beautiful it is. Make time to see this if you go to Istanbul. One word of warning though, go at opening as the queue gets very, very long quickly."
"Beautiful Dolmabahçe is closed on Mondays and Thursday’s. We went on a Sunday and it was the only day available to us and the queues were very long. I would suggest going early in the morning if that day is your only choice. They only have three kiosk to buy tickets from. The tickets are to the Dolmabahçe palace and you would have to pay extra to visit the Harem which is where Attaturk died. There is also a clock Museum which has clocks made by Ottoman Mawlawi clock masters English and French crafted clocks. The Glazed Pavilion was being restored so we really couldn’t see. There is also an Aviary. The palace itself is very big and it gives you an insight to how the Sultan lived. The beautiful furniture, Art work, porcelain, crystal and gold and silver dinnerware sets are stunning. Beware they don’t like pictures taken inside. I only sneaked a couple a bought a book at the exit but that really doesn’t give it any justice. There are cafeteria on sight not to expensive."
"Try to reach early as  there can be a really long que for the entrance. It's was more beautiful than I expected it to be ,great history and architecture. One must take a guide or an Audio guide(available at the entrance, Id is a must if you want audio guide )to have a better understanding and experience"
This was one of my favorite sights. I got there to line up before it opened and I used an audio guide to learn all about the palace. I recommend getting the extra pass to see the Harem as the tour groups don’t go in there and I was alone as I wandered through. Pictures are not allowed inside and is strictly enforced. It took me about 1.5 hours to cover both buildings and by the time I was leaving it was packed with school children and tourists. Make sure to check out the aviary. Do not go to the cafe outside the gates it has the worst customer service.
This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. The palace is enormous and the outdoor/gardens were beautiful. Photos do not do justice to this palace. Viewing it from a ferry on the Bosphorus provides another view of just how large this place is. The only downside was the restriction on taking photos inside. The rooms were gorgeous.
"Don't be fooled by some of the photos, there are no longer guards standing outside or inside by the huge entrance doors. lots of parts are under renovations, yet ticket prices are not lowered. But it's a must see place because of its history."
"Come here to see a magnificent display of wealth and grandeur.  Plan to do a lot of walking,  it is huge.  I went to the haram first, then the clock museum,  aviary and last the palace itself. The grounds are beautiful and right on the water,  but living there meant you were behind gates all around.  Plan about 1-2 hours to visit,  and 45 min to wait in line for a ticket."
"Don't miss the site. it helps you to feel a touch of Haram life in Ottoman's time.there is also a room,, where AtaTurk spent his last hours. somehow touching and thrilling."
"Really a good visit.  Avoid the lines, come early.  But we really were amazed by the amount of history it covers"
"It was raining day and I decide to visit Dolmabanche Palace.. I was really surprised how wonderful this Palace is. .Splendid rooms, but lSultan's library (oh my God what beauty), music room with so amazing instruments to bathroom all in marble. .Even stairs aer out of world with Chrystal glass columns. Amazing place. From Palace and  fantastic garden you have a  view at Bosporus. Such a  wonderful position by the sea. It is  necessary to see a Topkapi Palace, older palace and than a  new one- Dolmabanche Palace. Take time for a visit. With garden you need a few hours."
"How the royals lived!!! The place is very well maintained including the carpets , thanks to making visitors wear plastic over their footwear. Taking of pictures was prohibited and many managed to still click them. The Gardens with ponds and turkeys are lovely and i wish we could spend more time outdoors . We were lucky to catch a turkish millitary band performance in front of the palace. The band looked every bit part of the palace with it's fine music , grand costumes and lovely singing."
"Def worth your time. This palace replaced the topkapi palace and is  huge and extravagant throughout, set right on the waters edge. Takes about 1.5 to 2 hours to see fully. Lovely gardens too."
If you are planning to visit Istambul you must see this palace!!! You have to reserve 3-4 hours to visit it and it is worth!!!! Check out the calendar before you travel so you can plan and don’t miss it because it is close on Mondays!
"Probably the highlight of my trip, I simply cannot forget the grand hall and the chandelier that adorned the middle of the hall. Most of the bedrooms overlooked the Bosphorus as well as the palace itself. Gorgeous gardens, regal rooms full of period drapery, furniture and floor coverings. Paintings adorning the walls and a good selection of the Sultans personal items on display. Remember to pick up an audio guide in your respective language. Very enjoyable experience highly recommended. Your trip to Istanbul isn't complete if you haven't visited the Dolmabaçe Palace"
Went to Istanbul for a break....be warned most attractions are under MAJOR renovations for next 2 to 3 years.  Therefore found things like blue mosque etc very disappointing...however this palace was a little gem.  Amazing bling.  There is some renovation but not too much.  Well worth a visit. As normal take cash as places in Istanbul don’t take cards.  Also for free audio guide you must hand over driving license or passport as deposit...
"I do not see Dolmabahce Palace as home to some of our sultans. I only think of it as the place where Mustafa Kemal, the Father of our Nation, died. May he rest in peace forever! Looking at his room and the bed with the flag was an experience I will never forget."
"Does not fell right, European (close to Italian architecture) in the middle of Turkey.... really? Yes, the palace is quite nice, but it, IMHO, is a total dissonance with the Istanbul spirit.  Worth visiting anyway, Guided tours were not helpful, especially off season."
"Unfortunately, I didn’t have a chance to get inside the palace, anyway, seeing the palace fine arch details from outside and quality that stays until now gives insights on Turkey’s empire bright days. Deserve to see and to passing by."
placed beside the sea looking great even from out side. the garden and the building it selves looks good and the architecture is very nice the paintings inside and the whole things was really good specially the library full of old books looks Georges. very easy to be reached by tram.
I am still dreaming about this palace! Do not hesitate to visit it! It is easily to access and you will find out the sultans’ way of living.
It was by far the most beautiful palace I have ever seen. The hour wait outside was so worth it. Go early! Enjoy!
"Try to go as early as you can to the palace to avoid the long ques as it's one of the main attractions of Istanbul . It's a must see, as it takes you to how the Ottoman emperor was living around the 19th century. Strictly no photos or videos inside."
"This place is HUGE.  Easily one of the biggest palaces in the world.  The rooms, and  furnishings are very impressive. Photos are not allowed inside the palace.  Our local agent in Istanbul (Efendi Travel) had organised guided tours of the city for us, but inside the palace our small group (we were only three couples, a total of six people) was merged into a larger group, and led around by a palace guide.  Some kind of guidance is an absolute must, if you wander around on your own, you would waste a lot of time and still not see all the important areas, rooms, etc... This palace is relatively new, it was built in the mid 1800's.  Several historical events relating to recent Turkish history took place here, (Ataturk died here), the guides will explain everything.  I repeat: it is huge, it is much better to be guided through this complex than to strike out on your own with an audio guide.  You can seek clarifications from a human guide, not from a recorded audio guide!  A word of caution: little kids, or for that matter, even teenagers, may be bored with seeing room after room.  Also, if you do not have a passion for history you may find the whole thing quite uninteresting.  The location of the palace on the Bosporus is fantastic.  The views from outside the palace, of the Bosporus, are  stunning.  Some people may even find the outside more interesting than the inside!  You can get great photos from outside.  Incidentally, there is a huge cafe just outside the palace, the location could not be better, on the banks of the Bosporus.  Food is good.  Just outside the palace is the Dolmabahce Mosque.  A small, but really beautiful mosque.  Well worth seeing.  Don't miss it!  Photos allowed inside this mosque."
The place is truely beautiful. Gets very busy with tourist in the season. I recommend to visit both Palace and Harem if you have the time. A lot less people visit the Harem. You Will see Ataturk dead bed in the Harem. The combi ticket for both places is 90 £.
Don’t even think of kissing this. Get their early to avoid long queues. No need to spend extra for Harem. Pictures not allowed and even stopped harshly by the staff. Why the pics not allowed if it’s a public space? Sorry dudes. I can’t rely on my memory only to recall this wonderful place
"Dolmabahçe Palace was a wonderful surprise. I didn’t expect to see such grandeur. It is beautifully situated on the banks of the Bosporus and is very well preserved. The main greeting rooms are very ornate and are amazing. There’s also a crystal staircase and stunning, crystal chandeliers. Visiting this palace was the highlight of my trip to Istanbul. A definite must see. It was also very easy to get to by tram."
Loved our visit to this beautiful palace in Istanbul!Be sure to pick up audio guide to take in all the details.  Great location on the Bosporus Strait
"It’s a must see if you r visiting isthanbul. Very beautiful palace . Remember to take cash for buying tickets, as card payment is not available. Monday the palace is closed for tourists."
"It's further out from the centre of Istanbul then the other attractions, but worth a visit. Take the tram all the way to the Kabatas station, then walk 10 minutes to the palace. We opted for the Palace and Harem, costing 90 lira. No need to pay extra for the audio guide, but you have to leave your ID or 200 lira.I preferred the Topkapi palace, but it's different, so go see both.The Crystal museum was closed, but the clock museum is included in the price.No photos inside."
"Very interesting place.  Much better with a guided tour to get the whole picture.  Lots of interesting things to see and learn about a piece of Turkey's history.  For some reason, staff are obsessed with people not taking pictures inside.  They should allow pictures without flash (most cameras today can handle low light conditions). Anyway, an absolutely beautiful and interesting place to see and visit.  Make some time to sit in one of its cafes just facing the strait and enjoy a snack and tea or coffee.  It will round up the experience to a perfect day or afternoon."
Do yourself a favour and go to this palace - it is worth it! The gardens are beautiful and not to mention the building architecture! Absolutely loved walking through the palace - the decor and paintings are simply stunning! Just so sad that you pay all that money and cannot take photos. Surely this can be changed? Not sure on the reasons for no photos.
Such a beautiful historic palace. Has a super cozy and nice cafe near the art gallery. Highly recommended.
"The palace is not associated with the Ministry of Culture so the Museum Card is useless here.  90TL to visit everything (the apartment + haram + something I can’t remember and didn’t go due to time strain).  You can’t take photos inside, which I found ridiculous.  If the old palace would allow you to take photos inside, why the new palace wouldn’t?  I can't think of a good reason other than trying to sell visitors the guide book?  Audio guide is quite poor too, it didn’t give much more information than what’s on the display boards.  If they allow us to take the photos, then the ticket price is tolerable.  Saying this, this palace's decoration is way over the top.  You can imagine why Ottoman Empire's finance got into trouble after they built this palace."
Simply beautiful. Covid-19 precautions in place. Fantastic audio guide was free and had trigger points that identified where you were and told you about that specific area. Lots of security and staff should you need them and the building and views are incredible. We had a lovely time. Thank you
