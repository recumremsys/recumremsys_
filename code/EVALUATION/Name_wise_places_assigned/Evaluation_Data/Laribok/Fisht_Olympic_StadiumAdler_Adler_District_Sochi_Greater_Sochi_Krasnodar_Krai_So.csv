"Watched Portugel - Spain here. I was a great experience, great organization and incredible well located"
Had a great time watching the Olympics opening. Great technology - amazing projections of videos and pictures. Very well organized to find your place and to get out again.
"An amazing modern venue, great viewing of the field, easy to get a drink, exudes atmosphere. Was functional to enter arena and the service was very good when dealing with ticket issues. Worth a visit"
"Visited during the World Cup 2018. Very modern stadium, easy to find your way around. Great atmosphere when full (and seeing the right game !)"
"Very nice stadium. Saw Spain vs Portugal there and boy, did we get our money's worth! As it is smaller, you can see the match properly. And of course, Ronaldo made every second worth it!"
Watched World Cup football match and stadium was great for this purpose. Approximately a 15 minute walk from the station.
Went to the World Cup game between Australia and Peru at this stadium. It is very large and new. The precinct has lots of other sporting venues.
Had a fantastic weekend in Sochi watching the world cup soccer game of Germany vs Sweden. The stadium is first class within great hotels nearby
"Stadium is incomplete. Outstanding works were well hidden during the Sochi 2014 Games but will need to be finished to a much higher standard before the 2018 Football World Cup. Open manholes, raw sewage, emergency exits into dead-ends, dangerous steps, incorrect signage, the list is endless. The design is superb, the execution is diabolical."
Watched the 1/8 (Portugal vs Uruguay) and 1/4 finals (Russia vs Croatia). Great facility and location
It was built for the Winter Olympic Games 2014 in Sochi. It's located in the Olympic Park in Adler.I was there with my family for Uruguay vs Portugal World Cup match. Great infrastructure. Very well organised. Great experience. Hoping to catch some more games there some time!
