"What a great place! We did the night tour, which is self-guided with an audio device. It's a lot of walking, but it is very interesting and very informative. Save yourself some headache and park in the lot next door (which is $12 after 5 p.m. Sunday through Thursday.)"
Haven’t visited any prisons before so this was a cool experience. The tour is all self guided with an audio tour so you can go at your own pace and see what you pick. Went on a warm winter day but it was freezing inside. Never need to go more than once. But for a one time thing it was pretty cool.
Great trip. The audio set provided a lot  information and the tour gave great glimpses of life there. Provided hands on activities on how and why prison rates are on the rise.  Didn’t take too long to tour maybe 2 hours.
"Haunting and interesting! Took my teenage son who loved it...the audio tour is excellent, but it is a semi-expensive entrance fee. The audio tour is included. There is free parking if you can get it along the road in front of it or an expensive lot next door. Definitely worth the visit!  Similar to an Alcatraz visit:)"
The audible tour was really interesting. Reminds me of the time I visited Alcatraz. The guides were friendly and the staff pleasant. Good way to spend a few hours. There was a bit of felt coercion and racial tones as to whether our criminal justice system works for everyone. Not sure a tourist spot is the right place for this or not. Nice spot overall
"Took the day tour through the facility.  The audio was included with the price of admission.  It was very easy to use.  You only needed to key in the number to match what you were seeing.  The stories on the audio really gave you the flavor of the prison and it was so interesting.  Spent several hours there walking through the chilling prison at our own pace.  We enjoyed it so much that we went back that night for ""Terror Behind the Walls"", which is only available during the Halloween season.  It was a terrifying experience, but very well worth it if you enjoy ghouls popping out at you and grabbing you.  It was, hands down, the scariest Halloween haunted house I've ever been to."
Toured this facility and ended up spending almost 3 hours just looking around.  The tour is an audio tour but unlike a lot of self directed tours was both very informative and interesting.  If you are in Philly definitely looking at!
"The tour guide was not as knowledgeable as we would have liked, but this place is something to experience. it is the nations first Penitentiary, and the groundbreaking philosophy that led to its construction is worth thinking about. Especially with the prison issues we have today. Seeing Capone's cell was also memorable."
"We were curious to see how things were. The self guided audio visual tour was excellent allowing you to pick and choose  bits of information, depending on your interests. Do not expect well preserved cells throughout all the blocks- this is not the case. But you get a great understanding of the origin of the design, the intent of incarceration originally, and the impact this penitentiary had on the evolution of jails."
"This place was very interesting.  Loved the self-guided tour so much that we didn't feel the need to go to the guided tour.  Keep in mind that the place isn't climate-controlled, so avoid the really cold or really hot weather.  It's also not really handicapped-accessible at this point, although I think they're working toward that."
We were blown away by this place. It’s a definite must see! The history (which I’m not a huge history person) was jaw dropping. Check out Groupon before u visit
"This was an excellent historic building, and the audio tour (narrated by Steve Buscemi!) added a great deal to the already interesting displays. Quite a bit of the complex is either outdoors or poorly heated, so bring a jacket if you're visiting in winter. Also, not particularly accessible for guests with mobility issues."
Very interesting. Enjoyed the audio tour. Lots to see and explore. Employees were helpful and polite. Place is very creepy. Would recommend.
"Out of all the sights visited, this is my favorite!  I was there for hours exploring and taking pictures.  Trudging around in 110 degrees was exhausting, but so worth the effort.  There are a couple of places with AC to relax and cool off inside the penitentiary.  The cells are decaying and artifacts are left in them.  The lighting is spectacular for creepy photography."
"Finally got to visit the Penitentiary, and it is definitely worth the trip. Signage and the audio part of the tour explain details about the prison you may not readily notice. Be advised that the prison is not air conditioned but there is a centrally located rest room on the property where you can cool off and even charge your phone. Buy electronic tickets online and save a few dollars each vs the door price. Allow yourself at least 2 hours to see & digest all the exhibits but you could easily breeze through in an hour without feeling cheated. Bring your camera."
"Take a tour of this old prison, which is an historic place.  There is a guide, who explains details of what it was like to be incarcerated many years ago there about a century ago.  It actually stressed a manner of reform rather than punishment. Plan a tour ahead of time or check the schedule online or by phone to make sure visitors are allowed in the day you want to visit.  You will see the cells, the original flooring, the stairs snd doorways plus you will hear about an important part of history as regards prison system at the time in Philadelphia."
"This place was a perfect spooky season group event! The skits were so realistic and well executed. Wearing the necklaces limits your activity and if you're gonna go, might as well do it right! No necklaces!"
"The building itself is absolutely magnificent and beautifully preserved. It really is an incredible structure!Unfortunately, my rating is for the HORRENDOUS in-person tour my wife and I took when visiting the prison.I would like to preface this by saying that my wife and I are AVID visitors to historical sites, take historical tours, voraciously read history and watch documentaries...etc.With that being said, I have never in my life heard a tour guide speak so much and yet say so little. The tour was comprised of almost entirely rhetorical questions that you would ask a first grader. ""How would you FEEL about having a bag placed over your head?""...""Would it hurt to wear shackles?"".......""How would you FEEL about having to live in silence"".....""How would you FEEL about being forced to read the bible?"".... ""Would you FEEL scared?""...""Would you feel hungry if you weren't fed?""....... on and on and on. Even more awkward was the deafening silence that came after each absurd question as if expecting us to answer. There was zero substance, zero objective fact, just vapid rhetorical questions about feelings.We didn't take a tour to be asked rhetorical questions.....""how would I FEEL about being hungry and not being fed?"".....GEEZ, hmmm, that's a REAL tough question there.It was borderline insulting. Are we on a first grade tour here? Are we adults or are we children?Even more bizarre was a refusal to answer the most basic questions. I politely asked a question regarding a riot that occurred in 1961.  I received a response from the tour guide that went something like this:  ""Um, well, I do not want to upset you or members of the group....these were humans...this was inequity....we mustn't sit in judgment of these humans.....mmkay?""A nonsensical 'trigger warning' along with some inane comment about inequity and judgment?Are you kidding me, lady!???  THIS IS A PRISON!!!!  YES, TERRIBLE THINGS happened here! YES, believe it or not we CHOSE to come here and LEARN more in depth about the events that happened here! Even the bad things. Are we children? You need to sensor historical fact for us because you 'feel' it would be 'too upsetting'.  RIDICULOUS!Eventually my wife and I left about mid way through the tour. We couldn't take one more rhetorical question.This was by far the worst tour I have ever taken in my life, hard stop.I'm deeply disappointed we didn't just do the damn audio tour. I just found out that STEVE BUSCEMI narrates the audio tour?! We really missed out on that, man!To summarize, do yourself a favor....definitely DO VISIT Eastern State. Like I said the building is magnificent, it's very well restored. Even if you are not a fan of history the architecture is intriguing!  Just...whatever you do, do NOT take the in-person tour. Do the Steve Buscemi tour, ok? At least do it for me...., please just do it for me!"
"Wow, is all I can say!  The self guided tour is great, you can follow along by the number as it goes or you can skip around.   The info you get is great!  Stories from actual inmates and people who worked here.  Seeing the place now and hearing the stories you can imagine how it was and what it was like.  Of course the big attraction I suppose was knowing Al Capone was kept here at one time.  You can see the Cell(s) he was in and the info surrounding him is really something.  While it does a few bucks to do the tour it is well worth it and highly educational."
I would call this the Alcatraz of the East. The audio tour was very similar to the one at Alcatraz which I liked immensely. The stories they tell are very interesting and well laid out. Buying tickets was fast and easy. We spent about two hours here. We could have spent more time but it was so hot out that we were too pooped to continue.
Learned so much in the self guided audio tour about the growth of and the current prison system. Spent about two hours there and it was about perfect.
The audio tour really makes this experience.  Listening to the stories of the prisoners and workers brings the place to life.  It is a very interesting concept and very different from the modern penitentiary system.  The architecture and restored and abandoned cells are truly worth seeing.  The exhibit on modern prisons and reform programs was also thought provoking.
"What an intrigiung place.  Was concerned our teenagers would not like the visit, but they really enjoyed it.  Be prepared to walk.  Underestimated the size, but enjoyed every step.  So much history.  You get an complimentary audio set, which is outstanding at explain each stop.  I like how they have ""redone"" a few spots and then left most like it was.  Really interesting about how the philosophy changed over the years here and what they wanted to accomplish with those incarcerated.  So glad they kept this place and did not tear it down to build houses, hotels or stores.  I really enjoyed our visit and highly recommend it.  You'll need to be prepared to walk, but well worth it.  Got to see Al Capone cell, but honestly that was not the most interesting part. Just walking and listening to the audio about the history was very educational and interesting."
"Loved this , great commentary on the headset guide provided. Well laid out, and I like that they’ve left some of the cells in their derelict form.Staff dotted around were all informative and friendly."
"Lots of history in this penitentiary and worth the visit. Headphones are provided so you can walk around the property at your pace. Look for the numbered placard and put in the number to listen to life in the penitentiary.  It makes it easy to learn a lot.  Once you do the basic guide, walk around and find more numbers. Also, stop by the indoor displays by the ball field."
Arrive early in the summer months as it is cooler and not as crowded. The tour is a self guided audio with great information as to the history of the prison and it’s prisoners. Tour took about 1.5 hours. You get a discount on tickets if you pre-purchase online.
"Great place to visit for history!!! Kind of spooky, but the tour was good! Make sure you wear comfortable shoes."
"I was so intrigued by this entire tour. Loved that you were able to go at your own pace, we weren't rushed at all & we learned so much about this part of history that was both shocking and enlightening."
Even more interesting than Alcatraz. Audio tour is a necessity to get the full experience. Give yourself a minimum of two hours as there is a lot to see.
Interesting overview of the first penitentiary. Well laid out. Great audio recordings. Don’t miss the tunnel and Al Capones cell. Close parking.
"I was really surprised by how interesting this museum is. It’s a really interesting site with a lot of deep history to it. There are a lot of staff around who are very helpful, and the audio tour was very well done. I think a lot of really good research and work in general has gone into the museum. I don’t think it would be great for young children, just because of the nature of a prison being potentially upsetting. I would say maybe middle school and up? We stuck around to see pretty much all of the additional audio tour stops that are not on the 35 minute main circuit, and I think in total we spent about 2 1/2 hours. I think it would be hard to spend much longer. Do be aware that most of the facility is not climate controlled because it is either outdoors or in corridors that are open to the outside. So dress appropriately, but go! It’s great and you will learn a lot."
Eastern State Pen. is a great place to visit that has a lot of crazy history and exciting facts. I believe it was the very first State Pen and the first Pen. to incorporate solitary confinement. Many other famous prisons around the world were modeled after this place. If you are lucky you might even hear a ghost from the past.
"Found this place fascinating, well worth a visit! Would recommend the guide tours to get the next level of detail."
"Went with a 15 year old and 2 12 year olds.  We were all entertained and found it both interesting and eerie inside.  The self guided audio tour seemed to move too slow for us and we skipped over a lot of the stops, but what we did listen to had informative information and stories about life in the prison.  We will return again in warmer weather as it in not climate controlled at all.  Neat to see the way it is deteriorating and the way they are keeping it in its natural state of decay.  Worth the trip there, Fairmount Park is also a very nice area to check out with your family"
Very instructive for all ages. Try to have at least 3 hours to visit. It is close to the Rodin and Museum of Art so you can combine these together.
