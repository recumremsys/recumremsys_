"Dhanushkodi when translated means ""end of the bow"". The site of confluence of blue and green waters of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal is absolutely breathtaking. It is connected with the original Indian mainland only by the Pamban Railway Bridge.  The place has been reduced to ruins and mystic stories today due to a cyclone in 1964,which had the intensity to destroy the city.On a clear day,you can view the Srilankan coast from here.Though, it is just 18-20 Kms from Rameshwaram,there are no restrooms or hotels here .Though vendors are aplenty selling cool masala cumbers and watermelons. Do carry umbrellas ,sunscreens and drinking water.Loved the shoreline,blue sky and  the confluence of two major seas. In route ,there were quaint and picturesque fishermen Hamlets..They had loads of shops selling some very good stuffmade of shells ."
"Dhanushkodi the tip of India where Indian Ocean and Arabian sea merges is the place from Ram Seth bridge was formed has a tearful history behind it.  During 1964 cyclone the entire dhanushkodi was merged under sea.  The  damaged portions of the church, railway station and few more buildings in the elevated place are standing as  memorials for the incident.  As there was no census taken in 5hose days Noone could assess the actual number of deaths but several hundreds of dead bodies floating in the sea proved the death should be more than 1500.For several years reaching the point was difficult due to bad roads but thanks to the central government  who have laid excellent road two years back and you can reach the point in 30 mts drive.  Autos, taxis are available from rameshwaram.  But see to that you go before 4 pm otherwise you will be denied to go near the tip.  Do not miss."
"Earlier there were no roads to go to arichamunai, the lands end where three sides are covered by water. The old Danushkodi is like walking back into history. The destroyed buildings of the church, railway station & post office in the 1964 cyclone stand testimony of what happened to this place. To go to Arichamunai previously there werent any roads and you have to either walk or take 4 wheel drive vans or jeeps that were available. Now the govt has laid road till Arichamunai and you can drive down in your own vehicle.The place will amaze you with its scenic beauty. Evening or early morning is the best time to go as it becomes too hot in the mid day. Be careful not to venture into the sea as its dangerous and ppl have lost lives here. Though one side will be calm(known as woman sea) and the other side will be with waves(known as male sea) its better not to go far into the waters. Swimming is now banned.The drive leading to Arichamunai is very beautiful as you dont get to see this kind of landscape anywhere else. The road leading from Rameswaram to Danushkodi is beautiful too. At some places you can get down and walk into the shallow back waters for pictures."
The end point where Bay of about Bengal and Indian Ocean meet (Confluence) about 27 km from Rameswaram. Open only between 7 am till 5pm.Note the timings.
Have visited Sangamam where both bay of Bengal and Indian ocean meets. Its only place in Asia where you will be standing in Indian shore and getting mobile Tower or service from srilanka Airtel.
"Awesome place at the tip, beautiful ocean ..it gets quite hot.  headed off to dhanushkodi, its awesome with ocean on both sides and the narrow road in between, at the end is where we can park car and go to the ocean. there is also a nice temple in between.also enroute you canâ€¦"
The beach where the three oceans come together. Also used by the locals for religious baths. From a distance it has pretty shades of green. Has pretty much a sandy beach.
"This is only abondoned town in India . We can see the tip near Ramsethu . The road will be opened by 6:15 am and closed by 5.00pm . The ruins of Dhanushkodi will tell the past history of 1964 , 1948 .. . Can taste the local fish on road side restaurants . Searched for traces ofâ€¦"
"Opened some time back, the road from rameshwaram right to the end of dhanushkodi until the last point of the beach is just amazing. Driving on a small stretch of land with water.on both sides. Color of water is diff on either side and th waves behave diff too. This is a must do and something I am keen on doing again ðŸ˜Š"
Drive till here in early morning (for sunrise) is good experience.  Beach on one side is clam and on the other side is opposite. Awesome experience of driving between the ocean on both the side.
"On the way to Dhanushkodi, there will be the destructed churches, houses and buildings, and some shops which sells various crafts made of seashells like chains, bracelets etc.  Crossing this, you will reach the Main attraction : Dhanushkodi Beach, which is the end. You will feelâ€¦"
Visited this site where left side is Bay of Bengal and right is Indian Ocean. Left is very windy and seemd rough waters while the opposite is true for right side. Where the two meets creates a colliding waves like it is hitting the shore.
We were a family of four adults.Beautiful sight of the last point in India.rolling waves add to the breathtaking views of the ocean.  With so many tourists visiting this place it lacks a toilet.  The drive to the point is amazing.  Incredible India.  Regards Udhbir Singh
"The drive to Dhanushkodi is a good experience.  One one side the sea water is calm and on the other it is not. The place is clean. Walk on the clean sands.  One should go a bit early. We reached there at about 5 pm. After 5.30, the police do not allow people there as a safetyâ€¦"
Where the Bay of Bengal meets the Indian ocean and the vista is super fabulous.Avoid weekends to avoid disappointment because of mad rush. Beware of pufferfish on the Indian ocean side.
"Visited on 17th Dec,2019. Danushkodi beach the end point where you can go via Jeeps is closed for public now and not allowed as of now. You can go upto 5km before and park the vehicle and  walk for and see the ruins etc. But disappointed as not able to go to end!"
Hidden gem of India. Worth the 4 km walk from the vehicle drop off point. Try to go early morning or around sunset time. Don't miss when in Rameshwaram. 
"One of cleanest beach of India. Situtated around 20 kms away from Rameswaram, this one is end point of India from where Sri Lanka is almost 60-70 kms away through sea route. This one is the ghost town which is due to 1960s Tsunami. You will not allowed to stay beyond 5 pm. Haveâ€¦"
"It is very scenic, no  bias on Ram setu angle, but should visit for it's beauty. It has nice drivable road, can drive till end, and occasionaly will be welcome by Sirlanka Airtel. Recomend to travel either early moring or in evening, mid noon it is tool hot, swimming is notâ€¦"
Had visited this place with my better half while visiting the Rameshwaram Temple. I could not see any floating rocks. Its a place worth seeing.
"Must see place if you are going to Rameshwaram. You can drive your own vehicle to the end point of the land in Rameshwaram and on the way you can see some old buildings and church that has been destroyed in 1964/65 cyclone. Spend some time on the beach and if you put on your google maps, you will be amazed to see how the land narrow downs as you move towards the tip point."
"Neat and clean beaches. Drive from Rameswaram to Danushkodi is memorable. Peaceful place, must visit."
Visiting Holya  place like Rameshwaram would be great blessing and worthy pilgrimage to be at this Jyothirlinga Temple. This ancient temple built in an Island with great sculpture and grandeur really mesmerizes. Its historical and mythological significance reveals the mightinessâ€¦
"Visited mid-morning. Views of both oceans (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) stunning. However, traffic causes major obstructions. Many road-side vendors selling fruit and ice cream, but the site is not well cared for and suffers from excessive littering. No toilets. Warnings against bathing because of the undertow. Glad to have seen where the India- Sri Lanka land bridge once was."
Trip to Dhanushkodi Beach involves 35 minutes drive from Rameswaram. Start early for a wonderful view of the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean side by side. Don't go in the evening hours as u are not allowed to go. I guarantee you will have a spectacular experience on board.Theâ€¦
Visited in morning about 10 am. The road leading to the point is superb sea on both the sides the colour of water is just so beautiful it takes your tiredness away. You have to walk atleast 500 meters to reach the last point of Dhanushkodi. There is a telescope which shows youâ€¦
"It was great experience for seeing dhanushkodi beach and knowing all the facts of Ramayana.we were very happy for seeing this place as ,we can  see the Sri lanka border from dhanushkodi is only 13 km. enjoying alot for knowing all the facts of ramayna, and dhanushkodi beachâ€¦"
"While you are still young and can appreciate nature at its best go there.Driving through to Dhanushkodi will definitely through the iconic Pamban bridge. You would have a spectacular view of the ocean from there. I went there from chennai , so what am used to see is waves that carry lot of dirt in them. To some extent I thought thats how the sea would be even inside, given that we send all pollutants to the sea. That perception changed completely there. I went with family there so they wanted to go to temple. Nothing wrong against that, but I just preferred to go to dhanushkodi beach again so went in twice. Place is not commercialized so you wont find big eateries, its actually good else the place will end up having lots of plastic pollution. Except for few 'cut fruit' selling vendors you wont find any commercialized activity.The place does not have electricity, and its not needed as well for us since tourists wont be allowed to go post 4-5 PM. Post that place its only local residents who have got prior permission to be there. Now coming to the beach- Since the road to beach point goes deep into the sea, you would see the sea in its actual Blue color, step inside water and you would see water so clear that you can see your feet so clearly. Since there is not much pollution the beach sand is clean and white. The road to the beach point is narrow, so if you are driving then you have to go all the way till police allow you and take a U turn. On holiday season expect lot of crowd and finding a parking spot for your vehicle may be difficult (not a nightmare still). Every other driver would understand your problem as they too would face the same problem. Expect no mobile signal from indian mobile co. You may pick up Airtel from Srilanka. Unless you want to cook up your mobile bill and god forbid some problem from indian authorities, never connect to that. The only mobile signal I got is BSNL and that too getting substantiially into our main land but not in Dhanushkodi.The local fish market person had a small stage on a big staircase, I was wondering the purpose and he explained that its for getting a mobile signal :-) . He went on to explain that normal feature phone has better reception and smartphone wont work there. Apart from battery life this was the first time I heard a smart phone losing to feature phone.  You can walk till the end where there is an ashoka pillar and a round about around it. someone told to me that you can see srilanka from there, I tried hard but could not. May be in the night we could see some light from srilanka, but you wont be allowed to stay in Dhanushkodi beach point post 5 pm anyways. I blamed it on the High seas for not being able to see SrilankaJust go for it if you are a nature lover and want to see the ocean at its best."
"Known for being the beautiful beach of the ghost town , the Dhanuskodi beach offers a very memorable lifetime experience. It's the place where the waters of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal meet. The beach along with the town is a major tourist attraction in Tamil Nadu. Theâ€¦"
Visited this place on 28th Feb 2020 and spend some time. Quite peaceful and can be called as South-End end point from where Sri Lanka is around 20kms. The drive to beach point is also good. Worth to visit.
Come for the ruins of the town destroyed in 1964 by the cyclone. Also take a look at the beach (no swimming--even if the locals are) and the fishermen's thatched houses. Enjoy the drive along the thin sliver of beach that runs for miles until it hits a busy end point where someâ€¦
"Heard lot about Dhanushkodi from travellers on the beauty of this place However I didnâ€™t found anything mesmerising except the drive to this place. If you have your own conveyance, then you should visit this place. There is road along with sea which is breathtaking - on the wayâ€¦"
Driving on a small strip of land with sea on both sides is a surreal experience. Thought that this perhaps is the place where Rama and his army worked to build a bridge on the ocean makes it magical.  Its an awesome destination and must-visit in Rameshwaram.
"A very beautiful beach, that was once a happening hub of many activites! Having been washed away by a storm in 1964, the remains narrate a very sad story! The beach in itself is such a beauty that one would not want to move out of this place! Only families that survived the 1964 cyclone are inhabitants of this beautiful sea hamlet! The last time we went, that is 4 years back, there were no such roads that took us to the beach. We had to get down and take a TUV that was driven on the sand. Now, there are good roads and the vehicles take us till the beach. Do visit the remains of the storm..An old church, the post office, the old railway station and do check from the local inhabitants about Dhanushkodi. You would leave with a very heavy heart!"
One of the rare places in and around Rameshwaram where you will find a clean beach. Not far away from SL. Your mobile may switch to international roaming here.Drive to the place is a bliss. Abandoned town adds to the appeal.
