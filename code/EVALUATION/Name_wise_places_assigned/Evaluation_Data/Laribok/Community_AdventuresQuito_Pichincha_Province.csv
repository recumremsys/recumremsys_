I did the food tour and the Otavalo Day Tour. Both were really great and well organised. Would reccomend both for people who would like to discover Quito and the area around! Keep up the good work!
"Stumbled onto community adventures thru do the free walking tour - which was excellent!  But the full day tour of Quilotoa was superb and at a great price $50.  Also covered off a local market - corn fritters and cheese pretty delicious breakfast, and a canyon whose name escapes…"
Did a day trip to Otavalo Saturday market and I really enjoyed it. Our guide Romer had so much knowledge about the area and Ecuador as a whole. Great day! 
"Community Adventures helped set up a day trip to Baños for me and a group of friends which included transportation, lodging, and optional excursions. Had a great time, highly recommended."
"During my stay at Community Hostel I had the chance to do the amazon trip. I went in the jungle for three days and it was just an unforgetable experience. Driving on a boat through the great Amazonas, viewing the most beautiful nature, the incredible looking sky and just the…"
"I went into the jungle with Community Adventures, I was staying at the hostel & the whole process couldn't have been easier!! Including getting to and from the National Park. The lodge was perfect & I can speak for all 4 of us that went, the food was a highlight!! Our guides…"
"Walking tour was well worth it. It is free (not incl tip) and really allowed us to get our bearings in Old Town. Quilotoa tour was good - beautiful place, great tour guide and interesting stops along the way. 4/5 as they mixed up our pick up which made us a bit squezzed at…"
"Booked my last minute Galapagos-cruise via Community adventures. Besides the trip being unforgettable, the quoted price was great, and they were reachable trough email and whatsapp with superfast and friendly response. In short, highly recommended for people looking for a good…"
"Was somewhat disappointed with the middle of the world tour. The bus driver was great and gave us extra information about the areas we were visiting, however at the actual site, the guide there was very rushed and fast paced. We saw a lot of the items and demonstrations, however…"
Did 2 tours through this agency and both were really good.  The free walking tour with Andrea went for a couple of hours and she provided us plenty of information about the city. Visited a number of spots and most places we able to revisit afterwards.  The Middle of the World…
"Had a free afternoon and decided to join the Free Walking tour out of the Community Hostel. It is one of the best tours I've been on. Our guide as ""OB"" and spoke great english and was very knowledgeable about all aspects of Quito and Ecuador. Visited a wide range of attractions…"
Had an amazing day with Community Adventures on the Cotopaxi day trip. The guides were really good and the trip was very well organized. Would definitely recommend.

"Community adventures were great in helping us organise a trip to the Amazon! The 4 day, 3 night stay was great. The food was very good and the private room we had was great too.  Keep in mind two of the included days will be long travel days, so you may want to stay longer to…"
"I really enjoyed the food and beer tour, it was one of the highlights of my trip to Quito, a wonderful introduction to its culture. Started with good beer, had some unusual local food and ended up with salsa (not part of the tour, but the guide kindly took us to Democrático 2).…"
"Exceeded all expectations!! We had the best time! Booking was easy and Santiago from the tour office was a star!  Dolphin Lodge was very clean, comfortable and had lots of space to hang out. The food was amazing, everyday was different but always delicious. Everyday was filled…"
Did the walking tour and Cotopaxi tour. Both good fun. Adventure tours staff are very friendly and helpful.
Community Adventures helped us plan out entire stay in Quito! Staying at the Community Hostel it is very convenient to have the agency located right downstairs. We only had a week in Quito so having the planned tours helped us make the most out of our stay! Thanks Community…
"We did 3 tours. The walking tour, which we found a little boring. We left at the break, as many people on the tour did. There was about 30 people, you could hardly hear and I felt it was overload of info. Standing at times for 20 min listening. Too long for me.  We got the mini…"
"Had a great time in the jungle, me and my girlfriend stayed at guacamaya lodge. The tour was brilliant, very well informed guides and we saw a vast range of animals. The lodge itself was clean and comfortable, and the food was great. "
"Booked a Galapagos trip through Community Adventures and it was simply amazing! One of my best wildlife adventures so far. The people I booked the tour with were so nice, and were able to answer all of my questions. They're not annoyingly trying to sell you stuff, but are very…"
"Booked five different tours with community adventures: free walking tour, Mitad del Mundo, Otavalo Market, Cotopaxi and Quilotoa. Each trip was fantastic and as advertised. Great transport, wonderful guides and relaxed atmosphere. I emailed a lot beforehand and always received a…"
"Our tour guide (lovely lady but I cannot remember now) was fantastic! Gave a great insight into Quito culture, politics, sights, stories! Would highly recommend!!"
Did the Otavalo market day trip which was wonderful.  The tour guide did an excellent job of explaining the overall day's agenda and each stop.  Had plenty of time to visit each site and never felt rushed.  The lunch was excellent.  Highly recommend.  This was by far the best…
"We did a 3 hour city tour, and learned a lot about Quito and Ecuador.  Guide was great, lots of info (but NOT overload).  Note tour goes up and down hills in the city, so some people may find it difficult."
"Had an awesome time on the jungle tour, would highly recommend. Guides were excellent, and the accommodation of a good standard. "
"Amazing, the guides were super professionals. Kudos to Luis and Frank .  Breakfast included before arriving at Cotopaxi. The guide ( Luis)  stood up all the time explaining great things about Ecuador . The bikes were a bit old but worked. Don't forget to chew coca leaves, at…"
Priced very good for the convenience only $10.00 each and the free tour was very informative. We walked the downtown area and learn about the history of Ecuador.
"Booked 4 day Amazon adventure to Cuaybeno national park staying at Dolphin lodge with community adventures and couldnt be happier. Every part of the trip was professionally organised and run, boat trips/skipper was amazing, accommodation cosy, food best I had in Ecuador and the…"
Absolutely loved this day trip! Exceeded expectations! Very authentic and we did so much! Loved the market! The quilatoa creates was also so stunning! Loved the photo stops on the way too (e.g Ecuador’s largest canyon and and Cotopaxi etc) Highly recommend! 
"I did three tours with Community Adventures; Quito walking tour, Quilotoa, and Galapagos land tour. The first two tours were nice. The walking tour gave a great overview and history of both Quito and Ecuador. Loved have Champi (guides dog) along for the walk. Quilotoa was a fun…"
Had a great time on the Quilatoa tour. Well organized and the guide had lots of information about the region. I just wish we had a bit more time at Quilatoa. Before Quilatoa we stopped at a local market which was nice but could have been cut out for more time at Quilatoa.
I did the Mindo Cloud Forest tour with them and it was incredible! The guide was very knowledgeable and the activities were so much fun. Hiking through the forest and zip lining gave incredible views. The only thing I would say is there are a lot of errands costs so if it could…
