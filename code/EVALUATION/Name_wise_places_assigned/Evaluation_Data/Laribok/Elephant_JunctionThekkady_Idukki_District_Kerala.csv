Entertaining. Enjoyed a lot. Elephant ride is a very wonderful experience of my life.Must go place.
It was fun to ride an elephant.. Elephant Bath was a very enjoyable activity. The female elephants are nicely trained do its safe to visit and ride them. Enjoyed this activity a lot
This is a very good place to visit with children. Go for the one hour ride it is better. Very clean place
"Took a 30 mins ride, but felt pity for the elephants. Not suitable for animal lovers. Ride is also expensive"
"Took 3 elephants for the kids to go with their mothers, a well enjoying ride for close to 30 minutes. the seats are strong enough to hold the weight and a mahout is there for support"
"Very good and unique experience. Positives* You can interact closely with elephants.* The place is situated in natural surroundings.* Elephants seem to be well-treated.Negatives* Though well-treated, the elephants are still in captivity; hence the place might not be suitable for hard-core animal lovers.The staff all seem very respectful and clearly spend a lot of time with the elephants. Recommended."
We were here for Elephant ride. Enjoyed a lot. The man handling the elephants took our lot of good pictures. Totally worth it.
Had a wonderful experience at 🐘 junction... Kids enjoyed bathing elephant and elephant shower... If going in Holiday season...please pre-book the ride
"Very good place... Watching the elephants activities, specially bathing is awesome.... The elichi plantation and elephant ride in the kachcha road through it.... The mahut was friendly and made the elephant giving various posture for taking photography.... Cafeteria is there but we haven't tried anything there.... Clean toilet are there..."
The wait times are horrible and this is a rather expensive activity but its an experience none the less and it was average. Makes for some good photographs
Took 30 minutes elephant ride through plantation. Actually the rider was around 20 min. Overall experience was average and overpriced though children mat enjoy this activity.
Great visit. Booked for 1.5 hr experience. Be warned you will get wet. Luckily we had change if clothing with us! Fab elephant ride - though a bit daunting as this was bare back & told to hang on!!! Great fun.
"Feel like king riding on elephant. The mahuts are friendly people. Took my camera and clicked many pictures while making the elephant pose with trunk raised. Bought some bananas from nearby stall and fed the elephant. There are stalls selling bananas for elephant feeding. The kids were thrilled to ride and feed the elephant.  There is also provision for elephant shower where the elephant will shower with water over you which costs around Rs 1000 extra. Bathrooms are available for after shower clean up. (Do check whether the seat is tightly buckled up. While getting down from the elephant, found that we has slid off a little)"
Visited elephant junction during our stay in thekkedy Kerala. It was our first experience for elephant ride. Though it was short but very exciting. The charges for ride are 400 per person. They also provide 1 hour jungle safari and bath with elephant services.
"Superb place  to visit,  really  my children and my family  enjoyed  a lot. Thank you lekshmi for the nice ride with us.... "
Took an elephant ride with two toddlers. It was very comfortable and safe. The elephants are well trained.
"The Elephant Junction had about 8 elephants when we visited the place. They offer different packages with elephant ride ,  showering the elephants & showering by the elephant,  timber picking, feeding the elephant and other activities.You can design your own package according to your wish. The package cost varies from Rs. 800 to Rs. 1500 per person for different rides. Showering by the Elephants was the best experience ever after scrubbing the elephant, you sit on top and the elephant showers you with water from his trunk. They also provide you with towels and changing room. Complementary Tea/ Coffee is also available after taking ride."
"Very expensive for what it was and didn’t feel 100% comfortable or confident the elephants were being looked after well. Paid for a 2 hour “experience” ride lasted no more than 5mins and it was all over in 1 hour. They say their having “problems” with the forest department and should have walked then and got a refund but they convinced us to stay, definitely regret this decision"
This is the best elephant ride i have ever gone. The elephants are tamed very well and it listens to each and every word of the care taker. Don't ever think of missing this.
Made the bookings from Chitrashala homestay ... Enjoyed the elephant rides thru the jungle...shower with the elephant was just too good.! Gave a scrub to ‘Meera’..also Fed the elephant.. Had coffee and biscuits at the small canteen .. chill out time .. very relaxing…
"Superb experience  For Indian ride don’t matter a lot , but giving bath to elephant and taking elephant shower must do experience   It’s cost us ₹ 700 per person for elephant bath , shower and elephant feeding.  Kids below 5 years are free .  Make sure u have booking done as for…"
"Went to Elephant Junction with my family (4 yr old kid). There are many other Elephant parks but this is no doubt better than others. Also if you are doing Munnar and Thekkady both, dont go to the elephant park in Munnar but go here instead.Rs 400 for 20-25 minute ride --> completely safe and worth itRs 1250 package --> 1.5 hours, Elephant ride, bath, shower (u can sit on top of elephant and elephant will shower with clean water), elephant feeding and photo session with elephantsElephant shower is the best part... not to be missedSPECIAL NOTE:* Try to go in 1st half. it rains a lot in 2nd half and you might get stuck with a ride in rain or  shower cancelled due to rain* If you have kids (any age above 3 yrs), DO NOT MISS THIS* Completely safe and comfortable"
"We visited when we were in thedakky to Elephant camp. This is near Elephant route Hotel. We took Elephant ride and Elephant bath package it was 1000 per head , but believe me its worth it. It starts with Elephant ride and a photo shoot with Elephant. Later they shall take to another Elephant whose lying in the pond . Later we were asked to Brush Elephant. My kid was first afraid to touch him but later he was enjoying bathing Elephant. Next part was awesome ..now it’s Elephant turn.. here the excitement started.. we asked to sit on Elephant and he started showering is with Trunk... !!! Until we said stop stop .. It ends with Photo session with him...Go there and have fun. Don’t just read."
"Enjoyed alot, we did elephant ride, elephant bath, elephant shower, elephant feeding, elephant photo session, coffee tea session. We bought elephant hair for rings!   We were literally like kids, enjoyed alot with our 3 year old son. Amazing Experience. We were Grip of 5 adults…"
Must Enjoy Elephant Ride when visiting Munnar / Thekkady. Safe and Good. Walk is in Nature.Small and Enjoyable.
"We did two hour program. Included 1 hour ride (no chains on elephants legs), work demonstration, an informational briefing on elephants (anna) and best of all getting to wash, scrub, pet, hug and get showered by Mira. We didn’t know to bring change of clothing but they provided towels!!"
Elephant ride priced at Rs. 400 per person. Mentioned 20 minutes ride. But ride gets over in 7 minutes.  But enjoyable . The time duration is excusable considering the continuous rides that these animals are made to provide. Also their food expenses are high. God bless them.But worth the experience especially if going with kids 6-7 years and above.
We had a great time at this place. The elephant ride was fun as was helping with cleaning Jamba in her bath.  We also had chance to feed her with large pieces of melon.  However what made it really memorable was shower time. Sitting on Jamba’a back and repeatedly getting blasted…
Although I don't generally like seeing animals in captivity the elephants at this park seemed to be well cared for and looked after. Washing the elephant and getting up close was just fabulous as she was wonderful. 
"This is my 1st Elephant ride in my life. We visited the Elephant camp as a main attraction in Thekkady. The ride was for 20 mints into the forest.  Mr. Prabhath was my guide of the day and sweet Lakshmi, the female elephant was calm and beautiful. This attraction is great for families. You can take photos with elephants and trainers. SEE photos."
"Looks like very simple to do elephant ride. But, it is really painful, every step taken by giant is like travelling in auto especially on pot holes road. You can do this activity once to get the real feel of travelling on animals. Next, is you should stretch your legs almost 170…"
"We did a fantastic half day experience with the elephants. The ride is a bit long, but the washing and feeding experience is excellent! Be there early to avoid the crowds"
Really good. Did a half day which included a sari dressing and talk on cardamon preparation in addition to the elephant walk and bathing. Elephants are rescue animals.Recommended
"loved the time spent with the elephant named Meenakshi, 17 year old elephant. an obedient and friendly elephant, she loved her bath and scrubbing."
"2 hours 30 minute wait for a 25min ride on a abused elephant with chains. Everything was arranged (and paid) weeks before, so a very disappointing experience. The animals are beautiful though, but I would never visit such a place again. Going to look for a glimpse off them in the wild! There are wild elephants very close by this place, do yourself and the animals a favor and go there!"
