Very poor experience... every corner there is someone begging aka demanding money in a so called holy place. Disgusting to say the least that officials have no rules in place.
"Beautiful dargah, peaceful place to go and pray .. all religious denomination people come here. if u are tourist ..  PLEASE NOTE -- Once inside lots of people try to con you to take you to people with registers and extract money from you. DONT GO TO THESE FOLKS, GO TO THE MAINâ€¦"
"Once upon a time Khwaja rested here...but now it's polluted...polluted place and minds. You will find people tying threads and asking for money, covering your head with some silk cloth and asking for money...and there are groups. Looks like Puri Dham 25 years back. Each groupâ€¦"
"People of all religions go there.Its not a tourist spot, its a place of faith. Go there expecting that.Dress conservatively"
Its really an amazing place. I have visited ever. Crowded but best holy place to visit peoples of all religion. I love to visit again.
The path leading to this place is very narrow and dirty. parking is another issue. Very crowded. Requires special faith to visit.
It's a heaven place on Aimer. Feel so blessed to come here. Spent maximum time at Dargah Sharif. Great...
"Not easy to negotiate all the people. Pushed and shoved. So over crowded and everyone wants your money.  Lined up for 30 minutes to get in, amid I guess 100 people all pushing you out of the way and jumping the queue. The old ladies were the worst, thumping me on the back with their fists and pushing me sideways.  So unpleasant. Once inside everyone wanted money from us. Gave a $5 donation to the first one then was ushered through very quickly without really seeing anything.  Being a westerner and unwilling to part with any more money we weren't wanted there.  Nothing much to see in the very small shrine, just a glance at the sufi. Very beautiful flowers decorating the outside of the shrine though.An unpleasant experience and probably not worth the wait."
always good to visit Mazaars and mosque whilst on holiday. spend half and hour there. facilities for ladies as well.
One can find huge crowds at everytime of the year. Beware of pickpockets. Otherwise the place is very peaceful and relaxing.
"Had terrible experience on 15.10.2018 evening visit.  Given the historical importance of this Darghah and tag of world famous place, I was eager to visit the place.  I had awful experience. Visited the place with family. A muslim priest ( Khadim) approached and wanted to help in getting visit properly for 100 bucks. I said fine. He warned me of mobile and purse, I kept my purse on front pocket & had nothing much to do abut mobile except being alert and holding tightly. We followed him for the main Dargah and another guy joined him. They kept looking  guiding me.  When we approached the dargah it was completely messed up with crowed from all sised. He forced us to enter the crowd and asked to stand in one corner and asked us to pray Allaha and ask for something, we stayed there for 1 minute and moved away he guided us to come towards other side of the Dargah while moving I realized my cell phone was gone. I immediately checked all my reamaining valuables and asked my wife to check her phone and other stuff. I too her phone to call my number it rang for 3 times and then went off. I left the premises hoping to save what ever is left.  Shocked and  disappointed moving out of Dargah. The  guy who was helping me joined and started  reminding me that he alerted me.  Not left with anyother option I wanted to give a police compliant asked him to guide me to police stations. I went to Ajmer Police station for the complaint was surprised to see 4 people ( 3 female and 1 male) already crying in tears in police station as they have been robed off their smart phone and all the money they had for the trip. I gave the complaint and asked the cops that this seems to be an organized crime. I was alert still someone took away the phone and there are many others. Not much response from them. I think we understand how this works. Sad and dejected not that I lost my expensive smart phone, more as1. A place  where people come from around the world is surrounded by organized criminals. 2. Police is in-effective. 3. No crowd management inside the main Dargah4. No management If you want to tour the place, can give complete miss as it's not safe and there are antisocial elements active and no security to control them.  If you have religious aspect can avoid entering main dargah as this is place where all wrong things can happen due to unman aged crowd."
Been to  Dargah Sarif on 22 Oct 2018. What a place ðŸ˜‘. Felt very close to the Asia's First Dargah Sarif. Found that almost 90% were non-muslim. Very ancient (800) years of history.
Access to this place is very narrow and crowded. Private vehicles have to be left at far place and you have to take an auto to reach the place.Too much crowd near the place and there in no proper arrangement for queue/ line. Beware of thieves. Do not wear any valubles/â€¦
"Very nice place to visit. Its one of the most religious place for Muslims but mostly all communities visit there. Tourists , celebrities etc. People say if someone has a wish to fulfill, go and visit Dargah shariff . Put  â€˜Chadarâ€™ ( the holy cloth) and some flowers and wishâ€¦"
Good place to visit garib Nawaz. Approach to shrine congested and dirty. Touts harass u. Visited Pushkar temple also. Nice but small temple
"Holy place and must visit. We parked our vehicle at Ganj area parking with 100rs charges. From there auto wala charged 200rs to and fro amount for taking us to main gate. We preferred going via auto, they took us through small galis. After reaching main gate people nearby will sorround you and start asking to buy chadar etc.Depending on  wish one can buy chadar. We bought chadar of 200rs and flowers of 100rs. After that be in the lane and from that point onwards people will literally force you and ask for money at every point. Dont panic and just politely ignore.Don't give any money to those guys. Donate to the board with proper receipt if you wish to in the dargah itself for betterment."
Had a wonderful experience there!! Got inner peace of mind here and I am sure you will also get!!Here every wish come true!! Must visit!!
"We visited the Dargah Shariff on 21.Nov. ,17. The place attracts peopleâ€™s from all over the world. The place as a kind of charisma in it. Peopleâ€™s do come out here with lots of wishes. If youâ€™re are planning to visit this place, prepare yourself to face beggars, agents and many more...The best way to avoid them is donâ€™t talk to them and avoid eye contact with them. Donâ€™t argue with them."
Nice to witness another spiritual side of India. come with long pants and head cover. Cameras in the bag
The place is centrally located in Ajmer & few points that the people should keep in mind is that just keep looking down & enter the dargah else there are local priest that will keep coming to you for money for darshan. Deposit your shoes to the last shop before the main gate of dargah you can take shoes till that shop whatever the locals may say as I wrote just keep looking down & go. Buy your offering & enter dargah & only go to the main retling place the priest might take you to other places where they'll ask you to make money offerings but best avoid it as it's of no use. Just go to main dargah & give your offerings with money on top INR 100 should work. Than come out sit there at the steps or hall for few minutes & come back. Best time to visit is evening.
"Went there witn family in December 2018. The place was not crowded until afternoon. Took an auto near the power house to teh Dehli gate.  they charged INR 50. You have to walk for about 700 meters from Dehli gate to reach the shrine. There are shops along the way and the people would literally pull you to their shop for safe keeping of the shoes and in the hope that you'll but the flowers/chadar/garlands from their shop. DO NOT stop until you have reached the gate of the shrine. Once you reach the gate of the shrine, you have to take your shoes off and take them in your hands. There are shops just inside the shrine where you can keep your shoes. Shoe storage is free of charge and it is entirely upto you if you want to buy any offering. The visit to the main chamber when the sufi saint lies peacefully gets over pretty soon. There are people around the shrine who'll pull you and read some enchanted lines and touch your head with a kind of peacock feathered broom. Once done, they'll ask for money. DO NOT go to these people even if it seems that they are calling specifically to you. Overall it was a fun visit. But be aware about the people who'll literally pull you towards them and then ask for money."
As it is very famous it too crowdy also.  Donâ€™t purchase costly  Chaddars  and prasad from there . Please donâ€™t purchase  sohan halwa from the shops besides the dargah as they are so unhygienic and cheap in price . Please purchase from good shop.
"As its is famous all over India, thought to visit this dargah and here was my experience.Pros:Cons:1. From 1 km before Dargah, people stop you to park the car. They charge 150 Rs per hour for car parking. Donot take your car there.2. For just less than 1 km, the autos charge 150 rs one way and 300 rs to go and come back from dargah. Its way toooooo much. All autowala do same.3. Inside Dargah also, they keep asking donations everywhere and want good donation.4. Its very very crowded place.5. For keeping shoes, they charge 20 rs. Pros:NothingTerrible experience. Do not visit this greedy area."
"Crowded entry to the Durgah. The walk to the Durgah is quite an experience with crowds that you are unlikely to experience elsewhere. Once inside the Durgah, the ""official"" people are asking for money left-right-and-center. After the darshan, beggers accompany you for a long, long time. However, it is a must-do item for everyone travelling to Ajmer."
Visited this place in the evening. It was flooded with people. There are various vendors outside the mosque where you can store your footwear and buy flowers and blankets.
"One can easily spend a whole day here. Its very peaceful. Made with white marble. Its looks very beautiful. Its has seven gates, but only 3-4 are functional for safety reasons. Its open day and night. However, the Darbaar sharif closes at night. Do not carry huge bags, theâ€¦"
"The experience of my visit to this place was really good. The place have a huge gathering of people and most of the time you may feel that you are being driven by the flow of so many people. The entry and exit point is same and sometimes it creates lot of problem as there is no crowd management. Luckily the person who escorted us from the shop from where we took the offering (prasad and chaddar) was really a good man and guided us well for the darshan. He asked us to wait even when the people were pushing hard to get in. We waited for his instruction and when the crowed really got reduced he signaled us to proceed. There are many beggars and people selling things on the street but we had no problems of misshaping with us. May be we were extra cautious from the several reviews that we had gone through. We really went ""light"" to this place. There was always a word of caution from people starting from hotel followed by the auto-rickshaw man that we hired to go to this place and there was constant announcement over the loud speaker. Overall it was a great experience. Looking forward to visit again in near future."
"We visited around 9am and there were not too many crowds and we seemed to be the only foreign tourists. Women must cover their head and wear long sleeves and not show any skin. The Sufi shrine is a very interesting holy site. We were prepared to donate money to the good cause of feeding the poor. We were ushered to a desk where the guy was writing in a large book and told we needed to donate before going in to pray, which was fine. However we were forced to donate 4 times altogether. Donâ€™t let this put you off visiting but be prepared."
"Located in interior of the city, this place has its own charm. It is open 24 hours and crowded as always. Won't say must visit when you are in Ajmer but I would say you should come Ajmer to visit Dargah."
YA great and lovely place of its kind. Felt inner peace and relax by just standing in there even after visiting for so many time. I just wana go again and again n againOne thing that touched my heart was that people of all religion was treated equally there.
Its spiritual place as everybody know very well. Go there with true heart.One thing i don't like that inside dargah many people stop u and ask for money saying we will do special prayer for you.
"Best time to visit morning 6-8 am, otherwise very crowded place. Don't carry valuables, take care of mobile, jewelry etc. Shoes not allowed inside and it is must to cover head. Better to engage some known khhadim outside and do haazri otherwise they will make fool of you by asking money at various points. It should be managed in a better way."
"This is not for regular tourists. Unless paying obeisance at the mausoleum the average tourist can give it a miss. If it happens to be a Thursday or the sixth of the month in the Islamic calendar you will be crushed in the melee of crowds. Even on ordinary days it is a scene of milling crowds all trying to pay respects at the shrine. Beware of pickpockets, vendors n pestering beggars."
"The roads to Dargarh are narrow and over crowded. Beware of pickpocketers. Also try avoiding carrying any baggage, even a shoulder bag as it is not allowed inside the dargah. However many Nearby shops provide baggage deposition facilities. Overall a good place to visit."
"The most famous Dargah Shariff in India but not at all well maintained. Undoubtedly a lot of tourists visit this place and because of that this place is very crowded but in order to keep the essence of this place alive the management should maintain the Quality at this place. Listened to the Qawali at this place and it was very good, dargah didnt even have space of a person to stand properly for couple of seconds."
