Tyumen is not really a city where you must stop while on your trans-sib journey but if you do stop go down to the embankment  and spend an afternoon there. It's probably the only thing that's really nice in this city apart from the nightlife (don't expect a good night life during school breaks). This walk at least gave us something to remember as the city itself was a disappointment. Seeing investments like this in Russian cities gives us hope that maybe once in the future these places will become worthy to come back to.
"I walked from my hotel (Vostok) to the South bank of the river by following to the right the Republic Avenue: sometimes dusty and noisy (traffic) walk for a bit more than 2 km, not very nice under the early June sunshine of Siberia. Meeting theTura and its green banks was a relief. I even crossed the modern bridge to thave a look on the other side. Fortunately, I could get a taxi to get back to the hotel."
"I've seen couple of embankments of Russian rivers and I wasn't that impressed with this one. The walkway is nice, there's an excellent free public toilet en route, very clean and very nice, but that's it. Embankment should be a public space, a place with benches and caf√©s and other places to rest. This is just a long walkway and nothing else. Feels a bit sad."
