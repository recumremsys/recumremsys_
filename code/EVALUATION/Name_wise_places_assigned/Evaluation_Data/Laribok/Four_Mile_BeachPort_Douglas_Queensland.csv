A beautiful beach - what more can you say? Just a beautiful stretch of sand with palm trees and one side and the Coral Sea on the other. Beware the crocs and the stingers. Walking it is a fantastic way to start and end every day you stay in Port Douglas
"The sand is compact, flat and smooth and makes for a perfect pushbike ride. Palm tree lined and beautiful. Hire a pushbike from the hire shop in Port Douglas and ride from one end of the beach to the other.  Return along the beach or cut through one of the many tracks and return via the bike paths."
The beach is beautiful to walk as well as the trail that goes the other direction.  Has a bunch of steps but is a nice path along the cliff area .
Walked lots on the 4 mile beach.lovely beach. Sea in the cordoned off area lovely and warm. Beach is great to walk on. Natural beach can beat some of beaches in Hawaii
Just beautiful and unspoiled coastline. There’s a patrolled section for swimming but we also enjoyed walking along the beach. Be careful for the stingers.
Great beach! Worth walking the whole distance and back. Recommend going at low tide as high tide doesn’t leave too much sand. I also ran on the beach and the sand is hard. The photo I took speaks for itself.
Spent a relaxing afternoon at four mile beach. The surrounding mountains is a beautiful backdrop. The waves are gentle & the water lovely. The palms & foliage provide excellent shade. Highly recommend.
"We've walked many beaches in our lifetimes but this one is among the very best.  Flat, lovely sand with friendly people met along the way.  Safe.  Wear a hat and use suntan lotion - it's easy to get a sunburn out there!"
"Great when wind not blowing. Hire a bike and ride across the hard packed sands. Lots of places to stay and lots of activities to do. Ride a bike, beach yoga or just sit and relax."
Loved walking the beach in the afternoon when the tide was right out. Beautiful beach and you can walk into town.
"Walked from our hotel to the Beach. This was a walk in heaven!  Sand and sea on one side  , and  rolling hills and tropical vegetation on the other!  Really gorgeous."
A pristine beach that seems to go on forever. There is a safe swimming area assisted by the life guards. Pay attention to the notices about stingers and crocs but don't let that stop you from having fun. The Aussies do want you to stay safe.
"There are so many beautiful beaches in Queensland. For sure this is one of them, mainly due to the rainforest flanking the curving sands, but is it actually one of the best? We put it to the test with both a visit to Trinity Bay Lookout and then an afternoon stroll along its actual 3.2 mile length. Didn't quite live up to the hype for us."
Lovely Long Beach to stroll along & take in the views. Clear waters ... no stingers at this time of year... warm water too! Recommended
"Loved being able to run on the beach. I’ve never seen a beach so flat and the sand compact. Bikers and Segways are even able to use the beach. Nice calm water and clean. Because of crocodiles and stingers in-season, they only recommend you swim at the patrolled portion on the far end near town. Plenty of parking there and even a beach hire for chairs, SUP’s, body boards, etc. Great place to spend the day."
We stayed at the Ramada Resort which has a track through to the beach which is great for walking and/or bike riding at low tide which you may catch at varying times. Walking north we were approx 3.5 kms from the town where you could relax have a coffee and then walk back or catch the Shuttle back to your hotel. The beach is not what you could call golden sands but being palm tree lined and with a view to the mountains and easy swimming. Kite Surfing Lessons are also available.
Not really for swimming- the very Long Beach has a small netted area up near the surf club ( although nets only out in stinger season ). Ever afternoon the winds pick up & it’s extremely choppy. Swimming in the morning the water was calmer - but visibility poor . Take a walk or ride a hire bike with the rest of the tourists!
Great beach to walk and relax on. Come at the right time of year the ocean is great to swim in. Unfortunately there is always some selfish people laying on the beach who play music thinking that everyone wants to listen to it. And also some selfish people kicking balls around...But it is truly a great place.
"Great beach walk.   Relaxing, great views.  Close to town and easy walk.  Access for wheelchairs too.  Beautiful, a must when visiting Port Douglas"
This is the only beach in town but runs right down one side and is quite pretty. Patrolled section is close to town. Gets quite busy but definitely worth doing while you are here.
"Was not much of a beach. Nice to walk along and dip toes in maybe, but have to duck and weave around trees"
"Loved doing the four mile beach walk. The day we did it the weather was lovely, clear blue sky. We took some superb photos & it is a great way if you are looking for something special & getting exercise at the same time. I would say if you are staying in Port Douglas this walk is a must, most enjoyable."
Was okay... Nice mountains and scenery. It’s not turquoise water or white sand or anything like that! Depends what you’re expecting - some of the photos are doctored for sure! I don’t know...  the warning signs of jellyfish and crocodiles make you a tad uneasy lol ... not my first choice of beach! Was Pretty to walk down and splash around in though. Water was pretty cold in August you couldn’t just jump on in!
"We drove from Palm Cove to Port Douglas for a day st at the beach. Was nice place except for the gusty winds. Very choppy waves as well so unable to stay with young children. We saw the potential. However, perhaps check wind report if possible in order not to make same mistake we did."
Patrolled beach with loungers and umbrellas available for hire. Calm water and wide beachfront means plenty of play time for the kids.
Took a number of walks at this beautiful and tranquil beach. Particularly early in the morning to see the sun rise. It was well worth getting up early for it.
We had a really nice walk on this beach. Did not finish 4 miles each way but got to turn.  Beautiful beach and views and a wonderful long walk with friends.
"Nice firm sand, warm water (in winter). Friendly people. Dog friendly. A great walk. Avoid the southern end of the beach where crocs are said to lurk."
Great looking beach.  Was unfortunately closed for swimming due to rough seas for the entire duration we were there in the first week of Apr 19
"Although you can’t swim at this beach due to jellyfish for most of the year, it is a classic tropical coastline great for the instagram photos. The sand is quite compact most of the time making for a great running beach. You’ll see many people walking or running and the entire place has a friendly vibe! Recommend a look if you’re in the area and an early morning run to beat the heat and humidity."
Beautiful long beach of corral sand. Used by swimmers in a stinger cage only at the northern end otherwise apart from the odd early morning runners you have it pretty much to yourself!
Great beach to swim or just lay on the sand.  Make sure you take the walkway around the point...a great way to experience the beauty of the place.
What a lovely beach spent a very enjoyable 90 mins walking 3.5miles on golden white sand. Views are amazing rain forest overlooking the beach making a fantastic back drop. Make it a must do while in Port Douglas
Staying in accomodation near the beach was fantastic. We were able to take leisurely walks every day along this beautiful beach. Looking forward to returning in a dry season.
"The beach is very clean and has an area for swimming which is patrolled by Life Guards. There are always quite a few people taking an early morning walk along the sand. Also recommended is getting up early to watch an absolutely amazing sunrise. Take your camera for that. At the north end of the beach - near Macrossan Street, there is also a pathway to a lookout which is also worth a visit."
