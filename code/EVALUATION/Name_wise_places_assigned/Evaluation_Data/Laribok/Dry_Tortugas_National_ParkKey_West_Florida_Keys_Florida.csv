"We took the American Freedom III ferry from Key West to Dry Tortugas - 2.5 hours each way. Boat is nice but if you get motion sick be prepared for popup storms. This is an amazing historic site - antebellum (1840s) fort that is HUGE! Great views from the top of the wall. The ferry crew give a great tour! Snorkeling is fun and there are lots of fish even in shallower waters. But if you can, swim to buoys, better coral out there. The water quality changes - our first day couldn’t see past our hands. Second day we could see 5-7 feet, third day 20+ all the way to bottom of coaling dock piers. Cross your fingers for clear water. We camped two nights, nice - especially Sunday night when much quieter without the party boaters. Recommend camping Sunday through Tuesday for less overnight population. Yes, rats are there - so definitely pack with solid cooler etc. Best advice is take an air mattress- ground in camping area is very compacted, like concrete. Otherwise a great location, beautiful sunrises and sunsets, a place to truly “unplug.”"
"Fort Jefferson was a bucket list trip to Key West.  Checked this one off the list.  Went by ferry for the day and was worth every penny.  Snorkeling, swimming in aqua blue water and exploring the fort is what you do for the day.  Amazing views is all we can say."
"Ferry was sold out so I spent the extra money for the 40 min seaplane to Dry Tortuga. Pilot, Kris, was awesome.It was worth it! Beautiful ride. Saw tons of sea turtles and sharks from the plane. Ride was very smooth. Snorkeling was beautiful by the old dock pilings, out by the buoy and along the moat wall. Saw lots of fish, including barracuda and pretty corals. Water was very clear. Didn't do a tour of the fort but we walked around and saw the beautiful views from the roof."
"We opted for the 4 hour float plane trip to Dry Tortugas.  The flights themselves were worth the price - flying low over clear shallow waters allowed us to see lots of sea life.  The pilot communicated through very good headphones.We had a little over two hours at Fort Jefferson and the key.  Because we were the first plane out, the whole place felt very quiet - the 10 from our plane and a few campers.  We toured the Fort on our own - saw nobody there for most of the time inside.  Went snorkeling off the south side - water was clear, saw some interesting sea life and, as before, we were the only ones there.Got back in time to have lunch.  We debated staying for the 8 hour trip - that would be a good trip also except there is no shade there and the day we went it was cloudless and very warm; also, once the boat arrives there are a couple hundred more people around.  Not crowded but not as peaceful."
"We booked the park ferry months in advance to go to this quiet National park.  It was a full day, but fun.  The seas were a little choppy and we were told that the snorkeling there would not be great.  We brought gear, but decided not to go swimming after others said there was not much to see.  We listened to the guides short lecture on the Fort and then walked around exploring it ourselves.  Had lunch on the boat and then spent more time walking and just sitting on the beach watching others and enjoying the sun and beautiful views. The excursion was a bit pricey but the staff on the boat were great.  The return trip was a little more than bumpy, but we had no issues with seas sickness or otherwise.  One more National park off our bucket list!"
"We took the ferry from Key West on March 2 to Dry Tortugas.  There were some waves, but not bad.  Had breakfast on the boat.  On the Key, we had a short lecture and time to explore around the island, with an  option for a longer 45 minute guided tour..  It is amazing the buildings and the number of people that used to be housed there at one time.  There was an option to go snorkeling, but the surf had riled up the water and they said there would be little visibility, so we did not swim. The ride back to Key West was much rockier and people were told to remain in their seats.  If you get a chance - go to this jewel in the park system."
"Dry Tortugas NP has been on my bucket list for a while. We booked a 2:00 departure via Sea Plane Adventure. As we arrived the ferry was leaving so we enjoyed the island and snorkeling with absolutely no crowds.  Unfortunately, we did not get a tour of Fort Jefferson and the small gift shop on the inside was not open. We were traveling with 2 teens who wanted to snorkel anyway so it was not a big issue for us. Be sure to remember your ""reef safe"" sunscreen. Most snorkel areas are between 4-7 feet deep. The best area for sea life and coral is along the western moat wall. Compost/pit toilets are located near the campground. While the ferry is at dock they close those bathrooms and the ferry bathrooms are used.  There is a changing room (with two stalls) but no mirrors or sinks."
"Horrible Experience!!! I was on the ferry this past Friday, 8/28. We were about 30 mins away from Dry Tortugas when the captain came over the intercom to advise that there was a problem with the ferry and that we had to go back to Key West. This problem resulted in about half a day of lost time of vacation because we didn't make it back to the harbor until about 12:30 (boat leaves dock at 8). On the way back to Key West, a crewmember came around asking the passengers if we wanted refunds or to reschedule. He was conveniently unable to answer when our refunds would be processed, therefore, I decided to call the next day. Left 2 messages at 2 different times. No response. Called again this morning. No response. On top of that, the crew took the opportunity to excitedly announce on the way back that ""The bar is open early!"". You would think that after inconveniencing an entire boatload of people, they might comp at least one drink. Nope. Pay up! This tour company is a joke and I would advise anyone to avoid using them. I'm wondering if I will ever see my refund"
"This was the last National Park I was missing in FL and finally went to visit it. The trip has to be scheduled way in advanced because there is only one boat ride a day and fills up. It is a long trip to the key where the fort is located. If sea is choppy, please get Dramamine ahead of time. And have some for the ride back. The check in process and boarding went smoothly. Not much to see along the way. Light Breakfast and lunch were included and were fine. Once in the island, they gave us a tour of the fort. Take the long tour, it was worth it. They will tell you the history of the fort and answer questions.  David is a good story teller. The hiking was limited because birds are nesting nearby."
"Took the ferry over to Dry Tortugas.  The entire day was great!  The folks on the Yankee Freedom III ferry were professional and accomodating.  The ride over was a bit choppy, but the crew sold dramamine.  Make sure you pick some up; I watched a lot of big macho dudes lose their breakfasts.The fort itself is huge and interesting.  We enjoyed walking about and reading information.  There is a tour but we opted out.  The woman working in the bookstore was really fun to talk with, and told us a bit about what it was like living and working on the fort.The beaches were beautiful and the water sublime.  I've never seen so many conch shells in my life!Make the time do do this when you visit Key West.  You won't regret it!"
"Just came back from Key West on Sunday June 28th. On the first day of our trip 6-23-20 we took a sea plane out to the Dry Tortugas. The staff was great and helpful and our pilot John was awesome. We went snorkeling out by the pylons and the beach side, the water temp was perfect the scenary was amazing. LOVED IT!!! We had an amazing time."
The ferry crew and the tour guide were very knowledgeable about the park  The swimming and beaches were beautiful. Bring swim socks as the beach is crushed shells and not really sand
"Visited via Yankee White Catamaran and their service is excellent, they care.You definitely want to experience Fort Jefferson.  It is breath taking beautiful there.   During the first 30 minutes when the scenery was all new, I felt like I was seeing the most beautiful place in America.The snorkeling is fun.  There a reefs, plant life, and colorful fish.  It was awesome.  Wear a lot of sun block.  I had so much fun snorkeling, that I stayed out for a long time and got a mean sun burn.Watch out for moon jelly fish too!  They like to come say hi while you snorkel.The fort is fun to explore and the views from the top are amazing.There are lots of crabs hiding in shells all over the island too."
"‘Ello chaps!  Yankee Freedom is the exclusive water transportation option to get to get to Fort Jefferson (island) in the heart of the Dry Tortugas National Park.   Located approximately 70 miles west of Key West, it takes roughly 2 hours 30 minutes to get from Key West to the island, where you’ll have several hours to explore the fort and dip into the near by clear blue waters for some snorkeling and other aqua fun.   It is approximately $180 per person for the ferry day trip.   The cost includes round trip ferry transportation, a light breakfast and lunch, NPS fort entry fee, and use of snorkel gear.   The light breakfast consists of one-half bagel with cream cheese and a fruit, as well as choice of water, orange juice, or milk.   Lunch is choice of ham sandwich, turkey sandwich, as well as several cookies, chips, and water, canned lemonade,  or canned tea.   You have to prepare for an EARLY alarm on the day of the day of departure.   Campers have to report to the port by 6 a.m. with gear in hand - and day trippers are urged to be there by 7 a.m. for boarding to begin around 715/730 a.m.   The boat leaves around 8 a.m. for the hair more than 2 hour ferry ride out to the island. Day trippers arrive around 10:30 a.m. with the option to head right to the water, explore Fort Jefferson on your own, or take the guided tour of Fort Jefferson. All options leave plenty of time to snorkel and enjoy the the waters.   On board the ferry you can grab sandwich lunch 11a.m. - 1 p.m.   Upon arrival there is a small two person changing house and a fresh water rinse station on the back of the boat.   The crew is very friendly and welcoming, and the “cruise director” is very informative with a history of the island, route, and things to see.   The ferry also offers a variety of merchandise and food items for purchase. It’s not five star cuisine, in quality nor pricing, that’s a good thing. Chips, drinks, etc are just a few dollars. Alcohol beverages are also available for purchase on the return trip.   For many, this trip is a bucket list trip.   It truly is a memorable experience.   Overall I give Yankee Freedom and the trip to Fort Jefferson five stars out of five."
"Best Kept National Park Secret.  We were there with about 100 people in a National Park.  The history was fantastic with beautiful scenery and sights.  We enjoyed the tour, gift shop and snorkeled.  Take the day trip and enjoy one of our most beautiful National Parks.  We will go back again.  The ride was relaxing and fun and the staff and crew were amazing.  If you have never been, GO!!!"
The staff on the Ferry were the best. Smooth trip for a great day at the park. Enjoyed the water and snorkeling.
Must make reservations well in advance or check at kiosk by port for cancellations.  Our guide was great and very enthusiastic.  Two and half hour ride to island was beautiful and they gave information the whole trip.  The fort is amazing and we wandered the entire island.  Wanted to snorkel but the water was a bit cold.  Highly recommend this for a day trip from Key West.
"I was afraid my second visit to Dry Tortugas was not going to be as good as the first because you know what the saying is about second parts. But this time it was even better. Starting with the reservation process. I had to call because one member of our party could not make it. Yvonne at the Yankee Freedom was super helpful. The entire crew in the ferry did the best to make our experience unique despite the whole COVID situation. We had a great day at Fort Jefferson. My recommendation is to bring mosquito repellent, those bugs are hungry. Also bring an umbrella and go to the North Beach, it is better than the South Beach in my opinion. Do not miss the snorkeling even if you cannot swim, it is really shallow. We saw two huge tarpons and many yellow tails. We could have touched them because they were totally un afraid and very curious. We are looking forward to go next year."
The boat ride to the Dry Tortugas was fabulous and you would have never guessed that they were short handed.  Getting off the boat you are immediately infatuated with the crystal clear water.  The fort was fantastic as well.
"It’s two hours on a boat, but well worth the voyage.  The huge fort is fascinating.  Be sure todo for on a day that the guide named Hollywood."
"This was a great day all around.  Booking online was very easy.  I arrived early for check in and they really made us wait until 7am.  The check in was easy.  While waiting to board they walked us through what to expect and sold us a single dose of Dramamine.  If you have any doubts buy it.  There were several instances of people getting sick, and the drug would have saved them embarressment and feeling sick for the rest of the day.  They provided a cold breakfast.  They showed info videos that helped me to be set for the snorkeling later.  Once on shore I opted for the guided tour of the fort and learned things I would have missed, due to my lack of patience with reading every plackard.  After eating my lunch of sandwiches provided for us, I went on my snorkeling adventure.  I came back in with time to get showered and change for the return trip.  Several things to know and plan for.  You will take all your items with you off the ship, so bring a pack you can carry.  The WiFi did not work, so if you want to buy something bring cash.  While they provide scuba equipment you need to bring the towel.  It may be warm in Key West, but it won't be on the ship especially after going for a swim.I loved this trip.  I was able to relax due to no WiFi accessibility.  Did something I had never done before, snorkeling.  A perfect day."
"Went to the fort with the ferry. Just as I was amazed by the Grand Canyon, after finally seeing it, I was amazed by this location and the history behind it. The snorkeling was amazing, it was interesting to know one could camp on-site, and the fort itself is awe-inspiring. Very much recommend this as an agenda item on any Key West trip."
"20 to 30 mph winds and mid to high 60s forecast for the day of our reservation.  Called at 7am to ask about conditions and recommendations since they are the experts and got a very rude response.  To my question about conditions I got “either you go or you don’t, we are still going”.  With that response I knew I just lost 360 dollars so I cancelled.  He said “ok I’ll cancel your reservation”.  I thought maybe there would be a Hail Mary chance for a refund but all I received was a blunt “no”.  I feel I made the right decision after seeing 12ft seas.  That would cripple my wife for two days at least due to motion sickness.  This was one of her bucket list items for our trip to Key West.  She can handle choppy seas but nothing like what we saw in the forecast the morning of departure.  We plan on making another attempt in the future but via seaplane.  We will not book the ferry due to the lack of customer service.  Our lesson, read the reviews carefully and take note of the bad ones.  Heed the cancellation policy and don’t expect any consideration from the vendor due to weather or conditions.  Also don’t cause yourself anguish by thinking you can make the boat trip.  Sea sickness is no joke.  Be sure you can handle rough conditions.  Cancel early if you have any doubts."
"We enjoyed our 2 hour visit here.  Touring the fort, walking on the moat wall, seeing the fish, watching the Frigate birds, strolling the beach, and sitting in the sun took up all our time.  We did NOT snorkel as the 75 degree water was too cold for me!  Currently you can get here by ferry or seaplane from Key West.  There are loads of fish in the waters and under the dock that you can see from dry land. It was a nice visit on a wonderful sunny day for us."
LOVED this Experience!  We took the Seaplane and we felt it was well worth it.  Such a beautiful ride to Dry Tortuga.  Snorkeling was great- and the water was perfect!
"Loved this trip! Staff on the Yankee Freedom III were very nice and took great care of us. We had our National Park Annual Pass and the staff applied the refund exactly as stated on their website. Breakfast was a snack - so if you need more bring it or buy it. The food and drinks they sold were very reasonable - not marked up which was awesome. Lunch was a sandwich made with love, chips, cookies and a cold drink. We snorkeled for hours and toured the fort. Kids got their National Park stamp and the gift store was open - which was not the case at Everglades or Key Biscayne. Dry Tortugas is a must see!! We have great memories, beautiful pictures, and enjoyed every bit of this tour. Thank you Yankee Freedom III and the lady working at the National Park Store!"
This is a great day excursion. Go see the fort and snorkel around. Easy boat ride and the park rangers are great. Everything felt safe and was hassle-free.
The trip to Dry Tortugas by catamaran was the worst. People eating breakfast and then vomiting all over the place. Never again! Lets be honest folks that this is very false rating of this excursion.
"A visit to the Dry Tortugas National Park has been on our bucket list for some time.  Finally made it!  Having researched the history of  Fort Jefferson, we were looking forward to exploring the fort.  Almost the entire fort is open for exploration and it proved to be a pretty spectacular experience walking the different levels and imagining what it was like in the mid 1800s. If this is all you want from your visit, I don’t think there’s a reason to ever visit again.  However, there are opportunities for camping, snorkeling, and kayaking that we did not take advantage of.  We visited in January and the water temp was pretty cool and due to recent storms the water clarity was not good.  We took the ferry here (2 1/2 hrs), but there are also float planes trips to the park."
We had a great time at Dry Tortugas National Park.  The weather was perfect.  Loved the blue ocean.  Would love to try camping out there sometime!
"I had no expectation and everyone in crew loved this. Touring the fort, beautiful water, snorkeling was fun. We took the ferry. A few got sea sick....we brought snacks but the ferry has snacks. Breakfast is a half bagel w/cream cheese. Lunch was a choice of turkey or ham sandwich made by the crew. Bring your own water there is no water and the water on the ferry are tiny bottles. Parking, we parked where the ferry said to park $32 a day but there is a parking garage right across the street from checkin for $15 a day. Overall, worth the trip!  Makes for a long day but very worth it."
Took float plane to Dry Tortugas and snorkeled there.   Great experience!!!!  What a great fort—-made up of 16 million bricks.
"We went on 2/23/20.  Winds were 20+ mph and wave heights were 4+ ft.  We are boaters and knew what to expect. While it was a choppy ride, we were fine.  Others, not so much.  Take the dramamine.  Once at Fort Jefferson, you can listen to a short talk, then take the longer tour.   Your choice.  Snorkeling was offered, but water was churned up and cold.  We passed.  You can walk all around,  on the sea wall, and atop the fort.  Great views and lots of history.  Breakfast and lunch were good.  Staff was busy with sick people, but always had a smile."
"We thoroughly enjoyed the ride out and the history of the fort. It is absolutely stunning and it’s amazing to think of the challenges faced when building a fort of that size in the middle of the Gulf. Unfortunately, with the rain on the way out and while we were there it was too murky too see much while snorkeling, but the views from the top of Fort Jefferson were breath taking. As for the crew on the Yankee Freedom III, Bryan, Tom, and Kelly were wonderful and kept everyone comfortable. While we weren’t sick, we watched as they retrieved waters and cold compresses for those that weren’t fairing as well. They made accommodations for my GF diet needs and offered to store the couple’s insulin that we shared a table with. There are not enough positive things to say about Hollywood. His enthusiasm is infectious and we appreciated having such an energetic and knowledgeable guide. Two downfalls: 1) many parts of the fort are closed for restoration so we’d like to return when it’s more open and 2) we were told to be there at 7am to checkin and board. At 8am, they were still admitting people to the ferry that were “late” after we were supposed to leave at 745am. Be prepared to spend about 5 hours total on the ferry. It was about 4 hours at Fort Jefferson and playing in the water."
"What a great way to spend the day in Key West.  ""Hollywood"" was a very informative tour guide and made history come alive.  The boat ride on the ""Freedom Express"" was smooth and comfortable.  Plenty of time to explore the island and go swimming.  Can't say I was thrilled with the food (due to COVID it was paired down) but I got enough to eat.  Make sure you follow their directions of the things to bring.  You will need them."
