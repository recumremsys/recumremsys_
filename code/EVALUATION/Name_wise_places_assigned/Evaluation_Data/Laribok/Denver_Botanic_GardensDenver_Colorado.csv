"I love learning about plants that grow nicely in the weather and altitude of Denver.  This is the place to do it!  Relaxing for an afternoon stroll.  Good for kids, but possibly a little boring for teens.  Since I live in Denver, I visit often so I can see the impact of the seasons."
"Located in the middle of Denver, the garden is a true oasis. Quiet, lots to see, tropical garden of amazement. Unique art work scattered through out.  After walking for an hour and half found great cafe,next to pond. We were able to relax and regain our energy to continue on,still only saw about half in 4 hours. Great day or 1/2 day for all."
"The Denver Botanic Gardens is a beautiful gem in the middle of Denver.  In the winter the place is lit up for the holidays.  You can pay a little more and get glasses that change the look of the lights.  Great for kids too!  In the summer, you can take a stroll after dinner and walk off dessert.  The concert series sells out quickly as well as various other offerings throughout the year.  I've enjoyed the gardens dozens of times and highly recommend them.  Don't miss the Chihuly sculpture!"
Whenever I go to the Denver Botanic Gardens I feel so relaxed and appreciate the stroll thru the garden. Make sure to take sun screen and wear good walking shoes. You dont want to burn out before you finish your time here. I also love a break at the outside restaurant. The food is above average and you will deserve the rest of sitting and still appreciate your surroundings. Its a great place to visit.
"Awesome peacefully place. Parking on site. If you need to enjoy a beautiful place right in the middle of the city, this it’s the place. Instantly favorite to me. A must tried."
Spending a few hours in the York St. gardens makes you forget you're in a city.  Open year round but particularly beautiful summer through early fall when everything is in bloom. Art and periodic exhibits add to the beauty and tranquility.  They also have concerts and classes.
"This is a ""must see"" while visiting Denver.  The beautiful array of flowers, winding trails, English and Japanese gardens, along with the most amazing lily pond, capture nature at its best.  Nourish your soul with the peace and tranquility of this botanical garden.  You will love it!"
A true gem in the heart of Denver. It’s a wonderful oasis and is wonderfully maintained. There are so many different garden “areas” I’m sure we missed some even though we were there for a little over 2 hours. I would love to go back at different times of the year to see the changes that I’m sure occur during the changing of seasons. Give yourself enough time when you visit so you don’t feel rushed – this space is much bigger than you think.
"Denver is actually dry. The tropical plants are in a done to keep humid. The gardens are nice. Lots of interesting statues. There's a ceremonial teahouse, wasn't open. Bonsai plants were on display. Lots of succulents. ( Side note. We were going to go to zoo, but it was free day. Check before you go. Avoid free day. All of Denver was there."
"Go, go, go! A serene retreat in the middle of the city. We were lucky enough to visit on Rosh Hashanah with a large private service set up under a tent. We enjoyed the music and singing and feeling of reverence that enhanced the gardens. Very friendly staff and volunteers. We got there easily from downtown via a #10 bus. Another plus."
See nature and relax for awhile.  This is a great getaway in the heart of Denver and a great way to spend a few hours.
Enjoyed this so much. Beautiful gardens everywhere combined with art. Definitely worth seeing especially if you like nature. One of the most beautiful botanical garden I have ever been.
"This has the be the best thing to do in Denver. There were many types of gardens. Japanese gardens and desert gardens were highlights. Instagrammers’ paradise. My teen daughters took tons of photos. Normally, they do not bother, but there was so much beauty all around, you simply had to capture it. I enjoyed the many sculptures and gazebos and doorways throughout. Beautiful gift shop too. Take a Lyft there as its not really walking distance from the other Denver attractions."
"Came here on a work “field trip” and I loved it.   It a great place to sit and/or wander and enjoy being outside and enjoying nature.     They have different areas including a huge greenhouse, Japanese inspired gardens and water gardens.   Each exhibition is unique and breathtaking.  The pictures do not do the beauty of the gardens justice.  Grab a map or just wander aimlessly either way you will love the gardens.   You can have lunch there at the Hive bistro and the food actually tastes very good.  An adult ticket is $12.50 and you can stay the entire day.  Parking is free."
Visited this place with my mom... If you like walking in a peaceful and nice place then you definetly have to go there... took some super stunning pictures also
"Loved this place I felt like in the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. Having a picnic while enjoying flowers and butterflies with my children felt very refreshing, and of course learning interesting fact about plants was a plus."
"Walking thru the gardens is not just about plants--there are sculptures, seating areas to reflect and much more. Gaze at the fish and stand under a tall tree--all nice escapes for the day ."
"I've been to a lot of gardens around the country and I was impressed with the Denver Botanic Gardens. The place is not huge, but they really do make great use of the space. Due to the pandemic the indoor exhibits are closed, but you will find a lot to see outside. Make sure you go on their website to reserve a time."
What a truly amazing site right in the middle of Denver.  Such beauty and color all around.  Don't miss these gardens if you are ever in Denver.
"During my visit here this summer, I enjoyed the gardens tremendously. One thing I found nice is seeing weddings in progress along with a bridal shower.  Being able to see those events while enjoying the gardens was a plus for me.  Can’t wait to return."
"These gardens are very nice. Many different garden areas and enclosed / hot houses. Take your time to stroll through them all. I really liked the tropical conservatory, (the large glass dome-like structure), it contains so many lovely topical and sub-tropical varieties. Don't forget to check-out the Japanese Gardens."
"This was our favorite place on our 3 day trip.  We could have stayed there forever!  Quiet, serene and just awesome.  Make sure to go to the Japanese Gardens."
"Denver Botanic Garden is so well presented, has a really vast collection of plants/trees & accompanying insects/wildlife. Among them: butterflies, dragonflies, bees, a squirrel in the Birds & Bees section, plenty of koi fish in the Japanese garden and tiny frogs on lily pads. It provides decent shade throughout but I recommend bringing a big bottle of water & to dress sun-smart. Coming first thing in the morning was great because there was less foot traffic and heat. For a $12.50 USD entry fee, I would go again to take more photographs. The more you look throughout the garden, the more you will fall in love with nature. The only downside of my visit came when I was told by a Colorado local that the Denver Botanic Gardens & Cheesman Park were built on land that was a cemetery in the 1800’s. Would have reconsidered my visit had I known."
What a beautiful and relaxing garden in walking distance from our hotel (in cherry creek). Very clean and well taken care of with outstanding and caring people who work there. Thank you for such a nice visit!
Went on a whim and damn happy we did. The flowers and walk paths were the perfect break from walking around the downtown area.
"We really enjoyed our visit to the botanic gardens. We were staying near the downtown Convention Center and didn't have a car, but it was easy getting to the gardens via the #10 bus.Once there, we loved wandering through the grounds, taking in the beautiful flowers and plants. We especially liked the Japanese garden and the Monet pool (such beautiful water lillies!). The grounds are very well maintained.There are many places to just sit and admire the beauty if you want to take a break from walking. Don't forget to bring your camera -- there will be plenty of great opportunities to capture nature's beauty."
The caretakers of the Gardens have done a fantastic job of creating a place where you can truly get lost.  Both physically and in seeing all the different plants.  There are numerous winding paths and water features.  Be prepared to spend some time.
"Lots of areas inside and out. Enjoyed coffee in the cafe, and explored the many gardens surrounding the building. Gift shop was interesting, and parking was close/reasonable."
"Not usually my thing to visit plants, but this was a nice stop. Beautiful grounds with plenty of variety to look at. Took some great pictures too."
"The footprint of this botanic garden is smaller than others I have visited but they do a lot with a small space.  I enjoyed the farm to table & secret gardens the most.  Spend half a day when you go, it's worth it."
We went in the spring. Enjoyed the beautiful view. Great place for kids to roam. Lots of natural beauty and exercise
"Pick a nice warm sunny fall day to visit. It is delightful, educational and refreshing place to be. We took around 3 hours to walk, rest, snack and admire the beauty of this garden. I highly recommend.Moe T"
"The gardens are a great place to relax and reflect as you walk around the paths. There are several different outdoor themed areas, beautiful water features and various plants from several regions. The grounds was decorated for Fall with many warm oranges, browns and various gourds and pumpkins. Do check the weather before you go. We visited after an unusual cold snap and many of the plants were wilted. As this is a part of nature we were not surprised but a little disappointed."
Beautiful. People were friendly and able to answer any questions I had. Found some lovely gifts. Easy to walk through. There is construction around the area.
"Spent the morning wandering around the beautiful gardens in a very peaceful setting.  There are a variety of garden types, from Japanese to rose gardens, with many benches to sit and take in the beauty.  The Monet garden is especially lovely with a pond, lily pads and colorful flowers.  Each of the gardens were well maintained and lush.  Highly recommend."
