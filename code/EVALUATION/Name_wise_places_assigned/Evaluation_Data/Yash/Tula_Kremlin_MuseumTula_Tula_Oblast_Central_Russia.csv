The Kremlin at Tula is beautifully preserved and the exterior walls and towers are impressive. Inside is a stunning Orthodox Cathedral (sadly not open) and a fascinating museum that tells the history of Tula's armaments industry from medieval swords up to Cold War era rocket launchers. I am not especially interested in weapons but the display is fascinating and there are a few reconstructions of old interiors that put it all in perspective. The ceiling frescoes are fascinating relics from the Soviet era. Taking photos INSIDE the Armoury museum is prohibited.
"Dear Travellers! I would highly recommend to visit Kremlin and especially because the visitor can have a rest from the busy noisy streets of the town of Tula and breath fresh air inside the Kremlin walls. And also there is an ancient museum of ""swords and helmets"" which is located inside the wall of the Kremlin. One can even try on the dress of a medieval warrior and mistress and have a sword, broadsword and glaive in the hand, a helmet on the head and make a photo with it standing on a Kremlin's wall. Great to see and visit the churches which are right inside this great architectural monument and of course they are themselves. Give a chance for this city to stay in your hearts with great moments"
What a wonderful place to visit! Calm and a huge park. It's amazing to be aware of that Kremlin is in several cities and not just Moscow. Tula has a very interesting history and is an old city. Visit it!
"In Russia a kremlin is what we know as a fort in america. We went in the afternoon, on a day that happened to be the day of the Gingerbread festival. The Tula Kremlin was bustling with activity: gingerbread displays, sales booths, ovens, dancers, a band was playing and there were old school kids rides. The traditional Russian entertainment was great. The Armament Museum inside the Tula Kremlin was pretty cool as well. Museum's are okay but, an inter active group of displays really unlocks one's understanding and can make or break an experience. Now this is a weapons museum with amazing paintings, displays and pretty cool architecture, along with having a lot of guns, rifles, knives, swords, and suits of armor on display. Quoting what a US Navy Special Forces guy once told me: ""to oversimplify the effectiveness and accuracy of gun or rifle-- accuracy is the ability to hurl the object coming out the end, down the rang in exactly the same way every time, regardless of what action happens in the weapon to make the exact same repetitive trajectory."" Having heard that I began looking at weapons in a different light, to simply look at them behind glass was okay, but I wanted more. On our way out an old woman stopped us and began fumbling for keys to a locked room. At First I thought she was mad, she was speaking excitedly to us in Russian, she was not mad. Behind the door was a room with the all too familiar smell of old military items, I was afraid to enter because of how the display was set up, this was one of those rooms you could look at but not enter, since the artifacts were lying about the place arranged in an outdoor scene. To my surprise, she motioned us in. At first I resisted the urge to touch anything, she started handing me weapons, it was so cool! Then she began dressing our friend and I in old Russian uniform coats and hats, taking photos of us with weapons. This made the museum experience for me. She took photos of us in uniforms and with weapons posed behind sandbags and tables, as officers, troops and as enemy troops. What a cool experience, and what a way to end the visit to a museum. This absolutely made my day.The church in the kremlin was a masterpiece both inside and out. The exterior had the towers and gold dome. The interior had grand ceilings with incredible paintings everywhere. It was absolutely breathtaking, unfortunately this wasn't interactive and photos weren't allowed. I enjoyed the Armament Museum much more.It was off to the tower and kremlin wall, we had to pay a little money. Again somewhat interactive, I enjoyed this. There were rooms with displays, and outer corridors to shoot at the enemies over the many decades of invaders of the past, from the Mongolians to the Natzies. Because of Tula's weapons factories, it has been a major target for the enemies of the past. As I checked this out I envisioned the days when bow and arrow and spheres were used for defence, to the time powder rifles were used. What an experience, knowing the history of the City of Tula. Tula itself is a city known for making weapons, gingerbread, and tea pots. I can't wait to visit again."
12th century fort of Czar's Russia.  Has several museums including Samovars and arms. Has a market where soveniers can be purchased.  Nice place to take family photos with ancient touch.
