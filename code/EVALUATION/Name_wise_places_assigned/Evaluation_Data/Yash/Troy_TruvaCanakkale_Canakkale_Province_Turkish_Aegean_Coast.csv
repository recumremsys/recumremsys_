"Most people think there isn't much to see in Troy but if you get the feel of the place and the various levels of troy it really is special. Read up the legend of Paris and Helen, stand by the stone roadway where hector rode down to meet Achillis. Look out at the land that was once water and imagine those 1,000 ships. The Iliad talks of this windy place with such poetry that when you stand at Troy you are with Homer and his words. Loved, loved the place."
Great to be able to see the site. The history is amazing and gives a little realism to the myths we read/see. Amazing how many layers of history with so many generations building on top of the last. Saw the replica horse at the site and then the wooden horse that was used in the movie is in cannukle town.
"Nice historical place to visit, but it is so much more attractive because of the famous story behind the site. We were there end of season so we had the whole site almost to our self. Combine this trip with a trip to the Canakkale Martyrs Monument and Anzac /Gallipoli"
"The recreated wooden horse is not very impressive but a walk through the site is amazing. Do make sure somebody explains the site to you, or read about it in advance. The multi-layered city was very important in history even though Helen of Troy may have been a myth."
Homer's Troy... You will need a good guide who can tell the story as you go around the archeological site. Need to visualize how the city was built and reimagine how it was during the reign of Priam.
"Probably not many people have never heard anything about the Troy war… Even if the ancient Greek history was not your favorite topic at literature classes at school, most likely you have seen the movie with Brad Pitt. Anyway – if you’ll decide the visit Troy archeological site, make sure to do your homework and read a lot about its discovery and excavations. Otherwise you might be disappointed if you would be looking for remains of actual city of Troy. Note that it has been damaged seriously quite a few times, so there are not that many things to see there. Therefore you will really have to use your imagination! But once you’ll do that you can feel the breeze of ancient times!"
"Not the most impressive ruins in the ""cradle of civilization"" but a must see as the old ruins date back to at least 3000 years BCE and probably more. We visited this 9 level archaeological site with the 7 day classic tour of turkey with Viator ( also recommended). Compare the replica Trojan horse on site to the one in town donated by the 2004 American movie ""Troy""."
"Not really a great lot at the place, but just exciting to BE there at the site of ancient Troy. To get the most out of it, probably best to take a tour (I didn't). Walked the entire site in one hour."
Makes you remember that people lived before you on your lands. 2-3 hours will be enough to see everything. Shop is terrible...
Loved visiting Troy.  Well worth the trip.  We were told that there wasn't much there but I thought it was great.  I've been to many other ruins around the world and it was up with the best of them.  Happy to recommend it.  Amazing to think there is so much more of it for them to discover as apparently only around 10% has been excavated.  Might need to go back in a few years time.
Obviously the wooden horse is not original but it is very well done.   Incredible to be walking along historical paths and grounds.   Added bonus were the very friendly cats.   We went 2 years ago and would probably go again.   So much to see and hear about.    There was nothing we did not like.   Definitely bring a camera or at least a mobile phone and sensible walking shoes.
"From childhood you read and hear about Troy. You see it in movies but trust me when you are finally there, the experience truly is remarkable.  You are literally walking in the same places that you read about.  The fact that so much of it still remains after all these thousands of years just makes the place that much more awe inspiring.  The walls, the layers showing how the different Troys were built on top of one another, the remains of the streets everything combines to truly give you the feeling of being in another time and place.  Yes the horse is ""touristy as hell"" but you know what, we loved it all the same.  You can walk up and take some pictures and it adds some fun to the place as well.  Take time to separate from your group once in a while and really take in the surroundings.  Its worth it."
Visiting Troy is like a fairly tale come true.  We enjoyed the walk through the ruins and the scenary is beautiful.  We climbed the Trojan Horse and enjoyed the peaceful moments inside.  Very nice experience.
Excellent attraction. Lots of history and information. Suggest that you get a guide to show you around to get the best out the visit
Included as part of our Gate 1 tour. Our guide made the walk through the rocky ruins interesting otherwise it looks like a bunch of rocks. You NEED a guide. Reading the information boards (which has good info) gets tedious after a while. Also if possible go early to avoid the school kids that really take away from the experience. Note it will probably be very windy.
"Visiting Troy seems to be the thing to do when in this part of the world.  We were disappointed with the guide who had been doing this too long and seemed bored and hustled us through.  The complexity of the multiple cities is hard to digest on passing through quickly ,  and the site is still confusing.  A new museum has just open but was not included on the tour because of time allocated.  A quick visit of 5 minutes indicated it might have helped educate the visitors if adequate pre visit time was allowed as it contains many of the best artifacts"
You should visit this ancient place with a professional guide. Feeling the life belonging to 3000 years ago is fascinating.
"The ruins of Troy are just that, ruins. Don’t expect re-enacted or replica city. Plenty of information boards in both languages mean you don’t need a guide. We went when it opened and there were already 5 tour buses there as well. Plenty to explore at your own pace."
Has always been on the top of my list. Was pretty cool finly seeing the place with my own eyes. I went with a tour group. Although it wasent all I thought it would be. I recommend a few hours to have a good look around.
"OK, we climbed the horse too. It is a bit of fun and keeps your place in your photos! The archaeological site itself is much larger, shows 6 distinct layers of history/settlement (so far) and has excellent signs and interpretative assists. You can look out from the higher parts to the waterways where the boats came in. Walking through the ancient walls and looking a the construction detail and carving gives you a new view of the old legends. Walkways are easy to navigate."
"Three nights in this hotel.  Travelling with a small group of people on a history tour.  Well located on sea front, easy walking distance to ferry, bazaar, post office, market.  Nice bedroom, comfortable bed, very adequate bathroom / toilet. Toiletries provided - big tick !  Tea/coffee making facilities in room - big tick.  Vast variety of different foods available for every meal.  Clean, tidy, well maintained. Reception staff had limited Englsh, which surprised me. ( Yes, I know. I should have learnt Turkish before I travelled).  Reception staff ( all male) often seemed less than interested in assisting, - language barrier was obviously part of the problem, but I suspect that better  training is needed.  Wifi was unreliable, and had limited strength - couldn’t download messages. Lifts worked well.Quiet except for yowling, fighting dogs at night. Not the Hotels’s fault. It is “ the culture” we are told, to accommodate and feed stray dogs and cats. The city is lousy with big stray dogs and skinny stray cats."
"The museum opened in late 2018 and is frankly amazing. You move up 7 levels corresponding to the ages of history of Troy and surrounding sites, seeing the artifacts and learning about the history.  The archaeological process is also brought out. Allow a good 2 hours with teenagers. As with most museums in Turkey, you can't understand why it isn't full of school groups.It is entirely separate to the Troy ruins which are tired and unimpressive, but obviously very significant and must visit.  The museum opens up the ruins and provides a rich understanding of the layered history of the area and empires."
Decided to go there after watching the movie. Learned a lot of history. Take the tour to make sense of the ruins.
Thoroughly enjoyed visiting this ruin site with ongoing excavations.  Learning the history of the site and area was incredibly interesting.  The city walls show the difference between constructions of different eras.  The nine layers of ancient cities are labeled at the excavations .
Have seen many of the sites of Rome and rate this higher.  An excellent job being done by Archeologists has brought to light amazing displays of many different Troy settlements going back 1000's of years.  A must see in Turkey
"Compared to other archaeological sites in Turkey it rates only average. That said, its interesting seeing how cities upon cities were built over 1000 years with different styles.The wooden horse didn't excite, however for kids or those who have seen the movie, its good to recount the story.Wouldn't drive past, but wouldn't travel long distance to visit."
Saw the Troy ruins. The drive to up here was awesome. It was just like the movie. We saw the Aegean Sea on the way. The Horse's tail had been damaged and we could not go up. Overall if you like history its worth a visit.
Troy is uninteresting piece of ancient history. The ruins were very impressive and the stories of ancient Troy very interesting. Defiantly worth a visit. Didn't see Brad there though.
"Looking at the remains of the ancient city of Troy there are many parts of the city that have been restored and still under excavation. You will need a tour guide which explained the fascinating history of Troy and various layers of the ancient of city being build on top of the many times destroyed city plus why the city walls were build this way in order to prevent the attackers conquering the city! You can easily spent a couple of hours provided there is an experienced tour guide with you, if not you will be walking aimlessly as there is NO sign boards explaining the structures you are looking at."
"It is truly an amazing experience to be in such a historical location, definitely worth the trip!! The new museum is very good, both beautiful and very educational, no problem at all going here on your own. The ruins themselves are in quite bad condition though, so I would definitely go with a guide to understand what you're looking at. Mustafa is a wonderful guide, knowledgeable and witty. He even wrote the troya guidebook that you can buy there ;). Look for him in the restaurant just outside the entrance to the ruins, where they also serve the BEST gözleme of your life!!"
I went to this place and at the far end there are ruins of the city. The film Troy is made in this area and the wooden horse is in the middle of the city. Is this ma myth of a true story?  In the ruins still under renovation and digging for the any sign is also going on. So far no pieces of wood is found. To enter in this place you to purchase a ticket. A go place top visit and refresh your memories in the history.
Really enjoyed visiting the old ruins of Troy. Was a couple hours bus ride from our accomodation in Çanakkale.I recommend a purchase or loan of a book that gives an overview of the different layers or different timelines of ‘Troy’ and shows what the city would of looked like.If you enjoy the story you’ll enjoy the visit.
We got to this place on afternoon. We did the tour by ourselves and got public transportation to go and back. Just be aware on bus timetable on the way back. We missed the 5 Pm bus and we waited till 7:30 pm to get the bus back to downtown. It worth visiting if you like history but Little was remained in the area. Troy was reconstructed 10 times and it’s impressive how archeologists are trying to separate them on their searches. Read before getting here.
"The point of Canakkale city trip is the original horse of Troy & ancient Troy city with many places to go. Do not hesitate to buy one small horse in their official museum , it will help you to member this place when you get old."
"This ancient town and ruins take you back in time.  Imagine how it might have been then, experience it with the audio guide.  Take pictures with the recreated Trojan horse, wear costumes and have pictures taken - great memories.  Entrance fee feels a bit expensive but children are free."
