"You can visited this place everywhere. Beautiful views and many entertainment.Mini zoo, flowers,ocean seashore,that you can see allow have great vacantion. I get absolutely pleasure to be there. I was here in April. This the best time to travel. Weather warm,but not hot. Everything blossomed,so we can enjoy the beauty of nature. Don't forget catch some food (you exactly will  want eat in nature) and you can eat in someone cafe and try delicious Asian food. I recommend this place. Welcome to the park!"
"This place is one stop park for family, they have a zoo, gigantic trampoline, flower park, playground for kids. The entrance fee very cheap around 400yen, you can rent a bike for your convenience, because this park is very large. Come to this place especially at spring, around April, at that time this park has the best view"
"This was an unexpected surprise for us. We saw it briefly on trip advisor, but wehn we saw how far away it was from Hakata (where we were staying) we almost didn't bother. Glad we did! The trains were a bit hard to figure out, as they were on the JR line, rather than standard, and the switch for trains in Kashii was pretty confusing -regional lines seem to presume you know what you're doing- basically you head from Kashii to Umi No Nakamichi and it's the second last stop. Don't fret if you go to far, it's a 10 minutes wait and the train reverses. However we had to switch trains the stop before Umi no Nakamichi - not sure why, but the captain wandered through, spotted us and directed us to opposite side :)We clearly went in off peak, but had a blast. Hire a bike definitely but don't leave any food in your baskets when you get to each stop - it will be taken by the birds - there's warning signs everywhere.We hired a 2 person bike and you just follow the blue lines - there's maps everywhere with where to go and what to stop at. We spent about 3 hours there, and missed most of the sights as we spent the majority of the time enjoying the ride and playing at the forest park - which is essentially a massive petting zoo. Keep in mind we are 2x 30 something year olds, but it was great. The area was massive, the creatures were clean and there were things there I'd never heard of. There are hand washing stations anywhere, so don't pat anything unless you have thoroughly washed. And there are also some cool vending machines that give you these odd biscuit things that snap onhalf and are full of food pellets. The animals know that sound of the machine and head straight to you. From inside their respective areas, the animals are mainly free to roam, so many will mooch right on up to you for a pat.It looked like there were also water rides and rose gardens etc etc, which we didn't get around to, and didn't really try because we went coming into December and figured it would be a touch cold to bother.If you have kids, make a day of it. If you don't, enjoy the ride and stop wherever you want. We had a blast here! (there's also a marine park across the road from this where most people who got off at the trainstop went.)"
"It is a really huge park, a rental bike is available. Recommended to in Spring where a lovely seasonal flower is everywhere."
"Great for activities, can walk, hike or cycle.   Beautiful view of blue flowers and cherry blossoms. Enjoy the coastline scenary.  Great place to educate children on nature, environment, and animals.  Sunshine pool is available during summer.  Children's playground is enough to keep children busy."
Went when the park was venue to a rugby tournament - very tranquil and well laid out.  Lots of attractions - didn't get around to them all but fun was had by all!  The ladies in our group were very impressed with the flower meadow!!!
"I visted on the 30th March 2019, and the cherry blossoms were starting to bloom. The street outside the station at Uminonakamichi Seaside Park was lined in the sakura!There's so much to see and do, you'll need a whole day. Take a picnic, a lot of the locals come prepared with tents and picnic blankets, setting up under the canopy of blossoms.Playgrounds, amusements, floral displays and structures will keep you satisfied, fountains and even a waterfall and flower clock. To top it off, there's a very popular zoo with monkeys, and adorable prarie dogs. There's also a petting zoo, but a long queue too! Entrance is 450 yen pp, and worth every bit"
"We are a family of 4 with 2 young kids (5 & 7).  We arrived at around 11am.  First rented each of us a bicycle to get around this huge park.  They are all sorts of bicycles for all ages (some with supporting wheels, or baby seat).  You'll surely find one suitable.  Bicycles are basically must-have in this park as it is too big for walking from one place to another.  We visite the Forest House which allows to do free wooden crafts.  They provided you with all the tools you need.  And it is air-conditioned, very important in hot summer.  Afterwards, we spend 2 hours at the Sunshine pool which is only open during summer.  The kids had a blast and would not want to leave.  We didn't managed to visit other parts of the park.  Too bad it is closes early.The Sunshine pool has all necessary facilities like lockers, changing room, shower and many eateries.  Be sure to bring a small water proof bag to hold money."
"Using our JR Rail passes we decided ro make a day trip from Osaka to Fukuoka with our 3 children aged 6, 8 and 10.  On the train we came across this park while searching for things to do.  What a brilliant find!  The train from Shin-Hakata was convenient and had some lovely seaside views. Once at the park we put our bags in a locker and hired bikes to get around. They were super cheap to hire and very comfortable.  We visited the amusement park, which our children loved! So many things to do there and a food hall too.  We then biked to the zoo, which had some interesting animals.  The children had pony ride and loved cuddling the guinea pigs.  We then took in the views of the ocean and golden sand beaches and made it back just in time to return our bikes.  While we waited for our train arrived the children were able to walk a goat.   They lady looking after it was very friendly and very kind to our children.  We had a blast!!  We would love to have been there in summer when the water park was open, but there was still plenty to see and do even in Autumn."
Biking tour around the park is great experience. The animals in the zoo is a must see place. Suggest to bike at the outer bicycle routes first followed by inner route.
"A good place to go when the weather is good! And if you are travelling with children. The big open fields are full of flowers, different flowers for each season. The park is also surrounded by the sea. Packed a picnic basket and easily spend half a day here. For those with kids, must go!!  The park is built for families with children.  There are many playgrounds,  water park (that opens in summer),  and animal petting area. Most importantly,  they are so much open fields for them to run wild! Big park by walkable by foot. Bicycles are also available for rental. Easily accessible by train (40 min)  from Fukuoka."
"If you are travelling with small children or even teens..Uminonakamichi Seaside Park is worth the visit if you ars in Fukuoka, Japan.By bus it is around an hour and you will get the chance to see around the city, university,outskirts and residential dwellings..the bus stop is at Tenjin in front of the Post Office and has a timetable. Don't worry everything is clockwork on time that is why we love love love Japan. You can even take a train to the park.The part is massive consist of playground, playground and more playground for the whole family to enjoy. A rose garden & flower hills for mummy to enjoy. The park entrance fees is 450 yen for adults and free for children below 12 years old. The park closes at 5.30pm so please planned your journey. A mini zoo with kangaroos and birds closes at 5pm and a mini golf too.Huge lakes to relax to. The food court is non halal so it is advisable to bring your own food and snacks.We really enjoy our visit at the park we went to the park 2 days in a row..hope if you are ever in Fukuoka and wants an activity with your children..do drop by the park."
"Little far out there but worth the time and effort to get out there to spend a sunny afternoon.  Yes, like other reviewers have said, this place is huge.  Don't worry, you can rent bicycles to get yourself around on the pathway at a reasonable price.  There is an animal zoo, flower garden, jungle gym for children,  water pool play area and probably lots other stuff that we didn't have the chance to see or do. If you bring food, just remember to stow it away or keep it with you when you park your bike.  There are birds that will devour it before you return."
"You can spend ALL day here! There are bikes for rent so you can get around the area quickly with several attractions peppered throughout. Tandom bikes, bikes for kids, or bikes with seats for your little ride-alongs. Whether you arrive by ferry, bus, train, or car, there are maps located all around the park. You can make your way to a park with roller slides and arcade games, an aquarium, a zoo, and even a waterpark. Each of these stops has it's own entrance fee, so expect to spend a bundle...but it's so much fun! Nursing stations were available and western toilets were easily found. Bring your sunscreen and a change of clothes so you're ready for the splash pad or water park."
"Wow. This park looked amazing on google maps, but when we went there it was even more spectacular. We went here for 3 hours in September. Took a ferry from Hakata port (a very nice 15 min ride, not too many waves and you get to see great distance view of hakata city) to Saitozaki ferry terminal. This park is enormous, best way to see everything without taking forever is to hire a bike. It's around 500Yen for 3-4 hours. There are designated bike paths in the park, however you can take the bike in certain areas where there is lot of foot traffic. There are lot of bike stops where you can park and have a walk through different attractions. There is a bit of everything at this seaside park, there is a zoo, bird area, picnic areas, lot of gardens and is very kid friendly too - such as kids pools, picnic benches etc. Great place to go to escape the city for a few hours, especially on a lovely sunny day, whether your a couple or a family, there's something to do for everyone. When we went, there wasn't too many flowers blooming. This place must be exploding with people during cherry blossom season....If you go to Fukuoka, be sure to come check this place out, you won't regret it xD"
"What a great park! Not expensive at all and my kids (4 and 11) loved it! We took the municipal ferry from Hakata Port to the island (Saitozaki stop, 15 minutes), which was also cheap and great fun for the kids.At the park, they have play structures suitable for many ages and an eating area where you can grab some quick dishes (pork-broth ramen and similar things). Bring lots of cash in the form of coins and 1000 yen notes – you buy food and tickets from machines. Pools open in July, but there is a wading pool. The animal area is great, the kids loved walking inside the kangaroo and capybara enclosures, getting close-up experiences. The flowers are plentiful and lovely. I only wish we would could have had more time, as we were rushing through the park a bit during the 4 hours we were there. Plan for a whole day outing and bring snacks, plenty of water, swimwear and towels during the warm months! Sunhats and UV-clothing or suncreen for kids is also recommended during summertime as there is not always very much shade when you walk between the areas. The best time we had in Fukuoka was here, don't miss it!"
"Very friendly guides at the entrance. Nice biking path good for families. You can rent any type of bike you want upon entering. Take note that biking and walking paths are different. Make sure to get a map when you enter. Also, for those with kids I recommend you go straight to Wonder World where there is a huge sand and playground area as well as a toddler pool. Make sure to bring swimsuits for them. There is also an aircon area where the kids can play. Sadly only four stars because there is NO PLACE TO EAT HERE! We went there hungry and left hungry."
"This is one of my favorite park in Fukuoka. You can reach this park using a train from Kashii station. Stopped at uminonakamichi station. You can also reach this place by bus. This park provides a complete attraction for kids and family. There is a mini zoo inside the park, children grand park as a huge playground for kids, flower garden, seaside area, etc. You can rent a bike inside the park and explore the whole area or you can also use the shuttle bus inside the park. Near the children playground, there is a foodcourt which provides japanese foods and western foods."
expecting for more roses during May.  I must commend the gardeners for maintaining the place.  Hope that they provide more seating areas.
"I would have given it ""Good"", but TripAdvisor goes from ""Average"" straight to ""Very Good"".We took the ferry to come here.  When you arrive, you can rent bicycles in the same building where you can buy your return ticket for the ferry but here you can rent only until 3 pm.  Wait until you reach the park (if you were going there) and you can rent bikes until 6 pm.The park is quite big, so bicycles are quite useful to move around.In the park, you can find a kind of mini-zoo with different species of monkeys, some kangaroos, some wallabies, and many other kinds of anymals.There is a playground for kids.  There is a kind of small amusemment park, or it may be more accurate to say that there are a few rides.You can buy food and drinks at a few places; they have vending machines for drinks and there are toilets, which are free.  Food and drinks are a bit expensive, so you might want to bring something to drink before leaving town.Initially, we wanted to visit around the park  after visiting there, but we got surprised by the rain, so we took a ferry back earlier than intended."
Some seasons are better than others so find out what's in bloom before you go. This past May roses were about the only good sight. Doing cherry blossom season this place is spectacular. You can get there by ferry or train (have to change trains once). There is also an antique car museum. The bicycle rental is a good option.
