"Booked a free guided tour in Toyota and it was such a memorable tour of the manufacturing plant.The guide was extremely knowledgable as he used to work as engineer in the plant. Every highlights and major milestones that the company went through was brought to live! You will find a complete set of their models from day one until now. Best part is the robot playing violin at the end of the tour when the plant closes. So impressed with the level of detail and professionalism in this attraction. If you are car enthusiast, must see, don’t miss this."
"This museum was the reason I stopped of in Nagoya and I  was not disappointed. Starts off in the textile section,  then through the to the automotive section. Easily spent a couple of hours there."
"We visited this museum on May 26, 2017. This was a very interesting and educational place to visit and we fell in love with this museum. We got there right before they opened. First we went into the looms warehouse. Looms are weaving machines. We were so happy to see this because we had no idea we would find such huge display of looms, the history and the time line of the Toyoda Looms Works who later became Toyota Motor Corporation.  You can observe the many different types of looms from the antique and very simple models to the very huge more modern types. The entrance fee is very affordable and it is a very popular place to visit. I recommend going early.  After seeing the looms area which by the way is very big, we moved on to the car display warehouse or show room. Again we were amazed to learn the history of how Toyoda became Toyota and the whole line of cars that were produced in the early years. This is an amazing place to visit and it will not let you down. They have a gift shop and a place to buy food as well. Do not miss going to this museum when you are in Nagoya. Strongly recommend it!"
"Looked long and hard for the best attraction on Nagoya for 2 teenage boys, and they really liked it. We skipped the textile part, and spent over 2 hours at the automotive displays, and only left when it closed. Great interactive exhibits on how cars work and how they are made."
"So we were in Nagoya for the Formula one Race at Suzuka and we decided to go to this museum when we had some down time. Firstly, it was great to try and find because it is in one of the original buildings, therefore not exactly in the tourist area. Anyway we had a nice walk through some backstreets to find the place even though there is a train station almost out the front haha (found this out later). I am a massive tech nerd and this museum was the best i have ever been through, even my wife loved it!!. The journey takes you through Toyoda company's history in textiles (with live demos) into manufacturing and the auto industry. Almost every exhibit is interactive and you get to see how all of these machines work. I never knew how an automatic transmission in a car worked and now i do. Also i got to see a humanoid robot play canon in D which is my favourite classical song. For me, if your in Nagoya, this is a must do. Loved it. Well done to everyone there"
"I had an hour to spend at the Toyota Commemorative Museum and it was not nearly enough time.... The weaving section or the automotive section.... decisions, decisions!  We focused on the automotive and made time for the violin playing robot near the end!  I really enjoyed the beautiful facility and the displays.  On a side note this is an unusual museum in that many of the displays are kept in running order and are working while the visitors watch.  Want to learn more about how a car works? they have a display with all the key structures clearly visible and moving!!"
"This is an excellent place to with family.  No doubt the whole museum is a propaganda of Toyota, its story is inspiring and still worth learning.  The museum is clean and well maintained.  Some games and self-made souvenirs are free.  Transportation by bus (loop line) from Nagoya station is easy, the second stop from Nagoya station.  Coming back to Nagoya station by Meitetsu is also quick and not complicated.  As a half-day activity, this is a good choice."
"I decided to go here based on a review that raved about a part of the museum that we didn't even get to visit! Still enjoyed it!  The first section of the museum is about textiles that were made by the Toyoda company before they got into the car business.  The sheer quantity of machinery they have here is astounding.  I'd recommend trying to spend under an hour in the first part so you don't get so burned out that you don't appreciate the rest.  Honestly, you could spend a full 8 hour day in this museum. The second part of the museum is automobiles, of course.  There are a ton of interactive exhibits that explain how a car works.  Throughout the museum (both textile + cars) there are staff members giving demonstrations and explanations in both Japanese and English -- maybe not everyday, but we went on a weekend.  The final segment of the museum is an area probably designed for kids but anyone can enter.  However, this is a ticketed attraction that has reservations for entrance times.  We didn't realize that until very late in the day, and couldn't get into that section for another 2 hours because it was all full.  Ask about how to reserve a time for it when you get your tickets.I would definitely go back here.  Entrance fees were insanely cheap considering what you get.There is a cafe inside and a gift shop, too."
"We were there to see why this place is no 1 in tripadvisor for Nagoya. It was indeed justified. The tour started from textile machines, then we are transitioned to history on how kichiro toyoda started car business, and the current  technology edge of Toyota and Lexus cars. It was an eye opening of perseverance and successful for Toyota. We spent easily 3-4 hours there to see the whole thing ! make sure you attend the spot demonstration of robot as well."
I'm not an engineering type but so glad I picked this Museum when I had a few hours in Nagoya.  It is an easy 25 min walk from the train station.  I took the English language tour of the textile portion and it helped me understand the main points of each machine.  I did the auto section alone but wish  I'd had time to do the tour.  I did really enjoy the film of the factory and then watching all the machines work right in front of me.  Don't miss it!
"Went here on a Sunday afternoon and was very impressed with what was available to see.  I am by nature a museum geek and this one was high up on the list for most interesting.In short, the museum is broke up into 4 main parts:1) Loomworks2) Automotive3) Metal works4) Technology I spent a small time in loomworks and a majority in automotive (I work in automotive).  In both portions of museum, what amazed me most was the amount of hands on, active exhibitions they had.  For the loomworks, there must have been 50 or more loom machines that various workers were operating when people came up.  For the automotive, they had the same type of on hands exhibitions.  Specifically, they took you through the different mfg processes of building a car.  Forging, Casting, Machining, Pressing, Welding, Painting, Assembly.  All of it was super hands on and authentic to real processes.Cost was so cheap (500 yen + 200 yen optional rental for audio set).  The Toyota companies sponsor the museum which makes it so cheap the public.Please take time to go here as it was great.Onegai shimasu!"
Our family visited here in August. There are many locals (families and school) visited this museum.  But we do not find it crowded at all.  It is very neat.  Recommend to go.
I went thinking would just be a mock factory you walk through.  I was very wrong. They had a huge area on textiles with ancient looms and advancing up to current methods of making cloth. The car area walked you through the history of every part of the car. They did have mock sections of a factory and explained the process and then they moved into future cars. Was there only a couple hours but could easily stayed longer. There were also interactive things for kids to do
"This museum was absolutely amazing! I would suggest it as an absolute must see for all car enthusiasts! Beginning with the back story behind Toyota and how it became to be what it is today progressing through to interactive displays including cut open sections of gearboxes, engines, alternators, starter motors and much much more to give an in-depth insight into how each component works. The lower floor included displays on the manufacturing processes in making a car. This would be an absolutely priceless experience for a young apprentice mechanic or someone interested in getting into the trade!"
"Visited this great museum in the former Toyota weaving factory. Visited the two pavilions with a free tour led in English. The guide was great, indoor marine and entertaining. We did one tour of the Weaving Pavillon and a second of the Automotive Pavillon. Many innovations came out of the Toyota efforts. Displays are very informative and well done even for someone who isn’t very mechanical."
"Had the pleasure to check out this fantastic museum.  All the textile machines and auto machines displayed work and they show them working.  This is a quick museum pit stop but the cost is minimal 500 yen, worth the price to see the robots."
Loved the Toyota Commemorative Museum. The looms and automobile museum were amazing.  Wheelchair accessible.  Beautiful old cars as well as new ones.  The robotic manufacturing display was awesome.  We stayed about an hour but could have spent more time.  We walked from the Nagoya Station took about 20 minutes.
"In Nagoya for business and stuck for what to do at the weekends, a friend suggested a visit to Toyota. Very easy to get to, really friendly and informative staff. The cars are everything, some of the rarest models you will ever see and get very close to. So pleased to see a Datsun 2000GT, Bugatti, Gull wing Mercedes and the modern Lexus LFE. The museum is such a delight, family friendly or just on your own. Thank you Toyota, a thoroughly enjoyable experience."
The museum is quite big. Minimum of an hour to go around. You can explore it at your own leisure but you have to pay for the entrance fee. About 400 yen. discounted. There are a lot of staff inside who can answer your questions and even take your picture. The museum also has wheelchairs for the elderly or for the disabled. They offer it for free. There are also restrooms inside. It has a central courtyard.  Very interesting.
"I'm a Toyota fan, my car is a corolla altis. We went to the museum via the Meguru bus which you can catch just outside the Nagoya station. I was awed by the vision of the company founder and his son. The journey from textiles to cars was well demonstrated by the exhibits. Some of the tour guides really try their best to show the exhibits and read aloud the English prompt cards despite their lack of fluency. Capping off the tour were the model cars on the ground floor. Wish I could just drive off in the luxurious Toyopet! But the futuristic Mirai model may well be my next car.Really enjoyed the tour. Even if you're not a car fanatic you may wish to come here if you're over dosed on shrines & castles."
"Where it all started! A trip to memory lane. Located around the Nagoya downtown, serviceable by Me-Guru sight-seeing bus"
"Amazing museum,a must for any car enthusiast. be prepared to spend a couple of hours here. the cars are beautifully displayed. Well worth the visit"
Had a in depth understanding on how Toyota manufactures Toyota vehicles and Lexus premium cars. We were explained on the stringent checks on its cars and the different explanation on its assembly lines. The tour guide told us the history of Toyota and how Toyota became one of the largest automobile brands in the world!
A lot of exhibits to go through. Some fun activities for kids too. Note long walk from subway station. Should consider taking the 'yellow' tour bus.
"The museum is not very big and can easily cover in 2hrs. However, if you are bringing kids, be prepared to stuck for very long cos they will find it very fascinating with all the machine demo n there's an indoor kids playarea! It's a nice place to bring small kids to. Buy the Nagoya 1 day bus pass to get 100yen discount on the entrance tickets. There is a cafe at the entrance area too and they provide reasonable delicious food at a good price."
500 yen a little over 4 euro. Take your time walking around. Plenty to see and tour guides are very helpful. We'll worth a visit.
"We arrived at Nagoya station at around 2 pm, directly go to Toyota commemorative museum. We took a city bus from the bus center inside the station. Pay ¥210/person (for the bus).Only 1 or 2 stops, and then walk for about 3-5 minutes from the station. Inside, we need to pay for admission fee ¥500/ person and they got FREE coin lockers 😀You need to put ¥100 to use it, but you will get your coin back.The museum itself was very interesting and give lots of information about Toyota and their history also about the machines they build. They have a guided tour (certain time) and audio translator but you need to pay extra.Overall it was a unique and interesting experience 😁 You should visit when coming to Nagoya. Oh and they have like a small game stations after you exit the museum. And it’s free too.. just show your ticket to the officers 👮‍♀️"
"Paid the museum a visit and saw the many industrial machines, automobiles and assembly equipment. Finally understood the connection between weaving and automobile. The place is good for a short 2-3 hour visit. Many of the exhibits allow some the visitors to press a button and watch what happen."
"Not really my scene but suprisingly enjoyed it. Loved the car of the future and also the one person pod vehicles. Cars from days gone by and all sorts of makes, makes one realise how far we have come in the vehicle industry. Three floors to explore and druel over. Cost to enter $1000 yen."
"Loved touring the plant.  From the past to present, it did not disappoint.  It is a fantastic museum, very well run with all the different stations of productivity in the textiles machines.   Put it on your list of places to visit while in Nagoya."
A very nice & tourist friendly museum. Great place to learn more about Toyota's history. Most folks are unaware what Toyota were manufacturing before being the top car producer in the world. Visit the museum to find out more.Was a bit disappointed with the Toyota gift shop for not selling specialty gifts geared towards Toyota/Lexus car fanatics.
Enjoyed so much we spent more time there than expected. Fun games style entertainment area for kids that you should reserve on entry. No extra fee just limited space per hour. Kids got to make an AA car toy and stamp a metal key ring souvenir. Fun & educational. young kids and teenagers can enjoy.
Have to admit that we are very interested in industrial history but even so this is a really great museum. We learnt a lot and had not appreciated how Toyota was originally a textile firm.Everything is available in English.Staff are really helpful.Its only 500 Yen.Several demonstrations of different machines - check out the timetable for these as you do not want to miss the circular loom and the robot playing the violin!Good value café and nice gift shop.We were there about three hours but could have stayed longer - its huge.Access is also easy - its a ten minute train journey from Nagoya Central and then a five minute walk.When we were there - a weekday in late October - it was comparatively empty.
"Toyota commemorative museums is easily one of the best museums for people who want to learn n also for automobile n handloom lovers. There r more than 4000 exhibits n more than 50% r actual working ones. You can actually see the looms run, cotton convert into thread, history of toyota, see how forgings are made, see how robots work to weld a car, paint a car... an overview of the assembly process in olden days. Though our trip was for only 1.5 hrs, i felt minimum 4 hrs r required for covering the entire museum. If u want a guide u can be one of the 1st 20 customers. It opens at 9:30am. But even without a guide you can understand most of it. English or japanese you'll not hv a problem. The demonstrators r very courteous which is typical of the Japanese culture. There's also a museum shop where you can buy some artefacts related to Toyota like scaled versions of actual cars. One'll also get to know the entire history of Toyota. Fascinating and rivetting. Must go if u r around this place in Japan. You can reach Nagoya by the Shinkansen n hire a taxi to this place or a metro taxi combo. Have fun."
"Very technical, but worth a visit! Makes you think about all the millions of processes that go into making cars and machinery. Not as engaging as the Nagoya Science Museum."
