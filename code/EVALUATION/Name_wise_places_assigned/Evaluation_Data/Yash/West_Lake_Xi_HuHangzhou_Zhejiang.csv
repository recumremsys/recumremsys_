"Took a dragon boat out on the island. If you go to Hangzhou you must do this. The island is steeped in history and mystery and the scenery is absolutely fantastic. Fortunately many of the plaques that tell you about the different areas are also in English.Further along the shore walking with the lake on your left, keep going and you will find a wonderful tea room. Go to the top floor and the view is out over the lake. The Westlake green tea here is fantastic."
Enjoyed our half day tour along Xihu. Took the boat and went to the middle of the island. A very touristy thing to do. Lots of tourists.
Guess this is the highlight of Hangzhou.  Spend a full day at West Lake...took the ferry...should try it.
"It is not a huge lake but considered the most beautiful lake in China.  But make sure you come on a sunny day to appreciate it, otherwise, it'll just be good but not great.  Also make sure you try the following:1) The boat ride to the island in the middle of the lake, San Tan Yin Yue.  That is where the ancient poets, emperors, etc. made a resting place and the shape is interesting (circle with a cross in the middle).2) Walk on Duan Qiao Chan Xue.  On that bridge looking outward towards the lake is considered the ""most beautiful spot"".  And it's associated with a famous ancient Chinese love story.  I'll leave it to your tour guide to explain it to you.3) The tourist park area west of the lake.  Lots of hidden jewels in there.  Ancient temples, amazing tea houses (with the most authentic famous Long Jin Tea) and a great trail that walks through 9 creeks (30 minutes walk).You have NOT visited West Lake if you haven't done these"
visited this part of Hangzhou as part of a trip a deal tour. This is a nice area to walk around and get something to eat and bargain with the locals.Small boat trip across the lake was pleasant.
"55 yuan takes you to a very small island and back, keep the ticket! walk around island, lots of greenery, bridges and photo spots... one yuan picture shows the water sculptures. recommended meutermedia"
It’s my favourite place in Hangzhou. One the most beautiful lake in world.It’s very big lake. Surrounded by lots of parks. Great place for walkers. Scenery from lake are awesome.You can walk as much as you can surrounding the lake. Nice tea shop located nearby. View of lake from shop is excellent.
"Take MTR to Xi Hu, had a boat ride visit the lake. lot of thinks to see and eat. If leaving early there, you can take a bus to Lingyin Temple for CHN$2. A must go place in Hangzhou."
"I advise you to visit this wonderful place and also the beautiful, clean and modern city of Hangzhou! Don't miss them!"
"We spent a few hours here. The West Lake is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.   Taking a boat cruise on the Lake is the best way to view numerous cultural sites,pagodas and Temples, also the artificial lakes with many willows, their draping foliage, all so utterly mesmerising.    So calming and peaceful. A beautiful place to visit"
Went here for a show.i could not believe it was all in the lake.I assume they have placed a platform just below the water. I saw hundreds of performers dance sign ballet and play instruments with a light show going on.. it was marvelous and produced by the same guy who did the Biejing opening ceremony. Really worth it to see .
"West Lake is supposed to be a must-visit attraction in Hangzhou. But if you are not interested in renting a boat, you can essentially take in everything it has to offer in half an hour. Visit it to check it off your Chinese bucket list but go eat at the famous Lou Wai Lou Restaurant along its shores."
"In China, people always use heavenly beauty to describe the sceneray of the West Lake and you will not challenge it if you have personally visited this spot. Surrounding West Lake, there are also mountains, temples, nunnery, pavilions and pagodas. You can learn so many stories with abundant history behind those scenery spots, some are real and some reflect people's kind wishes. Traffic is convenient in Hangzhou as well, with frequent, reasonably charged and widely covered underground and bus services. A nice place for travel."
"We hired a car & was driven around the lake. Started to walk from the Broken Bridge, it was raining & a blanket of mist (or was it haze?) hung in the air. The lake was dotted with tourist boats. Lotus clusters fringed the lake make for Insta-worthy shots!Take a break in the Lou Wai Lou Restaurant or dine in any of the upscale hotels. Then head for Lei Fung Pagoda to take in the West Lake views from up high."
"This is not just a Hangzhou treasure, it’s a National Treasure! Be aware that on weekends it gets very crowded and there’s not a lot of “crowd control,” but if you head to a less visited section of Xi Hu you’ll still be able to experience the fabulous sights but won’t be jostling for a spot to take a photo. You can easily walk or bike or take one of the small open-air shuttles to further reaches of the lake."
After visiting the Lingying temple complex i headed to visit the West lake in our pvt taxi its not far from the temple if just 10 minutes far from the temple .The day of our visit the temperature dropped to 7 degree Celsius and it was pretty cold at the lake because one side it is surrounded by the mountains .Basically the lake is surrounded by a long circular road which is walkable with ferry stations where u can take ferry ride in 45 rmb to go to the middle island and hop on to another ferry to go the other side of the lake or you can take the battery car to take the lake trip via road . Take note of the place / or the lake side where your taxi driver leaves you  so that you can return there at the end .Mcdonalds and Starbucks are very near to beishang street side . Three hours is enough for this place and if you go late evening you can see the laser show also
The West Lake is UNESCO listed and a beautiful setting.  Take  aride on one of the many cruise boats to get a closer look at the Pagoda's that dot the lake's edge or visit the many little shops that provide a range of chinese foods and souvenirs.
"Beautiful West Lake, very picturesque. Walk around to the pagoda on the other side. Can rent little boats. Lots of tourists but surprisingly it doesnt feel overcrowded."
"If in Hangzhou, you must visit West Lake. It is a World Heritage Site. The boat ride is very nice. Take bug repellant. Look for the 3 lanterns in the lake."
"We did a one hour boat tour on the lake. Our bus tour group walked about a km through thousands of people to get on a boat with Chinese tour guides with loud speaker systems  rattling our heads. The lake area is picturesque, but the noise and crowds take a great deal away from the experience. We then walked about a km back through thousands of people to our tour bus. Being an Atlantic Canadian with abundant access to uncluttered waterways and beautiful landscape, I found this to be a ridiculous exercise in getting outdoors in a beautiful area."
"The West Lake is definitely a must when visiting Hangzhou!Last year, I went to Hangzhou with my classmates for school trip. It was light rain and soft wind when we arrived at West Lake. We took a boat on the West Lake. The air smelt like grass and a bit wet. I couldn’t stop breathing it in. Then, we arrived in a small island which called “ Three Pools Mirroring the Moon ”. There were a lot of trees, temples and ancient houses. It was really a good place to head for a walk. I also took quite a few photos because I wanted to keep this happy memory. An hour passed, it was time to leave, but no one wanted to do so, we were all attracted by the beautiful view.For lunch, we went to a famous local restaurant——Louwailou Restaurant. We tasted many famous Hangzhou cuisine. Dongpo pork, Beggar's chicken, fried shrimps with Longjing tea, and West Lake fish are among the most popular dishes. They were delicious!West Lake is among my top three choices in Hangzhou! Looking forward to going back!Tip: It is often rainy in Hangzhou, so you’d better bring a umbrella with you if you go outside. But don’t worry, it won’t be rainy so heavily, and it feel really soft and comfortable. Just in case."
"Take a boat ride in the lake and walk around or travel by rickshaw .. evening time is good. the West Lake area in Hangzhou, comprising of the West Lake and the surrounding hills, which have inspired famous poets, scholars and artists since the 9th Century.It is considered one of the most beautiful landscapes in China, and is home to numerous temples, pagodas, pavilions, gardens, causeways and artificial islands. While you’re in the West Lake scenic area, visit to a tea plantation, here you will learn about tea picking and processing."
"This lake is deeply beautiful, and one of the most picturesque sights on our tour of 6 eastern Chinese cities.  Take a boat tour and also walk around the park.  Aim for sunset if you can!"
"Visited this place in evening and again on another day at night. It's amazing, water is calm, mountains are Serene and once can seen various temples.Must visit place for anyone visiting Hangzhou!"
"West Lake is beautiful, very nice to walk around after dinner.  All of Hangzhou is very nice, I prefer visiting Hangzhou over Shanghai.  West Lake is surrounded by lovely parks, walkways, cafes, restaurants, and pubs.  During the holidays it can be very busy and crowded, but definitely, you should go during the offseason.  I was there most recently in mid-October, after Golden Week and the temperature was perfect.  Getting to Lingyin Temple was easy and made for a nice day trip."
"A must do experience if you are in Hangzhou. Do a river cruise and spend the day meandering through the islands and boardwalks. A very peaceful, though busy, place."
Went to the west lake with family and enjoyed walking in the garden alongside and did a boat trip of the west lake. wonderful experience especially if you have a good guide to explain the history.
"Came to West Lake with UTO - I believe they wanted $30 USD for a 30 minute boat tour. Yes folks, you read that right! A dollar a minute! They pressure you into this cruise - which we skipped and chose to explore on foot. I couldn’t be happier! First things first, that $30 cruise? Is only around $4 if you skip the tour group booking and just go pay for it yourself. The lake is stunning! We had a great time walking around snapping photos and taking in the scenery. The people you will meet make it fun too. There is a healthy mix of tourists and locals. If you’re a blonde haired blue eyed woman, be prepared to be asked for selfies. This is worth a stop but if you are with a tour group and they want $30 pass on it! The time on foot with your travel companion is worth so much more!"
"Be careful, the Hangzhou government has ordered stray dogs to be killed on the spot. Instead of enjoying a boat tour on West Lake you could end up watching the drowning of a stray dog. Started on 15th of November and is still going."
"The lake is a very serene place, a true beauty of nature. Riding the Chinese lake boat was a fun experience for me, my husband & friends. We all admire the nice view & our walk on the lake side was another beautiful experience observing 3 married couples on their wedding attire taking photos. I was touched with the legend of the Butterfly Lovers attached to this lake."
Worth while visit. Make sure you go with a knowledgeable guide that can tell you the history and the stories (the White Snake lady is my favourite). Allow enough time to walk at least half-way round so that you can experience the people and the various bridges and islands.
Visited the West Lake in October 2018;stayed at a hotel which is about 15mins walking to  the scenic area.West Lake is one of the most beautiful lakes in China and also is an UNESCO site.You can walk around the lakes or take a boat ride ;it is beautiful here:day or night!!!
"It is a relatively peaceful park and lake complex that is quite large. Having said that there is no escape from the crowds of local and overseas visitors and wedding groups and photographers. It is possible to take a small bus ride around the lake - they run on the footpath, there are boats to hire and there are also larger boats that cross the lake. Enjoy the greenery and relative quiet but walking on the grass is forbidden."
"There is just so much history and tales surrounding the West Lake of Hangzhou. Exploring the entire place would probably take up a whole day or 2 half days as it is just that big. A suggestion as a 'route' would be to follow with the ten sights of west lake that has been critically acclaimed by scholars, artists and even emperors throughout history. The large boat ride costs about 50 yuan and that should be the only thing that you may have to pay to get around. Smaller private boats would have a different pricing not too sure about that. The lake boasts a central island (Sam Tan Yin Yue) which would require the boat ride to get on. Other attractions around the area includes Yue Fei temple/mausoleum, Leifeng Pagoda and Broken bridge."
"Visit the lake on a full moon night, it is very quiet and beautiful. the visit was not long as I was on a working trip"
