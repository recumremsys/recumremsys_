"Now I’m not a big shopper, but wether your into malls or not it’s still a good place to visit if your in the area. The waterfront walk alongside the shopping malls is very pleasant especially on a warm day, plenty of places to sit and people watch, and boy will there be plenty of people to watch, it’s very popular for locals and tourists alike. Call in at the ‘Hard Rock’ if you fancy a beer and burger, visit the old 1930s sailing ship in the dock, have a spin on the ferris wheel of get an even better view from the Landmark Tower (tallest in Japan) if it’s a clear day you can easily see Mt Fuji. Then catch the Seabas (sea-bus) to points around the bay."
From modern shopping to unusual dining in old wearhouses Minato Mirai is a full day attraction. I went to the Tower Mall and visited the old dry dock at the base. You can feel the history of Japan in its pre WWII days. Found the Yokohama Hard Rock Cafe In the mall and enjoyed  walking through the store. I enjoyed looking at the old ship docked right by the mall. I couldn’t see the entire area because there was so much to see and do.
"Being here alone for business purposes I found this district very accessible with nice sceneries (the wheel, the gorgeous nippon maru, skyscrapers and such) and much to do (shopping, eating and drinking). Absolutely worth a visit when you are here! You will not fill a day here and the best time for a visit would be around 4-5 pm and onwards (as many nice lighting in the evening)"
"One of the good things is to have a large parking lots attached to the building complex since we tend to drive rather than train and walk for our shopping. Of course, they are conveniently located for those who come by train. If I have a guest, love to take them to the sky garden on the Landmark Tower for a great view. In the building, they have a huge shopping mall where we can get most of our stuff from books, clothes, jewelry, toys and a variety of foods. Attached to the Landmark Tower, you can walk to Queen’s Square and the Mark is. Those combined shopping district is large enough to satisfy our needs."
"Basically if you into urban exploratation, you can spend days here, there are so many shopping centers, shops, restaurants, bars, entertainment between the offices that one finds new things after a week. Do not miss the Landmark Tower (or you can glimpse the Fuji in good weather for free from the Sky Tower elevator lobby on all twenty-somethingth floors) and check out the restaurants!"
"Did a walking loop around the area from Landmark Plaza, to World Porters, and back.  Combined with a bright blue sky (and high heat), the scenery was beautiful and made for some really great photographs.  After spending many days in Tokyo, this area definitely gave you a better feel of wide open spaces in an urban environment, with the venues also having a sense of being visually connected.  A contrast to Odaiba, which does the wide open spaces thing well, but connected only by the Yurikamome.  I wasn't able to stick around for sunset (weather was changing quickly), but will have to take a night time stroll on a future visit.Also, the now-annual Pikachu Dance Invasion was in full swing when I was there, and you could not escape seeing the little yellow Pokémon everywhere throughout the district."
"Great place to visit , lots to see and do , not too far from China town . In good weather a nice walk for everyone. Enjoy."
"Tons of shopping, restaurants and if you're lucky, a Pikachu Outbreak! Wear your walking shoes, there are several shopping malls all clumped together and more restaurants and cafes than you can count!"
"Understand the secondary yuan should be clear, yokohama is a lot of famous animation scenes, as anime powder must go to pilgrimage. Yokohama have a Gundam museum, there have a Gundam many people will take pictures. There are many models on display in the museum, selling type is complete, a carelessly will buy too much. If you want to see the night scenery of the yokohama to eat must first make an appointment in advance, otherwise there is no place to sit, my friends and I finally did not see the night scene while eating. But if you don't mind to see at night, there are many food shops are very cheap and delicious, choice is also very rich. After dinner we go to sit the ferris wheel, intentional, such as a fully transparent carriages, feel special stimulation, and also put the dinner on the ferris wheel didn't see the night scenery of all repair back."
"If you are staying in a hotel in area, good shopping and great food below main floor.  Lots of inexpensive places for a good meal.  Take the esculators down."
"Enjoy walking along the waterfront before you get to the next museum, shoping mall or amusement park. Specially in the evening this area is really impressive with all its lights and colors."
"This popular bayfront district encompasses something for everyone.  In a bustling city of 60 million people this newer central area is an eclectic mix of business, shopping, entertainment, and waterfront parks and plazas which focuses on green spaces, and human interaction. This area attracts both locals and visitors. Enjoy a pleasant boardwalk stroll from Yamashita Park to Rinko Park and experience a necklace of gardens & parks with magnificent views, creative art, and people enjoying life without any vehicular traffic.   Home to many major attractions it highlights are Cosmo World amusement park, stand up paddle boarding on the river channels, Queen's Square, Landmark Tower, Marine & Walk,  Red Brick Warehouse, Osanbashi Pier, Cupnoodle Museum, several historic ships, Art, Maritime, & Silk Museums, a wide variety of eateries and cafes, and much more !   A must visit area, which was the highlight of Tokyo for us."
"After the land-based, farm-centric visits to the castles and koens, I am reminded that Japanese are also maritime and sea-faring folks. The promenade is beautifully landscaped and scattered with statues and momentos of its maritime heritage. It is also excellent for day activities for kids as it has attractions and ferris wheel similar like in Osaka. If weather does not cooperate, you could spend several hours (and thousand dollars) shopping and eating and cinema at Collet Mare Shopping Malls. If you still have energy and credit limit in your card, head to the Aeon mall about 1 km from the station. For the Captain Haddock's fans, you must visit inside the Nipppon Maru. Allocate at least a full day for this - enjoy lunch outside."
"If you are around Yokohama, can't miss this must of the city. Enjoy the large mall next to the pier and the view of the wheel!!!"
"Started off as a curiosity in the city, became an adventure, and ended as a memory to never be forgotten!!! Ferris wheel, roller coasters, G-force spinning rides, city life, arcades, and more!!!! Restaurants and shopping nearby!!!"
"Had a great afternoon here. A very different vibe to Tokyo and other areas of Japan. Lots of great shops, restaurants  and very relaxing seaside area. Definitely worth a visit."
"Combine this with the Nissin Ramen museum and amusement park which is right across the street. Simple to get to from the train station. Just look at the picture, it is exactly like that. Called MM21, mega cool food court with an area which resemble Hawaii. Too much to list to buy BUT you can buy  Kit-Kat in many odd flavor a that only Japan offers. Potato, cheese, green tea, coke, and other crazy flavors. Lots of people there. Cute girls and cool guys. Be careful if your on a budget because you'll spend a lot in this place. Oh and 10 minutes walk is the famous Red Brick building on the bay. Actually you will spend all day within this area. Go for it. Bring a map and a small blanket so you can catch a cat nap in the bay park."
Lots of brand name shops including Tokyo Hands. Lots of small restaurants that serve local food. Attached to hotel and subway  that makes it convenient.
"I had such a great and amazing day trip at Yokohama (especially around the Minato Mirai 21 area) that I am planning another trip to Japan, specifically to Yokohama in Dec to spend a few days! If you are in Tokyo, I would highly recommend you visit Yokohama - either a day trip or spend a couple of days here. It is just 35-45mins by train from Tokyo (Shimbashi to Yokohama). The view (both day time and night time) of the Yokohama port is simply stunning! Spent a couple of hours just walking along side the port and taking in the beautiful view. Interesting places to visit around this area are - Landmark Tower Sky Garden (great view of Yokohama from the top), Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse, Osanbashi Pier (stunning view!), shopping malls, Hard Rock Cafe Yokohama, Cup Noodles museum and many more! One can easily spend a day here, which is what we did.We took a train from Shimbashi on the JR Tokaido Line to Yokohama station, which cost us 470yen - so easy and convenient.

"I visited my husband who is working in the Minato Mirai area. The area is very clean and modern and has lots to do in the day time. There is not much in the way of night life but this is not a concern for me. The malls have a fantastic selection of shops and the World Porters mall is definitely worth a visit. There is a huge selection of eateries of all types of food. If you want to venture further you can walk to China Town, the Baseball Stadium, or the lovely area of Motomachi. There are great tube links straight from in the mall to Tokyo , Yokohama, or the Motomachi area. Going to the top of Landmark Tower is a must! I do not like heights but the lift whisks you up the 69 floors in about 20 seconds and the view is amazing. There are toilets, a shop, a bar, and a cafe up the top. If you get a clear day you can see Mt Fuji. You can also make your own Cup Noodle at the Cup Noodle museum! The only issue I had was the language barrier but the locals make the effort to communicate."
"Went here with a friend at night. This place is superb. So beautiful, bright, but so quiet and serene. This is one of the best landmark I ever visited in Japan. By around 8 pm only a few people can be seen around here."
"Shops, amusement park, boutiques near the marina, restaurants all make for a good weekend outing.  Recommend."
"The heart of Yokohama. Business offices, shops, restaurants, cafes... everything is there. Step up the tall buildings to have the best view of the huge harbour. You can also see Tokyo itself from the top floors of these skyscrapers."
"But mesmerizing day and night! This place is where you can walk, eat, shop and sightseeing in peace. Lovely to see artists around just relaxing. They also have amusement park and malls. Don't forget to check out their popular 100-300 yen stores! Good finds."
"Visited Minato Mirai (Yokohama) last year for a day trip and I fell in love with this place, so decided to stay here as a base for 5 nights. The overall stay was simply amazing. Christmas lights and decorations everywhere made the experience and ambiance wonderful!  Minato Mirai is basically a seaside urban area which was previously a shipyard many years ago. It's a beautiful place to visit.Recommended places to visit while you are here. The below are the places that I had visited.1. Landmark Tower - beautiful view of Minato Mirai and it's surroundings2. Cosmo World Ferris Wheel - you wont miss it and it looks beautiful at night.3. Yamashita Park - A beautiful place for a nice stroll to enjoy the sea breeze/view, next to Yokohama Chinatown and Motomachi Shopping Street.  (Motomachi-Chukagai Station)4. Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse - unique shops and restaurants. Again, looks beautiful at night.5. Yokohama Port Osanbashi  - Take a 20 mins walk from Minato Mirai Station here for a nice stroll and amazing view of Minato Mirai 21. Highly recommended!6. Loads of shopping malls - Queen's Square, The Landmark Plaza, The World Porters Mall, etc7. Cup Noodles Museum (for kids)8. Yokohama Chinatown - for Chinese food. (Motomachi-Chukagai Station)From Tokyo, just take a local train (35-45mins) to Yokohama station. From there, take the Minato Mirai Line to Minato Mirai station (5mins).  Have fun!If you think this review is useful, do click on the helpful button. Thank you"
"This site was so appointmenting.  This is supposed to be one of the main sites to see when you're in Yokohama, I thought a one star  was giving it too much. Don't bother going"
"Enjoyed the carnival atmosphere in Yokohama, a city that takes fun seriously. Surrounded by the Tokyo Bay, it includes the Pacifico convention centre, a few hotels Like intercontinental, Tokyo Bay hotel , marine parks , a few malls plus the Cosmo World amusement park. You can spend a day or two slowly exploring the carefree place and yet aware that the city is only a 3-4 minutes ride away by subway..."
"This is a dense entertainment area all within a couple minutes of walking from attraction to attraction.  You will find Cosmo World, an amusement park, and a bunch of shopping districts such as Queen's Square and Porters.  There is also the Cup Noodle museum right by Porters within a 3 minute walk.  Bring your camera and snap a picture at night!  The skyline is amazing.  Be warned it is very easy to spend most of your day in this single area, and that's not good especially if your vacation in Japan is only a couple days!"
Great place to go and get out of the heat. Has great restaurants and lots of coffee shops nice shops to have a look around.
We enjoy going to this area to relax and walk.  Pick up a cold drink at a convenience store and go to sit on a bench. If it is not cloudy the sunsets are great. If you are chronic shopper there are so many places to spend your money.  The whole are is wonderful.
Looks like fairy land just on dark with all lights twinkling. Saw the elusive Mt Fuji in the other direction
"Yokohama has done such a nice job with this area - Landmark Tower and Queens Square are so fun to walk around.  Go at night with the lights.  They have Bay Cycle, too where you can get bikes for free and ride around.  Very, very enjoyable walking around and catching dinner with a plethora of choices."
"For ¥700 you can catch the view of the whole Yokohama bay! The staffs would get a picture of you at the base of the ferris wheel as a momento (you have to pay for the photo, can't remember how much). Recommended for couples and families and don't forget to bring your camera along."
"Out hotel at minatomirai area. Comfort place and very entertaining. Near cosmo world, red brick, landmark tower. Trying to walking around at night, ohhhh my fav for healing place"
Just strolling around in this area . Walking distance to the main attraction in yokohama . 2 stations away from yokohama station.
