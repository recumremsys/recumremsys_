"Good holiday ,great ski area with mix of high open areas and many tree lined runs.Altitude  gives snow sure conditions. Italian food is great  .uncrowded  pistes  with no lift queues. Links to other villages always open. Went back five times over the years and never disappointed. Will be back in a few years."
"Liked the amount of varied skiing that was available but the slow 2 man chair link to Sestriere needs improving. Very good for intermediates, not particularly good for beginners or advanced skiers"
"Reasonable local ski area and the linked resorts for full area, BUT the linking between them can be a bit of a problem - especially if high winds close lifts. One might be limited to Sauze D'Oulx ski area only. Lift system is a bit slow / old in places."
"Varied skiing with lovely through the trees runs. Wonderful views, great mountain restaurants at reasonable prices. 2EU for a coffee, take that France!"
Stayed in Sestriere- great little hotel Il Fraitevino.  the slopes are okay considering the snow conditions but the lifts are outdated and seem to shut at the slightest excuse so you can get stuck. the signage is poor compared to france and N. America. I liked the restaurants on the slopes but they are very busy and we queued 45 mins for self service.Went to Montgenevre  by taxi one day and that was lovely- far more open terrain and better lifts. Not sure I'd go again unless they seriously improve on the lifts.
"Advertised as large ski area but reality is the links between areas are incredibly poor ... we stayed in Sauze d’Oulx in great family run hotel Gran Baita as part of a Crystal Holiday. We arrived when they hadn’t had snow for weeks so unfortunately snow conditions were poor, though it did snow mid-way through holiday which helped. We could understand some lifts/runs being closed due to lack of snow but couldn’t understand why some higher lifts/tows e.g. high button tows in Sestriere we’re closed. We also accepted that blue/red runs back into Sauze were closed due to a fatality earlier in the season, 9 yr old child fell into ski fence/barrier. We were ok as we competent to ski the blacks but the run closures caused issues for lots of skiers in the resort. We Must frustrating thing was the fact link lifts out of Sauze were closed on 3 of our 6 days there ... closed due to ‘high winds’. 2 old slow chairlifts connect out of Sauze and if they need to close at the slightest breeze they need to invest in better more stable chairlifts or gondolas. Felt paying for full Vialattea lift pass when you can only ski the limited Sauze area for 3 of your 6 days was a rip off. On the plus side lots of nice restaurant and bars on slopes in Sauze that are very reasonably priced. Skied Sestriere one day (busier slopes, icy conditions, limited lifts open). Skied Claviere area one day ... bit of a trip to get there with gondola down from sansicario then 2 access chairs up to runs, but the snow was better and the pistes quiet. Best day was in Montgenèvre... pistes better, lifts bit faster and more runs open. We got bus there & back with Crystal so didn’t have the stress of link lifts potentially closing. Overall nice to ski somewhere new but I wouldn’t go back to area until the lift systems were upgraded. It’ll be back to the more expensive Trois Vallees for us next year ... faster better lifts, larger area that is actually well connected with far less chance of being stuck to one area."
I have now skied in Austria france and now Italy and I love this area. great variety of runs and as a good intermediate who loves a challenge this gave me everything. Skied one day in montgenevre and this tested me to the max on the extremely steep blacks tetras in particular probably the scariest I have done
Great place for intermediate skiing. Lovely mountain restaurants with freshly cooked food reasonably priced. Loved Sestriere. Didnt make it to Mongenevre but will definetely make it next time.
"Sestriere has a lot of accommodation so a lot of visitors, but it has not enough lifts. As a whole, Via Lattea's lifts are small, old and slow. Queue is a major problem everywhere, not just Sestriere. Since the lifts are old / low specification, they are very susceptible to closure. The lift company would not operate more lifts to alleviate queues, and the lift attendants do nothing to fill the lifts. As a result, pistes are quite empty but very long queues at lifts...everyday, not just Saturdays. The pistes were not groomed well. There were steps on the pistes, and golf ball size boulders. Some pistes were just not groomed at all. There was an extremely rude instructor who had a big beard wearing a golden jacket, who just pushed me when I was queuing. Then he came out with an excuse of I DID NOT SEE YOU. Disgusting behaviour. Overall, it was a very disappointing skiing experience in Via Lattea. I would not return to Via Lattea anytime soon. Note: if Via Lattea wants to know what modern fast and wind-tolerant lifts and good grooming look like, visit Ski Welt in Austria."
"Just back from an excellent week in Vialattea area. Loads of snow & sunshine with great skiing conditions. Stayed in Sauze & skied all the ares on the pass.Great variety of runs.If staying in Sauze, think about leaving your skis at a ski deposit near a lift as there is not much door to door skiing & a lot of uphill carrying with skis. The free shuttle bus seems unreliable.Lifts are basic, no heated seats! We were in the area on a quiet week & had no difficulty in skiing the whole area. Don't miss the mens & womens olympic runs in Sansicario & Sestriere.If possible get a bus to Mongenevre so that you can spend an entire day enjoying its great pistes.It is possible to get there from Sauze but you wont have a lot of skiing time there."
"Spent a week for New Year 2013 staying in Alpes de Relais hotel which was an excellent hotel with great staff. Resort was good crack people nice and bars,restaurants etc good value, however it was busy and we had to get a bus every morning to slopes. Bus service was attrocious with no queue system (every man/woman for themselves pushing to get on) then it broke down so we walked up to Coates lift and spent another 40 mins trying to get on a 4 man lift. It was infuriating watching every morning just one or two people at a time getting on lift, despite hundreds of people queuing (Italians are so patient & laidback, but it didnt make sense) I dont know why they dont insist on all seats being filled at peak times. We had good snow & slopes were good & plentiful but there were a lot of rocks on some slopes. I would say this is a fine resort in the low season, dont go for New year."
"Fabulous week skiing with group of 6 adults.  Loved the slopes although the piste map is the biggest waste of time we have ever seen.  My other half been skiing 42 years and he's convinced its the most out of date map he's ever read.  Be careful because you can end up on a run that's beyond your capability if its snowing and visibility is poor.Nice wide red runs that are well groomed, challenging in places, but nothing too intimidating.They didn't groom the black run at all, which for some would be more of a challenge, for others, a real pain if you want to just push yourself a little further.The bus service from our hotel was fantastic, but the local bus service was shocking.  Even the instructors were saying that they complain every year requiring additional services and nothing is done so lots of people late for ski school despite leaving hotel at 9am to get there for 10am.  The green line goes all the way up to Sportinia, but be aware, the bus with a 'green line' down the side is not the 'green line' its the blue line!!!!! you got to laugh, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.Provision of lockers and ski storage was a bit naff at the bottom of each of the lifts so not worth the hassle really.Lift passes are getting more expensive, the Italians seem to be catching on to what the French are doing increasing fees etc.  £155 lift pass, ski hire £79, £20 locker space (really just a pad lock on a wall).  Food up the mountain is costed well and you don't feel that you're being ripped off which is nice."
"Nice villages with good food and nice staff. Really good off-pist skiing in the forests. However, the ski system is disaster. The system under dimensioned for the number of people in the area. Haven’t seen such old lifts in ages. Super unfriendly and rude staff. Closes down the system if winds just above average. Don't know if it's because the lifts are so old or if the staff want's to go home early. We will not return."
"Have visited this ski resort 4times now and I miss it every time  leave. Not the best skier, but travel with some brilliant skiers and they have plenty great adventures on these slopes. There is something for everyone and it's all set in stunning scenery. There are plenty of pit stops along the way with Sportinia having a great selection mid station. Can't wait to come back."
"First time in sauze, snow was great considering it was first week in April! But to have quite a few lifts closed when there was snow on the pistes I don't get. I paid for a full lift pass I couldn't use! It was to save money, but the only people to suffer were the bars and restaurants, we couldn't get to.I also didn't think the pistes were bashed properly! Great big grooves in the pistes! They started to bash pistes as the week went on and opened runs up on our last day, for the locals I think!The area is large, we got to sestriere easily, but again lifts weren't all open!There is a desperate need for investments  in the lift service! No gondola except from the top down To sestriere! Long chair lifts uncovered or long drag lifts!Getting on the first lift up is awful, icy with mud! Getting off the lift is dangerous!This place could be so much more, but they need to spend money! The town is great with nice bars and restaurants! The bus service to and from the pistes, needs to be updated! Why not add the cost of the bus onto the lift pass! Everybody was complaining about having to pay for a service which is always included wherever else I've skied! If u r going to charge make it a frequent service! Again I believe it is charged to help pay for a new lift. Even Italians I spoke to agree there needs to be investment to develop and bring people in!I would go here again as I know what I'mGetting, but I don't know how it would be in colder weather travelling on those lifts!"
"Skied 'The Milky Way' and enjoyed some great skiing.  A good variety of different pistes for different abilities, however I wasn't convinced the pistes were graded correctly!  skied a black run which was more like a blue!  and a few very narrow steep blue runs! The piste map doesn't always relate to the markings and piste numbers on the ground though beware!.  All in all though, there are some great runs, with a lot of variety.  A large bowl with lots of wide gentle slopes and some lovely long runs through the woods.  Lift system was generally very good even though some chairlifts are getting old and queues were almost non existant.  Area lift pass also includes one day's skiing in neighbouring France (Montgenevre),  There was a one day lift operator's strike (Italian side) whilst we were there, but we were still able to ski in Montgenevre, as the tour ooperator bussed us there for the day."
Great place to visit. Went for a ski holiday there and really enjoyed. Staff and locals are very helpful. Night life in Souze is nice as well
"Vialattea is a ski area consisting of several linked resorts all of good quality and ability. We struck it lucky this year arriving just after a good dump of snow so we had a great week, although more snow would have been beneficial when we left. There are good cafe's on the slopes and good bars in Sauze D'Oulx where we were based. Given the opportunity we would not hesitate to return."
"Ski trip 3/2/2013 group of friends and family age 20 to 50? A traditional ski village not a purpose built modern construction. Plenty of shops,bars and restaurents. It is on a hill so if staying nearer bottom of village it is a bit of a hike up to the Clotes lift especially if in ski boots carrying skis but not unreasonable if you are reasonably fit. However avoid this and get the bus! stay on till sportina lift and miss out clotes lift up. Ski back to village at end of clotes piste and walk back via bars. Recommend The village straight across from end of piste much bigger inside then looks from outside and the best free apres food anywhere. Gorgeous fresh pizza and snacks.  Also Paddys and The Grotto who give out fab pizza too. Italy is so much cheaper then France who give you nothing in the bars and the people are all so friendly. Ski area is large and good for intermediates. Quite a bit of off piste too if you are lucky and get fresh snow. The down side? the lift system is in serious need of updating. The 2 main lifts out of sauze are long cold and old. It was very cold while we were there and got no sun on the lifts and we were seriously cold by the time we got right to the top especially if you use the link to get over to the other areas. They kept stopping constantly and broke down altogether eventually 1 day. Fortunately we had already gone up but were stuck on it ages freezing. The long drag to get back over to Sauze was bitterly cold the day we used it and the snow cannons were on full blast so you got pebbledashed by them too. This needs replacing,i thought i had lost my fingers by the end. These lifts need updating with at least covers over. There is only 1 bubble link to Sestriere and this was shut 1 day also due to high wind. We were stuck there all afternoon. They did put buses on to get people back to own resorts but took over 3 hours to sort this out. Apparently they had been giving announcements out on the lifts warning of this but it had all been in Italien! so we and a couple of hundred others didnt know. This all sounds very bad but we had very cold temperatures -15 to 18 with wind chill one day,bitterly cold.Perhaps with warmer weather we may not have noticed this as much and would have a better opinion but they do need to spend money on the lifts they are not adequate especially at the weekend when the italiens came out to play the queues were awful. However, i did enjoy my ski here we had some fantastic nights out and i will go back to italy as it is so much cheaper than rip off France and the people are lovely and friendly."
"Most of the time majority of the litfs were closed beacuse of 'strong winds'. Lifts connecting to other resorts were shut down while there was no skibus which could take us to nearby Montgenèvre, which by the way was fully operational in the very same conditions. I fully get the safety argument, but lifts here are closed because of a mild breeze! 20km/h wind at the top and lifts are closed all over the mountain. That's just absurd. Cherry at the top - there is no refund policy for skipass, even when ALL chairlifts in the area got shut down. Not recommend if you travel by plane or a bus. You're taking a huge gamble for the litfs being closed. Take a car, then you might get away with driving to nearby french resort - Montgenèvre and save the day."
Stayed over new year which meant the ski lifts were very busy. The design of the resort means that there's a real bottleneck at lots of places as often there is only one lift out. This made for a lot of long queues. We were in Sauze d'oulx which was easy to connect to some of the resorts but frankly getting to France and back is a real faff. There's quite a few times you need to take skis off and hike. The lifts are a bit old in places and this exacerbates the queues and they badly need a singles queue because often chairs are half empty as people trying to stay with groups. Pistes are all very groomed which makes for super easy blacks and reds which was very enjoyable. I would say when snow is sparse is more of a skiers resort than boarders as there's a lot of paths although expert boarders may have no problems.
If you are going over the kids holidays be prepared for massive queues for all the chairlifts! It’s actually ridiculous how long we waited to get up to Sportinia and then up again - 45 minutes was the average wait time. Having skied in both France and Austria these were some of the worse wait times I have ever experienced. The area is not designed for beginners and the lack of snow meant the lower slopes were getting very thin and icy. Would not consider going back again unless it was outside school holidays
"First time skiing in Italy and I was impressed!  Loved the Italian ski gear - they put the Brits to shame with their gorgeous stylish clothes.  Most of the Italians were also wearing helmets but a fair amount weren't so I think it is up to you to decide.Having skied a lot in Europe I felt this was a good resort for groups of mixed ability.  Two of the group had excellent private lessons (he turned out to be a trainer for the Italian Paralympic ski team) and they progressed massively with five hours tuition, allowing us to ski together on day two.  Yes there is loads to ski on although I felt the grading was a bit erratic.  Watch out for the ""blue"" going over to Sestriere under the cable car, as it becomes really steep in one section and scared the learners so much they wouldn't ski it again. My ""intermediate"" son had a near miss as he fell on the same run the next day and landed up near a steep edge overlooking rocks as no piste bashing had been carried out.  The best for early intermediates are the runs back to Sportinia.  When we were there (first week in January) the conditions were good although I didn't ski right back to Sauze as the last section of the slope remained really icy all week.The newest chairlift wasn't operating when we were there, so we couldn't do a big chunk of the ski runs.  Watch out for lifts closing, as other guests in our hotel got caught out and came back in the dark having mis-timed the distance they'd travelled.  We didn't find the rest of the lifts a problem and the queues were usually fairly short.There was no sign of grotty toilets so perhaps they've all been upgraded.  The restaurants and eateries were really good value compared to France.  Our favourite was the one at the top  by the cable car as they had good food and the best coffee in Sauze.  We took the cable car down to Sestriere and thought it looked too modern and boxy compared to Sauze which is more authentic.  Would go again to this resort, and see the feedback on the lovely Hotel Grand Besson!"
Translated simply as the milky way.  Perfect for beginers and intermediates and the ski pass allows you to ski in montgenerve or sestriere also.
"Lots to do and see for skiers and riders of all abilities.The ProsAffordable ski passHuge linked areaChoice of terrainFast, open, GS or carving opportunities abundantThe ConsVery slow lifts in many of the areasUnreliable ski bus in SauzeCrowds at peek timesLimited return to base options can result in congestionThis is a wonderful ski area and very convenient to Turin Airport.  The grading of the runs is suspect and will flatter those  intermediates who want to try more black runs.  I'd rate most runs as blue or red.  There is plenty of opportunity to ski off piste either between runs or via trekking.  The ski park is limited however it offered those that were using it a fun filled day to practice their tricks.  The lift system is a mixture of old and new.  That said many of the lifts across all the resorts were running painfully slow.  The ski map hasn't changed much over the years and on slope signage could be easily improved to aid the route planning and transit between resort.Well worth a visit for all levels.

"A fantastic place to ski. We started in Sestriere, skied there and Saux d'ould extensively and also went on a day trip to Montgenevre. Had to get a bus back to Pragelato (pre planned) as we travelled so far it would have been difficult to get back in time. Wonderful skiing everywhere"
"Great budget ski option love the place, for all you moaners get over yourselves.  It's not the high end resorts of France but it's not trying to be either.   Get yourselves to Italy :)"
Large area with a wide variety of slopes. Especially many red slopes. varying from open meadow high up to slopes through the forrest; from very wide to small and curved. Some long slopes; like the Olympica (black). Most chair elevators; some disc elevators. Not crowded (week of Feb 16 2014)
They promote the biggest ski area in Europe and then regularly close the only lift that connects Sauze to this area. Don't go here unless you want to be bored after the first day.
"Skied this over the new year period based in Sestriere- but used Gondola to access Suaz and other connected areas.Some of the piste maps are mis leading and if your not at least an intermediate, and on your own, you can expect a blue run but end up on a steep red!Saying that plenty red runs were so wide and pisted that they were effectivley blues, and easy to ski- even some blacks were no more than a steep red in other countries!saw quite a few accidents, with air helecopter arriving quickly to take unfortunate individuals away to hospital-Mountain resturants I thought were better than the food in resort and cheaper too- tip- arrive for your lunch before 12 or after 2pm to avoid ski school ques!also quite often no english signs etc telling you what to do- you order food and drinks at one counter and collect at another when your number is read out (IN ITALIAN- SO SHOW YOUR NUMBERED RECEIPT SO THEY CAN IDENTIFY YOU!)Unless you speak Italian of course!Talking about ques!- Is it only the English that do this! saw a few heated arguments with the locals all fighting in ques for lifts which can be long!. This was the only negative about the whole ski area- there was no order to queing, and a free for all!That aside- great skiing in a vast area- loved it!"
"We had good snow and some sun, so perfect conditions.  Stayed in Sauze d'Oulx and found it a good base for local skiing and also take the lifts and ski into Sestriere and Sansicario.  Lots of runs and good reds for intermediate skiers."
"Enjoyed the whole area, excellent runs and good conditions. Based in Sauze D'oulx but ventured out to the other resort areas using our ski passes was a great way to explore the area. Good prices for food and a great array of pasta dishes to keep you going!!! Stunning views from the runs as well. Will be back !!!"
"Great ski area.  Stayed at Jovenceaux and didn't even make it as far as Sestriere, there's so much to ski!  If you want to ski to Montgenevre, you need to either be able to do it flat out all day, or get a us."
"The Via Lattea, or if you prefer the Milky Way, is a vast ski area with lots of terrain to explore. Basing ourselves in Sauze d’Oulx it was a great area to ski as much as we could. Visiting in January the snow conditions were great although the weather was cold, so make sure to where plenty of layers. The resort has plenty of snowmaking facilities which were running almost 24/7 on the lower slopes and resort runs in Sauze D’Oulx. A few runs and lifts had not been opened and some runs became a little icy but nothing that an intermediate skier wouldn’t be able to handle. The resorts of Sauze d’Oulx, Sestriere, Sansicario, Calviere and Montgenevre offer a truly ‘Olympic’ amount of runs and are all well linked and it is easy to explore the piste’s of all the resorts. I would describe it as a resort to suit intermediate skiers with some of the runs a few unusually graded. A few slow lifts and drags remain which will be noticeable if you have visited some of the more well known resorts. However the ski area can only improve with more people visiting this wonderful intermediate resort. In Sauze try Red 11 onto Red 29 to 2000 and finish with Blue 52 into resort, in Sestriere the Black World Cup Kandhar piste is a must try for any advanced skiers and in Sansicario the Olympic piste is a great run down."
"Great skiing  in the trees above Sauze d'Oulx, extending to Sestriere and as far as France! Weather usually good, at least for us. Enjoyed it so much we bought an apartment in Sauze!"
