"Yalong bay, a beach with the highest number of 5 stars hotel in the world. So good for swimming as the current is not strong. Water is very clear , but cold even in the afternoon. It will be good to get your inflatables and float lazily in the water without a care in the world.Don't worry, You can enjoy the beach for free even if you do not stay in any of the 5 stars hotel.You just don't get to use the hotel facilities and beach towels that's all. Bring your own !"
This is probably the best of the beaches available in the Sanya area. Considerably cleaner and more attractive than Dadonghai or the main Sanya Bay. Wasn't too crowded when I visited. Downside is that it's a considerable trek from the city centre.
"Yalong Bay, something every Hainan tourist must sample. Roaring waves, beautiful sandy beach, immaculate. Everything you look for in a beach. Lacking in restaurants though."
Dadonghai is the relax beach. Yalong Bay is the fun beach. Not as long as others and always crowded.  But it's fun. Known for its water activities.  Water sports and boat trips can be done. Scuba diving etc. I went on a boat excursion and underwater boat trip.  Easily accessible by bus. Many nice hotels to look at. Food options are minimal.  Toilets are minimal.  And sun loungers are minimal.Water is very clear and beautiful.  I went here many times
"Compared to, Sanya and Dadonghai bay , this beach is much beautiful  but is also a bit expensive compared to the other two. There are  various water activities. Renting a hut (umbrella and two beach chairs) cost about  CNY  100 for a whole day. Renting tubes and other stuff is bit expensive.There are limited food stalls and the price is also high so better bring your own food and drinks. The beach was crowded although it was off season."
"This is best beach in Sanya. It is much cleaner than the beaches closer to Sanya city centre (e.g. Sanya bay). It is good for swimming and it does also fit younger children. Currents are usually not strong. Waves are usually rather small. Most hotels do cordon off the swimming area, so swimming in sea is pretty safe. Sand quality is pretty good. Beach is also over 7 kilometers long. Fits for jogging as we'll. Hotels offer their own water sports activities. This review focuses in beach itself. Yalong Bay Area has plenty of good hotels and it does also offer some decent restaurants (still the best destination in Sanya for your overall stay)."
Yalong bay is the more expensive part of the island. The hotels are generally over priced. On the beach you will pay massive over price for activities. Beach is nice warm water and clean. 75 rmb into city in taxi. Get bus lot cheaper.
"That is the best beach I have seen in China so far. The sand looks white and the sea looks clear. Comparing to other beaches in China or even in Sanya, this one is what a beach should look like and it has all best hotels around it. Many acitivities to do as well. Very good for short holidays (You may feel boring after 4,5 days), families with kids or honeymoon trip alike. Drinks and food are very expensive. Most hotels around provide free bottled water though."
"Stayed right by Yalong bay. Was a great beach for swimming and was quite flat and good for games like soccer or frisbee and theres even a volleyball net. They also have a variety of water sports available. There are a few shops, bars etc that are dotted along the bay and you can get fresh coconuts which is great. There are lots of families and generally lots of people. It can be quite busy at times and so there can be lots of tourists. If your into quiet romantic beaches it may not be the spot for you."
"One of the more pretigious beach area in Sanya. Open to public but the crowd is much better than being in Dadoing Bay area. Line of of hotels are mostly from international hotel chains. Lots of water activities for young and old alike. The Tourist Board should have more people policing the beach and fine locals who litter the beach with cigarette butts, plastic bottles, cans and plastic bags."
"Went here while staying in Sanya, a great beach with lots of international branded hotels.  There are various water activities and the visibility is much better than Sanaya Bay."
"This is a very pleasant beach surrounded by Five Star Hotels. Plenty of Aqua Activities..Jet Skis, Hobie Catamarans etc and great white sand with very warm climes. Sunbathe on the beach then take lunch in one of the adjoining hotels."
"One of the nicest beaches that we have been too.  The beach was clean and not crowded.  The sand was soft with a few shells, but no rocks.  The water was warm with a few gentle waves.The beach area is ringed by 5-star hotels so there is very little else to do or buy.  Given the nature of the hotels, food and drinks are expensive."
"Our friends had recommended us Yalong bay beach, so we had to see it. It was a beautiful beach. Compared to Sanya beach there were also some bars, water sports  and more people in the beach. However, it was just a beach with a view."
"Filled with resorts, the area is good to see another beach in Sanya. Not too far from downtown (24 km), accessible through buses. Prices are a bit pumped up but there are places such as mc donald's and kfc who offer still decent prices."
"If you want relaxing holidays far from city with nice beach - Yalong bay is right choice. A lot of hotels - Marriott, Hilton, Ritz-Carlton, MGM and etc are here. Make sure hotel has access to the beach and it is not too old. Many hotels built here 10 years ago and recently renovated. Have many restaurants as well. Around 1 hour from airport."
"Very beautiful beach. It is a white sand beach. There was a Direct access to the beach from My hotel. Being non peak season, The beach was less crowded. Worth to be there to see the Sun rise from the top of the mountain."
"Beautiful wide beach with warm clear waters. The natural landscape around the bay is nice, but nothing spectacular like some of the beaches in Hawaii or Thailand. If that's what you're expecting, you'll be disappointed. But if you're just looking for a nice beach, as I was, you'll love Yalong Bay. The beach is long enough that everyone can spread out, so you never feel like you're packed too close to other people. Watch out for the lifeguards -- they seem lazy and have terrible attitudes. When we were there, a piece of driftwood bamboo floated ashore and cut my friend's leg. The lifeguards were entirely apathetic and useless, offering nothing but a ""you took the risk of getting in the water"". They didn't even get out of their seats to take the bamboo pole out of the water. The pole was too large for me to carry out of the water on my own. Who knows who else it did or will injure the next time it crashes ashore. Pathetic lifeguards, so make sure you stay safe."
"Halong Bay differs from Sanya Bay, the water is rougher and the waves a little higher. Situated on the southern shore of the island, it has a number of international branded hotels and resorts access to amazing local food and if you want to shop, they have as well."
"A drive to Yalong Bay is highly recommended if you visiting Sanya. Drive up the hill for a lovely view of the sea. There is a long stretch where all of the main resorts and 5 star hotels are located and there is also a shopping plaza located on this stretch. Went to the beach but it was quite crowded and the width of the sand was quite literally 10 feet, no more. There are water sports and activities available which are quite good and reasonably priced, though."
"Very nice beach. Area is lovely. Surrounding hills pittoresque. Lots of resorts to choose, but food is of ordinary quality and very expensive."
It has large and beautiful beaches. Go there on a sunny weekday ie without many people around. Nice sand and seawaves. Highly relaxing and enjoyable.
It was disappointing to be at this beautiful beach on an overcast day!  One of the prettiest areas by far!  Sand is white and clean!  Be sure to book one of the hotels on the beach to have access to a limited beach as far as public access goes!
"Beautiful beach, and clean. Fun water sports for a fair price. Went parasailing for RMB360 per person."
"Clear blue water, very clean. Walking on the sandy beach is must in the evening as the sun comes down."
very well protected and maintained . Advise: Dont go on chinese public holidays. Mostly big luxury hotels in the area.
"Clear water and clean beaches, no hoards of tourists, perfection. Loved it here. The hotels along the beach all have great bars and drinks, makes me really feel like Iâ€™ve stepped out of China and into a tropical paradise!"
Let me say straight away I had a most enjoyable holiday on Hainan Island however to say that Yalong Bay is China's number I beach destination does not say a lot a lot for the rest of the country's coastline.I felt totally let down by my visit.The place is nothing but a strip of (fine) sand boarded by a string of characterless modern hotels.The infrastructure is diabolical.The Shell Museum was an empty hulk looking ready for demolition and the building of yet another 20 storey hotel complex.The Butterfly Valley was boarded up and looked as though the last butterfly had packed it's bags years ago.The staff at the main booking area for the sea excursions were (untypically) unfriendly and spoke no English (not that I expect it always but this was the main tourist site in the bay)!When I eventually managed to inform them that I was interested in an advertised boat trip to view the coral beds they just shook their heads and said no!!The catering district was totally devoid of any atmosphere (very untypical for China).The holiday souvenir photographer on the beach seemed to be pestering young mainland females ... perhaps he wasn't Chinese as again this is very untypical.The shore line was not well kept.There were very few public WC'S .... what may you ask was good ... only the excellent and frequent bus service out of the place!Hainan Island tourist authorities if you are reading this you need to get your act together.Where has all the money gone from the building of all these big multinational hotels??Sorry but I can only award one star and that is for the bus service out.I really rate Trip Advisor but for once you have got your ratings completely wrong there are far better destinations on the Island!!
"Beautiful beach but is not well maintained by the authority.  Waved are big and beautiful.Too crowded if you fo to the open beach, unless u spend abit more to stay at an hotel with private beach."
We go on the beach for drive and water sports. Itâ€™s interesting. Recommend. Good place for long walk. White beach and clean sea. A lot of tourists but you have a lot of place for dinner).
"Fine sand and wide beach, at least a mile long. Nice facilities, plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas. Gets a little windy after 4 pm."
"Nice water for swimming and nice sand, if you are not in one of the big hotels there is nowhere to sit unless you have your own parasol and mats etc, we did get sunbeds under a tree but I think they belonged to a hotel. Bring packed lunch as there are no beach bars to go to for lunch or a drink like we are used to in Thailand, Vietnam etc. Nearby restaurants in shopping centre including Starbucks. It was OK for a few days after touring China. Didn't see any other Europeans."
"Nice bay, though is hard to get in for free. Amazing for summer because it is low season so if you can make it to the bay youll be able to enjoy it all for yourselves. Feel free to use the beds from the hotels, they wont say anythyng ;)"
You can relax totally here by strolling along the beaches and breathing the fresh air. Tasting the local dishes is a must on your stay.A variety of seafood and delicious tropical fruits.Sea is very clean.
Taking bay is what I imagine Honolulu was 30 years ago. With quite a lot of world class 5 star resorts in town and some excellent bars clubs and restaurants Iâ€™m quite confident that anyone who visits will enjoy it as much as I did
