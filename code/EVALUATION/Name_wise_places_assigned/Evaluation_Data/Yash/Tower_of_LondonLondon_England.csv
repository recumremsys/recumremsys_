"Enjoyed visiting the tower last year, it was fascinating learning more about the history and seeing the various exhibits and parts of the tower. Look forward to visiting it again in the future."
Fantastic place to visit and shame it was so quiet. Come on peeps come back and support this beautiful city
"Living only a couple of hours from London i is a crime how little I have seen of my countries capital, having spent a weekend here we had to choose one 'big' attraction to do and plumped for the Tower of London, I won't lie I was sceptical and at just under £50.00 for the two of us that was part of it.I couldn't have been more wrong as soon as we got in we jumped on the Yeoman Warders tour and yes it is rehearsed by the delivery is excellent the humour for everyone and our guide held the 40+ people in the palm of his hand.  A fantastic 45minutes or so and worth the admission alone.If you do the tour first you are then free to explore at your will, everything is presented excellently and there is so much to see that you can easily spend most of the day here if you take it leisurely.  The highlights are the Crown Jewels and The White Tower both of which are presented in a way that shows off their importance.This is a must see for anyone coming to London, especially if you just think there is going to be just a tower, there is so much more."
"Perfect time to visit as it’s so quiet at the moment! Felt very safe as plenty of space to distance from others. Was disappointed the Yeoman Warder tour wasn’t on but understandable given Covid and they were at least dotted around the grounds ready and very willing to answer all our questions ‘Spike’ was particularly informative and a great story teller! Such an interesting historical sight, delightful staff, stunning jewels and hilarious ravens! Would strongly recommend for all ages. Only negative would be the website should advise what is running due to Covid aftermath to avoid disappointment."
If you love history this is for you plus you get to see genuine Beef Eaters and the Crows of course. I found this a very enjoyable visit. See where Anne Boleyn spent  her last days . History on tap. Good value for money . Would definitely recommend as a good day out.
"Really disappointed, I don't think it should be open at present. I have been here before and had a great time. However at present more than half of the tower is closed. This should be made clear on the website before you book tickets. There's a one way system which lots of guests are not following; furthermore during the crown jewels section no one was following social distancing. The workers should be monitoring social distancing, we were standing back and allowing others to see the jewels then would step forward to look and yet others would be pushing in and leaning over us. Then to top it all off they make you exit via the shop to which they make you wear a mask to enter the shop and leave - bear in mind this is the only way out luckily we had masks. I must add the staff in the shop had no masks on. Reqlly disappointed and complete rip off of £25 per ticket. Don't go here at present - especially as hardly anything is open!"
Loved this part of trip. Beside the jewels (which are worth the price alone) the tower itself was was inspiring. Great wardens tour comes with it.
"Amazing place to visit, full of history and fascinating facts! Well worth a visit! Book ahead to avoid the queues"
"Very much enjoyed our trip to the Tower of London-our tour guide was very funny and had a lot of information to give us-he answered all our questions very well. Even though it was raining, it was a very enjoyable visit and lovely views over to the London Bridge. Great gift shop with a good range of stuff and a nice café to. Enjoyed the horse museum upstairs and also the walk around the walls."
"Visited during the pandemic and it was very quiet, very few people there. This made for a great day out, as we could take our time and really appreciate the beautiful historic buildings. Everywhere was very clean, some exhibits were off limits due to the potential of contamination, but this did not spoil our visit."
"I toured every aspect of this fascinating landmark in one day, guided by the extra purchase audio-guide and 2 Yeoman Warder personal tours of the Chapel and grounds.  The Yeoman Warders are retired British military who live on site with their families and have intimate knowledge of every aspect of the history of the Tower.  There are special events all year long which enhance the overall experience.  I found this experience to be a unique and not-to-be-missed part of the London experience.  I toured London for 14 days and consider The Tower of London to be the best event of this excellent trip. I highly recommend you plan to spend the entire day exploring this critical part of English history. Be sure to sign up for at least one Yeoman Warder guided tour. Entry into the Chapel is by guided tour only."
"Having watched the tv show, I wanted to see the Tower for myself. We had a wonderful time seeing and experiencing centuries of history for ourselves. We had a tour with Tower Warden Clive (he said to say his name was Phil if we didn’t enjoy it 😂) and despite him struggling with a cough, not Corvid-19 as he was keen to assure us; was loud, entertaining and knowledgable. Get well soon sir, and thank you for this morning. Well worth a visit."
Even the most boring museum can make all interesting by audio and visual effects. Waiting that solution. Can be better. In other hand in there are all historical interesting things.
"Took the family here and was very disappointed. We were looking forward to admiring some panoramic views from the towers viewing platform. This is not the Tower you might imagine, and there’s no viewing platform. I think this should be more clearly stated on their website. Nice gift shop though. Toilets need improving."
"A wonderful experience, in particular the tour of the Crown Jewels by Luis who was generous with his time and gave brilliant insight and history to each of the crowns and their diamonds. Thank you for making our day special."
"I loved the history that fairly oozes from this place. Lots of things to see and experience, you really need a whole day to explore it all. Grab lunch at the Hung, Drawn and Quartered when you're done, and a quick visit to All Hallows at the Tower after will round off the perfect day."
Definitely worth buying ticket on line to skip the queues. If you are visiting London I would thoroughly recommend a visit to the Tower of London. Founded. In 1066 this UNESCO world heritage site sits in the banks of the river Thames. The history surrounding it and played out within its walls cannot fail to interest adults and children alike. The Crown Jewels are also housed there - book ahead as there is always a queue. Great shop and lots of cafes in the area. It is a fantastic day out.
"Loved it, couldn’t recommend highly enough! Informative, interesting, fascinating place to explore, as well the surrounding area..Roman walls, etc etc."
"A great place to learn about the history of London. There is a lot to check out! The best was the crown jewels, the white tower, etc. Be sure to be a bit early to beat the crowds if you want to check out the crown jewels. It might take a couple hours to check every things out, so allow yourself enough time. Also, the white tower has a lot of stairs, so beware. It's good exercise though, lol. The cafe was great to rest or grab a bite. The food was a little bit expensive but tasty. I would highly recommend this place if you are curious about the history of London."
"For some reason we have never tried the Tower of London but seemed the best choice in the current climate.On a warm or hot sunny day this is a must. There are multiple towers to explore , all rich with fascinating royal history. Even with our young children , the content kept their interest throughout the tour.The Crown Jewels are a sight to behold and worth a visit on its own.There were no queues or crowds due to the pandemic which made the whole experience comfortable and we never felt rushed at any point.Furthermore we had the privilege of watching the guards changing as well as regular conversations with the Yeomans.At the moment I would thoroughly recommend a visit.Ps. Be aware of the ravens , they will take your food !There were a couple of food outlets around though for the reason above I would recommend doing this before or after your visit ( upon exit there are multiple cafes / coffee shops)."
"This is an interesting and educational site to visit. There is something for adults and children. Recommend arriving early and purchasing tickets online. If you want to see the crown jewels, GO THERE FIRST! The lines tend to be long. It is worth taking the free large group tour of the site, then I suggest exploring on your own. I loved the ravens!!"
"Have visited quite a few times over last 50 years and always find a new bit of information! This time wasn’t planned but nether the less very enjoyable. ( Corona virus put paid to Yorkshire visit!) Yeoman tours this time of year start every hour at half past the hour. Our Yeoman of the Guard Clive was on top form and be proud of your job we enjoyed your hour long talk. Already knew things about Tower and was pleasantly surprised to know a few more bits after Clive’s presentation. Didn’t do White Tower as did couple years ago and had changed then as a lot less armour in there think it’s gone to Leeds.Jewel House had altered their format and was much better for visitors to get excellent views. Do they hire that punch bowl out I wonder as you can get 144 bottles of wine in it! Lol perfect for a celebration bbq when this Corona Virus ceases!!!!Ravens were in form squawking around and flying in and out their pens. Visited Armouries Cafe loads of seats had tuna & cucumber sandwich which was a bit hard priced £3.95 tea was £2.20 and a scone with butter £2.20 was nice.Fusilier Museum,Torture Tower, Traitors Gate, Royal Mint worth a visit and spent around 4 hours there for just viewing those few things. So allow plenty of time if viewing everything. (Train ticket you can get buy 1 get 1 free still on offer. )"
A great afternoon. We entered around 1.30 & didn’t have to queue. There is plenty to look around including the White Tower & Crown Jewels. I had read online that there was a one way system but this wasn’t clear. There was a large queue for the jewels however this moved fairly quickly. Viewing the jewels you are stood on a conveyer belt so get just a brief look but it is well worth it. There are still some areas closed for example the cafe and the chapel but I still had a great day. Staff are all friendly & helpful. I particularly recommend visiting to anyone with an interest in history or photography as there are great opportunities for atmospheric photos. Loved it. Thank you.
"Lived in London for 25 years and never been so thought now would be a good time to visit.No queues! Saw crown jewels three times!Spent three hours there so £25 was worth it, just."
Lovely day out. Went during COVID so no queues. Quite expensive but worthwhile. Loved the Crown Jewels too.
Loved all the history and the freedom to walk around as you chose in this beautiful historical site. We went on a rainy day so the Beefeater tour was very short.  I think on a nicer day it would have been better. Beautiful!
"Having seen several reviews, and some advertising, saying how quiet the Tower of London was we decided to give it a try.The highlight of this visit of St Thomas’s Tower with the reconstruction of Edward I's bed-chamber – a wonderful room with fantastic views; just now sure how we missed this on our last visit!This was our second visit this year (meaning our “Historic Royal Palaces” family pass has already saved us money) – the last was in January and I can definitely say the Tower of London was busy than in January.  In January there were no queues to see the crown jewels, in August there was a long queue. The advantage of the HRP pass is that you don’t feel you have to see everything in one go (hence missing St Thomas’s tower on the previous visit) which then makes the whole visit a lot more relaxing.During lockdown there are no warden tours, so the Beefeaters were a lot more visible and easier to ask questions of.  In addition, the area next to the Thames was cordoned off and only accessible to those visiting the tower (a huge plus as this area is often packed with sightseers).  Outdoor catering and toilets are available. Not all of the Tower of London has re-opened, but still well worth a visit."
"Wonderful historical site with multiple buildings. Allow a minimum of 3 hours to explore but ideally longer if you can.  Crown Jewels are stunning, changing of the guard is fun to watch and looking at all of the different genres of uniforms was very interesting.  A great day out for the family, more suitable for older children to appreciate all on offer."
"Loved, loved, loved it! Our daughter has been desperate to go since watching ‘Gangster Granny’ Thoroughly enjoyed the experience"
I haven't been to the Tower for about 50 years and my partner has never been so we decided to include it on this trip.Really well organised and socially distanced with limited numbers. masks worn in all interior areas. Worked really well.
"Visited the first day they opened after lockdown, but sadly a few places within the site were still closed due to covid which was a shame. However, I would recommend the Tower if it's your first time visiting. It was my second time and not as worthwhile. The place felt a bit hollow. Hopefully things will pick up again long after covid."
Great visit to the Tower. Very friendly beefeaters and the Crown jewels were stunning. Shame some places were not open but still a great day.
Booked a timed entry which worked well.  The site has our marked out routes to get around while social distancing.  This is a good time to go as there was plenty of space to look round without any crowds at all.  The Tower is packed with history and has a fantastic atmosphere - you can feel the history coming from all sides.
Enjoyed a great half day at the Tower although I feel I should have planned on more time as there was so much to see. Great guided tour by Simon the Beefeater. He really brought history alive with his unique and humorous narratives. The Crown Jewels were breathtaking - so much gold!
This is a cool and obviously very historically significant structure. The Highlight for me was seeing the crown jewels because they are so dang impressive. Also enjoy the great view of Tower Bridge on your way out. Make sure to have someone with you who can explain all the historical significance.
