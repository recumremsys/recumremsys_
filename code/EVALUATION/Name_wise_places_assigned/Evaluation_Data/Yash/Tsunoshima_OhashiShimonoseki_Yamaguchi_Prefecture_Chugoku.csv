"I came from Shimonoseki station, hence it was a bit difficult in terms of transportation (JR train ride) and then bus to the nearest station to the bridge. Please check which station your are coming from. Coming from Shimonoseki station, you can either Kottoi station or Takibe station, then wait for the blue bus that will take you to the brigde (that is the entrance of Hotel Nishinnagato Resort, then walk about 2 minutes to the bridge to take picture. And I was lucky to go around the sunset hours, though the bus ride is almost the finale ride.For example, I took 13.44 ride with JR train from Shimonoseki station), arriving to Takibe station at 14.59, And then blue bus at 16.21 arriving at Hotel Nishinagato resort entrance at 16.53. And I had about 30 mins in total to take picture and enjoy sceneries there.And at 17.26 I was back at the bus stop, to go back to Kottoi station (you can also stop at Kottoi station and take a JR train ride to Takibe station-but please check the time table), arrived  at Takibe station took JR train from at the station at 18.22, arrived to Shimonoseki station at 19.31. But please take note that this blue bus actually does cross the bridge to go over to Tsunoshima island, but you must make sure you have enough time to walk and explore around, and please check the time table in advance. Bus services are not that frequent, and if you have 4 people, you may charter a taxi, the station master is able to help you. A single way taxi ride might cost JY5000."
"Although the bridge is a quick ride, it gives you a beautiful view on the ocean. There are a couple of islands that are on the horizon. These make for good pictures. But if you ask me, the main attraction is the island itself. Keep going and you won't be disappointed."
"We just happen to drive by the area and decided to cross the bridge. That was a great decision.  The sky had quick moving clouds, so the ocean changed its color from gray to blue in a few minutes we were around.  We could also see some fishing boats and fishermen busying themselves.  The beautiful clear water under the bridge was flowing from one side to the other in an amazingly fast speed.  Crossing the bridge is quick, but there is a small parking in the middle of the bridge as well as on the island side of the bride, where you can park your car safely and enjoy the view to your heart's content.  If you'd like to see the longer and more grand bridge project, your next destination is Okinawa Kaichu Doro!"
"Whilst it may seem out of the way, have no doubt the drive in itself is just as enjoyable as the bridge. With Motonosumi Inari Shrine only about half an hour away, along with a Roadside Station selling foods such as Yakitori, Grilled Squid, Takoyaki alongside standard souveniers and the region's local foods, you'd almost forget there was a bridge if the name wasn't printed everywhere.There is parking before and after the bridge for people to take photos, alongside vending machines (Duh it's Japan), and some shops selling ice-creams and drinks. The drive itself is amazing, with the island that it leads to being equally as amazing. The bridge itself is a lot longer than you think, maybe taking about 5 minutes to cross from start to finish with various slopes and mini islands being passed. Don't think I saw a single non-local tourist there, so if you want a unique experience, slightly off the beaten track, make sure you give this place a visit, especially the Roadside Station for food and gifts!"
