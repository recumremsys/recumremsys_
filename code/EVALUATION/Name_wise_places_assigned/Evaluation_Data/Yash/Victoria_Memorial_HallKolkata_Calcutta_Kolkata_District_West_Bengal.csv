The Victoria Memorial is a large beautiful marble building built between 1906 and 1921 during the British era. Has lustrous green garden around the building and a small part of the building has been opened up as a museum. Nice place for a picnic / family outing.
What a marvellous building to commemorate Queen Victoria.  Built between 1916 to 1920 it is a tribute to British design and architecture. A must place to visit although the entry fee is 30rupees for Indians but 500rupees for us foreigners. Racial discrimination that would not be tolerated in UK. Did not detract from my enjoyment at being there.
"Located in Kolkata, West Bengal. The Victoria Memorial is dedicated to queen Victoria and is a large white marble building. The building houses many galleries like the Royal gallery, Calcutta gallery with numerous portraits and exhibits.The memorial is located centrally in the city in the famous Maidan area and is also nearby Hooghly river. There is an entry fee to this place. Opening hours are from 10 A.M to 6 P.M except on national holidays and Monday's. A top tourist attraction in Kolkata with many historical offerings within."
"The Kolkata Victoria Memorial is one of the city's biggest landmarks. Built in the memory of Queen Victoria, this beautiful structure is a museum and a tourist attraction.The structure is constructed using a combination of British and Mughal architecture known as Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, an architectural style that was followed in British India in the late 19th century. It is one of the most famous tourist place of Kolkata."
"This Kolkata landmark, which is a memorial built for Queen Victoria, is a must visit. Set over 57 acres of garden (not all of it is open to the public), the marble memorial, with beautiful statues on all sides, really stands out. There are free hourly guided tours for the museum inside, where you might be pleasantly surprised by the Indian and Western paintings and memorabilia. The gardens are open to the public from 5.30 AM till 6 PM and the museum opens from 11 till 6."
"Victoria Memorial needs no introduction. Built during the British Raj, this museum is a must visit place in the City of Joy. The lush greeneries around the place and the adjacent Maidaan area is absolutely mesmerizing"
Place worth to visit. Monument of Self-importance and Loyalty to the Queen. Build by Indian for British.  Worth to stay couple of hours with a good camera. Tickets for foreigners are much much more than RS 20-30.
"Built in early nineteenth century in memory of Queen Victoria after her death is perhaps the most popular structure in Kolkata. The marble structure combines variety of architecture styles like Indian & British along with touch of Egyptian, Venetian & Mughal.  A tour of building is very educative as you get glimpses of British colonial ruled period.The white marble structure reflects city’s colonial past."
"This magnificent piece of architecture was built for Queen Victoria's visit to Calcutta, whist it was the Capital of British India. She stayed in it for one night only.No matter what your view on colonialism are (mine are definitely not in favour of!) a visit to this magnificent monument that is now a museum's a must. Its very much an active place - people use the gardens for morning runs and yoga and walks- and as such is just a tad grimy. Visit it anyway. You won't be disappointed."
What an amazing structure beautifully preserved. Built in memory of Queen Victoria. The clouds that visit this monument yearly have not detracted from its beauty. At all angles around the building you are presented with another amazing sight.
"Had a splendid experience walking around the monument and learning about it's construction, the British era and the history of India between 1700s and 1950. The monument is grand and surrounded by beautiful lakes with some amazing Flora and Fauna. We also spent some time through…"
Amazing museum displaying history of British Raj in India. I wish my school teacher had taken us here to teach history lessons! Make sure you get free tour guide. Guided tour is available every hour.
"Think of Kolkata, think of Victoria!!!It is a very famous historical monument of Kolkata. Word of caution - carry a water bottle as a long walk.."
"Calcutta and Victoria Memorial are synomous with each other. Having passed the monument umpteen times on my previous visits to Calcutta, being high on the tourist list, i decided to visit the Museum this time though with mixed feelings- ""A building made by the British for the British""- I asked myself do i really want to visit this instead of the Indian Museum?? I'm glad i went as it gave a better understanding of the history of Calcutta, the city of my birth-pictures and accompanying writeups were well detailed"
"The most iconic monument of Kolkata, Victoria Memorial is known for its immaculately maintained lawns and gardens which attract locals and tourists alike. Check out the rotating fairy on top of the dome."
One of the legacy of the British empire that is still a must see for any visitor to Kolkata. Imposing structure very good for Photo Ops.
"Since I live in Kolkata, I've visited the Victoria Memorial many times:with friends, family and also my journalism students, and each time was enjoyable and informative. In Kolkata, visiting the Victoria Memorial is a must-do outing. It's the best place to check our during the autumn - winter months (November - February). Check for the timings when it remains open from early morning till evening. Entry tickets are reasonably priced. It has lush open lawns and gardens to walk around, a museum and art gallery inside, replete with paintings, statues and memorabilia dating to British Colonial times. Victoria Memorial was constructed to commemorate Queen Victoria (1819–1901). Built of white marble, it holds iconic stature in Kolkata, West Bengal, and was built between 1906 and 1921. Some important legal documents are on display inside the gallery; for instance the one announcing the change in British India's capital from Calcutta to Delhi.  Thousands throng the premises in winter months and sit around the large water body that is surrounded by lush trees and plants. The large imposing statue of Queen Victoria in the front adds its own aura. At night, the entire marble structure becomes even more enticing when blue lighting adds an ethereal glow. Not just visitors, locals also enjoy the ambience and come in droves, with family and friends to spend some 'fun time' here."
"Kolkata city evokes some images – images of its icons - and the most promising ones among those of the two icons – Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge (leaving a plethora of them aside including those of the electric trams, rickshaw pullers and the famous puchkas).My childhood had been spent with umpteen visits to the Victoria Memorial – and in those days, my father was neither very busy nor very rich. And as he rose in the corporate ladder, the time started becoming scarce and visits also reduced. But every visit was brilliant for the very long walks in the exquisite gardens of the Memorial – which was followed by some great street food in the Maidan right opposite the gates of the memorial. The most famous among them was the Dal Vada (that had moved to Vardaan Market – see its review), chana jor garam, Bhel Puri, Batata Puri, Puchkas and the Churmurs. Now every delicacy had a place in Kolkata where it was served right – not very simple anymore! Those were days of innocence – and days without gadgets or mobiles – and days with hardly any needs worries or distractions. And hence numerous visits to the Memorial. But never did I remember entering the main precincts of the building – it was out of reach. And now almost three decades later, I was here at the famous icon of the Kolkata – back for good.A small crowd had thronged near the entrance gate. There were tickets only for the lawns and extra for the main Hall. For foreigners, the rates were significantly higher (Rs 30 vs Rs 500). After a wait of about 10 minutes or so, we entered the Memorial. The main lawns were magnificent and decked in myriad hues and colours. The cobbled stone walkways were as we had left – though the stone count seem to have been diminished and parts of walkways were broken. There was plastic ban in the compound – which was good thing. May be it is expected that a nationwide ban on single use plastic is coming soon – good riddance of a catastrophic human blunder. Apart from lawns, there were small lakes in the grounds that provided excellent setting for this masterpiece.Inside the main hall, there was huge crowd that had built up – to see numerous exhibits on displays – there were holy books, old armoury, communication equipment, paintings, canons and what not. I had just been to the National Museum in London and this memorial administration could surely learn few tricks of trade. There was significant scope of improvement in how things should be displayed or how a museum should have been managed. There were places where the paint was peeling – or the AC cables had made a mess of the venue (built at a time when AC possibly did not exist) – or birds that freely flew inside the main hall – or dustbins that were just not clean enough. Built between 1906 and 1921, the century old icon of Kolkata was classic case of elusive Utopia at an architectural masterpiece – niggles here and there and here and there."
The beauty of this place still shines. Hope the indian government can preserve it in future. Require more systematic arrangements and nice lights.
"One of the most iconic symbols of Kolkata.It has a rich history associated with it and there is a museum inside. The gardens are very well maintained. And if you are interested is Morning walks or a breath of fresh air amidst the concrete jungle, then this would fit in perfectly. The lawns are spacious and there is enough space for young kids to run around.The place is equally mesmerizing when the lights are switched on in the evening. Finding a parking spot for your vehicle might be problematic as most of the roads around it has ""no parking"".The angel statue on top is supposed to whistle if there is a storm brewing, but I am not aware of anyone who has heard it personally.All in all, a nice place for an outing. And a must see if you are visiting Kolkata."
This is the highlight of Kolkata. Interesting museum with amazing architecture. Reminds one of the Taj Mahal. Beautiful gardens. Need at least half a day to a day to visit and take it all in. Situated in a lovely green area of Kolkata too.
"This is something else again. A time machine that takes one back to the years before the First World War although only built in 1921. It is a tribute to its eponymous dedicatee. Extracted nay blackmailed into contributing, India was generous in its tribute to her. The building is instartlingly white Indian marble. Ornate and rather elegant. Once past the bronze of Victoria Emperatrix , one steps into a vast echoing hall surmounted by a galleried cupola. The first sight is a beautiful statue of the young queen. The ground floor is full of loot, portraits of the dignitaries of Victoria’s India, watercolours by her sailors, cannon, a wonderful black marble table mounted on four bronze howitzers, weapons of the period of British rule.Upstairs I found an exquisite exhibition of Indian miniatures that took me a full hour to see properly."
"Historical place in kolkata, India. We enjoyed with our family. Good place for tourists and all. Thank you."
Lovely gardens and interesting displays inside.  Interesting and even-handed history of Calcutta/Kolkata. Make sure you go up and circle the dome looking down on the statue of Queen Victoria.
One of the most famous place in Kolkata- the coty of Joy.  Had a wonderful time with its beauty though I am not expert in architectural things. Would love to be here again.
Revisiting this place brought back memories from my childhood when during Christmas holidays we would visit Kolkata n this place. Has a lovely garden . Beautifully done up decor. Although very crowded....but every tourist place is so. Favorite family outing during winters. Great for picnics
"It is a historical monument. A day is not enough for a student or admirer of history to see it. Take a small notebook and make notes. Weekdays should be ideal if you want to see it leisurely. Please don't use cameras inside, be responsible"
"Truly an amazing collection of India’s glorious past. Loved the free guided tour , the tour guide Mr. Raghu Nandan Biswas gave a great overview  on the artefacts and the historic details . If you are visiting Kolkata anytime and are interested in knowing about our glorious colonial and medieval era history , this is the place to be ."
"located at the heart of central Kolkata, this is a must visit place. all places including esplanade, national museum, birla planetarium, maidan and alipore zoo are very close to victoria memorial. please go with your own water bottle and plenty of time in hand. surrounded by very beautiful parks, this is a place best visited after 4 pm."

"So I was born and brought up in Calcutta and perhaps crossed this enchanting monument twice everyday of my school life when I was not on a holiday. I remember peeping out of the window to see the Fairy on top of the domw twirl just once! But, Alas!I went back now, almost 25 years out of school, this time vowing to myself I would go into the monument to see what I had missed!And I did not repent it one bit! Its a wonder! An architectural marvel and a work of outstanding geometric precision. It is an exemplary expression of Vistorian artistry, not to be missed for anything on this earth and in the city!However, my two bits of advice would be- read about the place before you go! Do not expect a guide beacuse we found none! If you are aware of what you are walking into the delight would be deeper and more heartfelt!"
"It's a lovely place to visit and specially when the weather is pleasant and the clouds are clear. Established in 1921, Victoria Memorial Hall was dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria"
Visiting KOLKATA and not going to Victoria memorial is simply unbelievable and unthinkable.  It is one of the most sought place to visit in KOLKATA.  It is an icon of KOLKATA
One of the must see places. Built during British regime. Historic monument. Lots of things to see inside the museum. Also surrounded by a very good park.
"Visiting this museum with a local friend was very nice, as it showed me some of the vast history of the city, but also overwhelming. There are few rooms with air conditioning, so it was mostly hot and humid as we wandered the halls. It is a good-sized museum, with much to see, so be prepared to walk and stand a lot. Warning to foreigners (especially blond women): some locals will want to take photos with you."
