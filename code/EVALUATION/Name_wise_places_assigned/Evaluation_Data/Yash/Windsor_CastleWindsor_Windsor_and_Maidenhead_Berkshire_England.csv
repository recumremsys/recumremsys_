"I think anyone can appreciate Windsor castle. Beautiful place, the grounds, and staff were immaculately presented. Make sure you get there early to queue, even if pre paid as that takes time. Long wait and security style search. Once in, it’s easy to follow, but I strongly recommend going to the chapel for 09:30-10:00 for the change of guard!!Down sides are, no parking there, but car parks are close by, however these are £15+ for 5 hour. Pay the £18 for day and visit windsor the town as well. Wish we had visited the week before Christmas as the feel was very Christmassy."
"Lovely visit to the castle.  Very hot on being Covid secure.  Lots of wonderful artefacts and architecture to admire.  Enjoyed a delicious cake from the cafe too.  Vast majority of the staff were fantastic - one was an idiot and unkind to a small child who forgot not to be touching things, the member of staff could have been much kinder about in dealing with this."
"Having seen the castle on the tv and after the royal wedding Windsor was a must visit for me! Was not disappointed, climbed to the top of the round tower and could not believe the views! A trip to the Queens farm shop is a must for any foodie."
"Despite being concerned over post lockdown restrictions, today’s visit to Windsor Castle was very good. Well organised and lots to see, the headsets were very informative and staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. Reduced number of tourists actually made for a better experience."
"Wonderful visit here today. What a fabulous place! We looked round some of grounds first, visited The Dolls House( a huge ‘dolls house’  built to show-case different skills available in England,  everything is on a smaller scale and works! ). St. George’s Chapel was wonderful but there was a lot going on here today, the Organ was being serviced and all the pews were upside down, so it was a bit of a mess but still worth a look. We saw where Henry Vlll was interred.The State Apartments are really worth a visit, take your time and walk around them. Make sure you get the Audio-Guide, it explains everything for you. Each room was amazing and must take a lot of up-keep.So many precious items/curtain hangings/ flock wall-paper/furniture to look at. Amazing and wonderful. We also saw the Changing of The Guard. If you get the chance you should definitely visit when this takes place(Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 11 a.m.  It is a fantastic spectacle.We had a fab time"
Was here as part of my booked day trip! Castle was amazing! No photography allowed in the rooms. The dining room look so interesting! Accessible by train i think. Worth coming here. The mushroom melts sandwich at EAT shop was so good. One of the places u must go if you r in London!
"Being mega obsessed with the royals this trip to Windsor Castle did not disappoint. The Castle is kept in immaculate condition and everything you can see is outstanding. An added touch (which I didn’t realise) was that you have a interactive tour for the price of your ticket so an explanation of every room/place you go in is in your ears as you poodle along. We were very lucky to see Guards marching along too, we had a great time and will return in years to come!"
Took a bus on a day tour to Windsor Castle. Very nice visit to see the State Apartments where you send many luxuriously decorated rooms to receive royal or government dignitaries by the Queen.
"Positives - Castle grounds were spotlessly clean and immaculately presented. Audio guide was good and we managed to follow it and I’m not very good with these things so if I can follow it anyone can. Staff friendly and very knowledgeable and plenty of them around. Negatives - so many artefacts to see but no labels or descriptions of what your looking at. And the audio guide doesn’t have it all. Queuing for the loos didn’t seem to be many. Limited access, you only see abit of the castle, not even half I’d say so quite expensive for what you get. It was Sunday so chapel wasn’t open. Tip- Don’t park in the NCP we got charged £20 for parking for the day. Worth a visit but an expensive day out."
Loved Windsor and the castle. The audio aids brought the experience to life. Entrance fee very reasonable.
Loved exploring the castle. Highlight for me was the dolls house - fascinating!!! I would highly recommend booking ahead as we were able to walk straight past some very long queues!!!
Visited Windsor Castle for a business trip. What a lovely day for a visit. Every member of staff are so welcoming. Ticket brought in advance and got my ticket for a one year pass. Well worth it. Lucky to see the King's Royal Hussars changing of the guard. I would recommend for a first time visitor to Windsor Castle have a recorded guide tour. It will give you alot of history in each section. Then you should walk to long walk. I would recommend getting there early as its limited numbers at present. Worth a second visit.Thank you to all the staff.

Loved the tour of the castle just sorry we missed the dolls house but we now have a pass for a year so will definitely be returning to see that and the park.  St George's chapel surrounded by history and proud to have such amazing heritage.
Wow!! absolutely gorgeous!!Was amazed by the castle. So beautiful and well kept...the staff were all so lovely! Very welcoming. Answered all your questions with a smile. If they saw you looking and something and could tell you were curious about what it was. they would come up and tell you about it. Seriously recommend going. You won’t be disappointed.
"Spent a wonderful day Castle, the state rooms are magnificent and have to be seen to believed. The Chapel although smaller than I expected was beautiful. Thoroughly recommend a visit. If the weather is good then the Great Park is also a must."
Very interesting but not so exclusive as each group 30 people. Well organised and Guide ok    History of the castle and monarchy amazing.  Castle beautiful in the evening lights with good picture opportunities.  Watch the cobbles as wife twisted her knee on exit.  Would visit again as each visit an experience
"Just fabulous, all the history, but still a living palace with more history made every year. Visit off peak as it can be mad-busy."
"Having won afternoon tea we booked the castle visit as a way of making my wife’s birthday. Have to say we had a great time it’s well worth the visit, be sure to use the free audio tour as it explains all the history as you walk about. Ever helpful staff also made it a delight as they were on hand to answer questions. Only down side is being disabled with limited walking ability having to park at the bottom of the hill was a disaster for me, those who have disabled passengers are best off dropping them off and then parking up. Over all a delight of a day"
"Had a great time here. The staff were so informative and nice throughout. Top tips:Book earlyAsk the guards when the changing of the guard is taking place (think it's 12pm or so), it's cool to watchTake your time going around each section - the audio guides are brilliant"
"Yes, it is great to see but inside castle you can't take pictures.  No photography !  Plan ahead to view guard with band as schedule changes.  You can get pretty close to guard and take photo's.  Getting here can be difficult.............finally discovered Green Bus 702? from Victoria Collonade - really cheap and takes a couple of hours - local commuter bus with various bus stops."
"Chose a day with changing of the guard, was very chilly but worth it. The castle itself is well laid out for all visitors with a  bit for everyone. We went early spring during term time so it was relatively quiet can imagine it being really busy during holidays.Well worth the visit."
"Took my elderly mother to a visit to the castle. The staff were outstanding, helpful, understanding and very polite, nothing was too much trouble for them. Mother was in a wheelchair and we had to take different lifts to the various floors and exhibits. Everything was absolutely superb, would recommend to anyone and any age."
"Going to Windsor Castle is not cheap but definitely worth every penny! Castle is simply stunning, so much history here and you have a free device and headphones with tour guide this was super helpful and gave us SO much informations. And the best part is, the ticket is valid for year, so you can come back for free during that time. Awesome and nice place for a walk as well, I will go back to learn some more details. One tip - St Gorges Chapel is closed on Sundays! So if you're interested in that, go Mon-Sat. Cheers"
We hadnt planned the visit be decidex to visit whilst passing. Staff at the front enterance were so lovely and chatty staff on reception not so. It is quite costly to entrr especially if you have children it a larger family. Recommend reducing child prices to encourage more children to visit this little bit of history. The audio devices are a little difficult to work out would advice so.eone to explain especially for children. Once we worked ut out our 7yr old grandson enjoyed the family version. The castle is unbelievable such a pleasure to go round. We thouroughly enjoyed ut.Shops were a little too costly to purchase anything.
"Seeing the completed restoration of the rooms where the fired started, amazing craftmanship. Staff were courteous and very professional."
Loved seeing the castle!  Our Beefeater Tour Guide was GREAT and hilarious!  She made a tour of viewing old artifacts and history so entertaining and FUN!
"Really enjoyed a few hours wandering around.It was the weekend of the Royal wedding, (Michaels daughter) so we couldn’t access all areas of the castle but the parts we could see were very interesting and great for some good pics.My wife is royal mad so I booked a weekend trip to Windsor for her and we both agreed, this was one of the highlights!There was some fantastic architecture as well as amazing history.Tip. You can go to the church service in the chapel on Sunday morning, free of charge. It was amazing with full choir! Don’t miss it!"
"Great tour and worth every penny you spend. The palace opens the gates to the cathedral, personal spaces of past queens and kings and many of the personal rooms of the current queen. Everyone is very helpful and the docents are really well informed. Eat at Chippy’s at the entry to the palace!"
Took the family to visit the castle for the first time and spent over 4 hours there which flew by very quickly. Would recommend the virtual tour as the detail it provides is fascinating. A true piece of history and well worth a visit especially as you can get your ticket validated which allows you to return again within the next 12 months
So glad we made the trip to Windsor.  Easy cab ride of 40 mins and 45 pounds.  The town is so quaint.  The castle and church are full of history but even more so a working church and castle.  We were able to visit the state apartments.  The art work and artifacts from around the world are amazing.  The grounds are massive.  The church where Harry and Megan wed come to life when you stepInside.  We had a wonderful lunch in town and shipped.  Then a 15Min walk to Eton College.  Make sure you get tickets we got right inside.  Others waited 2hours.  Very cool.  A must see
My partner and I booked a lweekend end in Windsor so naturally visited the castle. Only a 10 -15 minute wait in queue for tickets. Airport like scanner to check our bags and walk through scanner for us. Had chance of getting headphone tour free of chance which was easy to follow throughout our visit and gave lots of history and information. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit!
Ate in the lower restaurant - French Village- lovely food. Chowder full of fish and seafood. Prawn open sandwich also delicious.
"Loved our visit to the Castle, definitely get the audio guide and take your time.  Our 10 year old daughter loved it as much as us, steeped in history and very well run."
Recently went to see The Windsor Castle. My husband and I thought it was so beautiful and interesting. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They was so much to see in there. Allow yourself plenty of time to see it all. The town of Windsor had some quaint little shops and we wish we would have allowed more time to see some of them. Next visit we definitely will be able to see it all.
"This was not my first time at Windsor castle because it was such a great place to visit.Tip #1: try to avoid visit on Sunday because you won’t be able to access to St George’s Chapel as it won’t be opened to the public visit.If you arrive later in the day, the queue would be shorter. I came in at 2 pm and there were only a few people in line.Tip#2: Save your admission ticket and as you exit, present to it to the people on the right side, they will ask you to sign at the back in front of them and gave you a stamp. You can then use that for another year.Plan to spend at least 2 hours there. Tip#3: no photography of any kind is allowed inside the castle.My favorite part was the Queen’s doll house. Don’t skip and Check it out. This place closed at 4:30 pm in the winter so plan accordingly. You can get a direct train from Waterloo station to Windsor Eaton and Riverside Station. Note as of December 2019, there are strikes going on with Southwestern Railway until Jan 2020. However, I didn’t have any issue with the train at all.I highly recommend this place if you want to take a break from busy London."
