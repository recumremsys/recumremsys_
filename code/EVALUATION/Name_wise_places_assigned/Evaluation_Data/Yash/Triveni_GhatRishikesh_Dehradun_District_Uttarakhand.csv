"Its a lovely beautiful experience to have attended the Ganga Aarti with nice bhajans also playing. Though found things a bit commercial but that doesn't matter because its everywhere, till the time you are happy and in solace seeing the Aarti. Felt beautifully connected with the River Ganga ðŸ‘ŒðŸŒ·"
There are ceremonies in the evening on both sides of the Ganges and both are quite different. Nice walk over the suspension bridge. Watch out for the monkeys.
"We attended 2 aarti. First time in Parmath Niketan, near Ram Jhula. Full of foreigners dancing. Felt so weird.The second time, it was here at Triveni Ghat. i sat among locals who chanted and sang along the music, with respectful minds. Even little kids like 3 years old sat clapping their hands. Before the ceremony, just hang around the ghat or the market nearby."
"Triveni Ghat is a little away from Tapovan area, it's where we were staying so. Triveni Ghat is in Rishikesh Town area. Like every other Ghat , this Ghat also has Ganga Aarti every evening at sunset. We've seen a lot of Ganga Aartis in India but Triveni Ghat is our favorite. It was such a spiritual experience. The songs, the beats, the diyas. Everything was so mesmerizing. We felt truly blessed to have attended this aarti. According to me, the aarti here is a must visit"
"Good experience to view Ganga Arti at Triveni Ghat... Being winter season, the Arti takes place at around 5:45pm..."
Yes..it is Devine. Take a walk at the bank of ganga in the evening and reach the ghat at time of arati. It is well organized. .less crowded. .even you can do arati and puja by yourself by the help of pujari and enjoy the evening.
Recommended by hotel staff for aarti at this places was great ful. Nice place on bank of river with lovely sound of aarti. Crowded but large places
Was in Rishikesh for 2 days and both days visited Triveni Ghat for the evening Ganga Aarti. They know how to put a spectacle. Extremely well organised and involve the people by giving them an opportunity to do the Aarti. The Aarti singers are very very good and you feel good about the whole experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the aartis and think it is much better than what I saw in Haridwar. Absolutely recommended.
Performing Puja and Aarti at  Triveni Ghat is awsome. Singer and his band was really great. It is organised by 'Ganga Sabha' .
Attended evening aarti at Triveni ghat...Neat and clean.. Fantastic atmosphere and most beautiful music next to the strong flowing Ganga.. Excellent start to our trip into the Himalayas.. Thank you for a surreal experience!
"Triveni Ghat is THE place to see the Ganga Aarti! With live bhajans, meticulous step by step process, its a peaceful and divine experience. From our hotel, we had escort service to the aarti and were seated in a place from where we had a very nice view of the entire aarti. The live bhajans, complete with pleasing accompaniments enhances the Ganga aarti experience. So very well managed. Having seen the Ganga aarti at Haridwar, i would strongly suggest that Triveni ghat aarti is the best. We did Ganga Snaan in this ghat as well. Very very clean.  Swach Bharat ideology is maintained by the tireless workers here. The changing rooms for ladies are pretty clean with several stalls manned by a lady supervisor. For the kind of population that this town receives, i would give this ghat a super thumbs up in terms of cleanliness & the overall management. The boardwalk on this ghat is so very wonderful, especially in the mornings and evenings, with Ganga flowing right next to you. The entire boardwalk is very very clean with no shops or hawkers. MUST VISIT PLACE!!!"
The place is good at the evening time during hot summer days. The Ganges water just soothes the mind and body. Evening arti alongside the Ganges is divine. Worth a visit.
"Visited Rishikesh after a long time and it has changed a lot ! Its Crowded too but there are few ashrams where you can stay peacefully,meditate & relax.Visited Triveni ghat for the evening arathi and we got to sit closely and watch the priests performing the Ganga arathi against the backdrop of the river gushing. It was indeed mesmerising to watch the arathi. Must visit when in Rishikesh."
Visited here for morning and evening and enjoyed gangs aarti ceremony in evening . nice bank of river .shopping areas .
"We came here during an evening walk on the riverside promenade and, although it is a very orchestrated, structured Aarti, it still lends itself to being a very spiritual experience. Leave your shoes with the security (a tip is expected), enter the fenced in area (there is also an unfenced area where you don't need to remove your shoes, but has no seating) take a few pictures, and then you are ushered to carpeted, cement steps amongst the many, many people who have come here to pray at this lovely site on the Ganga. Drummers and bell ringers, all dressed exactly the same, step up onto raised platforms in a synchronized manner, and then devotees who have either brought or purchased their offerings of oil lamps and flowers on leaf boats can place them in the holy waters. Please note that, in the plaza at Triveni Ghat, there are a large number of people who ask for food and money. I have been told that people in the area always donate to them because it is blessing to help someone in need. It is your choice, though. You can also visit the evening market/shops that are right next to the ghat and where you will find local folks looking for the same bargains as you are."
A must watch spectacle at Rishikesh. Ganga Aarti start at 6 PM and it is simply amazing. Go prepared to spend about half hour and get mesmerised by the aarti.
"It's was amazing experience, must visit Triveni ghat. Paid 300 RS and performed puja at ghat. Pandit perform all the puja and you can do Aarti along with them. It's very organised. Peaceful and with less of crowd, you can actually feel the energy."
"the Triveni ghat is less crowded than the one near Laxman Jhoola. The format and duration of aarti remaining same.Starts around 6.30-7pm and easy to find a good place. The pandits are very polite and invite spectators to take part in the actual aarti. The ganga aarti is one of the most spiritual sublime aartis I have witnessed. The lighting of the flames and diyas , the chanting, bhajans all synchronised are beautiful. Lasts for around 45 minutes and you can then take the diyas and flowers and float it in the Ganges."
"In case you have only 1 evening in Rishikesh and you want to see the Aarti, this is your place. Reach there by 5.45 pm sharp and grab your seat. Only issue is it's location which is quite far from both Ram Jhula and Laxman Jhula."
Triveni Ghat is less crowded silent Ghat in Rishikesh. A dozen of pandits perform Ganga Aarti. A spectacular view for half an hour. You can perform aarti yourself by paying some charges before it commences. Go there nearly an hour earlier to have best view. Don't forget to have some snacks in Bikaner restaurant on ghat as it offers delicious food.
Excellent enjoyment of the Ganga Aarati. Need to remain present at 5.30 PM.The place is crowded during evening period. Here everything is pure and good.
"This is the least commercialized of the two Ganga Aartiâ€™s in Rishikesh. More locals here. We were there by 5.15 pm and settled ourselves on the steps. This is where you should sit to get a lovely view of the whole procession. Everything was so orderly. They start at exactly 6pm. The singing and chanting were just beautiful. Thereâ€™s a place to keep your shoes for a very small fee. Itâ€™s good to carry wet wipes or old socks if youâ€™re worried about dirtying your shoes. Having said that, I must say they upkeep this place fairly well. Thereâ€™s also a walkway from Triveni Ghat where you can walk along the Ganges river. It was just breathtaking. The water is extremely clean."
"If there's one place you must visit after the other popular attractions of Rishikesh, its the mermerizing evening Ganga Aarti @ Triveni Ghat. Occupy your seat atleast 30 minutes in advance, to enjoy the approx 30 mins spiritual journey.The well coordinated aarti is almost as if its divinely choreographed. A must experience atleast once in your lifetime."
Truly Divine and peaceful - Must have experience. Go at evening to enjoy Aarti organized by them. Thanks.
"Wonderful, peaceful, enjoyable place especially in the evening. Sitting at the ghat, watching Aarti make yourself happy. Enjoying the flowing cool Ganga is amazing."
Amazing Ganga Aarti. A different spiritual feeling when you attend the Aarti here. Listening to the holy songs and chants. So relaxing and spiritually uplifting
"Went to witness grand Ganga Aarti, which was truly mesmerising.I found, It as one of the best and the cleanest ghats for taking a dip in Holy Ganga.Water was not that deep; however flow was quite powerful.Jai maa Gange !!"
Gives you goose bumps with all the bhajans and the ambiance.They all go in sync and it lasts for about 45 Minutes.It doesn't have any entry fee. Just go with a calm mind and  feel the fresh breeze of The Ganges and nothing but positivity all around you.CheersShilpa
Such a holy and historic place the Triveni Ghat. A fantastic venue for the Ganga Aarti @ Rishikesh. Enjoyed the entire experience. Extremely peaceful experience.UNFORGETTABLE !!!!
Attended evening Aarti Totally different feeling. Felt Blessed. Different spiritual experience. Got energized. Too crowded. Should reach 1 hour early minimum so you can get better place. Must Visit.
This is a must do event in Riskikesh for devotees and even tourist interested in local and ancient customs. If you want to have rituals for you/family etc. Expect to give 300INR donation to the temple and then have additional donations made direct to Brahmins for their spiritual service. It is a beautiful and dramatic experience of prayer and light!
Mesmerising experience it was to be part of the evening Aarti at Triveni Ghaat. It was there in to do list for long.
"Evening Aarti at Har-ki- Paudi is quite crowed but if you really want to enjoy this ritual- you should go to Triveni Ghat in Rishikesh. It is really mesmerising. Around 15 Priests do the evening Aarti in a well synchronised manner along with well tuned rhymes & bhajans after the Aarti, it is an enthralling experience which is difficult to forget"
Flooded with tourists. Nice and pleasant experience to view. Starts around sunset around 6 pm upto 7pm. Must visit and view the same if around Rishikesh.
"This is a popular venue and we were advised to get there early to enjoy a good view.  The ceremony is enchanting to watch, accompanied by sung prayers.  Following the ceremony there is a musical performance which, on the occasion of our visit, included a rendering of the Hare Krishna mantra which older readers will recall was performed by George Harrison of The Beatles.  Great entertainment which you can join in with.   Enjoyed this more than the evening Aarti at Haridwar."
