"We saw this lovely city on our conducted tour around the Golden Ring, and we were here for one night and half a day.  In my opinion, the BEST thing, by far, in Yaroslavl was the riverside walk along the Volga River.  One of the best riverbank walks I have experienced, anywhere in the world.  The river looks great, and there are some very interesting churches on the walk, apart from some other beautiful buildings.  Very very photogenic.  Even in bad weather!  If it is a nice sunny day, you could not ask for more!  Remember, this city is over a thousand years old, our guide regaled us with plenty of stories of the past.  It is the biggest city between Moscow and the Arctic."
"Beautiful day to view the area and the bear made of flowers.  A stunning vista in north-central Russia.  Many sites to visit nearby.  Don't forget to rub the wishing stone nearby the newly-rebuilt church, Assumption Cathedral (Uspensky Sobor).The first wooden cathedral was built here in 1215, destroyed by fire it was then rebuilt in the 16th Century and was completely destroyed again in the 20th Century by the Soviets.  In 2005 it was decided to rebuild the cathedral once again and in an astonishing feat of construction the huge building was completed in just five years. The interiors of the church are now white washed with a few icons covering the walls and a new iconostasis and some wealthy locals have donated their antique icons to the cathedral which are on display. Just outside the cathedral’s original bells have also been assigned a place."
"We took a walking tour of Yaroslavl and stared out along the embankment. Beautiful walkway bustling with all sorts of activities. Buy an ice cream, sit and watch the world go by from a park bench, indulge in an array of souvenirs, or just walk and take in the beauty of the day."
"Walking along the embankment by the Volga was a lovely way to spend a few hours. It is such a pretty walk with gardens, fountains etc along the way, and beautiful views of the river. We even hired electric scooters to enjoy another loop around the embankment and this was great fun!"
"I like this place. Been visiting Yaroslavl' numerous times during last forty years and always try to come here. Not a lot has changed around - same stunning views on the Volga river, same charming trademark pavillion, same gorgeous trees and same sidewalks in need of repair, scarce kiosks with souvenirs and almost total lack of places to sit down and have a cup of tea or coffee.This time one of us stepped onto a pile of dung left by some enormous dog (hopefully not a man). Dear residents of Yroslavl', please clean up after your pets - their poo's stench is remarkable! Thanks God that day was rainy and there were many pools around. (But still - he reeked all hell for quite some time.)"
An interesting place to walk on a Sunday afternoon to watch the families out for walks. This is a cruise boat stop and you can easily leave the boat and follow the embankment path past colorful historic buildings and into the parks. A further walk takes you into downtown. Wear good walking shoes though.
"take a slow walk in the evening, all the main museums are here. Couple of good restaurants too. You can even take a ride on a rental bycicle."
Go during the summer- it is much more picturesque . Don't go too early as I was too early that the ferry station isn't open yet
"The place to spend a nice evening with a bottle of wine, great company and a marvelous Volga view. Feel yourself like the Yaroslav Mudriy but a 1000 years in the future"
Great walk. Beautiful views. Lotsof things to see and to do. Historical place. Placed to eat.Just Fab!
"Start be walking through the city park at Krasny Plochade to the banks of the Volga.  Check ot the river cruises.  You will pass at least three museums before you reach the point where a smaller river joins the Volga.  Founding of Yaroslavl park reminded me of Pittsburgh.  Cathedral, monastery and downtown all are close to the end of your walk"
"The stroll along the Volga River is delightful on a warm day.  The park is well designed, and well maintained.  There are wide sidewalks, fountains, excellent views of the area and river.  It almost like strolling in Paris!  Enjoy the statues at the end, celebrating the 1010 founding of the city."
"Lovely strolling path in the shade of trees - it was actually sticky due to lime-trees, obviously in Russia it is blossoming in August and not in June like in my home town. leads to a modern and very nice Yaroslavl park, laid down for city anniversary (formed in 1010 - city, not the park)."
This walk will impress at any weather. Dress appropriately warm. Take your camera. Vistas are divine.Stray off into streets and check details on older buildings.Breath-taking.
"Volga embankment is a very popular promenade among locals. This is where people come out to see and be seen. It stretches from the port all the way around the Strelka to Spassky monastery. There are easy access points to all things downtown – Red Square, Church of Ilya the Prophet, the new Cathedral of Assumption and old parkland with exclusive tennis clubs. Considered a part of the “restricted area” during Soviet days it now boasts many boutique cafes and museums."
