"The bridge and the mountain view is an awe! The Varda Viaduct is locally known as ""Alman Köprüsü"" or ""Koca Köprü"" (literally: German Viaduct or Big Viaduct), is a railway viaduct situated at Hacıkırı (Kıralan) village in Karaisalı district of Adana Province in southern Turkey. Designed and built by Imperial German engineers as part of the Baghdad Railway. The building of the viaduct was coupled with the construction of the Ottoman-German project of Istanbul-Baghdad railway line to connect Berlin with Basra, then part of the Ottoman Empire, to enable direct supply of oil to German industry. The most difficult terrain on the route to overcome was the section at the Taurus Mountains between Konya and Adana, more specifically around the region of Belemedik, where in a distance of 12 km (7.5 mi) 22 tunnels in a row had to be dug in twenty years. In 1903, the construction work force, consisting of German technical staff and thousands of multi-national workers, settled in a camp newly established in Belemedik, where all necessary facilities such as hospital, church, school, movie theatre and even mosque were built. The construction began in 1905, and in 1907, the main works were completed. Technical details were accomplished in 1912. The railway on the viaduct went into service in 1916. The train jump scene in 007 Skyfall movie was shot on this bridge. The bridge is over 100 years old and still holding strong."
"Beautiful bridge built by the Germans in the 1910's. Beautiful scenery and surroundings. The trip there on its own is worth it. Very popular among people of the area. You can get something local to eat, tea or coffee to drink and there is a bathroom if you don't want to use the bushes. Everything minimalistic.Scene of one of the clips in the Skyfall movie. Be sure to be surprised by the movie tricks that were being used to make it look different than the real thing. Beautiful plants in the ravine and all around. There is an easy hiking trail down into the river."
James Bond inspired trip. Pretty bridge but there is not much around there to do except the mountains but great for a picnic or bbq. Get a good view of it from the small tea place opposite.
Being a James Bond fan this was a must on my bucket list! A fantastic place to visit and totally unspoilt! Visited on a Sunday and very quiet! A must visit if you are staying in and around Adana x
Visited today. Great drive up. A bit scary. Seen lots of locals. Great piece of architecture. A little scary looking down from top.
"50 km from Adana with the last 10 km on dirty roads. Road improvement ongoing so should be a pleasure driving in the near future.Bridge is impressive. Great photo shooting location with the bridge in back ground.The road around the ravine (passes through the rock) is extremely narrow and not for the faint hearted, especially when passing oncoming traffic.The bridge top has hand rails only on one side. Hold on tightly to young kids.Dusty road but worth the visit."
