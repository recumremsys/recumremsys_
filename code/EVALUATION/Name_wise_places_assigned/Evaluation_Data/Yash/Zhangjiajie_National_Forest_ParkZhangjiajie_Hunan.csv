"This place was so unusual and meditative, it took around three months ruminating on and about my feelings. I tried to grasp the ambiance mentally, to perceive the greatness of this place. And I would never be my previous self.You'll see as many pillar shaped rocks on uwur journen through this forest park, as you've never seen before. Don't rush, embrace it, think about its greatness."
"This is one of the the most beautiful places I have ever visited. Is looks like a fairytale and unlike Huangshan they really organized everything pretty well. We traveled with our two boys - 6 and 7 years old - and they had a great time walking, looking at the mountains and the monkeys. Oh and enjoying the Mcdonalds on top of one of the mountains 🙃"
"We spent 3 days in Zhangjiajie with out tour guide Mr Ash, who we got through Grace Yang (zjjexpert@foxmail.com) as she had another group she was working with. We were staying at a neaby hotel 5 minutes walk to the national forest park entry. The first day was the national forest park and it is simply a sight to behold, and the pathways are well mapped out and maintained. The signage is also on point. There are many wonders of nature. We enjoyed trekking and riding the cable car to the top of the mountain. We also saw the inspiration to the movie avatar 'son of heaven' mountains that shoot up for the the deep valley with layers of rock packed onto each other so precisely. There is also a beautiful mountain lake within the park. Being the only black people among the sea of Chinese and very countable Caucasians, the Chinese, both young and old were quite mesmerized by our skin color, they were secretly taking photos, recording us and some went even ahead to touch our skin to feel it. We weren't bothered though as we understood it is a very remote tourist city and many chinese may never have ventured out further into other major cities. We came down with the world's fastest elevator, it is in the Guinness world book of records.The second day we went to the Yellow dragon cave which is one of its kind and very deep and Boafeng lake which is so beautiful atop the mountain. We also did the Grand Canyon glass bridge. My wife's legs were all of a sudden jelly and she couldn't look down the canyon through the glass. It is an experience of its kind, the heights are dizzying but all the same awesome work of engineering. We also had a chance to sample chinese local delicacies. We got into a tea house and got to learn the art of tea drinking.The 3rd day we went to the Tianmen mountains and rode the worlds longest and highest cable car. 7.5 Km long, on top of the mountain we also did the cliff walk on terrible heights, it was rainy and foggy, my wife was overjoyed that the fog was hiding the scary heights on the cliff side walk and hence not afraid. Coming down we used the chairlift and also the elevators that are dug in the middle of the mountains (give it to the chinese) We also walked down the 999 steps from the gateway to heaven and later took the bus down the winding roads down the mountains to the station in town.Overall, it was a great time and our guide Ash"
"I was guided to this place by a friend who is working in China. This is an area that must be in the top ten areas of outstanding natural beauty anywhere in the world. It provided the inspiration for the hallelujah mountains in the film ‘Avatar’. The area is dominated by the limestone pillars topped by trees. However no photograph can do justice to the epic scale of these structures, they truly need to be seen to be believed. Give yourself some time and try to visited a range of locations. This is a place that will stick with you forever."
"The experience I got from this place is beyond my expectation. This forest park is just awesome. I took many pictures so I can capture how beautiful this place is. But camera just can't do the justice. You have to see it on your own. Prepare for lots of walking, hiking, and trekking. But it's all worth it..."
"This place is by far one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. The price of 247 yuan is steep but it’s valid for 3 days which is good. We didn’t bother getting any cable cars, we just hiked from the bottom up to the top of where the avatar mountains are. The scenery along the hike is amazing not only because of the views but because you basically have it to yourself with not many people around. Once you get to the actual avatar mountain area, it’s so full of Chinese tourists, it starts to turn into a nightmare. Walking shoulder to shoulder with spitting Chinese who have no care in the world that you are also trying to take pictures. Absolute nightmare. But you have to endure it if you want to see this part of the national park. Taking the bus takes an agonising 1h30mins or so. It’s tiring/annoying if you are trying to get a full day at the park."
"This was an amazing experience and place to visit in China. I had arrangements before arrival with the great tour guide Frank Chen < frankusa123@outlook.com > and his driver. They made our experience smooth and easy with a lot of information about the park and the other places we visited. It had snowed a few days before our arrival, but we weren’t affected a lot by that ( we got lucky). Being in this national forest feels like you are in a nice different looking fary land full of wonders."
"Truly amazing experience.  As westerners we were in a real minority. I think we saw about 20 others in four days. But the Chinese welcome and helpfulness made this experience even better. There is only one tip I would give: hire a guide. We hired Chris Tan (tanjunxi@126.com).  A wonderfully informative chap who knew just where to go and most importantly, when.  He drove us around and we managed to avoid virtually all the queues. We saw the lot too! He was attentive to our food requirements too. We like Chinese food but he wanted to be sure that we didn’t get things we might not expect ...all that in an authentic restaurant. His service extended to picking us up at the airport, dropping our daughter back there and giving us lifts after his guide services had ended. He made our trip very special.  Add to that one of the best sightseeing experiences we have had (and we travel a lot!) and this is an unbeatable package at an affordable price...believe me ...it’s worth it!"
Zhangjiajie National park is a must for all those visiting China. We hired a guide for five days that took us all over the park. With incredible scenery seen from a cable car and chairlift high amongst the clouds. Breathtaking stuff. We walked along the canyon floor along side the  Gold whip stream...just gorgeous. We went with Tour China Guide. Zania was our guide she was informative . Her English was reasonable. And most of the time she understood what we asked or said. Do yourself a favor and dont miss out on this park. Tour China Guide is the best!
"We stayed in Zhangjiajie city and paid 12RMBpp for a bus to the park entrance (takes roughly and hour - ticket purchased on the bus and if you show a staff member the park map they will put you on the right bus). The ticket to enter the park costs 248RMBpp (valid for entry for 3days) and purchase only at the gate, not the scalpers hanging around outside!With your ticket you're given a map and you can determine your walking route. If you only have one day we suggest avoiding the glass bridge and elevator (you'll avoid a lot of crowds this way - and save some money on something thats actually quite overrated). Visit the Avatar mountain scenic area early - or it will seem just as busy as the metro stations at peak hour! This circuit is simply stunning and the reason we visited the region. We were lucky that we arrived early and seemed to have it all to ourselves, it was well worth the journey and 1hr climb up stairs to get there! (You can also take a shuttle if your concerned about fitness level)Some of the walks can be challenging, wear good shoes and plan carefully if you're not of adequate fitness level. Theres plenty of food options with local stalls, KFC and McDonalds on the mountain top!We would recommend at least 2days there to see everything thats worthwhile without rushing. It would be much closer and easier to stay in Wulingyuan, a funky little town right at the entrance gate to the park."
"The National Park is huge.  We stayed in Yangjiajie which is more rural with fewer queues to get into the park.  The tickets are valid for 4 days and include the park buses to get around to various areas.  The elevator and cable cars are expensive but helpful if you want to get to other areas more quickly and with less walking.  Lots of people we met either didn't have a map or didn't have a very good map of the park so try to get a good one before entering the park.  You can get a guide to take you around the park but with a good map you shouldn't need one.  Public buses from the city to the park area are cheap.  Stay in a hotel closer to the park (rather than Zhangjiajie City) so you can make the most of your time - the park closes around sunset.We made use of the full 4 days in the park.  We were there during a week where it was cloudy and a bit rainy but we were still able to get some great views.  On a rainy day you should still get views along the Golden Whip Stream (even if it is cloudy up top).  Be prepared to climb lots of stairs, see lots of monkeys, and see some amazing scenery.  You can get some snacks along the way but you might want to bring food/drink with you for the day.  Make sure you avoid Golden Week in China (around 1-7 Oct).  We postponed our arrival and the park was much more peaceful and queues were shorter."
"Many people thought the landscape in the movie Avatar was animated computer generated; it was not, this is the landscape where it was filmed.  I was surprised to see monkeys here but since monkeys (macaques) are also found in Japan I wasn't that surprised, I did photograph a couple.  This park is huge but there is adequate bus transportation to move people about different view areas.  My guide and I also used a walking trail of about 2 or 3 Kms to avoid getting to some crowded areas.  It was not strenuous,  I am 71 years old, was actually a comfortable walk cloudy but not rainy with excellent views and places to sit and take a break along the way.  I would strongly recommend people visit Wulingyuan National Park, well worthwhile.  Having a local Chinese speaking tour guide is also a great help when visiting places like this in China.  Beware Chinese will often push and crowd to get ahead of people, stand your own ground, the local people understand this and it is a normal routine there as well as other countries in East Asia."
"Amazing to walk on glass across a gorge with lots of folks. The glass ( newest) bridge is well worth the effort to arrive at Zhangjiajie national area! How one gets there is a topic for discussion, a reputable travel agency is advised and always keep your valuables on your person.( enough said) In my / our case the ride from Wuhan via high speed rail to Jingzhou was smooth and quite as per usual on the rail system. The bus ride via tourist agency from Jingzhou to the national park ...leaves a lot to be desired . I will express my disgust in the fact that the tour agency does try and pressure sell you on items at last stop prior to your hotel ... I absolutely despise that .....So you have been forewarned .The worlds longest and tallest glass bridge is worth every penny spent to arrive there .( minus the pressure sale).... Not just the bridge but the entire scenery , water fall.  Creeks , lake,cave( bandits)...boat ride and yes the picture session with "" the monkey king""... A person just has to keep their sense of humor and enjoy life !  The path of life and enjoyment is about 2.8 kilometers long !( 99%Down hill) praise Buddha! Also a few vertical step challenges... but not bad .The staging area for the bridge is organized , restrooms are always backed up with people .( could use more of them)  but walking to and on bridge is at your leisure ....Once you put on the rubber booties and dare yourself to walk on glass 2-3000 feet above the little tiny river way down there ! Should you still have that sense of humor I was talking about a minute ago .... jump up and down on the center glass!!!.....Godzilla has arrived!( maybe that's just me )!Anyway booking the trip via local agency was actually cheap $400 US ( for2 )I suppose they hope for sales... I will say that I was the only English/American  (245 pounds) ... maybe that's why Godzilla came ! Included in this deal was -train, bus, 2 nights,2 meals, park pass ...great adventure for the daring ! Or you can drive there yourself , which I will opt for the next trip .Technical things- fear of heights ( don't look down)🤣Seriously you must be 5 feet tall . No weight limit , water and food stops along the Travel path after bridge....Absolutely beautiful scenery mixed with modern technology!"
"It's unfortunate that this is one of the most renowned attractions in China.For one thing, the landscape, while exotic and generally attractive, is far from surreal or or astounding. Just based on the scenery itself, this place maybe gets 3.5 stars.  This place isn't within the top 10 in Asia, or even in Mainland China. But then you have to take into consideration the exorbitant ticket price (around $35 USD, which doesn't even include the elevators or cable cars, both of which are also exorbitantly priced). If you want to visit the place independently, you also have to take into consideration the general lack of organization of the place -- the maps and signage are awful (and reading and speaking Chinese only helps marginally), and the shuttle bus routes are very confusing. And as in most famous places in China, the park is absolutely mobbed with Chinese tourists, who behave as you expect Chinese tourists to. While it is true that hiking is pleasant and allows you to leave 95% of the crowds behind, the hikes are generally in forested paths, so you don't get any opportunity to appreciate the views in peace. In short, China is full of spots which are much more scenic and much less stressful than Zhangjiajie. Assuming your time (or your budget) is limited, it's best to skip this one."
A place that i enjoyed myself in China. Beautiful and stunning scenery. Went in december but so lucky that we caught the stunning view of this beauty. Definitely a worth experience. The mountains are very beautiful. December is an off peak seasons so it's not pack with tourist.
"Breathtaking national park which was the inspiration for the Avatar Floating mountains scenery. Very little english but it is possible to get around without a guide as there are many shuttles that are free once you pay the entrance fee (300Yuan for 4 days I think) that take you everywhere within the park. Yangjiejie is a must see, as is Hallelujah Mountains! Take the long cable car and Bailing lift as well!"
"The mountain formations are something to witness! It is amazing to see the massive pillars towering over you or next to you when in the cable car. There are numerous scenic stops that you reach via buses. Navigating was quite a challenge since there were multiple different maps and the signs are not accurate with informing you of your location. Multiple people (even locals), were lost and even asking how to get off of the mountain. This is quite difficult and can become laborious, which kind of spoils the mood. When you are in the area, I highly recommend visiting Tianmen mountain which is not far from Zhangjiajie"
Wonderful place to see. We are fron Canada and it was myself 60 yrs old and my daughter 23 yrs old on a trip to see China. Had a tour guide English speaking called Zinia. She was very informative and told alot of stories of the area and the region as well as the National park. We spent 2.5 days in the park and saw it from both sides of the canyon as well as walked along the Gold Whip stream. You can check with Zinia if you want information on tours or the area in general at 1127619454@qq.comThe scenery from Avatar came from this location and very different from anything else I've seen around the world.  Totally recommend this park on your trip to see the natural beauty of China.
This place is a must-see.  Breathtaking views from so many places.  Pictures just don't do it justice.  See for yourself the beauty of this place!  Take your time.  There are many place to explore and see.  The shuttle takes you between everything.  We had a guide.  That was helpful.
"A must see place when in China! We were lucky enough to visit on a sunny day in May. Stunning scenery. Used the tourist bus to get around. Monkeys can be a problem so remember not to hold any food in your hand nor get food out your bag when the monkeys are about. Put food inside a rucksack, don’t hold a carrier bag with food in it or the monkeys will rush up and grab it. All common sense really! Recommend a visit here."
"I had high expectations from all the videos I had seen and reviews I had read. The park was not disappointing at all, it even exceeded my expectations.After a week in Shanghai and Hangzhou and then a 18 hour train ride, it was nice to be out in nature. The difference in air quality is very noticeable.I started out with the cable car to Huangshi village. There I completed a full circuit of the plateau, which took me 3 hours or so. The sceneries here are quite something. At several places there are platforms where you can hear echoes if you yell loudly, which of course many people did.After this circuit, I went back down to the main road. Here I followed the Golden Whip Stream. This was quite something. It was very peaceful to stroll past the stream. There are monkeys in this area and they are out in the open. One of them got pretty close to me, but generally they don't come too close to people. They are the cute, small kind, so it was fun to look at.Instead of taking the Bailong elevator, I took a left towards a set of stairs. Initially, it didn't look like there were many steps and I was expecting about 30 minutes of climbing. Boy was I in for a treat. 2 hours later I managed to reach the top. Mind you, I was pretty out of shape and stopped many, many times along the way. Some nice fellow travellers encouraged me on the way and even offered me water and snacks. Nice people!Once at the top, I was rewarded with more breathtaking views of the karst mountains spread across the park.At the top there are also a few hotels down the road. I had heard that the government had closed down all hotels inside the park, but it turns out that there are still a few up and running.I would recommend staying at least 2 nights here, since it is quite a large park and you can hike for 2 whole days for sure."
If you go at the right time. I joined a tour and we started calling our tour “into the mist” as that was all we were seeing. Check the weather as we went when it rained and we saw nothing but white mist.
"**BEWARE OF DISGUISED TOUTERS, TAXI, AND FAKE TOURIST CENTERS**I like to explore places at my own pace and value opinions of locals. I'd say I have some level of street-smart and can smell touters from far away. This is the first place where touting has invaded the society at such a level that scares me. The hotel recommended me a local eatery (nondescript, popular local chain, none of the bells and whistles of a tourist-catering restaurant) where I was served by a smiley lady. She took orders, served food, chatted us up, and told us we can't book tickets at the venue (untrue),Tianmen Mountain entrance is too far (untrue), and to take a cab there. We rejected street touters on the way, got in the taxi who brought us to an official-looking building (we told the taxi driver we wanted to buy tickets). The building reads ""Tourist Information Center"" in Chinese - we later found several more around. There, the staff told us tickets are only available for very late afternoon (untrue), and it would be very hard to get out of the park in one day (untrue). So far, everybody has the same consistent story but this smells too much like a scam so we walked away, but not without having let them photocopy our passport first. Back in the city, we further experienced aggressive street touters who will follow you to the edge of their ""territory"", ""fakers"" who will pretend to chase off said touters and point you to the wrong direction towards other touters. Real locals however, are terrified to give us direction in the core city area. TL;DR; Be careful of touters because they can be in cahoots with local restaurants, taxi drivers, and maybe even some hotels. They can also pretend to be helpful locals and give wrong directions.Unguided travel - Zhangjiajie is very do-able without a guide. To get there, enter the entrance right beside the train station and you will be able to take a public bus costing 12RMB to Forest Park Ticket Entrance (森林公园门票站). The bus will bring you near the park entrance. Just walk along the road for another 5 minutes or so to reach the park entrance. There, buy tickets from the booth (available to foreigners for immediate entrance) which gives you a 3-day pass. If you are there early (reached before 10am), a full-day trip is possible. I'd recommend to visit Golden Whip Stream, walk up YuanJiaJie, take the eco bus to Tianzi Mountain, and choose your preferred mode down the mountain. From there, you can take the eco bus to the nearest exit, which has several names: 标志们门票站/武陵源门票站/吴家峪门票站 (respectively: Standard Entrance, Wulinyuan entrance and Wujiayu entrance). Recommended to get out at ~6pm, which means to start climbing down Tianzi Mountain at 3pm, or take the Cableway down at 5pm. This is do-able in one day if you start in the morning and have normal fitness level. From that entrance, enter ""汽车站“ into Baidu Maps and find your way there (~10mins walk). You can then buy tickets back to Zhangjiajie for 14RMB. The trip will take less than an hour. Weather - Zhangjiajie is prone to rain, so prepare for that or check the weather forecast. It is not very high up, so the temperature is similar to that of the city. T-shirt and shorts suffice for summer. Food and drinks - There are some food and drink options along the way, we had very nice jelly from one of the vendors in the mountain. Most of it is near the ecobus stop. Monkeys - the monkeys can be aggressive, especially in groups. Many tourists like to feed them so they are not scared of humans. Despite us carrying no food with us, the monkeys tried to climb onto us and I got a small scratch in the process."
"Second time going to Zhangjiajie and always impressed by the size and the Sceneries displayed in this natural wonder. First of all, I believe there is no specific season to visit the park. I have been there is September and March, and both months were quite enjoyable, Sept being a little bit hot and wet however. 3-4 days in the area is quite enough to see the main point of interest : the national park,l (2 days), Tianmen and the canyon. You can sleep the first 2 nights in Wulingyuan, close to the entry of the park. (Taxi from airport to Wulingyuan: ~100-150元, 40mn).You will find water and food in the park. Generally the walking path is easy and well indicated.Day 1: take your 4 days tickets to ZJJ park (220元pp). You can take the bus to Tianzi mountain cable way (78元pp). Just enjoy the view from the cable way and from the top, then take a second bus to Tianzi mountain (10mn, all bus are free), you can stroll around, and enjoy the first landscapes. (There is also a McDonald's for those looking for some Western food). When you are done, a second bus will bring you Yangjiajie cableway/village (30mn ride). From here you can enjoy a 30mn/1hr walk, far from most tourists, by turning left when arriving in front of the cableway. You will go down the stairs and then need to look to the path to a ""step to heaven"". Be prepared to climb stairs, but the calm up there is worth it. A last bus will drive you to Yuanjiajie, where the most famous landscapes are visible (avatar mountain, rock bridge). Be prepared to a lot of tourists. When done, you can either take a bus to Bailing elevator, but I would recommend to go down by the path (1hr walk) until you reach the water stream. There turn left and simply follow the river to the bus station (1 hr walk). You will see incredible landscapes if you choose this small trek. seeing all the pillars from below may be more impressive. A bus will bring you back to East entre. Enjoy a well deserved rest at your hotel. Day 2: my recommendation is to head to Huangshi village, less famous than the other part of park, but almost as good, and really quiet compared to day 1. Take a taxi/didi to Huangshi village (west entry), then head to the cableway (68 元pp). You will need ~2hrs to do the upper part, then you can either go down with the cableway or walk down (2hrs). You can take a taxi back to Wulingyuan or walk along the river to Bailong elevator and from there take the bus to East entry. Day 3: Tianmen was quite an enjoyable surprise,you will need one day to visit it. Don't be afraid of the price (258元pp). Otherwise the canyon may be interesting, but I have heard the glass is not that transparent anymore."
"We spent a lovely three days In the Zhangjiajie Park. (I wouldn’t do any more than that) We stayed In a place called “Mini Inn” near the Yuangjiajie entrance to the park, it was the most amazing inn, very close to the trails, serving cheap amazing food and offering amazing customer service. Getting into the park costs 255 yuan but we used our student cards and got in for 125. When in the park we realised the orange roots were essentially motorways for people. Crowded and irritating but we discovered the green roots (marked on the maps) which were almost entirely empty and beautifully scenic. We even asked a local up in the hills for a different root and he pointed us towards an abandoned trail that looped around the mountains making it feel like a true adventure The place is increasingly touristy and areas are already spoiled by the numbers of tourists (especially the avatar mountain area) but as soon as you leave these routes it is once again an absolute gem!"
"Our tour of Zhangjiajie is one of the highlights of our 17-day trip in China. Walking the 999 steps up and down, seeing in person the Heavens Gate and the coiling road of 99 turns, experiencing the thrill of walking the coiling dragon glass walk and the Grand Canyon Glass bridge; be there in person to admire the amazing Avatar mountain we thought only in movies is it possible; all were next to nothing. The expertise of our guide, the effervescent Lingling  who knows how to to steer us out of unbelievable crowd helped us got the most of this national treasure."
"I visited here as part of a 32-day solo holiday with China Private Tours.Though there seem to be multiple names for the same thing, people come to Zhangjiagie for two areas – the forest with the Avatar spires and Tianmen Mountain closer to the city. Judging by many of the photos of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park on this site, I wasn’t really unlucky to encounter a misty day. It is a shame that sun is not the norm because it would add to the experience. The fog was pretty bad and the view from the high lookouts was very limited. Things improved a little when I got to the glass elevator and the rocky spires were actually visible as we descended. At the bottom there is a train-type vehicle which transports you to a better view of the mountains and the ride itself offers good views as well. This is where I obtained my most fog-free vistas of the dozens of pinnacles that make up some of the stone forest. Obviously if you make the effort to come to this part of China, you’re going to come here whatever the weather and you’ll have to make the best of it. It’s in the hands of the Gods. For me, it was disappointing the high lookouts were a waste of time but at least I did see something while there. If the valley views had been fogged out as well, I would have been cursing. But if the Forest is on your itinerary, you have to be prepared that it might be brilliant or it might be awful. The forest park is about an hour’s drive from the main town."
"This place is very beautiful..awesome. easy to reach from city by bus. BUT when you get in...its confusing. No english signage for bus route... just get in in one to another bus without know where we will go. Its will be better if there is aroute, such as :  area 1 go to...., area 2 go to.... .. etcWe very confuse when we want to change our trip to yuenjiajie(avatar mountain) from wullingyuan area...no signage..no info what we should do.. there is amap but just map without information.. ! 1 of The interchange area from wullingyuan mt to avatar mt is in area Helong park. Just walk to the left side you will find a bazar area. Here it is! Find the cream mini car, take it about 45 minutes ..The car for each area is bus(wullingyuan or avatar) but the interchange car to move beetwen two mountain is minivan( cream color). If you want to chage the mountain use it.. The last trip in wullingyuan(we cone back fr avatar with last van at 5 pm, the van stop in cable car area. we must take it and pay.. from this point no car to go back to wullingyuan entrance. Bus and mini van is free facility"
"I qwill rate 5* for the scenery, but the ticket prices here really made me unsatisfied, especially the elevator fee. 72 rmb just for one way and they dont remind when you buy ticket about it. On ticket its all written by Chinese so of course foreigners like me cant understand. Spend a day to explore the route: bailong elevator - gigantic natural bridge - wuilong village - tiamen mountain then remember to HIKE back if you still have time or CATCH a cable car back to town, DO NOT go back by the old way cause you will have to pay elevator fee AGAIN with ridiculous price similar with cable car and took much longer time cause you will have to stop every tourist spots then find return bus"
"Having had the privilege of traveling to various parts of the world, I was taken back by Trip Advisors remarks on how rude and pushy the Chinese people are.  Before you point a finger at someone else, take a lot at your own.....at least in China they don't go into schools and murder their children....or in churches or synagogues.  How will the world ever learn to respect others and their culture with remarks like this.  I would NEVER use your services - ever."
"We had very high expectations for this park. Was supposed to be the highlight of our trip to China. However, due to the rudeness of the Chinese tourists, rudeness and incompetence of park's staff, expensive cable cars, elevator (you pay a very expensive entry ticket that gives you right to free buses in the park but that's it), not clear signage/maps unfortunately it wasn't a great experience but only an average experience. The most frustrating thing was the difficulty to understand where to take a bus and where the bus would stop. No clear signs/maps and no member of the staff willing to help you out (most of them busy sleeping or playing at the phone). Stunning scenery but... I wouldn't go back! :( I am surprised a UNESCO heritage site is managed so badly."
We went to the national forest on a raining day so not many people at all.  The bus ride there was ok not great but ok.  We arrived  and then brought the tickets then tried to find our way to the cable car took another bus up where we sat on the bus for 15mins while the driver slept :/. We had no idea  what was happening pure laziness is what I put it down to because the park was empty felt the need not to drive at all..    Foggy couldn't see a thing .  People selling rain coats  and in your face was crazy.   The bus ride home well my mum gave the guy the money we needed change  the guy hands mum all the money back and of course you have no idea why because of the language barrier then mum trys to explain you didn't take any money then the man starts shouting sit down sit down.   These man already seated asked what happened can we help thankfully they were on this bus because police hopped on few stops down..  n they sorted it out for us n the whole issue was because mum handed him the money n not put it in the clear plastic box they thought we wanted a free ride.   Was an awful experience  because we were in the  middle on nowhere 45mins back to the hotel n a bus full of non english speaking people.    Was very glad to get off the bus but it did scare us so we cancelled another bit of our trip because that was a 4 hr bus ride god know what would have happened if we got stuck on that 1    Generally the people were amazing always willing to help you out if they can...
Very spectacular scenary. The cable car to the mountain is an excellent architecture. The view was scary coz it is very high but it is probably the longest cable car in the world. Coming down was a put off though. The crowd management was so poor. The rushing to the bus was terrible.
"This place is amazing and well worth a visit. Such amazing scenery and views. So baring this in mind I'll go into a bit more detail with things to be aware of.Firstly the park opens well before 7am.I arrived at the park about 6:50am and there was already lots of people there being let in.For the most part there is really good signage as to where to go. There are a couple of the bus stops that don't have English but there's pretty much always someone to ask.The queue for tickets goes down quickly, tickets are 228¥ (hotels might try selling you a ticket to ""beat the queues"" but they will over charged so it's not worth it.) The ticket lasts for 4 days.Secondly, it is always busy pretty much everywhere. Even when it's not busy there is still a crowd to push pass to get a good picture, but be rude and push pass them, otherwise you will be waiting a long time.There are plenty of facilities at intervals along all the routes even the steep stair routes have toilets and food stalks along the way.You have to use the buses and you have to queue there's no getting round this but the queues go quickly for the most part.All of the routes are well marked and have good footing. However they are long so wear sensible shoes (the amount of Chinese tourists wearing flip flops is surprising).There are multiple ways to the upper routes, 2 walking, 1 elevator and 2 cable cars (that I came across anyway) you have to pay for the cable cars and elevator individually which are about 60-80 ¥ which isn't too much really.The route I took the first day took me up the elevator, there was initially a queue for the first stage you go up but for the second and glass elevator there was no queue so I got close the window and it was a great view.I then took the bus round to the enchanting view which was great, again not too crowded early.You can walk round to the natural bridge from here. If you're there early then it's worth a walk round. On the way there are a few spots with quiet viewpoints. There are a couple of points where there are Y junctions that get pretty cramped with people pushing and shoving, be bold and push through, there is no other way. The worst was the junction before the natural bridge you either go up to bypass the bridge or go left to go over. Once over it's bit too crowded. Once over go upwards but rather than going to the peak go around and there's some quite spots with great views.Follow signs to the car park to get the bus to the next stop.Yangjiajie is the next stop with the great Wall of natural, and tianbo mansion.The wall is worth a look but not the best view.I would about the trek to tianbo. It is steep with a route that has well worn stones that are slippy that make an already dicey route even worse. There's also very slim gaps through rocks. Push through these and you end with a climb up very questionable ladders to a lookout that isn't that amazing, the climb is vertical so if aren't great with heights don't bother. Another tip, if you do this route rather than waiting for people going up and down there a route round the base so go down but then go round not up.The route back from here is also not great so as I say avoid if you aren't looking to push yourself.From the Yangjiajie stop you can get a bus to tianzi mountain.  This has some great views and is worth a wander around.This is also where there is a McDonald's. There's also a tower you can climb that was free and not too crowded.The best views were down past the tower, they were also pretty much empty.Next tip, the bus stop going from tianzi mountain to Yangjiajie was always ridiculously busy whenever ever I passed so avoid going this route.From tianzi mountain I got the bus to the cable car and down and this was great as the views were amazing and I got a car to myself.Day 2 I walked the golden whip stream which was nice and quiet early on I walked along and then back to the step up luancuan slope. This is a tough climb, over 2000 steps, an hour of steps with no flat. It was very difficult and to be honest but really worth the effort, the only views are at the top.Next tip before going to the enchanting viewpoint, head between the shops following signs down, go along and there's some great views with no one there. There are monkeys though. Most were fine but 1 did try and jump for a guys backpack.Day 3 I was extremely tired so just popped in to see the 10 mile natural gallery (not 10 miles at all) I went here first thing at 6:50 and there were already crowds of tour groups. You can walk or get a monorail which you pay for. I walked and the route is awful. It's totally flat but it's a railed walkway where you can only walk 2 people wide, this is the up and down route so you have tours stopping and tours coming down and people pushing passed. It's not a pleasant walk at all and the views were good but not essential.Rather than heading back down this route you can take steps to the tianzi mountain section. I didn't do this but it might have been worth it to avoid going back the way I came in.Next tip, apart from the buses, don't queue, Chinese tourists will randomly stop along routes for no reason or to admire a view for a long time. Push passed and stay ahead of the crowds, especially tour groups.Be prepared to get your photo taken. I'm a white guy with a beard which the Chinese find  facinating. But don't be afraid to say no, if you really don't want to just walk away. It is more fun to just embrace it but if you are hot and sweaty it can be too much.In conclusion it's definitely worth a visit as the views are breathtaking. But be prepared for crowds and plan your route carefully. Know what you want to see and the best route to get there."
"Title says it all. Inside the park there were mini-trains, hundreds of buses, 3 cable cars, and an elevator built into a mountain. Ridiculous. Not to mention the huge our groups with megaphones. There were signs to not disturb the monkeys, but what were the Chinese tourists doing? Throwing things at them, screaming at them, feeding them, and getting dangerously close for photos. Yes, the park is very beautiful. So if you can handle all that, plus the ridiculous prices, then go for it. The best part was the Golden Whip Stream because it got much less busy the farther you went in. Still paved though, which takes away from the hike. I’d visit smaller places any day before ever coming back here again."
