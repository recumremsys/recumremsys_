"Wonderful lazy sea with clean, white sand beach. Great shacks offering good food and drinks. Has some water sports facilities.Highly recommended"
"If you reach this beach via Club Mahindra Resort, you will be amazed to see the calmness, cleanliness and chilling vibe. Take a shack, grab a beer and go for a swim. The water is shallow, so can go deep.Absolutely amazing chill vibe, spent whole afternoon and half evening chilling here. Highly recommended for those who are looking for calm beach and would want to spend time with themselves."
"One of the best beaches we have seen. Quiet, clean, huge just amazing. Hire a bike and cycle for miles on it and stop at beach shacks for refreshments."
"Nice clean, golden sand beach. Something that we people from big cities don't get elsewhere. Go Goa!"
"A beautiful beach on the shores of South Goa. Expect a calm, disturbance free time at this serene beach."
Beach is very clean. One can easily go quite inside the sea and still water will we knee deep. Water sports are available on beach. Not very crowded. Have multiple life guard posts.
"Found this beach pristine clean, with almost white sand and absolutely clean water. The Shacks on this beach are really nice and give very good service. We were staying in Sterling Holidays and resorts, Varca, and this beach was 15 minutes walking distance from our hotel. Although we visited other beaches of Goa ( South, North and Old Goa, all the beaches), but none had this peaceful environment and feel of the beach."
Stayed here with Family and Friends. This is a Beautiful beach with yellow sand. Must visit for anyone coming to South Goa.
"Very nice , neat and clean White sand beach. Not heavily crowded. Has water sports activities. Only few number of Restaurants and Bars."
"Goa, a relaxed place, offering plenty of natural habitat to relax. The best being a sea beach.There are plenty of beaches in Goa and one of the popular one's being Varca Beach. It's popularity is mainly due to central location, closeness to railway station and connectivity to South Goa. Mention of South Goa is required primarily as family vacationers like us visit South Goa for a relaxing seaside vacation and with Club Mahindra offering more than one options in South Goa vicinity, the mention is all the more required.Also, the relaxing and family traveler primarily prefers South Goa. Looking to be away from normal city hustle bustle, the serenity offered by South Goa is the primary attraction of a Goa visit.Varca beach, offers easy on pocket eating places at or near the beach. The beach itself spread across about 1000-1500 meters or probably more, is clean at fringes with central (near to shops and main entry) area requires more upkeep and cleanliness, even in off-season. The situation can be compelling in season - after October.A walk with alone, with your better half or kid can be very relaxing, the sound of waves throwing music to ears and collection of shells, a joyous experience.Suggested visit to the beach to enjoy an ice-cream (sold way over the MRP) is a treat in itself.Preferred suggested time to visit is - early morning - around sun-rise or late evening - around sun-set.Enjoy the sea , a tad away from central beach to enjoy the loneliness and feel nature."
The varca beach is one of the calm and serene beaches in goa! Has an amazing view and is very peaceful! A must visit!
"This beach is clean and reasonably shallow so that we can bath there safely. Conpared to other beaches the crowd is less and this makes it more attractive.Do try some fish delicacies from the nearby shacks However the costs of these shacks seems to on the higher side.There are activities like paragliding, jet skiing etc."
The best and cleanest beach in Goa.  Loved the vast flat expanse. The crystal clear water.  The beach sports and the extremely alert expert life guards.  We even saw them rescue a tired swimmer. The water is so clear that you can see the hermit crabs and star fishes clearly. No trash on this beach. In other words it's the best.
Varca is one of the cleanest beach I have found in South Goa. The beach is big and you can have a really good introspective morning walk here if you have your head full of thoughts and want to think through...it’s so quiet and peaceful....as you walk along the beach you can reach Zuri resort and the Mahindra club which also have a good beach front but the stretch at Varca has less crowd so that’s the spot you should spend in the morning. Try to go a bit and early since the sun comes up early and it can be quite hot even in the morning. There are some beach sports which you can find on the beach stretch towards Colva
"Varca Beach is the one of the Cleanest beach in the South Goa. Clean and Crystal Clear water. Always enjoy my visit to Varca Beach visited many time but witnessed the sun set this time and it was beautiful. Radish Colour of the Sea and Clouds during sunset was the real beauty. Lots of Visitors from the hotels like Caravel Beach Resort, Zuri White Sand and Taj Exotica. During peak season there will be water activities like Water Boat Ride,  Hot Balloon Ride and lot more activities. Do visit to enjoy the Beauty and those all activities."
"Awesome holiday of the caravela beach resort with family nice staff with the smile and helpful.   The great part of their food and service. I wanted to mention the name from room service Mr Abinash, Mario and Niranjan etc.and the chef Paul.   From housekeeping Nice way they introduce their self staff like biswajit, satish. They always taken a charge for cleaning the room when ever I asked. Thank you caravela beach resort once again that's my second time"
"Varca beach is a Big Beautiful and Broad Beach with white powdery sand. It is not overcrowded like some other south Goa beaches because of limited accessibility. One of the access points is the road abutting Zuri White Sands Beach Resort.  Be aware that you have to climb a small sandy hillock to gain access to this beach from here. Not advisable for people with limited mobility. Once on the beach, it is a haven for sunbathers. Very few spots with any shade. However there are the usual shacks with umbrellas and beach chairs for hire."
"Neat, clean and beautiful. Enjoyed one evening with family, my husband, son and daughter.  beautiful beach with white sand."
"Stayed at sterling varka. Visited varka beach. Comparatively Clean, clean water.no haukers, no noise pollution.well must visit beach in Goa."
"Even in this rainy season where the weather disturbances are at its peak, this beach is serene and beautiful. Definitely worth a visit with outdoor gaming etc. avoid slightly deeper seas as per weather for can never ever take a chance with Mother Nature."
Beach at Club Mahindra Varca beach is a mesmerizing atmospheres during these rainy days.Sound of heavy sea waves associated with wind just keep you nailed for hours.Best part the Beach is so clean and with limited crowd adds up touch of class.Life guards keeping watch on activity keep check on going overboard. Walking on the stretch of white sand a great exercise in morning and evening so you can enjoy Fish Beef Pork dishes without any guilt.
"Really clean beach. Not crowded at all. Fine white sand. Awesome for kids- we spent hours there. Cosmos eating shack was wonderful too. So, we ordered breakfast and then went to feel the water on our feet. Came back when the food arrived. Really enjoyed the calm of the beach."
"Enjoyed our stay at Varca beach - club Mahindra resorts,  Goa. Enjoyed our vacation, just in the resorts.  Will visit again.  A nice resort to get away from our city life and routine."
"It's one of the cleanest beaches with white sand and a good beach, kind of a secluded beach not really crowded. Have 1 or 2 shacks ok types. Nearby located is Sterling, Zuri White Sands and Club Mahindra resorts."
"White sand , little crowd which was very nice. No hawkers to trouble you. Got a chance to see some fishermen pulling in their catch early morning. No beach shacks and a few stray dogs were the drawback.."
"A good, clean shallow beach in south Goa. Has guards who keeps warning people who venture out far into the seas. This is a simple beach and does not have any restaurant attached to it. So pl carry food and water if you intend to spend a lot of time. There are also few sales agents distributing coupons of a neighbouring resort (it’s not Club Mahindra-it’s a different one and can’t remember the name). Pl do not participate in the event as there are stories of harassment."
"Uncrowded, easily accessible with safe parking options. Clean, unpolluted stretched with lifeguard. Need to check rules regarding going out some distance into the sea to swim - fussy supervisors keep whistling you back. Maybe need to assure them you can swim if you want to venture out. Speedboat rides available."
"Located at 900 meters from our hotel, the beach was at walking distance. Visited the beach at couple of times during our stay at different times. The beach is quite clean and well maintained. However there are no shacks or anything which makes Goa beaches more fun."
"Of all the beaches we have been in Goa, this is one of the cleanest. Was less crowded and we have very peaceful walks."
"We had a great time at the beach at it was adjacent to our resort. Being the rainy season, the seas were a bit rough but the breeze and the lack of crowds made it a serene experience."
"Refreshing and revitalising. Walking on the beach amidst limitless sky, bonding with family and breathing in fresh air was so mesmerising. Soulful!!!"
Stayed at Caravella Beach Resort and walked from Varca Beach down to Cavelossim on a couple of days.  The beach at Varca is very quiet and clean.  Lovely !  Would definitely recommend
"Having had trysts with North Goan beaches during most past visits, choosing South Goa this time was purposeful, and are we glad we did! Varca beach is a sight to behold... white, soft sands leading to a relatively calm see that allows you to swim into the moderately sized waves, and lined with just enough number of shaded beach-beds, you can spend hours here without a thought. The Caravela resort offers two shacks providing interesting cocktails and fresh sea-food, which adds to the charm. Water-sport options are available - although without the hassle of people forcing you to go parasailing or jet-skiing. You are free from the nagging tattoo makers, masseurs and hawkers trying to see you anklets & beads - multiple beaches will offer you these, in case you were interested - but Varca isn't one of them. If you're looking to simply chill out, and while-away your time while watching the sea and sipping on exotic cocktails, Varca is the place to be!"
"Less than a KM away from the Resort.Empty road leading to the beach. Hardly any traffic. Very very hot, we went to the beach about 11.00 am. Profusely sweating. No trees to give shade. Nice plants (wild) along the way. Saw a huge green cactus plant, a few lotus floating, The beach was empty naturally we were there at a wrong time. Too hot,"
