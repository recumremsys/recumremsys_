This is a great place to visit. A very efficient ferry service takes you there. Runs every 10 minutes. Nice monument. Not ancient. Was built in the 20th century
"Visited this place in summer. Nice Place to Visit a ferry ride for 10-15 minutes is little difficult to get due to long queue  and local persons are trying to jump the queue and want to reach in front of ferry ride as the queue is too long. Again queue management is in sufficient.When you reach Rock Memorial your all the impetiance will be over you will fill cool, calm and peace everywhere. Three seas are merging around and you will fill the colors of the Magnitude and Diversity of the place. You will feel the thrill, 125 years ago in 1892 December 25 how Swami Vivekananda did meditation here in this this rock. I am really astonish & speechless when I was in Rock Memorial. Really the environment is excellent, incredible.  Nice books & presentation are available in very reasonable price in 06 books stalls. One thing you need to remember that you have to visit this Rock memorial and surrounding areas in barefoot. As I visited this place in first week of June during returning time, (around 11:30 am afternoon) we felt the heat in the floor of the memorial compound area. There is a special entry ticker for the ferry is also available for Rs.200/- per person to bypass the queue.It’s a lifetime achievement for anyone to see the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari."
Vivekanad Rock Memorial is Amazing. You can go their by ferries only. You can buy tickets. Lot of people visit this place. Aamzing experience.You can take your time exploring the place. Sit down at the meditation room and meditate for a while. Very well maintained.
Place is beautifully located. Have to go by ferry which charges 34/ per head. It's a 5 min ride. The ferry offloads there and takes people coming back. Architecture is marvellous. Can see the 2 seas and indian ocean surrounding you on three sides. Nothing to eat there. Toilets are available. Book shops are there. Thiruvalluvar statue is nearby on another rock which is 133 feet high. Must go place.
Going to and fro to this place is a big headache considering the huge number of tourists and limited boats. Better go for the costly ticket (Rs 200) to avoid queues. Once you reach the place its a good place to be. View is excellent.
"One needs to complete a boat ride, which is thrilling, to reach this rock memorial. No food is allowed, drinking water is available. There is a hall for meditation. Books and other souvenirs can be bought from the shops. Have to wait 2-3 hrs during holidays to get into the boat."
"go by boat, what an experience, beautiful, stunning. an experience that is a must in this town. wow, wow ,wow"
"If you travelling down south in India, this is the farthest one can go. Take a boat ride to visit the Vivekananda rock memorial. Enjoy a roller coaster boat ride as the sea ia always choppy here. Next to it is the Kanyakumari temple."
"Certainly worth the boat ride to visit this memorial, the backdrop is stunning and it’s also lit up at night. Don’t go when it’s raining! It’s slippery and there is not much shelter to get out of the rain with the hoards."
"This iconic place in TN is a great place to visit. The rock memorial in the sea can be reached by a motor boat operated by TN government for a round trip of 50₹. Depending on the crowd waiting time can be considerable and plan accordingly trip timings. The memorial is a peaceful place with all round oceanic views and Kanyakumari shoreline. A statue of Vivekananda inside the memorial and a silent meditation hall, a Parvathi footprint temple and a library,museum and book shops are located in the premises"
Ferried by launch. Beautiful and scenic place. The extraordinary sight of the sea from the place is the highlight.  The main memorial is great with explanation coming from the guard inside. The place is discipline and memorable. There are tickets which are nominally priced. Don't miss it
Visited it in Feb 2019. Ride to the memorial is adventurous as we faced high tides and thus extra care has to be taken of kids. Awesome place with a great view of the Kanyakumari town. A beautiful and peaceful place to spend good time. One must also visit Kanyakumari Temple.
Amazing Place and don't miss this boat ride to Vivekananda Rock Memorial if you are visiting to Kanyakumari. Make sure you have this place on you do list of must visit list. They will ask you watned Rs 50 or Rs 200 for the boat ride and I would go with Rs 50 and there is not special with Rs 200 becaues everyone will have to wait for same boat.
A must visit spot with family. Enjoy the boat trip followed by the beautiful view and peaceful ambiance of the monument. Don't miss a small session in the meditation hall which will show you path towards inner happiness and peace of mind. Enjoyed every moment....
"Its amazing place at the seaside. Rising Sun & Sun set is unbelievable, This is really a Goddess place."
"Located at the southernmost point of mainland India, provides a very good view of both sunrise and sunset. Such a serene place. Very cleanly maintained. Approach is through 5 minutes boat ride which costs 50₹ and special ticket costs 200₹. You get to jump the queue while going but no special services on return. Boat accommodates almost 100 people. Superb one of the best places to visit at Kanyakumari. It's an island where cool breeze flows throughout the day, you just need to sit in an shaded area. You won't like to move from that place, feels like spending the entire day sitting and relaxing. It gives you a peace of mind and relaxes your body.There is a meditation hall inside it and visitors can meditate there. Inside the meditation hall, the only sound is of OM.. and it's a good experience."
"The Vivekananda memorial is in a huge rock island just 500 meters from the shore . There is a ferry service which runs continuously to ferry people.As a visitor who has made multiple visits at different months, time of day, weather conditions, your experience may vary from just another overrated, overcrowded tourist place to an awesome experience depending upon when you visit. Recommend to visit during a weekday morning (when there are no school holidays) for best experience.Would like to split the review/experience into the Ferry service & Memorial. Ferry Service : All throughout the walk way/road leading to the ferry ticketing place is commercialized. It is 50Rs for normal ticket/person & 200 for VIP ticket (just lets you skip the queue to get the tickets during crowded days). During holiday season the wait time at the queue can be as high as 3-4 hours to get the tickets (standing in the sun) and wait for the Ferry. The ferry ride is a great experience, very bumpy and scary. Just to get in and out of the ferry itself seem dangerous when the tides are rough. Unnecessary rush by people at times to get a window side seat. Ferry doesn't operate if the tides are high. The life jackets provided are dirty. Funny to see each one is handling it the way they like. Memorial Rock : There is an entry fee (20Rs). Also, You have to deposit your foot wears to the caretaker at the entrance and walk bare foot all around. The rock can get very hot in the afternoons, though there are places where there is a layer of painting done to keep it cool. The memorial rock has multiple halls (Mandapam as it is called) Vivekananda mandap/hall has his life sized statue. The Shripada mandap has a foot print on the rock (behind a closed enclosure in the middle of the hall), supposed to be of a Goddess. And a Dyana Mandap for meditation where there is great silence and OM being chanted continuously. The outer areas give a great view of the seas (remember this place is the junction of the 3 seas (Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea). The view of the sea waves crashing at the rocks are awesome. The cool breeze and strong winds gives an amazing feel. There are decks to see the sun rise and sun set, the sun calender is etched in a granite pedestal. Excellent photo ops all around. Great view of the Thiruvalluar (Tamil Saint Poet) statue (133 feet) in the nearby rock island. All these great experience may go for a toss when there is too much crowd and noise/rush around. There are couple of shops to buy any memorabilia/books.  Carry water if you are not used to drinking from the public water taps. There is toilet/rest rooms available. One can spend as much time as possible at this place and the ferries run continuously till the closing time 6 PM IST. There can be queue/wait times for ferry return too. Have an awesome experience !"
"Visited the memorial in mid August. It's a must do if one is in Kanyakumari.Tips:1) Take the 200 Rs ticket and skip the queue while heading to the memorial. The queue can get really long on weekends.2)The water can be fairly rough so the ferry ride (although short) may not be smooth. The ferry keeps shaking even when it's docked so boarding, alighting can be a challenge if traveling with small kids or elderly"
Built in 1970 and just off the shore accessible by ferry boat. This temple still memorial is beautiful and has a very peaceful meditation room. It really is a must see.
It's always memorable to visit this divine place. Has been going there since my college days and it is always pleasant to be there. A feast for eyes and mind.
"Must for anyone visiting Kanyakumari. Getting a ticket after standing in a long waiting queue is difficult but ince you have the ticket then the experience is worth. The normal ticket queue was quite long but the special ticket queue was not small even. Holiday season needs to be avoided. The massive waves makes the ferry ride even more interesting. One can imagine the power and strength of Sri Vivekananda ji, who made is way by swimming from shore that rock. The place was very clean and well maintained. Must for all and highly recommended."
I don't have enough word to explain the beauty and value of Vivekanada Rock. Boating service available from kanyakumari. 20 rupees ticket need by in the rock.it will take around 1 hour to visit the complete area. Don't miss the meditation room and obviously the beauty  of ocean. 
"Surrounded by oceans this small rock will give you positive vibes and calmness. And, moreover it feels great to put a check-in from the last point of India !"
"summary:day1: 10hr drive with very nice roads and sunset point visitday2: kanyakumari temple darshan, ferry ride and vivekananda rock, trisea sangam point, Padmanabhapuram Palace, Sothavilai Beachday3: sunrise, Vattakottai Fort, rameshwaram drive of 5 hours and famous Ramanathaswamy temple darshanday4: Ramar Patham darshan, dhanushkodi beach point, Panchamukha hanuman temple darshan, Dr APJ Abdul kalam memorial visit, Villoondi Tirtham, khushi beachday5: drive back to bangalore recently we did trip  from bangalore to kanyakumari to rameshwaram and back, as our plans of going to kerala on the extended long weekend were washed away in the floods. though its a really long drive, if you pace it out, its very enjoyable, even with kids, but would need like 5 days atleast to do justice to the 660+ km drive.we started out early morning, 6 am, and could really beat the bangalore traffic, though the toll plaza was already seeing a crowd (btw its a royal wastage of time and money (for fuel burnt) and just filling up someone's pocket, as the broken roads of bangalore dont deserve any toll for the few km its motroable). in comparison the roads of TN are like butter, you can easily do 120-130 without even noticing - awesome roads all the way till Kanyakumari. Though the toll is 710 rs (more than re a km) and all intersections in some cities have barriers to slow you down. with a couple of pit stops for breakfast, lunch, we still made it in approx. 10 hrs.the sunset is awesome, and after taking short rest in hotel, we went to sunset point, which was 2km away, since we reached 30min early, easy parking and could enjoy the area before actual sunset. came back and had dinner at sarvana hotel (pricey and not much tasty btw) and retired for the day.interesting part is folks all over the visit speak hindi so fluently, that sometimes i had to remember the hindi words :), business teaches everyone all the languages...wanted to go to see the sunrise, but too tired and did not wake up on time for the 6.12 am sunset. whole family took bath and set off for darshan at Bhagavathy Amman Temple, which is walkable from our hotel, we had a very good darshan in the special queue (though temple was empty the folks pushed us to that entrance), Goddess nosepin is so shiny it will blind you. Men will be asked to remove shirt/banyan in inner portion of temple.returned for breakfast and changed to shorts and tshirt and set off for ferry ride to vivekananda rock. ticket is 50rs pp, even kids above certain height, but crowd was less so no wait, ferry fills in few hundred or so folks and there are 2-3 rotating, probably when crowded. ferry takes like 10min (most of it is parking time) to reach vivekananda point. its a pity they dont go to thiruvalluvar statue rock or that both rocks should at least be linked..nice views at the rock, it gets hot, so take some pics and headed back. walked to the trisea sangam, another 5-10 min walk after having lot of coconut water, took few pics and admired the 3 colours of the oceans (Indian ocean, Bay of bengal, Arabian sea) and it got quite hot, so had lunch and headed back for rest.since it was too hot and Temples are closed till 3/4pm, we headed off to Padmanabhapuram Palace first, rather than Thanumalayan temple - Sthanumalayan Kovil, google showed an hour, but traffic was high and few road stoppages, meant we took additional 40min. This wooden palace is really awesome, it looks small but its huge inside. we had to remove footwear and kept on walking for more than an hour to cover it. each room has a person who can talk in multiple languages to explain the significance. we were tired in the end, had snacks and decided toskip Mathur aqueduct, as i did not feel like driving more.we headed to Sothavilai Beach, which is on the way back for us, and about 10km from the kanyakumari beach and we reached there in an hour. the beach is nice, empty (hardly saw 1 or 2 folks till eye could go), but the tides/waves are very strong, so we just ran little bit in water, played around for some time.in the evening went to ""delhi punjabi dhaba"" - there are several punjabi ones, so note the name, the north indian food, which kids were missing now, was awesome, great service, very nice buttermilk..then we shopped around for shells products..with decent bargaining ofcourse.next morning at 6 stepped out on foot to see the sunrise, 10min walking distance and reached just on time to see the 6.15 awesome sunrise, with quite a crowd - some viewing from hotel roof. had breakfast, packed and setoff at 8.30 to Vattakottai Fort, in 10min we came to empty fort, its a small one, very neat and clean and AWESOME views of the ocean, we sat on the wide walls and took selfies and enjoyed the ocean view before driving off to Rameshwaram.5 hours or so, we reached the hotel, had lunch, packed up in preparation for the 22 well bath and darshan of the famous  Ramanathaswamy temple. Please read my review there to get the details, else this one will become multi-page :)went around the temple, had dosas and retired for the day.after sumptuous breakfast, we headed first to Ram Padam (ramar patham) shrine from where Lord Ram started his journey for Lanka. its the highest point and so views are nicethen we headed off to dhanushkodi, its awesome with ocean on both sides and the narrow road in between, at the end is where we can park car and go to the ocean. there is also a nice temple in between.we then headed to Panchamukha hanuman temple, where kids got to see the floating stones, which looked to be huge corals, but float well on water. on the same road back to pamban bridge is Dr APJ Abdul kalam memorial, must see for all, he is a role model, a president to set an example to others, no words to describe such a great man, and hte memorial does justice by showcasing his pictures, medals, belongings etc a km away is Villoondi Tirtham (sweet water well in ocean) where legend has it that lord Rama shot an arrow in ocean to quench Sita's thirst. there is deep well and very nice ocean front.we then headed to Khushi/Ariyaman beach, which was slightly crowded but such a calm ocean with gentle slope, kids really had royal fun here as its like a huge swimming pool. we were done early evening with sand all over..worst part is the drive back to bangalore, when you know in advance that it will take 2+ hours from the last toll plaza to home on a rainy sunday evening with broken roads..so much disappointed with the roads in bangalore and apathy towards fixing. it took 11 hours from hotel to home...althought the distance was ~570 km"
Located on an island in the sea with beautiful views of the 2 seas and Kanyakumari from a distance. A ferry takes you to the monument. Would recommend taking a VIP ticket to skip the long queue. Must go if in Kanyakumari.
The family stayed at Kanyakumari in one of the sea side hotels. The aim was to see the sunrise and sunset at Kanyakumari. From there we made a trip to the Vivekananda Rock. For that you need to get a ferry. It's a big line to get a ticket for the ferry. So advisable to start early. Once you are at the rock you can return anytime. Rock offers  scenic beauty of the sea. Do visit and meditate at the meditation centre. Please carry adequate drinking water. Please ensure not to litter the place or throw litter into the Sea. Have a nice trip. Do visit once in lifetime .........
Very hot during summers. Boating ferry arrangements was poor especially queue management and ferry frequency.
Nice five minutes ferryLook at the foot print of the goddess Parvathi Be enchanted by the massive statue of Swami Vivekananda Must go to the dhyana mandapam which is the most serene place on the rock. Spend five minutes of nothingness thereRefreshed look at the views around and back in a ferryReally content
Vivekanand rock memorial is a must visit place in Kanyakumari. Travelling in a motor boat to Vivekanand rock memorial is a lifelong memory.
Had an amazing experience at Vivekananda Rock memorial in Kanyakumari. Ticket for ferry ride is 50 Rs per person and it gets open from 8.30 am till 4 Pm IST .   You get amazing feeling when you see India from Rock memorial it's nice feeling
Clean and calm place. Spell bound experience viewing the sea side and inside the temple. It gives a spiritual feeling
"Must see place at kanyakumari Well maintained and kept cleanVivekananda Rock Memorial is a popular tourist monument in Vavathurai, Kanyakumari, India. It was built in 1970 in honour of Swami Vivekananda who is said to have attained enlightenment on the rock. According to local legends, it was on this rock that Goddess Kumari and vivekananda performed austerity.Their is s ferry provided by government at a very minimum fee to take you to the island and back from the island"
Be very clear in mind. Kanyakumari is only about Godess's temple. You must go there with offering your prayer. Very holy place indeed. The two rocks on the sea next to Kanyakumari temple are new structures.  One that is call Vivekananda Rock is a tourist spot developed encasing the name of Swamy Vivekananda a nice statue inside having more prominence than Shri Ram Krishna and ShriMa. No puja artis are done. It is a propaganda joint of a socio political group who pushes people in to a room saying to help knowing Swamy Vivekananda but inside do just the opposite only talk about themselves and ask for charity. It's like given to write an essay on cow you go on writing all about the village where the cow also is found.Yes it is a nice place to enjoy the sea and take selfies. For me Swamyji is very different I cannot tolerate anyone undermines his stature for self propaganda. And no puja and arti for Sri Ramkrishna and ShriMa is a great insult to our belief. These are the people who are heartbroken for not been able to build Ram temple.My suggestion must visit but only for fun.
"Be prepared to stand in a long queue under the hot sun to buy boat tickets, especially during holidays. The rock has the meditation point of Swami Vivekananda, meditation room, the southernmost point of the Indian peninsula, sunrise positions marked on a rock, etc. Worth a visit."
"Standing at the southern tip of India , when you look at this wonderful monument , you would realise that it’s totally worth the travel. Skipping to the tips I can offer : plan to reach by evening . Note that the last ticket is sold at 4 pm , but you can stay there until the last ferry . Evening are cooler and winds are strong . You would love it there . Sat and Sun reach around 3 as the queue can be longer . Once the sun provides you the golden light , it’s best to take your wide angle shots . I liked it more from the Thiruvalluvar statue , which provides a even wider view . The ferry route includes Vivekananda memorial as the first point and then proceeds to Thiruvalluvar statue and back to starting point. You have to take off shoes at both monuments . No photography is allowed inside the halls . You can photograph outside .Ferry charge per person : 50 Entry Ticket per person : 20 Toilets are available at both monuments .Food is not allowed .Birding : you might get some waders and terns around this place.Hope this helps ."
