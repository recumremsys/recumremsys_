When you visit the sight you will see many heroes and the tragic loss of life.  This is a very humbling experience and should be viewed as such.  There are many personal items on display and one section that you are asked not to film or photo graph.  Be respectful at all times because you don't who is visiting the memorial and could be grieving the loss of a loved one.  It is amazing that there were not more lives lost.  After visiting the memorial never forget what you have seen and don't take your daily life for granted.
This is a must see for everyone.  It is worth a trip to NYC just to go to this museum.  Allow at least 4 hours to see everything.
"Very well laid out.  Expect to spend more time than you think inside the museum.  So much to look at and read and absorb the immense loss of life that occurred there. The amazing job the curators did shows in how everything is presented and displayed.  To everyone who had a part in getting this planned and implementing the reality I commend your courage, persistence and gratitude.  Do not visit the city without this visit.  Please visit the memorial fountains outside too.  Very loving tribute to those that lost their lives that day."
"You will need at least 3/4 hours to go around the museum to hear,see & listen to everything, It's very moving, especially the photos of people jumping. Take your time & give it the respect it deserves."
"A truly powerful place. Prior online booking allows you to pass the long queue. Don't be lured by bracelet offered for donation: near the exit, there's a visitor center with lots of merchandise. A must-visit."
Used the free audio guide tour. The museum is quite good and great for following up with all the 9/11 information most of the people got from the media around the world.The tour is really useful and practical to guide you along the way.
"Visited this museum twice now on 2 separate trips to NYC, such an emotive place and really hits home how horrific the events of that day must have been. This will forever be remembered in history, and therefore I took my son with me who is 12, he really was so fascinated and learnt so much about the history of these events. There are areas where cameras are allowed and areas where they are not. This museum takes a few hours to get round but is so worth taking the time to do this.Definitely a must do on anyone's NYC itinerary."
Don’t be put off by thinking this is an emotional experience it was truly an amazing museum. We paid around $45 for the audio tour well worth it so you know what you are looking out and story behind it. Arrived at 9am to no queue and venue has a cafe as well and cloakroom is free to store heavy winter jackets and rucksacks (note that I had a thermal on and top and was quite cool walking around). Young lady who took us around was very informative and explained about everything well worth the extra as otherwise don’t think the exhibits tell you much.  8 of us on the tour all felt it was well worth the extra.  This tour was just inside though you can pay to be shown around the outside too but we did 9/11 survivors museum tour where an actual person affected by that day takes you round $35 and Chris our guide was on the 82nd floor in North Tower when the first plane crashed into 93rd floor. Anyway back to the museum.  After the guided tour you make your own way into the story of 9/11 about the whole day from start to finish including the terrorists and people who lost their life’s and the lessons learnt from terrorist attack in 1993.  Very very interesting. Also a bit about rescue dogs but we didn’t do that as 3 hrs in we had read enough.   If you carry on outside the museum past ohares Irish bar and keep walking the survivors museum is 5 min walk on right hand side great deli opposite for lunch or breakfast and cake.
"A very moving & heart Braking too see & walk around, the silence is eerie & the experience overwhelming. One minute your in the busy city streets then around the corner is 9/11. The north & south pool's with everyone's name, too walk around then there's the museum. Use the official cloakroom too store your hats & coats taking time too walk around & take everything in & remember, never forget 9/11"
"Went here with again pass,queues not too bad (time of year).The exhibitions are all very powerful as to helping us non Americans try to understand just how bad that day was. It is all presented very respectfully to all the fallen and their families.I found it all very moving.The 2 pools on the site of the towers are absolutely stunning and a wonderful memorial to the people lost that day.Well worth a visit ."
"Amazing museum!!! There is so much to look at, listen to, read. We spent four hours walking and looking around, and could have easily spent much more time. It is eery, yet eye opening to walk through a museum focused solely on an event that you have lived through. Seeing all of the details played over from that day is an humbling experience. I highly recommend visiting early in the morning, it gets crowded fast. We arrived at opening and thirty minutes later, there were 20 people surrounding each exhibit. Plan to spend a little extra time due to crowds, there is so much to see and do."
"If you do anything in New York, go here. It makes you stop and think. Allow enough time as it is on different levels. The only down side , which sounds petty is the cafe could be larger. Please go and see this museum."
"Each of us should take the time to visit this site...we will be reminded of what people really encountered that day who worked, lived in the area or came to help.  The impact on each of us is presented, and the changes that powerfully changed our history as a nation and the world.  It takes time to go through it, and much of it is startling.  Shows a tragic day and how it would affect all the days following."
"Walked all through the financial district, but this was the most meaningful spot for me. Very moving to be in such a hallowed space."
"Third time we have been to the Memorial, this time specifically to see the new  exhibit about the hunt and eventual end of Bin Laden. Well worth the admission even if  you have been to the Museum before. Doing the ""skip the line"" ticket is the easiest way and there are discounts for Military, Vets and Seniors."
i went there and the place is absolutly amazing. very emotional and lots of interesting facts. lines went fast. brings back a lot of memories
Very impressive to get a impression of what people must have been through that terrible day and far beyond.Alle those personal stories are heartbreaking . One that struck me most was the story of the fire truck that is half melted. Listen to the story that's behind...
"We took our teens on a visit to NYC and visited. Powerful, beautiful, desperately tragic and a great visual story of 9/11. We all learned so much and felt the tragedy and loss. Thank you."
There are two lines.  Buy your ticket online and only wait in one line.  You can spend many hours if you read all the signs and listen to all the talks.   Very nicely done.   Rooms were very crowded at times making it hard to get close to areas.
"Spent an afternoon here with the family. Very sad to see all the remains of the twin towers and people’s belongings. You hear tapes of the last phone calls and see posters of the missing people. Lots to see, would recommend."
This was something I have wanted to do for years. This year for my birthday we were able to go. It was definitely worth every second I've waited. It brought tears and made you remember why your a proud american! Seeing the remains and memorial was surreal. I recommend seeing it both day and evening.
Try to visit this memorial without getting emotional.  A beautiful tribute to an incredibly horrific event
Visiting the 9 / 11 museum/ memorial was highly emotional. The exhibits expose you to the horrific event and the heroics of so many people. You will truly never forget your visit.
Visiting this museum made me feel as if I was reliving the day again. Really felt a massive sense of lost but I would say that if you visit New York City and don’t visit here you’ll be missing out. The museum is absolutely amazing is all I’m trying to say.
"This place is haunting, captivating, humbling and truly amazing. Words cannot express how powerful this tour is. Do not skip this on your NYC visit!"
"Having watched the events unfold on television, this was top of the list of things to do in New York City.  We arrived at the ticket office quite early, but there was still a queue, though this did move quickly.  I was amazed by how wonderful and respectful this memorial was to not only the event itself, but to the lives lost in this tragedy.  There were plenty of police officers on duty to ensure everyone's safety and to protect the memorial.  Well done to those who created this and to the volunteers throughout the memorial who give incredible insights into the events of the day.  Be prepared to be moved by your visit."
"The whole area of ground zero has been preserved and rebuilt in such a tasteful way to honour the victims. I was moved to tears both outside amongst the locations of the towers and throughout the museum. Out of respect I felt I couldn't take any photos within the museum. To me it wasnt a tourist destination for selfies and poses and memories, but a time to remember that fateful day and the horrors that America went through, particularly New York. Seeing items belonging to victims and damaged vehicles and pieces of buildings brought the images I saw in 2001 to life. I cried that day and I'm not ashamed to say, I cried all the way around that museum. Sadly some people were disrespectful, one man stood on a bench (a surviving one from the plaza) to take a photo. The staff quietly asked him to get down. Unfortunately, likes and shares have created selfishness in people. I wouldn't have a go at anyone taking photos down there but some forget that this place is basically a mass grave. I would recommend a visit and dont be ashamed to get upset. It's amazing how many people were. The only part of the museum I refused to acknowledge was the part about the terrorists. I did not care about any information about them. I understand why it was there and I have no complaint. But to me, it didnt deserve my time. Thank you to all involved to make this museum. You did a fantastic job in honouring the lives lost."
"Such an emotive experience. I’m humbled at the things I read, and saw.  Thank you for the reminder, of the attack but also the fortitude and resilience from New Yorkers."
"Visited Ground Zero and a little sceptical as to what it would be like but very impressed with the experience. It brought back the memories of the day. It was tastefully done, the right balance of informative, thought provoking and spiritual.  Give yourself a few hours but also recognise that for those that did not remember the day (albeit from the office in the UK) it may not have a lot of meaning - but like the WW1 memorials - it should and the museum and whole ground zero experience should help share those memories with the next generation"
"To be honest we weren’t sure whether to go to Ground Zero.  Did we want to go and see the site of so much destruction and misery?   Of course it is a chilling place but we are pleased that we did go and see it.   It was a moving and appropriate memorial.   What brought it alive was the guide we had who told us stories of individual acts of heroism.   To be honest, I don’t think you can comprehend a vast number of people passing but you can comprehend one person such as Todd Beamer on Flight 93.   Seeing his name and being reminded of his story bought tears to my eyes."
Such a powerful and emotive memorial. Bring your tissues with you for when (not if) you shed a tear or two. This is a must to visit when you are in NYC and your respects to those who lost their lives on the day that changed the world forever.
"Seeing the memorial brings back memories and explanations to my sin, who was a baby at the time of the attacks. Am glad for us to have gone, painful as it was."
"Like many others across the world I knew exactly where I was when this dreadful tragedy happened. Going to New York and visiting here to pay my respects to people that I didn't know or had no connection with was just an absolute necessity. Lots of people milling around in the quiet contemplative environment. I didn't listen to the final recordings of people, I just felt that it would be too upsetting. Well worth a visit to celebrate the survivors, the grit of the New Yorkers and the heroism of the emergency workers. Expect to shed a tear - I certainly did."
"get there as early as you can.  get your tickets in advance.  be prepared with comfy shoes.  you may need tissue as well.  if you were alive on that day-it will all come back to you.....if you were not, you will witness a very sad terrifying moment in USA history.  Be prepared"
A very moving experience. Seeing all the names of those who tragically lost their lives in this horrific event. What is noticeable is how quite it is just walking around the memorial. Never let us forget
