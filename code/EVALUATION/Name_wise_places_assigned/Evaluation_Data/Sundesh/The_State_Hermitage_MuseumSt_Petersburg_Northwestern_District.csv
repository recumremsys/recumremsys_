Several Rooms and Paintings.Sculptures as well as icons. Loved the outer pillars. Humanoid structures supporting the roof.
"We visited in winter, it was easy accessible. The winter palace surrounded by snow was magical!  Chilly outside, so make use of the cloakrooms. This is a vast museum, residence and art collection in one!Think Versailles&Louvre in one breath! Allow yourself enough time to admire. The floors, walls, ceilings, light fittings, curtains, and then there is art! Remember the BC collection on the ground floor... it is mind boggling to see that great artifacts are part of this collection. But after a few hours in here, vodka and comfort food is a must!"
"Couldn’t imagine the wealth of items inside its walls! Beautifully presented.with respect to their history everyone should visit! Use the audio guide as it helps a lot! Impressive, regal and unique! Give it ample time, then go opposite to see the paintings and around the corner to see Peter the firsts home, all with the same ticket!"
"Great city, great architecture. Worth visiting for 100%. Feeling you will have staying on the Palace square are impossible to describe. Need to come and to try. The Hermitage inside is one of the world masterpieces."
You cannot visit St. Petersburg without seeing the Hermitage.  You can spend all day touring the large museum or like us getting our tickets at 4:30 when it closes at 6 and run through with a map and see the highlights.  Not expensive to tour. Different options.  Loved it.
The Hermitage provides many workds of art that one only ready about. The museum is so massive to really take it all in you need several days (maybe weeks) to tour and appreciate. It is also crowded so be prepared to walk at a shuffle in many part but that is okay since there is so much to see.  Be sure to have a map so you can find your way out.  Best advise is to slow down and take in all of the sights.  A guide book or app for the Hermitage would proove helpful  I ail go again and again and again.
"The grand facade of the Hermitage Museum along with the Tsar's Winter Palace built on the huge expanse of the Palace Square is the most majestic icon of St Petersburg, Russia. Situated on the embankment of river Neva on one side, this a place which no tourist can afford to miss.The building complex comprises of the Winter Palace of the erstwhile royals, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage,  New Hermitage and Hermitage Theatre, which are usually frequented by the tourists.This is the second biggest museum of art collections after Louvre in Paris.The collections run into millions. One gets mesmerized looking at the exquisite paintings and art works by the masters.Going through the entire museum complex gallery after gallery can easily take a whole day."
"Feels impossible to see the whole collection in one day. We spend 3 hours just visiting the Dutch artist hall and then some highlights like the golden clock.It would probably take days to see everything. To skip the lines, buy your tickets at one of the machines."
This is a definite must see when visiting St Petersburg. The vastness of how enormous & jam packed opulence is just jaw dropping. Wear proper walking shoes as this museum is really big with sooooooooo much to see. 3 levels of incredible artifacts so carefully taken care of. This will take you a full day to see. There is a coffee shop downstairs to take a break & if traveling with small children the bathrooms are all on the lower level & very far from most things. Prepare well. Navigate the various inter leading rooms with the numbers at the top of the doors so you can see where you are on the map so not to miss anything & also find the stairs to the different levels. The babushka’s are friendly with no English & try their very best to assist you. And incredible experience
"Is not only the building, the art inside, is the history, the surroundings, everything. You can spend at least one day inside, if you love art two. You can walk everyday, cross the river, stay at the front and talk with locals"
"Nice museum, must see if you are visiting the city. In front of the museum there are few machines where you can easily get tickets and avoid unpleasant staff. I expected more. Building is amazing, I never seen so much marble and things from malachite. For me the building was more impressive than the museum exhibits. Two tips. First don’t count on the map. It’s extremely confusing. I saw almost all important museums in Europe and this one has the worse map ever. Don’t get surprised if you jump from room 15 to 129. Some rooms you can access just thru stairs and it’s not so obvious. Also it’s difficult to find room number. If you ask for help in English...well good luck. Second not everything is translated to English so if you are really interested in exhibition get an audiobook."
This is a great museum but overwhelming in size. We spent about 2 hours with our guide and we barely scratched the surface. There were tremendous crowds which made it hard and it is the end of the season! But definitely worth the trip. Don’t miss it.
"This is an unblievable collection of art, jewelry, Fabrege and pieces in an amazing building. The architecture outside is deceiving as it is almost plain compared to the interior. Room after room of  gold leaf, fantastic decorating, inlaid flooring and more. Don't miss it."
"This museum, aside form being located in an incredible palace of the Czars, has one of the largest collections of art, artifacts and other treasures from Imperial Russia. One of the main reasons for coming to St. Petersburg is to visit the Hermitage. Be aware that in the summer, it is incredibly crowded as the large cruise ships come in and the museum gets swamped with rage tour groups. Try going early upon opening or hiring a private guide."
"Visited the Hermitage museum and, as expected, it was busy but the groups were well controlled. The exhibits were wonderful but difficult to describe - worth a visit."
Did it with a private guide. So selected a few themes and history review ofPalace as well as Romanov .. fascinating.The exposed represent barely 8-10% of the Hermitage owned items...In the evening we followed up wit 2 hours in the vis a vis building with a treasure of paintings the Morozov collection (Monet/ Renoir/cezanne/ Gauguin/ Matisse/ Picasso)There is sooo much to see yet. A return is scheduled.
"So many exhibits to see at the Hermitage, that you need two days to really see the art work and all the other exhibits. Make sure that you have a translator for all the information  that you will need. You will run into many big tour groups."
"Numerous fantastic exhibits starting from ancient Egypt to 20 th century. European and Russian artist from all over the world are represented. The Winter palace itself is something magic. Art collection is on the par with Louvre. You need to spend there several days to fully appreciate the museum. Try to visit during European summer as the weather can be really bad. It can rain and be cold around 10 degrees Celsius, so warm clothes is a must even in summer. Allow at least a week in St.Petersburg to have a chance to visit other museums and enjoy magnificent city architecture. While nights from mid June to beginning of July is the best time to visit."
Everything was spectacular and our guide was fantastic. It helped that we got in 1.5 hours before it opened to the general public. So much to see. Need to go back to see more.
A definite must do!  Be prepared for a sensory overload.  The museum is situated in the Winter Palace and houses an outstanding collection of artworks.  The palace itself is so magnificent that it is a feature in itself and we found ourselves admiring the surroundings as much as the paintings and art works.  It is impossible to see all the exhibits in one visit but you get a good experience of the beauty and majesty of the place.
"Easily the most stunning museum I have ever been to, with such an impressive collection of state rooms, artefacts and amazing collections of paintings from all around the world. It was such a large collection, we felt ourselves getting lost multiple times! But most stunning. I recommend to book tickets online via the official website prior to your visit, and arrive with your printed ticket at least 25 minutes before opening time so you can experience the museum at leisure. Do plan your visit carefully and pay attention to opening hours and the weekly day off."
The main and the most important place to visit in Saint Petersburg in my opinion. Buy thickets online to avoid long queues and then you will find yourself immersed in the ocean of history of mankind since the beginning of the time. Be prepared for long visit.
"I had planned my St Petersburg visit around The Hermitage. Seeing The Hermitage was at the top of my list and everything else was secondary,Because I wanted as much time as possible in The Hermitage, I booked the five hours in The Hermitage with The Gold Room. The Hermitage was magnificent but the crowds were just out of control. There was so much chaos and mania that I fell down while going up a magnificent flight of marble stairs. The crowds ruined my visit and I was travelling the end of September, the so called shoulder season. I can not even imagine what it would be like during the season.It was difficult and sometimes impossible to hear my guide because there was so many groups and so much talking and noise Also,it was often difficult to get up close to the art work. I had originally booked an evening tour to The Hermitage but it was only three hours and I wanted as much time as possible so I changed my excursion. I regret the change.I suggest an evening visit to the Hermitage."
"If you travel to St Petersburg, this is the one thing you most not omit. Paintings, sculptures, furniture and other artefacts are just wow. The architecture, the fascade and everything tho! That is the best. Save the whole day for this amazing museum."
"You could spend days going through this Museum, The rich history represented there is beyond comprehension. Hire a guide it is worth it. The gold room has so much to see it gets boring. Unbelievable how close you can get to the art work."
Wear your walking shoes.  There is so much glitter and precious stones and ceiling art and endless rooms full of gold leaf and art that it is impossible to describe.  You can see some of it on Google Earth.
"We went early to have time to see as much as possible for one day. Since we went in December, there were not so many tourists. This was good because It probably is very busy during the high season. Cloakrooms are inside to hang coats and leave bags. There were at least two cafeterias inside to sit and relax after all the walking. The art is beautiful and if more information about the history of the art there is tour guides and also translation to learn more. Did not disappoint and warmly recommended as many others have done already!"
"The museum itself is wonderful. You can see anything about anything, and still have thousands of things to see. Our tour guide told us that if you spent 1 minute looking at each painting, you’d need 7 years! I highly recommend buying the St. Petersburg card. Not only does this grant you discounts at stores, but more importantly it allows you to skip the line and get museum tickets for free (depends on the museum). At the Hermitage for example, we didn’t have to pay extra AND we skipped the line. If you don’t have tickets, you’ll be waiting in a line for at least an hour. Be warned!There are a couple of cafes in the museum, but there aren’t many options (especially for vegans/vegetarians) and the food is overpriced. I’d recommend eating before you enter the museum."
Can't begin to explain the wonder of the Hermitage Museum. Similar to the Louvre experience. Be prepared for walking and climbing so dress comfortably. We visited in the summer so most of the rooms do not offer air condition. There was a line to get in confirming that this is a must visit on your St Petersburg to do list. Our tour director was very well versed and art appreciative so her vast knowledge was relied upon to explain the pieces of art and the various time periods in Russian history. Be prepared to be wowed and take in the wonder of The Hermitage.
"This is a great place! Take your ticket through the net or on the side you can find machine for tickets where you can buy cheaper ticket then inside . The most impressive museum I have ever seen.If you spent a minute on every piece , it would take you 11 years to look at everything ."
A must see stop in St. Petersburg. One of the most impressive and opulent palaces I have seen. Gets extremely crowded there fore I would recommend paying extra and going before regular hours.  Guided  tours are very helpful because of the size of the castle .... amber room is a must stop
"Indispensable visit of this musuem. Be prepared to see many rooms, all so nicely decorated, hosting great paintings from world famous artists."
"As everyone else has said, the exhibits at the Hermitage are truly mind blowing and world class.  We planned our visit with our excellent guide Nina (from Tzarina Tours, who organised the tickets so we basically just went straight in) for Wednesday afternoon so we could see the Peacock Clock.  I wanted to do a review just for the peacock clock but it doesn’t appear to be separated out on TA.  Would have only given it 2 stars.  After several hours with Nina covering the main exhibits, we went back at about 6.15pm to try to secure a good spot to see the peacock clock, considering that it was peak season in mid-June.  There was already a small crowd but we were able to secure a fairly close spot and then as time went on others got fed up and left and so we actually ended up in a prime spot right in front of the clock.  I had thought the clock was at 7.30pm but it turned out that it was not until 8pm, so it was a long wait for a large crowd.  But then when the time finally came and the man entered the enclosure to wind the clock and start the performance (which lasts about one minute), he crouched down to wind the clock but then stood up about ten seconds into the show, almost obliterating the view for anyone directly in front and ruining any photo opportunities.  Those on the side would have had a better view though.  Don’t know whether we just got a bad day or if this is normal.  But a nice touch was that they did allow small children to come and sit inside the ropes, so long as they didn’t touch the glass enclosure.So a long wait to have the view obscured – we would have been much better off using the time to view other exhibits in the museum.  If you want to see the clock in action, just get there 5 or 10 minutes early and you will probably see as much over the crowd as we did from right in front."
"The Hemitage is the Centre of attractions in St Peterburg. The architectural beauty, the historical narrative, the internal beauty and the art / artifacts collections will leave you most satisfied - maybe wanting more. I've been fortunate to visit this museum twice and would not mind a third visit too. It is a full day affair and should not be rushed. The summer months are too crowded, especially with bulk tours which can be noisy and overwhelming in a pristine place like this. Wear comfortable shoes. In case you're visiting in non-tourist months, you could have the place to yourself. A guide / e-audio guide are a must , else you miss out on the relevance of the displays."
Hermitage is one reason to visit St. Petersburg and is not just an incidental add on to a trip to St. Petersburg. Unfortunately I could only spend a whole day there... plan to visit again to spend atleast a week at Hermitage. Audio guides are available and are a must. The cafeteria is good too. Mesmerising collection and hugely informative and interesting for an art lover.
