"Some 388 years ago, Shah Jahan built this marvel to illustrate the adoration he held for his deceased wife. The result? A stunning structure nearing architectural perfection enjoyed by millions.On entering the complex, you are presented with the postcard perfect imagine of the Mahal in all its symmetrical brilliance, mystified by a veil of morning mist. The allocated three hour time slot affords plenty of time to enjoy the grounds and surrounding structures which are definitely worth a look albeit less grand than the main attraction. On approach, you are requested to remove your shoes/apply shoe covers to help preserve the white marble surround. This area offers the instagram enthusiasts a fantastic opportunity to capture that like conjuring selfie. For a small fee of around 200R you can enter the upper promenade and even go into the Mahal to observe the marble interior. Personally, after the grandness of the exterior I found the inside a little underwhelming but for the few minutes it takes to see it’s worth popping your head in. Walking around the exterior of this upper level definitely presents the best opportunity for you to appreciate the time and consideration given to it’s construction. With tickets costing 1250R (£13.50/$17.00) the excursion is certainly value for money.  Five stars doesn’t begin to do the experience justice."
"It is a monument by King Shajahan for his lovely wife Mumtaj, Built in AGRA on the banks of Yamuna. It took 22 years to complete the Monument. Made up of White Marbles.The stones fixed on the Marbles are from Afganistan, AFRICA, Belgium, and India, It is one of the Seven wonders of the Land. It will look in different colours when the sun shines, after sun set, and full moon day."
"Built as the final resting place for a favorite wife of a king, the Taj Mahal is simply stunning. You can't take a bad picture of the buildings and grounds. And if you're lucky, you'll see some monkeys to boot! If you are anywhere near the area, go!!! You'll be so glad you did."
"I visited the Taj Mahal 20 years ago and upon my recent 2nd trip, I wondered if I would be as mesmorized as I was the first time round. This time I was also taking my boyfriend who was seeing it for the first time so I was expectant and a little worried that I had over dramatised her impact. I needn't have worried, still she reveals herself to you in part as you walk through the entry gate and then WOW, my jaw hit the floor as did that of my boyfriend. It is a marvel, standing in all her glory, it is still the best architectural masterpiece I have ever seen. Perfectly symmetrical, built in ivory-white marble, this mausoleum is situated on the south bank of the Yamuna river. Take some time to walk around it and marvel at it the Taj in the different lights. Take a step back and you will see the beautiful parrots among the trees worshipping this little piece of heaven as if they know it is a famous monument that depicts love. This is a must visit, you will never forget this experience, it stays with you."
"What can one say about this famous monument and building? We have always wanted to see the Taj and were not disappointed. It is an amazing structure and the story behind it is also such a vital part of India’s history. Our group stayed at a nearby hotel which was only about 1.5 km flat walk to the Taj. We went late afternoon the previous day to a viewing area (by our small bus) to see the Taj at sunset – it gets very busy here so allow time to get a good place – standing or sit on a fence. Don’t miss the hordes of birds swooping and circling at sunset. Great photos! The main treat however is to rise early and walk from the hotel to the Taj for sunrise. You need tickets and one of our leaders went ahead and got the tickets as soon as they opened – it was still dark. The walk took about 15 minutes and we joined the queue forming to enter via the west gate. The first sight of the Taj is indeed amazing, the sunrises very quickly so do not be late – the colours and appearances change within minutes. The marble is almost translucent as it picks up the changing light. You have around 20-30 minutes and it is all over, take lots of photos. We had a guided tour which took about an hour and you learn the history, the intricacies of the building itself, the fact the minarets are on slight angles facing away from the Taj so in the event of an earthquake they would fall away from the beautiful building. You enter the tomb complex via a line that moves fairly quickly as you can walk past the final resting places of Shah Jahan and his wife, Mumtaz. You are not able to take photos within this area and unable to wear shoes here. There are good washroom facilities on site. The whole Taj experience took around 2 hours following which time we returned to the hotel for a hearty breakfast."
"When visiting the Taj Mahal it is easy to see why it is one of the seven wonders of the world. It is elegant , beautiful and is a unique ,architectural masterpiece located in Agra. We attended at 6:30 in the morning in the second week of March 2020.{ Note: Very few people are coughing or sick  in India !! LOL! All hotels we are staying at are temp. checking.!!] It should be noted that this monument is closed on Fridays for local Muslims to use for their own  religious activities. Entry was relatively easy, no crowds, just straight up to a ticket booth.We were given a bottle of water and shoe covers with entry which seems unnecessary and must add to the pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in India. I am sure most people would have taken their own water bottle and the shoe covers were only needed if you were to buy the extra ticket needed to enter the actual area where the coffins are located.Perhaps they could be given out with these tickets to reduce the number? Our guide said only a small amount of tourists purchase this extra option.There are separate entry lines for males and females.[.I wonder what they do if you do not identify?] It is common practice in India  to  scan people. Women are taken, separately, into a curtained area   and everyones' bag is searched. You are only allowed to take a very small bag inside. I took my usual cross shoulder 20cm.x24cm.bag and that was fine. They only checked inside the large compartment. The check takes a few seconds......nothing too intimidating , so do not stress. It is to rule out terrorism. Guards carry guns at most, if not all, attractions.Food is not allowed to be taken inside the monument.  We did purchase  25 photos ,taken by a tout, for $2 Australia each . They were returned to our hotel in a folder , size 15x20 cms each. They were very nice although a few had shadows on our faces. Still, they were well worth the price compaired to Aussie photos!!  As we arrived early the sky was very white but as the time went on it changed to a gorgeous turquoise blue enhancing the white hue of the Taj .We also took our own photos with our mobiles and they turned out just fine. There are plenty of vantage points and benches available to pose on.You can get a few shots with reflections of the building by positioning your device near to the water features. The grounds are well maintained and we walked behind the main building and found a river and some local housing to the right.There was also cheeky monkeys and squirrels in the gardens . There were toilets located at the entrance that were clean for Indian standards. There was a toilet supervisor , although payment was not expected.This attraction is not to be missed and we are glad that we ticked it off of our bucket list. It is truly memorable.We stayed for around 2 hours . By the time we left it was getting a lot busier. Outside you are greeted by touts selling magnets , wooden elephants and booklets.etc They can be persistent , if not interested,  just tell them to ""GO Away."" and they will otherwise have a chat about India  They can be interesting ."
"The main reason for visiting Agra is to visit the Taj Mahal.  It is a splendid building, remarkably grand and better in life than photos.  We had an excellent guide (PK) who gave us good tips on the best views, quietest spots and loads of fascinating information about the Taj.We had a sunrise tour as we were told that this is the least busy time of day and because you can really grasp the full beauty of the building as the sun rises and highlights the colours of the marble and the additional shapes made by the shadows.  This is undoubtedly true but Donald Trump was at the Taj later that day and so a large number of tourists changed their itinerary as it was closed from 11 a.m.Be prepared to be searched as you enter the building and be prepared for your group be split up as men and women enter separately.  Do not take any unnecessary bags as they will be scanned separately - possibly some way from the gate that you enter through.  I am told this is normal and not because of added security for that day's VIP.Once inside enjoy every minute and do not get frustrated by other tourists as they push and squeeze for the best views.  You have three hours and your chance will come.  After you pass through the entrance hall you will see the Taj for the first time - remember it and compare the memory as the Taj changes with the rising sun and as the sky gets bluer.  It constantly changes and it is no surprise that most tourist leave with an album of photos.  The gardens on the approach to the Taj are immaculate and the centre pathway is quite crowded.  Take a couple of minutes to walk to the side and the whole place takes on a more peaceful tranquility. To the left and the right of the main building are identical structures - one is a mosque and the other a guest house that look magnificent but not as grand as the Taj.There is a steep stairway that takes you to the second level of the Taj.  You can walk around the whole structure and there are good views of the Taj and its surroundings.  You can go inside but have to remove your shoes or wear shoe covers.  Photographs are forbidden in the mausoleum.We enjoyed our experience and undoubtedly saw the Taj at its best in view of DT's visit.  They were still working on the preparation as we left at 10;30.  However, it did mean that we did not see the Taj as the sun went down because other parts of our itinerary were changed to work with the 'security shut down' for DT's visit.It was still a great experience and a must do if you are in Agra."
"This wonder of the world must be seen to be believed, it requires a long journey to get there but oh so worth it.We arrived just on sunrise and yes you will be harassed to buy trinkets from the many many locals trying to earn a living but we were advised not to say no as that means “maybe” and do not make eye contact. Believe me if you buy from one you will then have another twenty hassle you.Everything was worth seeing the Taj Mahal, an experience you will never forget.I highly recommend getting a good English speaking guide as their is so much to learn about the Taj Mahal and you will miss out on so much and not know what your looking at without a guide, this is my top tip.Our guide which was organised through our personal tour was a local man who has a Masters degree in History and there was nothing he didn’t know and to make things better he was an exceptional photographer, he knew all the tricks to getting lifelong photos on your camera."
"We had been dreaming for a long time about some day visiting the magnificent Taj Mahal after reading about it and seeing it on TV.  However, just seeing the Taj Mahal on TV and in magazines do not even compare to the ""feeling"" that you get while visiting this marvelous structure in person - walking up the long beautiful walkway from the entrance gate to the Taj Mahal itself.  The walkway from the entrance gate - which is beautiful itself - to the Taj Mahal through the beautifully landscaped gardens is a surreal feeling that is difficult to describe - like a ""dream"" feeling.  To the left side of the Taj Mahal is another lovely structure - The Taj Mahal Mosque, and to the right side of the Taj Mahal is the Taj Mahal Guest House which is identical to the Mosque structure.Visitors are allowed to go inside, but you must put on ""booties"" over your shoes to prevent scratching the marble flooring.  There is a very large upper level outdoor floor area that is nice to walk around and marvel at the marble flooring and wall structure - magnificent!  Also, the scenery view from this outdoor upper level is beautiful to see and take photos from.  Note:  NO Photos are allowed inside the Taj Mahal structure - Photo are allowed outside  the structure only.After visiting the Taj Mahal, we had finally fulfilled one of our of top ""places to visit"" listing, and we were not disappointed - I would highly recommend visiting the Taj Mahal while traveling in India."
A fantastic experience which lived up to all of our expectations. The inlay work on the white marble is majestic and the recent cleaning and repairs to the buildings have returned the Taj to its full splendour. Coupled with story of its construction it truly is a wonder.
"The Taj is set in the middle of a large garden area next to a river. It is fabricated of all hand carved white marble and the detail once inside is stunning. Be sure to look up also. No pictures, food/water are allowed inside. Definitely best to come early to avoid the worst of the crowds. Depending upon how long you linger for pictures, the visit can take 2-3 hours."
"I learned about this building since I was in school about 50 years ago. The building is impressive and so a lot of hype came along with it. The background story of this famous building has an equal epic proportion.  There are no carved out markings where the diamonds and precious were supposed to have been embedded. A visitor is only allowed three hours to finish the visit. Depending on the time of the year you visit,  you might get a heavy shrouded Taj Mahal.  Keep the shoe covers if you are going to visit the Baby Taj. This is because the visit to the Baby Taj also requires visitors to remove foot ware."
"Taj Mahal (=crown palace) is a beautiful building. Except architecture, You can find many other Persian elements (Like poem, calligraphy, etc.) there, which looks like mosques and palaces in Isfahan. But Taj Mahal has a unique ivory-white color that differs it from other buildings all over the world. you couldn't bring any food to Taj Mahal. Javab (=answer) mosque (West of Taj Mahal) has a wonderful atmosphere and is good for taking picture (and praying). Taking photo inside the tomb area is forbidden but they take it easy. Original tombs are in the basement and what you see is not original one. The garden is a good for walking and see Taj Mahal from other angles."
Do the Agra Fort first to set the scene for your visit. The Taj Mahal was everything we expected and more. Hugely impressive and the highlight of our Indian tour.
"What ever you have seen or heard about the Taj is true. This is  a fabulous place to visit. The only downside is the total chaos at the entrance. For a World Heritage Site, the organisers have very little control. Pushing and shoving appear to be the order of the day. Suggest get there early!!"
The Taj Mahal is a beautiful serene place that is a must visit in Agra.  Early mornings or late afternoons is best to visit as it can get crowded otherwise.  Definitely get tickets online before hand to avoid ticket lines.  Make sure you get the inside tour tickets as you want to see if from the inside.  Just sit in awe of the beauty of this temple.
The Taj Mahal lives put to all expectations and is a breathtaking sight to see.  Be mindful you have 2 hours to get round everything and be prepared for lots of people.  Nothing will prepare you for the first sight you have of this magnificent building and it’s history.  You can’t take pictures inside and watch people explain things and expecting tips.
"imposing monument, truly original history and architecture, wonderful park, suggestive environment.  good organization for the personalized visit"
Words cannot describe how fabulous this monument is and photographs do not really do it justice. The first glimpse we had through the arch was breathtaking.It was extremely crowded however when we arrived in the middle of the afternoon and the traffic was so heavy that the we didn’t make it to the other side of the river to catch the sunset which was disappointing. Do give yourself enough time to allow for the traffic at that time. I would recommend going for sunrise as the changing light was magical and there were fewer crowds. Due to the visit and iconic photo of Diana it’s almost impossible to get that photo unless you pay one of the many photographers gathering there. Even if you are prepared to pay the crowds waiting make it a lengthy process.
"The Taj Mahal way way exceeded my expectations. It is absolutely stunning. It is quite raised up which I hadn’t appreciated so it is even more of a spectacle as you come through the entrance. I cried. It is truly stunning. get your trip right here as it is quite a highlight for most people and you need to see it the best way you can. Sorry Agra but there is nothing else to do except the fort, so don’t hang around. really, it’s a big place with not much to recommend it. See the Taj early morning and again from the other side of the river and then go! it’s closed on a Friday for worship. I would say go with a pre booked guide to get the best out of it, navigate the queues etc. the security is high and the bag search queue is a pain and very slow. there is lady and man queues for security. We hired a photographer to get the iconic shots and they moved people out of the way, little chance of getting key spots by yourself as the photographers are well used to this and make an informal queue system. We had plenty of time after this to see the place properly. You go inside as well and that is also amazing. from the other side of the river you go into a sort of orchard and you can sit on a wall and just stare at it, it’s gorgeous. the back is the same as the front so it’s a great view. The sun rises and sets to the side, so don’t get too focussed on this. I would suggest maybe going again if you are going to try for photos, so that you can just enjoy being there. In February it was t shirt weather, maybe a jumper first thing."
Blessed with the most gorgeous weather. The very reason to visit India and we switched our plans from a sunrise visit to sunset on recommendation from guide due to haze in morning lately. Amazing place and did not disappoint- feel very blessed
"Having seen and read so much about the Taj Mahal that I was both impressed and underwhelmed. Impressive because it truly is a magnificent example of Mughal architecture, and underwhelming because it’s the same as it looks in photos and documentaries.The best bit of actually seeing this white marbled mausoleum in person is to see up close the details of plant motifs on building walls, the Persian and Arabic calligraphy, and the inlaid pattern of jali lattices. The next best thing is the symmetric arrangement of four minarets that frame each corner of the tomb."
"Neither words nor pictures can do this amazing piece of architecture justice.  It truly is something to be experienced. At first I was disappointed because heavy fog prevented our planned sunrise visit. But I now realize that anytime of day, this marvel will remain a wonder to behold. We were also fortunate to visit the gardens across the way at sunset, where you have a full view of the Taj Mahal from across the waters - so another great way to see this marvel at various times of the day. Do not miss!"
We went to see the TAj Mahal for a belated 25th wedding anniversary. It was worth the wait and everything we had expected plus more. You can read up on the history but this guy must have really loved his wife 😁To get to the entrance you need to take an electric car. No petrol card allowed near the monument. Very haphazard but eventually you get there!! To pay the foreign tourists get a slight discount when paying by card.  On the LHS of the box office. Inside prepare to be accosted by people wanting to take photos. There are some fun photos to take but luckily out guide was an enthusiastic amateur and happy to take for us.  Suggest you look at the photos people have taken and see where the good spots are from there. The Princess Di bench is not the only place to take a photo from!!We went during the day and then later that evening on the other side of the river to take pictures of th3 sunset. Magnificent and the TAj changes Colour with the change in light. Quite beautiful. The next morning we were back again at 0545 for the sunrise pictures. Unfortunately have to pay again and you just go in for 30 min to take photos. Worth it though as it was spectacular and the light just amazing. I was sceptical about going again but completely different feel and worth it.If I was going again I would do the fort in the afternoon and then see the TAj in the evening from across the river. Then go early and do the sunrise and then have the full tour after that. That will save you the cost of the additional entrance fee. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!!
"Loved seeing the Taj Mahal. We had two visits with our guide, one in the afternoon and one first thing in the morning for the sunrise. Unfortunately, it was foggy so we could not see the sunrise but the structure is beautiful. It was very busy so get there well before the opening time. We took some great photos and it is quite a surreal place despite all the people. I loved it."
"The monument itself is very beautiful. Here are some tips for Indian and Foreign tourists:- Book tickets online. During peak season, this will help you avoid the queue for tickets. - 5 - 10 mins on wikipedia will tell you all that you need to know about the Taj Mahal. Spend that 5 - 10 mins and avoid a guide to just know about the history. A guide is useful though in clicking photos on your mobile phone. If you need anything more than selfies with you in the photo, then you can opt for a guide. Negotiate upfront with the guide that he needs to take good photos. If you wish to avoid being scammed, tell the guide upfront that you dont want him to take you to any ""authentic"" shops to buy stuff. - Skip the mausoleum. Whether you are an Indian or non-Indian, the entry fee to the mausoleum is ridiculously high. For just going in and seeing two replica tombs and a few inner rooms (which have no architectural significance), it is not worth spending that extra money. During peak season, you can also expect a lot of crowd inside.- If you are traveling with infants, remember that only limited babyfood like milk powder or biscuits are allowed inside. Any other wet food like khichdi will not be allowed inside. So plan your visit accordingly. Feed your baby well before entering the complex.- Travel light. Mobile phones are allowed. Backpacks will not be allowed inside the complex. There are also restrictions on chemical items being taken into the complex. I heard that most makeup items are not allowed.- I personally enjoyed Agra fort and Fatehpur Sikri more than Taj Mahal because those places had more history and the guides were less of a rip off."
"Wonderful. As I said in the title, it's rare for an iconic place to live up to all the hype, but the Taj Mahal certainly did.  Visited in late February (two days after Trump!). The weather was sunny but not blistering.  The crowds were there but this is a bigger building and site than you imagine and the crowds didn't bother us.  We needed a wheelchair (wife's broken foot) and there are guys with wheelchairs willing to push you around. The price is negotiable but we paid 300R plus a generous tip because he knew the best ways round and great photo angles etc.  The chaotic entrance & security was the only downside to a magical visit."
"Went there for the first time, Love the taj mahal and it was a awesome experience. Love the inside and love the outside more."
"What's there to say. It's the Taj Mahal, one of the most well-known buildings in the world. The whole complex is beautiful. Crowded, yes, even if you go there at opening time. There's no escaping the crowds, but it's still worth it. Morning is the best time to go. Watch the colours change as the sun comes up. It's absolutley stunning."
My second visit here after a space of 25 years. Absolutely stunning. Gardens were immaculate- perhaps after Donald Trumps visit earlier this week! Note it is shut on Fridays. An absolute must see!
Go early. Sunrise is amazing. Sunset on the opposite bank of the river in the park is beautiful too.
Beauty of world. Superb place. Just relax in garden & view it. It's a diamond of India. Don't miss it. Beautiful carving
"Agra was our second stop in an amazing tour of Rajasthan which was booked through Shikhar Travels (Delhi). Our guide Mohd. Nadeem Khan was SO knowledgeable about this monument and made our tour exceptional in spite of the crowds. It IS possible to move away from the throng and find some beautiful peaceful areas to contemplate in this awesome place. Added bonus - our guide took us on a ""heritage walk"" on the other side of the river and gave us views of the Taj. that I expect most travelers do not get.  Yes it's very smoggy at that time of year (November) but get over it and do not miss going, early morning smog is not as bad."
"Up very early and off to Taj Mahal with our driver and guide,  Guide today did a great job and was very satisfactory. Long walk in to the Taj. Walk by the stables and into the center between four gates. Took 22 years to build the completecomplex (1631 to 1653). Built by the 5th Mogul. The main gate is the Rose or Royal Gate. 22 bells on top to signify how long it took to build. The first chapter of the Quran around the arch bottom right to bottom left. All 42 chapters of the Quran may be found on the interior of the Taj Mahal. Taj made from Macrona marble, from India. Active mosque to the left and guest house to the right of. Built on 42 acres. Persian ½ onion dome, Hindu lotus flowers and Chinese octagon shape. Four minarets tilt outward. The precious stone flowers inlaid into the marble are fabulous."
"It was the last day of our two-week business trip in India and I am not going home without seeing Taj Mahal. From the parking area, we took a shuttle going to one of the gates.We had a private tour and much of it was already pre-organized. However, we paid for the entrance fee ourselves. We were given a shoe cover and a bottled water along with the ticket. Don't forget to bring your passport with you as they ask for it.For a smoother access to the area, do not bring big bags or too many stuff with you as much as possible. There is a security check at the gate and they are really strict. Don't forget a camera though!  There are also separate lines for men and women. Aside from the scanners, they also gave us a body check. That body check was weird! The security guard's touch was different and he squeezed my buttocks.The line was not that long but the whole area is really crowded. You need to be patient to get that perfect photo!The architecture is really amazing that you can stare at it for a long time. It is good to have a tour guide as you will be informed of its history and many trivial information. The garden is also vast and lovely. It is also nice to just sit at a bench and enjoy the view.There are photographers around who will take your pictures and upon exit, you can buy the already printed copies. Just before you enter the main building grounds, you have to use the shoe covers! The main building is huge, although I always thought that it is huger. Your are allowed to enter it but only one small room can be visited. The details of the walls of the main building is really nice, you have to come closer to see the carved colorful stones that decorates the walls.We were told that it would be nice to visit it twice on different times of the day as the building's color changes due to the sun's reflection. Some people also visit it at night on a full moon."
