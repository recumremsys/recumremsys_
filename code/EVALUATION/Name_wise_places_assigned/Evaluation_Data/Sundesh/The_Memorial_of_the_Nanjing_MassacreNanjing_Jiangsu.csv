"The site is huge and free to enter, though you'll have to go through a security check to enter the grounds. The museum was extremely crowded, as there are many school groups and even military groups passing through. Expect to be jostled! Visitors should be aware of how contested this history is: China maintains that 300,000 people died, while Japan argues it is far less. Consequently, you will see the figure ""300,000"" absolutely everywhere. It's a highly political site. My biggest concern were the open mass graves (not 1, but 3 mass graves left open for the public to witness). I couldn't help feeling awful, not only that such horrible things happened to these people, but that they were then exhumed and put on display. It's well worth visiting, but not without its faults."
"Visited during a National Holiday, it was very busy but the queue was managed well and so we were not waiting too long. You'll see excavations on unimaginable scales, and then the following exhibitions are very well done. The exhibition does have tinges of pro-nationalist rhetoric but on the whole, it was very informative and used photography and stories very well for you to build a sense of the context, events and aftermath of the Massacre.If visiting during busy Summer spells, bring sunscreen and water as we had to queue outside for a time."
"Being Chinese but being raised in the US, it was very informative and emotional to tour this site. very well done"
"I read many comments before visiting this place.  It was not what I expected.  I was given the impression it was to commemorate what all happened in Nanjing (and China) in the 1930s and 1940s.  But, as another just posted, it's more.  It covers all of WWII - ETO as well as PTO.  It covers  what happened in numerous countries.  There are even front pages from various newspapers so you can also read about other events of the country (like FDR giving up his court packing plan).  Many photos, numerous relics, a couple of videos, and simply lots to see.  Yes, very subjective at some displays, quite objective at others.  If you didn't study up on WWII, you'll learn a lot.  If you know quite a bit about the war, you'll still learn something new.  Two metro stops in that part of town, one being closer than the other (line 5???).  Let the statue be your guide - woman with child and dove.  You can see her from afar.  Take the walkway ""between the walls of the curve.""  No one else was around for me to follow and I did plenty of wandering to find the entrance."
"Went there during our stay in Nanjing, to realize that they are closed until December 13, 2018 for renovations and to prepare for the anniversary of the event. Just be aware if you will be in the area during this time. We were still able to walk around the outside which was very tranquil as there were nobody around except a security guard."
"Going through this memorial museum was a very somber experience. The history that is documented is extremely horrific, and can be quite upsetting. In the middle of the museum there is an open pit in the floor where a mass grave was found when they were excavating for the building. This is set up as an exhibit to show the actual skeletons of people killed during the massacre.Don't expect this to be a 'fun' day out. But I think it's a must see if you come to Nanjing."
"It is of course a very somber site, but well worth visiting. It is easy to access, right outside the metro station. Be prepared for long lines to get in, but it moved along quickly. Free entrance. We went around lunchtime and I think that was a good choice as the line afterward was much longer (maybe try going early also?). The crowds were sizable inside, so have patience. The exhibits are well designed with significant information in Chinese and English. The design is well done for the outside/memorial and there is a lot of information to take in inside."
"visiting this place is a MUST! I think it’s not suitable for children.. being there made me somehow living that tragedy!!! the pain , Injustice,  and the Lack of resourcefulness .. i felt like the place is alive.It’s worth for visiting.. I usually feel bored visiting museums but this one you will be excited ,interested and wanting to see more until the end."
"We visited on their long weekend and there were a lot of people visiting at the time.  Having said that it was well set out and catered very well for English speakers such as ourselves.  We had a interpreter with us who made it much easier for us to understand the significance, but, there were many explanations in English to help if you did not have one.  The Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne is the only place I can compare it to but it does not have as much detail as this particular museum.  Certainly a place to visit, but probably best to do so when it is not quite so busy as it was difficult to get to see a lot of the exhibitions without having to queue or push yourself into the crowds to view them.  Well worth a visit if you are into history. but take at least a half day to work your way around it."
"Great Museum with lots of exhibits! Had a great time reviewing the history and I need to go back when I have more time. If you're interested in no holds barred WWII history, then this is a must see when you're in the neighborhood."
This memorial is a must visit if you want to understand Nanjing and modern China. I was impressed with the lasting message from this memorial - that we must remember the victims of this atrocity but strive towards peace. It's not a pleasant couple of hours and I wouldn't take young kids but I'm very glad I visited. Leave thorough exit 7 and there's another free museum about WW2... We happened upon it by accident but it was another well presented exhibition.
"Remember that this is closed on a Monday. The sculptures on the outside get you in the mood for what is a sombre experience. Obviously the story is told from a Chinese perspective but it absolutely was a massacre. I studied history to MA level and I had never heard about this awful tragedy. The expats in the city e.g. priests, lecturers industrialists (e.g. Rabe who was a Nazi party member and Siemen's man in Nanjing) did alot . The foreign diplomats seemed to do very little.You don't need Chinese for this heritage centre."
I had no knowledge of this event so I thought it would be a good idea to learn some local history. Was not disappointed. Large amount of artifacts and English was also used on all displays. Would recommend a visit by anyone visiting Nanjing.
My son was aware about the massacre of Nánjīng but I was not. The museum is free and huge with 3 sections. Yes it is crowded and there are strange elements such as crowds for video with no order. The evidence for the massacre is overwhelming and the story does need to be told. The horror of war is clear but the behaviour of the invading forces were shocking. The sad truth however was peace did not come from this as there was a bloody civil war with atrocities that followed. Having noted this there were real heroes both Chinese and foreign. There are issues that challenge ones perception for examples me the role of Germans saving many innocent people with safe zones. War is terrible so this is not an easy place but is as relevant as other sites of massacre.
"This is a very sobering place to visit.  Built to remember the victims of the massacre of upwards of 300,000 people, it is a very solemn place.  The memorial itself is very minimalistic, very stark, almost abstract.  It has a very grim feel, which if probably appropriate for such a horrific event in history.  The only reason that I do not give it 5 stars is that I visited on a holiday weekend and there were masses of people which detracted from the memorial to a small degree.  I would like to visit this place again when there are fewer people and when I can more fully absorb the magnitude of what it represents."
"The atmosphere changed drastically from lively robust to solemnly quiet once you enter this place which held too many sad memories from the past. It can be quite eerie due to the silence, but everyone was comfortable with it. Spend a few hours walking around here and take in the information slowly. Those who died shall not be forgotten."
"I really wanted to like this place and the effort is noble, but don’t come expecting to learn much or to be able to pay respectful homage.  The crowds make it impossible to do either.  Entry lines can take forever and scores of school groups move through en masse, hurriedly.  Then there are the adult tour groups, often with commentary.  Getting close enough to read the captions is a struggle.That’s just for the educational/museum component.  For something so important to the country and the city, I don’t understand why the hours haven’t been lengthened.The memorialization part is less congested, as it should be, because it makes the same point over and over and over.  At the entry are row after row of ledgers high up on the wall, presumably filled with some sort of official documents, then, almost immediately, there are the name-filled metal books listing victims while above are representative portraits.  So far, so good, but then you leave the building and encounter 1-an eternal flame, 2-a stone paved burial site, 3-an excavated burial site, 4-a darkened room with electric candles representing more specific victims, and 5-a reflecting pool and massive-for-the-site statue entitled “Peace.”  It would have been hard to have come up with something more trite or less subtle.  (There is also an equally massive relief centered on a bugler apparently rousing, I dunno, the citizenry? the troops? the conscience of the world?  Whatever, it is altogether discordant.)  It seems the design committee couldn’t bring itself to eliminate anything.I should add that the site is not just huge; it is also laid out such that when you finally exit, you are a LONG way from the metro station, the exit of which is directly across the street from the entrance to the building.  The walk thereto, at least in English, is poorly marked.Depending on your interest and patience, maybe you’ll be educated and moved, but you may also be thinking from the beginning, “Please, just get me outta here!”  5 stars for the effort, 1 for the experience, hence my 3-star rating.  Good luck."
"Visiting the Nanjing Massacre Museum was definitely a heart wrenching solemn experience. We had to do it after staying in the city of Nanjing for 4 yrs . That’s the first thing that came up when we first googled Nanjing. The best of the whole visit was coming out of it with a beautiful message .  “ BEAR HISTORY IN MIND , CHERISH PEACE”"
My husband and I visited the museum to learn more about the history of Nanjing.  We found that it was very well made and it was hauntingly sad and beautiful. We couldn't go through all the material because of the long lines (we went during the holiday) but it was still good even if we only got bits and pieces. Write ups were factual and unbiased in our opinion. A must-visit when in Nanjing.
"This is a surprisingly low-key museum.  Very tasteful.  The Wikipedia article about the Nanjing Massacre is much harsher.The displays inside the Museum are mostly pictures and recreations of scenes of events from the time.  There are a number of pieces of military equipment, uniforms and such.  There's an interesting section about the efforts of foreign residents in NJ at the time which has a letter written on Third Reich stationary to John Rabe.The Museum really hits home when you get to the building, separate from the main section, housing one of the mass graves.  It is a chilling place.It should be mentioned that one needs to act with a bit of decorum there because the antics of some of the visitors at the time of my visit were appallingly disrespectful.  Climbing on statues for whimsical pictures.  Tossing rocks around.  And the person loudly barking into his phone in the mass grave building despite the angry glares from the people in there and in contradiction to the many signs requesting respect."
"This was one of the best sites to see in Nanjing. The crowds were crazy with field trips and other tourist. We wished it was more spread out and more English subtitles. We read the Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang before going to the city, so this is helpful in knowing the history. The outside of the museum is great  and beautiful to walk around. Take your time! Go early and get the most out of this museum."
"This museum was actually very impressive and carefully detailed the invasion of Nanjing by the Japanese and all the things they did to the city and the people. Would highly recommend it to those who want to learn what happened in Nanjing during WWII, and the ending is very positive with a message of peace. Was very moved by the whole experience."
"Given the historical significance, I would say this is a ""must see"", but I did not find it all that great. If you have read Iris Chang's book ""The Rape of Nanjing"", you are not going to learn anything really new at the museum, and I didn't find the presentation all that compelling. The descriptions of the battle are overly patriotic and clearly intended for a Chinese audience. Spend adequate time on the statues along the entry path - in my opinion, they are the best part of the museum, and you don't pass that way when you exit."
"As a History teacher, a visit to Nanjing would not be complete without a visit to the museum. It is an awesome place, extremely well funded and jaw droppingly complete. Read as much as you can, absorb the horror and remember that this happened less than 100 years ago."
"Visited Nanjing for the first time and this was the only place I really wanted to visit here. The memorial is done up very nicely with many photos and testimonials of the atrocities carried out so many years ago. It is a really good place for locals and tourists alike to visit to comprehend the horrors of war, similar to the holocaust museum I had visited in DC. My only gripe is that the visitors should respect the solemnness of the place and gravity of the incidents that happened so many years ago. Maybe it was the weekend and there were many tourists but it was really noisy and children were running all over. The staff should try to ensure that noise is kept to the minimum."
A rather tough memorial place. Very well setup. Try to go on a weekday as it was too many people when i was there.
People are waiting in line to visit. Try to avoid weekends and holidays and get to there ealier to beat the crowds. Each day there are a huge number of visitors coming to the memorial.
"it was chinese new year holiday when we got here..probobly 11 am..be sure to eat breakfast  first because you will spend 1 or 2 hrs in the line.it was raining,and yet still heavy line..when you enter the premises,there is still another line inside beforeactually getting inside the building..so for those bringing kids and elderly,,think about it again.inside is really dark,containing the pictures and names of the countless victims.and exhibition of the pictures ofwhat happened in the war. also have bones of the actual people who died..you cant really appreciate it so much because of the so many people inside. choose the day when you go here,must not be any chinese holiday and weekends.."
"This memorial is easy to get to via subway. Be prepared to bring your local ID card or passport and to walk for quite a long distance. The museum will make you sad to be human and sick at all the suffering caused by the Japanese military in the 1930s. Nonetheless, the museum tries to give a positive spin to things, by featuring people who sought to save residents during the massacre, the efforts of journalists to tell the real story of the massacre to the outside world, and efforts to create peace after the war."
"Good quality museum, not too crowded. Quite graphic in places. Allow a couple of hours. Best to visit in the morning, so you don't get too depressed over dinner."
"As a historian who visits China frequently, I had been wanting to visit this important museum and memorial.  Allow at least two hours for a quick tour and longer if you like to read everything.  Each exhibit has an excellent English translation of the Chinese text.  The museum is thoughtfully-designed and feels new.  Be prepared for crowds, but you don't have to feel rushed.  The statues on the grounds are moving.  The museum/memorial is free.  Audioguides are not available.  Food and restrooms are available."
"Finding the entrance from the Metro is easy (you can see it after coming out from the exit) but finding the exit back to the station is difficult. There's isn't any clear sign around and you may feel disoriented after turning in circles around the outdoor exhibitions. at the exit (after the tall statue), you should walk towards your right-hand direction where there is a cultural/performance center. you should be able to see the sign pointing towards the metro near the road after some walking distance. as a point of reference, you will pass by the China Fabrics Village (free entrance) along the way. the metro station is just right down the road. the museum provided the account of all parties-Japanese, Chinese and foreigners present during that period and visitors can judge for themselves whether to believe it or not."
"I visited this museum on Labor Day. While crowded, the staff made sure everyone in line right before closing was able to visit. The information presented is factual, unbiased, and well presented. You could easily spend half a day here. Had it not been so crowded and right before closing time I would have spent more time here. It was the best museum I've ever been to. I was disappointed to see children here. It is not suitable for children to visit."
"Your  trip to Nanjing is incomplete if you fail to visit  Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall/ Museum Entry is free. The hall has been able to preserve the horrors of war.  This  hall was built to memorialize those that were killed in the Nanjing Massacre after the fall of the  then capital of China, Nanjing, on December 13, 1937.This hall has well preserved the equipment and weapons used during the war, real bunker, picture galleries, statues . While leaving the hall you will definitely feel sad. 8:30 am-16:30 pm (closed on Monday)Bus: take bus no. 7, 37, 61, 63, 161, 166, 170 or 186 to get off at Jiangdongmen.Subway: take subway line 2 and get off at Yunjin Road. Take exit 2 and walk westwards to get there"
"Not for the faint hearted, it really describes the horror of the Nanking massacre and shows it in horrible detail. Skip the part about WO2 in general though as it contains a lot of propaganda. Just leave after reaching the peace square. It can get busy and they only let so many people in at once, so come early. It takes about an hour to walk through te exhibit. Only downside is that some Chinese people don't know how to pay respect"
