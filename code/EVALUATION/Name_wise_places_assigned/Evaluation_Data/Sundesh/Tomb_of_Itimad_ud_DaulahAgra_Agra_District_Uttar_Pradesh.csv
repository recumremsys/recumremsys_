We visited here during our tour of India üáÆüá≥. We did it by ourselves which was fine and have a lovely few hours just walking around the beautiful gardens and lovely views. I was was very disabled friendly which was great as my partner uses a mobility scooter and was about to get around.  Just a few things to point out if your going on your own.... be aware that unofficial people will ask you to show you around and then demand money from you!! They are nothing to do with the place and the security guards are just as bad wanted money of us for taking photos of us together and they are really persistent and don‚Äôt take no for an answer easily. Just stand your ground. Tipping  are a big thing in India for anything....
Visited the place after the Tal Mahal. It felt good as more intimate and less visitors. The building is really nice.I do really recommend it for a visit.
"Loved visiting ‚Äúbaby Taj‚Äù because of its history and architecture. This jewel-box has four main entrances that are equally  designed, while each gate has different bottle patterns. Pretty good history behind it too."
"Went and visited the Baby Taj.  Thought this place was great and when I went, not too many crowds.  Thought this place was spectatular and nice to see it before the Taj.  Really nice place and remember to bring money for shoe covers to get inside."
Went at the end of the day but before going to view sunset over the Taj Mahal.  Very peaceful and serene.  Late afternoon sunshine on this monument was lovely and the views over the river are great too.
"This is my favorite monument in Agra. Visited this place to show my guests from UK bcz I run my own company ""Sachan Walking Tours"". They also liked it very much. It's a beautiful monument on the bank of Yamuna and marvelous example of pietra-dura."
"Visited Baby Taj immediately after Grown Up Taj and was pleasantly surprised. Firstly there was hardly anyone else there which was great after the hugeness and hecticness of GUT.  Secondly it‚Äôs more colourful than GUT, really very pretty because of the use of pastel colours.  Worth a visit to see how BT influenced the design of GUT."
This is a tomb so not much to see. But the building is VERY BEAUTIFUL details. Go see my instagram @stellameryl for the closer photo. You should sit in front of one of the window for closer detail photo. ALL WHITE building. My second fav visit after Taj mahal
"This was well worth battling the traffic to visit. Our guide said that the tomb was one of the inspirations for the Taj Mahal and so is referred to as the 'baby Taj'. It was very peaceful walking around and almost void of tourists. Be warned though, there are plenty of monkeys on the site so don't get too close to them!"
This was one of the monument I wanted to see for a long time. When I saw this fully it proved to be much more than I expected. Structur provide an opportunity to photograph. Understand the mind of the lady about her love for his father in whoose memory this structure was built. One can see beutifull paintings on walls & roof.Structure has been declared world heritage monument & preservation is good & garden around structre is being well maintained.Recommended to must see specifically for those having interest in history & love to see old monuments.
"Went to Baby Taj after visiting Taj Mahal, spectacular little place walked around for ages, absolutely no crowds. Was only one other family there so practically had place to myself.  Loved the intricate designs of buildings and standing in tomb looking out over river, amazing at sunset. Only issues was once I had paid and was inside a man insisted I buy shoe coverings, thought it strange no one had done that at main entrance. So pretty sure I was conned, check at entrance before entering if you need shoe covering !!!!"
"I went to the tomb during a visit to Agra. It is known ans the baby Taj. It was the first Mughal building created entirely in marble, rather than sandstone. There are steps so those of limited mobility should be aware. The site is of historical significance, so well worth a visit. Recommended."
"You‚Äôll be disappointed if you go here after although it‚Äôs still quite beautiful in it‚Äôs own right.  Built before the Taj it‚Äôs the first of the three, the third being baby Taj in Aurangabad"
"Many who go to Agra, go there only for the Taj. Do make time for this lovely gem of masterpiece. The surroundings are quieter, the crowd is lesser, but the beauty of this place takes your breath away. Spend an hour or two just resting in the shade and admiring the beauty and thinking of the times that were."
"Little disappointed as visited after going to Taj Mahal. Seems Taj Mahal is inspired from this tomb. However, Taj Mahal is much grander and beautiful than this tomb. Spent less than 30 minutes at this place. Can visit but can't say a must visit"
"This is a small jewel, really worth to see. Made of marble, located in the beautiful garden by the Yamuna River. Go there in the evening. Probably you will see the monkeys there as well."
"This was advertised to me as the Baby Taj and although it was influential in the design of that wonder, it is not of the same quality. Painted rather than the ornate inlaid stone of the real thing. That being said, I found it interesting and is well worth a visit, even if it's a relatively long journey from the Taj."
"It is easy when visiting Agra to see the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort and then rush on.  Don't!  The Itimad ud Dualah is a masterpiece in its own right and is well worth a visit.  In fact, if it weren't for the Taj, Agra would be famous for this!  It is small and need not take long to visit but it is worth lingering to take in its beauty and prefect proportions.  The story behind it is also worth knowing."
"Went early, straight after the sunrise trip to the Taj and we were the only people there. A lovely building with some stunning inlay work all over the building."
Its a beautiful architecture with a huge garden area and river yamuna flowing right behind it. Good place to visit. Try to avoid during summer afternoon. Very steep parking charges outside.
"This is a wonderful tomb which inspired the Taj Mahal.  Built by the most power Empress of India (the Persian wife of Jahangir & aunt of Taj Mahal) for her father.  Near the Akbar Garden across the river from the Taj (best to see both at the same time).  This is more a palace than a tomb.   Not much to see in the interior.  Had to rush to Akbar's Garden to view the Taj for 3 hour, only gave me an hour here.  If you ignore the ridiculous entry fee of INR 220, the building is enough different from the Taj to make it the second prettiest building in India (the alternate Taj near Mumbai is no where close in beauty).  This is a hidden gem...."
Loved this place & would definitely recommend to other people. What an amazing piece of Architecture. Wow Factor!! So glad our tour guide showed us this place.
"The father of Taj Mahal or the first example of marble architecture by Mughals. This place is as beautiful if not more than the Taj. Set by the side of the Yamuna River, this wonder is calm, quiet and a delight to spend a peaceful afternoon or catch the golden sunset by the river."
We visited this Taj later in the afternoon when it was getting dusk. The amazing marble with its inlaid semi precious stone is superb and the architecture fantastic. There are water features too but for us it was so interesting to view the Yamona river and see the buffalo bathing on the opposite bank as well as the bird life on the water. It was very quiet when we were there. Do look at the tomb of the Emperor and his family.
Visited this after Taj Mahal and loved it. Restored gardens emit a wonderful fragrance to enjoy this beautifully decorated building. The lack of the crowds are welcome in this tourist-heavy city.
Staying in Agra there are times when you crave some peace and quiet. A visit to this site is just the ticket. It is the mausoleum of the Mogul‚Äôs mother‚Äôs family. It is right by the river Yamuna on the opposite side to the Red Fort and the Taj Mahal but on the same side as the Mehtab Bagh gardens. There are lovely gardens and some exquisite wall decorations which differ from those found in the Taj Mahal. The entrance fee is 250 rupees and the toilets there are very good.
"While not as large or publicized like the Taj Mahal or Agra Fort, this little gem should not be missed if you have the time.  A major significance of this mausoleum is that it was the first building of Mughal architecture of white marble instead of red sandstone.  It was built by Empress Noor Jahan in 1622-29 to honor her parents, who are buried there.  The inlays and detail are exquisite!!  Called the ‚Äúmini Taj‚Äù by locals, many of its designs were incorporated into the Taj Mahal which was built later.  A peaceful place, less crowded and with a beautiful garden.  Try to include it if you can."
"Went here on our tour of the area, giving us a fantastic viewpoint of the history of Agra. There is so much to see in this are  worth a visit"
"Itamd Ud Daula is in a way more silent & peaceful than Taj Mahal as rush is very less than Taj Mahal. You can relax, draw a painting for many hours without being distracted by any commotion around the area. Designing wise this mosleum is symmetrical from all 4 side having 7 graves in it. It was built by Mughal Empress Nur Jahan in year 1621 much before Taj Mahal. A must visit if you came to Agra. You can plan your visit as- Early Morning Taj Mahal because of rush factor and then Agra fort. Take some rest in hotel. Afternoon, you can visit here. Ventilation is so good, even during warm days, you will feel coolness inside mosleum.My advice is to avoid any guides on the spot as history is pretty well documented unless it is very necessity. Just enjoy the design and architecture of the place.Enjoy your visit!"
"Our guide was invaluable for explaining the historical significance of this site.  Enjoyed the quieter location, the peaceful grounds and the ability to look at everything up close.  The skill and craftsmanship is amazing.  It would seem anticlimactic to see it after the Taj so I would suggest viewing it after the Agra Fort and before heading to see the Taj Mahal.  You will appreciate it much more then."
Go with a guide. Fascinating story behind the beautiful intricate carvings and stonework. Alternative sneak peek at the Taj Mahal.
This mini Taj does not attract much attention from tourists. It has very similar design and architecture to the Taj except for the dome. Remove your shoes to enter the tomb. Avoid taking the shoe cover because it is just a used cover but they will still ask for tip and payment.
"Known as the mini or baby Taj because it has a similar profile, this mausoleum is well worth visiting. It is quite a small site, but the building itself is beautiful, very decorative and has a restful air to it. There are some wonderful murals and the layout of the main room of the mausoleum is an echo of that of the Taj Mahal.Sadly, there is less attention to the maintenance of this monument than there is at the Taj itself and there is some graffiti damage inside it. However, a visit here should still be on the itinerary."
Easy to overlook with the wonderful Taj Mahal close by. But don't!!  It has none of the crowds and is an exquisite building and garden in which to while away an hour or two. Haggle hard with Auto-rickshaw driver and you'll get there for under Rs150.
"India has so many incredibly beautiful monuments, this is yet another one.  This is definitely worth a visit.  Called the Baby Taj, it is often forgotten by tourists so its worth visiting just to get away from the crowds.  The tomb is detailed and quite beautiful in it's white marble and semi-precious stones."
