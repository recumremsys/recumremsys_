"The Broads National Park is a great place for exploring, it's very clean and beautiful! Be sure to visit if you're in the local area"
Took a boat ride in this famed area of lakes and waterways and the views were fantastic.  There are also numerous birds and waterfowls to spot and identify.  On the whole an interesting and lovely place to explore.
"Hired a day boat to explore the Broads. It is a very tranquil area. Lots of boats sailing past , all with a friendly wave. Lots of little coves to pull into and watch the boats and birds go by . Not as many pubs/ shops around the broads as we imagined, so you’d be advised to walk with your food and drink and settle in for a very quiet day ."
"We spent a very relaxing five days sailing on the Broads.  The scenery and wildlife was stunning.  I wish the same could be said about the boat.  We hired Horizon 2 from Hoseasons and picked it up from Richardson’s boatyard at  Stalham.  I think the boat was built at the same time as the ark.  It was very tired and in desperate need of some tic.  The motor however was pristine.  The boat was very long and difficult to reverse and moor in some places.  We visited Ludham, Coltishall, Wroxham then returned to Stalham.    Some tips, hire a hairdryer if you need one, there are no sockets on the boat, make sure you have a 12v plug to charge up phones.  Take your own pillows or ask for extra.  The ones we had were so flat we had to sleep on folded up blankets and clothes.  Showers are fine if you are 5 foot or under.  Having said all that we had a lovely time.  Definitely wouldn’t hire that boat again though."
"The broads is a beautiful, relaxing place and you have to come at least once. Particularly the North Broads is full of quaint old villages, lovely broads and plenty of good pubs to have a pint by the water or eat some tasty grub. Nature is in abundance and if you keep your eyes open you'll see plenty you won't have seen elsewhere. Recommend Barnes Brinkcraft boats. Take a short break (Mon - Fri) and just take it steady. Perfect"
Absolutely gorgeous. Loved the area. Stunning views and so relaxing cruising around. Loads of good boat hire companies arouncMust see
"My family and me have just returned from a weeks boating holiday cruising the rivers of the Broads National Park and no matter how many times we visit, there is always something different and mystical about the place. Drive through it and around it and it's amazing; cruise through it and it's just breathtaking. Thoroughly recommended is this part of the UK."
Forgot how beautiful and relaxing the broads where. Had our honeymoon here back in 1997 and our return was fantastic. Some lovely little towns and villages to visit with wonderful bars and restaurants a plenty. If you've never holidayed on the broads i would highly recommend it.
Call me biased but I love the county of Norfolk and the Norfolk Broads. The countryside and vistas differ from one area of the County to another. There is always something to do plenty of walking sailing boating on the Broads bird watching plenty of entertainment friendly people Norfolk is the place to be
"Just returned from a lovely boating holiday which was quite magical. A lovely place to be if you appreciate the wilds of nature! I would recommend having a loose plan though as some of the more popular areas to moor get full up (these are often the ones with more facilities and shops). The boat had surprisingly good storage space so I would stock up on food beforehand, just in case you can't find a mooring space in time to have an evening meal at a pub. Our best night was being mudweighted in the middle of a gorgeous wild broad, cooking jar-based curry for dinner! (Our boat also had a decent sized microwave which could accommodate ready meals). Having said all that, we were able to moor everywhere we wanted to, and were blessed with unusually beautiful weather!"
"Having travelled the canals for many years, we had never visited The Broads. There is so much to see it was difficult to know where to go. We chose Wroxham. The scale of the place  and the number of available board is incredible. We drove around the area towards Caister crossing many waterways and more and more boats. Being a fan of boats and birds, can't believe it has taken so long to visit."
"We have been regular visitors to the Broads for over 20 years - hotels, cottages, b & bs, boats. It is a beautiful area with different aspects to enjoy. It should be compared with other outdoors type destinations such as The Lake District for example, it is not a holiday resort bursting with shops, cafes, bars and pre-set activities.  Another reviewer referred to it as man-made which sort of suggests theme park to me. Now whilst the actual Broads themselves (small lakes) were created as a result of peat digging a very very very long time ago,  they are connected by a small number of rivers which meander through beautiful countryside and pass by/through small hamlets and villages, as well as up to the city of Norwich for example , and through the seaside town and port of Great Yarmouth which joins the two areas of the Broads which are to its North and South.  The speed limit for watercraft varies between 4 & 6 mph so passage is at a gentle pace and thus takes much longer than by a car on straight roads, so you will not reach a metropolis, or even a shop, every hour or two! In fact there are often no shops at many of the spots and sometimes not even in the small villages - afterall if it was that built up as an area, i.e.with facilities at every turn, it wouldn't be the special place it is. Those who go walking in the fells don't expect a Burger King half way around their hike of the day! So,if you want services and facilities on tap this may not be the holiday for you, especially if you are in a boat. There are lovely villages on the water , some with a pub, a cafe , a local shop or two, a nature walk etc but other mooring places for boats, and often holiday cottages etc, are set in very quiet locations, not least so that the peace and the wildlife can be enjoyed/observed, or a waterside walk undertaken. There are some stretches of river which gently wander through fields and you can trundle along and not see a building or even another boat for some time. These stretches are more frequent on the southern side, but whether North or South the quiet stretches of water offer the chance to see some fabulous wildlife rather than a pub and some houses, so choose your locations after a brief bit of simple research. Same goes for the choice/location of a holiday cottage, bed and breakfast etc. Another reviewer called their waterbourne trip ""boring""  so perhaps they didn't consult a proper map and simply pointed the boat in any random direction. Research is key - if on a little boat for a day then do you want to head for a quiet picnic spot, or a pub lunch, or somewhere with a boardwalk/nature walk? Or do you want to see Wroxham (the so called capital of the Broads) and all its waterside properties from the river. And remember, if you are on a boat as your accommodation it is not a floating holiday cottage or hotel - you will not have electricity on tap, you will need to fill up your water tank regularly (various places to do this) and there is no room service so ensure you have at least the basics to eat and drink, and some easy meals if you are not aiming for a pub ( or decide to stop somewhere else that takes you fancy). This is all part of the fun. Being on the water is wonderful , magical, peaceful and amazing. Nothing like spotting a kingfisher or heron on the bank, or hearing the owls hooting as you go to bed with the water swishing around the boat. Early mornings with a coot or swans by the boat as you have a cuppa, or spot an otter by the riverbank - all these things are special. If you hire a cottage which is waterside you will also be able to enjoy the wildlife first hand, or from the comfort of a cosy armchair, or whilst fishing from the garden.  Equally there are some lovely cottages and B&Bs where you can walk to the riverside and even to a shop or two, or the pub or the restaurant. We are back to that key thing - do your research! The greatest thing about the Broads is that it can be enjoyed by three generations all together - unlike a hike to the fells where really only the younger or fitter ones can participate. We've done Broads holidays with children, teenagers, grandparents and some limited mobility family. It's a unique and special area ,  and if you seek peace, tranquility, nature, or even a pub lunch by the river and a browse in a local quirky shop, you will certainly enjoy The Broads. If you sail, or fish, this is also a great destination for a holiday. If you fancy an upgrade on camping, with a floating home for the week instead and a different view each morning, you'll love the adventure of a boating holiday whether as a young family, couple or mixed age group. If you prefer to have all home comforts on tap you could choose a cottage or small b&b. Some holiday rentals offer a dayboat so you can tootle off for a river trip but return to all your creature comforts in the evening. Before I go, one myth I must definitely bust - The Broads is not actually a real National Park, though plenty of businesses and the authority for the waterways abuse the national parks link that the area has, and like to kid all the tourists !"
Boating on the broads should be made mandatory for everyone at least once in their lives. It is such a relaxing thing to do and for only £15 a head six of us hired a boat and spent the day pootling about in the sunshine stopping at each pub for refreshments. A fantastic way to spend a Saturday.
"Took a boat tour of two of the broads.  Very interesting to see, beautiful homes.  Also walked around one of the locations."
Visit here often as have a boat moored on the broads. Great for a relaxing break to get away either for a few days or longer. Go at your own pace and moor up at different places each night.
"Superb place to potter about on a boat, very well kept.  Gets really busy in summer and even end September / October parking for boats is tricky if near well pretty much anything!Worth a visit, and a bit of advanced planning sorts the parking options :-)"
"We spent a fabulous day exploring the quite end of The Broads by boat. Hickling Broad, Horsey Windmill and the stunning rivers that connect the two. We started out from Martham Ferry Boat Hire."
Spent a day strolling in a lovely park and a boat trip on the broads. Enjoyed the tranquility of the gardens and many species of plants and birds.
"Nice and relaxing place, plenty cafes and pubs for a nice meal or for a drink. Possibility to rent a boat. Take a bread loaf as there are lots of friendly swans and duck around!"
Spent a wonderful peaceful two hours on a cruise with an excellent commentary by the skipper.  The wildlife was abundant and I would certainly go back again to view more
Went for a very relaxing two hour boat trip. The experience was a joy. Boat very clean and food and drink served.
We went to a day visit to the Broads. We hired disabled friendly boat from the Broad boating company. It had its own car park. Had to pay £3 for parking. We paid £58 for three hours hiring a boat. Disabled chair was available from the company. We had lovely three hours on water on selfdrive boat. It was easy to drive. I recommend this day trip to any disabled person who is bound on wheelchair.
"Staying in a cottage by Wayford Bridge and have canoed up and down the Broads. Our favourite was the trip to Neatishead, a long pull from Wayford but worth the stunning wildlife, including herons and kingfishers and many swans. Lovely pub in Neatishead too!"
Get yourself into a kayak or a canoe to help the environment and enjoy this bootiful and peaceful place. It's fab and if you want a boat try and book an electric one.
"Toured on a tourist boat, with lots of funny stories of local history and luminaries. Easiest way to get around, but made me want to immediately hire a boat and stay for a week. We had perfect, sunny weather, and nice people on the boat with us, not too crowded."
"Just back from a lovely week on the southern broads. Pubs, water, food, wildlife. Lovely week.stayed at Beccles, Loddon, Oulton Broad amongst others and it was quite. Totally recommend April. Plenty of room wherever you go. Loved the broads."
"Went with a company well known around here. The broads are stunning, and worth a few days of staying in a boat. Wildlife beautiful."
"We recently hired a day boat from Wroxham with friends, and had a super day out. The rental company gave us all the instructions and safety advice, lifejackets etc, and we were soon ready to go. We took a picnic, our cameras and with such wonderful weather, lovely scenery, it was impossible to go wrong. Lots of nice pubs to moor up to, and other stops for sandwiches and pies. I really can't wait to go again. Not expensive when you consider that it's a full day's fun for a family and friends. Give it a try."
"The Norfolk broads is a gem on the edge of east anglia. Now with reasonable road links it's the perfect place to spend a relaxing holiday or short break away from the hassle and gun crime in the rest of the U.K. There are plenty of low cost hotels and b&b's to choose from and a plethora of rural villages and historic towns to visit. Easy links to Norwich with its Norman Castle and 2 cathedrals, one being the second tallest in England. Hire a boat, take a hike or visit the coast, unlike the rest of the U.K. It's usually not raining."
"Took a scenic boat trip through tge Broads for 1.5hrs.  Well organised, covid safe boats - with lots of seats removed.  The Broads were beautiful and it was lovely to gently meander through the water.  Boat was embarked at Wroxham which was a very busy, over touristy, town.  But worth putting up with the town to do the boat trip.  Recommend booking the boats a day ir so in advance as get very booked up.  Very enjoyable."
"Ranworth is a bird sanctuary just outside South Waltham in Norfolk. The broads themselves are absolutely stunning. There's a boardwalk leading to a pontoon where you can sit upstairs using their binoculars to see the local bird life. Coming back to the broad itself where there is a lovely little gift shop, tea rooms and the local pub. The food is first class in the pub. The tea rooms sell lovely tea and cakes and the gift shop also sells boxes of bird food so you can feed all the fowl you want. A lovely day out."
"We have discovered one of the most peaceful relaxing places to be to get away from every day life.  We will now be returning on many occasions to enjoy this haven of tranquility.  Have enjoyed the beautiful  place in holiday homes and boat hire and cannot rate it highly enough.  Forget airports and motorways, this is the place to be. The whispering reeds, the abundant wild life including many birds, geese, otters and majestic sunrises and sunsets. An everchanging landscape that calms in the best way possible."
"day launch hire from Potter Heigham, can be expensive but not at Maycraft. Located by walking 5 mins along the downstream bank from Herbert Woods boatyard behind about 20 riverside chalets we found Maycraft a traditional yard still working on wooden boats . Hired a perfectly suitable diesel engined day boat and enjoyed a lovely half day cruising to Ranworth and back. Overran our time by 20 minutes but the yard simply said as long as we enjoyed ourselves they were happy!!! They offer fully fitted cruisers as well about 30% cheaper than other local yards. No on site parking but only 5 minute walk. Would definately use again."
We have just returned from another broads holiday on the boat Broadway. Had a lovely time despite the weather the boat was really good and very comfortable and easy to drive. We called into horning marina for water one day whilst we were there we mentioned we couldn't get the TVs to work.  The man that came to help was really lovely and friendly and helped get tv working . Looking in richardsons brochure later we realised that he was Clive Richardson one of the owners. Just like to say thank you again. You were a gentleman.
"Just back from another lovely holiday on The Broads thanks to Bridgecraft, excellent boats and lovely staff.  Nothing is too much trouble and they cannot do enough for you.  All their boats are well maintained and well presented, looking forward to our next trip in 2018.  Thank you to everyone at Bridgecraft.  Di & Craig x"
