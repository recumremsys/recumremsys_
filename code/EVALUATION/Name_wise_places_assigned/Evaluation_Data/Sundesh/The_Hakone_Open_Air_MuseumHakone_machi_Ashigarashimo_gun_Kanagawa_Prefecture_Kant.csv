"We started our day in the drizzle and explored the large sculpture collection. The grounds are beautiful and the sculptures are nicely spaced and arranged. The pond has a small network of little paths coming off it which take you to various hidden gems. Bring 10 or 100¥ coins to feed the enormous koi! There are bathrooms in several different places through the grounds (by the two children's attractions and the gift shops) and the paths are wide enough to accommodate the traffic. My kids did ok with the scavenger hunt in the Picasso hall (otherwise would have suffered greatly) but they loved playing in the tree of nets but start there, it's gets crowded by 10-11 o'clock. We enjoyed the foot onsen, a nice break from the sculptures and art exhibits. Do this after the stairs up the tower--dont skip the tower, it may look unimpressive outside but it's amazing inside!The water was very comfortable and the seating easily accomodates social distancing (but not wheelchair accessible). We got a beer and some baked gods from the restaurant and it's expensive compared to the states and I've had better food from other food counters at attraction in Japan but the lemongrass beer was good and the muffin vanished even though it was a big dry. Not all spaces are stroller or wheelchair friendly (the tower, the pond, and the star garden) but the indoor exhibits all have access for mobility challenged.We stayed for about 2.5 hours and got lunch at Lawson's and ate in the parking lot (the other restaurants were closed for off season or packed)"
This museum was fantastic. Such a lovely set up with great walking tracks and pathways. Even the fish were a joy to feed. Loved the sculpture for children too.
"Walking by we spot the museum and we were compelled to go inside.   Plenty of large art figures scattered throughout the property.  Highlight is the Picasso works within the museum complex.   Take your time, as the collection covers a long period of his life and is well organized.  Hot day requires lots of water and hat."
"We spent an unexpectedly delightful afternoon, quietly exploring the open air exhibits. Don't forget to view the Picasso museum, you won't be disappointed and the Museum also has a lovely shop as you leave the facility."
Take the time to wonder around and experience this wonderful art destination. It is a beautiful trip up to the location in the mountains and worth the visit for the trip alone. The gallery itself is stunning.
"Our first visit and we thought it was very well done. They have a number of exhibits that kids enjoy, making it a nice place for the family to enjoy together. Disappointed that the Picasso exhibit is closed until July but we’ll just have to go again"
"Loved this place, beautiful artworks in a stunning location. Easy to reach from the train, we had a lovely relaxing afternoon wandering around."
The whole family loved this museum. Such a significant collection of amazing sculptures and the Picasso pavilion is also fab. Loved this place and possibly missed seeing Fuji because we stayed so long. Haven’t seen so many Henry Moore’s in one place and lots of other highly notable artists.
Fairly easy walking park to view the different sculptures.The amazing greenery and tranquil ambience add to the joy of visit. Climb the circular tower near the cafe (< 100 narrow steps) which offesr different views of the park and displays. Treat your feet to warm foot spa (Towel could be purchased to dry off) And a cuppa to round off the venture.
"Beautiful grounds. Several different buildings in addition to the vast outdoor sculpture garden. Picasso exhibit is worth a visit just in its own. Take advantage of the free foot bath. Only negative is that the snacks are quite pricey, not surprising for a museum but just be aware."
"What an amazing place! This is truly a world class attraction with art presented in a beautiful garden setting. Sculptures from local and international artists.It is on the small railway on the way up the mountain, and was a real surprise. Go out of your way to see this is my suggestion. Words can not describe."
Enjoyed the art itself and especially the outdoor setting.  We are not art snobs but experienced a relaxing and fun time walking throughout when the cable car was closed and some slight rain.  It was not too crowded as were here after school started.
"Spent a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours wondering around the grounds taking in all of the delightful exhibits.  There is something for everyone, including some 300 Picasso pieces in a dedicated building. Even on a rainy day we just grabbed an umbrella and went for it.....enjoy!"
"Great pathway. Easy walk. Amazing sculptures and presentation. Wonderful photo ops. A large cafe in the center with a foot bath just outside the door. It was hot and humid outside—so a warm foot bath was not so alluring. Closes at 5pm, which was ok - but as we made our way out, guided to the gift shop, they shoooed us out! Come on! If the outside museum closes at 5:00, then the gift shop needs to stay open till 6pm. We didn’t buy a thing because of that!"
A cooling day to get inspired by the nature and art and was inspired to take lots of pictures and highly recommend to visit open museum if you at Hakone. Bring kids to get educated through play!
"Did not really know what to expect but it was fantastic. The open air aspect wonderful, lots of Henry Moore sculptures and many other wonderful sculptures too. Definitely worth a visit."
Loved this museum. Had a great time wondering through the park-like exhibit. The Picasso section is being renovated but they have it in a temporary location so don’t fret.  Walking distance from the station. Don’t forget to use your Hakone pass to get a small discount.
Breathtaking large scale art in the most beautiful setting. Loved being able to sit in the footbath onsen half way round . Even though the museum was buzy with visitors- it was still spacious enough to feel you had time and room to enjoy the fabulous works of art . I can’t recommend enough for all ages and all art tastes .
This is a gem. Without any expectations I was surprised about the museum. Very nice and at the time of our visit (Friday at 3pm) not crowded at all. Some very fine sculptures - also not your typical dull ones. go and see!
"Set in beautifully landscaped surroundings, this is a wonderful environment in which to view large modern art sculptures.  If you happen to have beautiful spring weather, then all the better for your experience.  Dress appropriately and be prepared to cover some ground, so good walking shoes are called for.  If your feet get a bit tired, you'll enjoy the foot spa that is on the property.  You'll find many artists represented, including some very well known.  This is a delightful experience if you enjoy modern sculptures."
"We were here on a rainy day and still loved walking around the gardens!  This has to be one of the best sculpture gardens that I have visited with so much to see, as well as an indoor Picasso museum and a stained glass silo to climb.  We had a wonderful day so don't. be turned off by the weather.  Enjoy it if you can!"
"The weather was foggy,overcast and light rain so we hesitated to go to an open air museum but I am so glad we went! This is an astounding museum, beautifully designed and so much to enjoy. If you're an art lover you could spend days here. Many of the installations are experiences. The whole museum is extraordinary. Don't forget to leave time for the digital interaction exhibit at the exit."
Loved this place !!! Everything is so delicately exhibited throughout the beautiful garden. The have some impressive pieces from important world artist. Greaaaaat place to take pics ! Totally worth it !
"This is an amazing museum on top of the mountain, inside the huge volcanic crater. Most beautiful place to visit from a brief trip from Tokyo. For art and nature lover, this a trip of a lifetime. You need at least 2 days to be able to go around this beautiful place.  Recommended"
It is a beautiful museum with a large collection of statues. Modern artists from all over the world. Beautiful indoor collection of Picasso. Mainly ceramics but also some paintings. Climb up the tower for a beautiful view. They have a foot bath so don’t forget a small towel. Not to miss
Spent a few hours here wandering around. The sculptures are all well spread out and each has a little explanation plaque near to it. A good mix of European and Japanese works. We had a 200yen discount with the Hakone free passThe Picasso building is very big and has a lot of sketches and even pottery items made by the artist. You can relax in the hot spring footbath. Really relaxing for the feet The attendant there even took a photo of us and you can purchase a foot towel from the box by the side of the long foot bath. If you have children there is a great play area for them inside a wooden building
We spent about 3 and 1/2 hours walking around and taking fun photos of the sculptures.  Stopped for coffee at the cafe near the Picasso exhibit.  Parking discount to ¥500 was very nice too.
"Perhaps the best museum in Hakone - stroll around the gardens and look at fabulous sculptures by Henry Moore, Brancusi, Leger, Barbara Hepworth, Japanese artist Yoshitatsu Yanagihara and many many others. My favourite was Carl Mille's ""Man and Pegasus"" statue on a huge column. Take a leisurely stroll around on a fine day and immerse yourself in art and nature. There is an indoor collection of Picasso ceramics, although they aren't so interesting."
"I love museums, art, nature, and this place had everything I wanted. Picasso exhibit is a must! Dip your feet in the hot spring water after you are done walking around, it's worth it!"
"An unique museum, just by its name and concept of having exhibits out in open air. A path has been laid out for visitors, so it was an easy experience. A family-friendly place where strollers can be loaned. Visit the Symphonic Sculpture - it looks normal and dark from the outside but turns out colourful from the inside."
"Blown away by the beauty of enjoying art outdoors. This is an incredible day out, in a gorgeous setting, with obviously stunning art. I cannot recommend this higher."
Wonderful experience for all ages. Great display of art in a park setting. Chance to experience some picassos. Beautiful time. Expect to walk and interact with the art. Perfect for school age children
"Great selection of Japanese and international sculpture in a beautiful setting (gardens) set in the mountains. A gem! Loved every moment of my visit. Great facilities, indoor and outdoor. For all ages. And a unique foorbath in which to rest your weary feet. Recommended if you are an art lover!"
Visited the museum when visiting the area with friends. Lovely to be outdoors and enjoying the exhibits.
Located in the heart of Hakone is a spectacular open air museum filled with great outdoor sculptures by the best artists in the world. An outstanding collection of works displayed magnificently between trees and great landscape design. A must go place. Just hope for good weather.
