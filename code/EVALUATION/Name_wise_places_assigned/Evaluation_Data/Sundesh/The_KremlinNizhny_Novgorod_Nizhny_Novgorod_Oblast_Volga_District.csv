You cannot miss Kremlin when in Nizhny Novgorod. It sits on a hill and you get some great views for the walls. Walking around is nice. You can go inside as well though not much to see. But I liked it better than the Kremlin in Moscow. Not full of crowds and changing guards was more enjoyable.
"Take a walk inside the Kremlin wall, enjoying the middle age experiences. Inside the Kremlin will find more..."
"It's a very beautiful Kremlin environment with a breathtaking view on the Wolga and Oka tiver for free!!! Besides that, there are other interesting excibitions you won't regret to visit! Do that you won't regret!"
The walls and towers of the Kremlin are very atmospheric and really do give the city a very special feel. Do not forget to walk the walls and to enjoy climbing on the old military vehicles parked inside the Kremlin grounds.
"The kremlin compound houses the most historical buildings and sights in the city. A visit must include buying a ticket to the armoury. This addition is essential showcasing the best parts of Russian history. The weapons, carriages and suits of armour were a highlight. Without seeing this, there are only a few cathedrals to see. Take a guidebook or rent a guide and go early. The queues to get in are long!"
"if you visit Nizhniy Novgorod, you probably do it for this place. Walk the walls, around the towers, enjoy the view from inside towards Volga and the city, descend towards the lower embankment and the related churches and monuments there, and look how the changes of times have transformed a great place in sometimes not-so-great from. Although this is part of the history, too... Still, a must-see. Just be warned, do not smoke nearby eternal fire - misbehaving there is fined."
"Starting with Kremlin, you can proceed to Annunciation Cathedral, Cathedral Of Assumption Alexandrovsky Gardens, Kremlin Armoury, Lenin Museum, St.Basil's Cathedral.Next Day only, Novospassky Monastery, All Russian Decorative Art Museum, State Historical Museum, State Museum Of Original Art Gorky memorial Museum,you have done justice to your visit.& Yet again , I was lucky to find a most friendly cabbie, Jassor-8968501680, who with little English & collection of 300 + hindi songs (The lyrics comes in English ,with Video-so they understand the drama & passion & can enact with joy), my day went too fast. It was not business for him,but sheer sincerity,  It was "" From Russia With Love ""  for me, totally memorable..."
"Make sure you visit the Kremlin. See it on the outside, see it on the inside, and go trek the wall itself. Yes, it's hard, yes the stairs are huge, but its a beautiful historic landmark with very great views and very interesting information. Cheap too!"
This is the oldest preserved Kremlin in Russia.  The main buildings inside the walls are Saint Sophia's Cathedral and the Novgorod Museum.  Dominating the central area is the elaborate Monument to the thousand years of Russia.
"The Kremlin is the city’s main attraction although the area in itself consists mostly of rather uninteresting government buildings. You come here for the walls and towers, the spectacular view of the Volga (and Oka) , the amazing modern art museum Arsenal (one of the best in Russia) and the charming picture gallery. Take a walk around the walls. Come here to see the sunset or sunrise over Volga and don’t miss the modern art center Arsenal. Beside exhibitions it also has great movie screenings (sometimes original language) as well as the best souvenirs and gifts in town."
"We spend a day exploring the Kremlin.  One thing to remember when you plan this.  There is NO FOOD SERVICE anywhere in the Kremlin walls.  I suppose you could try and leave and then return, but we were not going to risk it!  It is a active current head of state with a lot going on.  Pay attention to the roads and cars!  Understand that nearly every building requires it's own ticket (each at a price).  Our philosophy was, we are here once, it is not the time to get to critical and just go for it!  More detail under specific buildings that are a must see (Amory and Diamond Fund, and Bell Tower)"
"Brilliant free activity.Walk around the old fort. Breathtaking views, at the river confluence (Volga and Oka). Known as the city of military glory. This is its show piece centre."
"This little city within a city is a must do whilst visiting Moscow. There are a lot of buildings, mostly churches, inside that you can go in. We went in 3, which was enough. Don't miss the large bell and canon. The grounds are lovely and provide some excellent pictures over the wall across the city. It was cold but very sunny when we went there which provided us with excellent photos. The armoury is huge but a little dull until you get to the royal gowns and carriages.  The diamond room is excellent, remember to speak quietly to you get told off by the guards! A good tip is go straight to the diamond room, you can buy your ticket for the armoury as you come out, it saves going to the ticket booths."
"When in NN this is a must see. Does not compare to Moscow Kremlin, but the history is interesting.Try not to visit in winter for obvious easons."
Walked all the way along the feeder street from Gor'kovskaya Metro station. Walk to the edge of the escarpment to get the best views of the rivers and the new stadium. There is an interesting collection of WWII weaponry- I think made from the many factories that made this city so important in Soviet times.
Wonderfull museum of Russian art with some good examples of European Art. From medieval icons to Contemporary. Rotari to Rapin to Kandinsky. Guided tours also in English. The museum curators and staff are very nice and kind.
"The center attraction of the city. To reach it, you take the metro and then have a long walk through the beautiful street of Gorskaya (excuse my spelling). Many things to see inside: a small Church, the Mayor office, statue of soldiers, Tanks and old war artillery ...The view of the Volga is also amazing. Be careful it is always colder and more windy there since it is on a hill."
"Historical heart and most beautiful place in this wonderful city. Museums, panoramic view of Volga river, oldest building in the city - Kremlin wall. Take your time, go for a walk. Than to museums or one of the restaurants around."
"A great landmark in the city that you can walk around, spend some time to enjoy the history. Gives spectacular views of the town and the river"
Great place during summer with lots of areas and great views to the river. Makes this dull city much more interesting..
"Nothing gives more pleasure to the average Russian ticket seller or security guard than causing delay and general inconvenience to foreigners, unless it is to do the same to fellow Russians.  Getting into the Kremlin, like anywhere else in Russia, is to experience multiple queues and stupefying bloody-minded bureaucracy.  That said, the churches in the Kremlin are beautiful."
"By being located in the city centre, you will definetely pass this place multiple times, It is historical, with pretty big area to walk. Went here in the winter evening, therefore did not visit exhibitions, however I heard there are more things to do, than just walking around.You also have great views and the feeling of history. Great place for walks!"
visiting from New Zealnd have found the city stunnig in winter. we walked the length of the main streat to the Kremlin fantastic place old military equipment the eternal flame site and walking around outer wals it is a great structure. you can pay 200 RUB to walk two sections along the battle ment and at the end is a museum small but interestig history take your google ap translate it is all in russian. they are passionate about there history. it is well worth a visit
Be prepared to sweat walking and climbing around but it well worth what you'll see! Well mantained beautiful property! Stunning views!
"Hundreds of years old, this is the seat of government within a fortress. Includes a military museum, monument to WWII, and beautiful architecture."
"Worth a visit, glad we had a tour guide to tell us all about the different things. Not a busting lot to see, there is a huge cannon and bell. Don't forget to keep to the paths or you will very quickly be told!!!"
"I enjoyed an excellent tour of this lovely site. Thank you to Tour Guide, Kate. You were very friendly and helpful. There are some fabulous views from up on the walls. It is well worth a visit."
"Don't miss it... It's a must see... If you are a fan of history and appreciate monuments, it's a must... Tribute to war veterans and the inextinguishable fire are highlights..."
