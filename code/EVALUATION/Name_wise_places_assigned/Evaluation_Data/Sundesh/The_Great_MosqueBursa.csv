WEarrived in Bursa and visited this wonderful mosque. We waited whilst the midday prayer service was being held. So many people praying a.even overflowing outside. We waited and had Cay (tea) at on of the street vendors that sold tea to people who waited by the mosque. The mosque is awe inspirig to say ther least.
"Went here with a tour, the guide told us that this is the first mosque in Bursa. It is built with a fountain inside, and it is beautiful. Calligraphies were well-maintained, and it was very clean."
Entering the Mosque was the greatest moment i ever had. Beautiful architecture and cozy environment. Being there almost zohor prayer time. Some of the people are there for talk by the imam while waiting for the prayer time.
"This is the must-see attraction in Bursa. Having already visited mosques in Istanbul, I was expecting this to be similar, but I was cetainly wrong. There was a fountain for ablutions in the middle of the mosque, and the light shone on it from the domed roof above. You had to look closely to see that above the fountain there was actually a hole in the roof. No part of the moque floor was closed to tourists, so you had to be careful to respect those who were praying, but the whole mosque seemed to have a more laid back atmosphere, with children running about, for example. I really enjoyed the vibe and we were able to sit in the mosque and watch what was going on."
Gives a great view of an active Mosque. Ornate and well kept as expected. Right in heart of downtown Bursa.
"A visit to the old town in Bursa is a step into the markets and architecture of the silk road.  Many beautiful suks have been renovated and are in everyday use.  A little too much plastic furniture, but the buzz and atmosphere is great.   The area is overlooked by the fabulous Ulu Camii - unusual for having an indoor fountain.   Stand in the doorway and look in to the Islamic artefacts and out over the entire city."
The walkway through the bazaar ending up to the great Ulu Camii definitely something to savour. The mosque itself has amazing architecture and history behind it is fascinating. Surrounded by great shopping and restaurants this is a must visit. The interior is stunning as well. If lost it is a great point to use as navigation as all taksi and bus will be able to guide you to Ulu Camii.
Came here early in the day out of prayer times so the mosque was quiet. Theres a separate entrance for ladies but you can still meet up inside during visiting hours. There were so many examples of Islamic Calligraphy and i believe our guide said the mosque had like 12 domes. Really beautiful and good that its now a Unesco World Heritage Site.
"Our guide told us about how the Sultan had built a mosque with 20 domes instead of building 20 mosques. The fountain and so much natural lighting in the centre made it special and different from other mosques. The carved pulpit and calligraphy were beautiful too. Being a proper mosque, shoes need to be taken off and ladies' hair covered."
loved the architecture and interiors of the mosque so beautiful! location is in the heart of bursa next to the bursa bazar.
A beautiful mosque full with history and tales of our fore fathers. The Quranic verses are beautiful to look. Be sure to take lots of photos
"The mosque forms part of the daily tours to bursa from istanbul so it's worth a short visit, The most appealing feature is the really old craftsmanship in the actual building and design. It's adorned with exquisite mosaic works and holds a water fountain right in the middle of the prayer area. Take a walk around the old city centre while you're there."
"Having visited many mosques in my travels, this one is unusual in having a fountain in the center.  It had a beautiful interior."
"A very interesting mosque, with huge calligraphy on its interior wall. There's a fountain, for the ablution right in the middle of the mosque. Take a close look at the mimbar/pulpit, there's a carving on the solar system."
"A truly lovely mosque. Be sure to get there outside of prayer times to see it. Very heavily used, and in a lovely setting."
This grand historical  Masjid which  they call it  Ulu Cami is the   beautiful and big mosque in Bursa. surrounded with shopping area   .here you can buy different goods such as fruits . towels bedding sets   any also there is many different restaurants
"A must-see on your visit to Bursa. The architecture is extraordinary and the entire complex has so many fascinating details. As always, avoid arriving at prayer times and dress conservatively. Combine a visit to the Great Mosque with the nearby covered market and the Koza Han (historic silk market)."
Truly something to see when visiting Turkey to gain insight and appreciation for another culture.   Experienced a feeling of good from the people and the atmosphere of the space.   Beautiful workmanship and detail
"Bursa is an amazing city, it was a pity it was our last stop and we could not really enjoy it. The city respects its history and is one of the most important ottoman's place to understand the empire and its importance. Ulu Mosque is unique, the fountain right in the middle makes it a surprise. I really like mosques because they are very peaceful places, but this mosque seems even more special, the lighting and the fountain gives you the feeling that you are outside, very interesting. Being beside the bazaars it is very refreshing to enter and have some peace while all is so busy outside."
"A visit to Bursa cannot be completed without entering this mosque. Visit in the morning, take off your shoes enter the mosque find a place to sit and enjoy the inner piece. Do not be silly to wear leggings, shorts etc."
"The Grand Mosque is a 600 years old building. The small alleys leading to this Mosque are dotted with shops selling clothing, souvenirs, food, etc. Walking to Ulu Camii via those small alleys is an adventure by itself."
It is beautiful as far as mosques go. Hand writings on the wall and overall architecture are amazing . It is open to all. Women and men can enter just to visit. It is customary for women to wear a head scarf when visiting. Do not enter with shoes.
"Stunning architecture ....the mosque is approximately 620 years old. For non Muslims you need to ensure that you covered properly at the entrance there is coverings provided. Pack shoes into a packet . For Muslim men there is wudhu facilities in the centre of the mosque , ladies use the bathrooms outside . There is a beautiful door of the kabaah inside ...pictures are allowed"
Looks very plain from outside but beautiful inside. Can be very busy during prayer time. Worth a visit. Pay attention to the calligraphy on  the wall.
"Words can not describe the beauty and the magic within this great mosque which goes back to over 600 years. Built in Seljuki style during the Ottoman empire. The minute you step in until the last you will be in awe. Its a must see. The architecture with the 2 minarets and 20 domes as well as the interior from calligraphies, carpet, lamps, water fountain for woudu' to name some is simply impeccable."
Beautiful Ottoman mosque with a lovely fountain in the middle. Architecture is stunning. Feeling was amazing.
"As its name calls, it is giant.. Still active for praying... Scarf is needed for ladies.  Surrounding is big bazaar where you can find local foods and souvenirs.."
"When you visit Bursa, Turkey, you must visit this mosque. This mosque is the biggest one in Bursa and a landmark of early Ottoman architecture. this mosque was designed and build by architect Ali Neccar in 1396-1399. It is a rectangular building with twenty domes arranged in four rows of five that are supported by twelve columns. I love to see the fountain inside/in the middle of this mosque. This fountain for worshipers so they can perform ritual ablutions before prayer (taking wudhu before prayer). The dome over the fountain is capped by a skylight which creates a soft light below. Its really beautiful here. The interior of the mosque is amazing with a lot of beautiful Quran calligraphy. There're are many shops, restaurants surrounding this mosque. This mosque is also close to Bursa Bazaar/Market too. Put your shoes in to plastic bag that provided in the entrance of the mosque (free) before entering this mosque. Remain quite inside because this mosque is an active mosque and many people are praying here during the praying time."
"Ulu cami, the Grand Mosque in Bursa, is one of the oldest & holiest  worship center of Turkey which was built in  between 1396-1399 by Bayezid I during the enlargement of Ottoman state. According to  one of the folk legends, Ottoman sultan Bayezid I  prayed for  Allah and promised Him  that Sultan would  build 20 mosques if he was the winner of battle of Nicopolis against to Crusaders in 1396. After the victory, he wanted to build 20 mosques first as he promised but Emir sultan, the great sufi of its time and son-in-law of the sultan, recommended him to build a grand mosque with three gates and 20 domes so Ulu cami was built for this advice. It contains 3 gates, 20 domes, 2 minarets and a fountain in the middle for ablution. The mosque has an excellent apperance, architectural form and location in down downt to reach easily. As soon as someone enters  the mosque from a gate, he/she come across with a holy atmosphere which makes a great  impact as having peace and glory. The eyes catches the calligraphic wall inscriptions in Arabic making a mystic shade and cannot stop looking at the beauties. The mosque has 193 calligraphic wall decorartions written  41 famous calligraphers in 14 different handwritten forms. The inner part of the mosque covers an area of 2215 square meters divided into five main sections. The fountain in the middele of the inner court is the fisr foundation  build in the state and it has been serving to the prayers to clean  their bodies before they devote them to Allah.  Ulu cami is consiredered the 5th holy mosque in Islamic world after Mesjidi-Haram in Mecca, Mesjidi Nabavi in Medina- Mesjidi Aksa in Jaruseelam and Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. Emil Sultan offered to sultan to be built,  Somuncu baba was the first imam and the first calling prayer inviting the people was Suleiman Chalabi. It is believed that Hazrat Khidr-ghost prophet-  has a spirutal office on the right side of   vav calligraphy next to the altar. It is "" must "" to visit in Bursa trip and I hope no one will  miss this holy place."
"This is a great mosque.  Big and spacious with 50 domes as ceiling and great history.  Have to remove shoes but it is carpeted or wear socks if you prefer.  Great they allow pictures to be taken even if people do go there to pray.  As such, this is a great way to enjoy a mosque visit where you can see the day to day activity of people and their faith."
"Ulu Camii (Ulu Mosque) is must if your are visiting Bursa and its Old Town. Take you time inside and observe the details, such as the 20 domes in the ceiling and ablution fountain in the center. The simple beauty of the design."
Visited for the first time and was astonished by the architecture and design. The lighting and colours magnificent. You get free scarf to wear to show respect of other religious places of worship.Upon your visit holy water was given to sip but choice is yours to partake or not. Enjoyed visit to the mosque. Thanks to our tour guide and coach driver.
"The ablutions area is inside the mosque rather than outside, and the fountain is restricted to men.  Don't know what women do.  The best part of this mosque is the calligraphy on the walls.  It is very beautiful."
"Though historic, interior is painted-- so no interesting tiles or other features.  The Koran inscriptions are spectacular though-- along with the scale of the place.  Check the fountain (cesme) outside."
"Much nicer than the blue mosque in Istanbul. Has a lovely fountain in the middle, interesting designs on the walls, a sense of real spiritual community."
