"Visited this place to check it out on our way back from our Country drive. Completely amazing view of the Sunset from the top, and obviously popular time for the locals and tourist to have a late picnic. Quite a romantic setting and can be colder. A lot of tours and outdoor activities to do. We didn't have time to do the tours to the falls but will definitely do it in our next trip.There's plenty of lovely accommodation and restaurants to enjoy. It is definitely worth a trip of at least 2-4 days."
Visited the vineyard on the mountain.  Beautiful place.  Breathtaking scenery.  Had a wonderful time touring the mountain with my kids.
"We recently went to Tamborine Mountain for a weekend stay and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. The drive up the mountain is beautiful and not far from the Gold Coast or Brisbane. Hitting Eagle Heights first, we stopped to do the Gallery Walk and were impressed with the shops, cafes and restaurants. It has a real country, community feel and is extremely popular judging by the number of people walking around.There are lots of food options as well as gifts and gourmet items. The whole atmosphere is lovely (including the houses!). Up higher on the mountain are several great wineries - Mason Eden, Witches Falls (the best) and Heritage Wines to name a few. They are all hosted by great staff who really know about the products they are selling. They also offer memberships which give significant discounts on wines. Three Little Pigs and Mason Eden have great food too and although we did not get to try, the Indian place is also recommended. The Witches Chase Cheese shop is also fabulous.A lot of the hotels/B&Bs are expensive (we paid about $360 per night) but there are camping options and other alternatives but you'll have to do your research as Wotif and other companies don't readily advertise them.Make sure you visit North Tamborine as well as Eagle Heights - there are little pockets all over the place with great places. The Distillery is also a must see and to really engage in the experience, do a rainforest walk - there are maps giving plenty of options. There are even easy walks with wheelchair and pram access.All in all, this was a fantastic getaway and families, couples and children will all find something to enjoy."
Loved this place. Great for nature lovers. Went to 2 waterfalls. Nice food and shopping areas at gallery walk. Also went to the glow worm cave. Very convenient to move around.
There is a lovely viewing spot up here to enjoy watching the sunset. Drive up and see the stunning capture of our Creator entitled as the best artist ever!
Amazing view and small quiet local community. Love the atmosphere. Have been here a few times before and always amazing. You can easily go to the information center and get help to find what you wanna see. Saw the glowworms and it was fascinating. Not that expensive. Worth a drive!
"Visited both tambourine mountain and springbrook. Enjoyable morning in the rainforest ,wonderful water falls."
"We visited the showground markets during our stay here on the mountain... and what a gem. Luckily we got there early... was amazed at the number of people by 10am !! We visited Eumundi earlier in the week, and although I was good, these markets were better. More handmade goodies, more space, and a whole lot more cheer! Check out the wonderful lady selling the great range of her handmade pottery in a variety of colour schemes. Super gifts and so reasonably priced. Ditto the rock lady for the kids... she had a pile of bargains the kids adored. So many get finds here. A must see."
Had a picnic at one of the point lookout and i must it was a very intriguing experience. We had a view of the part of the mountain. Went to Spice of Life cafe to grab a picnic basket and breakfast! I would definitely come here again.
"Beautiful mix of rainforest, galleries, wineries and experiences. Great restaurants. Come watch the para gliders launch off the western side of the mountain and drift over the beautiful Scenic Rim. Leave the Mountain and travel west through the Scenic Rim region enjoying a wonderful mix of food, wine, arts, natural beauty and of course, the local hospitality.  Great photography everywhere."
"Visited Tamborine Mountain on a clear warm winters day. What a lovely place, lots to see and do. Markets were great along with watching the hang gliders. It you are after some scenery don't go to the sky walk, it is much too expensive for what you can get for free from one of the many bush walks."
Took a lazy drive there from Cedar Lake . Some of us went to the Glow worm cave . Had a nice fish & chip lunch at a shop. Then walk around the shops . Tried the ice cream.The mist came in at 3 pm ........ nice
Hiked through the rainforest to Cedar Creek Rock Pools and Curtis Falls. The cascades were incredible! Wish we had more time to spend here. Loved seeing the biodiversity-including the sleeping bats-along the way!
Enjoyed a lovely walk around here. Lots to see and do. Great for the family and lots of fudge shops if you like fudge.
"had a lovely drive up tamborine mountain and enjoyed exploring the many waterfalls and rockpools. had fun walking around the treetop walk and attending the distillery nearby. could easily spend a day or two up here admiring the sights. lots of wildlife, and far cooler than down on the coast. rain tends to set in during the afternoons,"
"A lovely place away from the heat of the coast. Varied things to see and do; Cedar creek for the goannas, shopping in Gallery Walk, back to nature in the Botanic Garden.Great views everywhere."
Was here for an intimate wedding ceremony and was totally blown away by the scenic drive and breathtaking view of the mountains and the nature. Perfect getaway for those who wants to be out of the city for a while. Was there during winter and everything was simply romantic.
"Did the skywalk and was brilliant, and even the drive up there has a beautiful view so make sure you take the time so you can stop and enjoy the views along the way. There are many walking tracks for all levels of fitness. Also make sure you leave time to do the Gallery Walk on the way home, it is street shopping with unique shops. Just be wary that the GPS may take you on a bit of a drive, might pay to follow the signs."
"We visited as part of a full day tour to Lamington. Located 30 minutes drive from the Gold Coast and 40 minutes from Brisbane, Mount Tambourine is popular for day trips - when we went there were several coach parties and it is not a huge place. Gallery Walk has a variety of shops (some catering for locals and others quite quirky and geared to tourists), plus plenty of eateries and several wine tasting venues (our favourite was Heritage Wines). In good weather, the scenery is pretty stunning, but it did feel a bit commercial and touristy."
"Had a great trip to Tamborine Mountain. Had great weather, tour guide was great and there was only four people on the tour."
A great look out spot on Tamborine Mountain in the middle of a great forest. It’s shady so the warm sun does not get into your face and it’s also a quiet little area. The tall trees in the forest makes it a photo worthy spot. Try venturing a little into the trees and there will be a path to a track. A must go spot when visiting Tamborine Mountain.
"Only 20 mins from goldcoast it is a beautiful day trip full of adventure & surprises. Set off for an action packed bush walk and pic Nic adventure in the various rainforest walks that include delightful cascading waterfalls. Or a moderate activity day exploring the tourist shops, antiques, wine tasting or a variety of fabulous restaurants. Go for a day or stay for a few nights as there is variety of reasonable accomodation year round. Recomend the Scottish place to stay. And Clancys Irish pub to eat."
"Visiting family in Helensvale we were told to go and see Tamborine mountain "" it's quite interesting"" an understatement! The first time we went you couldn't see across the road as the clouds had dropped. The second time we went we were rewarded by this ""town""on the of a mountain, everything was there along one Main Street. We went on to the sky walk in the forest, a short circular walk taking you right up into the canopy, a beautiful experience. The cafe is well stocked and the toilets are some of the cleanest you will find. Well done, I suggest they have a visitor book"
"Standing on top of one of the most stunning Mountain scenic outlook views, overlooking the Gold Coast high rise buildings and out to sea. Truly magnificent and amazing experience! Bring your telescopic camera. Great spot to stop off and to soak up the atmosphere to surrounding Coastal outlook.Hope this helps the driving traveller. Hire a good car, we did. A small car is suffice, but a four wheel drive is definitely worth while for sitting up higher off the road while travelling up into the mountain. Its more scenic than sitting lower to the road. You'll enjoy either way. My choice was to sit higher up from the road. Have a wonder half day, or full day trip, travelling up to Tamborine Mountain, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.Hope this helps."
"Guided by GPS, took a drive up from Surfers Paradise on a Friday morning 2 weeks ago. Was cool all the way up windy, narrow road. Did not switch on aircond of car. Traffic wasn't heavy. We covered Skywalk (got lost with GPS initially), only 2 shops at Gallery Walk as we were rushing for lunch at Polish Place and then a visit to Nathan Winery for wine tasting with cheese. Wasn't able to visit Glow Worm cave as time does not permit. Street parking is plentiful and free at Tamborine Mt."
"The drive was very pleasant with lots of lovely scenic views. Not too far from the Gold Coast for a real tree change. Disappointed by the 'galleries' on the mountain. Largely filled with the same old crap available at most weekend markets. Very little truly original, locally made artisan products. Nothing I haven't seen before, but cheaper."
Headed up on a Tuesday for a scenic walk and ended up staying for lunch. We live only 30 minutes from Tamborine now but this was only the second visit. Already looking forward to going back again to try out other beautiful circuits.
"Beautiful part of the gold coast. Loved the Gallery walk,bought great cheese from the factory shop. Moonshine madness liqueur which I have search for and had a lovely walk through Thunderbird park. Lovely day and then had a lovely nights sleep up there too."
"Stopped at the hang gliding spot and the view was simply awesome, take off your shoes, walk in the grass and then take a seat and just enjoy the moment. I definitely am going back to see this again. Loved the whole area."
Played Tamborine Mountain Golf Course yesterday with my two friends and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We only had time to play 9 holes (it is a 9 hole course anyway) but found it remarkably easy to walk despite it being quite hilly.  Some really interesting holes and I would like to play it again before I finish my holiday.  After golf we took a walk to Curtis Falls - one of the smaller waterfalls in the area. We enjoyed the walk through the amazing trees.  We ended up taking a walk down the main road and into the many gift shops - many had the usual touristy tat but several had some really nice/unusual items.  I bought a lovely blue glazed bowl for a gift made by a local potter.  There were plenty of eateries and parking.  The road from Tamborine back to Tweed Heads is not for the faint hearted though!
Didn't expect so many fun things to do in the mountain.  We took a nice drive to Tamborine Mountain on a beautiful Sunday morning and came across the school market where we enjoyed a walking breakfast with burgers and coffee.  Then we went for a nice skywalk whick took about 45 minutes.  The tasty late lunch at a cozy cafe in the village nearby put our first mountain explore to a perfect end!
This was a great escape on our last day of our holiday.  Be warned it is much cooler up in the mountains!  The gallery shops were good full of lots of different kinds of things to buy.  Nice selection
Was a hazy day when I was there so the view from the top was not as spectacular as it would have been on a clear day.  Some of the mountains closer to Brisbane actually give you better views.
"We visited today and did the Curtis Falls walk (a separate review) which was a good, easy walk.  Cameron Falls off Knoll Rd is a longer walk with a lovely lookout & picnic spot at the entrance.  I would say it's for average fitness levels.  The falls themselves were a bit more of a trickle - would be better after rain!  We completed the circuit in under an hour.  I wouldn't recommend the circuit for prams or wheelchairs - lots of stairs and uneven paths.  Good pathways in general though.  Wear comfy shoes, the number of people I see walking these tracks in thongs (flip flops) is crazy! Plenty of parking but the entry/exit road is one way you beware/give way to oncoming traffic.  A nice day trip from Brissie or the Goldie."
"I love Tamborine Mountain. There really is something for everyone. Enjoy beautiful rainforest walks, have lunch on the mountain at St Bernard's - soaking in the amazing views, visit the wineries and sample their wares or time your trip for the markets on Sunday and stay the night in a B&B (with a view, of course!). There's adventure parks with high/low ropes, tree top walks and glow worm caves.  It can be very busy ( much loved) so start your day early!"
