"Great place for day hike, sunrise and sunset. Don’t take the car, hike up from walking path. Sunset is better then sunrise."
Nothing beats to get hill. Sunrise and view of mountains in the morning.. You can travel. Miles just to. See this natural wonder..
I have travelled a lots of place and seen beautiful natures. The reason saying because sun rise is very hard to witness from all places. This is a spectacular experience of life if and only if weather is with you. I was very lucky because there was not a single obstacle to see Kanchaunjanga even one local person showed me mt everest after sunrise. I would suggest not to bring people who has heart issues specially old and very little kids. Because while returning one old man got sick and they say its normal there. Best time is around march april. But again all on your luck. There are various vehicles at early morning 3.30 am from Darjeeling main junctions. Please go early as lots of crowd and if you are at back of them then cant visualize the begining beauty. Enjoy
"The sky create colour patterns with beam of sunrise. This is the beauty and a must visit place for darjelling. One need to compromise morning nap however, place worth it. Starts at 4.00am from hotel and reach the place at 4.30am. Every second is worth to wait for sunrise. Pulse of colour beam created a mesmerising view of highest peak of India. People gathered here like crazy and hawkers selling winter clothes , tea coffee for your sake of interest. Do visit this sun rising point in east India."
Go early and you get best view of Kanchenjanga Sunrise!!. You will be disturbed by locals selling goodies and teas. That you have to ignore it. Make sure you go early and take a camera. Best profile pics can be taken there.
Good place to visit during day time. Not sure about early morning visit here. Heard that this place is too crowded & freezing cold during that time. So we preferred to visit this place by 10-11 AM. It was a wise decision. No crowd at all. We have seen Mt.Kanchenjunga clearly & a portion of Mt.Everest. Yeah. Mt.Everest will be visible from here on a clear day. I was more excited to see Mt.Everest than Mt.Kanchenchunga as we can see Mt.Kanchenjunga from most of the places in Darjeeling city.Mt.Kanchenjunga slowly changes its shade (kind of light blue to yellow) slowly when Sun raises. We saw this from our hotel balcony itself. Am not so interested on sunrise.
Saw them for the first time in my like. I was happy like a kid.. shivering in 2 degree.. please carry enough woollen cloths so that you don’t become ice. There will be a lot of people at the location so take place facing mountains.
Too many people for one sunrise. Saw the rising sun with 2000 people. Can be managed better by the state government.
Nice place to see the sunrise. Have to reach here by 5am to see the 5.30am sunrise. IF there are too many clouds then sunrise wont be visible.
"Fact No. 1: Tiger Hill has tourist attraction for it being a spot to observe sunrise. It's a awesome place to do that. Alongside the entire Kanchenjunga range is open for majestic view.Fact No. 2: The time of sunrise on most days is between 5:30 to 6:30am. So anyone wanting to catch the glimpse, has to be there by 6 am. Meaning, you leave your lodging at 3:30 am if you are based at Darjeeling. (Its a lot to ask for when you are on a vacation)Fact No. 3. Your experience is entirely dependant on the clarity of the weather. The weather is clear mostly in the months between Oct and January (as told by my escort driver). We visited in the month of May and the clouds didn't let us see a ray of sunshine !! :-(Fact No. 4: The months of May and June - which are the days of maximum tourist ascent towards Darjeeling - would make you end up in huge traffic jams and loss of precious time - once you embark on the descent from the Tiger Hill. Lots of cars are parked jamming the way down from the hill. We waited 2 hours in traffic just to get down the hill. Hugely disappointing !"
Good view for sunrise from the peaks of Kanchanjunga. Have to leave early to reach there as roads toward observatory is narrow and chances are there that you can stuck in traffic jam. Try and reach there by 4 am so that you can find good place to watch the sunrise. Road towards tiger hill is very senic.
"Left hotel  at 4 am to reach Tiger hill at 4.30  to find about 1000 people already occupying all the vantage points  and facing   the cloud covered horizon in the direction of the mountains. Our taxi driver had already doused our excitement during our drive  saying that we would be extremely fortunate to get a view of the Kanchenzonga in this season. He also told us that more than 1500 taxis mostly SUVs would be jamming the narrow approach roads and we had to return back at once to escape the jam.Well, it took us over 2  hours to get back even though we had turned back at 5.15."
"At high altitude, you will feel amazing ride as you need to leave hotel at 4am in morning.you need to wait for 2 hrs to see sun shine. as it is very crowded. go early park your car at top location and choose best place to witness sunshine. Take heavy woolen clothes,But after 4 hours when sun will start rising you will see beauty sky is covered with red, golden light.you will see half sky in dark half in light . sun rising from mountains enlighten kanchanjunga peak at back side. and sun looks like a sphere ball  Take some coffee to comfort you cold.Please dont make any video/image as you can get the same many on tripadvisor just witness whole with bare eyes and get indulge in beauty,"
"Situated at top, get up at 4 and rush to the hills in your cab. Don't miss the the view of sunrise and hills all around..."
"Heard the name several times since last several years. This time after visit it appeared to be illusive hill and frequently it is striking my mind to visit it again at the earliest possible. Truly it is a nice spot for every visitors and the ""SUN RISE"" is inexpressible."
Tiger Hill is the place to view the amazing sunrise. but have to reach here by 5am anyhow. leave hotel by 3:30am because you can get a traffic jam in the way due to large number of tourists.
"Tiger hill, the very hyper place can be visited only when there is no cloud, which is very rare as the place is always covered with a layer of white blanket. Try to go in the right season to avoid fog and mist. You need to start by 4:30 am max to witness the sunrise and see the Kanchenjunga. It would take approx. 30 mins to reach the point. Be prepared to walk uphill to the top (another 20 mins walk). From the top, you can see magnificent view.Do remember to wear warm cloths, as it be would be quite cold up there. Girls are recommended not to wear heels as it would be difficult to walk through."
U need to get up at 3.30 and leave by 4.30 to reach this place located on hills and ur local can driver will negotiate deadly turn and twist to reach this place . Be careful what u carry here wear proper clothes jackets mufflers hand gloves head cap and thermals . Proper shoes recommended u get heavy winds in this area. Hope and pray u get clear weather for this coz when we visited it was a bit cloudy . I get coffee and other cover up on rent but it better u get prepared. Move early to avoid block of cars on way to hill has steep walk as well.
Very cloudy morning so we barley seen the sun behind the clouds. I would omagine its an excellent view point for Hymalayas and the country side. Journey was comfortable with our driver for the dsy. Need to get an entry token . Several hackers selling warm clothing ang hot sugary coffee.
"Tiger Hill is a very popular point to view the sunrise among the majestic Himalayas in Darjeeling. The sunrise was around 4.57 AM and one has to leave Darjeeling by 4 am to catch the sunrise. The roads are poor and the traffic management is absolutely nil. In peak tourist season like May, you may have to walk more than 1.5 km from the parking spot due to the rush, The actual viewing spot itself is in bad shape with broken railings and garbage all around. There is no control on the crowds and it can be really frustrating if you want to have a personal pic. the Sunrise event was a great scene and to see the Sun coming out as a small peck and grow into a full circle was a brilliant viewing experience !! However, it started raining soon and then due to the traffic mismanagement we were stuck there for 45 min. Go if you have patience to view the sunrise in spite of poor infra ..."
"Tiger Hill is a decent nice scenic beauty hill about 8,000ft approx. Before going this spectacular place plz. collect detail representation of this place for affordable view the landscape and the monasteries. You could be also access to this place by jeep/car and obviously in the clear daylight. If you have foreign national friend in abroad state it's easy to comply there. You have to gotta be safe there if it is rain. Remember drink plenty of water/juice to avoid altitude sickness. You may conduct also family moments within family ties there very well bcoz there is no vulnerable matters. Spend time for this outstanding view of Khangchendzonga snow capped mountain and other high hills over there. I trust that above information will be helpful.....R. Rahman"
"Started from our hotel at 0430 in the morning, got up at 0345 hrs from sleep, that too in the month of December.The driver charged Rs 1200/- for the trip. Even in the morning hours, there was huge rush and vehicles were going to Tiger Hill in hordes. There was traffic jam also. Sunrise was at 0620 hrs. The climb was in total darkness. On reaching near the top, the Bolero we were travelling in could not go anymore as cars were parked on the road sides. We also got down and started walking, you have to be fully dressed up in winter clothing with woolen caps,gloves, inners,sweaters etc to fight the cold. After a steep and slow climb of around 10 minutes, we reached the top. Already it was overcrowded. There were two sets of people - One set only looking at the Kanchenjunga and the other looking towards the east waiting for the sun to appear. Local women were selling coffee. There was a half constructed structure there which is planned as an observatory but work is not complete. People had climbed that unfinished structure also. One person suddenly fell forward and became unconscious. Four - five people including me started to warm him up, he seemed to be all alone. Blood trickled down his lip and we were all getting nervous. After about 5 minutes of massaging, he regained consciousness and his group members also found him. It was an unnerving experience. Meanwhile, the sun appeared and was greeted with a loud cheer. The weather was clear. The Kanchenjunga started changing color and it seemed that somebody was pouring molten gold from its peak, white turning to gold. Lots of fotos were taken. We went trudging back down the road looking for our driver who drove us back.Summary - No administrative arrangements where so many people ( old and young ) visit everyday. No parking space, parking was haphazard and indisciplined. No proper observatory. God only knows when that half finished structure will be completed. No clean toilets.Was thankful to come back. Like all other things in Darjeeling, only the beautiful Kanchenjunga saved the day for us."
Fabulous view of the sunrise on Kanchenjunga Mountain from Tiger Hill. Very early start and plenty of transports going in that direction. If you find yourself in Darjeeling it's worth the early wake up to see this spectacular event. Visited in Oct 2012.
"Go to this place around 4 am. Pre sunrise scene should not be missed. however, be prepared for a long traffic jam. Must visit."
Traffic is a mess. Massive crowd and really nothing special. Can give it a miss. Seen better sunrise moments but that's just my opinion.
One of the most famous spots in Darjeeling is Tiger Hill. The place is famous for watching Sunrise and as well as Mt. Kanchenjunga. The place remains cold almost throughout the year hence one must be wearing Warm clothes from top to buttom. Hand Gloves are necessary. One require permit to go the Tiger Hill.
Early morning 4 am never seems to be this beautiful. We started from our place around 4 am in the morning and reached the hill at 4:40 am. Breezy wind and freezing cold. Shivering and trembling we reached the top of the hill. We waited for almost an hour for the sun to come out and look at us. What a beautiful sight it was!. The sun and the moon both were together and loved the moment spent with them. Its a must visit place.
Try to be early there and ask the tea sellers about direction in which you can see Kanchanjangha. You need to focus on Kanchanjangha not on sunrise. If you are lucky you will see peak of Kanchanjangha in orange colour even before you can see sun from the hill. The local story goes like this that sunrays first bow to the sacred hill and then give light to the world.
"Due to unexpected cloudy weather in Darjeeling, there was fog all around and we could not see the sunrise on Kanchenjunga. Even by noon, due to cloud cover, there was no visibility. Construction of an observatory is going on. Do not bother visiting if the weather is cloudy - find out from the locals about the same. Overall, a disappointment. The road is quite steep, with a short narrow stretch."
It's crazy hoe popular this place is for sunrise...most guides arrive just after 4am for  a630 sunrise so it's freezing cold whilst you wait. There are the usual stalls selling beanies/ gloves and of course chai wallahs. The sunrises and slowly the peals on the mountains are illuminated.... it's really beautiful to see (aside from the throngs of people there).Do NOT attempt to use toilets there- they are revolting! Go in a bush before the sun comes up.
"Spectacular sunrise watching location that offers a beautiful view of Darjeeling Town, the rolling mountains and the Himlayas. On a clear day you can see all the big mountains including Everest. Be sure to get there early to get a good spot at the front. Expect crowds though as this is THE spot to watch the sunrise."
By far the highlight of our holiday...just to see the first rays of sunlight on the mighty Kanchenjunga was an unforgettable and priceless experience. Go early at least 2 hours before sunrise to both get a good spot and parking space!!
"This is some experience. Getting up at 3 in the morning and travelling to the top most point of Darjeeling to view the beautiful Sun rise and the Gigantic Mount Kanchanjungha. It was so cold up there, feet’s freezing. But the other experience was above all. Sharing photo’s."
I went there alone leaving my family at the hotel. I began at 4am from the hotel by taxi. Reached the tiger hill 45mins. It was very crowded and the driver parked the car much ahead of the hilltop. But it was very unfortunate that it wasn't a clear day. Full of clouds and couldn't see any bit of the sunrise. The crowd was disappointed too but it was an experience to have at least tried. My advice would be to go to the tiger hill in day time when the Sun is up and sky is clear to get a view of the mountain and enjoy the valley view also. Don't take elderly people and  small kids there as they have to walk steep and face cold weather during sunrise...
"The best part of Darjeeling trip was the sunrise view at Tiger Hills. Seeing the fog the previous days , we thought we will miss it . But we were lucky . The view was just awesome"
