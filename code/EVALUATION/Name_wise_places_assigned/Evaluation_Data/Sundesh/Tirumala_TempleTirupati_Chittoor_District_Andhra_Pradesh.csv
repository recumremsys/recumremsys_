One of the top most visited temples visited by Indians.Well maintained. Do book seegra darshan if possible for quick darshan. Helpdesk counters set up at every nearby points to help you with you query.
One of the frequently visited and richest temple in South India. Book your darshan tickets well in advance to have mersmerizing darshan of the Lord.
I visit Tirumala temple almost every 2 years. Excellent management. Booked darshan ticket online @Rs 300/- per Head. Earlier we had one issue that Shoes have to deposited near entry of temple and exit is different side. So one needs to go back again to collect the Shoes. Now TTD has made arrangements so that shoes can be taken back near exit and this saves time and hassles.
The temple trek uphill is a great way to have darshan and a extended family comprising of 16 members from 14 to 70 years walked all the way. It was difficult but all enjoyed with good company. Had a delicious breakfast and waited for our turn for the darshan. After seeking the blessings of Lord and donating part of our earnings again has prasadam. It was a rather quick journey as we started at 6.00 AM and finished collecting our share of ladoos by 12.00 noon Happy to be blessed
Take a bus or train from Bangalore or Chennai. You have walk for 8 km from bus stand or you can travel by bus . You have stand for at least 4-6 hrs in line.lodoos are amazing.
"Amazing place, people and experiences every time I visit this temple. Has its own vibes which are difficult to put into words but am sure worth a visit.Bought the Rs. 300 ticket and the darshan was over within 2.5 hours. So if you have less time, then VIP lane is best bet. I suggest try weekdays and you may get the darshan done within less than 2.5 hours."
"One of the best temples and most importantly the city is clean..Important 1. Pre book VIP Darshan ticket INR 300 per person which also includes 2 Prasad ladoo free.2. Pre book your stay with the Tirumala. The Tirumala trust rooms as u will not find any other private accommodations options near by the temple.3. Book OYO if you have to stay at Tirupati for a night halt. Private rooms are just worst.4. It will take 1 hour from Tirupati to reach Tirumala where there is the main temple.5. Bags, mobile phones are not allowed in temple same as all big temples.At last the Darshan is divine.. best of bestJai Govinda Govindaa Govindaaaaaa Regards Tarun SamvediVirar Mumbai"
"Best temple in India/World, despite heavy footfall temple and 7 hills are maintained very well. You should be prepared to spend at least 3-4 time in the queue for darshan. Do not hesitate to ask for assistance from volunteers as they are very helpful"
"I went for Tirupati-Tirumala darsan with Karnataka tourism packaged tour. They offer accommodation for fresh up, VIP darsan ticket and 2 laddoo prasad each person, within the package. It took almost 3 hours even in VIP darsan queue. But you forget all the waiting and time taken once you get darsan of lord Balaji. Maintain the dress code: Dhoti and shirt or Kurta pajama for men                                        Sari or salwar with dupatta for women"
Fully devotional.must follow ethics at temple. Darshan took two hours. Advise online booking for darshan.felt peaceful and blessed.Very powerful God and must visit temple.  Wonderful temple with huge campus.
I went with the tamilnadu tourism one day trip. They were well organized and with the corporation of other passenger the day went well. The trip starts at 5 am at wallajah road chennai. Important things to carry photo id proof and tickets if booked online collect your tickets before you go to the bus. I had a name change which I did over the phone 2 days prior to the trip.  They give you a cute jute bag with a packet of biscuit and water. The guide Mr.Sridhar and pilot Mr.Arul were very helpful. The darshan I went was in March exam time so I guess that was a reason for less crowd.. The darshan was divine.the blessings I got was magical... you will just melt seeing balaji. Am felt so blessed to be there.. please visit balaji to get better changes in your life ... temple was clean.. plenty of water available to drink.. The nature resources are preserved.. you can see few animals on the way... beautiful for your eyes... mind and soul...
"Visited on 6th april 2019. The access roads to and from the temple are excellent. Collected free sarvadarshanam tickets at tirupati rail station which is a nice idea for the available 3 pm slot. Reached the temple at 2.30pm. Completed darshan at 7.30pm. 5 hrs for darshan was very tiring especially as the rows were very crowded. Had to wait 45 minutes at the prasad coupon buying counter prior darshan as there was complete chaos. No rows,people jostling and fighting. After that we reached a large hall. There were several other halls like that. All packed to capacity with us having no knowledge what lay ahead. Somebody informed that from this hall onwards it will take another two hrs for darshan. After one hr of waiting the hall gate was opened and people rushed madly until we reached another narrow waiting area fully packed and people still jostling to move as forward a position as possible. After half an hour again we started moving and reached barricaded rows and moved thru them for another half an hr. Then we had beautiful darshan of the lord. The temple was beautifully decorated and there was divine aura around the place. After darshan till exit again there was pushing and jostling.There is lots and lots of scope for improvement if it indeed is the richest Hindu temple. There is no crowd management or neither any safety measures around. It is a disaster waiting to happen due to any inadvertent mishap as the areas r very crowded and management is not visible.Some people were saying that Rs 300 VIP darshan is easier but we could not book them as it gets booking starts 3 months in advance."
"It's been great time and enjoyed the stay in tirumala which is the cleanest and peaceful place. Visited places like Papavinasanam, Aakasha Ganga also. It's very good."
"I visited in Sept 2018 with my family, without any reservation / VIP ticket. We visited sriniwas to get the tickets and got the Sarvdarshan ticket for same day at 9:00PM. we reached at 8:00Pm and Got entry at 8:20PM. We are lucky that there are not much people and we get clear and good darshan in 2 hours and specd 1 hour for parsad. We get free in 3 hours. We are lucky to good and fast darsharn.Please note that for avoid rush / crowd:1. Try to go in week day rather then weekend 2. Do not carry anything with you (mobile / bag) as this will save time to deposit at counter. Keep it in Cab / hotel Only3. Man can wear Pant-shirt / Kurta payjama /Dhoti and women can wear Saari & Suit.4. Try to go for  Night darshan 5.Take SarvDarshan Ticket in place free-pass. Sarv Darshan is again Free given you on the basis of Adhaar Card."
"I would like to share my Tirupati experience so that others visiting in near future gets a benefit. This can answer many questions which one can have in mind before planning their visit. 1.	We had booked Special Entry Darshan tickets online at TTD website 2 months prior to our visit. Ours was 11 AM slot on Saturday.  People suggest avoiding weekends and public holidays to avoid major rush2.	We stayed in Tirupati where we got a good hotel with comfortable stay and good restaurant 3.	On the day of arrival we visited Govindrajswami temple in the heart of Tirupati. We had to go through a quite a long queue here also.4.	Next morning we started for Tirumala by cab in the morning at 8:20 AM. We reached at the top at 9:20 AM. We were following the traditional dress code. Kurta pajama and Salvar kurta with Dupatta.5.	The driver dropped us at the parking near Varaha Swami temple6.	We then visited Pushkarini Tirtham and Varaha Swami temple and returned back to the car7.	The driver then dropped us near Special Darshan Entry gates. We left our footwear and mobile phones in the car, to avoid the queues at the locker and save time. I just had a small sling bag to keep money and some biscuits. We also had a water bottle. You can carry a purse but it is difficult the manage in queue.8.	We had to walk for 5 mins to the entry point where our tickets were checked and we were allowed to enter. It was 9:45 AM. The people from time slots later than 11 AM had to wait outside9.	We then passed through a security check. Our tickets and ID proofs were checked here. Then we were asked to get lined up in a small queue. I guess only few of us were allowed to join the queue. People coming later were asked to wait in the waiting halls where there were chairs to seat.10.	Our queue was quickly got merged with the Sarvadarshan queue. And then started a big rush. People do not believe in queue discipline there. Everyone tries to push and go ahead of you and there is no one to control this queue. This is a wide queue so queue discipline is not maintained by default.  There is no place to seat in this queue.11.	Initially the queue was slowly moving but then it stopped completely for some time. Then again it started moving slowly. After passing through several halls and a staircase, we entered the main temple complex.12.	And finally we reached the temple entrance. Where the large golden pillar is there. Once you reach there, means you are very near to the actual deity. 13.	Then the queue was broken into multiple parallel queues. And now finally you can see the deity. It is dark inside so you really need to focus to get the darshan. You get a chance for darshan only for 4-5 seconds so do not waste the opportunity in looking somewhere else otherwise in no time you will be out and miss the opportunity. We were outside the temple at 11:05 AM14.	Once you come outside you will find directions to go to the laddu counter where you can get your laddus. You have to walk a few meters bare footed to go till the laddu counter. So if you are in a group, few people can choose to wait instead of everyone going to the laddu counter.15.	300/- ticket includes 2 laddus for each person. You can also buy extra laddus online at the time of ticket booking or you have to buy a laddu coupon again standing in the queue. You need a bag or container to keep the laddus, so better to keep one clean bag with you to avoid the second queue for buying laddu covers. And then you have to stand in a third queue to get the laddus, after showing your ticket or a coupon 16.	Getting into the queue or waiting inside the waiting hall and the waiting time required is all depend upon various factors, like number of pilgrims visiting that particular day, your darshan slot, etc. Also, the darshan schedules vary depending upon the day of the week you are visiting, so I cannot comment on how much time it will take for you but we were lucky to get the darshan in 1.5 hrs. People say that it takes at least 3 hours for special entry darshan.  We required total 3 hours at Tirumala.17.	We returned back the Tirupati and then visited the Padmavati temple and our Tirupati yatra was complete."
We visited the temple in peak season in a weekend. Suggest one to plan well in advance if travelling with family.
"Please dont visit tirupathi !!! Full Money minded ' from my childhood i visited around 60-80 times .

"Divine place to be visited. One of the most popular and beautiful temple. Located in Tirupati, Andhra pradesh. Pilgrims donate their hair to lord Vishnu and goddess Neeladri before entering the temple. It is considered to be the most sacred ritual of the temple. ritual revolves around the story where Lord Venkateswara was hit on his head by a shepherd, a small portion of his scalp became bald. This was noticed by Neela devi,with her magic she cut a portion of her hair and implanted it on his scalp. Lord Venkateswara noticed her sacrifice. As hair is a beautiful asset of the female form, he promised her that all his devotees who come to his abode would offer their hair to him, and she would be the recipient of all the hair received. Hence, it is believed that hair offered by the devotees is accepted by Neela Devi.Information:Compulsory to take tickets before entering the temple. Two types of tickets are available. One Special darshan which is Rs. 300/- can be booked before 2 months online or Can be purchased in any of the ticket booking offices in Tirupati. Second, General ticket can also be bought that is free known as Sarvarjanik Darshan ticket which can bought from same ticket booking office. Expect waiting of minimum 4 hours for Darshan.Note: Try to take the tickets as early as possible from the office because all type of tickets gets over by 9am and then pilgrims have to wait till other day morning.Pilgrims can enter the temple only on the timings mentioned in the tickets. Before that they cannot enter the temple.Accessibility: Buses run to and fro from night 2am till 12am from Tirupati till main Temple. Ticket: rs 55/- one way. Last bus which comes is at 12 am. After 12 am no vehicles are allowed to go down.For internal transition free bus services is provided.Food(Prasadam) is available during waiting time.Duppatta / Chunni is compulsory.Have a nice Darshan.Date of experience: November 2019"
Visiting Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala has become more comfortable with new facilities. Now you can expect the darshan is completed within 2 hours on a normal day in Rs 300 category. Waiting and handling of pilgrims has become much better.
"This is one of the most visited temple shrines in India.  The temple is always crowded in all seasons.  Make sure you book you stay in advance to take advantage of the facilities provided by the temple trust, amenities like the stay and food are pretty decent for any type of visiter"
"This Temple is really an astonishing one in the world.. Every day around 20,000 to 50,000 people from all over India come here to offer their prayers and pray for their welfare.. Clean and excellent facilities are provided for the devotees and simply excellent work is done by people who are working here.. Actually, ""People work here "" - This phrase is not correct..To say really, ""People dedicate themselves in their duty"". Yes,  this is correct (in my view,  the service done by the people working in this Temple administration here is really incomparable).. You should first visit01. GovindaRaja perumal temple in the foothills of tirupati city.. 02. Then worship the kapileswarar temple and take a holy dip in the kapileswarar theertham  In the hills, 01. Varahasamy temple in the bank of pushkarani 02. Pray the hanuman Temple in front of the temple next.. 03. Then you should enter the line to worship Lord venkateswara.. Have a great Darshan and feel Blessed.."
"When you visit Tirumala for Lord Balaji's blessings you must be prepared to spend 2-3 hours in the process of darshan. While there are options to stay the night, there are more options in Tirupati. Electronics, cameras are not permitted so please secure them in a safe place before visiting the shrine. Recommended to carry drinking water. It can get difficult for infants. Please prepare accordingly. Dress code is strictly enforced. Only India wear, it is also defined on the rear of the ticket. The Tirupati ladoos are my all time favourite. It is good to plan in advance and book the Rs 300/- special darshan ticket including paying for the ladoos."
Had nice darshan after 5 hours been in the queue and waiting hall. Had delicious sambar rice and hot milk while in the waiting hall. Overall fantastic trip
I visited the temple few days back... Took a sarvdarshan ticket one day before and been able to have a darshan... Even it took 4 hrs to have the darshan but it was worth it
"This place does not require any introduction and is one of most sacred place in Hinduism. Place is thronged by Hindus from all over the world in large numbers. There are long queues for the Lord's 'Darshan'. Considering the number of people visiting the temple everyday, the overall arrangement made for the pilgrims is very good. While visiting the temple, the 'Laddus' which has the Geographical Indication Tag and are distributed as 'Prasad' are not to be missed."
"Probably the most visited temple in India, and certainly the best organised as far as devotees are concerned. We visited it in January 2019, having booked sheegra darshan a month earlier.we were lucky to get a 4 PM slot. We went in at 3:45 PM and were out after darshan at 7:00 PM.  The process was very well organised and controlled considering the number of devotees waiting. We came out satisfied spiritually and emotionally. Three hours in queues may be tiring, but everything was orderly and well regulated. There were drinking water points, restrooms. and places to sit and wait. being seniors we were tired at the end, but have no complaints.We were advised not to go during school holidays as the number of devotees would be much bigger. I think that was a valid advice.I do not think a wheelchair bound person could manage what we did. Maybe there are special routes for them with ramps and elevators."
This is one of the richest temples in the world. You would expect better crowd management. It seems the temple management is artificially creating chaos and frenzy by not allowing people into the temple on a continuous basis. Seems like a scam to create difficulty for devotees who come to get a view of Lord Vekateshwara. You will end up waiting 7-8 hours for a 2 second view of the lord's statue. Very bad crowd management with no consideration for senior/disabled/children/sick people.
"Tirupati temple is always crowded with devotees. Still, you can find less-crowded days such as a weekday, non-festival day and less popular timing of late afternoon. The combination worked for us and we enjoyed our darshan experience.Suggested timing: Lunchtime (1 PM onwards)Suggested Day: Mon-ThursdayWe could finish our darshan in 2 and a half hours and had a delicious Anna Prasadam followed by tonsuring. There was absolutely no crowd and you could run with ease.A sample plan-------------------    Book the special darshan tickets at least a month in advance. Choose a weekday and non-festival day to expect a lower crowd.    Choose a time for darshan and try to reach before that. The special darshan queue has a slot based system and you should follow your slot.    We had planned to use a personal vehicle for travel and it had many benefits such as shorter travel time, ease of keeping stuff (bags, footwear, phones etc). Besides we would visit Shri Kalahasti Temple too.    After reaching Tirumala hilltop, you need to report at the ATC Car parking area as mentioned on the darshan ticket. Alternatively, always ask the duty policemen for any direction.    You must leave all the electronics and bulky items. There are lockers just as the entry of the special darshan point.    Carry a printout of the darshan ticket as you would not have access to phones. In case you forgot to carry a hard copy, there is a printer shop. Ask policemen for direction.    You can carry water, food and small stuff for kids and yourself in a backpack. It will be screened multiple time, so please leave all electronics and metal items in a locker.    You would need to follow the route which has many rooms joined by metal corridors.    It is a well-maintained route, with good ventilation, and wall-mounted fans. The queue has max 2 people width so looks safe.    Never run while waiting. Just stay calm and try to be on the sides of the queue.    There are toilets on the way. The only problem is that you would use them bare-foot. And there is no soap so you should carry it.    In a few hours, you would reach the main temple.    After exiting, there are a couple of more temples and you can plan to visit them if you’ve time.    You must try Anna Prasadam which is a food distribution service run by TTD.    All restaurants on the hill are managed by TTD and you can expect a good meal at extremely low prices."
Had a nice time. Most of the things are organised. Do eat prasadam. Had a wonderful time with family.
"I have visited Tirumala temple on 24th April 2019.From Tirupati railway station you can either go directly to the Tirumala temple by bus which costs rupees 55 or you can choose another part where you need to work for ten kilometres including 3700 steps approx, covering Seven Hills. There is one advantage of choosing the walking path is that you will get a Divya darshanam pass for visiting the temple andh is entitled for one free laddu made from Desi Ghee. Along the walking path you will find cold drink shops and other shop serving buttermilk and other regional shakes.After reaching Tirumala, you need not to worry about anything as you will get everything free of cost from food, accommodation and your hair cutting free of cost.They also have free luggage facility and also computerized. Hadn't seen this type of Management anywhere else in India.After visiting Lord Venkateswara temple you will feel really Majestic. Regional people often called lord as Govinda. There is a building having 8 to 10 halls, where in every hall having capacity of thousand people. These halls they provide you Anna prasadam, delicious food.Everyone should visit this place once in a lifetime, it is the richest temple of India."
"Always beware while travelling to the temple. Taxi, as well as auto-rickshaw Drivers, are very crooked and their only aim is to ‘loot’ you. Always bargain and fix the taxi fare prior to your travel. The temple is located on a mountain away from the Tirupati town. Taxi Drivers bargain fare from Airport to Town and to Temple differently. I recommend to take a Toyota Innova car if you have a family members of 5 or more for comfortable travel to the top of the temple. Keep the sane taxi and Driver for your come back as well. Or else you may need to bargain with another Looting Taxi or Jeep Driver after you offer prayers. Airport Taxi offers one day Taxi about 5000/-₹ per day rate. A strong suggestion for the temple visitors is always book a ‘special Darshan’ by paying 300/- ₹ per head to avoid the long hours (7 to 8 hours) queue to shorter 2 hours queue. Be fresh to stay in queue, carry enough 2 bottles of water with you to avoid dehydration. Book a taxi from your place of stay to visit the temple. Leave your foot wears, digital watches, cameras, mobile phones, etc at your hotel. These are not permitted inside the temple. Alcohol bottles, beers, cigarettes, etc are also not permitted. If anyone wish to drive your own car, please be aware of the Security check of yourselves, vehicles and baggage. If you get caught, they will ban your vehicles’ entry and ask you to take taxi or Bus to go to the Temple. Dress code for ladies is saree or decent Churidar. Men shall wear white dothi and decent shirt.May lord Balaji bless you..."
"Visit the temple twice a year. Words cannot describe the feeling one gets when inside the sanctum, despite the pull and push and constant talking by the humans in the queue. Had taken a Rs. 300 ticket. Joined the queue at 9:15am, got the darshan by 1015am. Very fast. For sarvadarshan (with tokens), it is a 5 hour wait in the queue."
"I traveled with family on 24.12.19 from Chennai. Someone from office suggested me to go for TTDC for timely Darshan. So I got 4 tickets done for four of us(including my parents)through website and it was smooth. It cost 1850*4= 7400. Only thing is no ordinary/AC tour was available. Only three Volvo bus were there.(probably they do not do ordinary trip which may decrease their revenue, fair enough) It was mentioned to reach 30 mins prior to departure that effectively comes to 4.30 am. So plan accordingly. We at 4.30 am reached at TTDC office in Anna Salai, Chennai. Our bus no was 6868.(got a SMS from ttdc just previous night with bus no and details) Bus was nice and a guide was given to every bus. Bus was having a sound system for any announcement and was in good condition.On the way to Tirupati we were given breakfast at a restaurant which was of good quality. On reaching tirupati at 9.20, we were transferred to APSRTC bus since big buses would not be allowed on the route.On the way to tirumala, security checks were done. In tirumala near to temple they have a rented flat/cottage SN303 (Sahadri Nagar 303) where clothes can be changed, washroom is also available. Phones, cameras, chappal are not allowed in main temple. So pilgrims must leave it there. Now with guide all the people of a particular bus will proceed to special darshan temple queue of temple. From then on it is auto-pilot. You follow the queue and after going through many waiting halls and more queues Lord Venketeshwara will oblige you with Darshan. We got darshan at 3.30pm.After Darshan, the guide will meet you the shop right opposite to the main temple.(below Hanumananuman temple) Will give you 2 Laddus per ticket and lunch token. Then you can go for lunch and from there return to the cottage, as they say, SN 303. Phones which were collected before leaving cottage will be given to you. After all persons of a bus return, everyone with respective guide will move towards nearby bus stand where they were earlier dropped. An APSRTC bus will be boarded and it will drop you at TTDC bus down the hill. From here we will again proceed to Chennai.Now everything looks almost perfect except time taken in Darshan. Why is rating only average?I have to admit that as per planning and process it stands for 5 rating. But there is a lot to improve on people side.Especially the guides, they have very apathetic towards pilgrims and have a attitude of high-handedness. They sees tourist as cattle.They will try to speak over you, gag you. My mom was having difficulty walking. Instead of offering any help, he kept pestering us all along- suppose you don't return time, bus will leave. He got the other guides repeating the same stuff....you should have come through booking and all... (guess what we were the first from our bus to return to cottage and guide himself came after an hour.)Other one was mockingly asked my mom if she has a bomb in the belt to support her waist...such offending remarks! My guide even asked me some money for local expenses almost in the manner as if 1850 per person does not cover it. Though he added 'whatever you like to give' afterwards.My boss earlier told that they have some understanding with staff for priority queue and quick darshan. I did not notice any such thing.We were not taken to padmavathi temple as promised.The guide even tried his best to skip a meal/evening tea and directly took us to chennai. But because of few assertive ladies(whom the guide was blaming for delay in the trip), he had to provide us the dinner at the same place where we had breakfast, again very nice.Lunch token was given for a near-by restaurant which serves very avg food. So overall, it was five star on process management but 2 star on staff and people management to TTDC.PS: Don't forget to take the *hardcopy* of aadhar card.All 3-4 buses pilgrims will use same cottage for the same time. So you might feel a bit stuff.Prepare to walk a long stretch. Reconsider if you are not well and rather aged"
visited tirupati in december had a good darshan main problem area is managing of the crowd near the main temple. Since the temple earns so much there are still lack of tourist facilities & management. There is a great problem of letting pilgrims do darshan in front of the lord they dont let you stand in peace in front of the lord imagine coming from far away spending so much money & doing darshan in nano seconds is unjust. The trust should think about this. The size of laddoo has also reduced drasiticaly inspite of increase in revenue of the trust is not justified. The management of distribution of ladoos also need to be upgraded scientificaly.
"Govinda Govinda... it is something which one gets to hear as soon as we enter the Tirumala massive premises. We went in 300rs darshan line. Its better to prebook your visit as the crowd is maddening there. Dont forget to carry your UID along for verification. No mobiles, camera etc are allowed. Dress code of dhoti shirt for males and salwar kurti/ saree for females are strictly followed. One can buy dhoti from ther if not carried along. Darshan lines are pretty hectic and one can get fatigued easily due to long queues. DO carry water bottles along as no means of purchase later. There is only one gate for entry and exit in the main temple. they manage the pushing crowd really well. One need to take careof kids and elderly well to avoid fall/ stampede. You get to have Balaji darshan only for max 10secs and before you bow u will be pulled out. So do keep your eyes wide open to look into the Garbha grah and take darshan for which all the efforts. Prasadam is wat you get post darshan on both the side of the lines- ladoo and curd rice. Have both they taste amazing. One can donate money in Srivari Hundi which u get while exiting. Please do have ladoos its unique to taste. Govinda Givinda"
