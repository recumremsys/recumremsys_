"Had a great time at the Roman baths today. Really educational and the audio commentary was great. It took about 1 hour and 10 minutes to go round, due to large numbers and Covid spacing."
An excellent day out. The commentary is very informative & interesting. Organised well to keep to Covid restrictions
"Found the Bill Bryson commentary good, kids enjoyed it. Staff helpful and worth the two hours we spent there."
Very informative & enjoyable. Good system in place during these strange times. Easy to book. Feeling like we stepped back in time briefly
"Loved the audio going round, kept the kids entertained as well. Great social distances procedures, it felt really safe"
Booked in on a Sunday morning before the queues. The audio device was really useful. Had a commentary by different people include Bill Bryson. Took about 1-5 hours if you listen to all the audio too.  You don't get a chance to take a dip which is a shame.
Good value. Felt safe re virus precautions. Got the audio machine at the start which made it more interesting with clear audio.
"A lovely historical place to visit and re-visit.  A must go spot in Bath!Spent around 2 hours+ to walk around as it was my friend’s visit, she enjoyed the time there as well! Don’t miss the gift shop as there are some lovely stuff to buy such as hand cream / lotion and the tote bags."
Amazing place. Was well organised and the route worked well. Audio guides superb- allowed you to listen to as much as you liked. Definitely a must visit.
Fabulous experience. Well the entry fee. Have coped with Arrangement to ‘Allow for self distancing and hygiene.Amazing to think of people using the baths 2000 years ago.
Went with 2 young children the audio guide for kids is great and kept my 5yr old interested the whole way round. everything was so well set up and loads of staff on hand to ensure social distancing was observed and you knew where to go so impressed with all they've done really don't think they could have done more. Also really refreshing to find a gift shop with nice small things for kids to buy that are also pocket money prices it meant both kids and parents left smiling!
Spent the day sightseeing Bath.Really enjoyed the tour of the Roman Baths. Covid-19 information was published around the venue.Provided with a recorder that gave a commentary as we walked round putting in area number which then commented on that period in history.
Had an interesting day at the Roman baths . Pre booked tickets and arrived and was directed to collect tickets. Amazing building . We’re given a hand held device for information. Very informative and felt safe with the controls put in place . A unique experience.
"First visit to Bath and thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Roman Baths. Pre booking tickets required. Very interesting, good audio guide. Staff helpful. Lots to see well worth a visit."
Visited today. Really set up well under the circumstances. Audio system for commentary on the way around giving great information and detail and Route well laid out to ensure everyone keeps their distance and are safe. Didn’t feel rushed at all. Well done.
"Visited during a wet Tuesday afternoon. Booked tickets online. Tour good & interesting. Definitely worth a visit. While staff where observing felt safe with social distancing measures, however when they wasn’t felt uneasy at people getting too close! Less than 1 metre at times. Overall would recommend but suggest more staffing if possible as not all visitors observed social distancing."
"Visited the Baths with my husband recently. All safety measures for covid where in place.. well organised... a visit to the baths is a must ,very interesting and informative.staff were very knowledgeable"
"Visited here for what I thought would be a 20/30 minute tour.  Actually it takes about 90mins and so offers excellent value for money.  Intriguing insight into the Roman baths, their beliefs and the hot spring.  Plenty of photo opportunities and we found the whole place fascinating and much bigger than we expected"
It was something you have to do because your in Bath . Found it slightly boring at times . Not keen on the tour elements but because of COVID you have to adhere to it.  Found the atmosphere inside humid with having to wear a mask.
"My husband and I booked the baths and thought we’d be there maybe an hour. Ended up spending over 2! Great attraction, so much more to it that you’d think. It’s beautifully clean and well presented and I must say well organised through these strange times. A must see when in Bath"
"We had a great tour of the Roman Baths. We were booked in for the 10:00 tour (you can only book online at the moment so need tickets when you arrive). Entry was well organised with all Covid 19 requirements in place. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. We took our own headphones for the audio tour, which was easy to use and very informative. Being on an early booking we didn't have many people around us so had space and time to enjoy the tour and take in the history.Overall the tour was well organised, informative and enjoyable - a must do in Bath."
"We booked tickets and time slot online which was very easy to do. Took us about 1 hour and 20 minutes to go round.  Very informative not boring.  Would recommend,"
Loved our visit here. Can’t come to Bath and not see the baths. Learnt lots and walked the path of Pilgrims. Felt very special to see such history! A must see.
"Visited with my daughter. We had a lovely wander around, listening to the audio chat as we went. It was limited entry so was ideal for us to be able to see everything.Very enjoyable."
Great visit. Very interesting. Had a phone you walk around with and you select information to hear.Lots of waiting however this is what has to happen with Covid.A must see in Bath.
"The whole place is extremely interesting. The covid measures are good, with full ppe for staff and letting minimum people into the building at a time. Unfortunately some areas in the building are closed off, I'm guessing as they're too small for 2m distance but what was open was good. I do think the experience was a bit expensive, over £40. However, its good to support the place after lockdown so not too irritated. I would love if they could explain how the roof was actually made and put up there? was it a pully system? Very interesting"
"Wasn’t sure what to expect but wasn’t disappointed. Found it really interesting, the audio information was great."
"Visted on a Saturday afternoon. Whilst it was intestering and informative to visit, we felt that the experience was let down by COVID measures. Each 15 minute ticket sime slot allows 40-50 people per time, which results in lots of queueing throughout the exhibit. We were there for just over an hour, and probably spent 15-20 minutes of that queueing, so it didn't feel like good value for money."
Prebooking essential ( but I think that’s the norm now) The tour was slow paced but again I think this was due to social distancing but it did encourage my 3 teenage children to interact with the audio devices & listen to the stories. The coin collection was our highlight even though it was a small display. Some areas are chained off but didn’t really impact on the visit. Staff were helpful and friendly & it was a welcome 2hour break from the sun. Amazing to think you were walking & touching things that have survived centuries.
"So informative, absolutely fascinating. Do not visit Bath without going here you will love it.  You learn so much and it is not a rushed visit well worth the money."
"Amazing informative visit to the Roman Baths . Liked the visual interpretations of what life was like back then .The Romans were so clever and ahead of their time regarding inventions. Plenty of modern day provisions like sanitiser ,social distancing etc."
"Usual Covid-19 disclaimer. Pre book. We went Wednesday morning and there were no slots left until Friday. 2m strictly enforced. Masks could be taken off in any outdoor area though.Having said all that, it was still a thoroughly enjoyable experience. You are provided with a handset which has pre recorded narratives. There are the normal type, some for children and additional bonus content from Bill Bryson. All are informative and about 90 seconds each. There were some rooms that had been blocked off because of social distancing considerations, but you could still look in and hear the commentary.At the main bath area,  were two reenactors dressed as Roman and Celtic ladies. They invited you to partake of the waters once you had prepared beforehand - spoiler alert - it doesn’t happen!We had time to chat to a couple of the guides dotted around the museum and they were very knowledgeable about the exhibits too.All in all, an excellent visit despite the necessary constraints at the moment. In fact being able to amble around in the absence of massive crowds could be seen as a positive."
We visited the baths last week on a pre booked ticket. The hand held devices were very informative with explanations of different parts of the baths all through the tour. Covid measures were very well enforced. Staff were at various points stopping people and letting them proceed with safety.  It was very well organised  and because they are restricting numbers too it was a much nicer experience and not a free for all. An enjoyable visit. Thank you
"Was really looking forward to this but what letThe experience down was that despite the timed entry slots, where we already waited 15mins, we then had to queue on the terrace for  another 45 minutes, on a shadeless hot afternoon. The total wait of one hour made us weary and took most of the joy out of the afternoon. The tour was very good, and the audio informative. I get its a difficult act to balance the number of people with the desire to generate revenues again, but for us, it just didn’t work. We did overhear a member of staff saying it was particularly busy. Just hope others dont have to queue as long as we did,As I am sure this would otherwise be very good."
Worth going to see.  It is very informative.  Go to Sally Lunns for a bun afterwards.  It is the oldest house in Bath!
