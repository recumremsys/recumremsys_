Truly a great experience seeing the iconic tower bridge . Historic and iconic building . Is a must see when in london
Such a heritage of the world. Amazed by its architecture and location. The London tower bridge is a must do when traveling to London.
First time in London and first place to visit was the Tower Bridge. Very beautiful and interesting. Visiting it is a must.
"Visiting this bridge very often, it is one of the most beautiful building in London.We absollove it with my husband. You can go inside as well, it is cheap can look around within an hour or so, I think it worth the visit.I have taken hundreds of pictures of it, if I am there I just have to take a picture. It is beautiful especially in a sunny day."
One of my favourtie experiences in London. The view is amazing. Very informative tour. Sitting on the glass was terrifying and cool at the same time!
Loved walking over it with the family. Just a mesmerising sight in London and a must to do. Next time may do the tour
A nice trip to this place. Was close to Tower of London and the HMS Belfast warship; we covered all three together after lunch. We had the London pass and hence did not have to wait in a long queue. The overall experience was good with nice afternoon sunshine. It was not very crowded inside the bridge and hence lot of time to click pictures. The demo of how the bridge works covered in a separate place was informative.
"Always a lovely experience to take friends from abroad too. It's nice to cross the bridge, we didn't see any ships this time to see it open but once you cross over going to visit the tower of London. Is awsome"
"Walking thorugh Tower Bridge is a great experience, ableto see the inner workings of the bridge is good. A must see for anyone visiting London"
"This bridge crosses the River Thames and this impressive piece of architecture i have seen in London. Recommended use ferry and cable car which is great experience,Down the road their are some nice restaurant to enjoy various cuisine."
After my father received Freedom of the City of London in 1979 we decided to visit Tower Bridge and its workings including the below ground balance. I have just visited the 2020 Tower Bridge Exhibition and what an excellent experience and amazing customer team. You will enjoy two glass walkways and lots of sliding glass windows allow you to take perfect pictures whatever the weather. If you don’t want to use stairs there are two lifts to get easily up or down.Many of the screens had alternative languages and I saw tourists using them.The team work hard to deliver excellent customer service and are very proud of their jobs. Pay a visit to the souvenir shop and you won’t be disappointed
Was fantastic to walk over the top of tower bridge we’re there is a glass path to walk over to look down upon the rest of the bridge and river. A must do !!!
"It is the most remarkable and the most beautiful bridge in London. Go and see it and then walk down to the Millenium bridge, the view of people passing by will show you the speed of life in London."
We spent over an hour here and with the London Pass got fast access to ticketing.  Loved the engine room and walking along the top of the bridge where you can see the traffic below - can be a bit daunting for those scared of heights.  Quite a lot of detail if you look for it on the bridge itself.
"A truly great experience for only £10. Now is the time to visit London, all covid safe and no queues. Done the tour of Tower Bridge only 6 people on it, walked the glass floor was lucky enough to be there when the bridge opened and filmed a Tall ship passing underneath the glass floor, watched it close and the cyclists race across, brilliant. Howard was a great tour guide very informative and humorous."
"Walked across this iconic bridge, then the next day went under it on a Thames river boat. It is a wonderful piece of Victorian engineering, sadly I never witnessed it opening . Walked across from City of London side to walk along River towards London Bridge, stopped off at 'The Draft House' pub for good food and real ale."
"I mean, yes it is just a bridge, a cool one.  The architecture is interesting and ornate. Watching larger boats go under it where it raises and lowers its platform."
"This is another stop on the Hop on Hop off Bus.  Amazing architecture, history, and views.  A lot of stair climbing and walking is involved, so those with mobility concerns should take that into consideration before attempting this attraction.  The hosts are friendly and knowledgeable.  Check for discounts.  Combine to see the Tower monument for a reduced price.  We chose that option.  You can see the former engines that raised/lowered the bridge in bygone days.  Have fun lying on the glass walkway over the road beneath and taking a picture in the mirror overhead. Points of information are found along the way, along with a suggested route to follow.  This event is self-guided.  There is a gift shop, and toilets.  There are views, too, such as of the Monument tower, HMS Belfast, and the Thames.  Fascinating and interesting architecture.  Fun!  Wear comfortable shoes.  It was very windy when we went.  Gusts prevented small children from moving forward."
"Was crossing the bridge when I thought there is a museum on here somewhere which always looked busy, but at present so quiet we took the opportunity and went in. Well worth the visit especially the glass floor and don’t forget to look up for that extra thrill. Great bit of history for London and the restoration of the boilers and and pistons looked amazing. Well worth the time and hold work up the steps, but there is a lift available if needed."
Great place to visit and excellent value for money.  I booked tickets via my hotel  and paid £8 more than on the door. Don't make the same mistake. Buying tickets in advance does not get you in any quicker and costs more.
"Saw this bridge in a music video that inspired me to come to London. I was not disappointed! It was a short 15 minute walk from our hotel at the Doubletree by Hilton. You enter the bridge underneath through stairs, free of charge. Bridge is not long, prolly about a 20 min walk. Very windy so grab a coat, and its very busy with cars and tourist. At times the bridge will open up for ships to pass, there are gates and guards that patrol the bridge when that happens, very safe. On the corners of the bridge are people with stands selling caramelized peanuts for 2 pounds. They were hot & delicious. We walked the bridge everyday, my favorite times were in the early morning and at night on our way back from touring.There is a walkway near the bridge along the river, where you can take some amazing shots in the daytime with the bridge in the background. No people hassling you for anything here unlike the other tourist spots. This was definitely one of my highlights visiting London."
Visited before London went on lockdown and had it almost to ourselves. Amazing guide I think his name was Barney. Found the whole experience so interesting and went straight through to see the Crown Jewels. Cafe on site for drink and sandwich. Would definitely recommend and good value.
Even more beautiful in person. Had a lovely blue color and quite windy with the vehicles driving through quickly. I went during the weekday so wasn't crowded at all and got some great shots.
Got a discount on. The door because I live here in London. Worth a visit. Like the glass floor. Some great views
"This bridge is a must visit! It’s beautiful to look at and even better to go inside. We didn’t see it lifting but the craftsmanship and her beauty of the building is just breathtaking! Go inside, it’s reasonable. Take some pics on the glass floor. Really enjoyed it. The whole surrounding area has a fab vibe."
It's the symbol and you cannot miss this! view from Tower of London shore side is amazing! stroll along the river to admire the iconic view!
"What an icon of London. Such over the top Victorian masterpiece. Be sure to pay to go inside and see how it all works, its worth every penny."
"Very interesting, lots to see and learn. Haven't taken the childryen yet but will do. Some of the ques are quite long, but I guess that's to be expected."
"Iconic pictures, Instagram worthy. Go the southern side of Thames for great pictures. Also try the walk on south bank"
"I have visited London many times and passed under the bridge on a boat, this time I decided to go over the bridge. I took the stairs to the top, which although tiring was worth it. The walk across the glass floor was great, looking down to the road and river below. Continued from the bridge into the Engine room which was also interesting and it was good to see that the old machinery has been well looked after.Read a lot of interesting facts while on the visit"
"This is (I think) one of London's most beautiful bridges, and with our Travelcards, we were able to get two for one tickets to climb up the North Tower and walk across the upper level walkway. It is enclosed, so weather is not an issue, and there are small windows that open that allow you to get amazing pictures up and down the river. We went at night, so the city was lit up; it was beautiful. There is also part of the floor that is glass, so you can see the road and the river underneath you. We also went just down the road a bit to see the Engine Room and learn more about the history of the bridge and the people who worked it every day. It was fascinating and well worth the extra time. Walking back across the lower level of the bridge (street level) rounded out the visit nicely. This was a very cool stop."
"Whether you’re into your architecture, engineering or London’s history I would recommend visiting Tower Bridge. Learn about London’s magnificent bridge and what it took to build it and keep it running. Also how it’s been modernised for 21st century working."
"We were staying near Victoria and caught a local bus to here, on getting onto the bridge we saw you could go up to the top and as it was quiet you didn't need to book, it was a great workout for the legs getting to the top and once there you could either walk across the glass panel or round it. Was good to maybe pass an hout"
Took a tour of the bridge.  The views from the top of the bridge were great and the glass walkway provided some excellent photos.  Would have liked to have learned more about the history surrounding the bridge
Obviously this is incredibly iconic which makes it worth checking out aside from any other Merit. It is a beautiful structure. Entering it and going across the structure at the top is worth it. The see-through glass floors are pretty cool and the view at Sunset over the river is unbeatable.
