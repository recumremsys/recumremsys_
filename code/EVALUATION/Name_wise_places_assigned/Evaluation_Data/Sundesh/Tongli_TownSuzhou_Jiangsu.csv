"Took the metro train here and then took a 10 min ride on a  tricycle bike to Tongli from the station. The driver just dropped us near the town and not at the entrance and we had to walk and asked for directions to reach the entrance. Actually, there was a cheap bus service from the station to Tongli which we took when we had to return to the station.  You had to pay an entrance fee to enter this town, more like a village. Not so cheap. Crowded with tourists. Very commercial old town and not so authentic. We had the feeling it was all geared for the tourist. Found a better old water town in Shanghai which was more laid back and entrance was free."
"Take the bus for 8 RMB from the upper level of the long distance bus station by Suzhou railway station. Journey is 1 hour and part goes beside Grand Canal. At Tongli go to Tourism Office beside the bus station to buy entry ticket for Old Town for 100 RMB (50 for over 65s) and 5 RMB ticket for electric car.  Old Town ticket includes entry to all the main places and a boat trip to island.  We didn't have time to do everything on a wet day in March. See other reviews for their opinions but highlight for us was Pearl Tower which is a lovely garden complex, comparable to those in Suzhou itself. Suggest you check return bus times when you arrive and maybe buy your return ticket then to ensure a seat. Last bus on our day was1940 but we took 1710 and journey took about 90 mins due to traffic."
"Visited Tongli two weeks ago from Suzhou. Take metro line 4 to the Tongli Station (terminal station). Follow the crowd through the exit. At the back of the station, take bus 725 (you will not miss it as you'll see a long line or a large crowd). The 4th stop is the Tongli scenic area. Bus ticket was 1CNY, but will be 2CNY if AC is on. Get off the bus and walk back a little, then cross the street at the traffic signal, you will see the ticket office (near KFC).  The entrance fee is 100CNY.Lots of shops and restaurants line the street to the old town.  Use an online map for general direction.  The old town is in a very sad condition - cafes and restaurants along the canals look dirty and unappetizing, mold ubiquitous on white-washed walls, dusty rooms in the gardens and halls, faded painting, rotten wood and beams on ancient structures...  If no maintenance or restoration is done soon, the old town will no longer be able to attract tourists in a few decades.  Tongli should seriously consider investing quickly and heavily in renovating the main attractions to make them truly charming and presentable.  If you've been to the Cotswolds in England, you know that old doesn't have to be dilapidated or dirty or unkempt.I loved the Pearl Tower (the rear garden was delightful) and Tuisi Garden.  And I look forward to seeing them again in the future in a much better condition."
Took a bus from Suzhou to Tongli.  Wasnt able to figure out the small commuter tram to the town so I walked.  Great place to visit.  Took the water boat tour (was great and relaxing).  Lots of photo moments to share. I wish I had more time but the bus left Tongli at 3 to return to Suzhou.
"Reaching this place was an adventure in itself, taking a train from Suzhou, an hour bus ride to Tongli and an electric cart to the city. Great place to walk around and explore. Not as crowded as you would expect. Tons of food options, I recommend you find a spot facing the canals and watch all the gondolas (?) go by. Check out a restaurant simply called ""Coffee"".. Very friendly, cleanest bathroom in possibly all of China and an awesome view. The garden was not very impressive when compared to the bigger ones in Suzhou."
"Thanks to reviewers here so we took subway Line 4 to Tongli Station, followed the sign ""to Tongli Ancient Town"" to walk to an exit, saw a counter inside subway station selling ticket for 80 or 88RMB (ticket showed 100RMB) including round trip bus. The lady was so nice. She asked if I wanted to go immediately. I said yes so she called the walkie talkie, quickly walked with us outside the station, made an effort to locate the bus for us. Thank you so much. So we got on the new, clean, air-con (very cool) bus and arrived at Tongli.The place was peaceful for a leisure walk. Heard local people sang a song at restaurant tables and people could tip her if they wish to. We also ate there and price was not expensive compared with eating downtown Suzhou. They had menu with price listed clearly and they were happy to talk to us.In some gates, they had signage saying if walking through it, ticket was considered used and if we wanted to go back inside, we had to buy new ticket. So we knew and continued to walk inside.As it was so hot, we decided to end our visit sooner than planned, found our way back to where the bus stopped. Remember to take the photo of the bus so you can locate your bus. It came every 30 minutes."
Took a couple of hours to get there by rapid train and bus via Suzhou and the same back to Shanghai. Well worth the visit. For me this was a China highlight. I would definitely recommend a visit.
"Travelled by train to Suzhou, met our guide, looked around the old town and were then driven to Tongli. Lovely water town, far better than Suzhou. Wander along the streets and take a boat on the waterway. For a few yuan the boatman will sing chinese folk songs for you.One thing that I did like was lovely artist there. Go over the stone bridge at the entrance to Tongli. Travel about 50 metres and then you will need to turn right. On your left is a little shop where there is a man selling art work. Some monochrome and some in colour. He is a charming man. I wished we had had more time to spend there. We bought a picture about one metre by 50cm for about £10. For another £5 we could have had the frame but I did not see how I could get it on the plane. At the end on that street on the right was a tea shop."
"One of the many water towns near Suzhou. We took a bus from Suzhou North Train station. About 1.5 hour. Day trip (2-3 hours). Town is small. Commercialized but still quiet (we visited in Dec) enough to walk around and enjoy. White buildings, black roofs, bridges over canals that criss-cross the small town. You can take a cruise on a small boat. Interesting local tradition of walking the three bridges during festive occasions.Note: from the bus stop, it is still a considerable walking distance (about 30 min) to the water town. Saw some bus ferries on our way back."
"Visited both Suzhou and Tongli town. As a solo traveler, I took a morning high speed train from shanghai and had previously booked Jeff to drive me around. jeff picked me up at the Suzhou station and then we visiting Tongli town, Humble Administrators Garden, Pingjiang Street and Tiger Hill. We enjoyed a white milk tea (see picture) that was simply refreshing and delicious. Jeff is a local to Suzhou, knows English and took care of me as if I was his friend from long before. jeff can be reached at: wechat: 18626211664, or via email at 309834760@qq.com. I highly recommend Suzhou and Tongli town.  Great trip overall."
"Actually visited in January 2016. We took the train from Shanghai to Suzhou, then the bus from Suzhou to this little water town. Had been reading reviews at the time that it was smaller and less crowded than the other water towns. No regrets at all that we chose it, the highlight of our trip.The water town was small but really pretty and picturesque. We went there without any prior arrangements, and managed to stay at a nice and simple local-run boutique hotel for a fair price. You can also stay just outside the town itself, there are a few shop houses along the way which had rooms for rent.Not sure whether it was due to low season, but it wasn't crowded, and that was perfect. We wandered around the old streets, crossing bridges, visiting gardens, temples, and also exploring the small and interesting shops. Some craft were worth investing in.Souvenirs seemed much cheaper here than at the big cities too. Some shops made homemade ricewine using the traditional method. They usually allow you to taste and you can purchase some if you like it.Really enjoyed our 1 night stay there, but didn't manage to explore every shop. I think if you like a slow and laid back escape from the hustle and bustle of the nearby cities, you can even stay for 2 nights or more.Personally, compared to say the Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou, I very much prefer spending a night or two in one of the old water towns such as Tongli."
"Approx. 1h subway ride & another 10-15m by public bus (no need to take the private one, no added value in it). Entrance ticket is 100Rmb (if bought at spot, next to KFC) or around 80 if you’ll buy online. Decent place which was not too much overcrowded even during public holidays (Dragon boat festival). Take left turn immediately after the ticket check & once you cross the first bridge - to circle the place completely. Place itself is a typical old town with all houses changed into the restaurants & shopping places - but still keeps a bit of atmosphere. If you haven’t visited other water towns - this is a good choice. Count with approx. 3-4h in the place + travel."
"We took the 6:47 G trains from Shanghai, it took 33minutes to reach Suzhuobhei station. We had breakfast at Starbucks. Was reading prior departure to take the bus to Tongli but since we couldn’t locate the bus though there was a bus station, went there to ask where’s the bus bound for Tongli but we were told to take the Metro. Ask the police patrolling, said the same, take the metro. We took the metro and it took around 40 minutes to reach Tongli, very cheap. In fairness the train, station, surrounding was clean. When we reached Tongli station, we walked to the nearby bus station and took the bus to Tongli Town, as there were obviously tourists like us, we knew we didn’t got lost. About 3 rounds, we saw the sign “ ancient village”, and the bus driver said something in chinese that we kinda understood we reached our destination. It’s very easy to move around this town, just look up for the signs. The locals were very nice."
"Went with my friend as part of our China trip, we were staying in Suzhou so took the new metro line (4 I think it was - the dark blue one) all the way to the last stop which is tongli, cost us 7 rmb each. Think we were on the metro about an hour in total (including getting from our hotel area on the red line).When you come out of the metro station there are bus stops just behind. I took the information I found on here and we got on the 725 bus. This is now 2 rmb, but takes you to the town area. It's final stop is the bus station next to the east parking lot, but we jumped off a little before, on the main road. If you see the KFC and the large Chinese gates, get off. Much more pleasant way to walk upon entry to the old town area.Paid the 100 rmb entry fee and in we went. It was a nice little place, and we enjoyed walking along the streets adjacent to the water and over the bridges. We didn't do all the places you could get into on the ticket. We decided as a final stop to go and do the ferry over to the island. After walking out of the town and up a long street (which in over 40 degree heat felt like it went on forever) we finally arrived at the ferry terminal. As we entered there was no staff member which greeted you or told you what to do, there were about 7 other people sat down waiting so we sat down too. A ferry returned from the island and people got off, the staff member disappeared back into the office, and no loading of the ferry happened. The other people eventually just walked off. We waited around 30 mins, which should've been plenty of time even with them potentially only doing trips every 30 mins (what with unloading and loading etc), but there was no acknowledgment from anyone, and some staff were even laid out on the chairs sleeping.We were a little disappointed with this ending to our visit.We then walked the short distance to the bus station and got the 725 bus back to the metro line. Personally we'd say to visit if you had time in your schedule, but not somewhere we'd plan to visit again."
"Went to Tongli on the metro and bus from Suzhou and Im so glad I made the trek.  Real old China, preserved in a great way.  Tourism traps with boats etc then same time a woman doing her washing in the canal.  Really felt emotional pull here although the map/directions once you buy the ticket are a bit of a mystery.  Train/bus is a pain tho. Walked back to train from Tongli but took a good hour in high heat!"
"Tongli is a very nice water town around Shanghai (about 1h30 by car). The ticket includes all the entries of the park and mansions in the city. Don't forget to take the boat on the lake wich will bring you to a nice temple on the island,Note the Sex museum has been transfered to an other city. You can find a lot of local restaurant, meaning if you are a bit sensitive, I suggest you take a lunch pack."
"Tongli is a cute water town that can be visited as a half day trip from Shanghai. There are several ways to get here from Shanghai - bus, train and metro, or as part of a tour group. We went by ourselves and caught a fast train out from the main Shanghai train station to Suzou. From Suzou train station we caught the metro for about 24 stops (!) to Tongli. At the Tongli metro station we purchased our water town tickets from the tourist service centre (RMB88 - this is cheaper than buying at the water town entrance) which included a free tourist bus (a 10 minute journey) to the water town carpark. It was a 5 minute walk from the car park to the old town's north entrance at Yongan Bridge. Considering we started our day with a metro ride to the train station in Shanghai, it's quite a journey to reach Tongli and we spent about 3 hours getting there!On the way back we caught an express bus from Tongli bus station (a 20 minute walk from the water town) to the main Shanghai bus station. This was cheaper and faster, taking around 2 hours through stop-start traffic in Shanghai.  Entrance to the old town requires a ticket (RMB100 if bought at the entrance) which covers entrance to eight buildings and gardens. If you're visiting in August it's very hot so either pace yourself to cover these sites or pick a few of them. We visited Gengle Hall, Pearl Tower, Taihu Water Conservancy Pavilion, Chongben Hall and Tuisi Garden. Pearl Tower and Gengle Hall were my favourites, and Tuisi Gardens were also nice.  The tree-lined canals were beautiful. There is an impressive number of clean, well maintained toilets throughout the town and lots of restaurants and stores."
We did this trip ourselves .. Came by metro from Suzhou ... Stay on metro till last stop in Tongli and take a shuttle bus to the old town...( about 15mins ) The tourist information desk in the metro station sold me a ticket but told me to buy my husbands ticket at the town entrance ( he has just turned 60) as it would be half price...good advice!! really enjoyed wandering about the canals and small streets and the entrance ticket lets you go into lots of lovely and interesting gardens and buildings.. However the map we were given was a bit confusing and we ended up exiting in the opposite direction from where we went in ....could have been a disaster as we speak no Chinese.. We didn't manage to find the shuttle bus back but we  did eventually locate the local bus station and for 1 yuan each got back to the metro station.. All ended well! Well worth the effort.. A great place to visit...much quieter and for us more rewarding than the Humble Administrators Garden in Suzhou.
"While a little touristy, Tongli is easily accessible from Suzhou using the metro. Ignore the tat and people offering to take you on a tour of the town on their bikes. Head out on foot and enjoy exploring. Just be careful not to eat at the restaurants that wash their dishes in the river. It isn't clean. We ate at a lovely vegetarian restaurant near Gengle Hall. The interior is awe inspiring and the noodles were delicious. Tongli has plenty to look at and is a good way to while away half a day."
"Getting there from Suzhou is quite easy because of the subway system; there will be four lines although line 3 is still not operational at time of writing. Probably the most useful is line 4 which runs through Gusu (old Suzhou) from the railway station in the North to Panmen in the South, and beyond. Take line 4 southwards to Tongli, the terminal station. Cost is 6 RMB. Take exit 2, following the signs (albeit in Chinese) to the bus to the Tongli old town. Anyway, up the escalator of exit 2 go along the sheltered corridor for about 20 m to the bus stop for bus #725; the place looks like a car park. The fare (no change is given) is 1 RMB, and it is about 4 stops to the old town. Frequency is 5-15 min. Entrance to the old town is across the road, at the junction just before the bus stop (right turn in heading towards the junction). Entrance fee is 100 RMB.The old town is now very commercialised and totally unlike what it was like in our last visit more than a decade back. Still, it makes a decent walk, especially the Tuisi garden. With a 1000 years' history, i guess one must at least visit it. There is also a stage at the central square where opera performances are given at specific times."
"I went to Suzhou and Tongli on a one day trip booked with China Highligths. Booking online was very easy, and everything organized upon request. My guide was Sophie Lee, speaking very good english, professional and with good knowledge about those places.Humble Administrator Garden is definitly a place to visit for all those appreciating nature and garden architecture. It’s classified by UNESCO, and well preserved.Tongli is a very interesting water village, less commercial and crowded then other water villages near to Shanghai.And lunch organized by Sophie in a local restaurant (YangYang) was quite pleasant, need to try crab soup!All in all an excellent day! Thank you Sophie!"
This is not the best water village in this area but easy to access from Suzhou. Can make a boat tour (30mn and 90 Rmb whatever number of persons). Dining alongside the canal in evening is nice.
"It takes about 2 hours drive from Shanghai over without traffic. What is different in this old town, one must see its: One Garden(退思园), Two old houses(嘉荫堂,崇本堂), and three bridges(太平桥、吉利桥和长庆桥). Like the other 5 preserved old town, there is a man made river running through the old town. Along the river, there are many places one can just sit down and order food.  It is the ideal place to rest and have a lunch of the local delicacy. Buy the ticket from the entrance building and do not confused by the local pretended not licensed tour guide.  Visit the garden 1st, then walk along the river to visit other attractions or follow the recommended route from the front door."
Take a boat ride down the ancient canals to see the real old China.  This beautiful village is very crowded and be alert to motorcycles that share the walkways.
"Took a taxi from hotel which cost 75RMB from Suzhou. Very pretty even in the rain. Lots to see and the photo shops with costumes are a must! Boat ride was another way to see the town, which cost 90RMB for the boat. You can share the boat with others (6ppl max). Lots of cool little shops and food stalls. We got lost a few times, but that's the fun part."
"Made a mistake and booked hotel car for 4 hours at rmb1,000 !!! There are taxis available even though it seems remote and about 1 hour drive from the city.  Arrived early at 11am and most shops have just opened. Wondered around and had some fun wearing traditional costumes featured in popular TV drama series.  It is only 10rmb but costume.  Lunch at a restaurant popular for bucket rice. Not bad actually. Finally found a spot where I could fly my drone. Didnt take boat ride. The whole town has lost her ancient feel due to too many modern retailers even though the buildings seem old.   Nonetheless, I enjoyed the short trip there."
"You can easily spend 3-4 hours walking around Tongli Town.  A totally different experience that makes you feel like you're in another time in the past.Take your time to just walk around and take pictures and enjoy the sights.  Have a meal or a drink (tea or otherwise).  Lots of places to eat, snack, drink or shop.The water surrounding it is not just a moat, its actually (I believe) connected canals.Easy to get to.  We took the Metro (I believe Line 4)  from Suzhou.  Tongli is the last stop.  Then exit and take a shuttle, bus or taxi (all with signs).  Bring you passport/ID.  If you're over 60, you can get in for 1/2 price."
"TongLi old town is a nice day trip destination from Suzhou albeit it's getting touristy. Go early to have a peaceful and leisurely stroll around the water town or stay overnight in one of the inn or hotel to enjoy the night views without the crowd. Good photography spots when you go early before the crowds stream in. Enjoy a home cooked style meal at one of the many small eateries by the river taking in the serenity and watching the water boat go by... Worth a visit before it gets too commercialized.For those trying to get there by public transport from Suzhou city, take the Metro line 4 to TongLi station, leave via Exit 2 and walk to the bus stand for service 725. Alight at Shi Pai Lou stop and follow the signage into the old town."
"Aprx one hour of driving to Tong-Li.It is really a small town similar image of Venice but very Chinese way town. First image was a smellie old Chinese Town. But when I ride a woman rowing boat and follow along the narrow water road, the scenic of peaceful town touch my heart. People actually living in the town sharing one bathroom with several families without change for a long long period. I do not recommend eating there, however sitting in cafe and enjoying the peace of few moment with espresso is not bad idea.I wnet there with private tour so I cannot give detailed price how much they charge for the boat ride but make sure have that boat ride chance.it was a memorable moment."
"Not yet a tourist Mecca, Tongli is a place you can go to visit and see traditional Chinese people working and living in a modest city setting, yet close to a large city. Home to just over 2000 people, the old 'Venice of the Orient' is a place of friendly people and artisans. It's about a 45 minute ride from Shanghai, but well worth the trip. Get tickets for the water taxi, and then wander around afterward to enjoy the day."
Take a boat ride through the canals and see the scenery and the old tradiotional chinese houses. Very nice and relaxing
Visited Tongli in the low season and glad I was able to walk around without being afraid of being pushed into the waters.The waters here are much cleaner than the one I saw in Wuzhen but that was more lively. Perhaps due to the low season.Tongli is great with many different and artistic alleys for photos; or even just a leisure walk around.Many restaurants place their dining tables along the banks and some are really territorial - you can’t stand there to take pictures without paying to sit there. So just cautious. It’s a good relaxing feeling to sit and have your meals by the banks too.
"With the opening of Line 4 on the Suzhou Metro, this is now a fairly easy attraction to get to from Suzhou. Take line 4 all the way to Tongli, exit 2, and you can pay to get a bus into the ancient town. The 90 RMB bus fare covers the town's entry fee (normally 100 RMB, I believe) and gets you into several of the museums in the town. The town is very touristy, similar to Hoi An in Vietnam, but pleasant, nonetheless. I recommend going in the morning to beat the crowds. By early afternoon, the town was packed with people."
"We were only in  Suzhou  a few days so we ended up having to choose between Tongli and the Grand Canal in Suzhou. After much deliberation and reading we chose to take a short day trip to Tongli. It was about a 45 minute drive (18 kilometers or so)  from our hotel in ancient town Suzhou give or take.  Granted it is not as grand and spectacular as Venice, but it is still a good option and sort of a poor man's Venice, so to speak, to use a poor analogy. This is understandable, as it doesn't have the massive Imperial history that Venice has. Venice was a country and Empire of a grand scale with great wealth, so they could make the city look spectacular.  But Tongli is a picturesque Chinese canal town.  I was and I am glad we chose to go to Tongli. I guess we picked a good day, as it did not seem that crowded. We were able to walk around unobstructed by large crowds, and enjoy observing local people living their daily lives on the canals. We stopped in a nice little coffee shop right on one of the canals and had a nice refreshment and visit with our guide. (We hired a guide to drive us there for about 600 RMB). I took lots of pictures but I have to admit of the three major historical bridges I don't know which is which even after doing research on the Internet. But regardless, they are still interesting and picturesque. Historical and architectural features are as follows: well preserved town with 1000 year history, 49 stone bridges (Tongli is called a town of bridges), built on 7 islands intersected by 15 canals,  arched roofs, lofty gables, stone bridges and green willows lining the banks, steps to the canals for the locals to wash their clothes, and pans, as well as get on boats easily. Three most notable bridges are Taiping (Peace and Tranquility) Bridge, Jili (Luck) Bridge and Changqing (Lasting Celebration) Bridge, collectively known as Ternate Bridges and are fortunate symbols in the eyes of the local residents and they walk over them for good luck during weddings or birthday parties.The oldest bridge in Tongli is Siben (Reflecting Origin) Bridge, which was built in the Song Dynasty (960-1279).For a detailed description and my major source of information, please see http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/97638.htm"
"Tongli Gu Zhen is a scenic and nice place to hang out. We stayed the night in one of the old buildings which is modified to become an inn. The host are pleasant. me and wife had a night stroll and it's safe. Our travel date is 4th-5th Jan and its winter time. Some of the lighting may not be fully turned on as the locals call it the ""low peak"" period. However the main light attractions at night are still very delightful to watch. woke up in the 2nd morning and the breakfast shops are awesome. There are variety of food to choose from even for lunch. The buildings are nicely designed. Definitely worth the time there!"
