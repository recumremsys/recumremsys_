"When we visited here we were amazed!! Walking around made us feel like children again as it is so magical! Me and my boyfriend came here in the summer and cannot wait to go again. Before we came we weren't Harry Potter fans in the slightest but since coming here it made us obsessed!! If you are a harry potter fan you MUST go and even if youre not, it will convert you!! Brilliant for families and couples."
"Always love going to Hog Mead and Hogs Mead awesome.  Ride the train.  Do both areas.  The restaurant that serves chicken, roasted corn and baby potatoes is good food for a reasonable price."
"Visited this attraction mainly cause wife and daughters are fans of Harry Potter. Iâ€™m the one who hardly knows names, locations, characters, etc. Anyway, we allhad a great time visiting this part of Universal Studios. Atmosphere, architecture and details are perfectly recreated. I honestly enjoyed it although didnâ€™t bought a magic wand for usd60 (interactive ones were about usd 100). Highly recommended."
"Visited for second time on annual pass, loved it. Hagrids ride is amazing, fast, exciting, we did it 3x in one day! Queueing system quite good, so you never see the whole queue, or you might be put off.The whole WWHP is fabulous,  still love the original HP ride, well designed. We also loved Diagon alley, well worth a visit and escape from gringotts is a good ride too."
"This incredible place is not just for young kids or teens. I visited with my 33-year old Potter fanatic daughter and her 65-year old dad. When we walked through the brick wall that leads to Diagon Alley, it was truly like stepping into another world. Everything was very detailed and looked authentic. The food in all the restaurants was really good. Don't miss the train ride, Escape from Gringotts, or Forbidden Journey. Forbidden Journey truly made me feel like I was flying! We spent two full days here and it wasn't enough, I hope to return!"
"Great time, must see both parks. Be sure to stay for the light show each night.Take the train from park to park and spend the day.Donâ€™t miss Hagridâ€™s Ride, worth the line."
"We adored everything about this area in Island of Adventure. Hagridâ€™s Motorbike ride is a blast, the shows are fun, Hogwartâ€™s is stunning, the Three Broomsticks was very good, and the Hogwartâ€™s Express was fantastic. Be sure to ride Hogwartâ€™s Express both ways!The atmosphere is so realistic, the shoppes are cute and the butter beer is delicious in any form. Try the Pumpkin juice, too!"
"We are not huge Harry Potter fans, but we loved this part of the park!  Itâ€™s just like being in the movie.  Grab a wand and the decor is interactive.  Hagridâ€™s ride is one of the best Iâ€™ve ridden.  And get the butter beer."
"Well where do I start? Orlando universe is just amazing!!! Iâ€™ve been several times between 10-17 and managed to return last year with my kids, obviously with the new addition of Harry Potter wizarding world!  Well, I was in my element! Having read all the books and watched all the films, theyâ€™ve really made this look and feel authentic (apart from the weather,  no dreary London weather, but I think diagon alley was perfect in 30c heat!).  The extra special bits were the butter beer, the real fire breathing dragon on gringotts bank & the interactive wands we bought in ollivanders.   They werenâ€™t cheap ($55 each) but worked throughout the wizard of world and are a great gift to remember your visit!!!  We will be back, most definitely, in a few years once my husband forgot how much it cost to fly us all out to Florida ðŸ˜‚. No matter your age, if you like Harry Potter, you gotta go check this out!"
Iâ€™m not a Harry Potter fan but this castle was AMAZING.  We went right there right when we got to the park.  Had to try butter beer and it was delicious.  Got some great pictures by the castle. Wish I would have stayed for the nightlights overhead.  My teen loved it as well. Went in the gringots ride and that was a blast.
"Visited here as a family of 4 , unbelievable itâ€™s like stepping into hog warts, itâ€™s so immersive, the brains at universal really out did themselves, I will return for sure. Absolutely awesome."
Made our first trip to Universal and we loved the Wizarding World of Harry Potter! Diagon alley is so realistic and spot on! Butter beer hot and cold are must have! Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are also great but Diagon alley was our favorite. Enjoyed most of the rides but the simulators are not our favorite.
Had a lot of fun. Crowded but very good rides. Hagrid ride was 90 minute wait. Others we used the express pass and very fun. Really liked forbidden Harry Potter ride.
This a brilliant area of the park. Even if you are not a Harry Potter fan it is still an amazing area of the park to visit. Love all the rides and all the theming. The staff are fun and friendly and are in character. Coming from England it almost feels like home from home. All the rides are amazing and the new Hagrid ride is a fantastic addition and certainly worth an hour wait.
"Visited in February with children and grandchildren. We had a wonderful time. Park was crowded but well managed. The magic kept young and old mesmerized! Food prices were reasonable for an attraction and of good quantity. Bathrooms plentiful, normally clean and rarely a line. Shows were great for young and old. Great variety of rides and the child swap works great for all. Employees were very attentive, helpful and pleasant.  Much better than Disney parks ( sorry to betray Disney after 40 plus years)."
"I have been to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at both theme parks numerous times and I always come back for more. The rides are truly amazing, from the Forbidden Journey to Gringotts to the legendary Hagrid ride. The Express lines are a huge help in accessing almost these parks have to offer. However, my experience with Hagrid (aside from the ride itself; that was awesome!!!) was less than ideal. First, there is no Express line (I guess itâ€™s to be fair to those who donâ€™t have Express since itâ€™s a new ride) and the Single Riders line is typically equal to the posted wait (or even longer, at which point itâ€™s closed). When I was there (in February, a slow time in the season), the wait never went below 2 hours, and even peaked at 210 minutes one evening. What happened to the Virtual Line? They could easily control the queue by having everyone reserve a time in their app like they do for Race through New York and Fast and Furious. I heard that they sometimes use Virtual Line if the queue fills up, but even then it could still be a 3+ hour wait upon return. Or at the very least, Express should have SOME benefit to access this ride more conveniently, even if it doesnâ€™t involve skipping the line. (Maybe once per day on Unlimited passes, or Express-exclusive virtual line).If something like this could be implemented, this park would be a 15 out of 10. Right now itâ€™s only a 14 out of 10 :)"
"We have been annual pass holders to universal for the past 5 years.  We obviously love the place and particularly Harry Potterâ€™s world.  We live in Florida and try to go 3-4 times a year.  We used to be able to go in January and have some reprieve from the tourist crowds.  No more.  We are on our way home now and while we did manage to do most of the rides (express passes of course) the Hagrids ride was a 70 minute wait.  We tried several times over 3 days to get on with shorter wait time but could not.  The line is frustrating because people walk by (in the single rider line) when the single rider line is not open.  We asked if we could go single rider and were told no several times throughout the line.  When we finally reached the front of the line we found a single rider line up!?!?  Many people waiting in line were frustrated,  need to work on that universal!  Need to entertain more in this line, offer water, have a bathroom accessible, show Harry Potter videos -do more.  Also was disappointed with the locker fee, really!?!  $300 tickets and you charge for lockers to go on rides?  Anyway hagrids IS an awesome ride but will NEVER wait that long again.  Hopefully universal will figure it out."
"This was our 3rd time to visit Harry Potter world. We got to ride every ride, a few more than once! The detail, experience is so awesome. The newest ride, Hagridâ€™s motorcycle ride will always be remembered. Parts were unexpected but still worth the ride! The restaurants were yummy as usual. The stores are great to walk through. Brings memories of the books and movies to the front of ones mind."
"Very cool world. We know nothing about Harry Potter but it seemed to be well done. It is very busy though and there were big crowds even in the off season.Hagridâ€™s Motorbike ride- Definitely the best ride and worth the wait. Really fun. Some unique surprises. It is a relatively smooth rollercoaster. Does not go upside down.The nice thing is that the actual wait time was often shorter than the posted wait time. Some reviews say to arrive early to the park to minimize wait times. We went Jan 8-11th which was a quieter time in the park so this comment may not be accurate for all times of the year butâ€¦ we found that going to the park early to get in line for the ride was no faster than waiting at any other time in the day, especially if you account for the long line up at the park entrance at opening time. Each time we waited approximately 50 minutes in the ride lineup regardless of the posted wait time of 90 min or 120 min, morning, late morning or evening. The single rider line for this ride went really slow compared to other rides with very fast moving and short single rider lines. Note that the single rider line was also not always open. Note that express passes are not currently available for this ride.This ride malfunctions often and delays and closures are frequent; therefore to ensure you get to go on this ride, then it is best to go early in the day in case it closes and you don't get to ride it."
Makes you feel like you have jumped right into the book.  The new motorbike ride is absolutely fantastic.  Our family loves it!!
Have been to Los Angeles as well and found them equally enjoyable. Lovely to be here at Christmas time with all the lights and decorations.
"Very well built with lots of attention to details. Fun to walk around and see shows.  Rides are fun, but can give you motion sickness.  Butterbeer was good.  Go to that area during the early opening hour.  It was much more enjoyable; less crowds."
"Hate to bash Disney but Hagred's Motorbike Adventure shows what can be, instead of what once was. The ride is amazing. Harry Potter's world is incredibly clean and new and bright."
The details and accuracy of everything was amazing! Loved the wand shop and the rides were all very cool.
"We first visited Orlando in 2013 as my Wife is a huge Harry Potter fan and has been for more than 20 years. She cries with joy on our first visit each trip and we always come back with the majority of our time spent at Hogsmeade / Diagon Alley exploring the shops, enjoying the rides and sampling the themed foods on offer (I recommend the peanut butter & strawberry Ice Cream from Florean Fortescue's in Diagon Alley. Hot Butterbeer is delicious in the winter months). It's immersive and extremely well done; always very busy but I've found February is the best for us - very warm but not too hot for us pasty white English folk, and if you can take the kids out of school you'll save a packet. Wait times are always lesser in February and you'll have the opportunity to see & do more. We've been home just a couple of weeks from our last trip as I write this post but the next adventure is already on the drawing board."
"They did a fantastic job making this very realistic and fun! Felt like we were definitely in wizarding world. If you want to see all of Harry Potter at Universal, you'll need to buy tickets for both parks (and that's the only way to ride the Hogwarts Express). Makes it very expensive, but we felt it was worth it after having enjoyed it."
I can see why this area and rides are so popular even for those who have not read the books.  Find a less busy time to go.
"It is amazing waking through and seeing the amount detail involved in this magical world. It was a really great visit to see it.The downside would be that the HP rides are not set up for medium/large framed people. I could fit in the park's largest roller coaster(Hulk), but not escape from Gringotts or Hagrids ride. It makes no sense that they made the ride so limiting. Other then that, go and enjoy. Drink some butter beer and pumpkin fizz and watch out for the dragon!!"
"This is an amazing part of Universal and well worth a visit.  The detail they have put in will leave you speechless.  Do buy a wand ($60 but so worth it) at the very start of your day.... it was magical. Loved the rides they have put a lot of thought into both the ride and where you queue.I would say go here instead of Disney, better value for money."
"This is not my first time here, I've been here a few times and my wife and I love it! We are big Harry Potter fans so coming here is always magical for us. Only down side for us was that hagrids motorbike adventure did not use the express pass yet and being there on January 2nd, the wait times were insane! Hagrids had a 390 minute wait time at 9:15am. The lowest it got down to all day was 240 minutes. Needless to say we didn't get to ride it but we did everything else multiple times. Make sure when you go you watch the shows and try the butterbeer!"
Awesome attention to detail in every way. Exceeded my expectations and that of my 5 Family members that visited the park this past week
We walked in and WOW!!!  The details were amazing. Loved looking in all the shops and windows.  Plus the rides were awesome.  Only bad thing was that it is small so the crowds were very large.  A must see if you are a fan.  So many little things to see and it was amazing.
"What a great place! You really feel like you are in the books. The entrance is secluded, just like Hogwarts is and the whole feel is perfect! Try the Hot Butterbeer!"
"We really enjoyed our visit, other than one of the rides not working.  The design is fantastic, everything is well done, and we enjoyed the rides we were able to go on.  However, for the cost of buying the two park tickets to see all of it, it was absolutely not worth it.  It's disappointing that Universal broke it up into the two parks which forces you to pay for both to be able to see everything.  Falling for it was a major mistake on our part."
"As part of our trip of a lifetime. I went to the Harry Potter side of Universal with my granddaughters and youngest daughter. We went on the Hippogriff ride which was quite a short ride. The ride within Hogwarts was amazing. I confess I closed my eyes for a while as the Death Eaters got a bit much and I know one of my granddaughters was not impressed with the spiders. This may not be to every childs taste.we went on the Hogwarts Express which was really clever and everyone enjoyed and then wizzed around Gringots, my favourite 4D ride. Having visited the Knight Bus where we met Nigel and the Shruken head, both of whom were a bit cheeky, we then got the Hogwarts express back to the other side. The journeys on the Express are different each way so do go both ways.Unfortunately the queues for Hagrids ride which had just opened where too long for us to join but it sounded like everyone was having fun.I cannot recommend this enough. We had a ball. I loved Nigel and found it weird as a Londoner to be addressed by a pretty awful cockney accent which he dropped eventually. We spent some money in the shops and Diagon Alley. Harry Potter fans will be in their element.We had Butterbeer too."
