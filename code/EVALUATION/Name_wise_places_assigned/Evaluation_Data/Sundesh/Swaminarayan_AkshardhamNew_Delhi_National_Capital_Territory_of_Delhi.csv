Had great fun. The place is amazing. There is a lot to learn and it is a very tranquil place. A must visit.
"A solemn temple, magnificent buildings build up by volunteers and donations. Provide a interesting sound-light show at night with little fee. Unfortunately photograph and camera are restricted inside the area."
"A must visit for everyone. Makes you feel very proud. Very clean, very organized and so beautiful. The temple 8s beautiful, the entire complex us spectacular. The display of Indian history through tablaues is very well done and informative."
Though we prefer older sites with more history this place is beautiful!  And it gives a short understandable history lesson about the guru to whom it is dedicated. And it is an excellent value as it is almost free to get in. The food there is also very inexpensive ($2US!) and the cool products in the gift shop are also an amazing deal. Note that no cameras are allowed. But for 50 rupees ($0.75US) they will take a professional photo of you and print it out. This must be in your things to do in Delhi.
"Visited for the 2nd time after more than a decade...the place is simply outstanding. It stands out for its architectural grandeur, oneness with nature and messaging about the majesty of ancient India. You need at least 6 hours to do full justice...and it deserves them, at least!"
This is a must place to visit in Delhi. We went with our friend. We had an awesome  experience. Enjoyed thoroughly.
"THE GOOD :The place is HUGE. The place is beautiful. The temple is artistic. The inside of the temple is extremely beautiful. The statues are bling. The auditoriums for the shows were great. And the boat ride show is unique. THE BAD :1. This is ❌ a hindu temple. Not at all. In fact it's a disrespect to hindu temple. The agenda is glorification of Swami Narayan and project him as hindu god. He is NOT a hindu god. Our scriptures of holybooks don't tell about him for hindu scriptures were thousands of years old that can tell about an agenda started within 100years. The idea is to buy faith by spending a lot of money. That's not hinduism. 2. The place never tells about any gods of hinduism. We have god in many forms but the organisation tells nothing but one person who is not a god. They have built a massive statue of him and make it look like all the gods look up to him. You won't find a single word telling about other gods. It makes it sound like there is one god and that's swaminarayan. That's not hinduism. Hindus have one god but we pray almost everything in nature and all forces of nature. Certainly that one god(nirakar parambrahma) is not Swami narayan. May be he was a great man agreat sage who did good things about people and community but glorifying a great man as GOD is bit too much. And then Adjusting it to Hindu dharma. 3. There is no shade. Expect to be get sunburnt if u r visiting in a sunny day. And at the water fountain and lazor show in the evening, if it rains u r gone. No place to stand or sit with a cover on head. It rained during my visit and it was a chaos. 4. The entry is free after that everything comes for money.5. The security is HIGH!! You are not allowed to carry anything but water and money. The camera mobile the earphone the mobile charger the pen and paper nothing is allowed. Doesn't make any sense. What a iPhone charger can threat security and the wallet/coins can not. Visit  if u have time. But don't take them seriously. They don't represent hinduism."
Looks very good but the surprising part is not that old.. The details and workmanship is great.. Don't take your phone with you as it was forbidden to take.
"This modern architecture is impressive, nice detailed decoration and the place was clean.  We went on a very quiet day so we got in very quickly, no queues.  We have also joined the boat-ride explaining the history of India.  Recommended!"
Me and my children (8 and 10) had a wonderful time visiting this temple.  Beautiful artwork.  Loved that no cameras were allowed which allowed us to just enjoy the beauty of the structure.
A beautiful temple complex with must see shows and good food court. Will take minimum three hours. Extensive security checks and can't carry bags etc though they have deposit windows. Crowded during weekends. Well worth a visit
This is a unique experience. This place does not allow phones/cameras and has some rules regarding clothing. However nothing to worry about as they provide lockers to store your belongings and also a sarong to wear for a fully-refundable fee. Pro-Tip: Avoid carrying mobiles and cameras. Wear clothes that cover your arms and knees to avoid wasting time in the queues near the lockers.There is no entry fee. However they charge for the tickets tos the exhibits and water fountain. We reached the place at 6:35pm and missed the last show of the exhibitions. However we got to experience the water fountain. The water fountain show is a must watch and involves some high end projection technology as well. Tip 2: Reach the place by 5pm so that you have enough time to see and experience all the attractions.
"This temple is located on the outskirts. Good to visit with family, but too much security. Need minimum 3 hours to see it completely and 1 hour for security and other checks.Although no enterance Tickets, but no mobile phones allowed inside and need to pay Rs 50 for the photo inside the temple."
"This is probably the best temple in Delhi and a must visit if you are on a short trip to Delhi. I was completely taken aback by the intricacy of design and the peace one feels when inside. Though the check in is a bit lengthy in terms of time since one has to pass through a thorough security process, but it is all worth it. Do not miss the evening light and sound show."
"The Akshardham temple is a masterpiece. There is ample parking in the temple. No mobile phone, bags and camera allowed. Keep everything in your car. If u are not travelling by car everything need to be deposited at dedicated counters but you will need to stand in queue. The walk to whole temple is really nice and every part and engraving is so beautiful. Do not miss light and sound show. It is amazing to see the play of lights, water and sound blended with technology. The show would cost Rs. 80/ each. Duration is around 20 minutes. This amazing building is a must visit."
"This is a religious temple about 15 minutes from center Delhi. Its a definitely a must see. Here are some suggestions: Go early, when the temple opens. It gets crazy as the day goes on. We spent about 35 minutes or getting through security. The line was even longer when we were leaving. Leave most, if not all, your stuff in the car. They have very strict rules regarding cell phones, purses, umbrellas, bag packs, etc. If you have these with you, you'll have to put them in a locker (and the line for the lockers is another 40+ minutes on top of security). I literally only had my ID, credit card, and cash per suggestion by our tour guide. The architecture and art was definitely amazing, but everything was constructed in 2005, with modern machinery,  so that took some luster out of my review.  Food here is very clean, enjoyed a traditional Indian lunch. Credit card accepted."
Very beautiful temple. Have amazing carvings and inside the dome it is very beautiful. Huge garden surrounding the templethe whole architecture and theme of Axshardham temple remains same all over.Very tight security and you can take a small purse/ pouch and water .The light and sound show is amazing.There is no place to sit in shade in summers and rainy season.
The Hindu temple was amazing. There were lots of people visiting the temple. Be prepared to be pushed along the cue to enter as you will be  separated from your partner (male/female) while entering the site. With lots of people you can get lost.
"I was very wowed by the architectural presence in this place , it’s very soothing and beautiful. And even though you cannot take any pictures and you just leave your belongings outside , it’s absolutely worth it. The temple gives you such a tranquil vibe. Was probably one of my favourites in Delhi. Very safe and very relaxing. I recommend it highly."
Great temple and interesting to hear about it. Felt a little too commercialized. Long queues to enter the place.
A must-see in Delhi.  It is an amazing building that ranks up with the great places of worship in the world.  The fact that it was built in 2005 makes it even more incredible.  Do not miss it.
"Go late afternoon so you have time to visit the temple, grounds and the underground boat ride ( think small world at Disney combined with Indian history). There is a film show about the founding of this religious group; as non- believers we found it a fascinating ‘story’ to help understand others beliefs.Stay until dark for the wonderful sound and light show. It’s absolutely packed so get seated in the fountain area nice and early Entrance is free and you pay for extras.Please note you can’t take phones, cameras etc into the grounds, so can’t load any here. Men use separate entrance to women and children. Dress respectfully"
Beautiful and serene temple. No phones or camera allowed. Very strict! Don’t attempt to sneak them in.
"Splendid architecture and worth visiting place in Delhi. There is varieties of food from South to north or Chinese. Don't miss the musical fountain show. You can spend whole day here while watching the different show or just sit and feel relaxed. Ultimate example of sculptural beauty, cleanliness. A highly delighted experience one could ever have."
World class sight for exceptional and thoughtful facilities and architecture. Be very careful with what you bring to the temple as you must check all electronic devices and bags. Travel light. Only disappointment is the overkill on selling their swami and sect’s religion and I only wished to see more results of their work throughout the world and how they spread their good work and love.
"This is a huge temple inaugurated in 2005 . Was built by 7000 people for 5 years .all the temple and big surroundings are hand carved made of marble or red sandstone.The visit consists of an exhibition or actually theater scenes telling the story of the sacred founder of this special religion, a branch of Hinduism. Then the temple itself , and a multimedia open air performance based on a huge water fountain and laser illumination. This takes place at 1915 daily . Go there at 1700-1730 .admission 4 USDLRS.Very recommended"
"Had the pleasure to visit Swaminarayan Akshardham. This place is a an architectural gem. It was completed in 2002 and took six years to build. The craftsmanship and detail in the interior and exterior of this place is breathtaking. It is refreshing to know that this type of talent, which I associated with workmanship that is hundreds of years old, still exists today. We were told that there are 33 million gods in the Hindu religion (please verify this on your own) and most of these gods are represented in carvings and statues in this building. It is an active place of worship and it requires that shoes be removed when walking into the building. Shoes are placed in a bag which is handed to an attendant. There is no waiting in giving or retrieving shoes. Please be aware that one is not allowed to take cameras, food or any other items into the property. These items should be locked up in the car before going in. One should stop at a place about a mile from temple to take a photograph of the building otherwise you will not be able to capture it. Please be aware that there are long security lines to get in. Men will go in one entrance while women will enter through a different line. It is easy to meet up at the courtyard. My wife and I did so without difficulty. We are beyond happy that we had the opportunity to visit. Allow about two hours for visit"
"A very interesting temple to visit but glad we had a guide to help us navigate the area, ie the boat ride, which almost looks like a tunnel of love ride, but enjoyable and the story of the founder moving from room to room and felt like musical chairs. The grand finale was the actual light and water fountain show starting after the sun sets and was incredible. Arrive early as the security check takes time and the crowds are large, and no photos allowed, but well worth it, confusing but enjoyable."
"We visited Akshardham Temple in Delhi to view the water and light show. It was beautiful, spectacular and much much more.Some tips and info for first time visitors:The show is in Hindi but enjoyed it anyway.No phones or bags or cameras are allowed in the temple. Only small sling bags.There is a tight security protocol. Get to the temple at least 30 before the start of the show. You can get yourself some food ,popcorn and drinks in the temples and then find a spot to watch the show.It really is worth seeing and best of all only INR80 per person."
"Pretty temple, with nice carving on the outside and a complete lack of spirituality. Getting though security takes an age and feels completely over the top.  Considering this was only built in 2005 it already has large areas under reconstruction/repair. As cameras and phones aren’t allowed the site is a nice break from all the locals asking for selfies."
"We visited the Akshardham, a Spiritual-Cultural Campus In Delhi. This structure is magnificent. Taking photos were prohibited. We went on a boat ride for a short history telling journey.  Akshardham' means the divine house of God. More than 300,000,000 volunteer hours went into making the complex. We loved the The Yogihriday Kamal which is the is a lotus shaped garden.  No photos."
"This is a large cultural Complex. With temple in the middle and exhibitions (chargeable at 220 Rp for exhibition, water show and boat ride). Apparently it’s also open at night for the exhibitions. The paid exhibition, ride and show will take about 105 min. But could be shorter. We didn’t go for the paid portion because we don’t have enough time. Don’t forget the small temple behind the large temple. You cannot bring camera, back pack n food  in. There’s cloak room. Entrance is free. Expect queue time."
"Akshardham is set of stunning located on the outskirts of Delhi. Whilst once inside there is a large amount of stunning architecture, to enter there are long queues and you have to hand over your mobile phone and overall it was a stressful process. Try and visit when it is as quiet as possible."
"Monday is a Holiday! Normally, you should budget 6 to 10 hours as time taken to visit swaminarayan akshardham temple. Depending on your level of interest in the place and whether you wish to have a more detailed and thorough tour or not, the time taken can be less or more. Food at the café is delicious n nutritious."
Buzzing with crowd this place has really gained popularity in past years. On a weekend or a public holiday there are long queues. Nothing is allowed inside not even mobile phones. The campus is really big and neat and clean. Better to visit in winters . Also a laser light and sound show is performed in the evenings so plan ur visit accordingly. Typically one would need around 3 to 4 hrs to completely visit the place.
