"Spent a couple of hours exploring the ancient sites in Side. Very accessable sites including the amphitheatre, temple of Apollo and the Byzantine hospital. Well worth a visit."
"Make the temple of Apollo a part of the stunning tour of the ancient ruins around Side. My family and I were fortunate to walk the streets (old and new) of Side on a beautiful day, which made the Temple that even more amazing with the contrasting white stone against the turquoise sea and blue cloudless sky.Definitely worth taking a few hours or an afternoon to enjoy the town and all it has to offer."
Side has many Roman ruins to see which are unspoilt.  Having visited Rome many tines Side has more things you can see and touch from the Roman period. Well worth a visit and walk around all the perfect Roman ruins.
Loved visiting the remains of the temples. Also nice to see they are keeping these and not just destroying the remains. A wonderful sight. The old village of Side was picturesque with the harbour and local shops. Well worth a visit.
"Amazing ruins. Situated all around the harbour area, free access to all but the amphitheatre and museum. Still plenty to witness with many of the ruins by the roadside . A good way to spend half a day, and is very popular"
"To be able to walk around the ruins of old Side and be able to touch, see and look at the artefacts close up was brilliant. Keep an eye out where you walk though as you may stand on a mosaic and not realise."
"Enjoyed our visit very much, went back for more. Old Town is lovingly preserved, a spectacular compilation of old and new. A must see!"
"The old part of Side is just that, there are Roman avenues, an amphitheatre, remnants of villas, shops temples and more.  The bus terminates at the top of this site where there are some toilets, these are clean and cost 3 lr or 50 cent euro. There is also a museum (18 lr) which is well worth a visit. The ruins are all accessible on foot, however, the terrain is uneven. There are boards up every so often explaining what you're looking at. While walking about don't get fooled by someone saying they are an archaeological guide, they are con men who after a while demand money from you (200) lr just for telling you what it says on the boards. Don't be put off visiting because of this just ignore them, as it truly is a wonderful place to visit."
"Set beside the harbor in Side, the Temple of Apollo cannot be missed. It is absolutely free to browse, touch and take photos. Information around the site is displayed in English and German and details the incredible history of both the Temple and Side itself."
This is one of those 'must-see' sights which of course is free of charge. Dating back to biblical times the remains of this Temple provide an insight into the grandeur of that bygoing era.It is very impressive during the day but is a must-see on a clear night at sunset.It is easy to see why wedding brides seem to flock here for photos at the edge of the sea.
Visited here mid-week with kids.  Lovely location which is part of much larger 2nd century historical set of structures/ city.  Marble is well worn as expected but they are doing a lot of restoration nearby.  The site is on the sea so lovely breeze most of the day.Itâ€™s hot so take plenty of water.
"Lovley ruins of temple of Apollonius, took some great photographs  .  Imagined going back in time . Saw a. Couple having wedding photographs taken ther so beUtiful."
"Itâ€™s a beautiful temple and impressive ruins but thatâ€™s it. Itâ€™s in an area that isnâ€™t looked after at all. The temple had been restored badly and the rest of the area is just open with ancient rocks strewn everywhere. Thereâ€™s no information available, no staff and itâ€™s absolutely strew with litter. It looks great at night all lit up but the hundreds of people taking selfies with it make it hard to appreciate. Make sure you set a side a good 5 minutes to visit."
Amazed at the area these ruins cover over the old part of Side. Worth a visit when coming here and use the free bus back to the dolmus after exploring
Amazing experience andceasy access to the old town and amphitheatre. Can easily access via local bus outside the hotel. 7TKL. About 1pound. Cheaper than JET2 price. You can access all the surrounding area via local bus/ taxi service. It's cheaper and safe. Don't waste money via jet2 rep or TUI rep. The choice is yours!
Visited Side early June. What an amazing place. So much to see and so much history to be discovered. You walk on glass floors with ruins under them . The temple of Apollo is situated near the harbour. We firstly visited at sunset. What a beautiful sight!
"Visited the temple June 2019, 2013 and 2008 still very nice to look at, great for a photo. Lovely place"
Be sure to walk around these fantastic ruins. Can't believe its free to do so. Well preserved columns and archways to be seen.
"Sitting near so many other antique sites in Side, this is surely one of the best for a photo opportunity. Absolutely steeped in history and is complemented by multi language information boards throughout the area.Amazing."
"A fantastic combination to feel and learn a bit of history and enjoy the amazing photo opportunity. In between the sea and the harbor, the walk towards it is a pure pleasure. Do not mind the shops on the way as they are overpriced and money-oriented. Just enjoy the scenery and these amazing accomplishments of human civilization. It is even more fascinating at night"
"Loved this site,I just can't get enough of places like this steeped in history. We got there via a lovely seafront walk and spent about an hour just soaking up the atmosphere.....outstanding"
"Situated at the Marina with beautiful sea views and lots of bars and restaurants, the Temple of Apollo is a lovely place to stop and take a photo or 10 day or night. Eat at Ocakbasi restaurant whilst you are there. (Thanks me later)"
Loved this bit of Side. The temple makes for some great photos come sunset! Looks fantastic lit up at night time too.Also worth a travel round the coastline on one of the many boats moored across the harbour.
"The temple is uninteresting and the Old Town of Side is best avoided entirely.  The town is horrible 1970's buildings, tacky stores selling fake YSL bags, Nike shirts etc and crooked shops keepers happily overcharging tourists.  Don't go there even if you are staying in a nearby hotel"
"Loved visiting here, especially around the evening time.Amazing views, well worth the visit. Itâ€™s well lit at night time too for visits. If you are in Side, would recommend temple of Apollo."
Go in the evening for an amazing experience transporting you back in time! A beautiful bride was there having her wedding pics done too ðŸ˜Š
Jumped on the bus to the old town for some shopping and came across this. Very pretty with good photo opportunities we went early morning so it was empty. You could grab a boat trip from the harbour whilst your there.
Go and visit. A walk in the ancient area is a must! Beautiful night and day. Free to visit! Beautiful walk around the harbour!
Went here several times when visiting side. Beautiful setting with a lot of history. Excellent for photos in the day and night.
"Went on a very hot August day, the temple is in ruins but the facade impressive. Worth a visit, free to walk around."
Amazing views. Great to witness a bit of history with a glass of vino in hand. Looks great during the day and amazing at night when lit up..
Didnâ€™t realise they close within 30mins patter arriving. The people at the entrance couldâ€™ve advised us or not charged us for entrance. After entering within 30 mins was called to leave which I was fuming but couldnâ€™t do much as to leave but the overall sight and scenery was breathtaking. Had a short stroll around the area.
This attraction was so beautiful when lit up at night. Spectacular site. Worth the walk. Took lots of photos.
"Located just next to the harbour, so we linked the trip here with dinner and went at sunset, a great place to take pictures and soak up the culture. Many people were seated around this area, having a drink and watching the sunset"
"Side- small city and Roman temple near by the sea. Wear comfortable shoes , lots of walk, nice place to take photos."
