"A few years ago I would have said that this is one place that is as Goa as it gets - great live music, mix of cultures, great stalls selling unique trinkets, handicrafts, and great food. It was a truly Goan experience. Now - bollywood music, okish food (who wants to eat an ok Domino's in Goa), stalls are tourist traps with things you can get at any other place. Give this place a pass. It's a hassle to get in and park and just to see ok things.If you are around, head to Anjuna for some great digs instead."
"I am rating this average just because of the highly priced products sold in here! Otherwise it's really fun to visit the market. Colorful, vibrant and cool place. An open air stage with some good performances makes it worth visiting. Open bars in the market play some good music too.I would advice not to buy anything in the market as they are all overly priced. The spices sold are expensive and the same thing can be bought at a very reasonable rate in Mapusa market which is open everyday! However, it is fun to walk around in the market and appreciate the products sold in here. Leather jackets to gowns, hats to boots, handicrafts to paintings, lanterns to candles etc.The bar counters are pretty reasonable. The food court is nice and i suggest one has to try it. There is so much variety in there one can't stop drooling at some of the counters.The market, which is highly priced in my view, is nonetheless worth a visit!"
Visited the Saturday market in my last trip to goa. This place is quite an attraction and is packed with a lot of people. It is advisable to take a cab or walk down to this place. The roads around this area are generally jammed. The market offers a lot of street goodies to choose from. One needs to bargain as the products are over priced. There are multiple options to eat.
"This is a very large market selling a lot of the tourist tat you see near or on the beaches, but also a very more unusual items. Expect to spend around 1.5-2 hours here if you want to walk down every lane, more if you want to stop and listen to the (excellent) live music. I visited on my own as a solo female traveller and felt safe. If you can arrange a return taxi do, but there are plenty available outside. My taxi cost 1400 rupees return to the Lemon Tree, my driver waited outside for me. Be careful on the prices. For most items expect to haggle on everything to between 20-50% of the price initially stated. The 'walk away' tactic works well, although I was pursued for a good 5 minutes down one lane by a disappointed trader who kept slashing his prices in the hope of getting a sale.Entry is free. Worth a visit for the spectacle and experience, if nothing else."
"We happended to drop by the flea market recently and it was a good venture. Lots happening with lots of nice looking people from various countries. Interesting stuff on sale with live music. Ample parking with no hassle. Note: There are 2 such markets located within 1km distance in Arpora, Goa. One is on a huge scale and the other one is on a humbler scale. The humbler one we liked it better!"
"Come Saturday evening, and it seems the whole of Goa has come to visit the flea market. I was impressed with the way the organizers manage the traffic and thousands of cars for parking. The market has so many stalls, more than 1000, I think. However, it’s only called a flea market, the prices of some of the apparels and stuff are higher than some of the international brands. But it’s not just the apparels u get there, the market has lot of other stuff to shops from, spices, teas, jewellery, bags, crockery, home decor, etc etc. It has lot of food stalls and bars as well of different cuisine and live band performances too! Makes for a very colourful evening/ night!"
"Something that you must do once!! Did we buy much? No , are a lot of the stands the same ? Yes. However my husband bought a great pair of vintage sunglasses that he loves and I bought some fun costume jewellery . We had a few beers some great street food and listened to all the music and people watched for 2 hours! Would def reccommend! Take the mosquito spray though!!"
"Try to go early as it gets very busy-7pmish.Organised, clean (except for the toilets), lively (live music, fire shows, catwalk etc) & good bars around.The food is also supplied by some of the well known restaurants but I am a little concerned about how they store it in the heat? Stick to vegetarian pizza!Many different stalls, most selling tat but some are good- avoid the spices (get the Organic stuff from the shops) & a lot of the woollens are not!All kind s of people- a very friendly safe atmosphere.Good car park."
Visited the night market and kinda wished I hadn’t bothered.  I really enjoyed the food stalls and the music was great but the stall holders are non stop badgering you. I get it they have to sell to you before you move on to next stall but it’s so off putting. Highly exaggerated prices so you have to haggle and it gets tiring. If they would just put a price up and let you get on with it they would sell so much more. The atmosphere was good around the music area and I tasted some food I had never had before. So that was a bonus.
"We went both Saturdays!Food is brilliant and and such a good time walking round! Make sure you visit. The food is safe and so worth having dinner there.Full of live music and shows. Try and get there early as it does get really busy later in the night,"
"Substandard goods. Really not the best of Indian goods on bargain.. anyhow it's a highlight of goa, so the tourist would do it as a ""thing to do"" for an Indian traveller o would've been happy to see authentic indian crafts being offered.. this was shabby to the best.. hippie & substandard maybe cheap but not tasteful at all! Didn't eat here.. but lots of food stalls and clothes and accessories. I brought a pair of leather hand made slippers. That's it!"
"Had read mixed reviews about this market. Have to say it was fine, just what you would expect from a tourist market, everything you don’t need but think you wantPrices were good today with bargains to be had if you haggled. Don’t take their first price and if there is a price you want to pay tell them it’s your final offer, if they can’t accept they won’t."
"Unless you like iper-touristic markets, there is no reason to go there. Everything sold is very commercial and overpriced and the only people you will see around (also many stall owners!) are western ones, so we didn’t like it at all."
"Gone are the days when the night market was a laid back affair where one could go to while around and have a good time. The night market now is crowded to capacity, where jostling crowds of tourists and fun seekers vie for space along with stall owners and food joints. Parking is a nightmare. I have been there once and Im not going back. The cheap trinkets are available at the Tibetan stores which are like any Delhi street market, the actual good stalls are over priced. The food is non descript and slightly suspect. For a first timer it may be one to cross off the list. I dont think anyone would want to go back."
"Good for food, live music and everything you may want to buy from a market stall.  Gets busier later evening and goes on until the early hours I think.  Opposite the doubletree Hilton. Plenty of parking."
Loved this place.Yes as other reviewers have written you maybe able to buy from shops at similar prices but this market is more than that . It’s a party vibe with live bands and a bar and lots of food stalls. This place is a vibrant fun place to have a drink and people watch. I’d definitely recommend it once just for the atmosphere.
"Firstly I guess its a must visit, especially first timers to Goa. Its fun, food is good, entertainment can be great and yes there are bargains. Treat the whole thing like a game if you shopping, adopt a ""I dont care if I get it or not attitude"" if you cannot get the price down walk, keeping walking and they will often tap you on the shoulder, coming down lower and lower.You may even feel insulted by now as the desperate bartering from them is possibly a third or even a quarter of the original price. Just go along with it, walk around and gather the best prices and go back round, you can get a bargain but take the time to educate yourself on the way round or you will pay too much.TOP TIP - The seller knows his cost and wants to sell so put on your Poker Face, make it fun your on Holiday afterall"
"We got here around 5.30pm as part of a group, was booked through Thomson. Journey wasn't the best and transport was poor for a Thomson brand, driver needs to stop breaking so hard. Markets were just starting to set up so not much atmosphere and lots of stalls still empty, overall we did manage to get a few bargains (make sure you go half their price) and it was good fun haggling. Food didn't look appealing/hygienic enough to eat so we just had a pizza and opted for vegetarian. Had two hours here and it was more than enough time. I would suggest getting here around 7pm so you get a good feel/vibe!"
Market is not good. Recommended only for western music lovers. It was good. Food quality seems average. Must go for music. Enjoyed a lot.
"A must visit place. Visited it during night and was almost there for 3 hours. From Indian items to jewellery to some vintage things, one can find everything here. If not for shopping you should at least visit it to have a look at it. There was a place playing dj and it was great. There are a lot of food stalls here so it was an amazing experience in all."
"There are different night markets in Arpora, this review is for the smaller one. Great ambience to experience the Goan atmosphere, good food, drink and entertainment. The Italian pizza and coffee and cake stall was very good and genuine. Drinks fairly priced, makes for a great fun night out. Note to the organisers......please change the group who comes after ‘Gilbert’ as they were terrible and in Goa you are spoilt for choice for live bands😀"
Busy but good experience mainly for clothes.  Barter away and try your skills. Loads of stalls of clothing spices and jewellery in the main.
"Went there unplanned. Stayed for hours. There were so many stalls in this lively market. I bargained for all the gifts items to take home, thought I got a pretty good deal (probably not).  The live music acts were a treat. Great live performances. Also circled the food stalls..  they have everything from authentic Tibetan momos to hotdogs, to Indian Street food."
Went to the Saturday night market was good nice things there a lot is over priced a gentleman wanted 6500rs for a small wooden box with elephants on I got him down to 1500rs be prepared to haggle or walk away Music is good. A lot of none Indian sellers aswell
"Visited the same stalls outside of the market at their base stores, and the prices were much more cheaper than what they sell their stuff for at the tourist market.  However, still worth the stop and atmosphere and always good to support the markets, no matter their price!"
"Was in Goa for couple of days and decided to visit the Saturday Night Market. Arrived early and enjoyed the more quite time at the stalls as it gets very busy from around 8pm. Good food and entertainment, and some unique items for sale. Be on the lookout as you can overpay for some items if you not firm with sellers. A must visit when in Goa"
"The market is bustling with shops and food carts. You can shop till you drop and get excellent bargains too. The shops offer anything from clothes to gift items to home decor stuff. With more than 100's of outlets, you are sure not wanting to miss it. The food stalls have ample seating spaces too outdoors during evenings making it a pleasant experience. Located well in the city area makes it easier for everyone. But make sure to bargain big time...."
"Is amazing market. I love it. Be carful though. There is. Now 3 Saturday night markets. When I tried to go last week, the taxi drive took me to a new one called the Saturday night bazaar, it was very busy, but was horrible, was so dusty and cheap stalls. He told me the original one was closed. Whilst there a someone told me the original one was open. So I tried to get a taxi there but none would take me. In the end I Got one. At last. It is opposite the Double tree by Hilton Hotel. Anyhow once I got there it was amazing, the food and music and atmosphere was great. Lots of good bars, same ones as last year though, but still just love this place. Makes me feel like I’mBack in Goa again for real when I come here. Food is really nice too."
"Be it shopping, live music, local marketing...all in one at Arapora night market. Reminded me of the ingot night market. Must go if in Goa on Saturday night."
"Enjoyed our visit to the market. Not one for doing this sort of thing, but I really enjoyed it and my wife loved all the haggling for unique gifts to take home. Live music, food and drink with 100's of stalls selling their wares. Make an effort to go along you are sure to find something to suit here."
Visited and was not disappointed. Lots of local goods for sale. All the traditional fare.There was also a food section selling hot international foods.Worth a visit.
Had a brilliant time here yesterday. It was packed but everything was good-natured. Shopping was really good and better than Anjuna.  The food area had something for every taste but with a Goan twist.  Music was loud enough to hear throughout the market and heavy rock. Get a taxi or tuk tuk to get there and have a ball.  Enjoy!
"This is a must for anyone travelling to Goa. The Saturday night market is the place to be whether you want to shop, drink, eat of just people watch. Traffic is very busy travelling to the night market so i'd suggest taking a Tuk Tuk or cab. On arrival you are greeted with many stalls with Goans awaiting you to barter with them for their produce. At then side of the venue there are many food outlets and all are very popular offering a wide range of food covering everything from traditional Goan/Indian to Italian to Nachos. In the middle of the venue is 1 bar which must make an absolute mint selling alcoholic products. Just to the side of this is the band stand area which has a range of live music and dancing. It's different every Saturday. It's great to just find a seat and take in the views and people watch. Further to the side again is what I can only describe as 'a Russian trance disco'. This took me back to my youth with trance/house music playing loudly with lots of lazer lights. There is a other bar here and it's mainly Indian visitors with other continents many of which looked like they'd travelled to Goa on a gap year and never returned home. I always felt safe here and returned every Saturday as the atmosphere was amazing. I picked up a few bargains too by haggling and i'm glad I did as I got my gifts at a fraction of the price. Don't be afraid to be cheeky. They love the banter!A must if you are visiting North Goa. Over Christmas and New Year there was a festival held in the neighbouring fields with many international DJ's. The venue was electric. Slightly devastated I didn't have tickets but realised i'm not 21 again!"
"This is one of the highlights of my Goa experience. We went by taxi from Calangute 500 rps . We arrived around 8 pm and it was in full swing. Loads of stalls from bags, spices, clothing, jewellery, pashminas, throws and lots more.   In the centre there is a stage with music playing and fire eaters. Plenty if seating. There is a big section selling wonderful food. . Be prepared to barter for lots of bargains . We were still there at midnight and there was still plenty of action."
"Loved hanging out there with friends , great place for nice live music and variety of food options. . One can pic cool handicraft items as well.."
