"Beatles Ashram was a major attraction for foreigners and it was free. Where they created very nice Graffiti, painting around the Beatles Ashram. Now Indian government took over this place and cashing out :) Entry time to this place is from 9am to 5 pm Entree fee is Rs 600 for foreigners, Indian Rs 150..under 18 it's free so I sent my 7 years old son and he took some pictures inside it. Even though Rs 600 is the entry fee, I have seen a foreign lady entered it paying Just 300 or maybe less (not asking for a ticket). This trick may help you... Welcome to India :)"
Disappointed that the buildings have been vandalised. Still a magically place especially when some sings Beatles white album as you go round
"It’s a great plan to do in Rishikesh. The place has peaceful vibe and the art is so cool. I listened to the Beatles while walking there, it added more magic to the experience. Don’t forget to bring repellent for mosquitoes and if you are in a group, you can ask for a discount but the price it’s very reasonable for western standards."
"Since the Beatles set foot in Rishikesh in the late 60's , this place has been a tourist attraction for anyone who is interested in Yoga and meditation. Impressed by the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi the Beatles flew down to Rishikesh and stayed at his ashram which is now famously known as the 'Beatles Ashram'. One can take a look at the eye - catching graffiti and paintings done by the visitors on the wall of the abandoned ashram."
"Being a Beatles fan, this place is steeped in history. Must see place for every Beatles fan to understand where they found their inner peace and fulfilment which lead John Lennon & co to make great music inspired by Love, peace and tranquility"
"Tucked in and part of a tiger sanctuary. Must visit especially for those who love art and architecture. Better visited during the day. Takes a few hours to cover the ashram, comfy clothes, shoes, camera and water to be carried. Has a small Cafe but unsure of operating hours and food options. Recommend nature trail walk around."
"Maharshi mahesh yogi Ashram, which is famously called Beatles Ashram as they lived here for a while . Built like igloos, many of those small units , dedicated for each of permanent members of ashram, gives a different experience... its in the midst of jungle, offer peaceful and calm atmosphere for meditation.. now ofcourse abandoned .. you see many Westerners who are Beatles fan visiting the Ashram... I don't recall exactly but there is heavy entrance fee as well.."
"One of the must visit attractions in Rishikesh, you can feel the amazing energy and beauty here !! I visited this place during my yoga teacher training in rishikesh with my friends. Did meditation and enjoyed the silence and peace. Although the cost seems expensive, it is run down so need some attention from local people or government to keep it lively and comfortable for the tourists."
"Swarm Ashram now know as the Beatles Ashram, highly recommend if your a fan or not. Amazing to know your walking the same path that the iconic Beatles did."
"We visited ashram and the fee for foreigners was 600 Rs. At first it is too extreme for seeing ruins. The second - the place belongs to Forest department but the fee is taken by Gauhri Range office. This is not official entrance fee of the Indian government.  The ticket provided is company's recreipt. When we talked about it, we were bullied by the person who collects the fee. Do not recommend anyone to pay illegal entrance."
"We were in Rishikesh during the Kanwa Yatra festival. Thousands of people flocked into this city to participate in such a big religious experience. So we decided to escape the chaos and hid away in this abandonded ashram. The ashram was so ruined, but we could imagine its greatness. The roof of small ashram was designed into the shape of mushroom. So cute. You can find a lot of amazing graffiti. In the triangle shaped building, we knew later that we can go up to roof top to take a paranoma view. Yet we didn't go, because it looked so abandoned and afraid someone was expecting us up there... *Mosquito everywhere. Be prepare."
Overpriced to get in do did not go. Other people said not worth it. From looking in on yhe outside very run down... such a pity.
"Loved to visit this Ashram!! You can really imagine how life there was! I loved the stone huts, the main areas... so green... definetely is worthy a visit."
"Beatles stayed here at Maharishi Mahesh Ashram some time around '68. There is a small museum which has Beatles photographs from those days. There is a big theatre kind of hall with Beatles murals (probably done by various artists). Otherwise the place is in quite a dilapidated state and only a true Beatles fan will find it very interesting. If you are staying on the other bank, you will have to cross the river over Ram Jhula, turn right and walk till there is almost no road. (20-25 minutes). Then turn left and it gets you to the steep walk to get to the Ashram. Enjoy!!"
"Long gone are The Beatles, together with all other people who frequented the Ashram of Maharishi Mehesh Yogi in the 1960s. However, the site is still worth visiting if for no other reason than the peace and solitude it offers for a morning.  Get there when it opens to avoid the crowds..."
The area is absolutely fantastic. You can reach the temples walking the street on the back of the area. There are 2 entrances. The main entrance is easy to find. The second one is more difficult to find. Keep on walking till you see a path marked with white stones and follow it!The temples are really suggestive. There are several things to see during your promenade. It was a sort a micro village by the river. Closing your eyes you can easily feel how beautiful this place it used to be. Now it is in ruins and it is a goldmine if only it would be restored. Even like this it worth a visit!
Is good for couples. Me and my soulmate meet first time here. Its very fabulous place. I like the art. It is still on renovation. I love it . for indian citizen its only 150inr so according to mee its excellent place in Rishikesh for couples. No body with disturb you.
"I visited the Beatles ashram with a friend during my one month stay in Rishikesh. At the moment it is a tourist attraction and it's left to its own destiny and slow destruction by the forces of mother nature.The place is beautiful and peaceful. We found some great pieces of art on the walls most probably done by a local artist. The potential of the ashram is great and I really hope that someone takes it, restores it and makes it function as ashram again as it has really great vibes for this purpose. The territory is big with nice greenery and access to the banks of the holy river Ganges (which is currently not accessible and needs some cleaning and maintenance).The unique architecture of the bungalows made out of the river rocks makes you feel as if you are in one of those adventure movies.The accommodation buildings are big and can accommodate plenty of people. Climb the stairs to the rooftop terrace to enjoy the view and the art on the domes.There are several meditation halls for group practices.It's really sad that the place is turned into ruins. It can be a great location for the International yoga festival.Make sure you have couple of hours to explore the ashram without rushing and may be find a nice quiet spot to sit and meditate."
"Now this is something you have to visit. It's an abandonded ashram but full of calm and deep energy. Foreigners pay an entrance fee of 600 rupees, and walking around the whole land will take up to 1,5-2 hours. Go in the afternoon when the light is smooth and you can take amazing photos for your Instagram. There's a small cafeteria, but the thing is just to walk around in empty buildings, look at the artwork on the walls and just let Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ashrams energy to sink in. And very near is the tree where Papaji (Mooji's master) used to give satsang when he was in Rishikesh. It is the biggest tree just outside the entrance, ask the staff if you don't find it."
"I went to the beatles ashram in February. The ashram is located on a hill adjacent to Ganga. Make sure to carry your student ID card for a discount on the entry fee. The ashram is abandoned and as you walk through the buildings, you cannot help but admire the beauty of the entire scene. Check out the graffiti in the buildings and auditorium"
"It was strange to visit the Beatles' Ashram in Ram Jhula, Rishikesh, for their 50 years arrival in India, in fact Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Ashram of Transcendental Meditation. 600 Indian Rs for foreigners' entry fee, it's a lot for ruins of TM headquarters, but the meditation with International Yoga Festival 2018 Sangha of Parmarth Niketan Ashram brought Love Life Light Laughter to what appears a dead place, except for the artists' paintings and graffitis all over. Great also to have sung John Lennon's 'Imagine' with beloved Bhakti singer Daphne Tse in company of all Yogis & Yoginis present from over 100 countries around Pujya Swami Chidanand Sarasvati ji. Let it be! Aseema Om Tara"
Interesting if you remember the Beatles and their trip to India to study. Read about it before you visit.   The area is poor but the people kind and generous. The Sikh Temples have frequent festivals and we were invited to join in song/dance/music and given meals.  See the student art work on the flood wall along the river downtown Rishikesh.   The Ganges river is cleaner than downstream and used daily by believers.
"The ashram is now the gateway to a lion preserve and little remains of The Beatles visit. Yet it’s cool to sit inside the #9 pod where it’s said Lennon wrote Revolution #9. The dilapidated cement barn is worthy of a visit for Camera action of Beatles and Maharaja graffiti. A must see when in Rishikesh, budget 90 minutes and an easy hike from Laxman Julha. Beware the 600+ rupee admission cost."
"This place is completely ruined however the ashram's architecture is not to be missed. Located at a distance of about 2 kms from ram jhula, the place is associated with history of Beatles when they came here to practice yoga. The place is not maintained properly but still you will be amazed to see the many rooms where Beatles would have stayed. The main meditation hall is full of graffiti and very lively. Should visit this once at least."
Visit this place and set aside an entire day for the visit. Keep exploring the prayer halls and the bunglows and find interesting wall paintings.The forest dept charges rs 300 as the entry to the place but this is totally worth the price.
"It is Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s Ashram which now lies abandoned. Beatles apparently spent a year here. The new name is probably just to attract foreign tourists. It is part of a natural tiger reserve. The route is not signposted and can be easily missed.Inspite of being unused, it has a unexplainable spiritual energy attached to it. It also shows how advanced Maharishi’s ideas were even in the early 70s. Anyone with a spiritual interest will love this place on a small hillock overseeing the Ganges. Makes you wonder how can you abandon a place of such natural beauty and energy.Give yourself a couple of hours to explore and don’t miss if you are in Rishikesh."
"Maharishi Maheshyogi made this masterpiece in the 1960s...it become famous as Beatles Ashram after Beatles visited the Ashram in 1968.It was abandoned for many years till recently the forest department opened it for visitors. A must visit place while in Rishikesh for the architecture, the hundreds of small kutirs which we're meant for meditation in its hey days, the paintings that adnorn the walls.It's a explorer's and a photographer's delight. Go towards the morning times so one can click pictures in good light. It's a long walk around the Ashram so people having problems walking may find it difficult. Otherwise a great place."
"I'm not a big Beatles fan, but enjoyed my visit to this Ashram. Liked the meditation huts, scenic surroundings."
"OK. So archaeology people are gonna find this place interesting. They will figure out couple of stuffs about structure and all here. For others, it might not be as enjoying as it sounds!This is mainly abandoned ashram. Old structures and peaceful environment. There is like hill-top view there from where you can see Rishikesh city and Ganga river.There is entry fee of 150 INR for Indians and 600 INR for foreigners. I don't see this fees justified as they are not maintaining this ashram up to the mark with fees they take. I am not asking about rebuilding the place. Just cleaning the place perfectly, maintaining daily cleaning and adding more information everywhere. Adding sign boards and guiding tracks and all. There is a lot of things to be done to make this place nice without disturbing its core.e.g. You can't meditate in meditation caves! They are like dark creepy places!.. Any good someone ever done to this place is just large graffiti here and there. They make you feel good there. Big buildings are like scary houses. People even hesitate to enter them & they don't what which passage is safe. Guiding tracks would help them here."
"Charing more than 600 from foreigners and almost nothing from indians is no fair and terrible for the things you can see. It's kind of racist, they should threat all tourist the same!!!!"
"Hauntingly beautiful abandoned ashram  - go for the architecture and quiet natural setting.	Way beyond my expectations.  Don’t miss this, even if you are not a Beatles fan.  The abandoned buildings are hauntingly beautiful.  They are now part of the nature preserve.  There were no hawkers, peddlers, trash or beeping scooters.  The peace and quiet was fantastic."
It was quite far from where we was staying (@ the Laxman Jhula Bridge). It's best to hire a ride to get you there because you'll be walking around seeing the buildings/area.  The location and religious vibe helped shape the Beatles mind and help their creative juices. Make sure you make it further back in the compound to see the 4 or 5 story building that housed many who stayed there during the Beatles time. There are quite a few and humorous graffiti on most if no all the walls of the building. Definitely one of the most enjoyable places we visited while in Rishikesh.
"The place is very nice and despite being abandoned you can really feel the energy that led the Beatles to compose so many great songs. It offer great places for pictures with Graffiti in the background and and a nice photo gallery.Tough the visit is worth it, be aware that is overpriced, costing 600 rupees (about $8) for tourists. Just as a comparison sightseeing places in India charge less than that. Seems a bit to much for a place that does have to much maintenance cost."
"It's more or less a MUST to visit this Ashram when you either grew up with the Beatles or if you're really interested about their songs especially written during their time in Rishikesh. It's a pity that nobody cares about this special location, to see the dilapidation of all buildings. Take your time walking around, enjoy the fantastic nature , the great view and of course the chance of putting your foot into Ganga Ganga Mata"
Amazing place to go and chill. Enjoy the sound of the river gushing along on the side. Gives you time to reflect on your thoughts
