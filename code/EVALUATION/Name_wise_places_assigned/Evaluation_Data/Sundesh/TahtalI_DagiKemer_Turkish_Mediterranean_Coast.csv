Loved the cable car trip views as we travelled up the mountain - great experience. Mountain top - views not quite as good as the cloud & mist came down quite quickly on the day we visited.
Brilliant trip .. Pick your day to make sure weather good. Views fantastic on a clear day. Maxwell tours let you book on the day .. Costs less than through your holiday rep too!
"Well worth a visit. Spectacular views both driving up to the cable car, from inside cable car and from the top. Organised this trip with local tour firm Maxwell's slightly cheaper than Thompson's. Downside is that the cable car is packed and on the return journey people tend to think that they don't have to queue,this was mainly Russians who seemed to use this method every where."
"it is a spectacular view not to miss, easy to book and the cable car is safe and easy to get on.  Make sure you go."
Great half day out with stunning views of the snow capped mountains and the fantastic coastline.  Shakespeare café was reasonably priced for lunch.  Take your gloves and wrap up during early season as it was minus 7 at the top.
"You are 7000 ft up a mountain, with great views. Pick your day. Even on a clear sunny day you can have cloud around the summit so check first. Cost around 30 euros (£24) from Kemer. £48 if you book it through a rep."
"Visited on an organised trip on a morning of blue , cloudless skies. A little crowded in the lift but no problem and well worth it at the top . Didnt bother with the professional photographers , took our own instead and worked out fine ."
"Traveled by cable car to the top of Tahtall Mountain and what a great trip it was, a beautiful vista opens before you and it is in more ways than one breathtaking. We booked through a local tourist office in Kemer (Maxwell Tours) and the service was good. It was also cheaper than going through the hotel rep. We saw some people paragliding off the top of the mountain but not for me though. At the top you were able to get refreshments and a snack if you wanted to and the service was good.Just be aware of the photographers at the top they were a bit in your face and started to take pictures of you even when we said no.It was a great experience from beginning to the end."
"It was amazing !! We enjoyed our trip, definitely something to do if you are in Turkey!! I was a bit scared at first but everything is great and smooth. The professional pictures were such a good quality. Thank you."
"Sorry, guys, will not write too much, just simply  - go there! Unfortunately I got there with no snow but the view is still amazing. Really worth going. Starting from escalator and then the view to the mountain. Though the price for a ticket is a bit expensive."
"Visited here in August with family. The problem with a pre booked excursion is that you can't book the weather as well. We were lucky as the clouds that often surround the peak cleared long enough for us to enjoy the stunning view and get pictures. Take a jacket or warm cardi as even in the heat of summer the peak is cold to freezing.The cable car ride to the summit is an amazing experience in itself although again low cloud banks can obscure the view. The cars take eighty people a time so it can feel a little claustrophobic. If you want a boarding tip it would be this. Eighty people are counted into a boarding queue with a scanned pass. If you can see from the queue that you are not going to get by the window hang back make yourself last to get on that means letting everyone board before yourself. As you step on to the cable car the doors close behind you, turn round and you are right in front of the glass doors. A perfect view. Be aware of the summit photographers they insist on taking a stack of pics this way and that. It can work out at hundreds of pounds for them. We nearly paid £200 sterling for 18 pics that we really didn't need."
Visited this place with young kids. This tour does not require a tour guide. Just needs a taxi there and back and entrance fees can be paid when you reach the place. It’s called Olympos Telefrik.
"Visit up the mountain on the cable car was amazing. The views were staggering and watching the paragliding was breathtaking. There were even patches of snow still up there, considering hot hot it was down in the valley. Well worth the visit."
went here on the cable car you feel like your standing on top of the world it was breathtaking. the cable car ride was exiting and heart pounding
"We done this trip as part of a day excursion. Getting from the bottom top the top by cable car was an experience in itself. Apart from the stomach churn when the car goes over the pylons it was a wonderful climb. As you ascend to the top the views change and it seems like you will never get to the top, overall I think it took about 10 minutes. When you get to the top well all I can say is WOW. We had a good morning where the were no clouds so the view was something not to be missed. There was some snow and it does get quite cold so take something to cover up your arms that will keep the chill off. I used a sarong which was sufficient. There was a couple who decided to parachute down, off they went and within a few minutes the cloud came and they were no where to be seen. I believe the parachute jump has to be pre booked in advance.There is a slingshot ride and this seemed popular. We spent roughly 45 minutes on the mountain and I think that was more than enough time to take photos etc. We had a coffee in the café that we thought was not over the top in cost. There is a small souvenir shop and professional photographers who want to take a picture of you to purchase. They were a little bit annoying as it took 3 or 4 no thanks and a final very sharp NO for them to go away. The trip back down was as amazing as the trip up. I would recommend this as a break from your hotel if you want something to do that is quite tranquil but has that WOW factor"
"Took a trip to Tahtali because didn't want to spend all the day in a bus or walking in heat with children. And it was a great choice! Children were excited by 15min way in cable car, rather speedy with amazing views around. On the top : it is different Turkey - more calm, even more impressive. Sure that everyone will find his own way to spend some time there: a thrill on sky jumping or a drink in a bar - definitely incredible feelings :)"
"Who would have thought what should have been a 10-min prep to jump off a cliff would leave me spending half a day at the Tahtali summit? At 2365m, we were told Tahtali is the highest mountain near the coastline in the whole of Europe so we just had to go paragliding off it of course. Come the morning of our adventure, we took the cable car taking in the silence and spectacular views of the Mediterranean reaching the summit in less than 10min. Once kitted out, the wind changed direction so what should have been ten minutes spent at the top to get ready and jump off became a three hour wait for the right weather conditions. What else to do but enjoy the cool mountain breeze on a hot and humid August day and the delicious mint lemonade – one of the best I have ever tasted – at the Shakespeare Bistro while enjoying people-watching. There are quite a few day trips here so there is always some action at the top including of course the catapult which looked super fun but at $25 a pop we weren't going to be persuaded to give it a go. Instead, we took a little walk with one of our pilots from the west to the east platform - not for the faint hearted but the 360 degrees view of the pine trees and the sea was well worth it. ps. If you ask the cafe waiters the chances are they will tell you the wifi doesn't work, just snoop around for the password and you'll find it written across the building. :)"
"Tahtalı Mountain is a majestic mountain in the north of Kemer. Ascending the peak point of 2365m with the aerial tramway, you can see the heart stopping landscape of Çıralı and Olympos beach. You should certainly have a cup of coffee and if you have enough courage you should try paragliding. Don’t forget to have thick clothes cos it’s cool up there."
"During my summer holiday in Beldibi / Kemer, I made a trip to Tahtali summit of mountain Olympos. This is the highest mountain in Turkey with sea overview. According to mythology, Olympos is named ""The mountain of Gods"" and its summit Tahtali of 2365 meters is place where Zeus met Hera.I booked this trip at tour desk Tez Tour at my hotel. Also, travel agencies as like TUI, Jolly Travel and other ones organize this trip. If there isn't any mentioned tour desk at your hotel, there are numerous local travel agencies near your hotel as like Ginza Travel, Maxwell and other ones that organize the same trip. This pleasure cost me 55 USA $.I was picked up in front of my hotel and bus drive lasted for 40 - 45 minutes from my hotel in Beldibi to the lower station of cable car. The ride by modern, new and safe cable car lasted for 10 minutes and it was so interesting, full of excitement. When I got at Tahtali, I was rewarded with stunning view of Mediterranean coast and sea. It is really fabulous experience when you have an ice cream, cake or drink and at the same time you enjoy spectacular view. This was an excellent escape from heat on the beach. I refreshed my body and my soul had a beautiful rest.There are possibilities for daily and evening visits. For better photos choose morning or sunset visit. If you are a romantic soul, you could book evening visit and watch sunset. As I know, Wednesday and Sunday in August are reserved for this pleasure. Meeting point is lower station of cable car at 19.10 and ride to the summit is at 19.15. If you are adventure type, then you could take paragliding flight. Tahtali is the highest paragliding center of the world. A flight on average lasts for 30-45 minutes and anybody can fly from the age of 5 with a licensed instructor. Landing point is on the public sandy beach in Tekirova. More information on www.escape.com.trThe future visitors, whatever you choose, have an enjoyable time!"
"The Tahtalı/Olympos Mountain Range is a remarkable natural beauty in Antalya. According to the ancient Roman/Greek Myth, these were the mountains of Gods. You have a chance to reach the top (app 2300m) via a sky lift. You can go to the sky lift by bus/car. At the entrance and top station, there are cafes. At the top, you also have some  chance to make paragliding."
