House boats at night are a waste. The amazing View is great all day & would recommend to do only day tours & not to stay in the house boats. The boats are parked all night & it gets quite boring. Mosquito repellent is a must to carry.We learnt that the water that is used in the house boat (to clean & washroom) is the same river water that looks really dirty. Drinking water is different. Recommendation : DO NOT STAY in the houseboat. Day trips are Wonderful.
"A great way to pass a day and night on the beautiful and interesting backwaters of Kerala. Breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and snack and dinner included. Bring your own preference of beverage as you won’t find any on board except for tea, coffee and water."
"Lovely overnight stay on the backwaters in a house boat. Booked by Kerala tours, the boat was large clean and had the basics. The food was amazing and simple the fish boat at the local hut supposedly caught that day was cooked up for us, but wasnt cheap. The bathroom a little…"
"Seeing the backwaters was one of my favourite parts of traveling across India. If you are an active person, I would personally recommend taking a kayaking tour. It's a great way to explore the narrower canals."
"Visited in Year end holidays of December 2019. These backwaters are simply awesome. The houseboats are top class, well maintained and clean. The boys served delicious meals with authentic Kerala fish fry and other dishes with mouthwatering coconut based curries. Hospitality at…"
"Had a wonderful time cruising the backwaters of Kerala with Evergreen Tours who had been booked to provide this part of our tour by the local agent. A really lovely boat, very comfortable viewing seating and separate dining end, and the bedroom although quite a tight fit was more than adequate. With just two of us together with the captain and cook we had one of the most relaxing experiences of my life! The food was excellent and the pace of the boat just forced us to relax, (especially with no wifi!!). Saw fish eagles, lots of kingfishers, cormorants, egrets etc.Only criticism was a lack of directions for our pre dinner evening walk once docked and we ended up lost and walking back across paddy fields to find the boat again!"
"Sunglasses are a must. You will find plenty of boats, where you can hire one for taking you around the backwaters for a couple of hours or higher. Check and take the boats that have good reclined seats. Once on the boat, just relax down and enjoy the greenery around, view of coconut trees, and cool breeze.Time of visit: Not recommended when it is very sunny.If you are planning to reach Allepey on a private car from Kochi, I would recommend taking the road that is parallel to the sea, not the regular highway."
Fabulous! Johnson is very helpful and our room was big and clean. Loved the houseboat but the canoe trip much better.
Remember !! You are in Alleppey. There is no other great experience than taking a backwater trip via Shikara boat or house boat. You can book boat via government centre or near jetty points. Price depends on how you negotiate but normal charge would be between 300-700 INR per…
"We had booked a heritage deluxe houseboat for an entire day and night. It was an amazing and unforgettable experience for us, ConsOur houseboat got delayed by half an hour which should not be the case. As checkout is at 9 and they get good 3 hours for everything.It was little dirty. Considering what I am paying I expect much more cleanness. I could see some spider webs etc, lizards, and we had booked a double decker one, so top portion was not at all cleaned. AC service was provided only in night (though it was told before) but there was no fan in houseboat and it was hell hell hell hot. For us as it was double decker so it was little better. Please confirm on this if the houseboat has a fan or not. For us when we complained they gave a small cooler but it was pretty useless. So don’t rely on these.There were no soaps tissues provided. No dustbins in bathrooms. All these minute details were missings.Pros: Amazing amazing amazing experience. There were in total 3 members in houseboat. One cook, one captain and one for other works. They were nice people. When we entered they served us with welcome drink . It was pretty tasty. All the meals were very tasty and they paid heed to any suggestion we gaveThey were very punctual with time, There usual time to give breakfast is 8 but we requested for 7 and our breakfast was ready by 7.We needed a cake on the boat for some celebration and they provided us with one. It was very tasty."
"The general idea is nice. You rent a houseboat for the night. You board at 12:00pm abd start cruising from the river to one of the canals, back to the river, then to the lake. You stop for lunch and continue cruising till 5:00pm. You have dinner, stay to sleep on the boat. Get up in the morning,  have breakfast and cruise back to the starting point.  We had the whole boat to ourselves with a cook. The food was great. The room was nice. The route was not interesting enough.  All the boats sailed on the same route.  The only difference is probably the price"
Spent the time on a houseboat operated by Evergreen tours. The three person crew looked after us so attentively. Food was to a very high standard and the crew ensured we had adequate alcoholic beverages. The scenery and our integration with our surroundings was terrific. Highly…
"Did 2 trips in a Shakira boat - there are loads available and the rate was 500 IR per hour. We did a 3 hour and a 5 hour tour, both good - but the 3 hour tour was probably best, going down the narrow channels. The large houseboat are a bit of an expensive scam, as they don't go…"
Been there many as i am living in Alleppey.  One must be there in his lifetime to feel the breeze and silence of the nature. Avoid March-May time though due to extreme heat
"One of the highlights of our trip to Kerala. Didn’t know what to expect, but we really loved the day on the water. It’s a beautiful area, with stunning views."
"We have been to the backwaters of Alleppey previously some 8 years ago. Our first visit, also overnight, was a brilliantly sunny day and the colours of houses, people in canoes and boats with palm trees and rice field back-grounds was stunning. This time, not so much. No doubt the overcast day affected photo opportunities. But there are so many boats now. Some channels were just too busy. And while our lunch stop was well situated overlooking rice fields our overnight stop was alongside local housing. Not unsightly, and actually the local life provides some of the best photo opportunities, but I would rather be ‘with nature‘ than near people on this trip. Reasons of limited open ground, paying for overnight mooring etc etc were offered as reasons we couldn't move. Where the boat will park overnight and what route you might be taking to get to some quieter areas will be questions for further trips or perhaps one or two operators are or might start working different areas. All questions I’d ask if recommending to anyone for the future. Having said all that don't be put off making a visit, overnight is different and can be quite stunning."
