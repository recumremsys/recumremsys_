"Had a wonderful afternoon here. Beautiful views of the water, itâ€™s near the beach and cool water to swim in at the lagoon."
"Went for a morning walk through the lagoon area, fantastic sunrise over the water. Atmosphere was very relaxing. Plenty of very kind people also enjoying morning walks, jogs, triathlons and yoga ðŸŒž"
"What a great place to relax in the water. Its clean, lifeguards on duty, depth of water varies and there is some shade in the shallows. Changing rooms and toilets, tables and grass areas and its free. Nice."
Lovely place to relax and take in the views of Airlie Beach. Lovely clean well kept pool without the sand and saltwater. Had a few long days spent here. Good for all ages with a kids section with plenty of shade and good clean amenities.
"Those views are amazing, such a pretty part of the world to relax with the family over a swim and bbq. Shaded playground area for the kids and loved the shaded pool area to. Loved the relaxed atmosphere and the weather was perfect! Wasnâ€™t even that busy which was great. Clean and tidy with great clean toilets and change room facilities. Iâ€™ll definitely be back."
"Lovely location in the middle of Airlie. Great way spend a hot day, plenty of shade, grass & places to get good food. Thank you Airlie."
Nice and deep pool perfect to jump in after a walk along the boardwalk. Wasnâ€™t too busy and water was a perfect temperature
"Beautiful, clean lagoon. Great for a swim, paddle, or to play with the kids as different areas with different depths. Life guards on patrol in the day. Also grassy areas to sit down and relax. Changing cubicles and toilet facilities all really clean too. Right on the waterfront too if you did fancy a dip in the sea or wander to the shops."
"Great place to swim safely and relax, plenty off space to sunbathe on the sand or grassy banks. Views off the sea and surrounding area. Great access to free barbecue, facilities for changing etc spotlessly clean. Nice cafes for drinks and food! Take something to lye on if your used to a sunbed!!"
Lovely spot for everyone especially young kids and families. Has lifeguards and both shallow and deep lagoon.
Had a very enjoyable afternoon relaxing. Great for a swim too. Lifeguards patrol the area which gives confidence to families.
Beautiful man made lagoon for a swim. Has kids pool and adults allows for plenty of free areas to swim without being on top of each other.. set next to airlie beach and shops. Plenty parking near by aswel
"The lagoon apparently the largest salt water pool of it's kind lovely spot to lay in the sun and swim . With all depts of water it's safe for everyone.  Has changerooms, toilets,out door shower to rinse,and fresh drinking water to refill your containers. We went on two occasions and never over crowded."
"Great swimming location, a large space. Great view near ocean. Caters for all in lap pool, kiddies area, deep and shallow. Bbq area. Woot of shady areas. Great to even have a sleep on the grass. Relaxing even thou it's busy. Life guards on duty."
Had a great relaxing hour swim in the morning at the lagoon. Quite a few people in the water as well as a number of people sunbathing. The pool looks great after the recent repairs and upgrades and its also very family friendly. The water temperature  was also really nice.
Don't need a hotel with a pool if staying near the lagoon. The kids loved the lagoon. It seemed to be very clean. There are lifeguards there too during daylight hours which is good. Was very busy the day the cruise ship was in town but still heaps of room as it is such a big area.
Stayed across the road so we visited the lagoon several times during our stay. Great that it has big spaces of different water levels. Toddlers could walk around in the water without it being too deep.
Loved the zero depth entry and the shade. Sat and had a picnic while the kids splashed safely. Close to lots of different food outlets. Clean toilets.
A great idea across the foreshore. Free well laid out pools and picnic areas. Seemed to be very popular. The car park was used as a camping ground in the evenings mind.
"Clean and accessible facilities with pockets if shade to enjoy if you're not lapping it up in the Lagoon.  Play ground for smaller children near lagoon too.  Lifeguards on patrol (school holidays), which we thought was a great service."
Beautiful crystal clear water big enough to swim laps and up to 2m deep. Surrounded by great landscapes on waterside. Beach is tidal so good option for swimming all day safely patroled by lifeguards.
"Spent the day in this lovely spot.  Fantastic markets with sme great buys, great selection.  The lagoon is a beautiful spot to have a dip and just relax and have a picnic lunch.  Safe for kids."
This is a huge lagoon with different areas and depths. Much larger than the one in Cairns. Nice lawn and play areas around it as well. Shade areas and barbecues.The water was freezing when we were there but a lot of children and some adults still were in the water. Everyone was having a great time.
Great place for a swim when you cant swim in the ocean because of stinger season. Felt like we were in the beach.
"THE LAGOON IS A NICE FREE LOCATION FOR LOCALS  AND  THE MANY VISITORSBack in the day, the AIRLIE waterfront was nothing to write home to mum about, with typical QL coastal town mangrove frontage. Then local govt. thought if they clean it up they could keep the many visitors who came to take cruises into the nearby WHITSUNDAY ISLANDS  for more than the night before and after. Worked a charm â€“ this precinct is now real nice and these days I would not hesitate in making AIRLIE BEACH my base for a week or more.Accommodation providers responded in offering a big range of places from backpackers to high end and CRUISE SHIP operators have decided to make their WHITSUNDAY base AIRLIE rather than more offshore on the lee side of WHITSUNDAY ISLAND.So what we have here is two irregularly shaped pools â€“ the north-east abt 50mx24 â€“ the south-west 90x40. The latter has a very shallow end suitable for non swimmers and kiddies â€“ there is a small section of beach lining this end, This pool also has a few lap swimmers lanes about 70m long. Both pools are surrounded by sloping lawn areas. There are palms. boab trees and shelter sheds for shade plus spacious grassed areas to spread a towel. The treated saltwater was very clean and refreshing on a warm day. No shortage of rest rooms, showers and lifeguards..Sweet.TI[S â€“ for a short excursion take the path on the seaside of the pool a scenic 900m north west around the headland to CORAL SEA MARINA, In the opposite direction it runs a similar distance to the new PORT OF AIRLIE development past rather nice parklands, condos and nearest the lagoon an okay beach. I remember this area as a mangrove swamp in the 90s - it has been nicely cleaned up and the beach has a stinger/croc enclosure which I urge you use â€“ the east end still has remnant mangroves and looks a mugger haven.- the lagoon has no food franchise but one of the bordering accommodation places has set up a nice bar/cafe with a good outlook over the complex. More range is available in the main street 100m inland."
Perfect spot to go for a swim and spend time with friends. Lovely lifeguards on patrol and an excellent atmosphere all round. Located nice and close to all the shops and restaurants. Excellent for families as there is a beach entry as well as a deep end for the more adventurous.
Nice swimming area for families. Shaded areas and access to shops if you are needing something to eat or drink.

"After walking to the lookout, immersing ourselves in the lagoon felt like paradise. Excellent beachfront central location. Various pool areas to suit all swimming levels. Lawn and shade available to lounge by the water. Seems to be a safe social meeting place for young people, as well as families an mature adults. Attentive lifeguards in attendance. Car park nearby ~ $3 for 2 hrs. No charge for lagoon."
Set in a very scenic area. Clean and inviting. Showered available. Close to centre including restaurants overlooking lagoon. Plenary of shade and shelter.Will be bringing the grandkids up here to enjoy in the future.
Yes thatâ€™s it.  Looking for a lap swim on your lazy holiday?  Lagoon pool has a circular 50 m stretch. Watch out for the sun. Crayfish after 4 km uninterrupted swim in the awesome pool. Locals and overseas tourist with any lap Trianon easily fall into rhythm for a fabulous shared swimming experience.
"A great oasis on the foreshore at Airlie Beach where you can swim, sunbath, eat and reax without worrying about crocs and stingers. Is quite large so you don't feel like its crowded."
"Beautiful swimming area, on the beach, and right in the centre of the resort. Was badly damaged by the hurricane in 2017 but has now been restored to all its former glory."
"Good for kids and adults. It has toils, benches, changing rooms, shelters and restaurants around. Clean area with rubbish bins. Take your mat or swimming stuff to sunbath:)"
"Stopped here to check out location. Fabulous purpose built lagoon, with family friendly & disabled facilites, as well as free barbies & picnic tables. Numerous access points to lagoon, from ramp to stepped with rail, & varying deptha suiting toddlers to Olympic swimmers. There's even a lap lane section in the middle. Beautiful views around the bay, with plenty changing rooms & toilets as well. So artificial sand beach arwas, but also direct entry from stone type surfaces, & grassed areas to lounge on as well. Beautiful."
