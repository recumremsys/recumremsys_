New scarecrow displays.  Be sure to look for the Grim Reaper of lost trademarks!  Make a reservation as attendance is limited.  Suggest early morning timing.
"Loved the creativity we saw during the Alice in Wonderland exhibit!  Easy to navigate around. No parking available on site though (lot full all day), had to walk through the giant adjacent park to get there and had only 2 hours until closing to visit.  Still worth it though."
Visited for thanksgiving and wow!  Simply breathtaking and a must see if you are ever visiting Atlanta!
"Made reservations on line for this event. Staff begin putting up lights a couple months ahead. There are places to stop for a hot drink or to make your own smores. The lights are stunning and digitally coordinated with the music. Creative displays. We arrived at dusk and enjoyed part of the exhibit in the diminished light. We retraced our steps later after dark and felt treated to a brand new display. Park staff clear all the visitors out at 4pm, and light patrons begin arriving at 5 pm.  Great for couples, and also fun for families with kids."
"Attended a work event here. Some very cool sculptures, and love the Alice in Wonderland displays - so detailed!"
The Atlanta  botanical garden was AMAZING!! Come early to beat the crowd and the best photos. You want be disappointed. There's plenty to see and alot of walking..
"The Garden Lights Holiday Nights display at the Botanical Garden is great. If you are in the area during the holidays do not miss it. Be sure to buy a s'mores kit, roast a marshmallow and enjoy this childhood memory. This outing is good for families and out-of-town guests. Food is also available. Plan on about 2 hours for this activity and arrive early as the line to get in and park starts to back up quickly."
Took our teenage daughters to experience the Alice in Wonderland sculpt and we were pleasantly pleased. Hats off to the associates that put in the time to create these works of art. My wife was impressed by the hanging orchids. It is about a 60 to 90 minute tour to see the gardens. I feel that the admittance price was high in comparison to what is offered to the visitor.
"Put this on your must visit list.Plan on at least 3-4 hours. The garden is beautifully laid out. The walkways are wide and well maintained. It is mostly wheelchair accessible though there are areas with steps or non-paved surfaces that might be a struggle.There are plenty of places to sit, many in shaded areas. There also restrooms conveniently located along with water fountains. Though the water pressure was a little lacking, many of these were also water bottle fill stations.I ate at the Quick Cafe which is INSIDE the Longleaf Restaurant. Probably the one thing not made clear on their garden map, nor is there great signage outside directing you to the direct entrance to the cafe. The food was fresh and priced reasonably."
"The entire garden is lighted up for Christmas from November 16 to January 11. Book tickets online in advance as there are limited entries daily. However, we saw that tickets were available on site also but the queue was pretty long. For viewing the holiday lights, the entry starts at 5 PM. Parking is available inside but is limited so if you reach early parking will be available inside the garden. The park is very busy and the parking may take 20-30 minutes. Parking charges are 10 dollars. However if the car has four or more passengers, the parking charges are 5 dollars.  Regular parking rates don't apply for event parking.Entry ticket is priced at 39.95 dollars for adult and 36.95 dollars for child 3-12 years old.Movement is one way. Wheel chair friendly.Food and drink kiosk just after entry but difficult to carry food drink and camera as you walk as some areas have dim lighting.The whole park is beautifully lit and the scene is breathtaking with multiple lights all over.Central vista has musical lights. Sitting benches provided in the area of musical lights and the adjoining bridge. Few eating places inside the park. Snack bar serves drinks, sandwich and hot dog. The Long leaf restaurant has seating but the menu is limited.  Around 7.30 PM one has to wait for an hour for getting a seat. A cafe in the same hall serves only sandwiches and drinks.Smores available.at 3-5 dollarsDowntown view is very goodRainforest and Orchid garden worth a visit. Kiosk just outside the orchid garden serves beer/wine and nuts.Washroom in the orchid garden is clean and there is no queue. All other washrooms, especially the one at the entry/exit has long queue.Time required is approximately 2-3 hours."
"We visited the Christmas Lights at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens recently.I probably should not say “Christmas” lights sine there is very little of the many beautiful displays related to Christmas. All we saw in that regard were I think three camels and wisemen. Again, I think they were camels and wisemen! Nothing else that we saw of a Christmas nature! Maybe we were expecting it to be and maybe we should not have! But it’s not! But all the lights were very pretty.Was also very crowded but not to the degree of distracting - lines and crowds move smoothly. Was a very long wait in line of cars at entrance - it’s a popular place! And still was a couple of hours later waiting on a taxi. It’s a very popular and busy place! We also had reservations and ate at the Longleaf Restaurant - DO NOT recommend doing that. Very noisy. Very expensive - ($3 for bread!), no salad with expensive entrees. I had the salmon which was ok but over almost cold wild rice. A very limited menu. Use the other options of snack bars and “smores” booths! Again, a nice place to see lots of lights but not much related to Christmas and main dining facility a bit of a rip off. But do recommend a visit and probably a beautiful place in day time in spring, fall and summer just for the gardens. Not a “bah humbug” review, just an honest one!"
Awesome lights and cool effects. The green lasers in the hothouse withe frogs reminded me of what a dark rainforest must be like. Don’t get the 3D glasses. You’ll use them for 5 minutes. Do get the hot chocolate with kaluha.
"The holiday light show runs mid November  to early January. Adult tickets start at 29  (for members). But well worth it.We went as family this evening.  Went early (5pm opening) to start before sunset. It took us full two hours to see everything.  The section with lights and music synchronized was the highlight. They had staff all over to help with questions and directions.  They now added some one way sections for simplification . In at least two places they had staff set up to take pictures of you with your camera Dont buy the 3d glasses, only filtered lights into snow flakes or snowmen.  Smores were great. Whole family enjoyed the evening Parking may fill, so go early or wait 2+ hours for it to ease up. Back entrance to parking may be better."
Go for great walk amongst beautiful trees and gardens. Attend the cooking show. Wrap up with the canopy walk.
Enforce requirements that adults wear masks and social distance. I had a terrible experience today with lack of Covid Safety precautions and will not return until the pandemic is over. Multitude of children without masks running and screaming everywhere. Parents unconcerned.
"An amazing variety of flowers! Take the time to walk through all of the pathways and corridors so you dont miss anything.On a side note, be prepared for the heat during the summer and stay hydrated."
The Botanical Garden is beautiful all year round. This year is a special exhibit with Alice's Wonderland. Take a relaxing stroll through the gardens and definitely visit the Orchid House! Highly recommend.
There are many interesting things to see in the nooks  and corners of the Garden! There are currently very creative scare crows and all forms of pumpkins . There are amazing huge  flower sculptures of Alice in Wonderland and even a wooly mammoth thrown in.  Kids will like to see the live frog exhibitions of all colors of tiny frogs- including yellow! There is a tropical rain forest to stroll through and a huge show of orchids .There is an outdoor pavilion that has a wonderful view of the Atlanta skyline. There is also a lively restaurant to have a meal in the midst of the garden. There are sparklingFountains and a nature walk on a raised bridge over a wooded area . Coming soon is the display of Christmas lights that gets better every year.The Garden Shop is full of lovely gifts for yourself and others. All during the year the Garden has a wide variety of educational programs for all ages.
Well organized with thousands of varieties from around the world.  Comfortable resting spots and cheap parking.  Located in Piedmont Park
"Went to the gardens for Garden Lights on Christmas night. Wonderful! Hanging lights were awesome.. Had campfire smores treat, my son enjoyed it.  A must if you are in Atlanta during the holiday season."
Loved the gardens! The Alice in Wonderland exhibit is great. We love the gardens and enjoyed our visit!!
"Bought our tickets online before we went, saved money that way! We went on Saturday, November 30th 2019 and our night was nothing but fantastic and fabulous! We decided to book and stay the night so we wouldn't have to worry with parking. We stayed at the W Hotel Midtown, it was only about a 10 min walk away. Highly Recommend staying there is you don't wanna get caught up in all the traffic! We walked there faster than the traffic was moving and once we got to the entrance they had a sign up that said ""lot full"" so I do not know where people parked after that? Since I had pre-bought our tickets online we didn't have to wait in any line! Walked right in! Was handed a map of the lights, and we were on our way! The lights are just amazing to see! We took our time, and took it all in! Made for a really relaxing night! My husband and I stopped and had some Hot Cocoa with a splash of Irish Cream, it was really good! Our daughter roasted herself a s'more (extra charge of course). Our time here was really fantastic and we will probably be making this a yearly family event! If you are thinking of going here don't hesitate buy your tickets online and go you will not regret it!"
"Beautiful garden, a little expensive, but worth it.  Themed topiaries change regularly and are fantastic. Some areas closed due to a Covid 19"
"Parking was cheep 5.00 per car load, Tickets were 21.95 dollars each. Exhibitions for Alice in Wonder land were too few. Although there was a great dragon to look at, and three camels? which I did not read about in Alice in wonderland. We went on the cocktail night it was 90 F 12.00 dollar mixed drinks in a 8 oz glass filled with ice before the liquor was poured. 7.00 beers. For the two of us we went into the only air-conditioned restaurant which had maybe 25% of the tables full and was informed there was no place to seat us. Because all the tables were full (all reserved ). So in the same area we bought some poor ham sandwiches and drinks and a sweet. For the two of us cost 30.00+  (I've had better meals in the school cafeteria), and we ate in the area that were told we could not.  I have been to golf courses that have had fans blowing on greens to circulate the air, the Atlanta botanical Garden obvisely has not heard or seen this or even considered this even in there outdoor eating areas. The place is wired for there xmas show wires are run all over the place. COME ON plug in a fan. I do realize they need to make profit some where but being reamed as a customer. I will not be back."
Get your tickets online before hand. Trying to find tickets once you're in the park is a bad idea. They sellout very fast. You can purchase the one of Membership deals which isn't bad. We spend $105 for two adults and you get to visit as many times as you can during year from the date of purchase. There's a lot of exhibits. Don't expect the same ones as they switch them up. Really nice for the family. Military discount. Mask are required.
"The Atlanta Botanical Gardens is a magnificent experience, indoors and outside. Alice in Wonderland themed topiary added to the experience. Be prepared to do some walking (hills and bridges included) if you intend to see everything, which is our recommended was of experiencing this unique and large garden complex. Wear comfortable clothing and dress accordingly for the weather. A good restaurant is on premises, so you can get a respite from a sultry summer day in Atlanta and refresh yourself. To do it right, allow about three hours or more."
Loved the visit! The Garden lights were just amazing. I especially love the Woodlands lights that changed to the sound of music! I have always wanted to visit the gardens and so glad that it did not disappoint! Looking for to my next trip to visit again!
"All of the indoor exhibits and biodiversity building were beautiful, well put together and very interesting. However, the map we received upon entry didn’t have anything labeled and we were lost most of the time we were there. Still worth the trip. Paid $20 per person upon entry."
Drove from Alabama to see these Christmas lights. Best I have seen. Enjoyed walking around the gardens. Making s'mores was fun! Will be back next year.
Wonderful! Expensive but worth it!   Choreographed light displays with music were absolutely fantastic!
The large plants in the shape of Mother Earth or the White Rabbit from Alice and Wonderland were really well done. Loved the bridge over the wooded area
"Love, love, love this place. Became a member as soon as I moved here. Great place to visit all year round and bring the family. Spectacular shrub topiaries, great holiday light show, great concerts on the lawn, nice gift shop and a great little restaurant.                     William Carty"
"This season the sculptures are truly fantastic and impressive in size.  Also, many groups have created individual arrangements for Halloween that demonstrate much effort and ingenuity. A trip not to be missed.   Suggest going during the week and arriving at opening before busloads of school kids if that is your preference."
"The botanical gardens are a beautiful addition to your visit to Atlanta. There is no scenery quite as pretty in all of Atlanta and the gardens are well maintained. I would go in the afternoon because nothing seems attended to in the morning hours, and there was no one working the few out door stands at all. Also one might think about going in the cooler times of the year because it is miserable hot in late summer no matter where you are in the gardens. We spent every moment near water features just dipping our hands and cloths in the cool water to cool off. They should consider installing misters like Disney parks use to refresh their customers throughout. The new Alice in wonderland plant sculptures were cute but not huge. Many of the other sculptures were much better, like the Phoenix and the dog and dragon. The orchid exhibit was very well done and many are within sniffing reach which was a plus. Look for the chocolate scented orchids. They are incredible and the kids will get a blast smelling them. Though it is very pricey to go to the botanical gardens here in Atlanta, it’s still nice to see them. You forget where you are for sure, for a while."
"Very beautiful clean place. No pests I probably saw one caterpillar lol It’s the end of the quarantine and I wanted to get out for my anniversary so we went there, the cooler months might be better for those who don’t like the heat right now because all the buildings are closed. The paths can be confusing so make sure you open your email📧 for the Map 🗺 because you could miss something you didn’t see. Wear comfortable shoes because there’s a lot of walking to do. Can’t wait to go back for Christmas 🎄"
