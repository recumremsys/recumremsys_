"The buildings and grounds are impressive, both in size and clean architecture. The museum portion is well-done and quite informative - think of the George Washington of modern Turkey. Be prepared to walk a fair amount and go up and down in elevation, but it is a nice place to visit."
Very historical and beautiful. An amazing place to visit. Gives the life of Atatürk and really pays tribute to him and his greatness.
Although this is a memorial to Ataturk and his role in founding modern Turkey - it is not just of interest to Turks. There is a museum attached to the mausoleum which gives a good insight into the man behind the nation. Although it is quite nationalistic it is still very interesting to see. The whole complex is kept beautifully and is an oasis in the busy city. Be prepared for strict searches coming to visit this place.
"Besides paying tribute to the greatest man in Turkey, this visit is an excellent opportunity to learn about the Independence War, as well as all thr other reforms made by Ataturk.If you don't want to rush, and considering some queues for some areas, allow yourself 3-4h to visit the whole site. Go as early as possible!"
Very awesome historical museum with lots of stories to be told. Love the carvings om the walls and the interior of the building. Get a glimpse of the changing of parade where soldiers will be marching across the parade ground close to the vistors.
"Anitkabir is a symbolic of this city , grand , simple but amazing . I recommend take a look inside the museum carefully you will understand why Turkish respect this leader . Do not forget to see the soilders there , they are awesome with great body and perfect face , i can say the most handsome soilders are in Anitkabir ."
This monument should be on top of things to do in Ankara. Check opening times online before visiting. Entrance is free.
A great history lesson . The information and set up is great . Loved the car and the personal belongings as well as the history reminder. Views from the top spectacular.
On the road to the Mausoleum and museum of Ataturk we were given an in depth history of this almost universally revered father of the nation. Going through the large museum for an American without a cultural attachment to the man might be like asking a Turk to spend a couple hours in a  US revolutionary war museum or George Washington's Mount Vernon. But one can feel the reverence felt by the population and I gained a sense of respect for this great general and statesman
"Stunning location, incredible achitecture. Definitely a must see, take your time and enjoy walking around. Visit the museum, you got to know a lot about Turkish history!"
"This is a great mausoleum for Turkey's founding father. Built cleverly, one can realise the contributions of Ataturk to the country of Turkey and the world through this place. One cannot help but be fascinated by its sheer size, the vast expanse of items on display and the very fact that one is standing in the same complex in which the leader was buried. I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this place as a must-visit for Ankara. Expect to spend 1 to 2 hours on site,"
Our guide took us to Mustafa Kamal Attaturk Mausoleum which also is a Museum. The place is pretty impressive with lots of guards standing at places in full attention just like those standing still st Buckingham Palace. Saw Attaturk cars and boat which were on day display. Lots of tourist were there in the morning which added a nice atmosphere to the place. We were fortunate to witness a graduation ceremony of soldiers who were near the main entrance ground and had to wait for 15 minutes before we entered the mausoleum. Our guide explained that the actual grave was downstairs but we didn’t go down since we had done lots of walking.The place was drenched with history and we really came to know what Attaturk had done for his country.A must visit in Ankara.
"This was quite a spectacular visit and informative about Turkish history. If you're there long enough you get to see the guards changing which was very interesting.Staff were wearing masks, there were some points of sanitiser dispensers throughout, the museum was closed to prevent spread of the virus, and there were limited access restrictions in places like the souvenir shop. Saying that, not all tourists were wearing masks, and the amount of people in main areas like the mausoleum and memorabilia showcases were not monitored.Unfortunately, there's a lot of stairs throughout Anitkabir, and I did not see a single point for wheelchair access. Anyone would this restriction wouldn't properly access the landmark, and wouldn't be able to visit it comfortably."
"This mausoleum gives a visitor an appreciation of modern Turkey history, which was marked by Ataturk's leadership post Ottoman Empire. The building includes a museum of Ataturk's life and his many achievements in modernizing Turkey. However, the many sub sections that present his achievements, in the walk through museum wing, are pretty extensive and one would take an hour or so to complete the viewing of the exhibits. Depending on one's interests and time constraints, one could just focus on the early section presenting Ataturk's life and military history."
Large area including the mausoleum and side buildings.  Was able to watch the changing of the guard which is always impressive. The main entry is lined with statues of lions.  There is a nice view from the terrace.
"One of the few tourist attractions in Ankara.  Worth a visit to understand the reason Ataturk is held with such esteem.  Talk to the guides, quite a few speak English and they are willing to explain anything to you.  Watch the changing of the guards.  Spring is a good time to see the gardens.  If you really want to understand why Ataturk's picture is everywhere in the city, read the book The Star and the Crescent first, it gives an amazing insight in to the life of the man"
"If you're in Ankara, you must not leave before visiting this mausoleum. It is certainly one of the most important monuments of Turkey. I'd advise visiting when it's less crowded, be it very early hours or in the period outside of the tourist season, because the crowd can ruin the experience a bit. A museum is also included which has an interesting collection related to Atatürk and the beginnings of the Republic. Don't miss it!"
"I think you cannot really visit Ankara without visiting Anitkabir.It’s architecture is interesting and it’s kind of simplicity makes it very monumental. And monument it is.For me, a Nordic visitor, the importance of Atatürk is fascinating. The museum around the mausoleum gives you an idea how loved he was and is. I saw many families and couples taking photos Anitkabir on background and studying the museum very carefully.I recommend this place because its importance for Turkish people, there’s something special how they talk about Atatürk, the father of the Turkey. Based on what I saw I think he was a man with academic background but he could touch the people of Turkey by the way he spoke. And being a soldier finalized his heroic status."
"This is an utterly fascinating place!  You cannot miss it, even if you are in Ankara for just a day.  Basically, it is the mausoleum of Ataturk, but there is much more to see than just a tomb.  The whole place is paradise for photo and history buffs.  You enter the central area through a broad road, lined with statues of lions.  At the end of this road is a huge courtyard, with Ataturk's tomb on the left and a museum on the right.  You need at least two hours to see everything. It would be good if you can budget three hours.  Wear GOOD walking shoes, there is plenty of walking to be done.  People with a stroller may have some difficulties, there are quite a few stairs.  I did not see arrangements for wheelchairs, you may need to check.  Little kids may find this quite trying.  Also, I don't think this place would appeal to teenagers.  But, if you have even a little interest in history, this is indeed paradise.  So much information on modern Turkish history, on Ataturk,  on his life, etc...etc...  And so many photogenic buildings.  I went by taxi, the driver dropped me off at the main gate.  It was quite a walk, uphill, to the Lion walkway, and then there was more walking.  There must be some way to directly access the Lion walkway.  If so, you can save yourself a long uphill walk, and also save a lot of time!  It is perhaps the most impressive mausoleum in the whole world.  It left me with a sense of awe."
"Seems that every tour to Ankara is taken to Anitkabir.  It's OK and offers some insights into the hero-worship that Turks have for Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic.  But the mausoleum itself is not all that impressive.  Built in similar style as the mausoleums of Ho Chi Minh and Mao Zedong (actually, I guess they came after), it's just a big-columned structure idolizing the founding leader.  The mausoleum is stark and bare inside.  The most interesting part of the visit was seeing the school groups and how they behaved during their obligatory visits, and the changing of the guard (which was interesting but not as impressive as some other such exercises in other countries).  If you have limited time in Ankara, better to plan to spend more time at the amazing Anatolian Civilizations Museum."
"If you are visiting Ankara in your trip, this place is definitely a must to visit to learn more about the Independence War of Turkey and the founder of Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Give yourself at least 2 hours and wear appropriate clothing as it is a spiritual place."
It was a solemn and  moving experience.  Well worth doing at least once.  Wear comfortable shoes.  It is a bit like a pilgrimage.
"They say when you come to Turkey you should visit this museum/mausoleum to pay respect to their founder and hero, Mustafa Atataturk.  Its a very nice place mostly made of marbled structure surrounded by a well manicured garden grounds. After touring the place in probably about an hour or less, I'm afraid there's not much else to see other than just wander around and take selfies. Try to witness the changing of the guards if you stay long enough for some added attraction."
Saw the changing of the guard - worth watching.  The museum had a excellent depiction of WWI from the Turkish view point.  I recomend this for everyone to visit.
A comprehensive curation of the life and achievements of Ataturk. A great way to learn modern Turkish history.  Peek through one of the windows from inside the building to view Ankara city.
Anitkabir is a MUST see when visiting Ankara.  Take an afternoon to stroll through the place and surround yourself with the wonderful history of Turkey.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite busy but we were still able to get around and see all the sights.  Anitkabir is a great spot for pictures and they have a wonderful gift shop and cafe on sight with reasonable prices.  All in all a great way to spend an afternoon in Ankara.
"Ataturk Mausoleum is truly the highlight of Ankara. Located on a hill in the center of the city, this piece of history provides one a good hike and look into Ankara of the past and into the life of Turkeys infamous leader Ataturk."
Atatürk’s Mausoleum is the best in the world. Museum part is extended for years. Very clean place and a lot of people visiting even in weekdays. Giftshop is very nice. Thank you our commander Atatürk for the existance. Ne mutlu Türküm diyene!
"Is 100% a must see, especially for the people from countries that were involved in WW1. You get a true understanding and appreciation to Turkey when you see what Atatürk has done for the country."
This is an amazing place to see if you are interested in history or modern day Turkey.  There are so many things to see here and has so many items on display.   Wear your walking shoes because there is a lot of walking to do if you want to see it all.   We went on a rainy day and early in the day and it was not to crowded.  By the time we are leaving it was getting a bit crowded. I would recommend planning on spending about 2 hours.   We don’t speak Turkish but still enjoyed the tour.  If you don’t speak or understand Turkish you might want to go on one of the paid tours.  As you are leaving there is a little cafe where you could get a snack and some tea
"In addition to the mausoleum, there are also museums with diverse collections. There were two antique bullet-proof cars that were beautifully maintained. Changing of the guards was interesting to see."
Very short for time we had to forgo the museum and head straight for the great hall. The hall is some 30 metres high with the walls faced with a variety of marbles and travertine limestones. The great man rests in a 40 ton sarcophagus made of a tiger striped Turkish marble. Light pours through a arched window. The upper arch of the window is furnished with a golden mosaic. The roof is lightly ornamented giving the overall impression of grand but restrained architecture. A fitting resting place for the great man. Pivoting around you are treated to a panoramic view of Ankara.
"Do not miss visiting this place. It is very close to the subway and it is very easy to find on the subway map since there is a drawing of it on the map in each train. It is absolutely magnificent and the view of the city from there is very beautiful, so do not forget your camera. I also advise you to take sun glasses for everyone since it is a vast area and the sun could be very annoying."
"This is a perfect place to go and pay respect to Ataturk, the modernizer and liberator of modern day Turkey. Set in beautiful grounds, clean and well visited, it has a happy yet slightly somber feel to the place. I love when there is the changing of the guard."
"Dedicated to the founder of modern Turkey, Atatürk, and independence war, this mausoleum is a must for anyone wishing to understand the heritage of Atatürk and its meaning to people still today. Remember to enter through the main gate, which gives you the right impression and dimensions of the monument. If you are lucky, you will be able to witness a ceremonial wreath deposition to the Atatürk's tomb. They are popular and take place very often by schools, alumnus, associations, etc."
