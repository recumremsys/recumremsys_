"Spent many wonderful days on this glorious beach in November 2019, will be returning in March 2020.. Try the Esco's Sunnmoon beach shack, you will not be dissapointed. Wonderful food there."
Stayed only 2 minutes away from this lovely sandy beach. Can walk for miles either side of Benaulim beach. Shacks and restaurants a plenty. Sea safe to get in and out off.
"Stayed two weeks at a resort about a kilometre away and walked down and back nearly every day.  White sand that squeaks between your toes, a beach that is cleaned regularly, no rubbish in the water and plenty of beach shack restaurants that put out free sun lounges and umbrellas and don't hassle you.  It's interesting watching the fishing boats coming and going and there are water sports for the more adventurous.  Great in the evening too.  Perfect for a walk and to watch the sunset.  Not a party beach - much more a family beach."
"Just spent a week there. Walked miles every day and tried a couple of places as a day relaxation.Beds comfort varies ,so is the service of people who will look after you for the day.We were very happy there.Good for families and people who seek rest and hassle free life, although there are a lot of sellers on the beach, but you can ignore them."
Benaulim is a lovely long stretch of beach and I spent one morning walking down to Varca and up to Colva. Not a great deal going on and in my view lacks a little soul. A few bars do Karaoke at night so if that’s not your thing then avoid at all costs. Best beach spot for the day for me was up nearer Colva where it was a bit quieter.  But then most of the beach is pretty quiet.Restaurants all much the same. Don’t think I’ll rush back on my next visit!
"My friend and I were staying in a resort hotel so thought it would be nice one day to see Benaulim beach. However, we were a little disappointed with the lack of atmosphere. The beach it’s self is nothing special and there are hardly any bars or restaurants around. Do not travel to Benaulim just for the beach."
Visited Benaulim Beach in the evening at 5 pm. The beach was clean. Has some snacks and drinks at Pedro shack.
"We had dinner at a shack 'Rogers' - excellent experience, good food and service. Try their Beef chilly, Pomfret fry, Non-veg Sizzlers"
"Visited Benaulim Beach during last week of Sept'18, it was a fascinating sight of clean beach with less noise levels. Eateries have breathtaking view of scenic beach. enjoyed with family for couple of hours"
Benalium beach is a nice beach.  Lesser crowd and orderly.  Calm a beach.  A relaxing place in SouthGoa.  Must visit.
"Very quiet and relaxing! Beautiful warm sea with good waves. Find the shack called ‘people’ for great food, service and my favourite beach dog..Dinner!"
"It is the best cleanest and longest beach, I have come across. Being not crowded, sun rise and sun set photography was par excellance and added to my son's birthday photoshoots. Recommended location."
"Our first beach in South Goa. Very long, we walked 2 hrs in each direction and didn’t touch a fraction of this section of coast.Some beach shacks still opened (late May).  Perfect for kids, huge stretch of white sand with very long shallow lead in to water. Gets a bit rough to swim in but waves looked like fun.  Toddlers would love the 10m or so lead up to waves (ankle deep) of damp sand with gentle water lapping it.  Lifeguards regularly placed.Dogs can be a bit of an issue. Single dogs I can ignore but when they packed I panicked. They tend to have their own ‘shack’ areas, so just keep walking and they eventually turn back."
"Nice quite clean white sand beach in South Goa. Medium-Low surf, shallow entry, so fairly kid-friendly. Plenty of beach shacks; they will let you park yourself/stuff on their chaise lounges with umbrellas if you buy drinks/food. Beach is safe at night to walk to/from beach shacks for dinner; lots of stray dogs, but they typically won't bother you. Ate at a number of shacks, pretty high quality throughout, best meals were at Joecons, Mahal, People, Blue Corner. Stayed at Beira Mar, which has good beach access and is close to Benaulim Beach Road, which you can take into the closest town (10-15 min. walk) that has shops for groceries, water, booze, food, ATMs (recommend Bank of Boroda, on main road, go to ATM on far right for Cirrus withdrawls). Handicrafts and jewellery were overpriced, so save your shopping for the big cities, if possible. Overall, this place best for a relaxed stay; if you want to party all night, go elsewhere."
Nice clean beach. Visited it on 21st December 2019. Less crowded nice and peaceful. Kids enjoyed the beach... had a nice dinner besides the sea. The most beautiful part was no hanky panky loud music soft live music was there and at the same time could enjoy the sound of waves at night a must visit till it gets more commercial and busy like baga and other beaches
"This was our first visit to the South of Goa, what a difference!!!Far nicer than Candolim, not so busy and the beach and sea much quieter. Loved every minute and will be going back!!!!"
Peaceful beach. Not crowded at all. Visited this place during January end. Cool breeze and decent shacks.
"Great food, caters for all with a very friendly staff. The walks along the beach are idyllic for a romantic stroll. Watch out for the dolphins and wild life."
plenty of room for everyone. great places to eat and drink.tried a new place everyday and all served great food. Hired bicycles for a whole day for around £4 for 2-what a bargain.Great to watch the fishermen come back in and help pull up the boats and watch the catch be unloaded.Lots of dogs but they didn't seem aggressive.
"Simply beautiful! With only two families on the beach the Benaulim beach is a great spot to enjoy the ocean (Arabian Sea). However, May to September are not the months to explore the ocean as Goa mostly sees higher tides and stronger winds. This thankfully does keep a lot of tourists away. Benaulim beach had 3 points of entry around the Trinity area. Entry 1: can be accessed from the southern tip. If you stand facing the ocean (which you won't really see - but imagine you are facing it) when at the trinity church, the road on your left will take you there. It is also easier to spot it as the Taj is located around there. There are no shacks, there no human in sight. Making it the most uninhabited spot. But due to the Taj, people do use the beach a lot from time to time.Entry 2: If you drive down directly via the trinity church, you will find the best spot to the beach. There are very few shacks, as a result very few or no tourists. Making it the best spot. Entry 3: If you go via, the Maria Hall, you get a few more shacks, along with Jauncy's, best known for its Goan and Sea food Cuisines. Don't ask for sandwiches and all, they will either take forever or keep getting it wrong."
"Silent beach, perfect for couples who want privacy. Explore beach beauty at early morning and late evening.You will found mostly fishermen and few local people for walk. You will also found lots of jellyfish at seashore."
"One of the best longest beaches in south Goa. Enjoyed the scenes Fishermen boats with their daily catch. So soothingbto the eyes. Long walks on clean beach for the entire week was a bonus with Boat,  Banana and Jet Sky rides at Pele's Sports"
"A pre-dawn, mostly street-lit, 2.5km walk on the paved roads between Benaulim Beach and Holy Trinity Church led to many encounters with packs of stray and set-loose dogs.   If walking alone, letting sleeping ones be, a walking stick and pepper spray helped to deter the dogs, while free-ranging cows, water buffaloes, and pigs were less aggressive when encountered.   Even small groups of walkers or runners seemed to have few difficulties.  Mosquito repellent was needed. Maria Hall and Kadar Supermarket are each roughly 1km from the Church and the Beach, respectively.   Produce, fresh fish, and ATMs are available at the Hall.   The Supermarket stocks most other necessities and close by are a chemist, the popular Hari’s German bakery/cafe, produce sellers, and a Kadar chicken shop. The holiday lights and decorations (photo of display across from Kadar supermarket attached) in Benaulim are plentiful and seemed more devotional and less commercial than in the West.  The 2.5 km walk can easily be extended another 15 minutes by continuing on in Benaulim to the also active and well attended St Sebastian’s."
"Lovely clean beach with life guards on duty, although not great to swim in due to strong currents and big waves. Not clear enough to snorkel. Great value for money beach shacks for food and cocktails. Lots of stray packs of dogs on the beach which can be quite intimidating. Witnessed a few people get attacked which was not nice. Lots of beach sellers that will constantly pester you every day until you buy from them."
"It’s such a lovely beach, loads better than Colva. Recommend walking away from the main entrance area to quieter shacks."
"Head for this beach to get away from north GOA hustle-bustle. The main beach is approachable via the Benaulim town. I shall suggest to visit an even more relaxing part of the beach which is close to Taj exotica hotel, Benaulim and can be accessed by a road besides the hotel. This part of the beach has few decent shacks (Joecons beach shack has amazing food!), fine sand and a flat beach. This experience shouldn’t be missed .. !! Happy travelling"
"Lovely peaceful beach, not commercial. Less people. Nice for some quite time and walk. The beach is pretty flat is good for nice dip in the water.The beach has some nice restaurant. Have eaten at Johncy. Has good food."
"lesser crowd than north guys.. South Goa rocks. Don't know why people head north, it is crowded dirty. visit benaulim"
Thank you benaulim for a beach so clean and proper. Except for a madman who was line fishing and barked like a dog the people are warm
Excellent clean beach. Most serene and beautiful beach of north goa. Little secluded though. Enjoyed with kids
"Look out for an amazing man called Shiva. He runs tours and gets involved in many other tourist activities. We did a cooking workshop at his house. It was such an interesting experience. Shiva speaks 20 languages, knows everything about world politics / sports etc. A very kind and genuine character who will make your stay memorable."
"Benaulim Beach is one of the best beaches in South Goa and it is uncrowded, maybe because we went during the monsoon.. Clean beach so hopefully travellers who visit this place, be responsible keep this clean as always. Collecting shells was my favorite part! Even brought some back as a memory to Ireland!"
Spending our days walking up and down the many beach shacks for food and amazing food made our trip one we will never forget. We came in late April so the beach is quieter than normal but in an evening that’s when it comes more to life with families playing in the sea or having a game of football. A fantastic place!!!
First of all about benaulim beach is very beautiful and clean with many different types of things including beachshakes with many different types of food and live music almost every evening. Surrounded with nature and hassle free.
"This beach is different from any other beach in GOA , neat & Clean , cool & calm. Enjoy the beach with family and friends. Even for couple it’s romantic beach."
