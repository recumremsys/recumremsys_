Visited yesterday. After doing the Territory Wildlife Park  it was good to have a nice refreshing swim. We started at the top pool and worked our way to the bottom pool. Well worth the visit and it was free.
"Enjoyed our visit here after travelling through Litchfield national park.  Was disappointed that we couldn’t swim as their was a sign advising against it, due to the water temperature and possible illness if you went swimming, which we didn’t want on a holiday.   The best bbq area and large spaces.  Would love to camp there"
This natural spring is an ideal place to spend a few hours having a swim and a picnic.  Great for all the family.  Check before going as it is a little way out of Darwin and sometimes closed.
Loved our half day at Berry Springs. Was a very hot day so relaxing the fresh waters was bliss. Glad we took our goggles as many fish to see. A great spot to take a picnic lunch.
Was well worth the trip from Darwin for a swim in the fresh water - I was happy to go in as I could see the bottom. Our visit coincided with a ranger talk and we got to hold a crocodile and learn how they keep the springs safe for swimmers.
"Drive out to berry spring for a relaxing swim and picnic with the family, they have great facilities and water is flowing. Check on the website before you leave as sometimes the place is closed"
"What a beautiful spot. Great for all ages. Very pretty and good facilities. Grass area to sit and have lunch. Take a noodle, fun to float down the river."
We walked along the rainforest trail then had a picnic lunch and a swim (wallow) in the stream. Wasn’t busy and lots of different swimming holes to explore.
Had a great time here last Saturday. Beautiful water to swim in and small waterfall to go under. Great facilities and nice kiosk with yummy homemade ice-cream.
"Went for a day trip from Darwin, very warm day so good for a swim and look around! Very refreshing! Lovely setting! Met some lovely people there to chat to as well! The falls are great to sit under very shallow so quite safe. Further down around river corner is deeper! Safe no crocs! Would recommend!"
A fantastic place to visit and cool off. There are a number of natural swimming holes  to choose from with variable depth. Take a pool noodle to help relax your swimming. $6 at the kiosk  or $2-3 from woolies. The grounds are well maintained with many BBQ s.The water is not as clear as the natural plunge pools in Litchfield NP.
This place is a “must see” & “must swim”. Buy some “noodles” for floating & reef shoes before leaving Darwin. Berry Springs is a magical place where you can migrate from one spot to another along the creek. The spring water ponds varying in size & depth & are easily accessible from the car park as paths have been created.
Nice fun spot for a picnic.  Loved the Crazy Acres Mango Icy Poles Yummy.  A good spot for locals to all get together not too far from Darwin.
This  is a magnificent spot to visit and depending on the season great for a dip or a lazy float on a tube.  Pack a picnic and enjoy the visit!  Please make sure you read all signage in regard to crocodiles as rangers do regular checks and warnings of sightings so bear that in mind!
We have had four visits to Berry Springs during our holiday.  Three waterholes that you can either swim down or use the clearly marked paths.  We preferred the lowest pool.  Noodles are a must.  Has both been very noisy and also quiet.  Just to be in the water supported by a noodle has been wonderful.
Relaxed place that is perfect for a swim on a hot darwin day. Good facilities and parking and is pretty popular for tourists and locals :)
Crystal clear water. Different spots to swim but all joined. Different depths too. Fantastic to spot fish in some areas. Take a mask to get a good look but you can easily see them just looking down. Lovely parkland with picnic tables and small kiosk with ice creams and pool noodles for sale or hire. Some areas are very deep so pool noodle great if not a strong swimmer.
Beautiful little water fall to visit and plenty of room to swim. You need to get there early to get a park as it was filled up by lunch time. The down side is people not moving out the way when you want to take a pic of the water fall. Wasn’t asking much there was only the 2 of them in there but they just didn’t care where has all the polite people gone.
… it turned out to be a big surprise.  What a lovely place well maintained with excellent amenities.  The water temp here is not as cold as the many other rock holes.  So make the most of it.  Bring along a picnic and stay all day!
A great park to visit plenty of seating and 'BBQs Easy access to water which is nice and warm. Crystal clear pools with some large fish. Do not miss.
Had an amazing morning at the springs!  Water crystal clear and a beautiful temperature.  Easy access what else could you ask for
Was too crowded when we got there. At the smaller pool. No place to buy food or drinks here as well. Would not really go out off place to do this. Probably a nice place for locals to chil. But clearly not one to be on the tourist map.
"What a beautiful place. Easy parking with a stroll down to a gorgeously pool. There were a few nerves with one eye on anything that moved but not enough to distract from the amazing surroundings. Quite easy to whittle away a few hours floating around, a nice escape from the heat. Watch out for the biting fish - they appear to love feet & legs ! It's a must do when in Darwin."
Was a really beautiful place. And lovely to go for a swim. We went during middle of the week and mid afternoon so wasn't too busy. Would definitely go back again. Also an easy walk for those who have difficulty with walking distances .
Hired a car for this short journey and what a treat. The water was amazing. Do not miss the mango pop from the kiosk.
"Paid a visit to this gorgeous free place in September. Not to busy and free to see. Three various rock pools to swim in, although I only swam in the small pool where I could see the bottom due to my fear of crocks. Bbq area, toilets and a little shop where you can purchase snacks etc. this place does have crock cages that are checked daily and is known for fresh water crocks so don’t be surprised if you see them in the pools. The water was warm and clear. I would suggest sand shoes that you can wear in the water to avoid the rocks, but a gorgeous place to visit."
"There are 3 pools to swim in, all natural. The top pool has a waterfall but is quite small, the middle pool is larger and the water temperature is perfect. Take a picnic lunch or enjoy a bbq in the grounds."
This spot has a warm water feed and plenty of areas for swimming.  Take goggles as there are plenty of fish to observe under the surface.
Went mid week so was much quieter than usual. Swimming holes and mini waterfall was so refreshing and clean. Great picnic area with electric bbq
"Great area, lots of tables for a picnic lunch. Shade areas to fit under, toilets, kiosk that hires flotation devices if you require as well as basic foods and drinks. Water is lovely and a few different areas for you to swim in. 45 minutes from Darwin"
"What a gorgeous idyllic place. Visited whilst in Darwin on holiday. The pools are warm, tropical and the area is well maintained. I would recommend to anyone visiting the far north."
I can’t believe this is free!Beautiful spot just to float around in clean clear natural surroundings & watch the wildlife.  I’d go during the week if you can as it gets very busy on a weekend.  Don’t forget to take your noodle!
"Berry Springs is a hot spring with various pools you can swim and float in. Start at the warmest - at the top, where there is a waterfall to massage your shoulders or go behind it to hide from everyone. Float down the spring (better to bring noodles or pool floats, underneath beautiful greenery to the second pool. Spend hours here swimming and talking to people and then float down to the final pool, where you can jump off trees or use the rope to swing into the water. Areas for lunch and a small kiosk. Just don't float further down stream because there may be the rogue freshie - though they don't bother you if you don't bother them."
"This was our second visit to Berry Springs so we knew to bring our $2 noodles that we purchased on Day 1 in Darwin. Berry Springs is warm enough to lounge around in for hours - hence the noodles (beats sitting on a submerged tree branch and gives you greater flexibility to float around the deeper parts of the pools).  There are a number of swimming options - shallow, waist height and who knows how far down it goes.  The best experience is in the deeper pools. You can buy noodles at the little cafe and possibly hire them as well but it is not cost effective, particularly if you are off to swim at Litchfield Park as well, where noodles are also a good way to stay in the water for longer. Bring a picnic lunch and something to sit on, and you could stay at the Springs all day. An easy 40 minute drive from the Darwin CBD means that you can go back two or even three times in a week to escape the heat and enjoy the beautiful natural surroundings here at the Springs. Make sure you investigate all of the pools."
"Being less than an hour from Darwin, makes this an extremely popular spot for families. There are lots of picnic areas and shady trees. The kiosk hires pool noodles as well as selling them. food is reasonably priced there too. BBQ's are clean.The pools look rather inviting and there is a small waterfall. I found it disappointing that people took bottles of beer into the pools as if one breaks people can be injured especially as the rocks make it slippery. The main and lower pools were fairly packed."
