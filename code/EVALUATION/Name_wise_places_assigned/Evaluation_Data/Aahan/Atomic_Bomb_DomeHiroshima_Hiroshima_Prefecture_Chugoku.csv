"The Atomic Bomb Dome is the ruin that remained after a nuclear bomb exploded, on August 6, 1945, The bomb exploded almost vertically 600m above the police station and the structure was able to withstand the almost vertical blast, everything else in the radius of approximately 1600m was erased. About 100,000 people died in the blast including everyone in that building.The Dome now stands as a memorial to this horrible event and is part of Hirshima Peace Park. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a place to visit and imagine what happened there. Don't miss the Museum that brings more background on the event. Remember that today nuclear weapons are orders of magnitude more potent than this ""tiny"" 15 kiloton bomb."
"This is the must iconic picture of Hiroshima. Last surviving building of the atomic bomb.  Much more impressive in real-life than pictures.  From Hiroshima train Station, easiest to get to by JR bus with takes you to main sights throughout the city.  Get on & off at your leisure. Three different color buses with slightly different routes but all stop at the Atomic Dome.  This bus is if you have the JR West region train pass or just purchase day pass at the station."
The atomic bomb dome is well preserved and a lot of information regarding the history of the actual atomic bomb (nothing about the history of WWII). It leaves visitors the clear message of the importance of peace and the devastation of war. It is an educational place. Requires time to absorb the history which should shape our minds.  A must do while in Hiroshima.
Go to this peace monument area to see the building which was one of some still standing after the atomic bomb detonated. It’s the last building and now a monument for peace.
Unbelievable to see that this building survived the bomb. A real must see if in Hiroshima.Near to the museum and other memorials. Looked simply stunning with the cherry blossoms.A poignant reminder of the devastation  unleashed in this town.Lest we forget.
"Given that most of Hiroshima was built in wood , the old exhibition hall has become an iconic landmark and testimony to the horrific destruction of the atomic bomb. Standing at the side of the ruin one can only imagine the horror of that day"
"Out of all the monuments in Hiroshima,  this building gives the best appreciation of the disaster that took place when the Atomic bomb sell a few hundred yards away from the building.  It remains untouched,  apart from help to make it safe. It marks the spot where 70000 people died in an instant. Let us never forget"
"Peace park is very tasteful and calm, the Dome is a stark reminder of what happened in 1945. Visiting on a sunny October day when travellers from around the world are mixing does help to demonstrate that we are all a community and are better together than divided"
"What a miracle this building is still standing, particularly since nearly everything around it was flattened by the bomb on 6 August 1945. The outside walls and the metal framing of the dome survived the blast that happened nearly directly above the site. If you are able to visit this site at 8.15am you get the opportunity to hear the memorial bells chiming. Walk further along the path leading to the museum and you come across other memorials like the children’s statue and the flame of remembrance."
"Now a world heritage site the former Exhibition Hall bore the full brunt of the A bomb, leaving just a shell. Walk around the Dome, cross the river and take a photo of it with the new commercial buildings in the background"
"Walking around Hiroshima, you'll pass the bomb dome frequently, and it's a reminder of history. It is fenced off, so you don't go through the building or learn much beyond some signs. But perhaps the point is it serving as a reminder, and it that way it serves well."
"Although partly destroyed, this building still maintains a dignified beauty somehow eternally resisting the horrors of the atomic bomb. Let it be a permanent symbol for all mankind to have peace forever ☮️"
Due to its tragic past this is a iconic shell of a building located right next to the memorial peace park. There are lots of good places to sit and reflect on what occurred here. Has to be seen to be fully appreciated
"Hiroshima is mostly known for its nuclear war related history and unfortunately not for the buzzing, cool city it today really is. People back home are still surprised when I tell them that Hiroshima is a safely visitable place and one definitely definitely worth it. Having mentioned its flourishing present times and surely great future, is it also important to remember the things that should not be repeated (anywhere in the world) and the atomic bomb dome is one of those symbols. It really is a quiet, yet captivating site  that can't and shouldn't be missed. Sadly famous, but still very much valuable as the memorial it serves as today."
Very interesting and amazing it’s still standing. Visited after the museum and peace park and the whole thing was well worth the crowds of tourists and school children.
"This remember anchor as a result of the A bom dropping on Hirosima is one of the most impressive existing icons of that event. Sitting on the othe site of the Motuyasakawa river, sitting on a bench with eyesite directly on that Dome building, one might contemplate on that event, what it did to the citizens of Hiroshima and the world as a whole, responsible for the blast.....you would wish that there will never ever happen such a thing ever....anymore..... but Nagasaki was there to be targeted...... days later....."
"I'd visited Hiroshima 10 years ago with work colleagues. Returning now with my family, the building still has the same power.Set near beautiful gardens, the A Bomb Domes stark skeleton cries out .A fitting reminder to the world of what happened to so many thousands of poor people. It must never happen again"
Definitely worth seeing. Surprised it was still left standing considering location so close to ground zero. The photos nearby showing the devastation certainly make you think about the hazards of nuclear war.
"Combined with a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum this is an iconic landmark that you must visit. I read on a sign that the government of the time had debated whether the ruins of the dome building should be demolished or preserved, and I'm so glad they chose the latter. It is a fabulous, albeit sobering, memorial to the terrible tragedy of the worlds first atomic bomb attack."
Combine your visit to the Atomic Bomb Dome with Peace Memorial Park. There are lots of signs around in English and Japanese to explain the history of the place.
"Incredible moving area of the Hiroshima which childrens peace park, and other monuments recognising the devastation of the atomic bomb in close proximity.  Do not go to Hiroshima without visiting.  Well documented"
I first visited Genbaku Dome in 2015 but it was scaffolded and covered up for restoration works. Now finally able to admire this magnificent building which somehow survived complete destruction despite almost directly underneath the explosion. Am glad I made the right decision as to whether to detour to Hiroshima on the way back to Kokura after a daytrip to Hagi.
"The captivated stares from my teenage kids’ eyes on the Atomic Bomb Dome spoke volumes as they tried to imagine the devastation of the atomic blast while at the same time, amused at how much of the building survived being so close to ground zero. Located along the bank of the serene Motoyasu River just across from the Peace Memorial Park, it’s the most conspicuous monument. No matter at what distance or angle you view the Dome, it’s a hauntingly captivating sight that can keep you spell bound. It’s free to visit and you can get up close to it."
Trying to imagine what happened and how it felt to survive and see this catastrophe... the dome the only surviving building ? Lots of reading with  history very good !
"The famous genbaku house became a symbol of world war II. It was left in ruins, as was the Kaiser Wilhelm Church in Berlin and the St. Nicholas Church in Hamburg. The former building of the Hiroshima chamber of Commerce and industry was designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel. Being only 200 meters from the epicenter of the explosion, the structure withstood the impact. The only building in the epicenter...Most of Hiroshima was made of wood and burned down. People who were in the epicenter of the explosion, instantly evaporated, enveloped in red-hot plasma, the temperature of which was about 4000 degrees Celsius. Powerful light radiation left only shadows on the walls of houses from human bodies. 9 of the 10 who were in the 800-meter zone from the epicenter of the explosion died instantly. The shock wave swept at a speed of 800 km/h, turning into debris all the buildings in a radius of 4 km, except for a few built with the increased seismic hazard. Letzel building withstood the shock wave thanks to the steel frame. It didn't just melt. As well as high-quality reinforced concrete. After the war, when the citizens of the city began to rebuild Hiroshima again, it was proposed to carry Genbaku. The anti-war movement of the 60s saved the memorial. Activists raised money to strengthen the structure, and collected half a million signatures in the 90's to make the house a world heritage site in 1996. The US government has actively opposed that, because It put Genbaku on a par with Auschwitz and perpetuated the problem of military expediency and compliance with the rules of warfare of the bombing of Hiroshima. The nuclear house continues to be a symbol-a warning to humanity about the catastrophic consequences of the use of nuclear weapons."
"Thd dome is located withi n the peace park or adjacent to it. All three major attatractions, dome, peace park and museum are located next to eacb other.Well worth visiting. No entry costs for the dome, park and 100y for the museum. Catch the JR tour bus at no charge if u have a JR Rail Pass."
"This is a must see, even if it is just a building and nothing to see. Brings home the whole history of the place."
"Taking time out from the Rugby World Cup we detoured to Hiroshima. The Atomic Bomb Dome and nearby Memorial Peace Park are a must if you’re in Japan. A reflective space with peace and forgiveness at its heart. The Dome is a ghostly reminder of the horror unleashed on Hiroshima by Col Paul Tibbets on 6thAugust 1945. 80,000 innocent lives incinerated instantly. A further 130,000 dying in the aftermath."
Check out the atomic bomb dome and go through the museum are very humbling experiences.  walking around the building and then seeing photos of what things look like before and after make you realize the scale of devastation in Hiroshima.
"It is so much bigger than one would believe from photos, it was a few stories tall.  sitting next to the river makes the dome easy to find walking in.  It is a short walk to all other sites associated 6 August 1945."
Be prepared to be moved or become emotional at this landmark because it represents the dawn of a time where humans could wipe out whole cities.  The area around the structure is a beautiful park and I highly recommend spending time reading each marker.
"Part of the Peace Park, this monument brings home the reality of Hiroshimas history. Visit the museum,  wander through the park and then walk to the Dome. Very well preserved and worth the visit"
Seeing the outcome of the bomb in a beautiful and peaceful setting give you pause to stop and think about the world we live in.  I was concerned about visiting as an American and now I think everyone should see this first hand
"The human race is stupid.  War and hatred thrive. This is a stark reminder that most people just want to live in a peaceful environment. This scene and scenes from the Nazi death camps shows what devastation war brings. This is a somber reminder of lives lost, especially children who have perished through no fault other than being at home or being the wrong religion. Unfortunately it still continues. Take your children and show them this place in the hope they will yearn for peace not twisted hatred imposed on them by governments or dictators. A must see"
Standing at this place it is hard to imagine the horror experienced. Unbelievable to think governments still look at possessing weapons that can deal this much destruction.
