Visiting here completes the whole story of why the Taj Mahal was built. Views from the fort are wonderful across to the TM. The grounds are very pleasant and supported by the local monkeys!! Very cheap to get in.
Beautiful red sandstone fort - terrific stonework and carvings. Take a guide who will tell you the stories associated with this fort and especially the imprisonment of Shah Jahan (the builder of the Taj Mahal) by his son in a tower overlooking the mausoleum for his wife. A terrific view of the Taj across the river.
"Spent the morning at the Agra Fort and was amazed at the history and beauty of the structure. The structure is well preserved, allowing you to walk around and explore.  It was interesting to explore the area where Shah Jahan was kept prisoner by his son.  Such a beautiful white marble area.Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. The fort is a walled city."
"Agra Fort gives you a nice glimpse into life of Mughal Kings & their way of living. The Meena Bazar, Deewan-a-aam or Deewan-a-khas inside it, help you understand how the life was around 400 years ago. Take help of a guide available there, so that you can understand the history associated the fort. Must visit after the TAJ MAHAL :-)"
"Usually overshadowed by the Taj Mahal, it is easy to forget that Agra has one of the finest Mughal forts in India. Walking through courtyard after courtyard of this palatial red-sandstone and marble fortress, your amazement grows as the scale of what was built here begins to sink in.Constructed along the bank of the Yamuna River. The fort was built primarily as a military structure, but Shah Jahan transformed it into a palace, and later it became his gilded prison for eight years after his son Aurangzeb seized power in 1658.Really interesting place, a must see!!"
"This is a delight!  The history alone is enough to blow your mind.  Built initially by the grandfather of Emperor Shah Jahan who built the Taj Mahal, renovated big time by the emperor who was later imprisoned for years in it by a 3rd son, in a room facing the Taj Mahal.  It is so exquisite with scalloped entrances and inlaid marble. Older sections are painted but easy to imagine in its glory.  One has to imagine how the river used to almost reach the fort but is now sadly much smaller."
"This is an enormous Mughal fort. Currently, only 20% is available to be toured, the rest is used by the Indian Army. The fort has a few different architectural styles and some really interesting stories. Make sure you have a guide. Most tourists visit the Taj Mahal in the morning and the Fort in the afternoon. If you visit the Fort in the morning, it is quite quiet and peaceful."
Listening to the tour guide about this place is fascinating. Makes for great movie piece. This place is fairly big and you need time to really enjoy what this place has to offer a visitor.
Take a guide as you will learn a lot more about the fort and history of the tai. The excursion with guide is about 75 minutes. A really good excursion.
Beautiful place to visit to see where the royal family (of the king who built the Taj Mahal) lived. Was under construction but nonetheless still had beautiful sites even after 400+ years. Again lots of tourists come here so expect crowds every time and everyday.
The Agra Fort is UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the finest Mughal forts in India. Built in the 11th century an era marked by invasions and battles. This red stone-fortified castle was also the site of India's rebellion of 1857. It is set among ancient gardens. Another MUST see!
"Visited the Fort late afternoon as the sun was setting.  A truly spectacular Fort with stunning views of the magnificent Taj Mahal in the distance across the banks of the Yamuna.One cannot help but be awestruck by the immense size of these Forts and how they were constructed in a time past when the only resources were sheer numbers of labourers with little or no machinery in contrast to what we now expect for any major construction project.A sight to behold and absorb the historic vibes from every step as you walk through the labyrinth of stairs, courtyards, arches, enclaves, gardens ..."
"The fort is a large palace complex, on its territory you will be met not only by the spirits of history, but also completely living chipmunks. Do not forget to take a treat for them!"
Absolutely Amazing! Went in November so the weather was perfect. Can even see the Taj Mahal from the fort.
"Visited this place back in December after arriving from Delhi. This fort/palace was once the residence of the Mughal Emperors, especially during the period when Agra was the capital of the empire. From the outside, it definitely looks like a fortress, something that can be said for many Mughal era palaces such as the Red Fort in Delhi and Fatehpur Sikri Fort. This was the first stop of the day on my tour around the city. It’s a great structure even after seeing the equally impressive Red Fort. The monumental Delhi Gate, Shish Mahal, the Muthamman Burj and Jahangir's Palace are some of the best things to see in the building. At the entrance to the fort were lots of guides offering their services. I didn’t use any of them and found it unnecessary."
"Enter across the once crocodile-occupied moat into the fort/palace complex, which is spacious with lovely gardens. This is where Shah Jahan was imprisoned in his white marble octagonal tower, with a view to his wife's mausoleum (the Taj Mahal) around a bend in the river. Take time to explore and understand the history of the buildings in the complex."
"I was looking forward to visiting this fort after researching before my visit and finding myself totally immersed in the Mughal dynasty and the great Emperor Akbar.  As I booked this holiday directly with an agent in India and arranged our itinerary, he had arranged a guide for our whole stay in Agra.Azar our guide pushed us to the front of the queue and proceeded to inform us of this fabulous fort, only 25% is available for viewing as the government uses the rest but it was worth the visit.   Magnificent architecture and clever planning, this fort was never attacked as it had a fort/moat full of alligators.  Shahjahan was imprisoned here by his son and we could see the Taj Mahal across the river. Don't miss it !"
Amazing to see the high level of engineering employed in the development of this interesting fort.   Be prepared for a long tour beginning with walk up an incline.  Highly recommended tour!
"The Agra Fort dates back to the 1500's and was the Capital of the Emperor Akbar. It's an imposing structure and well preserved to show the outer and inner areas.While the main attraction in Agra is certaily the Taj Mahal, the Fort is well worth a visit. Depending on your level of Interest you can wander the grounds on your own, or opt for one of the many guides offering their services for a more in-depth look."
The history behind the fort and that view is enough to make anyone’s heart ache.  Go here before the Taj Mahal for the first glimpse.  It’s worth it!
"My wife and I visited Agra Fort, after our visit to the Taj Mahal. Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty till 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. The Agra fort is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857 which caused the end of the British East India Company’s rule in India and led to a century of direct rule of India by Britain. Our tour coach dropped us off at the front entrance and we were escorted inside by a professional guide. A local guide can explain the history of the Fort to you, so it is a nice experience to have this knowledge at the site. Their were many Indian people viewing the Fort, even more than foreigners. The grounds are very photogenic, as are the distant views to the Taj Mahal. Looking at the photos on TA, it is hard to take a photo of something different, as we mostly have the same eye for beauty. There are plenty of stairs here, so wear comfortable shoes. A visit to this historical fort is highly recommended."
"HIghly recommend you see this fort before you see the Taj Mahal.  Definitely have a guide--either one you get at the fort or one you pay ahead of time.  If you arrange for one earlier, then they are able to assist with getting your tickets and showing you where you need to be to get the best pictures.  There are many, many great stories about this fort and if you take your time you will really begin to understand a little of the story that is woven into this location.  Not set up for wheelchairs very well as it is an ancient location and the ground is very uneven.  Outside the gates there are many, many street vendors who will follow you down the street trying to sell you trinkets.  Decide ahead of time if you want to purchase anything (some stuff is pretty cool!!) but be prepared to discuss the price!!  A guide will help you with getting good pictures and there are many, many spots to do that.  Take your time.  Don't rush."
A massive red sandstone fort standing high above the town. Inside a number of beautiful palace buildings lived in by the ruling family and their entourage. A large and attractive site - a little crowded in places. Beware of touts at entrance.
"Spent a couple of hours been shown around the fort by our guide Sakhander. Very interesting and very beautiful place and considering you only get to see 20% of it as the Indian army occupy the rest, quite large. Barter hard with your guide, never accept their first price."
The first standout on Agra Fort is that it is large and beautiful. Between the contrast of the white marble and the red sandstone it is an imposing building. Once you get through the fortification it opens up into vast courtyards and palaces that are splendid to observe. Bring walking shoes and water as it can be quite hot. Photographer Advice.- December (when we visited) can be quite foggy so don't bother trying to rush first thing in the morning. The haze will obscure many of your shots. I would wait till later and enjoy your breakfast while letting the sun burn off the haze. - The fort offers some unique challenges. You have a lot of wide angle shots and many up close shots. I did most of my shots with a 18-135mm lens and a cell phone panoramas.
"Sadly the Agra Fort and its palaces does not have huge write ups in guide books as everyone rushes to the Taj Mahal, but on the opposite bank of the river Yamuna, there is so much to see. Take your first view of the Taj from the palace where its builder Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son so that he could look to his wife's tomb each day! There are palaces, barracks and lots of monkeys."
"Went to Agra fort in Nov 2019. Really enjoyed the place. would recommend a guide it should not cost more than 200/- or 250/- rupees but bargain. Can get hot , carry a bottle of water ."
An interesting history of an important stronghold. Very well maintained. Allow several hours to take it all in.
"Looking from outside it's just a typical fort with massive walls but the red sandstone makes it striking. Inside is quite impressive with its incredible maze of walled courtyards, mosques and lavish private chambers reflecting the grandeur of the Mughal Empire. Peaking through the lattice windows that look out across the river to the Taj Mahal is amazing."
We visited Agra from Jaipur. It is roughly 220km by road. Visited Agra fort. It’s mesmerising!! Beautiful red stone structure with Mughal and Persian architecture.Information about different parts within the fort is missing. It would be advisable to read about the fort before visiting it. You will then enjoy it more!!
Do not confuse with the Red Fort at Dehli! The hard red sandstone is the only thing in common. This is a monument to the 16th century and architectural features abound. Look at the white marble parts inside and marvel at the amazing craftmanship.
A not to be missed tourist trail moment. Especially if you are a history buff. A glimpse into the old world and grandeur of India. Plenty of photo opportunities and lots to learn from local guides. Mind out for the hawkers.
"This huge, sprawling red sandstone fortress was once a royal palace. We visited near sunset, which was perfect--not so hot, not so many people, and beautiful light for pictures.  We wound our way up the hill on cobbled stone pathways, passing through huge red sandstone gates, and emerged at the top on a beautiful green lawn surrounded by fortifications.  From there we headed toward the “harem palace.”  Passing through yet another gate we found ourselves in a lovely Versailles-like garden with beautiful flowers—reds, orange, and green.  Located on three sides were the quarters for all of the women of the harem.  Continuing on up the stairs to higher platforms, we found the remains of a large swimming pool, and finally buildings of the former palace, including wedding chapels built for Jafar’s daughters and summer palaces for the royal family. From the chapel windows, views of the Taj Majal, the valley, and the river below were magnificent. Making our way back to more public areas of the fortress, we saw the Shah’s audience chamber—a large open-air building with many columns supporting the roof and an elaborately-carved balcony, from which the Shah would address his people.  Although some areas were in a state of partial disrepair, it was still amazing to see the remains of this incredible fortress.  Of course, the Taj Majal is the absolute must-see in Agra, but Agra Fort is also a site not to be missed if time permits."
Following our visit to Taj Mahal our guide took us to the Agra Fort. Again Arif was most knowledgeable and gave us a super tour ..It is important to visit the Fort in conjunction with the Taj to understand the history of it and what a wonderful place this is too see
"Imposing red sandstone walls and moat guard the royal residences of the Mughal Emperors, with the current external structure dating from the 16th century. Much of the interior structures are attributed to the rule of Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned here by his son from 1658 until his death in 1666. Historically and culturally significant."
