Another beautiful beach in North goa. Baga beach is very clean and big one.  is having water activity and i try speed boat there. They take you just 100meter but i really enjoyed this activity. Outside the beach a small market is there for tourists.
"One of the beautiful places in goa, spcially with your partners. Surrounding is soooooo romantic at time of sunset."
"One of the most popular beach üèù in Goa.Superb place enjoyed a lot. In day time beach looks awesome. It gives good feeling, and in night it more beautiful. Evening time is good to enjoy music and food. You can enjoy water sports also where many activities are available. Good quality of seafood- its amazing and very delicious food and mocktails. This place is for seafood lovers. There are many fresh fishes which you can choose from and they cook it as you say, in front of you.The sunset was awesome. Had a lot of memories here.It is good for families and couples. Must visit üëçüèª"
I went to Baga with great expectations and my memories of 2014 visit to this place. In 2014 this place was awesome despite being very commercial. It had a great deal of charm. If I had rated Baga after my 2014 visit then I would have given it a good 5 stars full.Alas my last visit here in March 2019 was a terrible experience. People from all parts of the world had gathered. It was bad. The crowd had some really rowdy folks who think they are cool if they are in a big group. Lot of eve teasing and terrible behavior by some people.Food joints are overpriced and so are the water sports activities. There are limitations to how deep you can enter the water and a lot of littering of plastic and bottles and other stuff. I seriously felt like I should have never visited the beach and should have just cherished the memories of the previous visit all life.Big time that visitors understand the importance of keeping the beach and its vicinity clean. I think government should charge people for entering the beach and imply heavy fines on littering. Let everyone understand the value of these tourist-friendly places as soon as possible.
"Baga beach is the busiest of one long sandy beach that stretches from Baga south for several miles. It‚Äôs a broad stretch of sand fronted by beach shacks where sun beds are free and the shack boys will keep you in cold beer and snacks all day for a few dollars. Various non aggressive vendors will offer to cut your nails, massage your shoulders, pluck your eye brows or clean out your ears for a couple of bucks. There are stray dogs and the odd cow. Take beach shoes because the trek to the sea is like walking on hot coals. There are breakers on the shoreline that can get a bit dodgy so be careful with young kids or if you have walking difficulties. Most Indians can‚Äôt swim and they like to frolic in the waves in their underpants or fully clothed. At night it can be quite magical with hundreds of candlelit tables set out in front of the shacks. Here the Indians will hit the alcohol, shine their lasers at passing aircraft, smoke hookahs and go beserk on the makeshift dance floors to insane Bollywood music. There are a few Europeans but the nouveau rich from Mumbai on three day party breaks come by the thousand. Thankfully Russian tourism has dropped to a trickle but their arrogance has been replaced by Russian drug mafia who have started bringing in Russian prostitutes. So Baga is no longer a hippie haven. It‚Äôs a Marmite town. You love it to bits or you hate the place. It‚Äôs brash, dirty and noisy. It‚Äôs the Blackpool of Mumbai. Personally, I love the place."
found baga beach to be lovely however same problem wit litter in surrounds. Also tends to get crowded with locals which one would expect being so close to a large town
"This is a Beautiful Beach, beside the Baga River, We love to stroll along it. stopping off at Beach Shacks for a cooling dring.."
"Bubbling with life Baga is one of the beaches where you stay up all night! The entire lane is always lit up with life. The sound of the crashing waves and your favourite drink, typically can spend a whole night if planning to pull an all nighter."
awesome place to hangout and one of the famous beach. they provide alcohol and hookah on the beach. Don't miss the nights in beaches and street of Goa.
Visited Baga beach for the first time. On the facade all seems well Clean and tidy until you venture to the rear then the usual Indian mess and rubbish appears Very sad a out that.Beach has life guards who whistle a lot but in the main are on their mobile phones most of rhe time.Tourist Police are about which is reassuring until you observe they are also on their mobiles!
"visited few other beaches - anjum , vagator , calangute . But none of them as lively as Baga. dont miss titos lane and bargains"
"Been going to his for last 8 yrs in a row, from house music to nowadays sapna choudhary playing in the shacks near Titos/ mambos we've come a long way. Not being judgemental here but the crowds have become more loud n liberal I would say so strict no for small children . Rest the food remains the same .Well i went in Jan avoid it cause  when you enter the water for swim you'd end up finding a lot of kingfishers ( especially strong)."
"This is most unclean and crowded beach in north goa. Avoid it if you want some peaceful time. But you can get cheaper water sports here,"
Crowded but nice beach. The shacks are good here for a nice relaxed time. Be there for sunset. Lot of water sports facility but remember to bargain.
"Went here yesterday as a change from calangute. From afar it is a must more visually satisfying place but walking around is such a letdown when you see all the rubbish and broken glass bottles thrown everywhere. If you have kids be especially careful, I cut my foot open on a glass shard buried in the sand."
The beach is quiet famous. It is crowded most of the time. You can enjoy good water sports at a decent price. Try bargaining a bit. Overall there are so many good shacks for food and relaxing. Beach side oil massage can be taken. The crowd is okay sorts. Overcrowded beach.
We went to this beach as it was local. Ate food on there which was nice. There were a lot of locals and very friendly. A little busy if you are looking for quiet this is not that. Had a massage on the beach which was lovely. A real good experience.
"Spent 2 nights on this beach - but only managed it with earplugs! Thumping basey music until 4am at least! Lots of bars and restaurants - clean in some parts not in others. This is India, nothing is very clean!"
"I have been visiting this beach for many years now and i have seen this beach go down the toilet gradually over the years. The problem as with many things is lack of governance - there are too many shacks next to each other and they play music so loud that the ambience of the beach is completely ruined. Add to that, bachelors drinking beer & chugging the bottles on the beach, you have a mix of dirty beach with loud blaring music which probably can only be enjoyed by very few. This is definitely no longer a destination for younger couples or families anymore. Save your time & visit one of the more nothern goa bbeaches"
Even when you visit there at midnight 4 Am it will be with the huge public. Want to enjoy till midnight you can visit this place and have some fun
Baga Beach is a nice area of Goa. The beach itself is beautiful. You can rent a bed and umbrella for the day for 200 rupees ( about $4.00 Cnd) a fellow watches over your bed to make sure your items are safe or adjust your umbrella if need be.The beach is sandy with a light surf. There are no rocks or seaweed or shells.... just sand. The water of the Indian Ocean is incredibly warm. You are able to order food and drinks from one of the nearby restaurants. Local women come by with fresh fruit to sell. We usually stayed right in front of Brittos restaurant. Enjoy!
Had a great time on Baga beach at Boscoe‚Äôs beach shack.  Friendly service great staff. Excellent food. Seafood second to none
"Overall nice beach,  can get very busy,  the shacks are quite nice to chill at and sunbathe.  The water is quite rough,  and the sunset is nice to enjoy with a beer.  Depending on what you want,  this is probably the busiest beach in North goa we've been to,  nice vibe and you don't get hassled as much as other places.  South goa is far far more chilled."
"Looks like this is the most happening beach in Goa. Its lined with shacks, pubs and restaurants. Go early if you want a beach bed for your self. However the beach closes almost soon after sunset due to security reasons but one can spend time in the shacks"
Frequented by many Domestic Indian Tourists who leave rubbish all over the beach. Always busy and there are better beaches further afield
Found this beach to be fairly dirty. Mainly water sports done here. If you are looking for beach front restaurants make your way to Calangute beach as there is not much on Baga.
"This is one of the good beaches located in South of Goa. It has facilities for water sports, public bath and toilets and multiple shacks along the coastline.  Few of the happening bars are located in this area. Be careful of pickpocketers.  Nice place to unwind and roam around."
"Take a walk down the beach until you find Bongos, It has great food, cold cold beer, free sunbeds, free WiFi and great service. Lots of the locals bother you on the beach for selfies with a white person, and they do get bothersome but Bongos staff keep them away. The lifeguards will shout for everybody to come back to the beach if the water is up to your waist, You can ignore them it is just for the Indian people as most can't swim and there are drownings every year. The lifeguards are worried that the Indian people will follow you out and get in trouble."
This beach was great!! Crowded but nothing else is amazing water sports n whole lot of Fun !!!Best place to hangout with friends and Family Bago to baga!! üòÜüòÜ
"Baga Beach is one of the most popular breaches in Goa, be it day time or night, it is always crowded. The long beach with numerous numbers of shacks at beach, makes it most frequented beach. Spotted several tourists enjoying sea bath. One can hire a reclining chair with umbrella and enjoy the sea view and food. The night scene was very noisy due to loud DJ music being played by the shacks for guests to drink and dance. Spotted numerous empty bottles thrown on the beach, a big eyesore, and that made the beach dirty too. While enjoying night view, we had our evening snacks with chicken chill dry and chicken steak at one of the Shacks. To summarize, most frequented and noisy beach"
"There are a lot of nice beaches in Goa. Don't waste your time at Baga beach. Its loud hindi music blaring from every shack, Loads of drunk people. Terrible place for foreigners and any and all women."
Goa tries its best to be clean but thats never gonna happen with free ranging cows at beaches & roads. Watch ur step.
Clean beach to have fun with the family or friends.Good spot for all the water sports. have shacks to relax at the beach.
"Baga is no longer a classy beach. It is dirty, full of third class crowd, too much noisy. Avoid it at any cost if you want a peaceful holiday."
A pleasant and hot location. A place where u can chill out without boundaries. Baga beach is the real reflection of Goa. Missing it particularly on weekend nights is missing Goa in real sense.
