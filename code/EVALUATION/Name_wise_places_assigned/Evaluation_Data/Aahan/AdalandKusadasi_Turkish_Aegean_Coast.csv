"Its very overpriced knowing that Turkish Nationals can pay different rates.  we nearly paid 100 e for a family of 4 which is a bit much in Turkey. you can try to get cheaper tickets from sales agents in town.      some slides didnt open till 1 pm, some queues are very slow- we were waiting for about 40 minutes for one of the biggest slide with a ring-- kidz were freezing while waiting. slide was totally crap- our ring got stuck in a middle around 20 meters from the ground. Try the park if you have money but dont bother if u are on a budget unless you can get cheap tickets. we tried as we wanted to compare it with other parks in Europe."
"Really very big aquapark. On the sun it's very difficult to go from one slide to another one on the ceramic floors.Do not go to Amazon slide - it's slow, not funny and too big line to it, we had to wait for 30 mins to go down it, but it wasn't worth it. We started from the loop blue - the scariest one, so all the rest were childish afterwards. Also great ""slide and fly"" slide, but be careful. Most of ppl hurt themselves during flight to the pool.Also there are some ""all inclusive hotels"" entertainments like dancing in the rain. Seems to be funny, but it starts during the hottest sun. Photos are extremely expensive and it's impossible to trade for better price even if you take a lot. For digital version they ask extra money. Didn't like the attitude of these sales guys at all."
"I visited as an excursion from Palm Wings resort in Didim which meant a 10am to 4pm stay in radiant, reliable August sunshine. I had 3 daughters with me aged 7, 9 and 11, all of whom thought the day was great. We headed for the key attraction initially, the Amazoon 'World's longest family slide' and waited an hour (mostly in shade) to get to top for about minute ride, which was fun but definitely not worth the wait. The rest of the day was a resounding success with numerous slides, tubes and pools which were great, we visited only about 50 per cent of them. Some of the rides are restricted: the amazing slide and fly is available only to aged 14 and over - I managed a gut wrenching belly flop from c 15ft in the air- not for the faint hearted! I saw no-one apart from adults/ older adolescents using the pink and blue 360degree loops. One tunnel restricted to minimum 150cm height and many had minimum 120cm height and these are variably enforced. However there is plenty for little children too. The safety of the rides was very good with single occupancy carefully checked. Be careful to secure your locker keys as I lost mine and it cost 5 lira each to recover. I also lost the dreaded payment card but got it reimbursed after producing receipts- staff were helpful in achieving this. In future I would load up this card from bank notes, not from debit or credit card as you cannot get any leftover currency back with latter. Unless of course you either know exactly what you're likely to spend OR leave enough time to spend the remaining card's credit. All in all this part of the experience felt a bit like a con which left a distasteful aftertaste in an overall brilliant day. I would give 9 out of 10 if I could. Just a reminder that you're not able to bring in drinks and food from outside, bags are checked for this."
"We went there on an organised day trip while we stayed in Didim/Altinkum. Have to say we really enjoyed it there, it was really really quiet there, I would say 150 people maximum in the whole park. Water slides were good, except that ski jump death slide thing (it really hurt when landing, my choice of language wasn’t the best HaHa). Food really good price even if it was fastfood, 2x burger, chips and can soft drink 64lira about £7 for 2. It filled a hole. Dolphin and Sea Lion show was great, pretty entertaining (although it was separate payment for it) it was worth it. It is great for the younger kids and small families, 2 separate fun pools with little slides etc.Lockers free of charge, small fee for safety deposit box. It’s a cash-less water park, you charge up a pre-payment card as you enter park and you use it as you would a debit card, when you leave when you finished in there, any un-spent money is returned to you when you give card back. We would recommend for a chill-out day and probably will return the next time that we are in Altinkum."
"We visited on a week day so there were no queues. There is a great selection of slides, some tame some terrifying but its great fun. The food was nice, and not too expensive. You aren't allowed to bring any food with you. It's a short taxi ride from Kasudasi city centre. Get there early to make the most of the day!!"
It is an aqua park north of kusadasiOver all it was clean an it was not too crowded. Properity is really big and have from very regular to very nice slides. Some slides have weight limits.By paying entrance fee u can use most of rides for unlimitted times . Dolphin park is devided by a door on left side of park and have a 20euro seperate fee. They have option of swiming with dolphines by 90euro extra fee too. By 10tl per 2person u can buy rafting tickets. Consider that it is very bad part of park. On my next visit even it was free i would not attend. By hearing of rafting i thought its like Antalya rafting but in Adaland it is with a cano which u shall paddle ur self. Its lazy hard and making u really tired.A dive pool is also beside rafting which was nice. Foods are available there. FYI Beer was 15tl. Donner was 23 tl. At all park has lots of stairs and makes u really tired . So try to sleep well the night before u are going to visit.It worth the visit for at least one time specially if ur hotels aqua park is small and u r looking for some adrenaline
"We visited here as a family group of 13 had had an enjoyable day out. Lots of choice of slides and a couple that are like nothing we have been on before!! The slide and fly was brilliant Fun, but did produce a few bruises when hitting the water! The tall yellow slide which 6 of us went in a raft for was brilliant if a little terrifying. My criticisms are as follows;Children over 10 pay adult price but were still unable to go on ALL of the rides due to height restrictions. In my opinion child price is because not all slides are available so if they consider 10 adult priced then all of that age should have access to every ride. We had a 10 year old in our group who was very disappointed he had to sit some rides out. Beware the floor is very very slippery! I myself slipped down a flight of steps and have some impressive bruising to show for it, wear your flip flops or beach shoes!!No comment on the dolphin show as we do not agree with these things, you pay extra once in the park, so we did not attend. We were very sad to see a parrot being paraded around for photos in temperatures of 38 in the direct sun for hours at a time. The children in our group were quite upset at his/her treatment. I think the practice of using animals like this should be banned."
Do not give this place your time or money they charge extra for tourists €24 or 124 lira when it's only 80 lira for Turkish people!! Their reason for this is that Turkish people are poor!! What a joke
"Had a fantastic day in adaland either sealions and dolphins!!!Fabulous show and excellent value for money, and you can have your own personal photo taken with the dolphins after the show!!!"
Loved everything at this aqua-park. You not gonna believe that it is the biggest aqua park in Europe until you visit it
"Great for teens - loads of slides and several pools. Big queues for tallest one but otherwise not at all crowded so short queues, plenty of sun beds and cafes. Dolphins are well cared for and swimming with the Dolphins was the highlight of our holiday. The trainers were great. Remember flip flops as the floor is burning hot. We got a taxi from main town for 10 Euros and he collected us at the end. Didn't get to do Dolphins until 5pm so bear in mind if you are cruising and have to be back on the boat. The communication about this was a bit limited which was the only negative."
Went here for the day in June 2017 as it was only located a short distance from our resort. Loved the slides everything looked clean and well maintained. The floor there was too hot to walk on especially as the heat was 34 degrees! My advice would be to wear flip flops etc when walking around.
"Great family day out & something for all ages, we visited beginning of season so there was no queues but some of the rides didn't open until the afternoon - I can imagine it becomes quite crowded July/August and quite difficult to get sun loungers! The place was very clean including toilet facilities and the park appeared to be well supervised - they operate a no cash system so when you arrive you can pay a 5ltr deposit for a plastic card which you load cash onto to purchase food & drinks at the end of the day if you return the card your deposit and any money not used is refunded! Only one food stall was open & it had very limited choice, but again this was due to it being beginning of season - drink fries & burger cost around 18ltr - saw signs for a vitamin bar & Waffle House which would of be been nice! Had a photographer on site randomly taking pics and offering more organised photo shoots - obviously another money making spin for the park but the pics came out nice and cost around 20ltr each (fiver gbp)! All in all was a good family day out - we booked through a vendor near our hotel and it worked out to be £16 per person which included pick up & drop off - grand daughter aged 3 was free."
My son really enjoyed swimming won dolphins . Think it's a bit overpriced considering that you swim in a group and you only get a few minutes with the dolphin to actually swim or touch . The show was good and staff very friendly .
"We were picked up from hotel, after breakfast and reached within half an hour, an attractive Aqua park , said to be the largest in Europe. . This multi storey park is full of greenery,scenic view and various swimming pools of Different depths. Special options for kids and teens are available. Rafting tunnel of 460 meter from the height of 40 meters is thrilling. Food and drinks are available within the Adalanda Aqua park of Kusadasi. Raining fountains with musical dance arrangements are there for an hour at midday, . This is amazing. One must not miss it if visit Kusadasi. One day 5-6 hours recreation in water world ,fun music and thrills is very enjoyable particularly in summer season."
We have been to adaland before as whole family it is quite good as far as water parks go very good slides and a big selection! Changing and showering room needs improvements.
very good long ride but worth it.trip was done on the first day so we booked with a rep arrived on time. no waiting day was good but it was the end of season and the park was shut just the dolphin show. had to pay ten lira to take photos and you couldn't really as they moved to quick.
"A fabulous day trip! Transfer from hotel took 10 mins, showers lockers provided no extra charge. Sunbed a plenty!!! So many slides of all shapes and sizes!! Dolphin show and a chance to swim with them at an extra charge😁"
"Went to the water park with family - a lot of fun but it's pretty pricey, even for Turkey. We went on a rather chilly/rainy day so there were no lines - the slides were great. One slide though I would not recommend - the double ramp slide that launches you into the air - fun, but I hurt my butt! On the whole is a fun day trip but could get very expensive very quickly depending on size of group, souvenirs, etc."
"Excellent! We went twice in August; first time afternoon spent mostly in Dolphin Park (2 kids swam with dolphins, a great experience!) second time in main waterpark. Clean and good water quality. Rides are excellent and staff helpful. WEAR FLIP FLOPS! Walking surfaces get very hot in sunshine. Downsides: There are no clocks anywhere to be seen despite some events being timed. Food is limited (but OK), and you cannot take your own. You may have to queue for rides without shade!"
Had a lovely day here. The thrill seeking rides are something else! You literally take off! The park is impeccably clean with lots of toilet facilities around. Good choice of restaurants and a cashless system in place so you can store money and valuables in the free locker. (Or pay for a safe)A lot of the rides have a height restriction of 1.2 but there are kids areas and family slides
"Travelling from Didim to Kusadasi was a long 2 hours' drive but once we got to Adaland Water park  it was well worth the trip!  The place was not too busy and it is very clean.  You need to put some money on the card to spend in the shops inside the water park (you can get a refund back if you don't use all in the card). Plenty of sun beds & pools nearby to chill with music on the background. No queues to go on all the water slides. The slides were good & suitable for all ages (obviously some slides have height limits).  Food choices were  limited but  good. No local Efes beer & all imported beer which was bit pricey.  Unfortunately the Dolphin area was closed during our visit. You have to pay extra for the Dolphin show.  Apart from that, it's a good water park and we had an absolutely amazing time.  The pictures from the official park photographers came out really good (mine was funny).  Make sure you pick one on the way out!  It could get busy in the summer!"
"Had to contact Adaland as we lost our photos from the dolphin swim, within a matter of hours staff had found my photo's and supplied a link for me to download them from, exceptional customer service over a year later. we have been a few times to Adaland and always enjoyed it but 2017 with Dennis(the dolphin) and the professional trainer will stay with us for the rest of our lives as a MOST MEMORABLE time! TY to ALL Adaland staff who have helped make my personal dream come true"
We visited Adaland for the dolphin show it was really good. We all enjoyed it. The dolphins and sea lions was really very clever. Was apparently the cheapest place to swim with the dolphins.If you have children it's worth the visit
price of entrance was 27$ in the gate but you can buy ticket 20$ in city . games was good but workers of there cant speek english and didnt care about visitors . lost my glass and they didnt let met to seek and also theire selft didnt seek to find it.also i expected at least towel or shampoo but ...
"Was a great place to take the children. Plenty of slides for all ages. My three children age 11, 7 and 21months had plenty to do. Would go again."
"The slides are very fun to do. A few a painful but still fun somehow. Didn't go to the dolphins or animal section, since I didn't want to support this section."
"Very disappointed with this park. I was already aware that you have to load money onto an ""adaland card"" but thought this was a great idea as they refund anything that you haven't spend and it saves you carrying soggy notes about. What the sales etc don't tell you is that they only refund cash so if you top it up with a debit , credit or even a post office currency card they don't return anything back to you. Surely if they have the means to debit the card they should also be able to credit the card too. It just stinks of a scam and they must be making a fortune by it. We had booked a trip which included transport. When we originally booked the trip we were told it was 6pm return but on the day when we were dropped of we were told it was 5pm. False advertising yet again. We were outside for 5pm waited around until 5:15 when we decided to contact our rep to see what was going on. At 5:45 we were finally told that the adaland driver had left at 5:05pm as we wasn't there. He needs to get his watch checked because we was there bang on 5pm but even so to only give you 5minutes grace is disgusting. The staff were really unhelpful and didn't want to know. Thank god for our rep Max from regal who went out of his way and organised us transport back to the hotel. If I were you I would save my money, the parks pretty naff so I'm not sure how they can keep a straight face whilst saying the number one water park in Europe so add to that the rude disinterested staff, the credit card scam and the fact they smoke everywhere even in the kids pools this has got to be the worst water park I have ever been too."
Half of park wasnt open so a little disappointing wasn't told this when we booked. Definately not a full day needed to visit. Was very clean
"We have visited here since 4 yrs ago and apart from one new slide nothing has changed and it has lost the “buzz” that you get from other European water parks.  We had 3 older teenagers with us who were soon bored of the tame slides apart from Slide & Fly - just be warned there is a high percentage that you will get hurt on this slide when you hit the water (yes it is amusing watching people slap the water with backs, faces, etc but not when it is you). The zip wire is permanent closed so just the 2 slides - be careful We booked tickets in UK so got them for £16 each (entrance only as we have a car). Do your homework as they charge more for tourists. Unless they add some more big rides then we won’t be going again. This is more suited for under 15s I would say. Get there early as it does get busy with long queues"
Had a brilliant time here with friends and partner. Slides are great had loads of fun. It wasn’t overly crowded which was good so didn’t have to wait long to go down slides. Lifeguards on every slide and pool which is good. Outside Zumba twice a day which u can join in with whilst getting  wet with jets of water  great fun. U  putmoney on a special card for your lunch and drinks so u don’t have to worry about carrying around cash. Over all a great day out for kids and big kids .
Visited mid August with my family. Free shuttle from hotel. Shuttles were busy so had to let 2 go before we could get on one. Queues at entrance but didn't have to wait too long. Internet sales queue was smaller and much cheaper to book direct rather than through a rep. We found out after it was half the price. Adaland is good fun. Things for all ages. Food and drink quite reasonably priced. Several times a day there is dancing under jets of water led by two staff up on a stage. Very popular. Lots of sunbeds available too. Would return.
Absolutely fantastic water park! The slides and facilities all to a high standard.. Good food for price.. Lots to do and see! Friendly staff.. Recommend a visit to anyone..
"Came here for the day during our holiday to Kusadasi. It wasn't too expensive to get in (about £21 for an adult). Changing rooms are basic but seem surprisingly clean which was good.The park itself is a good size with plenty of rides. You go down most on rubber rings with makes it more comfortable, and there is lots of choice from lazy, enjoyable ones to the full on adrenaline ones! The Hellslide is brilliant!I also went swimming with the dolphins which was well worth the money and a fantastic experience. The staff were mostly friendly and all in all it was a really fun day out!Top tip- don't go on the small yellow slide next to the almost identical one in orange. It has a sharp angle change near the bottom and it really hurt!"
"Watched the sea lion and dolphin show on 17th May, the show was great. I got a kiss off a sea lion and had a dance with a dolphin. The children had their picture taken with the dolphin and they loved it. Tip though it's far cheaper to get a taxi and pay on the door than to pay the excursion price"
