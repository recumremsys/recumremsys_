"This a a haven for nature lovers like myself. The lake is set amidst scenic surroundings and the road around the lake and other walkways built by the lake authorities are truly beautiful.The hotels inside the Lake boundaries are expensive. Spend a night at the many 'Pensions' (home stays) situated just outside the park boundaries. We stayed at Abant Pasa Pansiyon, which had a stream flowing in it backyard and out hosts were one of the most hospitable people that we have met in our lives. Walk around the lake and spend some time there to tune your senses to the sights and sounds of Mother Nature."
The lake is situated in park that you pay for entrance. Has all the facilities of comfort. Public toilets and benches.Greater view amd whether.There are a couple of hotels if wish.Must visit if you are in the area.Along the way from Bolu to the lake there are lots of great restaurants and locals selling their own home grown goodies.
"The place is stunning, the road to the lake is well maintained, good place to spend a day out, bbq places are available, there are many local restaurants on the road, some view activites like ride a hourse or a hourse  carrige to show around the lake. Such a nice spot to relax and meditation!  Come early to find you best spot to set. Bring some warm cloth, even in summer the rain or cold breeze nay surprise you. The restaurants on the lake has nice view. , bit pricy but some of the staff speak English and accept credit cards for payments."
A lake from dreams in the middle of forest. Amazing views. Has a few good hotels around. Cold weather in the hottest days of summer.
"It’s quite a joy for nature lovers to be able to enjoy such large lake. What define Abant are the services & facilities all around. When you reach the lake edge by car you can BBQ, enjoy a horse ride (10 minutes for 10 TL) or even breathe clean air. We know it was hot that day but everybody else in the northern hemisphere was complaining about a heat wave. We spent 2 hours before the sunset staring at the serenity nature provides. As a photographer; I advise everybody to visit right after sunrise or before sunset.If you got only one chance to visit a lake in Bolu go to Golcuk. Abant is about 25Km from Bolu center while Golcuk is just outside the city center. Both lakes have about 8 KM well maintained roads. On your way back you can stop by the road side villagers selling some of their produce of Honey & Jam. Some also sell village butter, eggs & bread. You are taking your chances with these sellers because of the nature of their goods. Pass by several before buying & you will be able to tell what’s what."
"Perfectly situated between Istanbul and Ankara this is a perfect retreat to enjoy natural environments. Located in a reserved forest, the lake is circled with many picnic areas, walk/bicycle paths, hotels, restaurants and horse rides. Great for families and this on a budget as well, for either a day trip or overnight."
"A very nice and big nature park. There are plenty of nice cafes and places to have some really nice kebab (I was craving some kuzu şiş that day and left very pleased). Beware though, they can be kind of pricy (especially by Turkish standards).There are a lot of picnic areas if you want to cook your own meat. You can also go horseback riding in the open fields (though I did not try these myself). There is a nice farmer's market and also a little cottage that sells more officially packaged food. I bought some great cheese here!A nice choice if you want to take a walk (or bike) around the lake or drink some tea while looking at some nice scenery."
Was the most popular and visited places in the country. Now it turned out that Arabic people and migrants now fulled the place. Not attractive for the travellers who have forestry in own-land but for Treeless country travellers.
Visited after 20 years. Dissapointed. Nothing is like in my memory. Golcuk Lake was much more better and natural even its artificial. Full of arabic tourists may explain why prices are so high.
Make sure to hike in the forest and discover the nearby highlands. Look for the watch point sign that will take you to a beautiful highland place.
Loved the horse ride around the lake (although the horses smelt baaaaaaaad!) There was plenty to do around the lake including tobogganing! There are two lovely hotels on the lakeside.
"Liked : All areas are very clean, preserved, natural and kept well. Disliked : Dogs should be taken under control. Horse droppings smells worse."
"It was January, which was winter in Turkey. Cold! Cold morning!The road leading to Lake Abant was covered with white snow. Beautiful calm lake surrounded by mountains. There's little people wandering around. Really quiet and peaceful on this little countryside town of Bolu.Seen some children playing with snow. All the beauty of this Lake Abant absorbed into my eyes so quickly. Spectacular!Enjoyed. Should visit if happened to stopover Bolu."
