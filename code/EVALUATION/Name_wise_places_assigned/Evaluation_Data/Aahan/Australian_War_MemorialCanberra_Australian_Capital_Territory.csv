"Very very well done. Visited once before about 30 years ago. Many exhibits, wonderful history. Extremely moving. Staff very helpful. Saw the change of guard. Poppys Cafe on site is good value and nice food"
Can see why has the reputation and everyone says to go.  Is in a beautiful location and displays are magnificent.Easy parking.  Cafes on site (but did not go).I am not a war buff but still did 3 hours there.  If you were a war buff you would be there all day and returning...........
Memorial and Museum really worth a visit! Beautiful building (and place) to honor those who went to battle! I really like to visit this place! Going to Canberra?.... a must!
Allow plenty of time to visit. A must see if visiting Canberra.Wear comfortable shoes and clothes and great place to visit on a hot Canberra day.
A great place to visit. Very interesting and informative. Go later in the day and you can see the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the last post.
Visited here with my kids for the first time in over 25 years. This place is remarkable and well presented. Its a must do if visiting the area and is free of charge.
"had not been to the museum for 20 years and the changes have been awesome. well organised, plenty of guides and tours - you can spend a whole day here - the light, visual displays happening every 1/2 hour are terrific."
"You simply must not miss the Australian War Memorial. Beautiful grounds, loads of displays and some great demonstrations. Take a guided tour it is very moving."
We visited over two days. So much to take in. The displays are well set out and really superb. At the end of the first day we stayed on for the Last Post ceremony. Very moving. Don’t miss the statue of the dog handler and his dog on the way to Poppies cafe. Having seen the happy photo of them together in the memorial building it was gut wrenching to know that an IED had ended their lives.
This museum is a must to see for everyone.  So well presented and informative.  Makes you think about the brave people who were in a war.
"Took a free 90 minute tour, showing highlights of this museum.  Well worthwhile as it is a huge museum and a bit overwelming..  Unguided, it would be difficult to know where to start.  Very moving experience.  You could easily spend a whole day here."
"Went in school holidays, could barely move in parts but good to visit. well presented and free of charge, would be good to have a one page map."
Walked into the war memorial just in time for a tour. Our guide was excellent -very knowledgeable and spoke well. He showed us the highlights and explained the scenario with some anecdotes as well. Really good and well worth joining in.
"Get there a little early as there are many people.  Very moving ceremony so be prepared with a tissue, it will bring tears to your eyes.  A visit to the AWM is a must when you are in Canberra  The ceremony starts at approximately 5 p.m.  This small ceremony is for everyone."
Haven't been to the War Memorial for over 15 years.  It was a very good display about the men and women who sacrificed everything so we have a wonderful country today.  Worth staying for the last post at the end of the day - very moving.The Landing Cafe - very disappointing though.  Coffee was nice but dirty tables.
We visit each time we are in Canberra. The last post ceremony is a must and very moving. Allow yourself at least 3 hours...sooo much to see and you won't be disappointed.
"Great set up, got to enjoy about half of it before my kids got too annoying. Very modern museum with interactive displays giving you more detail than normal on the pieces. Be sure to book in advance noting that there are seperate bookings required for the 2 different parts of the museum.…"
"This is a sobering place to visit as so much we take for granted is due to the sacrifice of many young men and women in the past.The work done on displays and provision of information is outstanding. The security on the building is good. It has a cafe for a cuppa and reflection. Allow yourself 3-4 hours to do it justice. The Long March was a sad event especially when you see the faces of all the young people who were forced into it. Excellent and a must see in Canberra. Last post is sounded 4.55pm. Opens at 10am. Get there by bus, taxi or uber. It's a long walk from the Mall."
"Arrived in the morning requiring breakfast. We ate at Poppy's which is attached on the site. Food was excellent and reasonably priced.Museum has undergone many changes since my last visit approx. 10 years ago and if someone says I saw that some time ago, then they need to go again. Displays have been updated and extended. Employees are very friendly and helpful. We spent around 2 hours there due to time constraints but could easily fill the whole day in there. Plenty of underground parking. I have been there a number of times over the years and always thoroughly enjoy my visit"
"This is both a memorial and topnotch museum set in a lovely location. The guided tour was 90 minutes and simply excellent. Moving stories of long lost soldiers and sailors who gave their lives in service of their country were recounted by the guide. Beautiful dioramas, exhibits…"
What an excellent display of Australian involvement in war. Tasteful exhibits that are extensive. A great educational place to visit. Make sure you leave lots of time to visit. There is so much to see!
Went into areas would not normally have found. Guide told the life stories of various people as we went round bringing the place to life.
Enjoyed a very nice afternoon here on a guided tour. Very moving experience and so much to see. Easily recommend visiting
"Allow plenty of time to look around so many interactive things to do and see. So well covered in all the conflicts, real size planes and tanks. You can take a tour or go alone at your pace. We did the tour and then went back to the favorites afterwards."
"Absolutely loved this place.  Went on the free tour.  If you go to Canberra, this is a must do.  The exhibits were educational and heart wrenching.  The exhibits on the recent wars were heart warming as it showed our four legged friends as well.  The kids enjoyed that particular exhibit.  Kids also enjoyed the discovery centre where they got to wear uniforms and sit in a real helicopter.  Could of spent the whole day and more here looking at all the exhibits."
"Wonderful, very emotional and informative depiction of  Australia in various conflicts.  We were there for over 8 hours over 2 days and still ran out of time.  Be prepared to be emotional and angry (at what humans can do to each other).  A definite must do in Canberra."
"On holiday form the UK and spending time with family in Canberra. Very moving experience - lots to see and digest in a very calm, serene setting. Moving displays as well as educational. Could have spent much longer here. Well thought out and designed. Certainly worth a visit Cafe good also ............................................................."
"Wonderful displays of wars Australians have been involved in, peace keeping and current Afghanistan deployment. Starting outside to see the Bushmaster our troops travel in. Statues including of course Simpson and his Donkey. The names of all soldiers killed surrounding the pool of remembrance a reminder of the number of lives impacted by war. There are tours throughout the day or you can wander the displays at your own leisure. There are plenty of staff on hand for information and directions. Stay for the 5pm Last Post ceremony where details of a soldier, and how that soldier died in war,  are read to the gathered crowd. A fitting end to a day spent at the Memorial."
Did a tour of the Memorial with excellent commentary by Jeff.  So interesting to listen to.  Stayed for the last post.  Spent about 6 hours there which included a wonderful lunch on the deck outside.
"What a nice surprise! Didn't realise what an amazing place this is. Spent about 5 hours here, immersed in history. Aircraft were amazing!"
"Went here for a visit last weekend, I like coming back here because of all the history of the wars the Aussie were involved in. Looks like a lot of thought went into the displays about how it was like on the Battle fields plus all the other displays they have set up through the museum. And the cafe is good for a bit of relaxation since they have 2 one inside the other outside."
"Very moving service. Needed more time, so much to see in the museum. The guided tour by the volunteer was very slow and laboured which impacted on the time left to see other sections of the museum. Will have to travel back Canberra in the future."
"Such a great place to visit. Take your family, friends or come by yourself and be amazed by the great sacrifice of our fallen heroes. I could easily spend hours here. There is plenty of parking and things to see."
Free entry. One of the best exhibits in Australia with various original piece's of war time items from firearms to fighter planes. The lighting shows are interesting to watch. Definitely stay for the 4.55pm Last Post Ceremony where they share the story of one of the names on the Roll of Honor. Allowed three hours for visit but could easily spend a day. We did a 1.5hr tour with tour guide Neil who was friendly and knowledge with interesting stories and facts.
"My husband and I did a day trip to Canberra and spent just over 2 hours here. Was absolutely worth it, would be great for families and larger groups aswell. Would absolutely come back!"
