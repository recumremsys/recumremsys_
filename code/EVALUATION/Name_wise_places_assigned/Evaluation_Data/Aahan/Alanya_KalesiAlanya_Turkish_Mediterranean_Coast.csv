"The castle can be seen from anywhere in Alanya, so this place is a must to visit when staying in Alanya. Be warned that it's really warm here on a hot summer-day. Be sure to see the small museums there too. The view over the city is absolutely fantastic."
"I spend a few hours visiting the the Alanya Castle and i like the site and the view of the city from the top. I also recommend to take an one hour bout trip around the peninsula and have a look of it from the sea. If you like history, a few hours spend at the castle will be a nice break in a hot summer day. Try do to it at the sunset!"
Catch the dolmus or lift up but a great walk down spectacular views.not much inside the castle walls but plenty to see on the way down. A visit to the boat caves is amazing but be warned rocky under foot and lots of steps.
Absolute must if visiting Alanya. Has some fantastic views from the castle. It cost us 15lira each to go in. We caught the local bus up to the castle cost 2.5lira each and walked back down stopping off for refreshments in the bar/restaurants who also have fantastic views over Alanya.
"Nice day trip to Castle. Sit in the castle and enjoy some amazing views of Alanya. Cable cart from Cleopatra Beach (Nr Damlatas Cave). Or local Bus. If your up to it you can walk to the top. Follow road from Cleopatra Beach, steep stairs that follow cable cart route leading to rugged path takes you to cable cart station on top."
The trip up the mountain is fun and you see this little village all the way up with small shops. If you go there to watch the sunset you will not be disappointed...the view from the top is absolutely spectacular. Be there around 18.30 if you want to make sure to catch the sun go down :-)
"get a taxi to top is the best way to get there, the views looking across Alanya is beautiful. The walk down is nice."
"An incredible historical place, which one must visit! Starting from the Red Tower near the port of Alanya, visit the old shipyard and thereafter make sure to visit also the top of the castle!"
"Yeah so the views are nice when you get there but they're actually much better on the way up. We paid for a taxi to take us there as we heard it was the must see attraction. It definitely was not. The highlight of the ""castle"" was a cat and a couple of butterflies. Otherwise it's just some bricks and no information anywhere about anything vaguely relating to the castle. Don't waste your time and stop half way up for the views - visit the red tower instead for some history"
"Wonderful place to visit, perfect view from the top to the city. Driving through the narrow roads adds some adrenaline."
"stunning views of alanya. don't walk up! take a a taxi, bus or the new cable car to the castle (cable car accent is not suitable for wheelchair users as there is a climb after getting off) the castle is being made more wheelchair accessible inside"
"If you visit Alanya, you can´t miss Alanya Castle, Kale. It is ancient place for pirates and view is amazing. You can see whole Alanya and take unforgottable photos. Better not walk there, walking in hot day will be hard. Take a taxi or cheaper way is go with Dolmus bus.On the way is an excellent reataurant, Panorama. Food is so good with great view to Alanya."
"The walk to Kale Hill Top is nice hike. Make sure that you have good shoes and water with you. There are numerous mini markets / restaurants and cafe's so it is rather easy to refill your water reserves. Must admit that this needs some earlier exercise and the 30+ centigrades with sun shine is not making it any easier, but worth it."
Take the cable car from the prom. Thought it would be a castle visit but there is a whole village up there to wander. Few eateries and plenty of history. You could spend a day up there
"bus takes you up to top. firstly went to view point and learned a bit of castles history, next to a local family house in castle grounds to see how the locals would have lived. saw a old loom and learned how the ladies used to make silk and given a demo. Oppertunity to buy silk scarves. Then given a bit of history on the oldest mosque within castle walls , and able to go inside {ladies given skirts and scarves to cover up and everyone removes shoes }.Stop made at small gift shop for freshly squeezed orange /pomegrannet juice and home crafts"
"Some restaurants or travel agencies make even free trips here, or low cost. Try to go there also during sunset, it's absolutely AMAZING."
"Nice historical side of the Alayna town. Better to go up in a taxi, it is exhausting to walk there in the summer heat. Split the cab for 5 lira per person (20 total). Also an interesting graveyard up there."
Go with teleferik and walk to the harbour by the main road and stairs. Nice views and good walking stairs in the hill.
Just so much to see. The walls many of them accessible- with care! Are apparently over 6.5km long. Loads of unadvertised nooks and crannies Byzantine churches. Abandoned towers could spend months exploring
"Visited the castle today and I think I preferred the view from afar.The gondola ride was probably my highlight, all else was a little overrated. The views were nice but would’ve been better without the smog... the castle walkways are pretty dangerous, please wear suitable shoes not sliders as these will not do when walking on metal scaffolding.Also note that the gondola ride up is about 50 TL (2 pax) but if you want to visit the castle right at the top then be prepared to fork out another 50 TL (2 pax).My free view of bodrum was a better one..."
"You can imagine the history as you walk around. Traitors gate, the wells, lovers cave. The views are outstanding. A must visit. Use the new cable car or take a dolmus."
Grear views on way up. Walk around the tiers and castle fab. Bought fabulous nut lights hand made by a lovely gent near the castle. Excellent prices and all different.  Looked around the mosque as non Muslims it was lovely to see and hear the story of the mosque. All the store holders were friendly.  Lots of steps though and quite rocky at parts but we'll worth a visit.xx
If you are in Alanya you just must visit this. It's beautiful and you can't regret it. I have been up every time I went to Alanya it never gets bored. Love to go in evening times when the sun sets. do check if it's still open
"View is great! Intresting place, nice to go there because of view... Dont go if its too hot during the day..."
"The locals told us to visit in the evening, that is was beautiful at sunset but also cooler. With temps hitting 40c every day you couldn't cope anyway.We paid 20 euros for a taxi to take us up the mountain to the castle, wait for us, stop on the way down for photos and then take us back to the hotel. Well worth it.You will be better of in trainers and the paths are obviously ancient and rocky.Lots of stunning views across the mountains and the beach. Lots of graves scattered around from the same family which was pretty.We walked around the outside falling the castle wall around the mountain. Take lots of water"
"I loved this place! Got a taxi up to the top from the town in the morning, it's a ruins at the very top of the out cropping. A Few Lire entry (Around £2 at the time) and your free to have wander around. The views are stunning from the top.A Small shop and coffee place near the entrance with a handy taxi-rank adjacent."
"A reasonably well preserved and large fortification on top of the hill dominating pretty much the whole beachfront of Alanya. Definitely a worthwhile experience to spare time for when you are in Alanya. Signs of several different civilizations and repairs and rebuilds over the centuries is very visible in the walls and buildings of this ancient port citadel. The walls are in a pretty good state but most of the old buildings inside are mostly ruins under renovation with an Ottoman Mosque and a good number of more recent buildings are still intact and accommodate a small number of locals who still live there in the citadel. While there is a road all the way to the top of the hill into the citadel and the castle together with frequent bus and minbus services to take you to the site from the port/Marina side, a more recently constructed cable car takes you up to the citadel quite fast from the Cleopatra Beach and Damlataş Cave side of the hill. Being so close together, while visiting the citadel, it's probably not such a bad idea to reserve time for a visit to the picturesque Damlataş Cave as well. And finally a few small shops and restaurants atthe top but my recommendation is to suppress your hunger, you can have a very rich Turkish breakfast either on your way up in the morning or a nice lunch or dinner on your way down later at the Muhtar'ın Yeri (the village administrator's place). Don't forget to take plenty of water with you especially if you are going up quite early before the small shops in the castle open as the sun is pretty intense up there on the rough stone cobbled pathways."
"very nice view, expecially at night. Try night safari to see all beauty of the Alanya town and castle."
"Go with cable car, it was awesome overlooking ocean from the top. Have many places to roam around, can easily spend 1-3 hours. Cable car is the best way to go up and down."
"Having an apartment just outside Alanya, we very often explore Alanya's surroundings and one of them is the Castle. A walk up and down the castle in a slow pace with a break will take you approx. 3 hours, but it's all worth it with the fantastic view, small restaurants where you can stop for a cold drik or a turkish tea. Make sure to take the small paths and NOT the road when you walk downwards again, that will take you though the local area of the castle, with some of the very old houses."
"The first thing I noticed was the hill Alanya sat on, it was huge. We found the road going up and started on our hike. PLEASE BE CAREFUL, this is where we encountered a man who said he new a short cut. This is not a short cut!!!!The views going up are amazing. You can see the whole of Alanya, new town and old. On the way up there are restaurants where you can stop for drinks etc. Nearer the top it leads you through the Citadel, here are people selling their wares. Once your at the top, it cost is 15tl each to get in. This is worth it for the views alone! I'd probably suggest using the bus to get to the top if you have children. However this only seemed to run hourly. We did it on a cool day and I looked pretty ruined by the time I was at the top...! The castle itself was having restoration work done on, so would love to return in a few years and see the difference."
"The main part of the castle which is part of an old fortified town is at the top of a steep winding road (3.5km / 2.25 miles) with no side rails on a peninsula. Expect to do most of the journey in second gear and try not to get stuck behind one of the town buses which is another way of getting there.Once you get to the top, the main castle area is actually fairly small and can be walked quickly but offers the chance of some spectacular views. This is an unusual attraction in that the remaining structures are spread around the top of the peninsula and is reached by following signs along paths or the main road you came up. The signs are not particularly good so how you get to the other parts of the will be partially due to luck but adds to the interest.On the way, up you will have passed through a gateway on a sharp hairpin with the remains of a small church nearby. Just below and behind the café is also a good start point to walk along a long stretch of the wall around the peninsula. Note that the wall is only about knee high to the walkway with a long drop the other side and is not part of the official attraction. The wall extends up to the lighthouse about 4 turns from the top carpark. At the lighthouse, there is a cobbled pathway at the top with bollards to stop errant drivers that becomes dirt track as you head towards the gateway that offers good views of the eastern side of the town.Note: If you went to the cave at the bottom, they will charge you again for a different car park. You can't use the same ticket. If you are coming by car and are planning to visit other historical attractions in the area, consider buying a museum card - it will pay for itself in 3-4 visits. Note you can only visit each one once."
"You can take the cable car or you can go there by car. At the top, you will find a well preserved historical castle with beatiful panoromic view of Alanya. The castle and the area around is really large. There are beatiful paths for walk and discover. Choose comfortable shoes and take some water. You will probably spend a few hours there."
"We went here on an organised trip through Thomas Cook. The road up to the ""Castle"" is very thin and windy. We were going up to it about 9.30am so never met any busses coming down. When we got to the top at the castle. Our guide took us in and pointed out a couple of things then left us to roam. I now know he did this because there appeared to be nothing more he could say. Part of the castle was open and had a good view down to the surrounding area but that it where the Attraction stopped. Most areas were fenced off and falling to pieces, there was only walkways round half of this small site, there was little shade and absolutely nothing that could be listed as an attraction. There were no indoor sections or evidence that anyone had ever lived here. It really is only some poor quality walls on a hill. On the trip down the hill we met a couple of coaches which were coming up but our guide said ""We're  lucky"" because it can sometimes take an hour to get down the road instead of 10 mins. This is not an Attraction. Avoid!!"
"Visited Sep 2017The castle is situated on a peninsula in Alanya. It stands high above the town.There are a number of ways to reach the castle. I made the mistake of getting a taxi at the bottom of the road. If you are of a nervous disposition, keep your eyes closed. Our driver was quite reckless. On some parts of the road there are no walls or safety barriers.  Took about 10 mins to reach the summit. Cost 30 TL about £7.50 / 8 euros. Very expensive, I suppose this was the tourist rate. The second way is to use the cable car. This takes you about 2/3rds of the way up. You will have to walk the rest of the way to the summit. This is quite a steep walk in some areas. Cost for a return ticket is 18 TL. Cable car runs until 11pm. The third way is to walk. I would advise against this unless you are extremely fit. It is a steep climb and for the most part there are no footpaths. There is little shade and day time temps in the summer can reach as high as 40 degrees +.  You are looking at around 2hrs to get to the top, take plenty of water. There are a number of small cafes en route.At the castle. Entrance is 15 TL. There is not much of the castle left now. Very disappointing, not much to see except lots of tourists taking selfies from the ramparts However, the views over Cleopatra beach and the harbour area are quite stunning. Decided to walk down back into the main town. This was a bit of an adventure came across remnants of an old village and one two other interesting features. Plenty of shade walking through the wooded areas. There is a path that will take you as far as the cable car entrance. After this it becomes more challenging. Couple of quaint little gift shops and cafes on the way. Took about 90 mins to walk down, photo stops included. Don't try this walk in flip flops.If you like great views this is a worthwhile journey, but that's it. There is very little left of the castle now except the main walls, very little to see. If you do decide to walk down it does take you off the beaten track a little."
