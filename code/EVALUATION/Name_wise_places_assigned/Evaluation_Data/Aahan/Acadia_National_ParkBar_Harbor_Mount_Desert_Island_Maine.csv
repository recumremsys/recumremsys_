"We truly enjoyed our bus tour of Acadia National Park. This is an amazing area and our guide, P.J. was fantastic. She related history, information and even some great stories that kept us entertained and interested. We had a Lobster Bake at the beautiful Country Club at the end of the tour and the whole meal was handled efficiently and with true skill - the tour made me want to come back here and stay for about a month - or two!"
"Visited Acadia National Park with a young child and two teens and had a spectacular day! We traveled up Cadillac Mountain and viewed the most incredible panoramic views of the ocean and islands. Visited Sand beach which was beautiful, however waters are way to cold to swim. Went to Jordan Pond and had a great lunch with fantastic view of the “pond”. Recommend the popovers! Visited thunder hole which was very cool as you could watch the waves crash into a hole and make a thundering sound effect! The park is picturesque! We will be back!! Schoodic point off of Route 1 is also amazing!!! We LOVE Maine!"
"My husband and I visited Acadia National Park today and it was breathtaking.  The fall colors were beautiful,  accented by the blue water.  We drove the Park Loop Road which is 26 miles long and goes around the entire park.  There are several pull overs where you can stop and get pictures.  Every stop was worth stopping for.  The drive itself is so pretty with the winding roads lined with trees.  It wasn't extremely busy but a couple places we did have a hard time finding parking.....being persistent we eventually found a spot.  This is definitely worth visiting.  Think it's the prettiest national park I've seen."
"My wife and I were amazed by this park. Seeing the ocean, the woods and the mountains was amazing.Make sure you go up to Cadillac Mountain and walk the loop. Also go back for the sunset."
"We spent a few days exploring the park with a friend from the area. We made multiple hikes and have left postings on individual stops. Having a local guide was a major plus, however there are numerous resources, guidebooks, TA reviews! and National Park signs that make this a very easy place to enjoy. A true National Treasure and one of the highlights of the East Coast National Park system. Helpful Tips:- Buy a parking pass in advance- Bring Water!- Restrooms are found throughout the park, bring wipes- We found the park to be very dog friendly"
Decided to have a picnic at Thompsons Island for my grand daughters first birthday. I grew up here in Maine and have never had to pay to go to Thompsons Island.I Noticed it requires a park pass now so I head to the Visitor center to purchase one. I had gone online and noticed it said one pass covers 15 people. But that's only if your in one car! Ended up buying 2 for 60 dollars!! Only 8 people are going to be there but had to buy 2! They don't offer A day pass or even a discount for locals! Not even going to use the Pass after today! Thompsons Island isn't even in the park! Greedy people!! For the amount of money they are stealing from people I hope the park is 100% maintaned!
"We enjoyed our time here and there was something for everyone in our family from easy walks to Otter cove to more difficult trails, like Precipice and Beehive. Be sure to catch a few sunrises from Cadillac mountain- arrive at least 45 minutes before sunrise in order to secure parking and a place to view. We saw dolphins from the Schooner Head overlook, so pack some binoculars. The Ocean Path walk was the most beautiful to me because of the water. The 27 mile park loop drive is a nice way to get your bearings on Day 1 and then plan your adventures, or if you don't want to hike you can just drive and park along the way to catch many of the main sights. There are plenty of areas to pull over and catch the views and several parking areas that fill up quickly. The Jordan Pond House is a nice place to take a break. Enjoy!"
"Acadia was a wonderful experience for us. I hope enjoyed the national park and all its wonders including Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond, Thunder Hole and Sand beach. The scenery during our visit was outstanding. Every direction you looked it was like a postcard. Parking tends to get tricky so arrive very well, especially near Jordan Pond. Many great hiking trails for all levels."
Put this on your bucket list for sure! 10 years ago we visited in the early spring and it was awe inspiring. We just did a second trip and the fall colors were beautiful! Even in the drizzling rain it was a beautiful drive with breathtaking scenery.
"WHO KNEW THIS PIECE OF HEAVEN existed on Earth.  Our family is now a hiking family because of Acadia National Park.  What we didn't know is that is can be a difficult park to hike, especially on a 90 degree day.  Make sure and have the right shoes on, bring plenty of water and come enjoy the beauty of this national park that overlooks the ocean.  DON'T MISS OUT"
"My husband and I enjoyed every minute  and every vista of this spectular place. My recommendation is to utilize the bus system they have in the park. Let them do the driving so you can enjoy more of the park. Parking spaces are also a premium inside the park. My favorite memory is stopping at Sand Beach and then walking the trial to Thunder Roll. It’s about two miles and easy. If you are a picture taker like I am, it might take you awhile. Breathtaking views,  It will not disappoint."
"This National Park is great for those who love the outdoors.  There is plenty of activities to do.  Do not miss Cadillac Mountain, Thunder Hole, and hike the many trails throughout the park.  Hike both the Ocean Path Trail and Jordon Pond Trail.  Totally different, but equally beautiful in their own rights."
"We spent a good part of the day exploring Acadia National park. It is a true gem as advertised. The sights are many and varied from up on high at Cadillac Mountain to low on Jordan Pond. You can visit riding in your car around Loop Road if hiking is not your strong suit, or you can hike till your hearts content with the many trails that are well marked. For us, the view atop Cadillac Mt. was the best and can only be reached by car."
"It was NOT crowded when we went and we had an amazing time. The key to visiting this park is to time it correctly. September was great -- no leaf color, so what? Also no crowds. We went on one of the more popular hikes totally alone, not seeing a soul, in the early morning, and we loved it so much. The park is amazingly beautiful. Check the tide schedules, the cruise ships arrivals, and don't be too concerned about the weather dress for it and embrace the fog or whatever. Cadillac Mtn. -- you don't have to go at sunrise or sunset to love it. We went well after sunrise and it was still gorgeous. Thunder Hole when not thundering -- so what ... the view was still awesome. Do the stuff you want to do early in the day and be flexible."
"There are so many incredible hikes, I wish we had more time.  We coupled up some hikes together to get the distance we wanted.  There were many incredible views (highly recommend Gorham and Beech mountains) with a lot of rock scrambling throughout the park.  Make sure your shoes have good support and traction."
Loved hiking in Acadia.  There is a hike for everyone's ability.  We stayed in Otter Creek so were able to access some trailheads minutes from our AirBnB.  I'd recommend staying in a place where you don't have to park.  A lot more convenient.
"We have been coming to Acadia for years and will continue.  The park has features and views you won’t find anywhere else.  One of our favorite parts of the park is the Seawall area.  A little quieter and great trails, picnic area, and campground. Don’t miss the Schoodic part of Acadia- beautiful views, great campground and hiking, and BEST OF ALL- less crowds!  We loved being able to park and find a campsite.  If you really want some Bar Harbor time or to visit the main section of the park, there is a wonderful ferry from Schoodic to downtown Bar Harbor.  From there you can walk to all the shops and restaurants in Bar Harbor or get on a small bus that takes you throughout the park.  You get to do the park or town and do t have to worry about the difficulty of finding parking!"
"Our kids are 5 and 7 and they made it through both these hikes and the Gorham Mountain trail in two days and had a blast. The mountain trail is quite taxing, but the view at the top is worth it. It is short and coming down is really fast so you can keep walking along the coast after that. Also, there are no restrooms at the Gorham Mtn trailhead, so plan accordingly. Stop by Thunder Hole and hear the awesome sound. This is a tourist bus stop so it is very busy. If you want to park there get there at 8am.  There is a gift shop and restroom. Get your parking pass the day before you go if you can—it will be good for 7 days and is required for parking anywhere in the Park. The entire park has paved roads to each lot and the drive is nice too!"
"What an amazing place!  It was on our bucket list for years.We are not hikers (wife's knee replacement surgery earlier this year) but we still had a blast.  We stayed four nights in a local campground (Hadley's Point) and never ran out of things to see or do, even without doing a backcountry hiking trip.  Be sure to stop at the overlooks and take in the beautiful sights."
"Really enjoyed hiking here for the views from the top. I hiked the Bowl trail while my husband hiked the Beehive. I’m afraid of heights and could tell from the parking lot that I could not handle the Beehive. I visited The Bowl (pond) and took a trail that took us to the coastline. Also hiked Acadia and Saint Sauveur Mountain trails.  Enjoyed it very, very much. Challenging but rewarding!"
"We brought our children here and now our grandchildren. We have been averaging a visit every three years for the last 30 years. Hiking, biking and kayaking are all top notch. Hiking is great because you can find trails for all ages. Great views from the top and many super views going up or coming down or both. Some have ladders, some iron rungs and others with beautiful granite steps. Scrabbling over rocks is fun for all ages. The biking trails were once carriage trails and one can still book a ride on a carriage but bikes are perfect. Many beautiful bridges were built and are beautiful as well as functional. As you bike up mountains you are rewarded by ever expanding ocean views. Kayaking can be in the ocean or on placid ponds. Views and wildlife are beyond words. Throw in some Jordan Pond popovers and Beals’s Lobsters and life gets no better."
"Acadia may be a smaller National Park, but it has plenty to see and do. That is why you will want at least 3 days and more if possible to experience this park. Take a hike as there are easy to very demanding hiking trails.The scenery on one of these hikes is remarkable. Take a bus tour to hear the information and gain a better understanding of the park and how it came to be. Take a carriage ride if time and weather permits. Do not forget your camera as between the shoreline scenery and the mountaintop vistas you will want to save the experience. We came at the request of our daughter and boy were we glad we visited. Outstanding park."
"We like to hike, can also drive to everything. beautiful scenery including Sand Beach, Thunder Hole and Cadillac Mountain. We also drove the Schoodic Scenic Byway. Had popovers and tea at Jordan pond. If you like flower gardens and landscapes Thuya Garden Lodge and Asticou Azalea Garden"
"My visit to Acadia National Park was amazing and surreal. Visiting the park during fall was the best decision I made. Beauty of this park was beyond my expectations. The ocean, mountains and little towns were all beautiful. I highly recommend this park to all who can visit."
"Acadia was new for our family, who often vacation out west.  It’s just gorgeous, and the hiking is amazing. And while August is clearly the busiest month, it wasn’t as crowded as I feared.  Parking lots fill quickly, but the Island Explorer buses get you around the park efficiently so you don’t need your car. We will be back!"
Acadia is a beautiful park and  had never heard of it until we planned our cruise. Be sure to get to the top of Cadillac Mountain and to the beach. The blowhole is great when the tide is high. Take a guide such as MDI Tours.
We had a great day at this National Park. We spent about 6 hours in the park stopping at all of the major attractions. Took some great walks on very well maintained trails. Stopped at the Jordan Pond House for our popovers. They were delicious. We were surprised that in what is not a prime season that parking was limited and waits significant.
"First off, we went with a 25 year old, not a teen and we are complete nature lovers. The park can take many days to actually go through so if you have limited time, the must sees are Jordan Pond, Thunder Hole, Sand Beach. We could have spent hours just sitting on rocks and watching the waves crashing, it was that awesome. But read about the park in other reviews. I just want to give some money and time saving tips.We stayed in Lincolnville and drove 2.5 hours to the park. The reason was Bar Harbor is a very touristy place and the hotels are not that great and overpriced. Also the Atlantic Highway drive from Camden/ Linconville is breathtaking and since we went in the fall, it was present in all its glory! It was definitely time well spent. Lincolnville has some beautiful B&Bs, with phenomenal views, very quiet and serene. We enjoyed our sunrises there and some delicious breakfast at Dot’s (a quaint bakery with delish homemade goodies). The best way to see the park is to drive in to Bar Harbor and take advantage of the free parking at the end of Main Street. Then walk back to the square in MainStreet (10 min) and take buses to the park. The LLBean buses take you to different spots in the park and they are free of charge. They only run until the Sunday of Columbus Day weekend- important! You can use the buses to go to and from various stops inside the park and eventually back to Bar Harbor Square. No headache of payment of $30 for parking inside the park, nor looking for parking which is hard to do. Bar Harbor itself is a lovely town with all the activity concentrated on Main Street; usual souvenir stores, restaurants, and speciality stores. We didn’t eat there as we had gotten custom made sandwiches from Dot’s and had a picnic in the park. Best to take food and drinks and water with you as it’s not easily available all over the place. Wet wipes and Kleenex as well some very basic first aid is a good idea to carry along in your backpack. Sneakers are the way to go as there are several trekking and hiking trails and it’s mountainous and rocky in some parts. Gets cool, so a jacket is always a good idea."
We enjoyed several days in Acadia National Park. Just follow the Park Loop and discover beautiful places along. Gorgeous coastline and quite bicycle paths. Catching the sunrise from the top of Cadillac Mountain was spectacular. Lots to do in Acadia. Hope we will back soon 😁
"We spent 3 days hiking and sightseeing at Acadia National Park.  I would say that was the perfect amount of time to visit. My husband and daughter hiked the Beehive and Precipice Trails and they loved them.  It was some of the most difficult, scary and rewarding hikes they have ever done.(See other posts on these trails) Must be very fit to do them and no fear of heights.  Other trails that we all enjoyed was the South Bubble Trail to Bubble Rock. (Make sure not to miss the view of Jordan Pond once you are at Bubble Rock. Head down a short path toward Jordan Pond once you reach the top) We also enjoyed the Great Head Trail, and Ocean Trail. All the trails we hiked had some amount of rock scrambling and elevation change.  We had lunch and popovers at Jordan Pond House.  The popovers were good, but not sure they live up to the hype.  If you have a clear night, drive back into the park to see an amazing amount of stars and part of the Milky Way. We drove to Bass Harbor to see a sunset along with the hundreds of others trying to get a good picture.  If you do this, you have to get there at least an hour before sunset or more.  Parking is crazy there and in popular points along Loop road, which is one way traffic in most of it.  We saw some tide pools at Schooner Head Trail, but didn't see much, except a few things in the anemone cave, which has to be visited at low tide only and is very slippery.  I highly recommend taking some sort of boat tour to see the islands from the water as well as spending a half day to shop around Bar Harbor. It was a beautiful place to visit!"
"We so enjoyed our trip to this beautiful national park. We went in October so we had cool temps and cheerful fall foliage waiting for us when we arrived in Bangor. The weather was a bit rainy and overcast most of the time but, in my opinion, that only added to the ethereal, mystical feel of the ferns, trails, mosses, mushrooms, forests and coastline. And when the sun came out on our last day, you felt as if you had a whole new park to explore. So worth the time. Come to this beautiful park, you will love it!"
We booked through Norwegian Cruise Line. Their tour does NOT stop to let you take pictures or experience this magnificent park.  The bus only stopped at a nature center to see native plants. The rest of the tour was a drive by only. Other tours were stopped along the way to see the gorgeous shoreline and scenery. We also had the lobster bake with this tour and that part was great. Make sure you book with a company that will allow you to experience this wonderful park.
"A trip through Acadia is very peaceful and serene. There are a lot of stopping spots for scenic views, and in the summer, it can be moderately crowded. We set up chairs on the rock cliffs and watched the waves crash the shore for hours. Take some hiking boots or a bike and enjoy this gem!!"
"It has been three weeks since we did our road trip to Acadia National Park in Maine.  Prior to the trip, I had committed to myself to document this trip and to write a review on TripAdvisor, as I had been benefiting from the reviews on TripAdvisor all these years, so it’s time for me to contribute my fair share.  Let’s get started.We are a family of four: my husband and I in our 50’s and our sons 19 and 14; and we live in western Nassau County on Long Island.  The trip was for eight days seven nights from 8/25/19 to 9/1/19.  We had initially wanted to make an overnight stop both on our way there and on our return trip.  We did stop for one night in Portland, Maine, going there.  However, we couldn’t find any hotel affordable on our way back, which was the Labor Day weekend, so we drove straight home.  Otherwise, we would like to stop at Kennebunkport in Maine or Providence in Rhode Island.Day 1: We left at 5:15 AM and followed the Waze directions.  Traffic was smooth and we arrived in Old Port District in Portland around 9:45 AM (don’t ask how fast we were driving).  Our first stop was The Holy Donut.  The wait was about 35 minutes, and we picked up six donuts (bacon cheddar, holy cannoli triple berry, sweet potato ginger glazed, Maine blueberry, dark chocolate sea salt and honey lavender), with coffee.  We had a couple of the donuts there and saved some for dessert later.  The bacon cheddar (savory) and dark chocolate sea salt were our favorite.  We then walked around Old Port District, which has plenty of shops, and had lunch at Portland Lobster Company, where we ordered lobster roll ($18 with fries), clam chowder, fried clams and steamers.  The food was overall good.  Next we headed to Portland Head Lighthouse in Fort Williams Park.  It is a large, beautiful waterfront park with big picnic areas equipped with barbeque grills.  There was a family grilling lobsters.  What a great idea!  We then went to Allagash Brewery but couldn’t make their tours, which require advance booking.  Anyway, we did the flight (four 3-oz. beer at $2-$3 each).  We then decided to have an early dinner before checking in our hotel and arrived at Duckfat around 4:45 PM. There was still a 45-minute wait.  We had charcuterie board with four items (chicken pate, ham, smoked salmon and smoked duck), poutine (fried in duck fat), duck confit panini, pull pork panini and brisket panini.  Duck is definitely their specialty and the poutine was sinfully delicious and worthy of every calorie.  We finally checked in Holiday Inn by the Bay after dinner.Day 2: We checked out the hotel at 10 AM and headed to the L.L. Bean flagship store 25 minutes away.  We found the merchandises at the flagship store very expensive, so we went to their outlet store across the street.  The outlet strip has many other stores such as Under Armor, Nike, Brooks Brothers, Gap, Banana Republic, etc.  After we left the outlet strip, we continued our way up north for about 40 minutes and stopped at Red’s Eats for lunch.  It was around 1 PM when we arrived.  The line didn’t look too bad, but boy, their service was extremely slow and we waited almost two hours.  During the wait, the staff passed out umbrellas, water and watermelon.  We ordered lobster roll ($24), fried clams, fried scallops and fried shrimps.  Note that it’s a cash-only place.  The lobster roll was both excellent in quality and quantity and the lobster meat was plump, tender and sweet.  But surprisingly good were the scallops, which we wished we had ordered more.  As we continued our trip, we made a side stop at Maine Central Institute in Pittsfield, approximately 75 minutes after Red’s Eats, to visit the school my husband went to over 30 year ago.  From there we drove to Bar Harbor another 90 minutes north.  Acadia National Park is located on Mount Desert Island and we stayed in Bar Harbor, which town has the most tourists on the Island.  Note that cellular reception is spotty on the Island.  So make sure you sort of know your directions or have a satellite type GPS handy.  We stopped in downtown before checking in our hotel and had dinner at Blaze.  There was a 40-minute wait and we had mussels, pork belly lollipops, tacos and pizzas.  The pork belly lollipops were succulent and delicious.  The mussels and pizzas were also good, but the tacos were a little disappointing.Day 3: Acadia Inn offers free continental breakfast, so we had breakfast at the hotel every day before heading out.  We first headed to Hulls Cove Visitor Center.  Every car and every person needs to pay to access Acadia National Park ($30 per car or $15 per person for seven days).  The pass allows you to park in the Park and use the Island Explorer buses that essentially stop at all the points of interest on the Island.  We did not use the buses but I could definitely see the convenience of using them during the peak season, which had just ended the week before we were there.  Nonetheless, there were still a lot of cars and tourists, and parking is probably a nightmare during the peak season.  Also the buses can be useful for people who do one-way hikes.  At the Visitor Center, you can ask the park rangers questions and pick up a free map, which our hotel also offered.  There are additional hiking maps for sale for a few dollars.  There are many trails in the Park at various difficulty levels, so be aware of what you are getting on.  You can also research online.  We are not experienced hikers and we were not well equipped, so we stayed away from any hiking trails that mentioned iron rungs.  The Park offers ranger-led tours, some with a cost.  I would have taken the birdwatching tour but it was not available the week we were there.  I suppose the season for birdwatching had ended.  So after the Visitor Center, we got on Park Loop Road, which goes around the Park, to get a flavor of the Park.  Note that part of Park Loop Road is one way, so in order to do the full loop, you need to turn left at the sign that says one way only to Sand Beach, which comes up a little after the Cadillac Mountain entrance.  Our plan was to make a few stops and some short hiking along Park Loop Road.  We first stopped at Sieur de Monts, which has a garden, a nature center and a couple of short, easy trails.  We did the ½ mile Jesup Path there.  We then made a few stops, including Schooner Head Overlook (5-minute walk down); Sand Beach (equipped with bathroom and changing room); Thunder Hole (20 steps down the rocks); and Otter Point (not as pretty as Thunder Hole).  There are many pullovers in between.  We then stopped at Jordon Pond House to try their famous popovers.  We would have just ordered a few popovers for takeout and had them at a picnic table or bench.  But they do not allow popovers for takeout.  So after a 20-minute wait, we ordered some popovers, smoked salmon and cheese plate appetizers.  Their popovers did live up to the hype, but the rest was mediocre.  We then walked the 3.2-mile Jordan Pond Path that goes around the Pond.  The entrance is right next to the restaurant.  The park ranger had said it was an easy trail.  Well, we started the Path to the right (counterclockwise).  It was flat and easy in the beginning, but approximately two-thirds in, the Path became all rocks and wood planks.  The sign at the entrance of the Path says 2 1/2 hours; but we finished in 90 minutes.  Though it was not easy, it’s totally doable.  We then left the Park and headed to The Travelin’ Lobster for dinner.  It’s a shack with outdoor seating.  There was a 10-minute wait and we had clam chowder, lobster bisque, lobsters, mussels, lobster grilled cheese panini.  All were good.Day 4: The boys had booked a kayak tour for the afternoon at Marine State Sea Kayak, which is located in Southwest Harbor of the Island, approximately 20 minutes away from our hotel.  So we decided to explore Southwest Harbor a little in the morning.  We first headed to Charlotte Rhoades Park and Butterfly Garden.  It is a very small, but beautiful garden with a couple of waterfront picnic tables.  It is free, although they suggest donations.  We spent 30 minutes there.  Then we went to Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse about 10 minutes away, which is a working lighthouse with someone living there.  The parking lot is very small, but there is not much to see other than the Lighthouse, so people typically come and go.  We spent approximately 15 minutes there.  Next we went to Thurston’s Lobster Pound 10 minutes away.  They have a covered dining area.  There were a lot of mosquitoes the day we went, no wonder bug spray was provided at the entrance to the dining area.  We only tried their lobster rolls, which were also good.  We then went to Main Street in Southwest Harbor about 15 minutes away and walked around the few blocks.  There are not many stores, but we liked Sawyer’s Market, a local grocery store.  We bought some wines, organic strawberries and a huge blueberry muffin (yum!) from there.  Then was the time to check in the boys at Marine State Sea Kayak.  Since there was not much else to do in Southwest Harbor, my husband and I headed back to the Bar Harbor downtown.  There we did the Shore Path, which is a waterfront path, one mile one-way.  Use Google map to Bar Harbor Town Pier and start the Path there.  The Path is parallel to Main Street, so when you finish the Path, you can walk a couple of blocks down to Main Street, and walk back to your starting point from there.  There are plenty of shops on or near Main Street.  We had ice cream at Mount Desert Island Ice Cream and tried strawberry, lemon poppy berry swirl and cafe breve flavors.  After a few hours of shopping, we went back to Marine State Sea Kayak to pick up the boys, who said they had a great time and saw seals, porpoises, bald eagles and other birds.  For dinner, we were looking for Italian, not just pizza.  There’s definitely a shortage of Italian restaurants in Bar Harbor.  We ended up at Mama DiMatteos in downtown and had pizza and pasta, which were all quite good.  Also the restaurant has its own parking lot, which is a gem for downtown.Day 5: It was a rainy day, the only one during our stay there.  It’s a challenge to find things to do since there are not much indoor activities on the Island.  We had planned to go to the Northeast Harbor Farmers Market, which is on Thursdays only and about 20 minutes away.  There is another Farmers Market in Bar Harbor on Sundays, but we were not there on either Sunday before or after.  We went anyway and were disappointed to see only a few vendors open.  After a little research, we decided to go back to the towns before the bridge to Mount Desert Island, since there are more big name retail stores to spend a rainy day in.  One of the beauties with Mount Desert Island is there are no chain or franchise stores on the Island.  Anyway, we found a place called Big Chicken Barn Books & Antiques in Ellsworth, which is the town before Trenton, which is before the bridge.  It took us approximately 45 minutes to get there.  Big Chicken Barn Books & Antiques, as it is called, is a big barn that sells old books and stuffs.  I’m not sure if they are antiques but they are old.  After that, we were going to go to a TJ Maxx just to stay indoor, but we saw a Renys, which is a local discount store, so we shopped there instead.  There is a L.L. Bean outlet across from Renys.  On our way back, right before the bridge, we stopped at Trenton Bridge Lobster Pound and tried their lobster, lobster rolls and clam chowder.  The food was just as good as other places.  We were then back on the Island and headed to Atlantic Brewing Company on Knox Road.  We arrived there 10 minutes before their next tour and were fortunate enough to get a spot.  Their tours are free on a first-come first-serve basis.  The tour was informative and fun and they were very generous with their beer tasting (soda for the kids).  They also run a barbeque restaurant next door, Mainely-Meat Bar-B-Que, where we had their Max Plate samplers, which was a lot of food for a good price.  So this rainy day turned out not bad for us.Day 6: We wanted to do some hiking for our final two days and decided on two longer trails: the Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road and the Eagle Lake Carriage Road.  These are carriage roads and are flat and wide, suitable for bikes and dogs.  In the hindsight, it’d be more fun for the boys to bike on these carriage roads instead, as they found them boring.  There is a small parking lot with a sign “Eagle Lake Carriage Road” on Route 233, which is approximately ¾ mile east of Google map “Carriage Road” destination.  From this parking lot, you walk a one-mile path and choose the Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road on one side and the Eagle Lake Carriage Road on the other.  We did the 5.5-mile Witch Hole Pond Carriage Road, saving the Eagle Lake Carriage Road for the following day.  Afterwards, we headed to Indian Point Blagden Preserve about 15 minutes away.  It’s a little known place with some trails that lead to the water.  The Big Wood Trail there was unmarked, so we instead took the road down (there are some private properties along the road) and then took the Shore Trail, altogether about 1.5 miles one way.  We were hoping to see some wildlife but were disappointed as we only saw a deer.  Our plan for the day was to watch sunset that evening, so we headed back to Acadia National Park.  To kill some time, we did another trail up to Bubble Rock.  The parking lot for this trail is between Cadillac Mountain and Jordan Pond on Park Loop Road.  The trail is only ½ mile one way but it is rocky and uphill, so it was a little challenging (I learnt that my memory foam shoes were not made for hiking).  There is an intersection midway and we took the south trail.  The view up there was gorgeous.  Since it was too early for sunset, we went to Jordan Pond House for an early dinner, mostly for their popovers again.  There was no wait and we had popovers, lobster salad, lobster, scallops, crab and lobster cakes, and BLTT sandwich (I know it’s a lot of food).  Again, other than the popovers, the rest was mediocre especially considering the price.  After dinner, we drove up Cadillac Mountain to Blue Hill Overlook, which faces west, for sunset.  There is a sign for Blue Hill Overlook Parking before reaching the top.  It was very cold and windy, but the sunset was absolutely beautiful.Day 7: We went back to the same parking lot as the day before, looking to do the 6-mile Eagle Lake Carriage Road.  That parking lot, however, was full and we found another parking lot across, which is for Eagle Lake only.  There is a kayak/boat launch area at the entrance.  We went clockwise around the Lake, as we were told it was easier.  Approximately two miles in, there was an option to continue on carriage road or take a 1.2-mile Eagle Lake Trail that tugs around the lake.  Since the boys were bored by the carriage road, we took the Eagle Lake Trail, which was quite rocky.  The trail eventually merges back on the carriage road.  Since we had now worked up our appetite, and the boys had not checked out the Bar Harbor downtown (they were taking a kayak tour when we spent an afternoon there), we went there again.  We went to Bar Harbor Popcorn and had their blueberry and cheddar popcorns, and then CJ’s Ice Cream & Yogurt and had their blueberry soft serve.  They were all fantastic.  We then walked around the shops, relaxed at the Town Pier a little, and since it was low tide, we were able to walk across the Sand Bar to Bar Island (look for sign and direction at the Town Pier).  We were quite exhausted after all that and had an early dinner at The Stadium Restaurant and Gallery.  This restaurant accepts reservations for lobster dinner, which is great if you are tired of waiting.  For $30, you get a 1.25 lb. lobster, clam chowder, cornbread, coleslaw and corn.  We did not expect so much food and we also ordered burger and hot dogs as well.  The food was great and the staff was even greater.  It was a perfect meal to wrap up our stay at Mount Desert Island.Day 8: This was our day of departure and we had approximately eight hours of driving to get home.  So we got up very early and headed to Cadillac Mountain for sunrise, which is supposedly the first sunrise of the day in America.  We arrived at the Cadillac Mountain summit at 4:45 AM.  At that time, the parking lot was almost full.  Although we were better prepared than the day we watched sunset, it was even colder.  But it was absolutely worth it and the sunrise was amazing.  Leaving Cadillac Mountain took a little time due to everyone leaving at the same time.  On our return trip home, we stopped at Maine Diner in Wells for brunch.  Wells is a town adjacent to Kennebunkport and this diner was seen in triple D on Food Network.  The wait was about 30 minutes and the food was good diner food at a good price.  We then drove straight home without incidence.To sum up, it was a wonderful trip that I think everyone should take at least once in their lifetime.  All the people we came across were very kind and nice, and not once we felt we were treated differently or anything less (we are Chinese).  We found both Portland and Mount Desert Island very family friendly, dog friendly and LGBT friendly, and we felt welcomed everywhere we went.  The only disappointment with this trip was the scarcity of wildlife we saw, which I suppose was due to the season.After almost 20 lobster rolls, our survey (n=4) came to a unanimous decision: Red’s Eats was the best.  Would we wait two hours again?  Probably not, but I’ve been told that the line could be much shorter on a rainy day or if you arrive in the late afternoon.  So time your visit wisely."
We really enjoyed the park loop which allowed us to tour the entire park and make frequent stops for photo opportunities. Be forewarned...it is very windy on top of Cadillac mountain but the view is spectacular.
