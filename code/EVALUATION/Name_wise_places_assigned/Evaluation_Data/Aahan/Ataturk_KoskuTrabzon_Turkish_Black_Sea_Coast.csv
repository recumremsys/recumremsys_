Great location. It is in the park. I wish I had a house like that . Don't expect too much. Need renovations for lighting. Some lights are missing some of them replaced by led lighting and it's not matching with nature of items.
"Visiting fee is 9 TL, however it deserve it, great place to visit and have a cup of tea in the garden. You can wonder inside the palace and take pictures. Enjoy"
Went there during Trabzon tour. There is not that much to see in the city. but really nice to visit the villa since you are already there. Only costs 2 TL for Adults and 1 TL for children
it is a nice lovely pavillion with nice views from the balconies. go there and see it. there are some interesting pieces that was once belonged to the founder of turkish republic.
Elegant building in nicely groomed garden with period furniture. Could get very crowded. Looked like it got public transportation. Poor service in the lovely garden cafe try the one across from the museum a little bit better but do not expect much.
"Well worth a visit! Lovely gardens and the Pavilion of three floors is very interesting. Fitted with the original furniture and lots of pictures of Kemal Ataturk.Gives a great glimpse into a bit of history and gives some good views as well.One can reach there by bus - need a bus card - or get there by taxi. Getting a return ride is simpler by bus, but they do not take cash. Be sure to pre-arrange a taxi for your return. One can easily complete the tour within an hour and even less if there are crowds. We went early morning 09h30, but could be busier later. As the access is quite small, I suggest one avoids the crowds."
"A pretty building - a summer pavilion rather than a traditional house.  Taken from the original owner during the population exchange, I think, and later given to Ataturk.Attractive gardens.  Interior currently closed for renovations.  Worth visiting if you are nearby but not if you need to spend time getting there."
Very high level house built almost a century ago. Located on a hill and in a very large garden. The sea view is amazing. I would expect a better preserved furnitures within the house.
"If you have liked the building in which Trabzon museum is housed, don't miss to visit the Ataturk Kosku! Not that much for the exhibits (unless you are an Ataturk fan), but for the chance to admire another example of well preserved early 20th century Black Sea villa located in a well maintained garden about 6,5 km south of the city center.In order to reach it, take the Cumhuriet street (the one where Demirgrand hotel is located) going down the hill in the direction of the sea, cross the busy coastal road using a pedestran only bridge, buy the bus tickets at the newspaper / snacks stall you'll see as soon as you've descended from the bridge (don't forget to buy the return tickets, too) and find the bus marked ""Park - Kosk"" on the big local bus terminal just beside.Once in the villa, don't forget to check the period kitchen and bathroom as well. Enjoy a tea in the garden of the villa or in a tea garden just across the street (there you'll also find a big shop selling very tastefully made jewellery with semi precious stones)."
"This is a wonderful place to learn a little, or a lot, about the history and politics of Turkey, although you will need a guide or a local to tell you about it. The place is kept as it was around a century ago, with all the pieces of furniture. Atatürk slept in there when he visited the city and then it was donated to him by its citizens, to revert to the ownership of Trabzon after his death.The gardens are awesome and they were full of tulips in bloom when we visited. Take your time to wonder around and explore every corner, from front to back. The view from the balcony is also really worth it."
"Previous a large private summer residence outside Trabzon city center. Built by a greek (greek-russian ?) businessman.Not big as a museum but a a place in honour of Ataturk.Worth a visit, although the place is high up there is not a panoramic view.Taxi up easiest.Bus down if taxi is not waiting (Busticket at the entrance booth)."
"In reality another beautiful ex-Greek owned, like every house from the old Trabzon. Built  around 1900 and served the Theofylaktos family till 1917. After that with the organised excile and genocide plan from the New Turcs it was confiscated. Mustafa Kemal just stayed there for some days and within the plan of renaming greek and armenian buildings and streets, in order to be forgotten from history, the mansion was called by the official state and some Turcs as Ataturk's house. Like the well known Museum of Trabzon-The Kostaki Mansion in the center... !"
"During our preparation to visit Trabzon- Ataturk Pavilion was among the hot spots. We decided to include this attraction in our short list. Reaching the site by public transportation was easy. Many other visitors choose to rent a car, some with a driver. The public transportation driver charges little extra as this Pavilion is located remotely. The nice building is dated back to year 1890. It was little rainy and heavily cloudy.  In general  the temperature in mid-October was nice. The Pavilion location and architecture style were exceptional. The garden was well organized. The fees I would say were exaggerated for such attraction."
"Although Mustafa Atatürk only stayed here once Or twice in his life, it certainly is worth the visit, just because the house is an eyecatcher. Don’t forget to check out the garden as well"
Dolmus from opposite Garanti Bankasi and in front of ING is TL 3.5 to Kusk. Remember to stay on bus to top of hill where the Vila is situated. Good exterior. Not much inside and what could be a spectacular view of the coastline is obscured by conifers. Easy bus ride back to the centre from outside the gates.
"Build by the wealthy greek banker Karayannidis as his house and served him and his family till the 1917. After that with the new Turcs movement it was confiscated (nationalised) and Mustafa Kemal stayed there for some days (around two days). Very nice exterior and garden. Very interesting for people who like ""tinny"" beuty and relaxed atmosphere."
"I was stuck in Trabzon for a couple days in January because my flight to Istanbul was redirected there due to the snow storm that was battering Istanbul's airport. Deciding to make the most of the fact that we could not continue our journey back to Uzbekistan, I with my mum and another passenger decided to visit some places in Trabzon. This was one of the few we visited and while I wouldn't say it was extremely exciting, there wasn't anything that made me say wow, it was quite a nice house, with old carpets, and tiles."
"We took a local minibus up to Ataturk Kosku (3.5TL one way).  The house is very well preserved as it would have been when used as a summer house. Yo do get the feeling of how historic this house is by the number of locals visiting.There are a number of artefacts and furniture which are very in keeping with the period. The views from the house and gardens over looking the city to the sea are very good.Only cost 8.5TL for an entrance ticket.In summary, an excellent place to visit to embrace a slice of history, well worth the effort. Recommended."
