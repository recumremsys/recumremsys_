"When I visited San Francisco, I wasn’t that keen on going to Alcatraz but figured that it was something you “had” to do while there. I was surprised at how good the audio tour was, with sound effects and good voice acting. I really felt  like I was there. If would recommend dedicating most of the day to this, take some lunch and walk around the island if the weather is good enough. Seeing San Francisco over the water is a decent view."
Alcatraz is a must see when in San Fran.We went in February so it was fairly quiet but the ferry service to Alcatraz was still busy. Recommend booking in advance for the allocated timeslots to leave for the island.Great audio tour is very atmospheric with Alcatraz being so much more than just the jail.
"Booked this tour in advance online (90 days before) to ensure I got the day I wanted.  It is very well attended.  Price was £31 per person which includes the boat ride, tour of the prison, audio tour & access to the whole ""Rock"".  We took 3 hours so allow a morning or afternoon.  You book onto a tour starting time but can stay all day if you want.  The prison is very informative & definitely interesting.  The walk around the garden is enjoyable (even in January) If you are a history buff or enjoy films, you will enjoy this as it is very historical.  It is managed by the National Parks Service so well worth the money as you are paying to not only pay for its keep but to keep it maintained for generations to come."
"I went to Alcatraz in 1993, I loved it then and loved it this time too. We opted for the night tour. You get over early enough to take daytime pictures and then its into the cell house via the showers where inmates would have entered on their arrival at the Rock. The audio tour was good and its quite an eerie place to be during the day but night time ups the anti somewhat. You must book your tickets some time in advance to ensure you get tickets. Enjoy!!"
Visited Alcatraz with my family and truly enjoyed the Island. I was actually surprised at the knowledge that was provided. We all had a great time and are glad that we got to experience it. A must do if you are in San Francisco. We were visiting family from NC and would definitely go back again. Don’t miss this if you have the chance to go.
"Have always wanted to visit Alcatraz and was glad I did. It’s really really busy and lots of areas not open to the public but the information is good. We picked up an audio tour at the main prison and I think this is essential for an informative visit, you can pause and re-start it again as needed. Great attraction."
"We booked in advance to ensure we got the date & time we wanted. It was really well organised from collecting the tickets at the pier to boarding the boat. There’s a little buggy to take you up the hill. It’s a 15-20 minute steep walk up so if in doubt get the buggy. There’s signs to tell you what time the buggy goes back down & they will also let you preboard the boat should you need more time.Once you’re inside the prison it’s all pretty much on the flat apart from steps to go up but I’m sure I saw a sign for a lift.Everyone we came into contact with was polite & helpful. Do not delay, book today! You won’t regret it. Oh & definitely get the audio tour."
Paying full price for an outside look was just not worth it.  The COVID excuse is lame. There were low numbers of people and they could have easily had the tours.
"Booking for the tour was fairly straightforward and the fact that only one company runs the tour makes it very easy. When we got off the boat we attended an information talk given by one of the ranger. Then we headed to watch a short film about the island. Make sure you take the free audio guide and then head to a self guided tour of the prison. There was a special exhibition in one of the buildings however we were unable to get to it. There are some great views of the San Fran city from the island. We spent just over 4 hours at the island, one can easily spend more time but allow at least 4hrs to make the most of your visit. My only comment will be regarding the terms and conditions listed in pre-booked online tickets. It asked us to arrive at the pier an hour in advance and bring an ID for everyone who was taking the cruise. However when we got there, we were told to come back 15mins or so before the boat departure time. We could have used that time elsewhere instead of waiting at the pier in the rain. Also the pier building is closed for renovations, so we had to wait outside in the open with only a few under cover areas. Our ID's were also not checked."
We had a very interesting day but we feel we made a mistake taking the 1230 ferry as we did not have enough time to see it all. Leave on an early ferry is our recommendation. A must do and see while in SF. All staff at the park were friendly and very willing to answer questions.
Booked online so not expensive. Crew were extremely helpful and on the Island the Park Rangers and staff were friendly. They cater for any visitors who have difficulty walking and provide a shuttle to the cell block. A fantastic experience with the audio commentary a real highlight. If you visit San Francisco be sure to go but book in advance it gets busy and you may not get the day you want.
I've visited Alcatraz a few times since I live in San Jose. I've been there when I was in elementary school as a field trip and I was there early this year. They have improved the tour process A LOT! The only downfall is that as time passes more and more places within Alcatraz are restricted to tourists. I do understand why they do this but it's just a bummer!. Make sure to go when you are nearby
It was okay. There aren't that many bathrooms. I mean like 2 that's it. No food. No live tour guides. Recommend the boat tours instead  what a waste of prime real estate. Oh you better not be old or handicapped. Not friendly for that.
This was something unique to do. The weather was absolutely perfect end of February and the crowd was not bad at all. Enjoyed the ease of boarding riding the ferry to the island and being able to enjoy the self guided experience at my own pace!
"We recommend booking this in advance as I hear it can get full before the date. We opted for the 10am departure so there was time to get there in the morning but also plenty of time to explore Alcatraz. Boarding the boat was simple and there was plenty of space. Once we arrived, a park ranger gave an insightful and instructive talk which, credit to him was humorous at the same time, and then everyone was free to explore. We looked around the outskirts of the island for a bit, luckily the whole island was still open as the ranger informed us that it would be partially shut in later weeks due to bird nesting. We then proceeded to the free [included] audio tour in the main prison area. This tour was long enough that you get to see everything, but short enough that you don't become bored. The commentary was excellent as well, no monotone voices or long pauses etc. We then went on exploring and also watched the short film that is available, though the room was very cold so it was hard to concentrate! We then departed on a boat of our choosing (you just rock up whenever) and were transported back safely and efficiently. This is a must do if you're visiting San Francisco."
"Seeing San Francisco without going there is a  terrible mistake , I know it's  expensive but the view is amazing and the different stories enthralled me ; especially the inmates who managed to escape and after the visit, I spent hours searching for information about them, did they eventually succeed in reaching the seashore or did they drown? The museum shop is full of quotes and it is really worth seeing. We went there in February , around ten and it was not crowded  and we booked one week in advance .The weather was perfect and the view is superb !"
"I had an amazing time. Would recommend it as the guides know the information and enjoyed what they were doing. Going into areas like the hospital and dungeons were just incredible.  An experience I will remember for a long time, especially the door slam."
"We took the night tour which was awesome because there was almost no one on the island. However it was summer, and it never got dark so it wasn’t creepy. This is still one of our favorite things we’ve done in the city. The history and stories of this place is captivating. Do not skip out on this place when visiting San Francisco but wear a sweater or jacket and comfortable shoes."
Was an amazing experience. Learnt so much about the island and it’s history. Would go back in a heart beat.
"Book ahead! We did even though we visited in February and we couldn’t have gone if we hadn’t. The ferry works to a tight timetable so they throw it about a bit when it sets off, and the tides and the wind can make it a bit rough and there’s a bit of a climb from the dock up to the prison. However it’s worth the effort. The ticket includes a really good audio guide in which former guards and inmates conduct you around the prison. Very informative and entertaining. Enjoy the journey back with views of the bay including the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges."
"Guided by an Audio tour , this island is the history of San Francisco. We spent an hour and got chance to explore the history of Alcatraz."
"We took a Hornblower cruise tour to the island. The walk to the prison is up an incline but there are vehicles that assist the less able. The prison tour stars by collecting a headset and recorder. The narration in English is superb, clear at the right pace and with directions which will never leave you confused or lost. A piece of American history unfolds before your eyes and is described so eloquently through your headphones that the end comes too soon.  We arrived early for our cruise but we’re allowed on an earlier cruise without fuss. You leave the island when you are ready. Boats left every 30 minutes. Well worth a visit. Brings to life films like the Bird Man of Alcatraz and The Rock. Kind of good too to see where Al Capone once stayed. Don’t hesitate..book it."
"Bought tickets in Feb 2020 for Alcatraz. Company changed my tickets to a cruise without my consent. Called tickets after calling several times. Received refund confirmation Mar 15, 2020 with 15 business days wait. UPDATE:. 19 May 2020 and still no refund. Called several times and spent hours on the phone (on hold). There is no excuse to hold my $185 for 2 months and not have the common courtesy of contacting me.Fraudulent company. Will never recommend!"
"I have lived in SF for almost 20 years now and have had countless guests visit the City; the Alcatraz tour is one activity or tour that is often overlooked. Or what happens, is that people want to do the tour last minute and frequently they are not able to get tickets. Think about going (as a couple of with a family, probably with kids over 12 years old) and plan in advance.... it does sell out."
"One of our favorites from our first trip. We did the night tour during the summer and it was amazing. We sailed into the fog and arrived on the island, and after about an hour or so the fog had dissipated leaving some amazing views of the city. Be sure to bring a heavy jacket, it’s super chilly on the island! Make sure you get your tickets far in advance to make sure you can get in. If you show up without one you can’t go on the boat."
When you go to San Francisco you must see Alcatraz. Not so much for the tour of the cell block but more for the history. There’s so much more to Alcatraz than the prison. The guides are excellent and provide lots of fascinating stories. Go between October and February and be treated to the agave trail before the birds take it over.
I've though about going here for ages and I am so happy I finally made it! It is interesting and beautiful. Be sure to check it out!
"It was neat to visit this unique piece of history. Learned some unexpected things from the tour pamphlets. We happened to go when the flies were in full effect and it was fairly obnoxious. One of the park attendants said the flies only tend to last for 2 weeks or so and were far worse a few days before. I recommend you check into the flies before booking if having them crawl on you by the dozens is something that could ruin your time. Will return after Covid, in non-fire, non-fly season when we can take the guided tour into the cells and hear some great historical stories."
"Wow!  Knowing the story of protests and death and more here made this trip surreal! But actually taking the audio tour - walking in the prison and feeling the chills and hearing ""sounds"" was an experience that is unforgettable. The audio tour is WORTH IT!! Hear the details = look in the cells, get the actual story as you move through the cell blocks on Broadway and more. The Black Hole is just the creepiest feeling I have ever experienced! Anyone who tours here and would take a chance on the outside to actually end up in any confinement -- you just have to ask WHY would you do that!! LOL! Bling Blinky of TEXS Shout Out: The island is beautiful - historic and haunting! A Must See!!"
Took my wife and family for her birthday and it was great. Everyone enjoyed themselves. So much fun history and the walking tour really makes it awesome.All the staff were friendly and helpful. They really run the place like a well oiled machine.I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting San Francisco. It was the funnest thing we did while vising the area.
"Popping over ob the boat and arriving at Alcatraz, it really feels earie; like that scene of every movie you've ever seen of Acatraz; but this time you're the prisoner.The site is extremely well-organised. The history is both fascinating and slightly disturbing. We got locked in one of the cells to get the feeling which the prisoners had. It was surreal.Thoroughly recommend the tour and this trip; look out for the seals at the harbour on the way over."
"Alcatraz trip was fun, educational, and very interesting !  The walking tour was really well produced.   Amazed at how the prisoners lived in such a small cell.  Freezing in the winter and baking in the summer.  Not easy time.  Famous inmates was al Capone, machine gun kelly, the bird man of Alcatraz and Mickey Cohen.  I really enjoyed this trip.  Well worth the price."
With the ferry ride over and back around 2:00. Covered the whole island. Audio tour was great. Pleasant surprise were all the flowers in such a desolate and ugly place.
"I went with my 17 year old daughter and we loved it, even though it was cold and wet. My daughter loved the plants, gardens and birds nesting. We both talked out how weather would have impacted people living here and made this a very difficult environment in winter. We noticed the colours (lots of green and pinks) in the paint work, lichen, moss, flowers and the shadows. The shadows cast wonderful stories. The bird life is so abundant and the rock is clearly an important nesting spot. Start with the audio tour, as it is really excellent. Take a moment to sit in the recreation yard and look closely at the gardens. A really surprising place."
"The visit was a lot of fun. The parking lot across the street from the pier was not fun. $48 for all day outdoor parking. Very convenient but expensive. Ferry ride to the island is very clean and organized. The ferry had overpriced food and drinks. Not surprised. No food sold on Alcatraz. Can buy water. The self guided audio tour of the old prison ya very informative and entertaining. The whole tour, including the ferry ride to and from, is a little over three hours. Need to be able to walk uphill to get to the cell block from the pier. I believe golf cart like transportation is available to disabled and elderly.  Many good gift shops on Alcatraz."
