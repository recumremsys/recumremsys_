Arrive early to get in and to find a decent seat - it gets very busy. This is a fine showcase of Rajastani culture. The commentator is good and the performers are skilled and enthusiastic. The show closes with a lovely 73 year old lady dancing with ever greater numbers of pots…
Read the reviews and thought I'd go along as its in the centre of town. Got there for the show (7-8pm) around 620pm which was good guidance as it was already very busy. Got a seat down the front and waited for the show.. I paid for the use of my camera phone as I'd read that…
"Went to see the dance show here, and it was amazing, really great value for money. The dancing was great, the stories behind each were explained (in English and Hindi) and even included some puppets. We bought our tickets online, and good job we did as when we arrived at 18:15…"
"Didn't get back to tour the museum itself.  But we were able to see the wonderful dance show on a Saturday night!  Tried to buy tickets early in the day, but box office didn't open until something like 6:15 before the 7:00 pm show!  We didn't expect the huge crush that there…"
"The museum this haveli hauses does provide visitors  a quick glance of Rajasthani culture.  But the display, the explanation, the direction-line and even the custodial are far away from the caliber of a world class museum.  Having said that, the architecture of this haveli by itself is worth a visit.  It is a drastic change from the bustling old city outside during my visit as the first visitor on that morning.  Get your camera ready.   You can take many beautiful shots in the many courtyards and toward the lake."
"The dancing show was fabulous, loved every bit of it. Does get very busy so best to arrive early, they are very good at squeezing people in. We were lucky getting good seats, imagine if we had sat on ground in middle of the audience it would get quite hard on the knees, older…"
Good place. Do watch the folk dance conducted every evening at 7pm. The museum is overpriced but worth watching
Went with little expectations - 150Rs entrance for the dance show. Absolutely loved it - won’t spoil what happens but would highly recommend - a must do in Udaipur! 
visited this place in the evening..found it more live and beautiful ..they also have lighting around the place ..which make it look more beautiful... Inside bagore ki haveli is dharohar dance programm..will write its review separately...This Gangaur ghat is beautiful in the…
"Enjoyed our short visit, especially the (life-sized) displays with traditional wedding sceneries. Also enjoyed some of the views on to the lake from upstairs, where we also found a number of people selling various (home-made) crafts / gifts."
"The visit was quite short to the place. It was old haveli converted to Museum and art performance. Evening art was missed but the museum is worth a visit. The terrace shows wonderful view of Pichhola lake and I like the most is puppet museum. Do take your camera with you, you…"
"Located on the sides of Lake Pichola,it's an Museum with lots of ancient things like clothes, weapons, utensils etc. Can be covered in 30 mins. The place is partly under renovation."
Very quirky house located right on the lake with interesting exhibits including a creepy doll room. Seemed queit when I visited during the daytime much more relaxed than the city palace 
This is a must watch on a visit to Udaipur. Mesmerizing performances by artists. The  show was so good that even my 3 year old kids enjoyed
We got tickets for the cultural show and it was one of my favorite things to see in Udaipur! The traditional dancing and costumes where amazing! Buy your tickets the night before the show so you can get in early and secure a seat! It fills up fast! This Haveli is also a great…
One of my favorite places in town ! Just stepped in for a show before your Dinner and make a complete evening of the trip!!! Enjoy very much.Tqvm
"We missed the museum due to lack of time but we managed to attend Dharohar, a cultural folk dance show. Thank God we don't miss it.   The show is performed at open air within the haveli and is like a homely private show where people enjoy it in close proximity where there is no…"
"Good presentation once inside but terrible service to purchase tickets and would not accept entrance voucher issued by suppliers. Had to purchase tickets again and nobody at venue are polite or understanding , THE WORST CUSTOMER Service"
"This venue has a cultural show that is a MUST visit for anyone and everyone!! It's everyday for a duration of an hour. Starts at sharp 7:00pm. To get your tickets you need to be there in line atleast by 5:30 as the line gets really long. Or, I'd strongly advise to get your…"
The place is small but lovely. Make sure to visit the evening show. Tickets can(and should) be bought online as in the evening the line is crazy. Be ready to pay more as they charge something for online purchase. The guy at the counter has no idea about online tickets service. 
Had to get the tickets the day before for the following day. Cheap entry and good way to spend the evening.Can get a bit cramped but get there early to chose your seat
"Do not miss this little treasure! Much smaller in scale than City Palace and quiet, too! No crowds At all on a Sunday morning. The first few rooms including the puppet museum will involve the hard sell to buy souvenirs. Nice prices though. They are currently doing more…"
"Situated on the edge of Lake Pichola and so with wonderful views. The haveli was very tired looking and in need of some tlc, as were the museum rooms, including turbans (the world's largest), a puppet room, costumes, etc, but many of the 130+ rooms are not accessible to visitors. We didn't see the cultural show, but perhaps that would have been the better option."
Didn't visit the museum only went there for the folk dance which was a one hour performance and would definitely recommend the same. They presented dance from various regions of Rajasthan which was executed brilliantly..The puppet show as well was great .Only found it weird to…
Attended the evening dance and puppet show at the Bagore ki haveli and it was a treat to watch the same! lovely light and music to compliment the dance show and some amazing dancers too.The 72 year old lady dancer amazed me with her skills!! Must watch for sure.
"We have many reviews about Wats good here , so I will try telling other pointers. Since it's held in open area , so do carry woolens in winters. Camera passes can b bought in the middle of d show as well.. but d whole performances available on YouTube . Be in line by 5:30pm. It…"
Known as the Venice of India this place is very beautiful. A lot less hustle and bustle than Jaipur there are lots of great narrow streets to expolre with shops offering all sorts of trinkets. There are many good restaurants overlooking the lake and many small boats offering…
"Enjoyed looking around this museum. The roof top views across the lake are beautiful and nice to see the city from a different angle. Building was previously a palace and it has been nicely restored. Akso enjoyed the puppet museum, even if it'll make a good location for a horror…"
The haveli is quite small as compared to the city palace and probably will take not more than half an hour. The show is from 7 to 8 pm. Ticket sales start at 6.15. Ideal time to reach here is 5 pm. See the haveli till 5.30 when it closes and then wait for the show ticket sales…
"The is must to-do thing when you visit Udaipur. Since I was there for 4 days, I stood in line on one day and bought the tickets for the next day lease knowing that the tickets are available online. Had I known this, I would have booked it online and skipped the long queue that…"
Nicely organised folk dance from different parts of Rajasthan. Includes puppet show too.. Difficult to get tickets if you don't come atleast 30 minutes before show..
Good little shoe. Arrive early to have tickets. It has a line for foreigner so go directly to thecounter
"Visit during evening time to watch the cultural show, it is really good and worth visiting. Make sure you go on time since there are limited tickets available. Also there is an option to book the tickets online."
A good showcase of the Rajasthani culture. Tickets can be booked online (refer to my pictures for details). Advised to come early to get front row seats (on the mattress) they are the best. 
Classical rajasthani style dance in the evening from 1900 till 2000 is a must. Awesome dance show. Be there early for a nice seat right in the front
