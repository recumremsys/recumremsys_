"The Bara Imambara is a part of the heritage walk in Lucknow. And Its central hall is said to be the largest vaulted chamber in the world. I visited the place in July. November or December is a pleasant time to visit in Lucknow Uttar Pradesh. Winter is the best season to explore the heritage walk of the city. Definitely visit the Chhota Imambada and chowk nearby. Having a guide will help since the Imamabada is famous for its labyrinth. The monument is huge with a large number of staircases, so it would be a good idea to carry water and some wipes with you."
We have visited Lucknow for it rich historical culture and to experience amazing hospitality. We took a visit to Bars Imambara with the curiosity of bhool bhulaiya inside but now most of the parts this monument is closed due to weekend structure over the period of time. But I must say this is an amazing peice of architecture. A must visit if you are in Lucknow. I will not recommend to take guide for this because there is only one path which is open and anyone can follow the crowd and take a nice look of the Imambara. There is no entry fees but for camera you have to pay Rs.25/- which is decent enough.A guide will charge up to Rs.200/- for taking you all around but I will recommend not to take guide. Reaching early morning or late evening will be beneficial for photography and Lucknow looks from the top of the Imambara.
"It bespeaks of the rich architectural heritage of India. The concept, design & execution of this architectural wonder is commendable. Bara imambara complex has Bhul bhulaiya, Baoli, Maqbara & Mosque to see in addition to to the grand imambara. Taking a guide is very good idea. From the rooftop one can see several other monuments of this great city. A must-see. There're toiletes (not very clean), water as well as a small outlet selling cold drinks etc inside the complex."
"Just recently I got a chance to visit the most unique and breathtaking Lucknowâ€™s historic landmark known as Bara Imambara, which means big holy place where people gather to pray and share their religion. Bara Imambara is not only a prayer place for may people but now also one of the most visited architecture in Lucknow, it also has the only labyrinth(Bhul Bhulaiya) in the country. The construction of both the monuments are just remarkable and very well thought, they have made it so strategically that the light and wind passes through the whole Imambara perfectly and you need no other source of light or wind. They have maintained it really well, youâ€™ll get all sorts of facilities over there like water snacks and where to take off your footwear. They have carpets all around to make it easier for people to walk even if itâ€™s hot, I would highly recommend taking a guide from there itself as they tell you the whole history of the place and main stories behind the monument and what exactly was the purpose of everything it consists of. I would recommend going to this place either early morning or during the sunset to enjoy the best views and less crowd. Do cover the whole of the monument from the terrace to the ground and inside area and if you have time do cover the small Imambara as well. You should really visit this place when in Lucknow, highly recommended in winters."
It's one of the prides of Lucknow....a beautiful work of art by the Mughals. Goes with the tradition and culture of the city of nawabs and kebabs....it deserves more publicity than it gets....in fact all the old structure of lucknow need to be publicized to highlight the city's uniqueness.
"This place has a terrific atmosphere and belies all the nastiness you hear about the islam faith. People were lovely, the building is truly special with amazing acoustics, and the labrynth...OK, find out for yourself but allow plenty of time. Enjoy"
"The best place in lucknow. This imambara has three portions with separate entry tickets. 1.Bauli 2.Imambara 3. Bhool Bhoolaiya. The bhool bhoolaiya is amazing. You can easily lose your way out inside. So better to take a guide. It will take atleast 2.5hrs to cover the Bara Imambara. You can buy a combined ticket of Rs 50 which also  include entry to chota imambara, Picture gallery just within 1km of Bara Imambara. Beware of fake guides and e rickshaw drivers posing as guide as they don't have the permission to enter the monuments. official guide is available inside the monument."
Got a chance to visit this historical monument recently which has a great story behind it's architecture! Try not to go in afternoon! They have a compulsion of Guides for Couples and is in cash so no receipt for that! Which is a bad point! Other than that it's a really photographic place hence definitely a must visit in Lucknow
It is a lovely historic place. Decently maintained. Takes you back in time. It is of religious importance to many. One of the few monuments to see in Lucknow.
"I consider Bara Imambara to be the main attraction of Lucknow. Hiring guide here is must, otherwise you will not enjoy the beauty of this monument. Bhul Bhuliya is a wonderful place to visit in it."
An enlightening place this must be included on things to see in Lucknow . Allow a lot of time to visit this is a place that to be appreciated you must not hurry your visit
"This monument, built to provide employment to people at a time of famine is an architectural marvel. Do hire a guide and try to find your way through the maze. Highly recommended."
Well all of us love to visit old places and bada imambada is perfect. Love the place. Hire a guide and enjoy the whole place. Also dont belive in all the things they say. Some of the things are fake. Overall the place is wonderful.
The Bara Imambara is a highlight of Lucknow. Give yourself plenty of time to explore and donâ€™t miss the labyrinth on the roof
"All the structures in the premises are grand.The main building is full of mysterious architectures.There is a big hall about 100 meter long with no supporting pillars in between. The maze, the secret of 'Bouli' building and lot more. Explore yourself to get the excitement."
Visited Bara Imambara after a long long time.....govt has done well to maintain this historic monument but public has left no stones unturned to litter the place and scratch their love stories in stones all over. Bhool Bulaiyan is a must visit but with a guide.
Mesmerizing architecture and beautiful landscape.  Bhool Bhulaiya - A must visit place in Lucknow apart from other places in the city.  One can also go to Chowk which is at stone throw distance and enjoy authentic lucknowi cuisine
"Visiting Bada Imambara was a delightful experience. We got to witness the beautiful architecture created by The Nawab of Lucknow back then in time. There are many small small aspects present under one premises. First is bada imambada(the place where the imaams or religious gurus offer teachings), second is baoli(water storage place) and the third one is bhoolbhulaiya(the maze). All the sights are a must see once in your life."
Revisit the nawabi era of Lucknow by visiting the place. Good place to go along with your family. Bhul bhulaiya inside the building is an interesting thing to visit
"A must visit place in Lucknow.A wonderful place. Take a guided tour of bhool bhulaiha.The weather was awesome when we were there yesterday.Thanks,Ravi"
"Do spend a lot of time here, definitely a place for history lovers.  The bhul bhulaiya does get crowded, but definitely worth it."
Being the evening time it was pretty crowded . But it is worth a visit nevertheless . It houses the Bhul Bhulaiya for the adventure seekers . The garden in front is well maintained . It is a large complex and houses other structures too .
This place is absolutely magnificent. The architecture of this monument is amazing. Take a government approved guide to show you around this place. I the labyrinth is definitely a place to try. The place is clean and we'll maintained by the authorities. It's so peaceful and one should definitely visit this place
This is a must visit in Lucknow. Go early on a holiday as it gets crowded during the latter half.Bhul bhulaia and baoli are key not to be missed attractions.
Baradhan Imambara also known as Asafi Imambara. Very prominent land mark in the city. Built by Awadh Nawab Asafud Doulah in 1784. It has WORLDâ€™S LARGEST ARCHED HALL WITHOUT PILLARS. One of the architectural wonders of that time. It has got the mysterious maze called Bhul Bhulaiya on the top floor which creates a puzzle with an array of interconnected passages and balconies. Visitors MUST venture inside only with authorised guides.
Visited this place after a long time with some friends and we enjoyed a lot. A must visit destination in lucknow. You can actually feel the old nawabi style. The Grandness of the hall and exhibits are good. What a feeling to be at Bara imambara( bhool bhualiya).
Beautiful place to visit. Enjoyed a lot in searching the way out . Really a Bhull bhulaiya ðŸ˜‚. Also found the place where late Sridevi shoot the Mom movie . ðŸ˜Š
"HiOne must visit this place If you visit to Lucknow than one must visit this place and guide was very good to explain in details about the place and told about its history and how this was built.In this one area is bhul buleya which is something special. In that whenever you want to go out than there are four ways and three are wrong and one is correct. If you go in wrong place than you move there only and cant come out from this place.Further once you see from inside window you can see more than 100 meter outside which vehicle or person is moving on road, which they used to know about if any person is coming from there and outside person will not know whether any onr is seeing him. And on the same line if you lighting the match stick it can been heard other side. Hindi me kahavat he ""Deewaro ke bhi kaan hote he""Good place and when you go to Bawri and you go almost 50 stair case down and from the water level you can see who is on road. Beautiful artitech and place is also neat and clean.Overall good experiance to us."
"The buildings in this complex are interesting in design. The great assembly hall is a large hall unsupported by any pillars. Take the steps up and explore the labyrinth and see how this architectural feat was achieved. The surrounding area is also very interesting with lovely buildings and gateways. It's a very pretty area.Entrance was 500rupees and you must have a guide.Shoes off to explore. The mosque was only open for pryaers, not visitors."
Basically it is a tomb.actually visited on 29th of October. It reflects navabi old culture. Is is 1+ 2 story structure. Ground floor has rooms of three jihadee members of then navab.then there is bhulbhulaiya where we really lost our way. View from 2nd floor was lovely.we could see sky line of Lucknow from there. Sanctity of the place is well mai trained It is kept very clean.
"The grandest of grand! An impressive compound that highlights the power of the Nawabs of the time. The beautiful gateway ushers you in to an open space where there is gardens and then to the left a gorgeous masjid. We didn't pay for the tour inside the labrynth, was turned off by the crowd, however we were here on a public holiday. Go later in the day to see the colours of the orange brick change for some wonderful photos.If you're a Westerner though be prepared to be asked, unfortunately often rudely, for loads of photos of you."
it is built in vast area. moghal architecture. inside you have BULBULAIYA. climbing the steps is difficult if you are aged. lot of steps at every place. you tend to forget the way out. old well doez not have water but you could see your shadow from top. marvellous architecture though if is of no use today.Nearby you have Rumi Gate. from one side it looks moghul architecture and from the reverse it is indian. good to look around.
"There are three things to see in bada imambada - baoli, bhul bhulaiya and imambada. Hiring a guide is must to enter bhul bhuliya. The rate of guide is fixed and depends on number of persons. Photography is allowed everywhere."
"If you are looking for an archaeological site her you should come. Making of this site is completely different from any other space in India, you can feel the vibes of vintage Lucknow"
Bhool bhulaiya is good and must visit. Architecture wise nice to see but getting worn off. Go atleast once if you have time in Lucknow. I dont think so you will remember any history but a guide is a must
