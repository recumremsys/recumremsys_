very well maintained road and the waterfalls are awesome. need to visit there once more.must c place in thrissur. u need to go t the waterfalls to feel the breeze
Walking down and then back up on the cliff from this amazing waterfall site is worth an experience. Whether it be beauty of the nature or enjoying a trekking like (relax! not exactly trekking) visit to this place is a must if you are anywhere within 100 kilometers fromâ€¦
"Exceptionally beautiful and ofcourse bewildering. Visited long back.Visit the  falls after a period of good rains in Kerala. During Onam holidays, one should expect lot of crowd. There are resorts available around. vazhachal which is nearby is also is very beautiful. Both areâ€¦"
"a quck getaway from cochin , a short walk from the main road to see this amazing sight . do walk down to the base of the falls there is a slippery marked trail , best avoided by people not in shape . the view from there is fabulous & you get drenched . also take time to drive down further to cherpu falls bang on the main road"
Such a beautiful view. Was divine. But was a long walk to the bottom of the waterfall. Was worth all the effort. Just a kind note. Don't wear a saree and go hiking. ðŸ˜Š
"Had  good time with friends.  Evenings are very pleasant.  Riverbath was chilling.  Fun place, totally loved it"
"An amazing place. Best water falls in Kerala. But, you have to be very care full as the number of accidental deaths increased recently. do not try to get in to the water."
"Beautiful water falls, it will be terrific when there is more water flowing. Well maintained surroundings. Safe for families with children but need to monitor. Getting down to the base is made easy but not for elderly people because climbing back will be treacherous. Enjoyableâ€¦"
"The Bahubali falls are mesmerising and a must visit. However don't rush the tour. Take a relaxed break, enjoy the serenity of the forests and reach well in time near the falls. The entry to the falls closes at 5pm. It's a long walk down. People who have difficulty in walking mayâ€¦"
We were here last month to take a sneak peek at the famous waterfall scene from bahubali and it did not disappoint. It takes a bit of hike to visit this place. Make sure to carry a waterbottle as the hike can make you tired and thirsty.
"Tell people about your experience: describe the place or activity, recommendations for travelers?Best months to visit July middle to September end. Avoid plastic"
"One Of The Awesome Water Falls In Kerala, A Must Visit.  The drive is you take a turn from Chalakudy and it is about an hour windy roads, so take extra care. Nice food on the way that you stop and have.  Beware of the wild monkeys, they will attack you if you have food in yourâ€¦"
"If one is fascinated with Niagara falls, but Athirapally, during monsoon is no less than a Niagara! But beware that to experience the real feel, one needs to climb down a steep one kilometer path which takes you to the bed of the falls. It was a thrilling experience - to see the huge splash of water and the sprinkles of droplets raising as clouds all over. There are three rainbows formed just before us and it was mesmerizing. Beware of parking - during season, there would be so many vehicles and it would be diffuclt to park."
The waterfall is as beautiful as Nigeria waterfall also known as Nigeria waterfall of Kerala. The view was truly amazing and thrilling. Is one of the best waterfall from India.Truly refreshing place to visit.
Beautiful waterfall. The mist rising from the fall  sets a heavenly atmosphere. Parking is a little bit of an issue as there are lot of tourists in the rainy season. Tickets close at 5 pm. Evening time view is really beautiful. One can go down to the bottom of the fall through aâ€¦
Visited this place recently. Travelled via Valparai. The drive was as usual thrilling and long. But could not make it before 5.00 pm to the falls. Reached at 5.15 pm. The ticket office 200 m away from the entrance to the falls was closed and any amount of pleading did not heedâ€¦
"The place is awesome. Not allowed to go near falls but you can play in backwater. Its a nice experience. Visited in april, it was too humid. Yet good experience."
"Visited early morning and walked not only at the top but also down to the bottom of the falls. Very popular place with newly weds as they have their photos taken with the falls as a backdrop. Cost to enter was 100 rupees for foreigners and 30 rupees for locals. If you struggle to get up or down paths then Iâ€™d suggest not going down to the bottom of the falls. Although there are seats to rest along the way, in heat, with steep slopes and not a particularly good path, you will struggle. That said itâ€™s worth the trip. Downside - the locals appear not to appreciate the area, as it is strewn with old clothes as they swim in the water and used nappies which brings the area down - shame as it is a beautiful natural tourist attraction."
Visited the falls with my baby and she liked der very much. Please note there are many monkeys so keep the food and juices very safe. After January the water was on shallow level so V could enjoy well without much crowd. The drive was awesome.
"Well this is one the spot you shouldn't miss while in keral. It's almost 70 km from main Kochi and takes almost two hours to reach from Kochi.I along with my friends travelled in big traveller. Well I 'll advise to take a private cab. I am not sure about the public transport.When you reach there, beware of the monkey's all around. They won't hesitate to jump on anything that you have which they feed upon. It advisable not to give any attention to them. Just keep walking with your belonging intact. While you take a walk for a while, you will find that there are two paths for the hi fall and each path leads to different side of the fall. Easy path is  simple one and will lead straight to the fall. You can see the catchment. You can the see the water falling from you level of your feet. You will observe the stream from the fall, making its way through the jungle and green jungle mountains and sky in the horizon. If the sky is cloudy, it would be mesmerising. I had one same view. In the catchment at back, you can find people bathing in fresh water. Well don't hesitate to join them. But beware of the flow of water and don't go in deep. While my friends had been in bathing, I rather chose to sit around, clicking pictures for them. Other way leads is kinda trail that will lead you to the foot of fall. Once you reach the foot of falls , just climb on the small rocks towards the fall(be very careful), and just feel the tiny droplets of water splashing against you. Trust me. Forget about your camera pictures and phone. Just forget for a while and sit and enjoy the fall. Well , the feeling when the splashed water droplets falls on you, is something I still carry with me today. And without that feeling , this trip would be vain. Ps: the trail is bit tiring especially when it comes to trekking back to upside but it's not something impossible. One must just do  it. And be cautious.All the best guys. Enjoy."
One of the best waterfall to visit. Nothing best to visit this heaven during monsoon as i went in aug2017. Went by private car. Have to trekk down in narrow lane with monkeys roaming. And finally the waterfall at such a small distance. Soak urself with the water splashing fromâ€¦
"This is one of Indias great waterfalls and is majestic in its way. Reaching this place could be a challege ad its quite a hike. If you have senior citizens then think about t again. coming to the water fall, its a great view. You can let you hair down and play in the water. Itsâ€¦"
"Awesome, wide and great waterfall of the region.  Must visit. Parking for vehicles is 1/2 Km away from the the site."
Must visit place in Kerala those who love nature and itâ€™s wild beauty.. athirappilly water falls is one of the best water fall I have ever seen.. the place is developed and GOVT. Check post and security feel give you secured feeling for a get away with family.
"Location: Mapped well to reach. Take your own car/cab for ease of moving about.  Ticket: Entry ticket needs to be purchased, carry change Food: Carry water with you and some light snacks Tips: To get to the bottom of the falls, there is a bit of trek needed, wear comfortableâ€¦"
"We had a great day out visiting these falls. Wear decent shoes for the hike down the stairs and over the rocks to the full view of the falls.  We also had a swim upstream with many others enjoying the beautiful spot.  Watch out for the monkeys on the walk in, they seemed to beâ€¦"
"We went in July and the waterfall was full of water. Top view was majestic but the front view totally blew our mind. We just stood there silently admiring the beauty of the waterfall. Water droplets were coming after hitting the rocks as if it is raining.To reach the top view of the waterfall, you need to go down ~400 m and another ~200 m for the front view, but it was all worth it. Don't forget to take umbrella if you are going down for the front view."
Take a one set of dress ...So you can enjoy a lot. Visit during monsoon time...It'll be awesome...! Recommended location for one day family picnic.
"Didn't see this place at its most impressive because I went just before the monsoon, so water levels were very low.  At the top of the ""falls"", most of the rocks & channels were exposed. The cararact was just a small stream falling over the edge into the valley below. You canâ€¦"
It is a beautiful waterfall and the walk from Gate is nice. Be careful of the monkeys and dont carry any food or water including baby feeding bottles in your hand that might attract the monkeys attention. The drive to both athirapilly and vazhachal is a pleasant drive.
"Naturally Beautiful wild waterfall. Famous for the location of the blockbuster movie bahubali. Located in the midst of jungle but easily accessible by road. (Chalakkudi- valparai rout) entrance fee is INR 20 or 30 per person (can't remember correctly) The top of the waterfall is walkable distance from main road. But to reach the bottom of the waterfall is a bit risky way. The authorities placed the board ""the breath taking view of the waterfall will take your breath away"". So be careful and do not enter in to the water. The walkway to the bottom of waterfall is too steep and slippery, which is not appropriate for people with heart disease."
"Went for a day trip to Athirappilly.  it was a great experience.  The crowd was too much but somehow there is still space for picture taking.  They close early at around 430PM.  All in all, it was great."
"My friend and I took 3 local buses to get to the waterfalls, starting from Fort Kochi. I'd highly recommend doing this. It takes roughly 2-3 hours each way, but is a fun experience and a cool ride on the local non AC bus. Hanging out in the pools above the falls is really niceâ€¦"
