"Was the most fantastic trip of my life. The guides were superb-safe, fun, incredibly helpful. Food was great. One of the best things I have ever done for myself.Impossible to explain the life changing, heart-opening experience of a life time. Do it! and I think AZRA is the best company when it comes to safety, understanding the geology of the canyon and really going the extra mile.Went oct 22 to nov 6th. Best weather they had ever had late in the season. i loved avoiding the 110-120 degree summer days. Weather was great for hiking. Cold at night but i just put on a hat and gloves and snuggled down into my bag."
"The trip was fantastic.  Scenery unbelievable.  Guides were all very knowledgeable and capable and phenomenally hard-working.  Meals were first-rate and really hard to imagine that one could eat so well so many days into a trip.  They even created a special private dining area (complete with candle lights) for my wife and I on our 25th Anniversary which was Day 6 of the trip.Be aware though, this trip is not for the faint of heart.  The hike down Bright Angel Trail is a beast and you want to make sure you have given yourself the gift of training for it.  Every day you are up early breaking camp and setting up camp after a long day of rafting or hiking.  The silt is everywhere and though you get used to it, the chocolate colored river in the summer is a shock.  Bring clothes that you do not mind being trashed in the end.  Be prepared for all kinds of weather.  And be prepared for adventure.  It is a wondrous trip, and having the paddle boat as part of the trip was a real treat - you get to actually be a participant in the journey in the paddle boat, you are not just along for the ride."
"Absolutely amazing experience with a great company employing stellar guides. Full days on the river and/or doing amazing side hikes (tailored to individual abilities of various group members) were always bookended with great breakfasts, nutritious hearty lunches, and amazing dinners. Really, it was crazy what they could pull off 13 days into a trip without a grocery store in sight. Really diverse guides allowed you to get a big workout in, chill and watch the Grand scenery go by, and/or really learn something about the history, legends, and geology of the place. Their preparation booklet is spot-on too, read it carefully. Go with this company."
"Great guides, food, experience. I'd go again next week. Exciting, informative and a relaxed good time with friends without the intrusion of technology. Food was WAY beyond expectations when space, weight, etc. are considered for a 2 week excursion with no resupply."
"What an incredibly wonderful experience!  The guides are professional, extremely knowledgeable and care deeply that each person regardless of ability have an excellent time.  I expected that I would love the white water part which I did but also fell in love with the hiking.  Challenging - yes but to see the the beautiful canyons and their waterfalls well worth the effort.  Thank you AZRA for helping this novice enjoy the trip so deeply!"
"Could not have asked for more. Everything  was professional and fun from the staff and website info as I got ready, to the care, education, food and support from the guides while in the Canyon. The passion and skill of the Azra guides are perfect for this special place. Thank you to my friends on this trip and to our guides who made this experience so wonderful."
"The grand canyon is an extraordinary place in itself but AZRA's guides shared their love and knowledge of the canyon to create an adventure of a lifetime.  From delicious meals, hikes for all skill levels, to quiet time guitar in the most amazing of 'music halls', this trip was planned with amazing attention to detail that offered a full range of experiences to be present with all of the qualities of the canyon. Lots of laughter, excitement and stillness.  thank you AZRA. Do it - you'll never forget it!"
"Our guides were fantastic and extremely knowledgeable about the history of the river. We were on 32 foot rafts, no paddling for 1 week. It was extremely hot in June but the river provided instantrelief. The hikes we did were the highlight for me. We hiked to other small rapids, waterfalls and into the canyons for some amazing views. Sleeping under a blanket of stars was also a highlight. The food our guides cooked was delicious, truly impressive. My 1 complaint was the buses we took to and from the river were very old with no AC."
"What an amazing adventure!  I just got back from a 14 day Classic Adventure Full Canyon trip.  Words and photos cannot do justice to the beauty and fun we had.  The AZRA guides where absolutely wonderful and provided an insane amount of geological and historical knowledge about the GC and the area (we had geologists on our trip with us so they couldn't get away with wrong facts!). They made sure that every guest was taken care of and having a great time!  They got all of us to let loose and act like kids again.  The food was great!  I was shocked at what kind of meals they can make for us day after day.  No one went away hungry!  As a brand new camper, and not sure if I'd like sleeping on the ground and not showering for two weeks, I came away from the trip wanting to go again! In my book that is the highest praise that can be given.  If you can, book the full canyon trip. I found that we all hit our stride right around day 5 or so and if you book a shorter trip that is about the time you have to leave.  Plus, the canyon is so different from week one to week two that you will miss a lot of awesome and amazing things.  Book your AZRA trip now! You absolutely will not be disappointed."
"We had a great trip.Wonderful guides, great place, great outfitter.  Going to do a trip with them again as soon as I can.Bert F"
"Rafting through the Grand Canyon was spectacular!! ...and fun, exciting, challenging, exhilarating, wild and peaceful, A timeless journey deep into the heart of the earth. Highly skilled and knowledgeable guides led an amazing trip... exceeded all expectations. AZRA provides great service."
"I was amazed by how well coordinated this trip was, by the quality of the guides, by the staggering beauty of the place. I lead retreats all over the world and this was the most well run beautiful trip I have ever taken. Thank you."
"This trip is fantastic for people who love being outdoors, don't mind roughing it (think sleeping on the ground and pooping in a bucket!), want to see some of the world's most stunning scenery, and enjoy a physical challenge (hiking and paddling). The guides are super knowledgeable,smart, funny, skilled, sensitive and work beautifully as a team. They also can cook delicious camp food. Prepare to be wowed. Bring as little as possible other than hat, sunscreen, quick dry clothes and a sense of adventure and you will have the experience of a lifetime!"
"Had a great time on our raft trip through the Grand Canyon.  Guides were great and very helpful.  Food was super especially when considering conditions under which it was made.  Scenery unbeatable and guides offered lots of info on history, rock formations and such.  Highly recommend for a get-a-way from everyday humdrum."
"Had the most incredible time rafting down the Grand Canyon with Azra! All the guides were absolutely fantastic, they hugely exceeded my expectations! Their knowledge of the history and geology of the canyon was amazing- I expected them to be knowledgeable on the river considering it was a white water rafting trip, but the extra information about the Grand Canyon was so interesting and really made the whole experience for me. The guides were all so friendly, easy to talk, fun and great chefs! The food was phenomenal- we had steaks on our 4th night on the river! The variety of food we had over the 6 for breakfast, lunch and dinner was fantastic! And we had fresh fruit and salad!Steve was our paddle boat guide, we spent 3 out of the 5 days on his boat and he was great- competent, knowledgable, fun and friendly! We spent the other 2 days on Kevin and Howie's oar boats and they were also really great, they've been on the river for years and knew so much about it and told us so many stories, it was so interesting hearing about it all! The other guides on our trip- Larry, Betsie and Dave were all really friendly too! We had lots of fun in the evenings socialising with the guides and the other guests on the trip. I would highly recommend this company for your Grand Canyon white water rafting trip!"
"If you are planning a float trip on the Colorado go with AzRA! From start to finish the trip was perfectly executed - full of fun, great food, wonderful people (guides and guests!), and of the spectacular scenery of the Grand Canyon!We took a 10-day motor trip through the full canyon (8/26-9/4). I believe AzRA offers a 8-day but I would definitely recommend 10 days as there is so much to see and do 8 days would not be NEAR enough!  Having time to get off the boat and hike some of the side canyons was an absolute must!Our trip leader was Ed Hasse, a veteran boatman with 30+years experience on the river, assisted by his wife Sandra and assistant Steve. Ed led our motley crew through miles of spectacular scenery, fantastic hikes and joyful rapids, always keeping us safe, informed and engaged. A river trip is a great experience for all ages. Our trip ranged between 30-70 years old, but everyone was active and up for great hikes and experiences. The camping is luxurious to those with backwoods experience but pretty rustic for those who are more used to ""car camping"" ie. flush toiliets, showers, etc. Be prepared to bathe in 48 degree water, pee in the river and sleep on the ground! These things might sound impossible to first-timers but they are in fact part of what makes this trip such a memorable experience. Talk about getting away from it all and out of your comfort zone!!The team worked tirelessly to provide fantastic meals that accommodated everyone's tastes and diets. You will not be hungry!!  There are 3 solid meals a day plus snacks and electrolyte drinks/juice/water available all the time!! We checked out some of the other river trips spreads at some popular lunch spots and AzRA's was 10x better!!! :) The rapids are fun but not at all scary on the motor rig. However you will be very wet (which is sometimes great and sometimes freezing)!! The hikes are always optional but I wouldn't miss them if you can help it. There are some amazing sites hidden in the canyon which you can't see from the boat! Depending on the group your guide will really customize the trip so each trip is unique. I will definitely plan to go again as one trip only scratches the surface of what Grand Canyon has to offer and I will definitely go with AzRA!"
"The Upper Canyon all paddle trip was full of adrenaline, adventure, and awe-inspiring beauty.  We paddled down the Colorado River in synchronized strokes to the tune of churning water.  Flanking red cliffs of ancient stone soared towards the sky. Sometimes the river was serene and peaceful.  Other times, it was turbulent and angry.  We embraced nature around us and experienced the wonder of the Grand Canyon.The tour had 18 guests (6 paddlers / boat x 3 boats).  The guests ranged in age from 30's to 70's with an average age near 60. There were 6 staff members (3 raft guides and 3 support staff in 3 oar boats).  The trip was incredibly well-organized.  The staff was professional and very experienced.   Guides were knowledgable, hilarious, and entertaining.  A typical day: 5:15AM coffee call5:30AM breakfast call (scrambled eggs, toasted bagels, bacon)6:30AM pack up sleeping bag, tent, dry bags, load rafts7:00AM BJ (trip leader) whips out map and corny jokes.  Lectures about rocks and history.7:30AM-8:00AM paddle11:30AM stop for lunch (sandwiches or wraps)12:30PM paddle2:30PM go hiking up a side canyon (see waterfall or petroglyphs)3:30PM raft5:00PM set up camp6:00PM eat dinner (marvelous food!  Steak and mashed potatoes.  Ravioli and garlic bread.  Chicken fajitas.  Freshly baked carrot cake.)7:00PM stories or singing9:00PM sleep under the stars (or in a tent)AZRA is a reputable company with outstanding guides and staff.  The equipment is top quality.  (Tents and sleeping bags are new this year.)  Food was better than what I eat at home.   I loved the trip and highly recommend AZRA for your Grand Canyon rafting adventure.  Forward paddle!"
"Our trip started with not the best of weather. But our fantastic group of knowledgeable, professional, and super supportive guides kept our spirits up!  Joy, Kevin, Brad, Jacob, Matt, and Tess are the best. The sun came out and our trip was superb. Had a perfect run going thru Lava falls in a Dory !  Exciting rapids, great food & camp sites, and wonderful stories & history along the way."
"well run, exciting, diverse experiences (rafting, hiking, swimming, nature), excellent foodnote that this is not for the weak or fussy-- it's camping for 9 or 15 straight days without bathing opportunities.  Laundry in silty brown river water really doesn't work very well.  Heed the warnings about foot care, they also apply to your backside and hands.  Be sure your underwear doesn't have seams around the bikini line or anywhere on the backside where they will chafe when sitting on a convex hard rubber surface all day.For better health, bring fresh dry clothes for each day, lots of wet-wipes, and pay the $$ to have your stuff delivered by mule at the beginning/end."
"Spending 14 days rafting thru the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River with AzRA was a life changing experiences,  The beauty  of the canyon can only be appreciated by being there.  The slower pace thru the canyon allowed us to experience many side canyon hikes.  The guides have outstanding knowledge of geology and historical knowledge of life in the canyon. The rapids are only a small part of experience.I went during the rainy season so had some spectacular waterfalls coming over the side canyon walls. The river was a little brown, so I would recommend taking tan colored clothes to wear. Don't forget a camera in a waterproof case or a waterproof camera.If you have the time it is well worth taking  the longer Hybrid or Paddle raft trips thru the Canyon as you  have so much more time to experience all the canyon has to offer.The AzRA Guides are caring and a ton of fun plus excellent cooks.I hope to return again on of these years"
"Loved the whole trip with Randy, Dave and Erin as our thoughtful, and knowledgably generous crew... happy to have experienced such a wonderland of rapids, terrain and exceptional hikes with waterfalls.  My family of four enjoyed the 7 night 8 day trip of a lifetime together and I will definitely recommend such a trip to my friends."
"Did a 8 day motorize river run program thru Roades Scholar and NASU.  Was probably the best experience of my life. The rapids were fun but the Canyon experience touched my soul. We had amazing river guides with Jed and Erin. Food was better than most high class restaurants. The knowledge and love of the canyon shared with us by these two individual cannot be measured. I know this review sounds ""touchy, feely"" and I am not normally that ""type"" of guy but this was special. My favorite times were shutting off the boat, drifting, floating and sucking in the ""full Canyon experience"". The rapids while fun and what initially attracted me is not what got me or what I am walking away with. The initial part of the river run thru the inaccessible Marble Canyon was an ethereal experience."
"The AZRA guides might not be Houdini but they sure will help you escape to one of the most incredible places on earth.Breathtaking scenery, world class whitewater are key ingredients in this adventure recipe.This is really ""trip of a lifetime"" and you have a choice if outfitters. I choose AZRA for my second trip.....Big ol shout out to Owen (trip leader), Andrew , Alexa, Liam, John, Alan and Kevin. Thank you for helping make some life memories.Steve T"
"Been down the Grand Canyon now twice with AzRA, great people. The food well just great. The guides , great cooks and very knowledgeable about the the canyon and all the people that have been there before us. I liked the motor trips best, one week was all my old body could take."
"You can be in the parade of life or watch it go by. A trip for all who love some excitement surrounded by the most incredible setting you could imagine.Third trip with AZRA and it just  gets better each time. It's like any trip, better with friends and loved ones. Sometimes it's hard to get everyone to go at the same time. Just go, really just go. I've gone three times with these guys, two solo, you will make some great friends on your trip.Their guides are the best in the business. BIG OLD SHOUT OUT to Dirk, Jody, Michele , Claire, Jed and Aaron. Thank you ! Steve Thomas"
"On our way home after an amazing 15 day full canyon trip.  Indescribable what we experienced!  The boatmen were so professional and personable.  I was quite hesitant about my lack of experience in white water, but our crew was incredible in their ability to put me at ease.  Food was amazing, whitewater was exhilarating, and the company of fellow travelers was wonderful.  I cannot say enough about AzRA!  Thank you for truly a life changing vacation!  (Believe what you read about the sand - it gets everywhere, so plan accordingly.  Pack light and enjoy the journey)."
"This was our 2nd trip with AZRA.  Our 1st trip was non-motorized.  Both types are outstanding adventures.  Our trip leader and crew were skilled, attentive, knowledgeable and FUN!  They work hard to make sure every guest can participate in activities at their comfort level.  Food!?!  It's tasty, and there's plenty of it.  You will not go hungry.  It's one thing to stand at the rim of Grand Canyon and look it over.  It's another to experience Grand Canyon from the Colorado River and see all of the geological layers that create its rugged beauty.  On our trip (April 18 - 27) we observed migratory birds, bighorn sheep, flowering cacti, and other blooming wildflowers.  If this is one of your bucket list items, start planning ASAP.  Trips fill up fast.  If you have kids, this makes a great family vacation.  Young and old will have a blast on, for many, this once in a lifetime adventure.  Choose AZRA - you won't be disappointed."
"It is hard to know where to start, but this trip was way more than the sum of it's parts. When we started the trip, I was expecting to go rafting for 2 weeks, but was not anticipating so much more. The desert sky at night, waking early to watch the black canyon walls dissolve into textures and then colors. Camping on the beach under the stars with an incredible sand storm one night, great hikes, and swims on side canyons, checking out the slot canyons, and jumping off cliffs. Acting like a kid again. The guides were fantastic, the food was great, and the rafting was good too!. Got to paddle and row as much as I wanted, but the guides kept me from getting into too much trouble. Views from the groover! Did I mention the camaraderie, fun and games, hanging with the guides having a beer or two in the evening, listening to great stories.......... Rafting with the legend Randy Tucker, incomparable Bev, Katie as team leader, Dasch rowing sweep, and Jody as captain of Caballo Blanco. A wonderful experience I would recommend to anyone. And AzRa - they are the best!"
"I'm a 50ish yr old avid hiker/skier who usually does self guided trips.  Not having rafting skills my husband booked a full canyon trip with AZRA and filled it up with our friends.  So with 17 kindred spirits we started down the the Colorado.  Ours guides were knowledgeable, competent, personable and fun!.  Sleeping out under the stars for 14 nights was a unique experience.  Where I live in the Yukon we can rarely do that due to insects.  There were none there and I found I loved watching the stars glide across the night sky.  The river keep us interested every day with big  rapids and interesting side hikes.  It was one of the best  trips of my life."
"The Grand Canyon doesn't need a review.  Considering a rafting trip? It's the experience of a lifetime if you 1) want beauty and excitement 2) don't mind sleeping on the ground 3)aren't grossed out by peeing in the river and 4) don't mind defecating in a portable toilet that then rides in the rafts with you every day. If you are still on board, the experience with Azra was superlative.  Amazing guides - not just knowledgeable and technically superb, but genuinely interested in the guests and supportive of our  strengths and cognizant of our fears, getting us through rapids and up on rocks to waterfalls.  As someone afraid of ledges and edges, they helped me get through on most of them, and left someone with me, and others, when it wasn't our cup of tea.The guides are knowledgeable in everything from wilderness medicine to geology to archeology to group process!Azra's website, packing lists, etc were perfect.  A fantastic two weeks of beauty, learning, exercise, friendship."
"The 14 day trip is a glorious way to experience the Grand Canyon, and so much more than a river trip. You may think you are going for 14 days of a whitewater, hiking, and sleeping under the stars adventure, but turns out you will never be the same. The AzRa guides are amazing. Their passion and knowledge is apparent in so many ways that make the trip special. Getting to know them is a highlight of the trip. As you descend through the geological layers of time, the canyon seeps into your soul with stories, music, poetry, humor and just silence. Travelers initially hesitant to paddle and row are soon confident and happy to jump in. The guides knew just when to add frivolity, whether a swim in the Little Colorado with life vest worn like diapers or a birthday cake lit by a furnace of propane, but could create sublime moments with music to underscore the unfathomable stretch of time in the walls of a slot canyon. New friendships are created and old ones deepened. It is a magical 14 days."
"Traveling on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon is like a visit to another planet and 15 days was barely enough to time to scratch the surface of the place. It was easy to imagine the surroundings as the ruins of a giant civilization and the scale is so enormous that it's hard to wrap your head around. Our guides tired their best though and I'm certain we had 6 of the strongest, smartest, most experienced boatmen on the river at our service for the duration of the trip.  They gave us endless opportunities and assistance  to participate in breathtaking adventures while steering us away from those that were better avoided. They educated us, rowed us, cooked great food for us, shared great stories and generally passed along their passion for this amazing place. The trip was expertly coordinated, especially considering that conditions changed from minute to minute and there was no predicting what might happen next. Pre and post trip information was abundant at all the right times and all our endless questions were cheerfully answered by Azra. Nothing I can write will come close to describing the singular experience of the trip.  Many thanks to Matthew, Neal, Tess, J. Palmer, Brad and Lynn and everyone who helped make this an experience of a lifetime."
"This was the trip of a lifetime.  A nice balance of daily rafting, hiking and checking out slot canyons.  Being down in the canyon and riding through the layers was indescribable.  Just so beautiful.  Our fellow trippers were great and we shared many laughs during our time together. The guides were absolutely wonderful! Their experience in reading the rapids was evident and our confidence in our guides never wavered.   Each brought their own set of talents.......storytelling, geology of the Grand Canyon, guitar playing,  ""power stripes"" and stick on tattoos 😊,   The food was good and always plentiful.  Each morning, after breakfast, our head guide gave a rundown on the day's activities.  Time passed very quickly.  The camping sites were always interesting, mostly sandy but on rock ledges 2 evenings.  The 16 days on the river flew by and I started this trip being quite nervous about rafting the rapids!!  If you enjoy learning and being in the great outdoors this is a trip for you.  Some of the hikes involved exposure and you should be aware of this on certain days if you have height issues.  A waterproof camera is great on this trip.  Clothing is very much season dependent.  This was an October trip and I would say to keep the cotton clothes for camp with quick dry clothes on the rafts.  Rain coat with sleeves and necks that you can cinch down as water does get up your arms on some rapids.  I recommend light gloves on the rafts for holding on and preventing your knuckles from being rubbed and sore."
We just completed the upper canyon trip with AZRA.  What an amazing trip!  The lead guide Tom O’Hara was great as was all the other guides and assistants.  We went on an all paddle trip - it was much more exciting than just riding on an oar boat or taking a motorized trip.  We were a bit concerned about the hike outbon Bright Angel trail in the heat of the canyon but AZRA fully prepared us - it was a piece of cake and stunningly beautiful.  Thank you AZRA!
"ARZA took care of every detail in the most professional fun fantastic way from being to end. I was totally impressed. Being a bit faint of heart we took the 8-day motorized boat trip with a group of 19 and five guides that were all so interesting experienced and amazing fun folk. Jay Summer Betzy Andy Emma. Started at Lees Ferry -226 miles of really fun rapids- lava falls the biggest but so many more in between big and small. Scenery was out of National Geographic as we rolled down the river stopping multiple times a day at points of interest and challenging hikes. We definitely pushed our limits with hikes involving climbs up and over rocks 1.8 billion years old and as big as a car and shimming inches along ledges and sheer cliffs. Our guides were always right there to verbally or physically help you get to the other side. Don't get me started on the food-never would you get hungry as a delicious meal was right around the next rapid it seemed. NY strip steaks cooked medium rare, full blown thanksgiving meal with mashed potatoes gravy stuffing cranberry sauce, breakfast maybe bagels and lox with fresh lemon slices, capers or biscuits sausage gravy eggs cooked to order and the best cowboy coffee you'll ever have. I could hardly wait for the coffee call in the very early mornings.Beautiful campsites to see the Milky Way and as many shooting stars your slowly closing eyes could ever see. Bit of advice- take half of the clothes you pack. You wear the same stuff all the time. Bring biodegradable soap and rinse your clothes out hang to dry (although we went aug and can't speak for May etc) as the hardest part was rifling through your dry bags.Yes the water is freezing and you get used to it. Take advantage of the waterfall hikes and bathe / rinse your hair but no soap!We waited almost two years for this trip....it was magical.....wish I was still there."
