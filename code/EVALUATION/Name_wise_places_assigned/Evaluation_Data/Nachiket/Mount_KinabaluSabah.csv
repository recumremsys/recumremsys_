"I booked 3 days 2 nights climb with Amazing Borneo Tours. It was my first mountain climb and it was the most beautiful, special, magical and difficult adventure of my life. I consider myself to be in a good shape, but the altitude really affected my physical condition. Luckily I invested in a good pair of hiking boots, which was a big advantage. I was picked up at noon at my hotel. We went to Kinabalu National Park for the registration.Next morning we were brought by bus to Timpohon Gate (1866m), where we started the ascent each one with a private mountain guide. On our way up to Laban Rata Hostel (3272m) where we were supposed to sleep, we passed several shelters, where we could have a rest and eat lunch. In Laban Rata I started to feel a slight altitude sickness late afternoon. After dinner I went to bed, but I couldn't sleep properly, as I slept in a dormitory, where people were constantly entering the room, so I ended up getting only a few hours sleep, before getting up at 2 am, climbing the last part of the mountain in order to reach the summit before sunrise.This was one of the toughest parts of the climb, also considering the fact that my expensive gloves got wet, so my hands were freezing. On some particularly steep sections I had to haul myself up specially strong ropes. The view at the summit was simply spectacular. Looking down on the clouds was so awesome. An unforgettable million- dollar moment. The descent was difficult, but I was happy that I got hold of 2 walking sticks which helped me a lot. The climb was magical, starting at the lowland rainforest of the tropical zone, to the temperate zone until the last and alpine climate zone. Experiencing such different vegetation was truly special and unique.However, I wasn't satisfied with my guide, who was unmotivated, disinterested and unknowledgeable about the flora. I inquired a specific mountain guide prior to my climb, and I was promised to be provided with him.I paid a lot of money for the climb, and I didn't get neither a knowledgeable, nor a social/motivated mountain guide. I consider at least 3 important aspects of being a good mountain guide. The social, the psychological and the knowledge about the vegetation and wildlife. He seemed to be more occupied with his cell phone. A couple of times he told me to go ahead, and then he would catch up. He caught up after a couple of hours which isn't acceptable at all. When we made breaks at the shelters, he would sit in another place, as if he couldn't care less. I mentioned these aspects to him, but still he didn't change his behavior. He didn't know anything about the vegetation, which was very disappointing to me, as I am a true Nature Lover.  A mountain guide should always be beside the climber to give her/him the sufficient psychological support/encouragement, as it is a tough climb.In spite of this disappointment, I highly recommend the climb to this spectacular and sacred mountain. I felt satisfied with the length of the experience. You can also book the 2D/1N climb. I suggest NOT to climb the mountain in the rainy season, as the rocks get very slippery."
"We did a 3D2N climb to the summit. Was an amazing expereince. The climb was tough, but people and facilities were good along the way and the views from the top were stunning."
Great arrangement with personal pickup from your accomodation. We did the climb over 2 days with one night on the mountain.  We were both in good physique  but had a tough time the last hour on the first day. It is worth every single step to the summit. The views are truly breathtaking and it is amaizing to see how the nature changes the higher you get. Up is hard down is harder  One more thing. Prepare for aching muscles from hell a few days after you get down again. But over all. Worth every single step.
"We did the 2d1n climb and booked with Amazing Borneo Tours. Highly recommend them as they were great and very professional, we received heaps of information prior the trip so we felt well prepared. I was very nervous about the climb itself as I had never done anything like it before and I am also a bit scared of heights. The four hour climb up to Laban Rata and the accommodation was hard. I thought this part was going to be fairly easy but it is steps all the way up as well as rocks...exhausting. Arriving to the accommodation and having the staff there bring you a cup of hot tea was the best. Waking up at 2 am for early supper, the rain was pouring down. The climb to the summit cannot take place if it is raining so we had to wait another hour before the ranger gave his ok to go. (There is a 3.30 cut off).This climb usually takes 2-3 hours, but as it was slippery after the rain we had to walk slowly. I was worried about this bit, especially about climbing in darkness. (BYO head torch). It was actually amazing. You have ropes all the way up basically and yes, it does require some serious use of both arm muscles (for holding on to the rope and pull yourself up) as well as leg muscles.Reaching the summit was amazing, what a feeling sitting up there and watching the beautiful views. Stunning!Going down from summit was not a problem, however, after breakfast the four hour descend to the gate was hard. Legs aching and it felt like it was taking forever getting down.All in all, highly recommended this climb. Yes it is hard, yes it is a bit scary climbing in darkness, but the reward up there makes it worth it and the feeling you have after accomplished it is amazing. Make sure to bring lots of snacks to keep energy levels up and extra set of clothes in case of rain."
"We did it fantastic 2 day climb we had prepared well and took advice on equipment, It was far more challenging than we thought but great fun. TIP read up about mountain, take correct clothing &equipment, wear Marino wool base layer for summit v cold. Going down is harder than going up !!!!  PS We are both in our fifties &first climb for us !!"
Climbed for the 7th times and still it was very exciting especially when you go there with friend! The only thing we don't like is the weather (raining) which no one to be blame for this. Highly recommend for all traveler who like adventure and ready to be physically and mentally challenge by the Mt Kinabalu. Book your trip now (safest 5-6 month ahead) and enjoy the hike!
"It is kinda hard to get to low peak, but I made it! Remember the journey, also hiking in the dark. Switch off the headlight, lay down on the mountain and enjoy the stars. It is not all about the destination but also the journey. Enjoy the journey, once in a life time."
Absolutely beautiful hike! Gripping at times and felt like I was dying because the altitude did me in but what an amazing view. Tranquil and serene. Would do it again if I had the chance despite my panic at having to shimmy across a cliff edge.
First time visiting our local mountain and it was majestic. Would loved to have climb it but restrained due to long knee injuries.Made a point to stay nearby in Kundasang and watch its beauty. Heard you have to be well prepared mind and body as its a challenging trail up to the summit.
"The 2D1N climb of the mountain is one of the best things I did whilst in Borneo. It is hard work, and the altitude (4000m at the summit) can be a problem for some people, but the views and the sense of achievement were completely worth it. The overnight stay in the Laban Rata is overpriced and a terrible (dorm room) night's sleep, but there's not really any way round this (unless you are extremely fit and do the whole mountain in one day). Book through Sutera Lodges - they own all the accommodation, so going through any other site will just add commission and admin fees onto your costs. We paid about Â£120 for the 2D1N package. An absolute must-do."
Memorable experience. Took the timpohon route which is 2.2km more to reach the peak. Started climbing from Laban Rata at 2.30am and arrived the peak at 5.30am to watch the sunrise. View is absolutely magnificent. Challenging climb in the dark but to have the experience of being at the peak is definitely worthwhile!
Pain afterwards in every part of my legs but it was so worth it.Stunning view from the top and a real achievement in my opinion if you finished the climb.The moment when you arrive above the clouds is hard to describe.I realised how high it was when i flew back from Sandakan and passed the mountain half way.Def. go for a good massage afterwards!!
"Loved the whole thing (well except maybe for the 6.5KM of steps)Well worth it and has to be done. If you leave kinabalu without climbing the mountain, you will forever feel like you have to returnAs I did!"
"Amazing trip to Mt Kinabalu. Day 1 of the ascend was steps and straight up from the park gate to the Panalaban Base camp. Day 2 begins at 2am from Panalaban Base camp to the summit (4095m), climbing steps, and on all fours through the boulders. Towards the top we're guide ropes where we pulled ourselves up.The weather was good, and the views from the summit were stunning. Try this highest peak in Asia at least one time, unlike other higher mountains where one can hike, walk the slopes etc. Mt Kinabalu is every step we take, we ascend a little. Its a ""vertical marathon"" you might say...."
I booked a climb online with Amazing Borneo tours. Was a very easy and efficient booking process . I was given 2 options for days I could go and once booked communication was excellent. Picked me up from my Hotel and as I was by myself I had a personal guide up the Mountain. Day one was a good hike to base camp where meals were provided and bunk beds. Day 2 started at 2am with the climb to the summit. I did suffer from mild altitude sickness but managed to summit and soon was back to normal once I descended. Descent was tougher in some respects due to fatigue bit all very well organised and safe. Highly recommended !
The climbing was amazing. You have to deal with natures great forces. Reached the summit in the early morning because the weather was not ok for the nightwalk.
"I went for th climb on 11 Aug 2013. I started at 9am from the Timpohon gate. Reached te Layan Layng Hut (2,702m) at 1.30pm. I climbed slow and it rained along the way. Had my lunch of a hard-boiled egg and some bread, because I was robbed of my piece of chicke by a squirrel!!! Reached Pendant Hut (3,289m) at 3.30pm. Rested before having dinner at Laban Rata Hut (3,727m) at 6pm. Slept from 7.30pm to 2.00am in the hut, it was very quiet except for the strong winds howling outside. Continued to climb at 2.30am to the summit, passed the last check point Sayat Sayat hut  (3,668m). Finally after some strenous climb, touched Low's Peak (4,095m) at 6.15am. Climbed back down to the hut at 8.00am. Strong winds and heavy rain came, so we waited till 11am. Started the climb down in that kind of weather. Reached the bottom at 4pm. I MADE IT!!!!"
"I climb Mount Kinabalu for the 3rd time and each time never follow group but alone with a mountain guide company. However I have to buy the climb package 2d1n from local agency but i didnt take their transfer as driving from Kota Kinabalu to Mount Kinabalu park is a breeze and very scenic view.Once registered at the Park Office, collect pack lunch from the restaurant, then joint the sic coach to Timpohon Gate. Climb start at 9.30am well somewhere around there. Dont wear thick clothing but put your sweater and long pants inside your back pack. You will sweat and feeling uncomfortable for the first 10kms. Chocolate bar and 100plus and water and fruits can be really useful. I love to stop whenever i like to take rest and takes pictures. Love those quietness and cold breezy wind and occasionally looking up to sky see the mount kinabalu top..though sometime my view covered by the foliage. Beautiful. Managed ro reach Laban Rata at 3pm and took rest and have dinner..take bath also. Next day woke up at 1am and start climb again. Wheew..what a day but the rewards was great This is a long story but I shall climb for 4th time soon."
"My first mountain climb (end of April2015 Timpohon Trail) and it was exceptionally amazing and stunning. We are just a group of 3 ladies with a mountain guide. Before my climb, i did a research on what it is going to be like in youtube and articles, but somehow was mislead by pictures and videos, as the trail route was really a painful and tough experience, for a city girl lifestyle like me. Luckily those slight running, pre-climb (about 10km/ 3days per week) did paid off. Rented a walking stick at the main gate for RM10. From Timpohon gate to Laban rata (6km), took us about 3hrs plus++, so many steps after steps and huge rocks to cross over/ Dinner, a buffet style was good, lots of variety / Rest till 2am (We got a private room in Laban Rata, just for the 3 of us, not a dorm style) / Continue our hike to the summit (2.5km), which took us almost 4hrs. During our climb to the summit, everything was too dark and we depend on our head torch to move forward. Again steps after steps. The ascend 45degree incline climb or walk i guess to the summit and the strong wind, will slow you down and my legs almost give way due to sheer exhaustion and muscle cramp. Upon reaching the summit, i couldn't believe that i reach the summit and almost cried because of both exhaustion and satisfaction feelings. The view was extremely awesome and feels like im on a cloud nine feeling, all of my tiredness seems to go away. Walking down back to the main Timpohon gate, can be very tiring as well, as we need to continue down after resting from a summit climb to laban rata to timpohon gate, all to be done in one day. Walking stick do come handy for the downhill hike. Nevertheless Im so lucky to have such a good weather, good friends and my wonderful guide (Duin Limundok) who didn't leave me behind and push me all the way to the summit. This is really a no joke climb for someone who is not so fit as me. Mental, perseverance and determination is really what i need for this climb. If given another chance, i would definitely want to hike up to mount kk again and try Mesilau Trail instead. Now i would really understand of why people would congratulate you when you reach the summit."
"of us ventured for a day climb to reach kinabalu summit. It was the second time I was doing the climb, but the first time I was trying a day climb. The day climb was fairly challenging since the rangers require that you reach Laban Rata at 12pm and the summit by 1pm. If you do not make it by then, they will require you to turn around. We rented a car at the airport and spent the night at Kota Kinabalu. Then we set off at 5am and reached the park slightly before 7am. We had not booked anything and the guides quickly settles all the paperwork. All in all, with the two guides, the park entrance and the climbing permits, it cost us about RM600 for 3 foreign persons (RM200 per person), well below the ""cheapest"" RM2,550 for 3 people quoted by the cheapest travel agency. The guides asked for a day climb permission from the rangers which was immediately granted. The climb to laban rata was grueling and seemed endless, especially the last 2km where the thinner air is being felt. The two other climbers in our group were not really prepared for this level of effort and we took quite a few to drink and rest on the way. There are plenty of rest areas on the way up equipped with toilets and water. There are signs informing climbers that the water is untreated, but we filled our bottles with it and never got any problem. We reached Laban Rata guest house at 11:30am and took a quick bite with the food we had carried with us. Looking at the derelict state of this guest house I was glad I did not stay there, especially for the outrageous price of about 800Ringgit per person. This guesthouse is rusting away with no apparent maintenance and falling apart at the seams. The inside is damp and in bad need for a deep overhaul. Yet, the owner continues charging the full monopoly pricing. Anyhow, we pressed ahead, towards the summit. The guides warned us that we were fairly late and that we may not reach the summit. MY climbing companions were exhausted and gave up about 1km after Laban Rata. They turned around with one of our guides and I pressed on with the other guide. By 1pm, I was in sight of the summit, but unfortunately, the guide asked me to respect the cut off time, so we turned around. I rejoined my climbing friends at laban rata and we all went down in two and a half hour. We did not have the time to reached the summit, still it was a magnificent day and a huge effort rewarded with a remarkable landscape. It also bolstered our friendship and teamspirit with my climbing buddies. The experienced lived on as we relived the climb over a good meal in kota kinabalu but with our tired and painful legs legs for the weeks following the climb. Also, I havent saif my last word and will be back for another 1 day climb attempt..A keenly recommended experience."
Just been there at the chrismas eve and the view was amazing! Very difficult climb for me from Laban rata to low's peak but the starry sky and beautiful sunrise worth the climbs! Takes me 5 and a half to climb to Laban rata and another 4 and a half hours to the low's peak. The total time for climbing down was 5 hours
"Did a 1-day up & down summit hike in January 2014, 3 of us paid 450RM each to an agent in KK, including everything (including TWO guides) except a night in the Mountain View Guesthouse 500m outside the park entrance (70RM for a triple room, wifi, hot shower, clean)The good:-Well-maintained, clear path to the summit-Spectacular views-Sense of achievement-Little or no rubbishThe BAD:-Rip off tour agents in Kota Kinabalu-Rip off Sutera Laban Rata Guesthouse-Completely useless guides - & we had to pay for TWO guides between 3 of us. There were no guides to be seen when we started our climb at 7:30am. One eventually did catch up with us after a few kilometres, lectured us about deadlines for the climb, then walked BEHIND us (not GUIDING us) most of the way up before he gave up close to the summit.-Rip off permit system - the 4 permits/day rule only does not apply, it is a scam to make tourists use agents (who pay off the park rangers & guarantee a permit) or book an insanely expensive 2 day/1night tour. There were 8 1-day climbers the day we climbed (4 of us made it to the summit)-Reached the summit just before 12pm, so it was somewhat cloudy - it is usually clearer in the morning"
"Good experience even though we were unlucky. Anyway based on average statistics, total closure of the summit climb happens about 10 â 15 times a year. Click the link to see what happened. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoWeQaGc3CU"
"We climb via mersilau trail, it was indeed fascinating and scenic path. It wasn't easy but was easier than the timpohon trail. Spend 6 hours to reach laban rata and had our lunch at the resthouse. Didnt really get to sleep as we were too excited. Waking up in the morning 2am to make summit hike. It was chilly due to no trees on the top and need to take deep breath as the air was thin. Nevertheless, it's all down to your determination to make it to the top. We made it before 6am :)"
"Was a local from KK, climbed mt kinabalu was my first achievement back in 2005, the experience was unforgettable for a 13yr old kid. Recently climbed again with my buddies. It was a challenging experience but worth giving a shot tho. Reaching the summit just in time to see the sunrise and enjoy view was so breathtaking, it's  so beautiful. It's really a good climb for those who appreciate nature and loves peace and quite. But of course it's very very tiring. Oh btw, you can drink the water which flows from the rock (upon climbing frm Laban rata)."
"Worth the hike for sure! Its not that tough, fairly easy, not high altitude or anything. Beautiful view from the top, very rainforresty on the path. Wear good comfy worn-in shoes you dont mind getting dirty.."
"The hike is steep upwards but with proper staircase. Not too taxing to the legs but the reducing oxygen level can be vexing to some. So things to prepare include:1. Plastic glove - the top will be cold and moist. You would't want to wet your hands and suffer cold numbness. Wear a plastic glove underneath a proper hiking glove fit cold temperature. 2. Can be hot during the day because the terrain is rather exposed so wear sunscreen or proper covering if you have sensitive skin and dont want to have darken skin. 3.  3 sets of dry clothing - shirt, thermal, track suit, socks, under wears.4. Shoes with good cushioning - going down is painful because of the staircase - you have to take big steps and often shock your knee. A good shoe helps to reduce the impact. 5. Windbreaker - The summit climb may be windy. 6. Headlamps - To be used during the summit attack often around 2am in the morning. The view is amazing - worth all the precautionary preparations."
"The first 6km up to the rest house I found easy, I'm an experienced hiker and have climbed mountains before, so that was no problem. Some people really struggled with this and got to the rest house late. It rains at about 3pm most days, so you really want to be inside by then. We saw unfit people turn upto the guesthouse after 4pm completely soaked and exhausted. So my advice is to train (a lot), run up stairs, go for long hikes, get your fitness levels up. Don't be naive, this is a real mountain, not Disney Land. The fitter you are, the more you will enjoy yourself.Secondly, take decent clothes, don't wear cotton or denim like a total numpty, wear breathable quick drying fabric to keep you cool. Start the hike in a set for hot weather, then change into a set for cold weather. Set off for the summit attempt in a base layer and wind proof and have gloves, wolly hats, fleeces and scarves in your backpack for the summit, it's really cold and windy up there, so be prepared.Thirdly, the start of the rope section is steep, if its raining, it will also be as slippy as an ice rink, proper hiking boots are required. I saw people in converse sneakers, they have no grip whatsoever! If it starts to rain when you are at the top, you will have to walk backwards holding into rope to lower yourself down steep rock faces. Like abseiling but without a harness. Some people turned back because they were scared of heights. It's only a few shorts sections, but there is a real risk of slipping and hurting yourself.The mountain upto the rope part is easy, if you are fit, just a lot of steps. The last section is a challenge and should not be underestimated. Getting down is hard in your knees, hiking poles and knee supports are good. I saw lots of people being carried down because their legs couldn't take it anymore. This is just stupid, get fit before you take on a 4000 meter mountain.It was a fabulous experience, but to get the most out of it, you must be prepared, and remember that this is a tourist attraction, but it is also a mountain. You are at the mercey of Mother Nature who can dump a biblical amount of window rain on you at any moment, so preparation and proper gear is key.Now go and get yourself fit, get down to the outdoor clothing store and get kitted out in proper gear, and get ready for an experience of a lifetime!"
Very picturesque ascend. Very natural. The guides were really fit and they can help the climbers carry their belongings with very cheap rate considering the difficulty of the climb. Around 10myr per kg. Please adhere to the instructions of the Guides. Dont forget your camera. And please ask a local for the 1myr bill as one of the peaks is on the bill. Take picture with the 1 ringgit bill at the said bill. Ask the guides and they will show you. The sunrise is just magnificently breathtaking.
"Climb up - tough but doable - beautiful sceneryClimb down - very toughGreat feeling when reaching the top. Make sure you rent a walking stick, available at the entrance (RM10) and keep you toe nails as short as possible. Needless to say that you need to be fit for this climb. Start training way in advance. Don't forget that you're going up to 4,095 mtrs - air gets thinner. Bring enough clothes so you can change. You'll have an amazing experience!"
We take the car just to have the nice sight seeing at the mountain foothill. Road is quite slippery after heavy rains. Have to pay for entrance into the park but very minimal for adult and child.
"I had a wonderful and remarkable experience in Mt Kinabalu Low Summit Climb!! Try out the mountain Torq, thrill and fun, it was awesome!!"
"I climbed it through the Mesilau trail which is so much further. The flora and  fauna were great like pitcher plants. Finally, reached Laban Rata at about 4pm. The hike was very difficult and was fully soaked with sweat. The next day started the climb at 2am. I didn't get any sleep but I managed to reach the peak at about 6 am, took photos of the sun rise. The scenery was phenomenal , breathtaking beautiful. Do some training like climbing up stairs every alternate day for 2 months. We were lucky that it didn't rain too heavily although shower of rain is expected throughout the hike, so do bring deposable rain coat."
"One of the best mountain climbing Iâve experienced so far. It is a two days one night climbing through Timpohon trail. Climbing starts in the morning at 9am from the main entrance.  If you are a spirited shutterbug, bringing extra batteries or high capacity powerbank, and a SDHC card is a must. Be ready with raincoat as it will usually rains in the afternoon. It took me much longer time to climb up to Laban Rata, (stop point for overnight) with all the photos snapping going on along the trail. Some of my friends reached Laban Rata as early as 1.00pm. All the surroundings, wildlife and lushes green & colourful flora are extremely amazing. The accommodation in Laban Rata was not luxurious as expected but the food was more than adequate. The next morning as early as 3am, we continued our climb. Be prepared with freezing temperature and make sure to bring enough warm clothing, gloves, scarf and torchlight. Manage to reach the summit before sunset but due to the clouds, the view of sunset was not that pleasant. But successfully reach to the highest peak of was one of the best feeling and feels like a great achiever!"
"mountain viewing, really cooling place but sometime can be hot. go up and see in the morning will be the good timing. those who like adventure, you can join the mountain climb with the a professional guide."
