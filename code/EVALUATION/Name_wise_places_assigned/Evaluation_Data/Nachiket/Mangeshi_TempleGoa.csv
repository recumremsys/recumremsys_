"Situated at Mangeshi village at Pirol, Ponda, Mangeshi temple is noted for the pillars which are considered to be the most beautiful among the temples in Goa. A good place to visit."
Architecture very similar to Shree Santhadurge temple near ponda. Resides on the way to Panajim from Ponda.
"The temple is a beautiful sight to your eyes. It is said that lord shiva appeared here in swayambhu linga form. All gods started coming and worshipping the linga. Once goddess parvati came to have a darshan. Lord shiva played a prank on her by turning into a tiger. Seeing the tiger the goddess shouted"" मां गिरीश पाही रक्षैव मम"" (which is sanskrit for O lord shiva protect me). Since the goddess was fearstrucken she mispronounced"" मां गिरीश "" as""मांगीश"" . Since then lord shiva is known as mangish. The temple is very beautiful and ever crowded.  There are puja shops on the way to temple. Men should wear full pants and women should wear a saree to visit this temple as guards may stop them from entering if found in improper dress but most times they are polite and let you enter. If they don't let you enter the temple for dress code rent a dupatta for 25/- from temple counter."
"The Mangeshi temple is the family deity or Kul daivat of the great Indian Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar and her family. The temple of Shri Mangesh is set amidst natural beauty and pleasant surroundings.Mangeshi, a little village along Goa’s Panaji-Ponda road is not only a point of pilgrimage for the followers of the Lord, it attracts hundreds of tourists from all over India and abroad. This temple had its origins in Kushasthali Cortalim, a village in Salcette which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started Christian conversions in Salcete district, the Saraswats of Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Aghanashini to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja district, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure.Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and yet another time in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha holy vessel was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple.The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The Peshwas donated the village of Mangeshi to the temple in 1739 on the suggestion of their Sardar, Shri Ramchandra Malhar Sukhtankar, who was a staunch follower of Shri Mangesh. Ironically, just a few years after it was built, this area too fell into Portuguese hands in 1763, but by now, the Portuguese had lost their initial religious zeal and had become quite tolerant of other religions, and so, this structure remained untouched.The main temple is dedicated to Lord Mangesh, an incarnation of Lord Shiva. Bhagavan Mangesh is worshipped here as Shiva linga. According to the legend, Lord Shiva had manifested into a tiger to scare his wife Parvati. Paravati, who was frightened at the sight of the tiger, went in search of Lord Shiva and cried out, ""Trahi Mam girisha!"" (Oh Lord of Mountains, save me!). Upon hearing the words, Lord Shiva turned himself back to his normal form. The words ""mam girisha"" became associated with Lord Shiva and over time the words got abbreviated to Manguirisha or Mangesh.He is the kuldevta or family deity of many Goud Saraswat Brahmins in Hindu community.Overall must visit destination in Goa for its sheer history !"
"We were told that Lord Mangueshi is recognized as Lord Shiva only in the regions of Goa. Shri Mangueshi Temple is situated in the Ponda Taluka at a place called Priol. The distance of the Mangueshi temple from Panaji is 22 km.Mythology says that Lord Shiva had once visited the land distraught after losing heavily to his wife Parvati at a game of dice. As Goddess Parvati came looking for him, he tried to prank her by shape shifting into a tiger and frightening her. Seeing the predator in front of her, Parvati shrieked and prayed uttering the following words Trahi Mam Grisha, roughly translated this means “O Lord of the Mountains, save me”. Upon hearing her plea Shiva reverted to his usual form and returned to Kailash with her.Shiva came to be known as Lord Manguesh due Parvati’s words Mam Grisha that remains associated with the land and the tale. The original location where the temple was built is presently the location of village Cortalim, located at the south of the Zuari River. It was during the Portuguese invasion that the deity was shifted Priol, where it remains till this day."

This temple is around 45km from panjim.I found its average place as I belong to the place where any one can find lots of temple better than this.Its simple temple. Nothing is special here. shopping area is outside the temple.
"Located at the outskirts of Ponda, this is an amazingly large temple that even includes accommodation to devotees. Ample parking space and worth the time especially if you are a tourist....then this is a must go to place."
Mangeshi temple is best place in Goa. All the tourist needs to visit this temple as it is the known temple for Lord Mangesh who is one of Lord Shiva's avtaar. The temple has best scenic views and is very much strict with regard to clothings. Women cannot enter temple if wearing short skirt or short clothes. You just enter the temple and feel completely blessed by Lord Mangesh. Do visit this auspicious place when in Goa.
"While visiting Goa, made a point to visit Mangeshi Shiva Temple. It is Situated in the village that is also famous for being the native village of melody queen Lata Mangeshkar. Like all parts of Goa, the road to templetown passes through an undulating terrain though lush green hills. Given it’s a small village, local body has made sure that cars are parked outside the village access road. This leaves the last about 500 meters to walk before one reaches the main entrance of temple. Climbing about 20 odd steps, one crosses the main gate and enters the vast grounds of temple. What surprises one is the temple architecture. Unlike a traditional temple with a pointed step tower above the sanctum sanctorum,  the temple appears like a dome of a basilica. From distance, the temple appears like a church complex. Possibly, a fusion of Hindu Temple Architecture with Portuguese history and Roman Catholic Church styles. The inner hall of temple is decorated with numerous glass chandeliers - again very different from traditional Hindu temples. Temple is however very clean and environs so soothing and serene. When visiting Goa, this should be a must visit site, just like Basilica of Bom Jesus or Se Cathedral."
Mangeshi temple is one of the tourist spots of Goa. According to people temple is more than 400 years old.This temple is situated in the Mangeshi village which is 20-21 km away from Panaji.Lord Mangesh is known to be one of Lord Shiva's avatars. Road connected from Panaji to Mangeshi is very nice.The temple is very beautiful and well maintained. Premises are quiet and peaceful.There was no queue when we visited this temple. No other attraction nearby so we returned immediately after taking darshan.There is a canteen in the premises where you will get good food in the cheapest rate. Outside the temple there are other restaurants too.Overall good experience.
"Acclaimed singers Mangeshkars native place.  Do have a look at the temple and offer prayers.  Beautifully built and it is near Ponda.  At the entrance you have place to keep your shoes.  There is a huge DeepMal around 50-60 ft.Tall.  The entire premise is clean.  Once can find many fancy items like hats, seashells, etc for sale."
"Visisted this temple as recommended by a tourist advisor.This place is crowded with people from all over the world. The scriptures are normal. Women and men should b covred from head to toe, other wise they will not be allowed to enter the temple.Recommended?Only for temple lovers. 😍"
"Good Shiva temple with very old history. This Temple was rebuilt several times after old Temple was destroyed by Portuguese rulers. Situated in Mardol town.Foreigners are allowed, but see conditions on the board at the entrance.Very nicely maintained.He is the Family deity (Kuladevatha) of many Konkani speaking people living in Goa and Karnataka.Accommodation if preferred to only community members in temple complex.Panaji and Ponda have more transport facilities to Mardol.If you don't mind the frequent rains, May to September is good. Goa looks pleasant with greenery all around. Always carry umbrella around this time.Summer is hot, feet get burned."
"Visited in March 2017. Travelled as a couple. This is the traditional temple of Mangeshkar's and is very well maintained. The temple are is quite big also they do not allow vehicles to go right outside the gate. One has to walk a little in a narrow lane to go towards the temple. The temple is beautifully made, and very clean. We did not get much crowd as it was a working day, must see if you are nearby Ponda area."
"Visited with family , this is one of the oldest temple. It is a good exponent of the Goan temple architecture... It has a walk way which is covered with a green plants and trees which gives a pleasant look...Also you can find many shops which sell a variety of things..."
"Goa is famous for beaches and churches. It also has few temples within it and Mangeshi Temple is one among them which should be in the list of ""must-visit"". The temple has huge parking area which can accommodate cars as well as buses. The way towards temple has local shops on both ways. One can get all locals things right from sweets to cloths. Just try the fruit plate of Rs.30 which they serve on some big leaf. The pineapple they serve is too good and sweet !!At the entrance you will find two-three ladies selling offering for Mangeshi Temple like coconut, flowers etc. I was surprised to see the bunch of mixed fresh flowers along with lotus as well just in Rs.10The temple is situated on the huge campus which is well maintained. You can see ""Tulshi Vrindavan"" situated between small pond. The temple is very calm and quiet, one can do chanting there and relax for sometime. Go with your friends and families and have blessing."
"This religious place is situated in South Goa. Beautiful ,peaceful amid trees adding peace in the environment. At least Knee length dress. Couldn't enter the main temple as there was a long queue.

Must visit this place if one is in Goa."

"Mangeshi temple is a little away from the usual tourist destinations. But this is around 20min drive from the Old Goa where the main churches are located and hence worth a visit, if you have time.We were asked to park a little away from temple( around 5min walk), though vehicles can go till the temple and few cars were parked there too. The road leading to temple has shops on both sides.About the temple: Very nice, peaceful atmosphere and beautiful. Functioning Siva temple. Please dress modestly."
"It is one of the famous temple in Goa. Looks beautiful, calm and serene. Must visit place if you are in Goa."
"A beautiful temple, very well kept and organised. Allows even non Hindus to visit and pay homage. A truely well organised temple, and recommend everyone to visit this temple,"
"The temple is well maintained and is beautiful. The access roads are a bit narrow and don't always allow vehicles in. The other pedestrian only path is better to walk. Local a/c taxi to Britona or Nerul is around INR 1000 during peak season on 24th December 2015. Attended a wedding, awesome food."
Mangeshi Temple .....Lord shiva in mid of natural beauty ...45 Min. Drive from Panjim but nice road view and  nice temple ....
This temple is about 10 KM's from Basilica of BOM Jesus. It is a very old temple but very clean and pleasant precincts. Deity is lord Mangesh. Open from 5.30am to 10.00 pm. Visited by many people through out the day. A must visit for all tourists.
Very beautiful Shiv temple. Well maintained temple complex. Parking area could be managed better and the approach road is narrow. I was told by security to park at parking area which is about 500m away from temple however later I found some cars going right upto the temple.
"Being a god-loving and religious man, made a point to visit this place with family!Temple was well maintained. Was not pleasant as we visited mid-noon. Scorchy sun made our visit uncomfortable.better to visit in the evening hours."
Far away from north goa. Do not go on two wheeler with child. Temple is ancient and very clean. There is facility for stay as well. It's Hindu god - shiva' s temple.
"I wished to visit this temple as it is a fine example of the typical Goan Hindu style of architecture. It is a beautiful temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Considered to be the most important temple in Goa, it is located on a hillock at Proil which is in the Ponda Taluka of Goa,about 21 km from the capital Panjim. It is one of the largest, wealthiest and most frequently visited temples in Goa.The temple was originally built in a village named Kushasthali which is now known as Cortalim, in Salcette. When Salcette was invaded by the Portuguese, the idol was removed to a safer place and later consecrated in the present location in 1560. It was a simple structure then. The present form of the temple is attributed to the rule of the Peshwas (Prime Ministers of the Maratha Empire) in the 18th century.Apart from the main deity, the beautiful white deepastambha (lamp tower), a prominent nandi bull statue and the temple tank, believed to be the oldest part of the temple are highlights of the temple complex.The complex also has shrines of Goddess Parvati and Lord Ganesha and many other deities. The beautiful white temple is a treat for the eyes and the spiritually inclined. The premises are very clean and well maintained.The parking space is situated about 800 meters from the main temple. The road from here to the temple is flanked by a number of souvenir shops which I feel is not in tune with the atmosphere of the place. Trudging upto the temple especially in a hot day is not really a pleasant experience. This area could have been used for a parking space. Commercial considerations have been given precedence over comfort of visitors.Photography is not allowed at the interiors of the temple."
"It is one of the best temples in Goa - better than Shantadurga temple, in terms of architecture and magnificence. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is very peaceful and tranquil - we spent some time there, to rest and soak in the divine peace. Has got decent food and drinking water facilities near the temple with very well maintained temple walls, painted very recently. Has got a big tower, with gothic architecture in traditional Portuguese style, which is the hallmark of Goa. Very unique in its build - never seen a temple, that so closely resembbles a church! Its orthogonal in shape and possibly one of the only temple in India, which has a tall minar / watch tower within its premises."
We stayed in the temple premises and trust me it was one of the most divine experience  . The temple has its own beauty during the different times of the day . Try out the breakfast in the temple canteen its tasty .
