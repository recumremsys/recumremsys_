"Great place to take the grandkids.  We enjoyed the great variety of animals, including heaps of koalas.  Seeing the wombat being walked on a lead was funny.  We watched the bird and sheepdog show, which were entertaining.  Not many kangaroos or emus were interested in feeding, hiding out in their safe zones.  The platypus chasing yabbies was fun to watch."
Had a fun experience. Lots of Koalas and Kangaroos.  Had the opportunity to hold a Koala and feed the kangaroos.  Lots of informative information about all of the animals. Very well run.
"Had an fun day at the sanctuary with the family, feeding the young kangaroos was hilarious and by our visit the park raises money to rescue as rehabilitate abused or hurt animals. Good job guys"
"Had a wonderful time at Lone pine Koala Sanctuary - we were able to meet a Koala and see the bird and Kettle dog shows, while wandering the park and feed some roo's and wallaby's! Loved it, and would recommend!"
"A really fun place for kids (and adults!) to visit. Feed the kangaroos, cuddle a koala. A perfect introduction to iconic Australian animals."
"The setting of Lone Pine is truly gorgeous, and it features many koalas which you can get quite close to. But as we were told by a member of staff, Lone Pine doesn’t actually take in any koalas from the wild for rescue / rehab - but breeds them on site. This makes the place a zoo for entertainment rather than a sanctuary for koalas. The reason, or so we were told, was to avoid infectious diseases from getting on site. It does however take in other animals, the kangaroo / wallaby area is fabulous - the animals have plenty of room to run around and get away from the crowds. Holding koalas is illegal in many states now for animal welfare reasons - but not in Queensland. Great news for Lone Pine - but it did make me quite uncomfortable seeing them being held like teddy bears for photos here, albeit for short durations and cyclical. The bird enclosures were very small, and the flying fox bats also looked very depressed in their fairly small cage. We had a much nicer experience at the Koala Hospital in Port Macquarie, here koalas have lots of space and are genuinely in a sanctuary. If you’re interested, the guidelines on what makes an appropriate sanctuary are, you can find these in numerous places online."
Its main thing is the koalas. But there is plenty to see about Australian animals. Having 2 young kids they both enjoyed the day loved it all. You can pay and feed kangaroos and emus. They have a kiosk for food. You can bring your own if needed. A fun day out.
"This is just a lovely place to visit. Lots of Koalas in trees, eating and sleeping. Opportunities to have photos taken touching or cuddling  a Koala. Hand feeding Kangaroos is another great experience. A bush turkey shared our lunch table as water dragons wandered over our feet! It was a very hot and humid day so many of the animals were enjoying a siesta. We can thoroughly recommend a visit here."
This place is simply the best.  We’ve never seen so many well cared for koalas and other animals in one place.  All animals are healthy and active.  Recommend this place for a day trip.
"A good trip out along the river for the whole family. Cuddle a Koala, more the cuddly Koala than us and of course you have to feed the Kangeroo. Don't you?Nice relaxing trip some walking is a nesseccesity."
Very nice place to visit to see Koala's and Kangaroos.  There is a long wait to have your picture taken with the Koalas so plan accordingly.  Very cool demonstration of herding dogs working sheep.  Don't miss it.
Beautiful place to see wildlife. I didn’t get a chance to hold the koalas but still got a picture. The kangaroos were so cute and so friendly. Saw a few emus as well. There are a lot of animals. A little expensive but really cool. Worth it !
My wife and I spent most of the day visiting the Koala Sanctuary. They have many opportunities to see Australian wildlife. We mingled with Kangaroos and fed them. Saw serpents native to Australia.  There was an opportunity to handle a boa but not for us. The highlight of the day for my wife was when she held a Koala.
"Visited this place with my family the children loved it so did I. There are lots of koalas to photograph or just to watch.You can pay $25 to hold a koala and you get your photo taken then collect your photo before you leave, staff are very good they will take extra pics for you on your phones which was nice this meant we could all get in together and have a family pic.They have a kangeroo padock where you can feed and stroke the kangeroo's although non really wanted the food it was a lovely experience."
Loved it here. Friendly staff and you get to cuddle a koala bear. Highly recommend for a day/ half day trip with family
"Great way to spend a few hours. Walking in the Kangaroo enclosure, feeding them by hand. Awesome experience. So many Koalas. Sadly due to Covid 19 we could not get a photo with a Koala. Many birds and other animals."
Love this place. Plenty of animals. Many which you can interact with. Pay for holding snakes & koalas. I managed the whole park in 3hrs.
"We took the grandchildren for a day out. Easy to manage a pram though it was difficult to see many of the animals from it. Great range of Australian animals to see.  Youngest loved to feed and touch the free range kangaroos. They enjoyed the bird show as well as the sheep dog.  Take your own picnic as plenty of places to eat. Cafe has limited choices but provides large seating area. Buy tickets online outside the entrance. Good value. Access by car, council bus or the river from the city centre."
"Lone Pine was fantastic, we didn't realize how close up you get to get with the animals. We loved the kangaroos, koalas and wallabies the most however the entire facility was great. The animals all seemed well cared for and happy as they aren't really in cages rather free to roam. I wish I could have a pet koala after this tour, they have got to be the sweetest animal! Thank you for this great experience in Brisbane."
This is one of the cutest places on earth. Koalas so close to see and even take a photo for a charge. Make sure you get in queue well time in advance as can be limited numbers. Also other interesting animals to see and the park itself is beautiful. Spent around 3 hours and loved it.
Koalas everywhere. This was a great day. Very relaxed place. Walking through fields with wallabies and kangaroos resting. Some feeding from your hand. Then there was the Koala picture. Our tour left before this happened so we stayed and got a cab back to Brisbane. Worth every penny
Loved seeing the koalas and kangaroos. Be aware that they charge you an additional fee to hold a koala. I also liked the area they had the kangaroos because you can walk right up to them and feed them.
"Paid for the behind-the-scenes koala experience and was a wonderful time. It was also nice to go feed the barn animals and kangaroos. We drove ourselves and there was plenty of parking. Out of the other sanctuaries/zoos I visited, I probably liked this one the best in terms of how the animals were treated/their housing situations."
"Visited with two young girls , had the best time . Loads of animals to see up close . Chance to hold a koala or snake. Feed the kangaroos. So worth a visit."
"Small but a large number of exhibits, including Dingos, crocs. Look out for the many lizards that are free to roam. The snake and hold  Koala are expensive for what you get, one photo. Having said that a nice experince seeing the various indiginous animal of Austraila"
"On our first full day in Australia, our visit here gave us a great introduction and appreciation for the animals of Australia, which are very different than those native to the US. Have been to many zoos, but had never seen a cassowary, wombat, platypus, or Tasmanian devil (among other unique animals) until visiting here. It was clean, easy to find our way around, and we were able to see it all in a few hours. Glad we went!"
Went here with my son. loved the animal interaction and the staff were very knowledgeable. Ok for a quick visit not an all dayer though.
"You wont find this is Britain! Such a magical day at Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Left to wander around at our own pace, taking in all of the wildlife and then we found the kangaroos!!! hand feeding then, hugging them and stroking their young ones. I could have spent all day here. My kids haven't stopped talking about it. Deffo a must if visiting the area"
Visited the sanctity to see some Australian wildlife and it exceeded our expectations. It’s not a huge place and can be done in 1/2 day trip.Staff are friendly and informative.Koalas and kangaroo are plentiful.
"We did the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Cruise. The cruise was the best part of this day trip. Gorgeous 70 minute cruise along the river to Fig Tree Pocket. This was great as it travels in the opposite direction of all other cruises and the free City Hopper, so you see a different aspect of Brisbane. There’s food and drink on board and an interesting commentary. Disembarking at the Koala Sanctuary there are very steep, uneven steps up to the entrance, so be aware if arriving by boat. The Sanctuary itself was super disappointing. We thought there would be kangaroos just roaming around and other animals to see and pet but it is very sad and empty looking. There were two pigs in an empty pen, four goats in a fenced off area, a pen with chickens in, and a few sheep. Once you go through the kangaroo feeding area - it appears to be just a huge empty field - as you walk to the back corner you will find the kangaroo rest area which is fenced off. While you can see and feed the kangaroos close to the fence, this is not what is promised or imagined.  Also, the koalas are kept in individual little concrete huts with a single tree to climb. We found it very disappointing. Would not recommend. If you have the time, visit Australia Zoo or if travelling to Sydney visit Taronga Zoo or even Symbio Wildlife Park."
"The Sanctuary is definitely worth the trip and it is really Cool to see so many native Australian animals in on location. The Koala experience where my wife held a Koala and received a photo for like 20 AUD was great—and as a bonus, although “extras” couldn’t hold one, the staff was letting other family members get in the pictures they were taking with our personal cameras. So in addition to the one framed paid for photo, we got about 5-10 more on our phone with both of us in picture. The “open range” with the Roos, wallabies, and emus was very cool, and having them come right up and eat from your hand is a once in a lifetime experience. Note: to buy feed for this section, go into the little shop at bottom of hill next to the Koala Experience and by a bag for 2AUD. If you use the little gym all machines you will pay more for less and have to bag it yourself.The reason for 4 of 5 is because the total price for 2 adults and the Koala Experience was ~115 AUD, but the sanctuary itself is relatively small, and if you were to just walk through it in a zoo fashion, it would be less than an hour. For the money, make sure you take your time, cuddle with a Koala, feed the Roos, and sit in on all shows and feedings!!"
Went on the mirimar cruise which includes entry into lone pine. A wonderful way to spend a few hours. Lovely seeing the koalas and kangaroos in an environment that was ideal. Every so often you come across a lizard who are quite happy to pose for pics. Staff work really hard. Cannot fault the place so well worth a visit
Absolutely loved this place ! A real memory maker.  Buy the Roo food for $2-00 & spend ages cuddling & feeding them food. Used the boat transfer from Brisbane.  Really lovely.  Highly recommend.
"I loved how the staff were so passionate about Koala Preservation & their dedication to protecting the Koala Species. I went to one of the talks in the research building to hear all about Koalas and it was great to speak to one of the experts afterwards. The Sanctuary feels very much like a zoo the way it’s layes out - it’s quite easy to navigate & is suitable for families with small children. You can even hold a Koala & stroke one too, as well as experience other animals too such as snakes & feed Kangaroos etc. It’s quite a small place & parking is slightly scarce depending on what time you arrive. The car parks huge but it was packed when we got there so perhaps go when it first opens to avoid any parking issues. It was also surprisingly busy too & full or tourists more than we would have liked - as we were hoping it would be slightly less commercial. However it’s not a bad thing considering all the admission money all goes back into supporting the Sanctuary’s work & protecting Koalas. It’s a great little day out for a morning or afternoon visit. We stopped here as we drove through Brisbane on our road trip to break the journey up & it was a great way to stretch our legs too & grab a much needed coffee & of course see some beautiful Koalas. Also - tip, if you’re desperate for a coffee / snack or cold drink at lunchtime - avoid going to the main cafe as it will be heaving & overcrowded. Go to the one situated in the car park just outside the main entrance in a little wooden shack & you’ll get what you need quicker. I hope whoever reads this found this helpful,  Enjoy - the Koalas are adorable."
"We enjoyed the vibe of the sanctuary and how it focuses on the koalas health and safety rather than the visitors, which is why it is quite small. The grounds are lovely for family picnics and bbq's but if you are expecting a lot of interactivity, this isn't the place for you. However, it is a lovely place for a wander and to see some koalas. Watch out for the spiders though!"
