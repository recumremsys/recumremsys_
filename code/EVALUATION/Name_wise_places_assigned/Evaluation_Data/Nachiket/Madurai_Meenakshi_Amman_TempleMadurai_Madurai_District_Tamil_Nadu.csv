Went with the family for Darshan of goddess meenakshi and lord shiva. The architecture is imposing and the temple had some seriously amazing paintings and artwork. However good things end there.The temple is under the control of greedy priests. They will charge for everything from darshan to aarti. Better to go early morning as evening sees huge rush and the wait time for Darshan can be close to 4 hours. No amenities for young kids. You can't even feed little kids.
"A Beautiful Temple with Splendid Architecture and History.. The Place is known for Tamil Literature. Madurai Meenakshi , Kasi Visalakshi and Kanchi Kamatch i are revered Godesses in Hindu Tradition. The Temple is always crowded and it is advisable to get special Entry Tickets.But the Darshan is well organised. Take your time to visit all the Sannadhis and aslo enjoy the magnificent sculptures. It is advised to visit in the mornings."
"This Meenakshi Sundareshwara Temple Complex is a massive affair. Getting in is a real effort probably easier getting into Fort Knox! No shoes, no large bags, no knees on show, no coloured sarongs, no watches, calculators, cancers, phones, videos - in fact nothing electrical! You…"
"Meenakshi Amman temple needs no introduction. It is one of the greatest temples in our country. We visited there recently and had a very good darshan of the Goddess and the Lord.The temple opens at 5:00 AM. While it is advised to reach there as early as possible after it opens, there always is a long winding queue. Especially during festivals and on Fridays (Friday is considered auspicious for the goddess). We landed up on a Friday, a day after the temple had been closed due to a solar eclipse. One can imagine the crowd. Here I must compliment the temple management for the logistics and crowd management. Overall the temple was quite clean and well organised. No wonder it has won many accolades.Note: There are two types of darshan, free and paid. The paid darshan costs 50 ₹ for Goddess alone and 100 ₹ for both Meenakshi and Sundareswarar. Though the paid darshan is called ""Fast"" it is likely to take 2-3 hours, so be prepared. The other places include pottramarai tank and 1000 pillar Mandapam. Note cellphones and other recording devices are not allowed. There are shops that open early and allow pilgrims to leave their in their premises. Of course they also try to sell their products on collection of footwear. These shops are mostly government run shops like khadi and are not aggressive or pushy if one says no.As with any temple beware of touts."
One of my favorite place in madurai. Feel like heaven when we are inside the temple. The pool itself give u peaceful meditation.
"Surrounded by a huge commercial /thickly populated area this temple stood as the centre of the ancient city Madurai.Approx 2 hrs may take to cover all areas inside the boundary wall.No mobile phones,chappals,powerbank,camera,half pants are allowed inside the premises. Security…"
"Visited this temple after 3 years, Approach road allround the temple is being relaid and renovated.Looks better, more space for walking. It is a huge temple with 4 entrances with Rajagopuram. Nice architecture and place is kept neat and clean.Had  special darshan within one hour waiting."
We always amazed the way temple was built which is centuries old. Great architecture and history behind. Famous for Lord Shiva and Meenakshi Amman. Spend atleast half a day to look around the temple and interiors of temple. Usually crowded specially with local worshippers visit in huge numbers. Just divine and peace inside. Lots of shops outside surrounding the temple. Must to do while in Madurai.
"Wanted to visit this temple for the last 10 years and could finally only make it now. Darshan is available for all but money makes access to the deity closer and faster. Hire a guide thus temple has history.We went around 7:30 am the crowd was normal. The temples, pillar and carvings are beautiful.  I would even call them spectacular.  Notice the carvings of the God and goddesses, the details of muscles, fingers and jewelry. Be sure to visit the 1000 pillar museum. The temple has several accesses. We went through the east door and left our footwear in the car."
"It was really an awesome experience to have a trip to madurai meenakshi and rameswaram temple. Was a pilgrimage, but it was really amazing because of the historical places and those temples architectural sculptures. We cannot even think about the marvelous sculptures in big rocks.Rameswaram was famous for its beautiful sea and it's beaches. Religiously very famous. Rama sethu is an another miracle which was made centuries ago. A lot of religiously and historically famous places in rameswaram and in madurai.Old markets will warmly welcome you."
"The plan to visit Meenakshi temple was perfectly executed through a busy weekend trip to Madurai. It was a Sunday, so we had to be early in the morning to be near to the temple premises. You have to deposit mobile phones, shoes and all baggages in the temple cloak room before proceeding to enter the temple. Upon entering through the gate, one will be spellbound seeing the finest architecture of ancient India. There are 2 possibilities for getting a glimpse of Goddess Meenakshi, 1. Free Entry 2. Paid ticket of Rs. 100. The overall atmosphere inside the temple arena becomes heavenly, pacified by the peacefulness and charming rays emanating from the various deities and the recitation of ancient verses. There are lots to know about the background behind each god/Goddess being worshipped inside the various corners of the temple. For us, it took 4-5 hours for getting into such details to experience the beauty of temple design. Food in the form of prasadam is also available inside the temple. But no toilets...Afternoon, you can visit nearby areas to shop, as you wish. A lot of trains connect Madurai to Chennai in the evening and night which travellers can plan accordingly. Overall, a mesmerising place to be in, The Meenakshi Temple,Madurai...."
Stay away from local temple people as they keep asking for money by many means. Also temple priests are greedy for money (at least ones we faced to). Asking to donate compulsory in their hands for cracking coconut for which we had already paid the fees officially.
Visited the temple with family. Had a 5 year old and a 1.5 yr old along. The temple looks amazing from outside. I did not enter the temple because of the Idiotic security. They do not allow and mobile or electronic accessory inside which makes sense as they don't want people to…
"visited this temple few times, latest visit on 6th December that too on a Friday morning, during the return trip from sabharimala yatra. First thing you should note is Mobiles are not allowed inside and hence it it better if you keep it your hotel rooms. Next one is that if you really want to see the temple architecture, you must at least spend two hours apart from the waiting time for darshan of Meenakshi and Chokkanathar. Presiding diety is Meenakshi, as the name of the temple goes.While entering please note the direction of the entrance otherwise if you exit through another gate finding the way to your place of stay will be difficult. Darshan waiting time depends on the particular day rush and you may decide either to buy special darshan tickets or go by free darshan. You must not miss seeing 1000 pillar mandapam, where they have exhibited statues of various historical periods and also somewhat about the history of the temple. If you are having infants, temple authorities will serve hot milk for infants, as a very special and unique service to children. the trouble of touts/agents is minimal in this temple but if you want you can use the service of a guide for Rs.100/- upwards. After darshan take rest by doing at least meditation of 10 minutes in the temple, you will find real inner peace."
"Very nice around sunset as the light is beautiful! Don't miss the museum in the 1000 pillars room... magnificent... even if all the added parts (vitrines, lightning...) are ruining the beauty of this place.  The sculptures are sumptuous. "
"Of all the temples I have visited in India, this temple comes out as the most troublesome to visit. They have ridiculously strict policies on what you can bring and can't. Bring the smallest bag you can, forget even tote bags. They do not allow bigger bags, mobile phones or any…"
"This is a gargantuan complex - more like a fort than a temple with 4 huge entrances that encapsulate acres of temple area inside. The structure along with its wall carvings, statues etc. is well restored. The main sanctum ( as it is with most popular hindu temples ) houses a…"
"Heading South from Chennai we were glad this was the final temple destination otherwise the others might not have impressed! It really was the ultimate, with everything bigger, brighter, more spectacular. Allow plenty of time and if you don't have a guide be prepared to go round…"
Excellent architecture. Beware of lot of taut's that are trying to sell fake artefacts outside the temple. Please get a guide to explain you the temple. Foreign tourists and non hindus are not allowed within the temple. Getting a speed up line by paying Rs 100/50 is better. Note that both Rs 100 and Rs 50 fast line are the same.
"While this temple attracts a lot of tourists, I recommend going very early--6 am. or so--both because it's cooler and because you are there with ""devotees"" (worshippers) more than with tourists, so the ambiance is different.  Be aware of the strict access controls:  no bags, no…"
it is great place to visit ...at least once in life time we should go there to experience richness of ancient  architecture. check the time of temple closure or else u have to wait for more than 40 min.
"A large temple that dates back several centuries and according to some a few thousand years old. Get there in the morning as the crowds are less, keep congnisant of the hours when it is open. A strict security check does not allow visitors to carry anything in, including wallets…"
"Maginificent , spiritual and mesmerizing. Visit the place and take a bow to the great architectures. Viist the place for experiencing the peace within. Morning and evenings are best time to visit as afternoons temp are high in the place."
"Nice architecture. Beware of lot of taut's that are trying to sell fake artifacts outside the temple. Foreign tourists and non Hindus are not allowed within the temple. Mobiles, Electronic Gadgets and bags are not allowed inside the temple for that they have proper counter to submit and get the token to collect it back.Getting a speed up line by paying Rs 100/50 is better. Note that both Rs 100 and Rs 50 fast line are the same but 100 Rs for 2 temple entry and 50 for just 1."
Enjoyed the visit to this amazing place. A good Gide really helps to understand the site and its meaning. We found one inside who spoke good English and was very knowledgeable - and it really added to the experience.
"Hit the road at 6am ,back by 8:20am. No people and little traffic. A wonderful temple complex. Walking around it the previous evening we could not see the size of it. But that morning, mo electronics, phone camera etc are accepted, so no pictures, unfortunately. The complex is…"
You have to check in your shoes and mobile and cameras outside as it is not permitted to take them inside. Have to ware long pants and shirt. Female is required to cover themselves as no sleeve less tops. Once paid for VIP line the Brahmins insist on doing pooja and request more…
"We spent over 2 and a half hours. It is a complex that deserves that kids of time. It is truly a bhavya temple. Don't miss the thousand pillars monument as well. If you come to Tamil Nadu, do not miss this. Can enter on any of the 4 sides, depending on the day and where you are. "
Visited on Sunday around 530pm and did not feel it to be crowded (though do not have a reference point of other days). The temple has 5 entrances and we used the north entrance. No electronics (including smartwatches) are allowed in the temple premises and the process of…
"Had a very very satisfying experience. One must take a guide to really appreciate and understand finer details of the carvings on deities on pillars, special Darshan and blessings of the lord🙏"
