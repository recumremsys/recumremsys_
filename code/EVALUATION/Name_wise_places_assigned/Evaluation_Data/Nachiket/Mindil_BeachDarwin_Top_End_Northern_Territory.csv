We deliberately extended our stay to attend these markets and so glad we did. Crowds are massive it’s like an event on the Darwin social calendar. Heaps of food vans and so many stalls. Don’t overthink it just make your plans and head to these markets and enjoy the experience. Graham and Diana - Blaxland Blue Mountsins
"The market is great for food lovers, not so much for those looking for souvenirs. Had we researched prior to our visit, it is likely that we would have skipped this venue."
"How good are these markets? Visiting from Sydney it was amazing to see how many market and high quality food stalls there were! No price gouging, free water fill by the beach, and then that sunset! Must do!"
"Enjoyed the sunset on my first visit to the markets, highly recommended the Thursday night markets! Close to the city but then again everything seems close in darwin"
Our hotel had a complimentary shuttle to the markets as it gets crowded with cars. There were so many food trucks and so much food to chose from. Some very nice jewellry and a stall of bag tags made from old dictoraries which were great. Got my nephew some camel jerky. The sunset from there was lovely and a nice way to cool down after a hot day.
Swimming is a big no no due to the crocodile risk. But Thursday night markets are a must. Very popular and somewhat crowded. Take a chair or picnic rug so you can relax with dinner and then go down to the beach to watch the sunset. The variety of food is astounding. Many stalls with a large variety of merchandise. Michiko's nature paintings are amazing ...she also paints on site.. Also a good place to watch Aboriginal artists at work and buy very reasonably priced paintings in different sizes.
Be there for sunset. Good variety of interesting stalls and food choices. Great atmosphere. A must do if visiting Darwin in dry season.
"Enjoyed a really great Thursday Mindil markets. A great buzz, lots of food including multiple coeliac friendly gluten free dishes. Magic subset over the ocean."
"Mindel Beach markets are worth visiting not just for the vast array of foods to sample and local products but the sunset is magnicent. The pictures I took on my mobile phone are awesome. I will be framing some for sure. Relaxing, friendly atmosphere."
"The mindil beach markets are awesome! Worst thing about it is making a choice of which delicious foods to eat then rolling back to your car you're so full !! Take plenty of cash as the crafts , clothes and jewellery are beautiful and some stalls give a discount for cash."
"The markets are a popular tourist attraction. In all honesty I think things are a little overpriced. Food wasn’t fantastic and all averaging between $10-$20. (Also it’s on the beach. Have a look at the dust and sand on the displays, surely that ends up in the food.)The locals rave about the sunset there, but I come from Perth, I see that same, even better, sunset from there. If you live on the east coast and don’t get to see the sun setting over the ocean. Then it’s worth the hustle. Gets very crowded after 6pm and very long waits on food. Catch an uber or taxi from the city and get them to drop you off and pick you up in one of the adjacent streets. Just walk across. Cause it’s a long traffic jam to get out, and will cost you extra $. Sky city casino is just next door, so you can go for a few drinks or a gamble if that’s your thing. (Sandbar) is a great place to have a few at the casino. With a live band or singer, dance floor and a great outdoor smoking terrace."
"Went here on recommendations from friends and from TripAdvisor.  The actual market was average (more food than goods to purchase - bit of a disappointment after the market at Port Douglas - just wanted to buy some trinkets and it really had nothing much).  HOWEVER, the sunset on the beach was just wonderful and had many people waiting to watch it.  The crowd (and there were many there) clapped when the sun actually set - so that was something different.  Would go again just for the sunset."
Went to Mindel beach market on my recent holiday to Darwin. It is a very large market and has plenty of food options the sunset is worth a look on the beach can get very crowded. Thursday night is the quieter of the nights to have a look.
went to Mindil beach the day of the beer can regatta. Was a bit disappointed as the build up was more than the experience. Markets are like any other markets and lots of food stalls
If your into food from all over the world and street entertainment this is the place to be on a nice warm night.  Pick your favourite food and then settle down on the beach and watch the sunset!
Stunning sunsets and the markets are awesome! Went back more than once during stay - so much mixture of cultures and tasty cuisines on offer
"Arrived in time for sunset, which was a great social event. Market not so much.. very crowded and we didn't see anything we wanted. Had a good paella tho, which we ate on the beach."
"Heard about it but had no idea how popular it is among tourists and locals alike.A huge variety of quality food trucks, rather than try and list them all, let's say 15 international cuisine varieties and multiples of several.Lots of market stalls to buy souvenirs and trinkets as well as clairvoyant, massages, buskers etc.Then the sunset - and this happens daily!!  There are probably certain weather conditions that make one more spectacular than another, but even a normal one is impressive, add in the market, food trucks and buskers and it becomes the must see Darwin experience.The market is seasonal, the sunset daily."
Had a wander around the markets at Mindil Beach. Lots of different food choices and things to see. Very busy
"Enjoy a meal from the Mindil Markets while watching the sun set over the water. This is always a novelty for an East Coaster. Mindil Beach does not have the best surf or the whitest of sand and can get quite busy during peak and market times, but it is a beautiful place to sit and relax if you time it just right."
"It was far too crowded for me to enjoy,  like most Darwin outdoor events there were dozens of food stalls, hope you don't mind sitting in amongst the enormous crowd too eat. Get there very early,  eat and then go to one of hundreds of other empty places to watch the sundown. You might get a clear view here from wast deep water."
"Brought the family for the Sunday markets hoping to get some good local buys. Markets were a mix of local items plus your usual stuff you can get anywhere. You are spoilt for choice with food offerings and it was hard to pick what to eat, food vendors also require cash. Sunset one the beach was great but packed. Clean toilets. Get there early for easy parking. Parking is free"
"Plenty of food at the markets and the sunset is spectacular.We were told there is crocs in the water so be careful. It maybe a myth, but swim at own risk lol. Pull up a spot on the sand and watch the sun set."
"Visiting the Mindil Beach Night Markets, buying dinner and eating it on the beach watching the sunset is an unforgettable event. The casual calm atmosphere as everyone is doing the same activity as you makes for a special event."
"We were only overnight in Darwin and were recommended to go to the Mindil Beach Night Markets - lucky for us it was a Thursday! We got ourselves some food from one of the many food stalls and wandered off to the beach.  Amazing beach, and what a sight with so many people there - we were blown away - especially when the sun went down. What a good market it was too, many and varied! Watched a diggery doo player, saw a stocky cracking his crocodile whip and listened to a magic man trying to sell his wares - it was all there!  This is definitely a must do while in Darwin."
"Lots of fun, great food, great vibe, amazing sunset!!  The two guys doing the fog and drumming set were amazing. We are vegan and had one of the best laksa! Watching the sun go down on the beach is spectacular!!"
Attend often during the dry season. Very laidback atmosphere with lots of variety of food outlets and stalls.
We walked to the market from town and arrived before sunset. So many people on the beach enjoying the sunset it was a great experience. Loved every minute of my time here and will definitely be back.
"Was lots of fun, a bit toutisty lots of great food stalls and some local crafts. Fantastic atmosphere."
"Decent for a quick dinner after viewing the sunset which was pretty nice. Markets were nothing to shout about, typical Australian markets fanfare, though variety was great. Got 1/2 a dozen oysters amongst other asian food. Half of those oysters were not fresh sadly."
"This is a seasonal place and we managed to visit on the last week before the annual closure. It’s located on the beach foreshore, lots of parking and easy access from the CBD. Whatever your food desires you are sure to find it here. Stroll along and check the stalls out before making your choice. Reasonable priced this is the place for an early evening feed. Recommended Sri Lanka curry and Laksa. Enjoy"
A must do for Darwin. Great value and food brilliant. Go and try. Transport easy by public bus or hotel shuttle.
A fantastic array of inexpensive food options in a relaxed setting by the beachGet a cheap feed and sit and watch theSunset. You might wish to bring a rug orTowel to sit on as seating is at a real premium. Tried some fab Sri Lankan curries washed down with a fresh mangoLassi. A Darwin dry season must.
Visited here to see sunset and wasn’t disappointed. A beautiful stretch of beach facing west so really benefits from its position if you’re searching for a great sunset. Grab a drink from the Sand Bar in the casino and then wander down to the beach through the resort gardens. Memorable experience
"Soft powdery sand, clean beach and a great spot for sunset. Head there on market day to get some fantastic food from all over the world!"
