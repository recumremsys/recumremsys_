The island is stunning if you enjoy walking and scenery and wildlife. As heaps of wombats and wallabies . Loved it
"Wombats everywhere!! For a nature lover of wildlife especially, like me paradise. Saw Kangaroos moving from the bush down to the open ground mid afternoon. Walked in the ocean in the Bay round to painted rocks. Glorious!  Probably the highlight of my Tasmanian trip."
"Come to Maria Is. for easy walks, some views and lots of wildlife. When we visited lots of wombat mums and bubs - these are very cute. Not unusual to see 7 wombats at a time grazing near the main campsite and similar numbers of wallaby and paddymelon (small wallaby). Occasional Tasmanian Devil on dusk waling through the camp area. If you are camping you must suspend your food in a bag from a tree or better still, get a metal food container from the ranger station, otherwise the possums will destroy your food. Frenchs farm was more relaxing camping than the main camp as many fewer people and more open and natural. Fossil cliffs and Bishop adn Clerk walks worth doing. If  you dont want to walk far just go and see the fossil cliffs - millions of fossils. Rangers are helpful whewn questioned but seem a bit preoccupied and not as organised as other parks. For instance no weather forecasts posted at the Ranger station. Maria Is. is popular with locals because its so easy to get to, and international travellers because wildlife is so plentiful. In one afternoon and evening you will see more wombats, wallabies, possums and maybe a tasmanian devil. Main campsite has hot showers ( $1) and undercover cooking facilities you need to bring your own pots/utensils. The tracks suffered last week in the floods but are still easy walking. If you like push bike trail biking most tracks on Maria Is are wide and suitable for bikes."
"Well-preserved, beautiful island with fantastic nature! I saw cape barren geese, wombats and wallabies everywhere. Too bad I was there for 24-hour overnight stay, but the weather was perfectly bright. My friend Anabel and I walked to the painted cliff to watch sunset and woke up early the next morning to hike up to Mt. Bishop & Clerk! We passed the fossil cliff on our way there and finished the walk within 4 hours. Coming back to our camp at noon sweating like pigs, we jumped into the water, had a nice cold shower and enjoyed our easy lunch. It's a wonderful experience for a camping beginner like me!"
"What an interesting location; history, geography, scenery and beaches. The walking trails are well maintained, marked and supported with interpretative signs. If you only have a day make the most of it and see what you can, but you really need a couple of days to fully appreciate and explore this island. Camping grounds and bunk house available for overnight stays but no shops or commercial outlets other than bike hire on the island. Yes a great location for mountain bike riding."
"Have heard of Maria Island but nothing about what is over there including the fauna, the historical buildings (some from the convict times), the cliffs and the various walks.First was checking in at the Information centre where the 2 ladies were very friendly and helpful - brochures & tips.Then the 30 minuted boat trip over - the vessel is impressive and was a calm ride both ways, and the skipper gave an informative commentary. The boat had a small cafe serving hot & cold drinks incl alcohol. The boat goes regularly throughout the day,Once there, the suprises keep coming.  We walked to the Painted Cliffs (north west) which was an easy 30 minute walk and at lowish tide allowed for a walk along the beach and than around the low cliffs which were amazingly weathered in shape and showed a rainbow of colours. Was a fantastic photo opportunity.From there we walked back past the Oast House (semi-ruined) and onto the Fossil Cliffs (northern side of the island) - this walk was a bit longer & a bit more challenging. Once at the fossil cliffs you can walk down to the rock face and look at some of the fossils whilst also looking north over Bird Island & onto the Freycinet peninsula. The sheerness of the drop off the cliff was pretty spectacular.Then back to the 'town' to see the various old buildings which are brilliantly maintained - some are from the convict period, and some from the industrial occupations since. Have to say a great display.  Near the dock is also the old Commissariat store which houses a wonderful static display as well as some great videos on the release of Tassie Devils on the island. There is also a Rangers Office who can help with advice & maps.  Various other convict buildings or later around the island - the barn is in fantastic condition.The wildlife is also great - wombats a plenty (we even got to see a joey out having a feed with his mum) and so many roos & wallabies. The Cape Barren geese were also a treat - first time I had seen them.  I understand there are also Tassie devils but unfortunately didn't see them - not suprising as not there at night.There is also accommodation for hire, a camping ground and bikes for hire - the island is large & if you wish to explore the southern area a bike is a must. There is no food or drink for sale so you need to be self sufficient & bring your rubbish back home.We went on the 9am ferry & back on the 3.30 & that was just enough time for what we did. Do yourself a favour & get there."
"If you like walks, wildlife, historic sites and / or nature in general, Maria Island is of course a place you should visit. Tasmania itself is a beautiful, impressive island, and Maria Island seems to be a smaller version of it, where Mother Nature squeezed all her wonders in a smaller, more compact version. Walks of many diffrent grades with impressive coastal views and beaches (and / or mountains), bike rental (or bring your own), swimming, wildlife watching, there are so many options you can chose from, that a one day trip (which is actually only a few hours) will only scratch the surface of what MI has to offer. The only recommendation i could give: stay overnight and take your time! Walk around the airfield-meadows during sunset and enjoy the real beauty of the Island with less tourists and more wildlife, after the last ferry has left. Sitting there among Roos and Wombats and watching the sunset in silence is truly a priceless experience. And especially after dark you may hear some strange growlings across the island...for staying overnight I personally would prefer the campground over the convict-building, just because of the wild, nocturnal visitors that my be around then and being closer to nature, anyway...but stow away your foods and rubbish in the bins provided, there are many curious Possums and Pademelons around at the campsite. Or other creatures. The facilities there make it easier to stay a night or two. Or even more. You could also camp in a more remote area at French Farm, to have even more privacy. Luckily, there are no shops (yet) on MI, so bring your own supplies with you and be aware, that you have to take all your rubbish back with you as there is no disposal facility on the island. And do not expect to find a stable phone coverage or even data-able connection there.Overall, MI is truly amazing and i give a full recommendation for all nature lovers.The only thing i would wish is, that the Tassie Government would strictly limit / reduce the amount of daily / and overnight visitors. Also the behaviour of some ""special"" visitors should be monitored much stricter and also be fined easier (chasing animals with selfie sticks etc.). You can get nice pictures by approaching quietly and gently to the wildlife, without scaring or cornering them.  If you behave correctly, they will most probably let you come close enough to get some good shots - and won´t be bothered. So bring a tele-lense camera instead of a smartphone. There is absolutely no need to do ""Wombat-Selfies"" or running after their Joeys!  But i guess, MI has sadly become an too important business to really enforce some stricter regulations. I just hope they won´t open hotels and restaurants on this island one day in the future and that it will keep its natural charme, despite the huge number of people going there. So: Go there! You better should! But if you do, please always show the respect that this island and its furry locals deserve and you will be happy when leaving, looking forward to visiting again."
"Took the Maria Island Ferry for a day trip to Maria Island. The whole island is a national park. The wildlife is everywhere. Kangaroos, Wombats. Wild Geese.The main attractions are the convict era buildings and the natural features. Fossil Cliffs. Painted Cliffs. Reservoir Circuit. The island requires a lot of walking and there are NO shops on site, so bring everything with you. You MUST book to travel over to the island."
"This island is truly magical ! You have to get there by ferry as cars are not allowed. Only Wildlife Tasmania have vehicles on the island. You can walk or cycle around the island itself and marvel in the wildlife (wombats, geese), the rocks and the beach. Try and visit on a clear, warm day and enjoy the tranquility and fresh air. Wombats come out in the afternoon, the local chooks and geese are out all day. You can stay at the backpackers which used to be accomodation places for convicts back in the old day."
"This is a beautiful place. Wombats are so plentiful in the late afternoon that they resemble flocks of grazing sheep.With the help of their cousins - the kangaroos, they keep the vegetation well shorn. In fact in parts the island looks overgrazed.Cape Barren geese stalk around Darlington with an impressive patch of greenish / yellow 'high-viz' skin just above their bills.We didn't see any Devils but their scats are plentiful.This is a place for people of all ages. Walks abound and vary in difficulty from the  easy walks around the historic township, to destinations such as the Painted Cliffs and Fossil Bay and the challenging climb to Bishop & Clerk with its fabulous views.Ferries run regularly from the mainland though we visited aboard the Lady Eugenie with the Tasmanian Walking Company.No shops - so take everything you will need, including your bicycle if you like riding. The trails are good and bikes are popular way around most sites. There are toilet facilities at the Darlington peer."
Painted Cliffs is a highlight of my Tasmania trip!  There are so beautiful!  I also saw several wombats!1. Do check the tide information when planning your trip to Maria Island if you wish to see the Painted Cliffs.  The cliffs are only exposed within two hours of the low tides.2. You can cycle to very near the cliffs where there is parking for the bicycles.3. It might be best to book the ferry tickets on-line in advance as it gets filled up during summer.
"Best ever walking tour...climb Bishop and Clerk...see all sorts of wildlife ( including the Tassie Devil in the wild at night!) Learn the history of this incredible island ...geology , wildlife and the families of those who lived there. Fantastic support from guides Jef and Declan. Would not hesitate to recommend."
"Maria Island is a very interesting place to visit. Being so isolated, you need to bring your own water and food (especially important if you are camping). There are beautiful walks and a sense of quiet you don't get very often in life. However, while the convict history is very clear, with buildings and guide points, I couldn't find very much about Aboriginal populations. I would like to see a full island overlay of sacred sites and information about massacres and other displacement. If we are to overcome current racism, we need to acknowledge what happened in the past and what flows over to today."
"Maria Island is close enough to to Hobart for a day trip or better still book in with Maria Island Walks and experience the full splendour and diversity of this historic island staying in their purpose built and very comfortable huts. Explore Darlington with its rich history of convicts and the ventures of the eccentric Italian entrepreneur Diago Bernacchi. If you sign up with Maria Island Walks you will get to stay in Bernacci's fully restored house in Darlington. The wild life, rugged scenery and secluded beaches will not disappoint."
"This is a wonderful place to visit and so beautiful. Lovely bea he's, great trails and lots of interesting history. It was great renting a bike so you can get further in a day trip. Recommended."
"Ferry was a good choice & discount for NP Pass & Pension.  Island is stunning with great views, walking trails & lots of wombats.  We are in our 60's & hired mountain bikes on the island & these were well maintained & great to tackle the many hills - we enjoyed the challenge & fun going down hill.  Take your own picnic lunch & water, hat & sunscreen.  No shops."
"Sensational guided walk.  3 nights/4 days of nature, great company and wonderful meals.   Small groups of 8-10 ... Experienced, informative and fun guides.  I'd recommend this walk with this company to anyone from easy walkers to those who enjoy a challenge.  Thanks to all at Maria Island Walks."
"A beautiful place to learn about history.  Book the ferry at the Triabunna info center.  The staff are very helpful with suggestions about when and where to go.  It's a short and scenic ferry trip.  Once there, you can take various self-guided walks around the island. You can make it as strenuous or as leisurely as you like.  It's easy to spot wildlife.  From the pier, I took off to the left and was soon strolling through groups of kangaroos who took little notice of me.  There are also pandemelons, at least one wombat, Cape Barren geese, native hens, white faced heron and black currawong.  I was able to cover most of the walks in the vicinity of Darlington.  Check the tides and be sure to visit the Painted Cliffs and the exhibits in Darlington.  It's a full day and well worth the trip."
"A 4 day walk ( one of the Great Walks of Australia - for good reason) on Maria Island by The Maria Island Walk Co, highlights magnificent scenery, abundant wildlife, historic Darlington town  and scenic coatsline. Wonderful meals prepared by tour leaders, and wine, featuring Tasmanian produce. The last night is in Bernacchi House, a fully restored 18th century home with log fires and all the comforts of home. Tour leaders went out of their way to make this a very memorable journey, walking was easy-paced, there was nothing they couldn't do for you. Ensure you book with ""The Maria Island Walk ""."
"Peaceful place, great camping with toilets, BBQs and showers. Great for kids with heaps of space to ride bikes. You have to take everything on the ferry with you but there is a lot of space. Walk to Bishop and Clerk for fantastic views.Keep an eye on the wombats!"
"Explore the Majestic island on the East Coast of Tasmania. Take a ferry form Triabuanna, which take 30 mins to the Island. Book an accomodation on the island with the Tasmania National parks services or take all your camping gears to stay there for a night. The island have spectacular views of the ocean. Explore the fossil cliffs and Painted cliffs which are amazing. If you are very fit go to Bishop and Creek or Mt Maria for Hiking. Explore the waters near by snorkelling."
Visited this wonderful national park on 5 Dec 2016 & spent the day wandering around this beautiful island with differing vegetation lots of animals & birds. Plan your day to visit Painted cliffs at low tide to get the most from it.. Also I think you need to love walking although if not climbing Bishop & Clerk or Mt Maria it is fairly easy. We did not hire bikes & most riders we met wished they hadn't. The facilities are very clean.I will certainly go back when next in Tassie. Take note you must take your own food & most importantly water.. it is a national park so no shops..
Great place with plenty of natural beauty. Definitely worth a day (or more if camping). Lots of beautiful views although we liked the painted rocks the best. Make sure you look at the tide tones and get there as close to low tide as possible (this will be dictated by when the boat gets there though.) We just made it in time to get to the more impressive parts around the corner
"Such a beautiful place for a few days of relaxation. We had 2 nights, 3 days to explore this pretty place. Hiking, bike riding and swimming at remote beaches. Stayed in the penitentary. Only regret is that we took too much stuff!! We took too much water, thinking there was none available, but there was plenty of tank water for cooking needs. Probably best to check before you go. We also took cooking gear, but the mess hall has gas cooking facilities and hot water on tap for washing up. Without the excess gear it would have been easier to transport everything to the accommodation, although there are trolleys at the pier. Plenty of wildlife, sunsets, ruins and views to photograph. Will definitely return!"
"We went over to Maria Island for the day hoping mostly to see wildlife during some of the walks. It was a very warm sunny day that was lovely for hiking, but the wildlife was in hiding. We did not see a single sighting of any wildlife on the day we spent there other than the beautiful Cape Barron Geese.  So that was disappointing, but wildlife doesn't live there to please us! We were told by the ranger that cooler or overcast days, or early morning, early evening times are good times but those times don't coincide with the ferry times. Staying overnight would likely guarantee lots of wildlife viewing.  But we did enjoy doing a few of the walks around the coastal areas and to the painted rocks and the scenery was certainly peaceful, blissfully undeveloped, and very pretty."
"We had a magic day on Maria, following the Fossil Cliffs trail. To a couple of old fossils the 3 hour walk seemed about right for us and it was. We explored the old buildings, and read the stories of the convict days, found some old machinery from the cement factory days and, yes, wandered along the fossil cliffs looking at fossils. The scenery is great, the numerous species of animals and birds fascinating, and the signwriting helpful while not being overpowering. Plenty of information is available from the rangers and anywhere is a good place for a picnic lunch. Being a smallish island it is cooler so an extra inner layer and a windproof outer layer is a good idea. We loved it and would happily return next opportunity."
Finally made it to Maria Island.The weather was just perfect so much to see . Walking was not difficult wonderful views and came across plenty of wild life . A must if you are visiting Tasmania . Don’t forget to bring your camera water and your lunch . Enjoy
"An entire National Park 'girt by sea' ... ferry leaves from Triabunna, takes 30minutes, runs all weather and no-one is left on the island.  Quiet beaches to camp by, 1000m mountain called 'Bishop and Clerk' on which to scrabble for exquisite marine views, vestiges of convict buildings, and soon to have Tasmanian devils introduced, to cull all those darn wombats, wallabies, kangaroos, pademelons, native hens and Cape Barron geese!  Get there this year to walk wild in a natural zoo!"
Enjoy the ferry ride and complete as many of the iconic walks as you can. Fantastic place to visit. Plenty of wildlife to see and historic buildings to explore.
"Wow! Patriotic Aussies must visit !  Our history - ( Penal settlement set up  5 years BEFORE Port Arthur)  A world heritage listed probation station no less but so unknown & so well preserved !Buildings that housed convicts used as accommodation, Coffee Palace to wander thru, colonial buildings,the 2 roomed ''house'' where O'Brien an Irish political prisoner was housed,his poetry, the old pottery  works building you stumble across as you walk to Fossil Cliffs. etc etc .Stunning scenery of cliffs ,fossilized shells quarried once to supply cement made on the island. Several families lived here, farming etc until the last person buried in the cemetry in 1941.Triabunna on the mainland is where u catch the ferry. We ( parents & 2 daughters in 20s) stayed at Triabunna Caravan Park which  supplied books in our cabin to fill in the historical gaps . Great resource . Thankyou ! The cabin was small but for 2 nights (pre & post  ferry trip ) was fine. A double bed up one end & 4 bunks at other , was extremely clean & had all a motel room would have . We went free on the ferry on Thursday of Queens Birthday weekend 2013(last weekend) . People missed bookings for Sat as all booked out . June trips were free. They had to pay to go on another charted boat . National Parks subsidized the free trips .  It meant Winter work for National Parks Rangers too. Weather was fine , cool until 3:30pm when wind turned colder & stronger. It was hard walking , coming back to jetty from along airsrtip. We walked but you can cycle around the island to different places. Many did. We only did the walk to the Fossil Cliffs in our day trip but we had a slower member. Grey haired people cycled or walked or just stayed  around the main area, young people with their small children cycled or were going to camp. You can camp  ( no booking required  & camping fees only for Darlington campground) or day trip too. Otherwise a mattress is supplied in the Convict Quarters called The Penitentiary .Also a Coonara type wood heater  & 6 bunks in each. There is the Convict's Mess Hall too where there is free coffee/tea & tables etc.Showers($1) & toilets  & a laundry are nearby  the Convict's Quarters.Bird poo all  in the grass as the Cape Barren Geese never seem to leave the place.So no barefoot walking off the verandah .Hah! Some people spotted 5 wombats . We saw one close to the jetty just before the 4pm ferry arrived  & a big mob of kangaroos near airfield.The staff are all so Friendly.(Maybe because they are employed over Winter! )Both on the island & on the ferry. Bicycles & all a person's gear were taken on board for free. Free trolleys available at jetty to transport your gear. You must take all your needs with you- no shops. Water on tap. We took bread rolls,fruit & nuts & thermoses.I saw no rubbish bins - take it home with you . We caught the 10:30 am ferry & returned on the 4pm .Watching videos in the Commissariat Store  ( good shelter & activity if weather poor ). Had tea at the white pub near the jetty. Nice food but felt it was dear. Lovely friendly , helpful staff . Go early if a busy weekend like Queens Birthday as pub doesn't have many tables. You might try the Art Gallery cafe opposite chemist. Seems new . Could be better value . There are two pubs , one on the highway. I am enthused to return in Summer & swim & cycle & snorkle.Colourful life under the water at the jetty . Parts of the waters are a Marine Reserve .So much natural beauty, Australian history & uncommercialized environment .Not just another National Park . You need aTasmanian National Parks membership too. Can get  membership on the island. (?) Go & enjoy .  You can volunteer to help on projects around the island.  Volunteers were white washing buildings while we were there .Let's hope Triabunna can cope & grow but not to the extreme end of the commercial market .  Jill"
I spent a day on Maria Island and it was delightful. Steeped in convict history and covered in all manner of wildlife. A high level of fitness is not required to wander around this island. You can do as little or as much as you want. Absolutely amazing to see wombats roaming around and grazing like sheep. A real joy to see them outside a zoo environment.Park pass required to visit here. Had a lovely journey over on the Maria Island Ferry.
"to truly enjoy this island park, be prepared to walk several miles. the classic figure 8 hikes to fossil cliffs and painted cliffs are worth it, especially the latter if you must choose. this double hike takes about 3 hours at a casual pace with picture taking. the reservoir walk took about 1 hour to take the circuit, and allow for a nice snack and water break at the mid-point on the reservoir. there are more hiking options which get you to historic buildings and more rugged terrain heading up the mountain. everything was interesting and yes, the promise to see wildlife was delivered on, especially toward the evening as the heat of the day diminished. keep the camera at the ready."
"Had a good look around the island, you can hire bike's they have different sizes available but probably a good idea to book ahead in the holiday season. No food available on the island so take whatever you think you need, take plenty of water but you can fill up there if needs be,Plenty of wildlife, good swimming, easy walking"
"Finally got to Maria Island and it is amazing. The ferry ride is easy and there is plenty of time to do walks until the trip home. We did the Fossil Cliffs, Reservoir and Painted Cliffs and didn't need to rush. The island is full of wildlife including Cape Barren geese and wombats. Take everything you need as there is not much for sale. Ranger was very helpful. We will be back!"
"Beautiful island, nice ferry trip and amazing scenery. Be sure to hire a bike before you go, as there are limited options on the island. The ride along the coast is beautiful, but be careful if you take the inland path - it is ridiculously steep, rocky and muddy. If you're an experienced mountain biker it's probably very easy, but for anyone else it is thoroughly unenjoyable."
