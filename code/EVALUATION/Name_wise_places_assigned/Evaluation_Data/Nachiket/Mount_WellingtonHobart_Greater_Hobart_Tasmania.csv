"We went up to the summit with Hobart Shuttle Bus, $30 tour the ultimate trip and it was fantastic. A must do on your visit to Hobart, worth every cent. Guide was fantastic, views were sensational, bus was comfortable. felt very safe at every point  throughout the tour. Highly recommend"
"Bus up the mountain, freewheel down!Great way to see the scenery. Very exciting at times! Loved it."
Took a tour bus from Hobart to the Pinnacle at Mount Wellington and would highly recommend. Beautiful views down to Hobart CBD and surrounds
So worth it. Took hop on hop off bus. Really good deal. Beautiful views. Commentary on the bus was great. We had half an hour to roam at the top. Just right.
"we had a beautiful Coach ride from the information centre at Hobart up to the top of  Mt Wellington the coach driver very knowledgeable and funny, no snow that day and is the only coach that will go though the gates if they are closed during snow.as they have the exclusive requirements to be able to drive in up to 1 meter of snow. be prepared is an excellent look over the town the only walking you need to do is from bus to lookout."
"Was very cold & windy during our visit - Awesome lookout over Hobart, good to see a nice weather shelter with informative posters, toilets etc. Fairly easy access, well worth visiting for a look."
"Really good to visit, great view of Hobart. Wear warm clothes. It was freezing the middle of Summer. Take the bus tour. The driver was great."
Enjoyed the view from Mount Wellington but didn't stay long as it was cold and very windy. Was recommended to go out onto the boardwalk and wasn't  disappointed. Spectacular view. Even in November you need to rug up.
Ended up cycling up this mountain. Took around 50mins. Fairly challenging. View from the top is well worth the effort! Then a beer after hehe
Love this place. Have been up in Summer and Winter. Amazing views over Hobart. Got to experience snow.
Flew in at lunch and grabbed a car and headed up the mountain. What a wonderful surprise divine views and a stubby breeze that took the heat from the day. Meditated on some rocks facing north with the winds washing away the days flights .
Self drive up was easy and the view.. wow. We even got to play in a little snow. Bring your extra jacket as it was so cold.
"Went to tour Mt. Wellington, with a tour company, Hobart Tours, the driver cum guide was knowledgeable and cheerful, he had lots of jokes, made the tour interesting, good tour company to recommend, Mt. Wellington was nice and cool in summer,good views and facilities. Good experience."
"Went up the top on a clear cold morning & there was still snow about. Views sensational, information centre great (& sheltered)."
"Must visit first, before you try any other tours. Gives you an idea of Hobart landscape - helicopter view."
Well worth the long coach ride up the road. Absolutely beautiful views of Hobart. Check the weather first. It’s usually 15 degrees cooler at the top. Also if it’s cloudy or rainy you’re wasting your time going up there.
Went to show the visitors the view... The road up the mountain really needs an upgrade. Our tourists were sure they were going to die when one car took a corner a little too widely.
"On a cold, wet & very windy day we were driven to the top of Mount Wellington. Good job as apart from the freezing cold & driving rain the gusts of wind were approaching gale force it seemed. Once in the observatory all is forgiven. Allowed to dry out & warm up, the views are incredible. There is a telescope provided which helps. As a free attraction I would strongly recommend it."
"A beautiful sunny day, awesome days climb and spectacular view from the roof of Hobart.  Take the time to hike the Mountain and you will enjoy it even more than a drive."
"Drove to the wind and cold too for awesome views, then walked down for 2 hrs in the shelter. Took the shuttle bus back to the top to get the car. Well sign posted and great tracks"
"I took a mainland friend to the summit of Mount Wellington/kunanyi to see the amazing vistas of southern Tasmania and Hobart. Being Summer, there are crowds of people, so take the first available car park if driving. Take a jacket and other warm clothing also as it’s much cooler than Hobart city and can be very windy. The drive to the summit requires care as roads are narrow, winding, and busy. The views are breathtaking and superb. Well worth the time and effort. Great photo opportunities!"
"Headed up the hill on Sunday morning but only got as far as Ferntree due to a bicycle race, so down to Margate Beach for breakfast (terrific). Finally got to head up to the peak around 11am and the drive is not for the faint hearted - narrow road and steep drops on the side. Got to the top where the wind was blowing at about 40knots and the temperature had dropped remarkably (to 10 c). Great views but not a place for t shirts and shorts."
"Loved Mt Wellington...  it was pretty cold and windy, but still worth the trip up there.  A great place to go on our 20th Wedding Anniversary...  will be very memorable."
Interesting drive to the top. Gives great view of Hobart and the harbour. Remember to rug you tho as does get breezy up there
Just don't miss an opportunity to go up Mt Wellington. Best views of Hobart and surrounding landscape. Lovely wild flowers along the way especially in Spring. Feels like the top of the World. Sheltered Lookout and Info & Rest Rooms but no Café as yet. Really worth the time to go and see.
"Drive up a steep narrow road. Plenty of parking, lots of different vantage points to take pictures.Also stops along the way to take more pictures."
We drove here from Hobart. Nice drive with little bends and curves up the mountain (good for people with travel sickness).  The mountain has toilets and a beautiful lookout across Hobart.  Photos don't really don't it justice. You get a real sense of how large the Derwent River is.  There are history plaques around the lookout which outlines the history of climbers/hikers and settlement. Try and pick the day you go. The mountain is usually in cloud cover which inhibits the view. The mountain lookout attracts a lot of tourists and buses. We went around lunch time and avoided the crowds. The Cascade Brewery is at the base of the mountain which is a good place to visit after the Mountain. Recommended whist in Hobart.
"We were looking forward to the views from the top and enjoyed the drive up, stopping once or twice to look at the city below.  Unfortunately, before we were able to reach the summit the weather closed in and the view was lost in a cold, damp cloud.  Try to go when the sun shines."
Drive up is a bit frightening but the view is worth it! Very windy on top and busy with people. Best to go in the early morning or late afternoon and make sure you have a scarf..
Drive up was a little harrowing but well worth it in the end. Spectacular views and informative displays.Went on a clear day and you can see for miles. Not too busy and amenities available
"We had our own vehicle to drive up to Mount Wellington.  The drive itself is interesting. You realise you are going high as the weather changes as you are driving up.  The day we went it was extremely windy and cold once we got to the top so we did not stay long.  Rushed to be inside the building at the top so we could enjoy the views of Hobart in comfort, which were spectacular."
"Made the drive up to the Mt Wellington lookout. The views are amazing from the top. Be warned that its cold and windy at the top, but totally worth it."
"30 minute Switch Back Road to top for magnificent views of Hobart and environs.  But the winds on the day I was there practically knocked me off my feet, despite that fact that I still maintain my NFL Linebacker Physique.  Ordinary people had to hang on to whatever they could grab.  Thank god they've built a glass observation building, because it was impossible to stand outside.  A downhill mountain bike tour was set to launch, but there was no way they could ride till they descended to the tree line."
"A steep hike or run if you want to walk up the mountain. We decided to drive. View from the top is spectacular. Take a jacket because it is cold up there. Appreciate the labour that were used to build the road up the mountain, all done by hand. A must do when you visit Hobart."
"Have been lots of places seen lots of scenic views and I don’t thinks we have seen anything as majestic as this. Even on a slightly cloudy, hazy day it took the breath away."
