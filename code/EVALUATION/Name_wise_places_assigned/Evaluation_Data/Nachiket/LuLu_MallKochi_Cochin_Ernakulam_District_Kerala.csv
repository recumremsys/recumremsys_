"Yes a vast mall with all brands. Went on Dec 25, it was crowded. Good food court with local food available as well. The mall is same as most other good malls, only it is spread over a much bigger area.Worth a visit if you are in Kochi."
"Visited here a couple of times during a 12 day stay.  Lots of shops and places to eat, very busy at certain times. Also has small rides on top floor and very good priced."
This is a huge mall and definitely different to the other bigger malls in Chennai or Bangalore or Delhi. The range is quite vast and the Food court is exceptional. Watch out for the parking marks in ensuring not to search for your car after shopping :) It s location is quite out of the busy trafficked roads and relaxing.
"Biggest mall in India. Lot of options for shopping, movies, dining and entertainment. Lulu mall is the best option for family outing. Nice shopping experience. Variety of homemade chocolates, and chips. Be careful about the money management, as that's the only thing you will get amazed at the end of the day. Know where to get things done n keep a plan in mind, rather than roaming around and end up shopping anywhere. Must visit."
Super mall with giving importance to cleanliness. We will get everything under one roof. Full air-conditioned mall is an added advantage. All the shops maintained clean. Connect is the attraction in this mall. Children's play area also super. Biggest mall in the town. Access to…
It is a very big mall with a large variety of shops and food options. There is also a  hypermarket there. Make sure you visit it during your trip to Kochi!
"One of phenomenal malls in India, international of its size and popularity. I went out with family for movie and dinner.  PVR cinemas is top class.  Really enjoyed the movie.  Also had food from such a huge food court,  with great options.  Was surprised to see the food court completely packed. Lots of shops with variety.  Best place for electronic goods, groceries and fashion too.  Amazing place,  you will get everything there.  But during offer times,  it is almost impossible to get in there with four wheeler. Such is the popularity of this place."
"This mall is apparently there biggest in India and houses all major brands. No doubt the mall is large, but it also is quiet popular among the local populace. Remains reasonably crowded most of the time. Reaching the mall is easy when you opt for the metro service. You have to…"
"This is one place we as family visit at least once in a month. Being one of the biggest malls in South India in addition to being the biggest in Kerala this is one place were you will get almost everything you want. It has all world brands available in India.  The  Lulu Hypermarket is a great place to shop for your house hold items . It will get really crowded in the evening time especially on weekends ,so I urge you to go check in the Hypermarket in the morning hours. The ground floor has a a lot of gold and diamond showrooms . First floor is mainly for the women and the 2nd floor for the men... Although not strictly in that way. The top floor is the food court and has a large area owned by the Sparkeys were you get small rides in addition to all those vedio games that is usually seen in these type of malls. The foodcourt boasts of brands like KFC and Pizza hut in addition to those authentic keralite Hyderabadi and north Indian food.Each floor has its own comfort rooms and feeding rooms . There is the lulu connect for all the electronic items . 9 screens of PVR shows malayalam, hindi, english, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Punjabi movies."
"Great shopping facilities, Totally nice international Mall experience. Almost All items for living under a single roof. Quality of products are very high. The food items sold at Lulu is of high quality,fresh,that  at a moderate price. Have a very good vehicle parking facility.…"
"Located very conveniently on the highways of Cochin, and very near to a Metro station, this massive mall is sure to catch even the most unaware of eyes. And no points for guessing here, it surely is a paradise for shoppers- exactly what it was supposed to be! We have been to a lot of big sprawling malls all over India, but this takes the cake. And here you will find retail outsets of almost all the major brands across all possible product types. And one more thing which is worth mentioning, is that the pickup and drop points of app cabs are convenient and there is enough space for the same. All in all, it is a great place to be from a shopper's perspective! Honestly, we could not visit the entire mall due to paucity of time, since we had a return flight to catch. But if we come to Cochin again, we are surely coming back here!"
"We visited LuLu Mall in cochin on our last day in Kerala. LuLu Mall is a nice mall with variety of western and Indian fashion stores. We had 2 hours only, in our trip,  to roam around. If you have spare time, then visit this mall. SEE photos"
Large mall with everything under one roof. From restaurants to bookshop. Try the Briyani restaurant and also buy lots of cheap books. 
"Went by metro. There was a direct access from the metro station. Easily approachable, huge....but coming from Mumbai, it was very much like one of the malls there...."
The Middle East influences in planning and execution are visible here. Apparently it is the larges mall in India in terms of area. Very well designed and executed you can easily spend a good amount of time here for shopping and entertainment. The play area and the ice rink are amazing. The food option are superb too. Bound to find something you like as it caters to every type of requirement. Should visit if you have the time.
"Wonderful place to while away the time. Lots of branded shops and Jwellery stores. Avoid going on weekends, it’s the most popular place for local people to spend their holiday. The hyper market is the biggest and the best. You can buy all kinds of vegetables and fruits, local…"
"One of my preferred mall in Kerala ! The ambience and toilet facilities is amazing (though lately i.e. yesterday, the toilet on the ground floor has been closed due to maintenance). I always make a stop at Hypermarket, McD and Coldstone when I'm here. Do check out the mall if you're in Cochin."
Huge Mall . Good movie theater. Good support staff and amneties for toddlers. Has entertainment for all ages.The shop products are relatively expensive. The Lulu HMART in ground floor have good products and some with Amazing prices and offers.
Liked the hyper market. Very large and has lots of food vareties . Quality and variaety is excellent.
"Huge Mall, probably the biggest in India. One can easily while away hours and hours here. Try the arcade and amusement area upstairs.....Well to ""amuse"" yourself."
it's very crowded on weekends. sat 11.30am picked a few dresses and waited for more than half hr for the trial room. Hypermarket is well stocked. check out the new flavours in roasted cashew and peanuts. can find all the branded shops.If you have the time and patience you will definitely get what you are looking for.
Cochin has it's world class mall in LuLu Mall. International brands rub shoulders with Indian brands like Westside and local brands like MCR. The Hypermarket experience is truly international. The assortment of merchandise is truly fabulous. Lu Lu. Celebrate for value for money…
"Visited this place n no.of times for Movies, Dining , Shopping. Irrespective of the huge crowds the mall is kept very clean. Restrooms are neat. Dining areas are cleaned sooner."
Very good mall. Very good upkeep. Not very rush on the day we gone some children had come on picnic. Spacious. Visited hyper marketThe hyper market is one place you get all things
Not s single staff member could give definite and concise directions to shops within Lulu. Cleaning staff literally play fighting in the bathrooms. Other than that this place was great. Could use interactive information system to help shoppers find their way around. I've never been to a mall so nice but with such old antiquated boards for information.
"Apparently the largest mall in India, Lulu Mall offers a great variety of shops, an area for kids, a small fun park and great food options. The place is very clean, not too crowded and seemed well managed. Recommended if you have extra time in the city and need to do some last…"
Located at Edappally Near to Ernakulam with good access by Kochi Metro. One of the biggest shopping mall in India. All major brands. Good food court and children's play area too
"A big, clean mall with a sizeable number of shops. Perhaps one of the key highlights in Kochi. Reasonable rates and you can everything you need from groceries to toileteries, clothes, ethnic wear etc with some famous brands all under one roof. Saves you the time of going to…"
Middle class families can do only window shopping. The car parking rates should be reduced. Security system not upto world class. Hypermarket items quality is going down. Was good in the first three years.
This Mall has been over-hyped for everything. Extremely crowded on Weekends and very much crowded during the week days. PVR has 9 Screens and you get to see all latest releases of all languages. Recommended to visit ONLY if you have specific needs for shopping / movie.
"Ok, it's the biggest mall in SE Asia, so they say. Be e n to plenty in Bangkok that seem big too.  We were struck by how clean and well maintained it was.  Everything was spotless.  If you want sanitised shopping go for it!"
"Went there with our toddler. Place is extremely family-friendly, pram are available for rent and there are play areas for small kids and an entertainment centre for children of all ages. As for shopping, Lulu supermarket offers a broad range of products needed for everyday use. A must visit place if you are in Cochin."
