"Middleton Place and Gardens are beautiful, historic and informative.  Stroll the National historic gardens,  tour the plantation house, lunch at the restaurant and listen to the many docents who are highly knowledgeable on topics such as slavery, barrel making, history, spinning of yarn and other aspects of plantation life.  It is a very pastoral setting with sheep grazing, horses and carriage rides,  learning about rice production and of course beautiful views of the Ashley River. I would highly recommend a visit for visitors of all ages."
"Had a great ride through the rice fields and around the waters (ponds, rivers, etc.  Saw an alligator, large turtle in our path, blue herons and snowy egrets.  Guide was great, horse was fine.  It was 98°, but riding in the shade with a gentle breeze was a great experience.The equestrian facility is “to die for” with beautiful, well maintained dressage arenas, an event course, hosting a foxhunt, stadium jumps.  I highly recommend!"
"A must see. Absolutely beautiful grounds. Beautiful place to spend the morning or afternoon walking around the property. Take the tour inside the house and be sure to have lunch at the restaurant. It's 16 miles outside Charleston. We didn't have a car during our stay so we used Uber. May take little longer for driver to get there to pick you up, but it worked fine for us. Of course there are tours that take you there, but we prefer not being on someone else's time table."
"One immediately feels the peace and beauty of Middleton Place.  The large reflecting pool with its pair of graceful, white swans surrounded by flowering plants and trees with Spanish Moss evokes a bygone era of gentility. The guided tour of the last remaining building (there is an extra fee for this upon admission) affords insight as to what it the gentry lived like in those times. It was quite interesting to learn that Henry Midddleton's son, Arthur, signed the Declaration of Independence. Also, the various signs, educational posters and Eliza's house also give credit to the tremendous role the enslaved African Americans played in building and running the plantation.  The walking tour of the gardens is strongly recommended and it is included in the admission. It is highly informative and covers all the highlights of Middleton place.  It is also recommended that you wear comfortable walking shoes and leave  three - to-four hours for the tours and walking around the grounds.  Be sure to visit the restaurant.  The views are beautiful and the she-crab soup was one of the better versions in the region. We visited during the Christmas market, which was also fun."
Structured and manicured gardens with pathways through the azaleas and a huge camellia garden.  Terrace and old water mill and other interesting historic features.
"Middleton Place more than met our expectations!  Beautiful gardens, a wonderful restaurant, and lots of farm animals!  But we were most impressed with our tour guide, Bruce Georgi!  Bruce took us back in time!  The 1 1\2 hour tour, which is included with General admission, was filled with so many interesting facts that the time flew by!  Step back in time and visit this amazing place!"
"The Grounds are larger than I expected, but so beautiful to stroll around on.  We were the on July 4th and the interpreters were wonderful.  They have us an understand about what the plantation might have looked like back there.  We love the Cooper!  He looked like he walked right out of time.  We walked through the stables where the giant horses were happily munching away on their dinner.  The grounds are so beautiful, plan to just relax and stroll.  Make sure you make it back to The Middleton Oak, it's just huge!"
"We love the outdoors, taking pictures, learning some history and especially gaining knowledge and ideas for landscaping. What a wonderful place to visit.  Our entire time was spent on the grounds. There were a few baby and bigger gators. We have tours 3 other plantations in Charleston and a 2-3 outside of Richmond.  MIddleton Place is a massive plantation and all flowers were in bloom.  One of the volunteers pointed out the orange azalea which we had never seen before. There is a gift shop and garden shop on the premises as well as carriage rides available. We spent 4-5 hours and it was time well spent for us and will be if you enjoy a peaceful day touring a magnificent place.  There are arrows that help guide visitors and there are important historical signs that honor the history of slaves who built the buildings and all the gardens.  The Mill House is historical, has pictures and also honors the slaves from West Africa who toiled to plant and harvest rice for the Middleton family. Rice was the crop of South Carolina  plantations.  Take the tour.  We previously toured Magnolia, Drayton and Boone Hall plantations."
"There is something for everyone.  The farm animals are great for kids.  The slave quarters and tour was very interesting.  Grace gave an amazing explanation of the plantation, and the slaves.  Free parking, restrooms, a gift shop, and the country store.  There is a small restaurant.  Go early, as it gets very hot in the afternoon."
Lots of walking.  Beautiful areas.  Enjoyed.  Go on a sunny day as the smells and views are great. Can’t say any more
"Billed as America’s first real tourist attraction, Middleton place is a beautifully landscaped area with loads of sculptured lawns, swamp forest trails, and lakes.  The home isn’t that impressive, since the main part of the home was destroyed during the Civil War.  Middleton also has craftsmen in period costume in the stable area doing demonstrations of crafts like weaving and blacksmithing.  The restaurant on-site is remarkably good, with a range of low country cuisine."
Loved this gem. Great place to stroll and consider the history of the south. We enjoyed the docent lead tours of the garden and the house. We enjoyed a fine meal while we were there.
"Set on the river a short drive from downtown Charleston the house is set in beautiful grounds and gardens. We followed an interesting tour of the house with a look round the historic farmyard and outbuildings where a number of artisans talked about their particular crafts. We then enjoyed a really excellent tour on the ""History of Slavery"", which was worth the admission price alone."
"Beautiful plantation with a lot to see.  Has a lovely restaurant as well as individuals explaining the kinds of tasks that were done centuries ago. ( milling corn, blacksmith, farming, etc.  Sculpured gardents are magnificent, the butter fly lake, and trees covered with Spanish moss over 500 years old.  You can walk or ride thru the planation. Gift shop also available."
"This is a beautiful plantation with some of the most lovely grounds and gardens in the south.  The ""home"" and several out buildings are well maintained and the staff is universally well versed in the history of the property and enthusiastic in sharing this information.  The 4th of July celebration was a great experience.  The live interpreters are excellent.  Do not miss the potter-she is outstanding.  Not only is she talented but she is an excellent teacher."
"Middleton Place has gorgeous gardens with a lot of history. The house tour explains a lot about the families who lived on the property, while the “beyond the fields” tour discusses the lives of the enslaved people who made the gardens and plantation a reality. The low country restaurant cannot be missed. Don’t chase the sheep and the alligators are real!"
"We visited here during wonderful weather in June 2019.  We took the carriage tour, house tour, and walked the gardens.  The carriage tour was lovely and we learned so much.  The house tour was very nice but my husband did not enjoy it.  I suppose when you compare it to Mt. Vernon, it is very similar.  They do have some very unique items inside and it is nice to see the family history.  The fact that the estate is still in the family makes the whole place even more special. The gardens were astounding.  When we visited the hydrangea were in bloom. The ponds, the moss covered trees.  I could have enjoyed the gardens all day.  The birds that other wildlife make the whole place somewhat magical.  The irony in this beautiful place, along the ponds and in the ponds are very visible alligators.  Don't let your little ones run about freely!  But, watching them in all that beauty is amazing.  I don't think I will ever forget it.  I will return in azalea season!"
"We were amazed at this place- actually older than Mount Vernon! So much history! We enjoyed the beautiful grounds with massive ancient oak trees, camellias, swans in the reflecting pool and even some (wild) basking alligators. Loved the barnyard animals and the house tour (although our tour guide could have had a little more personality!) Lunch in the charming restaurant was nice but my husband’s gumbo was way overpriced for very small serving."
"Relaxing, beautiful grounds-don’t miss the beyond the fields tour on slavery and especially the Kayak tour. Charleston Kayak company-Rare trip through the cypress swamps led by naturalist - will be signing up again for that activity for sure. Great way to relax-lots of interesting things that appeal to all ages- young kids even teens. Only downside is remembering the place was built on the backs of and by slaves. They are doing a better job of addressing this-through the tours and educational materials but still a ways to go. Definitely going to make this an annual trip."
"This was definitely a worthwhile day trip from Charleston.  Middleton Place has a wonderful mix of beautiful garden, plantation and stable yard.  Took the garden tour and Beyond the Fields talk.  Both were informative.  Plan to spend at least half a day to get the full experience.  Off season was a nice time visit with fewer crowds and cooler temps.  Paid only $25 by combining it with Palmetto Carriage day tour In Charleston"
"The grounds are lovely, so much to see and we really appreciated so much history presented, especially concerning slavery and the slaves skills, talents and what life was really like for them during this time in our country’s history. Make sure you visit when you have several hours to spend so you don’t miss anything. In the slave’s village, there are skilled artisans demonstrating their skills, replicating work that would’ve been done during this period by the slaves. Also, fun to interact with the animals on the property."
My husband loves history and  I prefer nature. This place combines both in  a gorgeous setting with beautiful vistas and many picture opportunities. The slavery tour was awesome and the guide extremely knowledgeable. Has farm animals of the time period and additionally a couple more. Also easily to spot alligators in the near Ponds and rivers. Didn’t get a chance to tour the house but have seen other mansions recently so we opted not to. We also did the farm animal tour.  Spent a couple of hours here and really enjoyed it was one of my highlights of our trip. An easy drive from Charleston .
"Took a booked tour to/from Charleston (Pineapple Tours).   So much to see (gardens, lake views, interpretation center (weavers, potters, candle makers, etc.).  House tour was very good.  Restaurant's buffet was excellent."
"The grounds, statues, and garden are lovely, but during the house tour we had a guide who was partially re-litigating the civil war, which we found deeply odd, as well as ignorant and offensive. Is this really the face that Charleston wants to present to the world?"
"This place is beautiful and well worth a visit.  The wagon ride is well worth it.  You see much more of the plantation and our driver was more like a tour guide, with a wealth of interesting information about the plantation and Middleton family.We also enjoyed the gardens and animals.  Plus the restaurant was really good.  I would skip the house tour, as it is very quick and you don't really get to look at much on display.  In addition, we were disappointed by the information in Eliza's House.  It seemed like a high level slavery gloss-over.  Perhaps the Beyond the Fields Tour, which we didn't have time to take, would have had more information.  We got more of a sense for the slaves at the Aiken Rhett House than at Middleton.In summary, go for the gardens, animals, carriage tour, and restaurant.  Do not go to get a better sense of slavery on a plantation."
"Visited from Colorado. The time was splendid, we met some great people that work at Middleton. The gardens are incredible. Would definitely go back, so much to see!"
"Our first  tour  with Chris, a master Gardener,  explained the French Formal Gardens. America's Oldest Lanscaped Gardens. They are amazing and were laid out by  André Le Nôtre, the master of classical garden , who planned Versaille in France! However late summer and fall lack the amazing blooms of the spring season.  We visited The Mill House on our own and read about  the slaves from West Africa  that  labored in the Middleton Rice plantation beside the Ashley River amidst insects, mosquitoes,  alligators and venomous snakes to plant, harvest, mill and deliver the crop to the Port of Charleston for export. Nicole, our narrator  on Beyond the Fields Tour likewise was very knowledgeable and informative regarding Slavery and the Eliza House near the Stables: Sheep , goats and horses are for the most part easy to interact with in their natural habitat.We also reserved and toured inside The Middleton House ; for the most part self guided but with a docent on each floor to answer questions about the Rooms, Middleton Family Ancestry,  Furnishings  and artifacts. Walking the grounds on our own , we observed an alligator sunning itself, egrets (white herons) strutting and flying, magnificent live oak trees and plants.  Driving back to the Inn at night after dinner, a wild sow was leading  her three little piggy s through the low country terrain.."
Definitely worth the trip. Lots of fun things to see and do. I’d recommend skipping the house tour. It’s extra money and not worth it. The groups they take in are too large and the spaces inside are too cramped for that number of people to see everything and be comfortable. Do not skip the restaurant. We had the best she crab soup and fried chicken we’ve ever tasted! The view of the lake from the tables is very pretty. If you look closely you might catch some gators and turtles sunning themself on the bank of the lake.
"Visiting Charleston for the first time my husband and I wanted to see a Plantation and understand how people worked and lived there. Middleton Place offered a trifecta to experience: beautiful gardens, original house “museum” tour, and a world class restaurant for a most memorable lunch! They also have outside stables for the farm animals (yes there are many still there) and Eliza’s house which documents the life of slaves on plantation who later lived as freemen in that house. We booked with Pineapple Tours which included R/T transportation in luxury minibus with video (about Middleton) from downtown Charleston. The driver also provided background commentary on the plantation and history from back when it was operational. House tour was amazing and the lunch was so delicious. My husband had the shrimp gumbo which was chock full of many jumbo shrimp with delicious sauce and vegetables. I could not eat shellfish or the meats served on menu so the chef made a farm to table vegetarian dish with fresh okra, corn, eggplant, onions and rainbow baby carrots that was served in a garlicky risotto type rice with Parmesan cheese; totally exceeded my expectations! Even salad was amazing with shredded red and golden beets in wonderful dressing. Lemon tart with berry coulis was perfect ending to perfect meal!  Highly recommend this tour."
We really enjoyed seeing this plantation and it's beautiful grounds.  Well worth it.  And restaurant on site was great.  Do go...extremely interesting.
"Wonderful. Beautiful grounds. We came for a kayaking trip in the swamp, which was great. Stayed and walked the grounds. Beautiful well maintained landscape. Lots of history walking around. We did not pay for any tours. Great place to spend a day."
"We went for lunch - which was SPECTACULAR!  Then, toured some of the plantation.  There are guided tours that can be purchased above and beyond the general admission which includes several basic tours.  It can be quite a pricey visit if one adds on additional tours. I believe a whole day can be spent without purchasing the additional tours. We purchased the house tour.  This was very interesting.  We went rather late so we didn't have as much time as we would've liked to look at everything beyond the tour.  Going through the barnyard, a young lady was milking a cow!  She asked if I wanted to try &, of course, I did.  She was incredibly knowledgeable with lots of fun facts about the animals.  I really could have spent so much more time with her & I don't think she would've minded! I would not mind going back there for a longer time... especially if it is not hot!"
"We took the tour bus from Charleston which made for any easy arrival.  The gardens are simply wonderful.  Take you time exploring everything!   The house tour is interesting too.  We spent the better part of day enjoying/walking the grounds.   This was a really good day on our Charleston trip.  There is a place to have lunch on the grounds. It has a very limited menu. The food is not what you get inCharleston proper, but it is ok.  The high points are the grounds, house and tour staff."
"We went on the walking tour with a guide. Saw the slave quarters and rice fields. Found out that just 5% of the slaves from Africa landed in the United States. Sheep and other farm animals are just wandering around the grounds. This plantation is right on the Ashley River outside of Charleston, SC."
Had perfect weather for our visit .Ambled the grounds . Saw the animals and had an informative tour with Mary.Good lunch at the restaurant. Delicious She Crab Soup.It is a bit expensive though and for a family of four would imo be cost prohibitive.
