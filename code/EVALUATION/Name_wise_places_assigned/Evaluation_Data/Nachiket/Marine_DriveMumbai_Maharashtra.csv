One must see and experience Marine Drive. Beautiful sea view and chilling place in mumbai. Spending evening is must.
Pleasant place to hang out and relax during sunset. Good place to see Mumbai life. Avoid going in the afternoon.
Visit the place in the evening. The sea view is best and most clean.  Enjoy the scenery with Bhelpuri  and similar things .
Fun place to be with family and friends. Long walk way good exercise. Didn't find any mischief mongers
Stayed at the Oberoi Mumbai. Loved the view from our suite   Loved the vibe of the area. Our driver enlightened us as to the beauty and use of the area around the drive
Marine Drive is a beautiful place in Mumbai. One can sit down and relax near the sea. The view of city skyline from Marine Drive is breathtaking. Enjoy the sound of water and wind in this place.This is also a good place to click photos.
Seen on my tour with Magical Mumbai Tours. An amazing way to see the skyline - incredible panoramic views. Wish I could go back around sunset.
Watching sunset on marine drive is amazing. You can walk for a hour with beautiful sea view and feel great! Only missing part was absence of local vendors with amazing local food.
"A beautiful place for giving a rest to our mind . Sitting alone with your favourite song  and the fresh air blows on you with noticing the waves . An , enjoyable place . You should visit this place with your friends and family it's a wonderful place . This place has a lot of aesthetic value . With regards , Youngest_traveller_"
The Marine Drive is a must visit if one is visiting Mumbai.The entire curve seems like a necklace and it is best viewed at sunset. Take a taxi or travel by local train to churchgate .It's walking distance from th station .
Take a stroll down the Queens Necklace in the last hour or two before dusk ... see Mumbai's young and those who are tretching their legs. All of Mumbai is to be seen here!
"An approximately 5 km walkway an the shore of the Arabian Sea, overlooking parts of northern Mumbay. A lovely place to start or and your day. Don’t miss it!"
We went around by 8:00pm after dinner. Walking by seaside feeling the sea breeze. Clean O2 air. Hundreds walking by.
"My favourite place in Mumbai. Have walk on this promenade any hours of the day. One of the safest places in Mumbai. Also know as Queens Necklace for the street lights in the center of the C shaped road. If you want to watch the most beautiful sunset, this is the place. Red Sun going into the Sun is worth watching. If you are visiting Mumbai must spend some time here."
"It’s a nice corniche, with lovely views of the city and the Arabian Sea.  Given how hot it is in Mumbai, it would be nice it there were more shade trees along the way.  Also, there are not really places to stop and grab a drink right along the way."
"Crowded throughout the day. More scenic in daytime than night. Skyline is like the usual city but not well-lit at night. Overall, I would say worth going only during day time."
Was driven along this stretch by the guide. Absolutely beautiful. Full of colour and families. Clean.
Nice place to spend your evening with your close ones. Been here couple of time during my stay in Mumbai. One side you see the Seaside and busy traffic on the other
Don’t miss this n one of your tours of Mumbai to the south. The locals still call this area Bombay and they are sticking to that name with a great deal of pride.  The streets here are as clean as those in Singapore and equally as safe.
"Walking on the shores of the sea in marine drive is the best thing one could do to kill time in Mumbai. It is a place for photo loving people, here one could easily spend time clicking photos with the setting sun and the sea ."
"Marine Drive also known as the Queens necklace is definitely a must go zone if you are in Mumbai. The view of the sea along with corn or tea to relish your throat  just adds up to the beauty of the place. Visit during the day may turn out hot and sweaty unless it's rainy. According to my experience, late night visit is really peaceful, calm and quiet. Since, the traffic and crowd is minimum at night so the place becomes more relaxing. Hope this help you all. Have fun!!!"
One of the most visited places in Mumbai that is famous across India . This place is simply amazing go there be it any time of the day during the week it will always offer a new experience. I looks like a queen necklace in night . Be it a morning run or night out with your friends or a walk with your special ones by the side of the sea this place never disappoints you.
"Walk along the sea front is a nice way to spend a weekend morning.  Evenings brings everyone out to enjoy the seaside.  Good place to just walk and enjoy.  Spend a few moments or all day here, it's up to you."
Went here around 6.30 and found a place to sit on the ledge. We got a very beautiful view of the sunset and had a very relaxing time here.
"Being a local, I have been to Marine Drive many a times and never get bored. The Marine Drive starts from Nariman Point at South end and ends at Chowpatty in the North. It's about 3-4 km drive. Although the drive can be pleasant the real pleasure is seating and enjoying the sunset. The esplanade is crowded most of the time, but you wouldn't mind the crowd and can enjoy the views with some snacks sold by hawkers."
I would recommend visiting this place just before midnight. Warm tea with the midnight stars and street lights hit u in a different way. Bring out the love for mumbai
"Marine drive if observed from height looks like a necklace and hence is called queen's necklace also. It has got a very positive vibe. You can enjoy even if you come here all by yourself. Take a stroll on the long promenade from churchgate to charniroad or simply sit on the promenade sitting area to view the wide expanse of Arabian sea, enjoyment is guaranteed! So many people flock here - joggers, friends, couples, groups, singles, locals, foreigners, young and old. All come with different mood but go back with positivity and smile!"
"Marine Drive is a must visit not just for Non Mumbaikars but also for every Mumbaikar residing in the different and long , extended stretches of the city. As you sit on the shore, if facing the sea you can witness sunset and the beautiful hues that colour the sky each evening. You also get to see the finest buildings of South Mumbai alongside the long coast. Wait till sunset and witness the street lights adorn the entire stretch and then you will probably understand why it is also known as the queens necklace. And if you sit facing the road with the sea behind you, what you will witness is the rushing & honking of cars each wanting to drive faster than the other. You will also find people going for their daily walks and some jogging as well.  It is the place that has a clear divide between chaos and peace with you  in the centre with the option of choosing from both. There are also very few hawkers these days. Best time to visit is 6 pm onwards to visit the sunset or in the rains, with the waves splashing water all over the shore too. Especially in monsoon, If you are lucky, you may find a hawker selling fresh hot corn cobs."
Watching the sunset from Marine Drive is one of the best memories I take with me from Mumbai. Simply stunning.
"Went here during my short trip to Mumbai. I was told that this is one of the most popular spot in the city. Indeed, even in the afternoon, there were people sitting around & taking pictures. The view from here is very nice. One can see the expanse  towards the Arabian Sea & feel the sea breeze."
Visited in the evening when the place was all lit up and the lights on the sides of the long smooth road looked like golden beads of a necklace. The sea is very calm and the steamers which were lighted up for Naval day celebrations looked beautiful. It is a nice place to have a long romantic walk or just sit and enjoy the view.The tall swanky buildings add to the grandeur.
"in the daytime, the area is very quiet but it comes alive at night. go to the beach and try the street food"
"On 22nd Sep'19, a fine Sunday evening, myself with my hubby visited Marine Drive - glamour & glitter of the city. Marine Drive is actually 3.6 km long, arc-shaped boulevard along the South Mumbai coast that starts at the southern end of Nariman Point and ends at Girgaum Chowpatty, popularly known as Chowpatty BeachWe had a relaxed walk there in the evening. It was more crowded due to weekend. The sound of the waves, a view of the Mumbai skyline and the starry sky easily make Marine Drive one of the most romantic spots in the city. Enjoyed the pleasant evening at this romantic spot."
"I went with my friend in March 2019 at around 11.30 night. It was very crowded, completely safe for girls. loved it"
Make sure that someone else is driving. You won't want to miss the stunning views of the bay and the city. Or you can leave your vehicle behind and enjoy a leisurely jog or a stroll along the broad sidewalk.
