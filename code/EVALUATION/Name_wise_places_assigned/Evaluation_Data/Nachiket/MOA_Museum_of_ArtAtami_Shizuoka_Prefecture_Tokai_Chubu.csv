"A place where you have to visit if you are in Atami. Not for the exhibits, but for the scenic views and the awesome food in the restaurants up there.A short bus ride with easy instructions at the bus stop. Prepare spare change no bigger than 1000yen.Keep quiet on the bus.Silent your phone.And enjoy the view up and down and while you are up there. The view is breathtaking and soothing...Staff everywhere within the museum is very friendly and helpful too.If budget allows, choose one from the restaurants and have a hearty meal there. The soba was excellent and among one of the few things we still remember after the trip...."
Visited there on a hot humid summer day. Surely you can hide from it at that spacious museum. The number of exibitis is not that big but worth seeing.
You can feel the spirit of a true Japanese whether through old pictures. Art objects. Thriving beautifully.
"This museum is nestled on a hillside, in a beautiful forested setting with great views. Wonderful exhibits. Reminded us of the Getty campus in LA. Also, lovely Japanese garden and tea houses. If you want to have a full meal get to the restaurant earlier than the published closing time. They were out of the meals we wanted and although the food was fine, we ended up with a bunch of miscellaneous items the chef had available. Also, there apparently are live kabuki theater performances. If we had known, we would have scheduled our visit for that day. Unfortunately, we missed it and it looked like it would have been awesome in the small intimate theater there."
"I have been visiting MOA for 30 years. Each time I travel to Atami MOA is a stop. Note the museum is closed for renovation until February of 2017. This museum is said to have been founded by a Japanese whose lifetime passion was aesthetics. The legend has it that he once sold his house to acquire a Japanese bowl. Arguably the longest underground escalator in the world takes you up the hillside, built to avoid destruction of the trees. The garden is home to a Moore sculpture and breathtaking view of the city. In the museum you will find paintings by Rembrandt and Monet and magnificent east Asian works, including 3 Japan National Treasures and 61 Cultural Properties. My partner and I have enjoyed a concert performance here and viewed a splendid golden tea ceremony room."
"Very impressive postmodern building with many escalators and enough space for exhibits to stand out.  Loved the Henry Moore King and Queen sculptures in the garden, sets the mood for the whole modernist approach, though the traditional is not at all negelcted, as they had a Noh theatre on display.  Pity that the enthusiastic lady guide cold only explain the details in japanese which leaves the foreign visitor at a  loss as there were no pamplets in english.  they did provide a detailed English translation for the illustrated legend in ten chapters, or was it nine? Like the Golden Tea Room too, the sumptuousness capturing the importance of the emperor and lords who served him.  Nice mix of European art, too, as Rembrandt's self-portrait in his youth was displayed along with Monet and other French artists.  The Chinese pottery, mainly from the Ming and Song dynasties also made absorbing viewing.Thought it was very good to have a public bus shuttling visitors from the Atami Station right up to the Museum, makes it so accessible."
"Great medium size museum situated in a park with unique architecture built into the mountainside with fantastic views of Suruga Bay and a Henry Moore sculpture facing the bay. Heading up to the main entrance are four flights of escalators with different colors. Interior of the museum is very spacious with two floors of galleries with 17th & 18th century exhibits of art, calligraphy, ceramics and lacquer boxes. The exhibits are well displayed with English explanations.At the time of our visit, the museum had an exhibition of children’s artwork from 2nd to 5th or 6th grades, which was very impressive and very talented kids.If you arrive in Atami by JR train, turn left when you exist the station and head up the ramp to bus bay #8 for MOA Museum of Art. It’s about a 10 mins bus ride uphill; fare is 170 Japanese yen p/p. You can walk but it is a steep uphill walk."
"After reading all the reviews I went with high expectations and it still exceeded my expectations! Loved the layout of the museum too - it's like they're taking you through a journey. You go through all these escalators through somewhat zen-like tunnels (loved the floor with the kaleidoscope ceiling where you can just sit back on comfy chairs and stare).I am not an art enthusiast but I really enjoyed the collection in this museum and the architecture plus the garden outside (at the end of the route). There are quite a few cafes and restaurants too. I tried the cafe overseeing Atami, and the French bread with mentaiko paste was amazing! Inexpensive as well (the restaurants seemed a tad expensive though). Just a 7 minute ride (170 yen) from Atami Station and the admission is 1600 yen for adults (worth every penny!)."
"Depending on the exhibits, the collections that you can view will differ, so refer to their homepage before visiting.  Great location with a superb view of the bay and ocean.  Beautiful garden with many choices of high quality restaurants.  You can spend a few hours and enjoy the whole atmosphere at this museum.  For more, refer to ""hiddenjapanguide"""
