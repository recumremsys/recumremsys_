Very interesting and free visit. Full of history and on the bus route. Highly recommend . allow at least 1.5 hours plus.
My surprise as free entry to the museum.  So much to see and very interactive.  Great for kids too with the kids activity area.  Setting for the museum is wonderful and great just to go down and look at the water too.
There is lots to see and the displays are well presented. Allow about 2 -3 hours if you like to read all the information about the various displays.
Free entry and open daily. Well put together museum and galleries. You can Lear a lot about the native wildlife and the cyclone TRACY exhibit was very well done. Make the time and learn a little about the top end.
"The art and exhibits here are quite interesting and very NT. Enjoyed a leisurely stroll in air conditioned comfort, entertained and educated by the NT story and the indigenous birthright of of our country. However, The museum and gallery, housed in a wonderful building, could be so much more than it is. Maybe with time and funding."
"What a beautiful museum/ gallery to visit.  Thank you for having us. Great selection of local indigenous art, local attractions and exhibitions.  Great souvenir shop.  Such amazing staff.  So helpful. Congratulations."
"You must visit Museum while in Darwin to discover about early history,  and the effect of Cyclone Tracy, and many more interesting facts.  Could have spent a whole day there, allow plenty of time to  absorb.  Also have a meal there if desired, looking over the waters of the top end. Darwin is a place of many interests. Take a holiday to thee top end,"
Add this place to your list ! Very good and informative. Full size boats out back in the Maritime section. Wish we had more time.
Free activity- can give donation. Interesting for all ages. Great activity on a hot day as well air conditioned. Easy parking. Learnt a lot.
Highly recommend this museum.  Fabulous displays including the cyclone Tracey and the Moon and Stars. Allow yourself a few hours.  Friendly staff including the guy (sorry I have forgotten his name) who only works on a Thursday and explained a whole heap of bones/skeletons. We went twice and enjoyed it immensely. Highly recommend.
So much to see at this wonderful Museum and Art Gallery. Spend the time to look through all the galleries. Absolutely lovely cafe as well. All by donation (no entry charge). An absolute highlight of our trip to Darwin.
Spent a an interesting few hours here. Very well set out Museum. Free entry!! Also a good cafe with ocean view.
"Great way to spend a few hours, a mix of art and other exhibits. Take no 4 bus from the interchange and then a 5 min walk past the bowls club"
"An amazing gallery and museum even for non- museum people. The Cyclone Tracy exhibit is confronting and makes you appreciate how resilient humans can be . Listening to and hearing the actual wind footage of the day was eerily frightening , can not image actually being in it. Awesome artefacts - a great tourist attraction"
You will need a couple of hours to cover the historical exhibitions. Don't miss out on tbe maritime display of boats alongside.
"We spend a leisurely few hours here and enjoyed the permanent and special exhibitions. Don’t miss the maritime exhibit “out the back”, it is delightful and wonderfully presented."
Fantastic little gallery. Worth a visit. Don’t miss the maritime section. Great display of insects and animals. Fabulous lighting throughout the gallery. Very well done.
This museum is an interesting mix of social and natural history and art.  Cyclone Tracy story a must.  Other interesting parts include historical exhibits about Darwin’s early development. Allow 2 hours.  Nice cafe with great views as well.
Wonderful museum. Well set out. Loved it. A must do in Darwin and all for free   Very informative and loved the art work. They go to a lot of trouble here.
Just the Cyclone Tracey exhibit alone is well worth the visit. I can’t believe it’s free. Be sure to make a donation.
"Stopped off here on hop on hop off bus trip, free entry to most of the museum.  So me exhibits have a fee but they were closed when we visited."
Just to see Sweetheart is worth the visit. Loved the cyclone Tracey exhibit as well as the moon one. The cafe and the verandah area was very shady.
"With friends in tow I was keen to show them this excellent Museum which has a variety of displays. They remembered too well Cyclone Tracy back in 1974, and understood more clearly the terror that Darwinites experienced on that occasion. Of course Sweetheart is always a drawcard, and it is difficult not to be impressed by the size of this crocodile. Our favourite area was the collection of boats of all sizes and belonging to different cultures. An excellent Museum to visit on any hot day, as it has excellent air conditioning. Great Gift Shop offering souveniers at very competitive prices. Congratulations on sustaining such a wonderful Museum which does not charge an entry fee! Allow at least 3 hours for a visit!"
"This display was very good. Nice cafe attached. Well worth catching the big red bus if you dont have a car. Quite a big display. Allow a couple of hours. Paintings. Displays on Darwin events, animals and local indigenous people and lots more"
"...and free entry to boot! I’ll state up front that I hope all of you add a few bucks to the donation box as you walk through. I particularly wanted to see the Cyclone Tracy display as I remember this from childhood. It was a well documented area and after walking through it all was prepared to go but got side tracked with the crocodile, the birds, the bones, the incredible number of boats from surrounding shores under the roof, and most impressively upstairs, the superb photographic representation of life in the Territory at the turn of last century. You should be charging and I hope people are generous! There is also a sizeable art section, though not an interest of mine and a children’s hands on area in the foyer next to the souvenir shop.You will find the Saltwater Cafe exiting from another door with coffee, cakes and lunch/ brekky menus. A verandah out front overlooking a grassed area to the water.  Not flash but enjoyable and very busy on weekends. There was a craft market there last Sunday. Noticed the double decker red ‘hop on/off’ buses pull up here. Plenty of parking if not competing with weekend & school holiday trade. Close to Mindil Beach market area."
"Looking to fill a hr or to we headed to the museum. Free entry in we went and wow. The first section is like a old school museum with display after display of every preserved insect bird reptile mammal in the territory. Then there was an indigenous section,a history of Darwin area, a cyclone Tracy area, a huge pavilion of boats from traditional trading vessels to pearling luggers and more.Three hrs later we left pleasantly surprised and ""educated"".This Darwin museum punches above its weight."
Love museums but this one is so modern and the displays are very well presented. Spent several hours there. Very good gift shop and friendly helpful staff.
Interesting small museum. We went to view the history relating to Cyclone Tracy which was very good. As usual there is also other interesting sections. Located a short walk to a boat ramp with nice water views
The Big Bus drops you off right at the door and what a fabulous museum - and its FREE ENTRY!   This would have to be the best musuem we have been to in Australia.  Great displays and reallly relevant to the region.  We needed two visits to see it all properly.  Allow at least 1 1/2 hrs to take it all in properly.
"Give yourself plenty of time to walk through, sit and listen, read exerps from newspapers about Cyclone Tracey, and so very much more. We had a light lunch there before we started which helped. A must see"
"Excellent displays and local history, including Cyclone Tracy exhibit. Loved the pioneer life area and pleasant surprise to come across some maritime exhibits as well. All nicely presented in modern facilities."
Got off the Hop On Hop Off bus to visit the museum. The frequency of the bus fit well with our visit. Seating while you wait. Found the Cyclone Tracy exhibit fascinating. Mother Nature at it’s scariest!We also enjoyed the maritime displays and the Transformations exhibit about the geological history and climates’ effect on flora and fauna. Worth a stop by!
"The variety of exhibits in this museum offers something for everyone.  Most impressive are the variety of birds, fish, lizards and reptiles presented in attractive and interesting displays.  Another room presents the catastrophic destruction of Darwin during Cyclone Tracy in 1974 using graphic displays.  A collection of photographs and artwork provide a great view into aboriginal life in not-to-distant past.  This museum is a real gem; well laid out and fun to visit.  It is hard to believe that it has no admission charge!!  Don't miss it!!!"
"Took the Hop on Hop off bus down to the gallery. What a great place. So much to look at covering the bombing of Darwin history, and also Cyclone Darwin covering the devastation of both events. The arts and crafts were great and included many Indigenous pieces from local tribes. A must see if you visit Darwin."
"Cyclone Tracey, different creatures and fauna found in Darwin and aboriginal art are able to be viewed and learnt here. Very interesting and with the visit. Is free to enter and free wifi."
