"I have been to this beach with my family and kids ! This is one beach which is centrally located from the town and accessible The kids and family both enjoys it as the beach is not been explored by too many people's and it's clean beach ! There are lots of stalls of fast food , restaurant  and hawkers with balloons and other kids accessories which is very good and keep the kids engaged There are few swings also and area where people can sit and kids can enjoy Don't get into the water further as it's quite deep and steep in and you will not be able to figure out the depth of the same ! Enjoy the beach and weather"
"Visited this beach with family. This beach is not crowded. There are no beach shacks, just a few vendors."
it is quite a clean beach. Boating experience was quite nice. not heavily crowded. only problem I faced was I couldn't find nice eateries in this beach
I have been visiting this beach since i was little. Have tons of memories at this place. A lot of tourists visit this beach as its so pretty. Situated right at the capital city of Goa its a lot easy to access as well
"Hi, on my many visits to Goa.. visit to this beach is always on cards. Located in panjim, the miramar beach has crowd at any time of the day."
"Miramar Beach in Goa is a favourite tourist attraction where one can find a lot of tourists on the beach or one can walk on the pavement in front of the beach as there are a lot of vendors selling paani puri, bhel puri, papdi chat where one can find a lot of people who want to have snacks. The beach is usually crowded and poorly maintained and can be a lot better.One can take a boat ride in mid day where one can go into the middle of the sea and spot dolphins if one is lucky. The boat ride lasts for an hour and costs 300 Rupees per person. Try to prefer a big boat instead of a small one and it's usually enjoyable if the music and songs played are not very loud and if it's not raining.Dr. Javed Rasheed"
"I have seen better beaches in the world and also in Goa that Miramar Beach I felt was okay. Rather you can visit the food truck outside the Miramar Beach, that is really nice. You getting everything in a very reasonable price. Try that out."
Good beach although Goa does have better ones. Was there for morning walk. Not too many people. Clean.
"Enjoyed a lot with my family. Very nearer to hotel Ginger. Also enjoyed the boat drive. The scenary, location was great."
This beach is brown and black. Overfilled with garbage and bad smelling. Swimming is not an option as there is garbage from the river flooding onto the beach.
Located in Panjim this beach is ok . Lot of food stalls indicating the popularity of the place. Sunset view was good.
Visited it during evening time and it was an amazing experience. Sitting in the sand near by the beach waters and viewing the sunset felt very good. There are food places and stalls near by so one does not need to worry about that. Loved it.
"This beach is located in the Panjim city. So it is very good beach in the main city. Surrounded by lush greenery this beach is very good for unwind and relax, as compare to other beaches it offers very limited activity. You can enjoy street food here. A perfect place for beach-walk."
One of the best beaches in Goa.. Neat and Clean..But that was not the thing that made me impressed..It was the kites flying high up in the sky.. We were so lucky to be in Miramar beach on that particular day to witness the magnificent International Kite flying festival held in association with Goa tourism. That was a wonderful scene.. Located close to the main road and on the way to Dona Paula view point this one is a must visit beach in Goa.. .
Memorable place to explore goa. Do try the ice gola at the beach entrance especially the milk made one.
The beach is clean and beautiful. Enjoyed the morning and evening walks. The boat cruise was a bonus with some momentary sightings of dolphins.
"Awesome place to hang out! We went there in september end, it was not really busy and we had fun! You get a to add a very new experience to your life. The waves are soothing and relaxing. You can sit there and enjoy sunset. You can also get your feet massaged. We took our music speaker with us so while watching sunset we enjoyed our music. You can also buy food from local vendors and have a quality time. This places helps you forget all your issues and worries and refreshes you from within. You will fall in love with yourself again. You can go here with your friends or loved ones it is equally enjoyable. Wear comfortable clothes and you will be drenching in water so take a extra pair of clothes with you."
Just a normal beach within the city. Had a lot of muck and did not feel like stepping in. Commercial place and mostly local crowd. Skip if you can.
"A decent well maintained beach in Panjim Goa. Compared to other beaches in North Goa, this is not crowded and neat."
Visited miramar beach as part of a day tour. A very clean and quiet beach on the day we went. Definately recommend a visit as it's a very beautiful beach.
one of the must visit place in goa. enjoyed our visit here & the maintenance is not great but its ok.
"There is a patch of trees giving shade from the heat near the beach. Had fresh coconuts and mango slices with the salty chilli lemon, delicious!"
"nice place to relax. Near to city, so no need to travel long distance to get to a beach. less crowded compared to other beaches in Goa. Parking available easily. Nearby place to visit is 'science park'. A good afternoon can be spent at these 2 locations."
"Situated at the confluence of the Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea, it is a small average beach. Nothing to see here .Just go and walk ,spend 10 to 20 minutes and return.no stalls of foods also.Some hindi movies are shoot here."
"Biked about 25-30 km from the other side of Goa to run, spend time with locals early in the morning and catch the sunrise. All three of these are a rarity in Goa these days, considering how commercial and touristy most beaches have become. Miramar was a refreshing change."
"Wasnt crowded during late afternoon, lots of shells unlike some of the other beaches in Goa. loved the time spent there, cleanliness needs to be worked upon"
"Clean and filled with soft sand, Miramar is quite a destination for evening walks and early morning strolls in Goa. It is  listed amongst the most popular beaches of Goa due to its location. Walk, swim and play on the sand – thats something the locals as well as the tourists like to do at Miramar. Explore eating Goan food and cuisine in the local well-maintained eateries."
Visited on a Sunday afternoon very crowded and lots of litter. Experience not helped by bus horns nearby.A couple of good food outlets on main road.Other beaches are better quality.
The beach as such does not boast of anything exotic compared to other beaches in Goa. The so-called pine trees near the beach is just a patch. Wasn't clean either
Beach was nice with lot of eating options available. You can enjoy at the fullest with family. Recommended to visit.
Visited Miramar beach with parents for a short walk in the morning.  Not much sand except at the main entrance side of the beach though. As compared to evenings the morning seemed less crowded with only people being the ones doing their morning walk or playing along the beach.
"Its good beach, we went to Dolphin view from here. Saw some tails of Dolphin and nice trip overall, if you are not going with sole purpose of watching Dolphin. I think no one will visit Goa for this beach."
"I went to Miramar Beach. Miramar Beach is listed amongst the most popular beaches of Goa due to its location. Located in the Capital of Goa; it is very easily accessible by the tourists as well as the locals. This beach is also a hot spot to celebrate local festivals. Clean, filled with soft sand; it is quite a destination for evening walks and early morning strolls. It is great place to go."
"Lovely beach, scenic view, avoid swimming here, take nice long walks. Get your camera ready to click the sunset view"
Serene beach. Enjoy the cool wind while sitting on the benches near the beach. Not so much of crowd. Other beaches have to offer more than Miramar.
