"The pandas are the most cute creatures ever. They are very well taken care, their pavillion offers everythig they need and it is very visible to the tourists.However, the place itself does not have even a single cab to ride back to the city (is quite far). And most impressive of all: itheir souvenir store does not sell a single stuffed panda for kids. Isn't that ridiculous?"
"A clean park with other animals, birds and plants too. The pandas are very adorable with cute actions. Spent some time admiring them."
"Do not hesitate. Go to the Panda Pavilion. The pandas are up close, cute and adorable! The best time to go is during feeding time at 2:00 (14:00). To see them chomping on the stalks of bamboo is a memory you will surely cherish for a long time.  Donâ€™t miss it."
"The entire place is so very well taken care of, perfect place for kids and adults alike. The entrance fee is only MOP10 for adults, senior citizens can get in for free! There is also a butterfly park but it was closed for renovation when I was there. There are other animals there to see and beautiful landscaping all around the park. I'd love to walk and explore more of the park but because I'm with my parents I didn't. The panda enclosure is open for visitors on a 1 hour slot each. So it sometimes depends on luck if the pandas will choose to wanna come out for food/ to play. We were lucky that one of them came out and she was happily eating bamboo shoots for the entire 1 hour :) the next slot wouldn't be so lucky as she was asleep unless her partner or babies decide to come out? I'm not too sure of how it works but it's definitely worth a visit although this place is a little bit far out. Hailing a cab from the panda park is difficult, so be warned. Taking the public bus is the most convenient thing to do as the bus stop is right outside (on both sides of the road). We left and took the public bus to the ferry terminal and from there we take the free hotel shuttle to get to our next destination."
macau giant panda pavillion is a great place. my kids really enjoyed seeing how the pandas were nurtered here. enjoyed a lot.
"Great little 'zoo' and we had a truly wonderful experience with two giant pandas eating no more than 3m away from us!! The zoo is free, with a 10mop entry fee for a one hour slot of the panda pavilion (more than enough time). Following tripadvisor advice (thank you!) we timed our slot for 4pm and it couldn't have been better - the pandas were eating for the full hour and we had an awesome view. Cheapest and best experience of our time in Macau. Extra tip: the bus stop is right outside: SO easy to get here - whole experience for less than 16mop per person!"
"we just made it in time to view the giant pandas - they shut fm 1 - 2 pm! The pandas were v v cute. so were the red pandas. other animals average. i guess its really a place for kids. BEWARE - transport back, even to the close by cotai strip malls is very tough! so may be a good idea to book a return taxi"
"Living across the road from the panda park is a great getaway from apartment living or the bright lights if Cotai.The enclosure is air conditioned and has various animals, birds and kids playgrounds to see outside of the zone panda,Kai Kai.The downside is there is only 1 panda and he sleeps a lot!!! Panda aren't known for there active lifestyle- great photos when he is awake/ eating/ walking around."
The view of pandas steak your heart. A good place to visit for setting pandas. Make sure you don't miss the bus stop if arriving by a bus.
"Got to agree with everyone about the state of the pavilion; you can tell that the pandas are well loved and great pride is taken in keeping them safe, happy, and healthy. The other animals, however, not so much. The cages for the birds are rather small and I am sure that they don't get to fly around as much as they would like.As the title suggests this isn't the easiest place to get away from. Getting there is no hassle, but getting back does require planning. Make sure you know which bus to get and from which side as it can be a time consuming mistake to get the wrong one. If you are planning on taking a taxi back; also think again. There is no taxi rank nearby and the road that pavilion is on is small and there is relatively little traffic so flagging down can be arduous.in a nutshell, you have to to see the pandas, but you have to have an exit in mind when you are finished seeing them."
"Set south of the main hotel ""Strip"" on Macau this park has a large pavilion where you can see Pandas in a large enclosure through thick clear glass. When we arrived a Panda was pacing backwards and forwards as if very unhappy at its confinement. But the real reason, it was hungry. It was 4 pm and time to eat. The Panda retreated to its room, the door closed. Another door opened and keepers can out with bundles of bamboo branches and placed down near the spectator window. They retreated and the Panda door was open and it ambled down to eat the bamboo. What a sight! The speed at which it devoured the bamboo leaves was awesome. The park is worth a visit anyway but especially if you can time it to see the Pandas feed. At this wasn't all. In a separate smaller pavilion there were a number of red pandas on show too. So... twice as much to see for your money."
"Very nice set up with over 5 pandas, both children and adult can visit and enjoy.  Be prepared to take photos and you can even buy souvenirs"
"If you are a Panda lover then you must go here. Scratch that if you want smile at looking at something ridiculously cute go there. In Hong Kong you could spend HKD 150 to visit the Ocean park, or spend HKD 10 here and see the Pandas up close. If you are tired of the casinos (or have had a bad run) then come here to recharge your batteries. You will not regret it! Unfortunately they had only 1 Panda when I went. His sister apparently died only 2 weeks before I visited due to some illness. So he did look kinda lonely and sad."
Happen to see them having their meal. A nice opportunity. There are a total of 4 pandas in this pavilion. Two of them are the twin male offspring of the original 2 pandas given by China. Currently the parents are kept in separation as they fight each other for territory. While their offspring play with each other.
I guess the pandas were taking a nap somewhere as we didn't see any. The place is also kind of hard to reach and there's no public transportation. See pandas in Ocean Park instead...
"Sole purpose if the attraction is seeing the panda. The tickets are sold with seperate sessions thus for every session, bamboo will be placed out for the panda to come out to munch and after finishing the panda just went back to sleep/rest. After repeating so many sessions and and for so long, the panda kind of got bored and doesn't bother who's watching them. Living a routine life behind the glass seems cruel, especially now when only one left. The place is really middle of nowhere, so you either take taxi or learn to ride public bus, in my case we took the scenic route and went around the housing estates and neighbourhood on bus, but the good side is, it's close (on the way) to Lord Stow's restaurant, for those hunting for the famous tart, the originator."
"We went here when it was still hot, hot hot! So nice to be in the air con pavilion. Anyway, the pandas, were great to see - there are also lots of other wild life around the park, birds and monkeys and lots to see. Very affordable. A taxi here costs us around $70 from the venetian. Then we got the public bus back to central where we could catch the ferry. Wow - it was a good place to get on the bus but as it travels through town it gets absolutely packed! Make sure you get a seat at the back - tricky to get off! I would eat before visiting the pandas - not great food! BE sure to check out the dates, they close for a little around 1pmish."
"Went Macau for a day trip on 21/1/16, not planned but suddenly wanna see pandas!We arrived there around 2:30pm, not very busy. There are 2 parts of panda pavilion, indoor and outdoor. KaiKai was happily eating the bamboo in indoor part! We r lucky that he suddenly walked down near us so we can have a close up look at it! So adorable! Really don't want to leave the place!The last pic is a statue panda with the landmark temple in Macau, funny!"
For 10mop you get to seat and relax inside a airconditioned dome where you get to see pandas. Big place to go around the park. There is a kiosk to have snacks and drinks. Fare is flat 6mop. Bring exact amount as the bus drivee doesn't give change.
"We visited the panda pavilion Macau in May 2018 with our children. It is wonderful and our kids enjoyed to the core. Why kids, even parents go mad and it will take us to our teen age. It has pair of panda bear with two cubs. Cubs are very playful. father panda did some majestic walk and tricks. You can see very rare animals and birds there. You may also like the souvenir shop. You may get panda printed t shirts at discounted rate. please do not miss out it is worth seeing. Bus is the best and cheap option for Macau. At the end, you will come out with a feeling to visit the place again. please download local mobile app for bus routes and timings and local sight seeing places. Enjoyed it."
Needs a variety of wildlife. Is interesting to see the 2 pandas. They were up and about and we saw them having their lunch there after started playing
Am so glad we were able to visit the Giant Panda Pavilion.  We go there at about 10:30 which was perfect as the teen Pandas were out and eating and were picture perfect.  Mama Panda was also out and about and Papa Panda was napping but very visible.  Loved that they shared their story and background.  And they also had the Red Pandas which not clear why they're called that as they look more like racoons but they were so adorable.  They also had different primates and birds.  If we had more time I would've loved to spend more time there but it's a definitely destination to visit if you're a panda lover like we are!
"Saw two baby pandas and one adult panda.  The baby pandas are behind glass, but the adult panda can be photographed without anything between you and the panda. Really cool experience."
"travel away from the casinos so that your kids also feel part of the vacation. could well spend over 2 hours, activities available for kids to be engaged"
"You only need to pay 10 MOP if you want to see the pandas. You need to buy your ticket for a particular time frame (you can go anytime in that hour). There are two pandas, chances are they will be sitting and eating. Kids under 12? are free, seniors over 65 are free."
"When in Macau with the family, take them to the Giant Pandas. Go early (10a) as they tend to sleep in the afternoon. Super cute and very cheap."
"Some friends and I ventured outside of our resort style hotel to act like a local and to see the sites of the city. We hopped in a taxi and pointed to the pandas on a map. The price for the taxi ride from the Okura was not bad; ask your concierge for more information. BUT there's a catch. The taxi doesn't drop you off at the pandas. The taxi takes you halfway up the hill to A-Ma Temple, drives in 3 circles in the parking lot, THEN lets you out. Did I mention that if he let you out at the bottom of the hill there is a shuttle to take you up the hill? I digress... Pandas. After coming down the hill the pandas are to your right, down the street. The admission price is reasonable. You are able to visit the panda pavilion with one panda, the aviary with two emu, and the education center. There are parks and statues all over which were great to see. We visited mid morning and got to see the panda doing what he does best: sleeping. Wondering why I gave it 4 stars seeing as most countries have more pandas in their zoos and emu on their ranches? I loved seeing the kids visiting. They were the best behaved kids, all standing in a row, marveling at one giant sleeping teddy bear. They were intrigued by the panda facts at the education center. They walked in a perfect little row. The were told to smile for a picture and all at once there were 24 perfect smiles - and 48 peace signs on their fingers. You see, the panda was good. The kids were fantastic. I came to see local life and that's exactly what I got.The pavilion is across the street from a bus stop. If you want to go north again towards Taipa, you'll need to cross the street and wait at that bus stop. Plant to have accurate change for the bus fare. Ask the gift shop attendant for more info. Expect to spend between 30 minutes to 2+ hours here."
"I lived in China for several years and have seen pandas in 4 countries, but the set up here is about the best I've experienced.  A ticket (MOP10, ridiculously cheap!) allows access to the giant pandas' pavilion for an hour.  Each session begins on the hour.  The enclosures (2) are huge and the care for the pandas is obvious.  Pandas are just a joy to watch.  The pavilion has both adults and young-ish pandas (two 2-year-olds).The red pandas (3 or 4? absolutely adorable and often more active than giant pandas) are housed in a separate, smaller building.  They, along with several monkeys, lemurs, and a few birds (plus a good-sized flamingo colony), are free to visit (only visits to the panda cost). There's a panda information centre which is free, informative, and interesting.  And the gift shop has many panda-themed products at very reasonable prices.  Most are kitschy, but that can have its own appeal. The park is quite compact, but there are also some shaded benches to get out of the worst of the heat.For those staying in Cotai, nothing could be easier than getting to Seac Pai Van Park. At least 4 local buses (21, 22?, 25, 26) go there for a flat cost of MOP6.  From right in front of City of Dreams, the ride was only about 15 min."
"Everyone should know panda is national animal protection. Panda is very precious so we must cherish and love more the animals. Firstly, Macao has less zoo, China give two pandas in Macau, therefore, we must treasure the panda well. So the government was building the place for panda to living. And put this joy thing to every people to watch, I was go there one time with family in our free time, before visit the panda pavilion, I had gone the mainland china such as some zoo to watch many variety animals and one of the panda. I think that the pandas were so cute and relaxing. They do not need to do everything; the breeder will give them some bamboo on time. I think that place suitable for family number to visit, but because of the remote location, and there is no shuttle bus, do not benefit for tourists visiting; In addition, the animal park is too small, relative to the number of animals in Hong Kong and the mainland zoo is really less and have less but park environment quite beautiful. Remember last time when I visited pandas, obviously have two pandas, but I only see one and the one just only sleep and eat."
"This is a giant panda pavilion which is inside a public tracking park. In the park, there's also a research center of panda, but overall, it's not a zoo with lots of other animals. If you're expecting that, it might just disappoint you. The park is located in the south of Taipa, where is easy to get access by local bus. Entering the park is free, but you will need MOP10 for adult at 13~64 yrs. Children under 12 and senior visitors over 65 is free for entree. The pavilion is regularly off on Mondays, and break on 13:00~14:00. 6 visiting schedules per day, each visit is up to 1 hour. It's a great place to pay a visit, even though just watching panda eating, and you may be able to watch that for 30 min. That's how adorable they are. One thing you need to be aware. The staffs are restrictly following a order: Be quiet. They might just ""shh"" you if you talk a bit louder. Don't be surprise and feel insulted, they just do their best to keep pandas under great place of living and not to be scared by people. BTW, the viewing stage is basically connecting to panda's land."
"A beautiful park with very cheap entry - around $2AU pp. Only 3 pandas were there, but they were so cute! The rest of the park had flamingos, red pandas, and so many other animals. A definite must for anyone going to Macau. TIP: get a taxi there. Don't try and walk it! We tried to walk back to the Venetian from here (a mere 3km away), and it is not pedestrian-friendly."
"Loved it!!! The grounds are beautiful.  It is a great place to go and relax.  It has beautiful gardens, some monkeys and flamingos.  The panda exhibit was really nice.  You are able to view the pandas in a natural habitat.  I could of stayed all day and just watched the panda.  Only one was in the viewing area when we visited."
"The panda pavilion is part of a larger area with several activities and attractions. Besides pandas there are monkeys and other small and medium sized exotic animals. The general area is free of charge, for the pandas an entry fee is charged. visiting this mini zoo is a nice thing to do for families and kids. It is easy to get there, many public buses stop right in front. Also a good stopever when heading to visit Coloane village."
"Be sure to visit at feeding time - 11 AM or 2 PM I believe - and you can see the pandas when they are active. If you're in this part of Macau definitely make a stop here and to the nearby Matsu Cultural Village, a 5 minute walk from the panda park."
"Decided to make a trip to see Pandas as read a lot about it and my 7 year old was very keen.  This place is in the middle of a residential area so it is difficult to get there and back.  Here's hope we did it.  There was seven adults and one child.  We took the free bus to City of Dreams from the Macau Ferry Terminal.  Then we walked to the South Entrance of the mall (where the free bus drops you off, enter the mall and turn left.  Keep walking past all the cosmetics counters).  Head outside the entrance and turn right.  You should see a bus stop by the side of the road. Take 26A (or 21A) and it should stop you right outside the enclosure. Estr de Seac Pai Van is the road outside.  After the panda session, we took the same 26A from opposite the road and that took us all the way to St Paul's.  Each trip cost $6mop or hkd, they don't give change on buses so make sure you have sufficient coins.The enclosure was great.  Not many people and the pandas were right up close. We were there at 2pmand they were feeding and active so it was awesome.  Now if you are a massive animal lover and think animals should be out in the wild or have a lot of room, this might not be the place for you.   The enclosure is split into two for three pandas and each half is probably about 25m x 40m."
