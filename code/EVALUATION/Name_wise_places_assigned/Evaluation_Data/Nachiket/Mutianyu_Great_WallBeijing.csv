"Do not go to Beijing without visiting The Great Wall! We were slightly anxious about visiting in December but whilst there was snow on the ground the sky was beautifully clear! Layered clothing defiantly the answer. We took two public busses to get there because we missed the shuttle bus which leaves daily AT 8am not FROM 8am as the information we’d seen had suggested. If you’d going to take a public bus, have the destination written down in Chinese! We walked half an hour up to the wall, about two hours along it and then about 20 minutes back down. There’s a cable car and toboggan option down but I’m not sure it’s worth it, we got down faster walking!If you can keep walking along the top after the crowds have petered out, it’s steep but I promise it is totally worth it! Take a snack and if it’s winter, a flask of something warm! Enjoy it! You’ll remember it forever!"
An enjoyable day out and close to central Beijing - could have done with better signage to explain what we were looking at and a lot of it felt over restored. Tobogganing was fun
"I was only in China for a few months, but still the day I spent going to the wall was a waste. If you'e seen a picture you're good. Just skip this and have an extra day doing something interesting. Easily the worst day of my several trips to China. ANYTHING ELSE is better. Washrooms are disgusting too."
"Visiting This section of The Great Wall is an amazing experience. One word of caution. Even though there is a gondola to take you to the base of the wall, from where the shuttle drops you off, the road to the gondola requires a walk up a steep incline and is very difficult for someone with limited mobility. There was someone with a motorized cart that will transport people up to the gondola for a fee, but he is an independent business and we did not see any other means of assistance. We had two members in our party with limited mobility and assumed that the gondola would address their needs. The whole process took longer than expected, but once we made it to the wall, the experience was well worth it."
"We did the Great Wall with friends during a long layover in Beijing from U SUnbeknownst to me ( I didn’t do my research  so I didn’t fully know what was involved in touring it )I didn’t know you had to cable car up there ..I am afraid of heights . Very afraid!So now I had a problem either go back sit in the  airport for an over 20 hr layover Making everyone else in the group miserable ..hygyyyyOr muster up some courage go up there and see one of the wonders of the world !Well I opted for the latter . It wasn’t easy getting up there ..that’s another review of its own .. but I got up there climbed a few sections ..the steps aren’t even so it’s not easy but the good part is once you start climbing steps you can climb as high as you like or as low as you want or don’t climb at all.. you can just sit under the garrett and just take in the views  of the Wall from a distance .. there’s enough wall for all to see .. I’m told it spans some 26,000 miles ..The experience is grand We had perfect weather end of October I would not recommend it when it’s hot because uou expend a lot of energy ..if u do go stay hydrated ..We decided to toboggan down rather than take the terrorizing ride down with the cable car ..at least for me and my“ height fear “ it WAS terrorizing !The toboggan was a lot less intimidating even fun at times ..I felt better because w the lever you can stop it thereby keeping ME in control ..Well I got down it was exhilarating ..So Do Ii Recommend the Great Wall ?   By all means  if you have time and the means .. ( not afraid if heights that is)just make sure you fo your research and hav full understanding as to what it involves .... Enjoy .. take lots of water and snacks !"
"Visiting the Great Wall At Mutianyu, Beijing has been on my list, I am so happy to tick off this attraction now. The great wall of china is surely massive and revered. It is over 6,000 kilometres long and extends over breath-taking scenery. It was cloudy on our day visit; this added a mysterious element to the whole experience. We reached the top via cable car ” or “teleferic. It is a UNESCO listed attraction and definitely worth visiting.  SEE photos."
"Unfortunately it rained when we visited the Great Wall. The cable car ride through the mist and clouds was marvelous. Walking and climbing the slippery steps to the wall was not so much fun. The photo provided for this review shows a blue sky which is a myth anyway given the pollution around Beijing. The locals call a blue sky Olympic Blue, meaning that clear skies are produced by the government for the tourists who attended the Olympics and not for the residents who live in Beijing. The wall of course is impressive and surprisingly wide. However, in winter it must have been a miserable place to have guard duty."
"Stayed in central Beijing but wanted to visit a section of the wall which wasn't as touristy as badaling ( closest section to Beijing) . We booked a private driver and visited the Longqingxia gorge in the morning and went to the wall in the afternoon . It took around 1.45 to get to the this section of the wall . The best part was there wasn't many tourists which meant you could walk the wall leisurely without being rushed and also take photos without getting random people in them .There are two tickets you can buy . Go up and down in a cable car or go up on a ski lift and come down via the tabogon. We chose the latter option. Both are same price . The price for the ski lift ,entrance to walk the wall and to come back down was about £18! Bargain . Ski lift up was very scary but safe .You arrive at the wall at entry point 6. We walked from point 6 to 1 as recommenced by the driver . This section has the best views and is more difficult as it's steep . I think this part isn't as re-made as some other parts of the wall . The walk took bout hour but OMG , the views were breath taking . Absolutely amazing . We walked back to point 6 and took the tabogon down which was another experience !! You can slow if you like or faster - there's a hand break . It's worth visiting this section of the wall for the quite and calm and views . The best day by far on my travels"
"We hired a taxi for the day in Beijing. We did this to beat the touringcars and that worked. We got in the taxi at 6AM (yes very early) and arrived at the gates just before they opened. Because of this we were at the wall with very few others. This gave us the opportunity to get the pictures we wanted. We were with a party of 4. 3 of us took the cablecars and 1 of us walked up. The walk was do-able, but not really interesting. The views up on the wall were great. Be sure to wear good footwear, cause it can be very steep and take some water with you, cause it get hot quickly."
"This is one of the must-go Great Wall. According to our guide, Clare, she said Mutianyu has lesser crowd than Badaling. We took the cable car to Tower 14 and strolled to Tower 20. Weather though was 17 degree but was sunny. Too Hot to take photo. We were there about 9am ++.I could only advise for those walking from Tower 14 to 20. Need to have good legs. Lots of stairs, and some were uneven. Careful when going from Tower 19 to 20, I stopped few times to catch my breath. Tower 20 stairs were really steep. Chop chop take photo and walked back to Tower 14. Coming down was easy for me. And to take cable car back, we queued rounds 15 minutes, and no one cut queue. We booked the trip through Klook."
Well worth the extra drive out of Beijing to see this.  Enjoyed the cable car up and the exercise walking along the wall I'm sure did us both good :o)
Enjoyed our day to the Great Wall! Very seamless transport with Mubus and our tour guide Michael was wonderful and helpful
This was the culmination of a lifelong dream to walk on the Great Wall. Mutianyu is a lesser traveled entry way and it comes with a cable car to make the climb to the top and a thrilling luge ride to descend off the wall if you are so inclined. There is a small tourist oriented village at the base filled with trinkets and food. The wall was been reconstructed to its former glory and you can walk for miles but it rapidly becomes strenuous as the wall follows the contour of the mountain top. Do not miss the chance to see the Wall!
"Our tour of 9 people had a guide who spoke very good English and we spent about 3 hours at the wall area.  Climbing the stairways to reach the wall may be very challenging for many, as well as actually walking on the wall may be too taxing for most.  I didn’t have any issues and was able to walk about 30 minutes up the wall, so with with the return walk it was an hour trek,  Many steps are 16  to 18 inches high, with others shorter.  Regardless, however you experience the wall, it will be a once in a lifetime experience and you surely should do it."
"Mutiyanyu is a crowded and tourist-ridden section of the Great Wall. But its views are fantastic, and the wall is well renvoated. Several stones are over 2000 years old and weigh hundreds of tons. You can go up in 3 ways - climb 1300 steps (with 2 paths, each reaching a different guard house), cable car and gondola (ski/chair lift). Would recommend climbing up as the forested steps are a fantastic experience - can be done by first time/not-so-fit trekkers (like me) although you may need several breaks (also like me). While coming down, we chose the chair lift although the toboggan ride is a popular and fun option. Get here first thing in the morning to avoid crowds. August is especially very crowded because it is vacation month in China.A beautiful and accessible slice of Chinese and world history. A must see."
We were able to visit the Mutianyu while in Beijing. It was an awesome experience and you can feel the history when walking along the wall. Going with Odynovo made it really easy.
"Such an amazing experience. It takes some time to get from centre of Beijing to this section of the wall but it was worth it. Took a chair lift up, then walked quite a way, and lots of steps, but not too hard.  Views spectacular. We had an amazing trip down via the toboggan type speed chute, which saved a bit of time, but was lots of fun."
"The first visions of the Mutianyu Wall will just take your breath- it is an incredible site from any angle, so have your camera ready.  Walking through the stone towers and along the stone paths will have you marvelling at the skill of the Wall's construction and at the intensity of the labor involved.  Mutianyu is the location of the highest section of the Great Wall, so visitors  are offered options to hiking such as cable car rides, toboggan rides, or chair lift rides to reach the top or bottom."
Took the chair lift up and the luge down - worth it!  The Great Wall is an amazing experience!  The beauty of the Wall and the surrounding area takes your breath away!  Loved every minute of our time here!
"Visit during a layover from Thailand. Happened to meet a very helpful driver in the Beijing airport. About an hour and a half ride. Because of our personal driver, the ticket process and everything about our visit was simple and easy.  He even waited for us in the tourist area and recommended a nice restaurant after our visit to the wall. The crowd made it less of an experience for us. It was severely touristy. However to be able to visit the Great Wall of China even under those circumstances is in itself and honor. Although I wouldn’t recommend it because of the lack of a sidewalk, we even missed the shuttle back down the mountain on purpose and walked back to the shuttle hub after our great wall visit, through the small town. Amazing experience."
"We visited the Great Wall of China, Mutianyu section in December 12, 2019. We are a family of nine (9), eight adults and one kid. It was -7 C when we left Beijing downtown area at 7am. The weather was between -2C to -4C when we reached Mutianyu by 9am. We booked our MUTIANYU Great Wall adventure with Bus Tour on Klook. We got it on discount. Good for 2 People per set (we bought 5 sets for 10pax at P1,100 if I can still remember. No cable car ride included. We bought it separately from the Tour Guide at RMB 120, prices depends on the season).We Book Great Wall of China Tour on Klook. Pickup Time is 7am. They will tell you where the nearest pickup point. Make sure to arrive on time. Bring water and snacks. Travel Time from Downtown Beijing to Mutianyu is two hours.After the tour, we had lunch in a Chinese Restaurant called Chun Ju Farm House. They served sumptuous and in huge serving. It was worth the money.Although, there were only five of us who took the cable car and went all the way to the Great Wall Section overall, we had a great time in Beijing."
we booked a day tour w lunch w Klook and the local tour is handled by Mu bus.  Our English speak tour guide Leo Liu recommended 2 ways cable car up to Station 14 and walk 1.5hrs-2hrs to Station 20.  The scenary is the best between Station 19 to 20 but was also the most difficult walk w steep steps.  We walked back to Station 14 and took the cable car down.  Bring sufficient water and snacks so that u could stop on the wall.  Visit the toilet at the base of the station before u catch the cable car.
"We went to the Wall a few days ago. Breathtakingly BEAUTIFUL views. The cable car up and down was another highlight, scary though  exhilarating. We were blessed with fantastic weather, freezing but clear and sunny. This section of the Wall is not crowded at all, just a totally acceptable amount of fellow tourists so didn't feel cramped at any point. The surrounding scenery is remarkable. It's very peaceful, with the exception of the helicopter tour every 20 minutes. Which you can do for 750yuan I think it was.The Wall is a once in a lifetime experience.Perfect opportunity to take those bucket list photos. Beware of the merchant ladies just after the entrance, they will entice you with fake silk,   t-shirts, paintings, and the likes. If you're hard up for souvenirs and belated Christmas gifts for your mother like I was, it's easy to get acceptable prices. They will start with the astronomical figure just to warn you. fake silk garments for 280yuan oh my golly! So if you enjoy a good HAGGLE, it's easily done with this lot. PS. Gatorades are NOT 25yuan! can be haggled to an acceptable and fair 10yuan per bottle, after a tiring Wall hike."
This is a wall and it is a very long wall. Seems like it will keep people in or out. I don't know why it has to be 100 characters. I've said enough.
"We went to the Great Wall at Mutianyu in Jan, with some snow all around. Two companies operate cable cars in this place, separated by a considerable section of the wall. If you do not mind buying separate tickets instead of a round trip ticket, it is preferable to go up in one cable car, walk the length of the wall to the other companies operation, and take the other cable car (or a tobaggon) down. We were a bit worried about the sub-zero temperature, but with the bright sunshine and the walking, we actually felt quite warm. Do reserve some time for the Mutiyanyu village. It is beautiful and has several restaurants, including a Burger King. Do not plan to get on the wall if you are weak or have a heart condition, since there are many steps to climb up and down all the time."
What other superlatives can be used when reviewing this place. Was not prepared for the scale of it! We visited on a clear sunny cold windy day. It was tremendously busy but we had so much fun. Got the funicular railway up and then you had to walk. This is not something to contemplate if you have mobility issues - however it is wonderful - steep climbs lots of steps and spectacular views. What a feat of human endeavour was this. Highly recommend but if the weather is bad would think this would be challenging.
Booked a private car trip through tripadvisor. We took the cable car up and down. Also walked for quite a while on the wall. It was a lot of fun.
"You visit China, not visit Greatwall will be a big mistake. So pls do visit there, and again get your ticket online from “Get Your Guide” or “Klook” or from a local website to safe your time, and the tour leader will do the rest for you. Get a nice camera to take a great photo there, don’t forget."
"well kept section of the Great Wall, apparently less busy than other sections close to Beijing. Going up by skilift was pictoresque, going down by tobbago was more convenient than I expected"
"had a truly great day on the Mutianyu part of the Great Chinese Wall. Leaving from Beijing at 7 AM in the start of December in light frost end sun, I really enjoyed the 90 minutes ride. If your driver speaks English, I can only recommend that you interview him/her about the infrastructure under construction etc. you pass on the way to Mutianyu. If you come in Winter, don’t forget to bring warm clothes. As I arrived, there was some centimeters of snow on the North Sides and in the shade. Ski lifts are offered to reach the wall, but I strongly recommend,  that you consider to walk the 200 meters of altitude since this will – so to speak – prepare your mind much better. The track is well marked and in very fine condition. On the top of the wall, you must try to imagine the mongols approaching on horses from North. Read some history in advance. Along the wall, you will find more cafeterias. Prices for a coffee are not cheap, but what a place to enjoy it. Such a Winter day, we had approximately 100 km sight. Magnificent!"
"This portion of the wall was relatively easy to get to (joined a small group tour by Trippest)  and not too bad to get to the wall itself. There is a short uphill climb to get to the cable car, which I used. Going to the top on foot didn't look as hard as I expected, but time is also a consideration. Once at the top you have the choice of continuing up or down the wall, but there are also up and down areas including steps all along each segment between towers. The views were amazing all along this portion. If you can make it up to the cable car, you can enjoy large portions of this wall no matter what your physical limitations are. The active people, in the tour group I was with, made it to the top tower allowable, and back, in less time than we were given, the rest did what they could or wanted to do. It really didn't matter as the views were great from the very first tower. Loved this location!"
"Mutianyu Great Wall      BeijingA terrific way to get to the best part of the Great Wall from the airport is by local, public bus (not tour bus/private car/organised tour) Take the airport express from the airport to Dongzhimen station. It is about half an hour; the ticket price is 25RMB. Take 916 express (make sure it's the EXPRESS) - go to Huairoubeidajie station, transfer H23 or quick cab ride to Mutianyu. Or get the bus all the way up, & head to tower 14, then just keep climbing. You can go all the way to the top. It's hard, but soooooo worthwhile. There's not much food, and it's quite arduous, so take food with you or you can get to bargain for water, fruit and snacks on the way up, if you forget. I even had large portions of the wall all to myself, sometimes for several minutes. And there are drink sellers right near the top - hardy souls, I think they deserve patronage.Such an achievement to climb so high, you feel like you are on top of the world.If you have time to visit Shanghai, aside from my favourite restaurant - Mr and Mrs Bund - there are two other hard-to-find places you should visit - the well-hidden propaganda poster museum and the Former Provisional Government Site of the Republic of Korea (a bit like a poor man's Churchill War Cabinet rooms in London)"
"One of the great wonders of the world, this is a must to when in Beijing. We went up Mutianyu via cable car and down by the toboggan. It was simply amazing up there with the scenery and vastness of the wall. Remember to be in comfortable footwear and dress appropriately. We went up in winter and even though I was wearing four layers, I still felt chilly so be sure to be snuggly before you do the climb. Steps and more steps, prepare to do lots of walking and climbing. Other than that, don't forget to bring along your camera to record memories of the journey!"
"If you can only get one visit to the Great Wall, Mutianyu is a good choice. Not too far from Beijing. Crowded but not as crowded as closer sections. Beautifully restored and a great bit of scenery. Visited in Autumn and the colours were lovely. Access easy via a cable car. You can stroll a neat section, see guard towers and climb some steep steps. Some great positions for photos. I believe this section was favoured by Chairman Mao, so what more endorsement could you have?"
Visited this section of the Great Wall after lunch and there was not much crowd which suited us well as we got to take many great shots.  Views were breathtaking and the wall itself was a magnificent sight.  A must visit when in Beijing.
