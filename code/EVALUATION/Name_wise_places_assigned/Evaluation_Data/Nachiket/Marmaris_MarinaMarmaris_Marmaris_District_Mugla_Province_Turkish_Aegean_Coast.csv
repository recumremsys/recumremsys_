What a lovely marina to walk around and people watch or boat watch! Great selection of restaurants and shops too. Keep an eye out for fish in the crystal clear water and the playful kitties.
This is a very lovely marina was surprised by how big it was and very busy. Loads of lovely restaurants and bars in the area just off the grand bazaar.  Made a great evenings entertainment.
Have developed the marina area into a great place. Lots of eateries and bars. Plenty of boats to have a boat trip (it's a must do).
Water taxi from our resort took us to this marina which was very pretty. Ate and drank at few of the bars during daytime which was good.
"I love the city and its splendid views. Marina is beautiful . Recommend it to everyone. There are good restaurants , too"
Buzzing atmosphere lots going on. Bazaar market right next to the harbour with lots of shops. Buses running regularly and cost 50p each Approx kids free. Lots of restaurants. ATMs. Places to exchange money. Can get hassled a bit to come and have a look but that’s nothing.
Found the marina after being told about the dancing fountain show which we headed down to see one evening.  Lovely area with some gorgeous boats. We returned during the day for a drink by the sea and it was lovely and peaceful.
"What fantastic place Mamaris is. When you first arrive it looks more like Hawaii with all the palm trees, and all those boats in marina look fantastic with endless row of restaurants facing the marina. Really wonderful.  Great restaurants,  great shopping, great fun atmosphere. Beach holiday resort feel to the whole place. Do one of the pirate boat trips. You will enjoy them. Will come back here again."
"Fabulous place with great bargains to be had, just be careful otherwise you could pay more than you really need to!!  Don't always be turned by the ""copy designer products"" as some of them are much better than others.  If you can get someone to recommend that is the best bet.  When shopping, always drink if you are offered it, otherwise it can be seen as insulting...if you really don't want to buy something, just tell them it is the end of your holiday and you haven't any money left as you spent it the last time you visited.  Above all, be polite and just say no thank you.  This is what I did when I was there and I had no trouble at all.  Have a great time!"
Great restaurants and selection of boats to drull over. Try it out and see what I mean. Close to the Bazzer for hassle free shopping
Marina of marmaris is a great place to enjoy a meal or a drink particularly at night . The atmosphere is great with lots of music and controlled by policemen till late night. Enjoy!
"Lovely marina, many beautiful massive yachts. Don't go before 10am unless you like the smell of fish lol but it's a marina so I can't fault them on that!"
The marina is lovely lots of bars and restaurants. Very clean. Lots of water fountain features with statues. Looks beautiful at night
Loved it down here and wish we had booked  to stay on beach front. All though busy and people always trying to get you in the restaurants its lovlie down here
Avoid the shops they all hassle you as you walk past. The best shops were the ones owned by women. They left you to wonder around.
"Not been to Marmaris in 10 years. It’s now much more upmarket than before with lots of £1m boats parked up. Plenty of bars and restaurants available but you do have to run the gauntlet of touts. Felt very safe, worth a visit"
"Loved looking at all the boats and posh yachts, booked our boat trip from here. Bit of hassle with restaurant owners trying to entice you in .much improved over the years. A must visit."
"A long walk here is what the soul needs. Take your time, enjoy the sunset and rising moon and visit a local restaurant. Pricier than the rest but often really good"
The best time to go in my opinion is early evening when the sun is going down and it’s a bit cooler. Looking out to sea in the distance are the mountains which is stunning. Lots of nice restaurants and bars to eat at and have a few drinks.
Marmaris marina is a place to walk eat and drink day or night. Night time prettier as all boats lite up. Excellent view with stunning scenery and a lovely walk. Visit the castle it’s about £3 to get in the views are amazing from up top.
"Nice views of the Marina.  Clean shops with no hassle, no haggle shopping for genuine labels (?).Gentle, calm area. Recommend the Roberts Coffee there."
Went a walk and be nite up the beach path until we reached the marina. Was nice at nite seeing all the boats with there lights on
"Visited during the evening when the weather was a bit more manageable. Great area, plenty of bars and restaurants lined along the front. Prices not extortionate either!"
"Get out of the water before 10am mayhem begins. The coasts of Marmaris including the Marina is amazing to venture about by paddle board. Brought my inflatable board during my stay and learnt the hard way on day 1. All boat tours, jetskis, parasailing and watersport shananigans begin at 10am. Sunrises is at 7am so pace yourself to visit the Marina and it's amazing vicinity.Need any additional detail? Get in touch via IG @sup.mission"
"Be it the yacht marina or the town quay of the old town, this is the best part of Marmaris. Spoilt for choice with restaurants all offering good food at great prices, and a view of yachts and the lovely gulets coming and going from the harbour.  The  restaurants will try and tempt you in by offering the menu for you to read. But they are friendly and polite if you decline."
Been going to the  beautiful marina for years . and it's changed so much over the years it seems to get more beautiful if that's possible.everytime we visit .l love going to see the boats and have taken some of my most memorable days from here .on a Boat/Gulet a lovely married couple an English lady called Caroline from Manchester and her Turkish husband Ozzy have given us some of the best days out on the Boat/Gulet MY LOVE it was called .they had it for years .but we have been going back to find them every time we visit . and unfortunately they've not been there for the past 4 years  .I know they sold the boat but still worked it has the new owner was poorly .at the time.but we also know they was waiting to buy another Boat/Gulet⛵ would love to see them again after spending quite a few years of going out with them .but hopefully we are back in August just a couple of weeks away.and we just might find them while sat having a nice meal at one of the lovely restaurants in the evening .it truly is lovely the marina it becomes truly magical in the evening's . when it' gets busy and all the lights are on you can just have a nice stroll or just sit chatting to the lovely people Turkish or travellers from all parts of the world.im sure who ever spends time strolling or sitting watching the world go by will have lasting memories forever .
"Went for 3 hrs, could have done in 1.5 hrs. Some amazing boats ‘ look up Haida’ in on day sail boats super yachts etc etc. Amazing diamond shop, great bars shish-a bars and covered market for Rhodes looking for original fakes !!!"
relaxed place. i loved the pine apple restaurant. highly recommended. clean and mediterrenean feelings
Visited marina area during week's stay in Marmaris. Plenty of opportunities to take long/short boat trips. Plenty of benches to sit on to watch the world go by. Lots of small individual shops & market hall in the vicinity as well as some great bars & cafes along the Promenade. Worth a visit if in the area.
"We had a family holiday August last year. Went on the Dreamboat twice. Brilliant!! Anyone visiting Marmaris should make it a must. Food and drink is included in the price and the people who run the trip are so welcoming and friendly. You stop for swimming, shopping etc. We had lots of fun. Can't wait to go back."
Went for Coffee here after visiting the castle. Couldn't believe how cheap it was Cappuccino tea and a gluten free brownie £3.
"Been in Marmaris for a few days and the place reminds me of the Benidorm of Turkey.We love Turkey and have been to some amazing places, this is like Blackpool with a lot more Kebab houses and guaranteed sunshine, minus the tower! Shame because it could be really good and if the restaurant touts would leave you alone for more than 5 mins I’d of given it a better review"
"Just returned after a week’s stay in Marmaris with my wife and son. Walking around the marina at anytime is worth it, but I would say at night it is even better, all the restaurants on the waters edge and plenty of boats to look at. The bazaar is just a stones throw away and also shops in the marina."
"Went on my bike down here-though you can't go all the way, which is a shame, though does give much privacy to those on the amazing boats i expect. However, its an amazing spectical. Approaching the Marina, its the usual Pirate, Diving, Tourist Boats ect... Then this turns into hundreds of amazing, off the scale boats. I'm not really a boat person, but i was in awe looking at some of the boats. There is also a section of posh shops in an area on its own, which is nice to walk through. Even though i haven't been there at night, the area leads onto a lot of quirky bars and is very much near the Grand Bazar. Very much worth a look round."
