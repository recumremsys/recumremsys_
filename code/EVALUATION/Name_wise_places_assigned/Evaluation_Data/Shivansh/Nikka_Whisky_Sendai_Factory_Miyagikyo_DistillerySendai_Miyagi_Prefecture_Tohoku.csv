"Had a wonderful time there. Was just in time for the distillery tour． There was some whiskey tasting after the tour, but unfortunately couldn't participate."
"We really enjoyed our visit to the Nikka Distillery.   Getting there was easy.   If you take the train from Sendai, be sure it is fast, direct train.  On the weekends a shuttle bus is waiting to take you to the distillery.  The tours are free and in Japanese.   We followed along in English on our smart phones using the website provided.   At the end of the tour is the tasting, two different whiskers and an apple wine.  Premium whiskey is available for purchase (1/2 shots so you can try a few).    The prices in the shop were reasonable, but we had found bottles of the same whiskey for better prices at a tax free shop in Sendai.   If we were to do this visit again we would try to combine it with a trip to the nearby hot springs."
Went here for a trip to get away from the city hustle and bustle. A very calm and peaceful place. When you get off the train at weekends there is a free shuttle service bus waiting for you that takes you to the door. And back again afterwards. So organised!! You pay for the tour and get an English speaking headset provided. You are taken round various parts of the site and it's all very interesting. They have a tasting session and a gift shop which was also brilliant. Warning - you won't get this at the Tokyo airports when you leave and they are too big for hand luggage - more than 100ml allowance so either buy small ones or put it in your case at high risk of breakage. I can tell you I have bought a bottle of Nikka Whisky in the UK since being back so don't worry about it. Great day out. Great experience.
"I thought I would drop this line to anyone thinking of going to the Nikki factory near Sendai.  I found lots of partial information before we went but nothing as specific as I would have liked.  I use a walking stick so some of the options were not open to me (such as the 2.4 kilometre walk from Sakunami station).So, if you want to get there with less walking, on a weekday (e.g., no shuttle bus) here is what to do From Sendai Station, wait at bus stop number ten and take bus number 840 toward Sakunami Onsen.  At the time of writing, the buses went at half past the hour (e.g, 11:30, 12:30 etc.).  The bus trip is long (about an hour) and not that interesting, so you could take something to read.Once on the bus you can read the screen at the front and keep an eye on station names, the Nikka factory stop does have a name and also an English advice message that this is where you get off for the NIkka factory.  This is all good news because otherwise you look like you are getting off in the middle of nowhere.  However there is a sign toward the NIkka factory, I just didn’t see it until I got off the bus.  Follow that sign down the road and you can’t miss it, although even the walk into the factory is quite long for someone with a minor disability.Once you get the to factory they have a list of all the train departure times from Sakunami (that is presuming you aren’t there on a weekend in which case there is the shuttle bus).  Nothing I read online indicated the availability of taxis in the area, however they ARE available once you get there and the lady at the Nikka desk booked a taxi for us, even timing it to arrive at an appropriate time for the end of the tour plus shopping but in plenty of time to get to Sakanumi train station to catch the train back.So that all worked perfectly for us.  I won’t say more about the factory and tour, others have said it all.  It was a nice day out and even more so as it was cherry blossom season and the place is quite beautiful at that time.  Good luck in your whisky adventures."
