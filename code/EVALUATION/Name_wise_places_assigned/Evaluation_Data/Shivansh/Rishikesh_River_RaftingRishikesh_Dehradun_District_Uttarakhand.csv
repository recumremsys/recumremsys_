River rafting was better than I expected it to be. Its an adventrous activity where rapids make you skip your heart beat. You have to be ready to paddle the boat as fast as you can and at the same time be careful not to drown into the river. Wear comfortable clothes with flip flops. Try the maggi at the mid point. You can ask the river rafting guy to keep one phone in his pouch and take pictures in between the rapids.
This is something every must do. In fact the flow of water and feeling a control over the raft is an experience beyond compare. The hotel offered us a mini raft. Three people accompanied us. Two were trained lifeguards and boatman. The water was so clean n cold. We even drank it and took a dip in Holy Ganges. Enjoyed my river rafting experience.
"Be prepared to feel and soak in the adventure tourism on offer. Choose the right place and operator otherwise most people are fly by night operators. Dont look at costs because in adventure n wild life tourism the costs  are little high because of various factors. In this case the costs are for rafts the season being hardly 7 month and the staff expensive. We did the kaudiyala to shivpuri strech , it was a 3.5 hours of thrill and effort. Please note each  person on the raft has to ROW  and it is strenuous.  Do not go if you are looking for leisure, it is hard work. You have to be physically fit and active. Tents offer basic facility. Ensure you are fully covered and apply sun screen on face, if hands and legs are not covered be prepared for heavy sun tan or actually sun baked."
Adding a new experience to your travel life this is a nice place you should visit. 18 Km river rafting which was very adventurous to me.
"Looking for as many activities as we could near the holy Ganga, we chose river rafting. It was surprisingly well-organized (if you’ve travelled around India this makes sense). It is not as adventurous as rafting in other rivers, but what more could you ask for than rafting along the beautiful (still relatively clean) Ganga! A must!!"
"Must do activity for every one to over come your fears.. There are different distance to cover like 12 km,  16km,26 km 32 km.. Depending on your risk taking capacity.. We did 12km which is decent for first timers like us.. Best part was jumping in the ganges and floating with help of a rope.."
This is a must do activity when in Rishikesh. Initially we were little scared but once you are into it - it’s a lot of fun and a lifetime experience. Do not miss this.
"I do usually try to provide reviews based on saving money and travel by bikes. Would recommend to take your own tent, you can get places for pitching up your tent at Naalkanth Mahadev road. Come back and negotiate for rafting only, you may want to exclude the tent stay and food if running short. If not give it a one time shot for the whole package. But they do negotiate a lot depending upon number of pax."
Go For a 24 Km  River rafting. Enter the rapid and then you will realise the energy level and adrenaline within you. Do go for cliff jumping too because without that your trip is incomplete.
"Had an extremely amazing fun, very cheap and adventurous. Cliff jumping and raft jumping were one of the amazing experience."
Important that you do with someone who has reputation of handling the safety issues. Do not just take the service of a random service provider
"Do not look for the cheapest operator Go for the best. It is already very cheap here from IR 400 to 1000/- per head, for the same rafting. The prices differs depends on the brand's name ... their stuff  quality of life jackets their trained staff & most required ...Their behavior. Book from where you stay or agents. It will be lesser if get  direct from Their office all are open in markets n roads.we did  @ Rs 600/-  each with NORTHERN RIVER ADVENTURE but later we came to know to Preffer Green chilli. They provide an extra guard n good training.Their are 5 grades of raftings diff length.Mainly two length are considered here for new beginers1 for swimmers 16 kmsShivpuri to Rishikesh >16 kms 9 tides 2 hr2 for non swimmers 9 kmsBhrampuri-Rishikesh > 9 kms 4 tides. 3 hrBut the price diffrence is not much between both, hardly IR 100 - 200/-DO NOT CARRY much valuable things like big cameras golden  ornaments etc. A Mobile n little cash in a small personal pouch is enough the guide have a DRY BAG to keep all that into, till the session.Noting to fear but get to know their is not much medical or personal assistance in case of any mishappening. GOOD LUCK"
"Had the opportunity to do rafting both with friends and family, separately.One of the most amazing experience. The rush of the rapids, the power of the ganges and the strength of the team.. everything is amazing. Took my 8 year old son as well and he is hooked."
"Technically i am not an adventure boy at all and when ever I have tried any sort of experience,  it's always been the bad one in terms of my luck with the same However when I went to Rishikesh with friends,  they were all game for river rafting and I was not ! Between all the friends they did not hear me out and forced me to do that and once the activity was been done I loved it to the coreThe first saftey instruction  brief by the rafter and it makes you more scared and person like me who had bad experiences with regards to the adventure , however it's very good safety brief and make you aware what to do in case of emergency We had lots of fun while we were rafting and lots of places where it was super fun The guide was super cool and supportive where ever it was required Post that rafting I have been to the sane place so many times now with different team and experiencing it Loved it and super place to have fun ! Recommended"
"It was my first river rafting with family. It costs 400 per person, but before paying just confirm whether they are arranging the river rafting from Shivpuri or Brahampuri, Rs. 400 is longer route and it should cost Rs. 400. Its a thrilling experience. Everyone should enjoy this, no matter whether you now to swim or not. You can also get down to river with the permission of the Captain and enjoy the chillness of the river water. Don't try to be extra smart, maintain the safety and security measures instructed by your boat captain. Must take your video, it will be a lifetime achievement."
Great begining for my daughter and fear buster also for her against rafting. Was indeed pleasant experience and sport.
"River rafting at the Ganga keeps you enchanted with its beauty, frozen with its waters (when you cross some of the rapids in water), excited with jumping down to its waters from the 20 feet cliff, and finally makes you happy with such an experience. It's just awesome!! Go for it!"
"Being a non swimmer, I am deadly afraid of rivers. But this activity has separate levels depending on your ability and past experience. Choose easier rapids if you please, but do try it. The experience humbles yet encourages you towards the force of nature. Do bargain for prices and ask around for other options  too."
"i visited this place in 4th of  march 2015 and i enjoyed a lot that i never had before.now i am telling you why river rafting is best in rishikesh.1. flow of ganga river is very fast and it have many rapids that fills thrilling during rafting and fear sometime.2. racing with other rafting teams3. more you choose the long track more rapids you will clear and more you enjoy.this place is for thrilling and adventurous people and also for those who want to excite their life moments.we all know very well that when we go to outing or travelling with friends we enjoys a lot.but you can go with family also but please don't rafting if you are of very old age(heart patient).visit this place with colleagues, friends and relatives.i am sure you will enjoy that you will never have the experience like this.well when i visited and choose to rafting with my friends then price was:350 per personfor 13kmmore the long distance(more rapids)more you have to pay.i don't know the current price but you can bargaining."
"This is a must if you are an adventure junkie. No previous knowledge of rafting or even swimming needed, although its beneficial if you know how to swim. We visited in July, but the water was still cold enough to give us shivers. Carry an extra set of clothes as you will almost certainly get completely wet, even if you don't jump into the river. Carry minimal cameras/mobiles to prevent them from getting wet."
Try river rafting once if you are planning rishikesh there are three levels of rafting easy moderate and hard. Which is determined by kilometers.. i took the 22kms one and it was amazing.
We were a family of eight with kids so choose the basic river rafting experience. It was great: we were picked and dropped at our hotel. The guides were nice and experienced. River rafting was a wonderful experience for everyone. Jumping in the Ganga to swim after crossing a rapid was our favourite bit. Loved it enough to do it again the next day.
A must do activity when you are in or around Rishikesh. Go for 25 or 32 km rafting to experience more rapids and a lifetime experience. You can also get the video shoot of the entire journey as the raft riders have started keeping portable cameras. They will quote a higher price…
"It's a place which comes with  peace ,stunning views and a experience to be cherished for the lifetime . Going there being around the nature is one of the best feeling and being into the river ganga doing rafting  gives you major adventures goals ."
I had done couple times rafting in Ganga. I enjoyed the rafting there. This is India's best place for rafting and it's safe also. If you can't swim also no issues. Make sure that you take a good raft.
"River rafting in Rishikesh was an awesome experience!!! Though we we’re worried about safety initially but it was a super fun once we were in the water. We did three rapids and a surprise spin which was a really good. Having a proper guide and ensuring adequate safety measures which also included an additional support by way of an expert doing kayaking with us. Of course, not all rafting companies provide that but one which we hired for rafting Paddle India ensured it."
Must do. Was very impressed by the way the guides instruct you on all safety aspects.  I am sure I could have bargained on the rates but what he heck it was worth every penny. Do it in December
We went for rafting in a group of 6 in a raft with 2 other people who were managing and briefing us. It was a thrilling experience  navigating through the rough water rapids and feel the cold Ganges water splash on you. The person guiding the raft was experienced and very informative. Tried body surfing which was so much fun. Another highlight is cliff jumping into the water. What a rush! Please do try it.
"Great attraction ! Loved it !Water is a bit cold as it flows from the mountains. But still it is great, and you will have a possibility to jump from a kayak in to Ganga, do it ! Thats fun !"
This is another adventure in rishikesh that you people don’t want to miss out. Go to rishikesh pay INR 500 per person in peak season and enjoy rafting an unforgettable experience. I have tried and would suggest this experience is worth for those who want to try adventure sports or for those who have check list of adventure sports that they want to accomplish over the period of time this is not as big as the professional rafting sports but neither that easy too. And dont forget to do cliff jumping at the end from 30ft height straight in to open river.
"Chilling water, fun of floating in water without knowing to swim, hot springs, hot maggi being served, cliff jumping and those breathtaking moments of rafting.Rishikesh, amazing place to visit and the rafting a lifetime experience. I and my friends started for Rishikesh from Haridwar at about 10 AM in the morning and i don't remember exact time taken but it took probably 2 hours to reach the final place where a lot of water sports and adventure agents keep roaming. We were total 10 people so we wanted two rafts. Bargaining is a must at places like this and we did follow the tradition and got a decent deal for Rs. 450 per member for a 18 km long stretch. They took us to the base camp where we were shown the basic techniques to row and what to do in case of an emergency. Finally we started with a ""jai maa gange"" chorus. Total ten people were on a raft, eight from our group and two instructors. I was sitting in the front row, i don't know how to swim and fully relying on the life jacket i was ready of the adventure; this was the first time i was on this kind of boat. Floating on chilled water was like fun until the place we arrived at where the raft was literally about to topple. there were many such spots and the instructors had names for them. The first one frightened me, the next one gave me the experience and rest of them, i was like ""come on baby"". After a long rowing we stopped at a place as we were wet with chilled water. The place we stopped was good for cliff jumping, although the instructor forbade but I did jump, in the picture you can see that spot. Sadly its the only picture we could take. At this point hot water springs were coming from mountain and meeting the chilled water of river. Amazing place it was! Finally our experience came to an end with crossing just below the famous Laxman jhoola.Overall it was thrilling whenever those raft toppling points came, almost ten to twelve, though i don't remember exactly. By 2:30 afternoon we left again for Haridwar to catch train for Jammu."
"Being a fan of casual white water rafting, I had heard that Rishikesh was the best place to do it. And it didnt disappoint!!Gliding on the icy cold Ganga river, in midst of towering mountains is a sight to behold. The rapids are challenging themselves giving a thrilling ride from start to finish. I tried the 26km one which despite the time of over 2 hours, still felt short!!One thing to keep in mind though: Always do the rafting using a reputed company with years of experience. Things can get out of control very easily on the river."
One of the best adventurous activity. Had a super fun while rafting. Good to start by 11 so that you will be in water when there is Sun outside. We paid 600 for 26 km rafting may be because it was Saturday. I cam to know that on weekdays the rafting can be done in 450 for 32 km stretch. Best is to jump from Cliff at Maggi point.  They should identify way to take video of rafting. We also had a person with kayak. He allowed us to do Kayak which is also a super fun. We got to different bird while sitting on Maggi point. Overall a worthy experience
"They have no respect my be they never went to school. They treat us very rudely. Camping was also awful as there are 2 tent for 7 people. Camp area is too small n dirty, no proper drinking water, no equipment for cricket/ Badminton earlier they promise for the same. People involve in this package like Ajay Sharma Should be black listed for this business."
"I had an amazing river rafting trip on the Ganga organized by trip India holidays, who are the best, most experienced and safety conscious tour guides operating out of Rishikesh👍👍 If you’re brave take the 26km white water class 3+ option which had many thrilling rapids🙀Tour guides Dev Chauhan and Manish are really great and took me to a very special Babaji sacred cave for meditation prior to our rafting adventure. You must book 24 hours in advance to raft on the Ganga. Make sure to use Trip India Holidays when booking through your Hotel in Rishikesh 😊👍🙏"
