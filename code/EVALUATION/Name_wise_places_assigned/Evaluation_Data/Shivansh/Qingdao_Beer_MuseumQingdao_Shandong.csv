Its not far from the city cemter. A short ride. The museum itself more of a factory tour. But still very enjoyable to learn about history of beekmaking in Qingdao. Had so much fun there and definitely got some amazing memories.
"Walked through the old section which is now the museum and the new section that still manufactures beer in a commercial scale. The museum presented the historical information from the founding of the brewery by the Germans to to-date, a joint private and government owned enterprise. Along the way, sample of an unfiltered raw beer and a draft beer with a pack of peanuts for tasting were included in the admission ticket. A gift shop offering beer related trinkets, beer and snacks is located at the exit."
It’s about beer. How can one go wrong. Nice tours sharing the Tsingtao beer history. Try to be aware of the weather and the amount of others at the museum when choosing your day to visit. The place is quite popular and can get crowded.Fun place with good atmosphere.
"Admittedly, I had high hopes when i decided to visit the museum. Afterall, it is the beer that is synonymous with the Chinese identity. Alas, Building A, which supposedly tells you the history of the beer brand, is full of inkjet printed replicas of old labels and old historical pictures. There was very, very little genuine history remained of the beer brand. Very disappointed. Building B was slightly better. Large barrels for you to walk through and a little more info on the beer process and the live view of the can packaging process. There is a wall of beers around the world, and you can sample 2 kinds of beer, Yuanjiang 原浆 Original Brew, and Chunsheng 纯生 Pure Brew beer. I would say for 60RMB it is kinda worth its value, but then again, I would've hoped that they offered Qingdao beer flavour ice cream. Guess they have not reached that level of sophistication yet."
"If you have visited Beer factories elsewhere, you can miss the technical stuff. However, this place is unique.  Germans occupied this area (before China was considered a nation) after the Boxer Revolution.  They were only here about 20 years in all, but decided they needed beer.  This portion of Qingdao is called Beer Museum Street.  It looks like a lot of Rathskeller ps and Beer halls. Except for the language. You self tour, signs throughout are rotten in Mandarin, German and English. You choose how many beer you want and include that in your price. We chose 2. The Tsingtao (phonetic Qingdao) produced in this brewery is the freshest for the town. Beer shipped around the world is made elsewhere, in one of four other breweries. Here and only here can you buy beer straight from the kegs.  The street vendors provide a plastic bag similar to a thicker plastic one with two handles,  from a grocery store. You fill the bag, tie it off and home you go.  Some vendors are now using a fancier bag with a screw top. It is fabulously clean, clear, satisfying beer. Goes great with the very hot/spicey cuisine of Qingdao."
"Museum great even had Aussie beer in the museum, both XXXX (from my home town and James Boag from Tasmania).  I felt a little homesick when i saw the XXXX.  Qingdao makes a variety of beer and all are grea, including a great stout which i cannot get in Brisbanet.    If you are an English speaker  all the signs are in English but a guide for a first timer to a brewery would make sense of all the equipment etc.   Take the 20RMB all you can drink for one hour and enjoy hanging out with the friendly locals and you will have a great hour or two, it will make your day!"
"This second visit was bad timing as the museum was packed with large Chinese bus groups. I work in brewery business and speak Chinese, so I got myself into a ""personal tour"" thus avoiding the long queues everywhere. Choose a date when there is no festival, weekend or holiday!"
The small free glass of beer worth the visit. This is a very famous brewery in China. Had a great time at the museum.
"Loved the beer museum. Unless you're really into beer, the museum part isn't that interesting. Instead, make a bee-line to the drinking areas. First stop is a complimentary tasting of unpasteurized beer. Then comes the assembly line, which is quite mesmerizing. Afterwards, the tour ends in a large Bavarian-style beer hall with some great beers on tap and delicious sausages. Tip: get a pitcher of the Qingdao IPA and a few sausages + beer nuts. Repeat as needed.There are lots of other beer places on ""beer street"" opposite the museum, but I found their beer to be watered down. Stick with what's in the tent."
It was very exciting to go there. It was full of surprises. Beautiful place for beer lovers. Great prices & great ambiance to enjoy this. Don't miss the opportunity if you are in Qingdao.
"Great museum that shows the history of why Tsingdao beer is amazing.  Gives free beer to every visitor and depending on ticket you can get more.  I would recommend a VIP tour so you can get explanation to what you are seeing, and more free beer of different flavors."
"A museum for the ages. Check out the process of how things are done making Qingdao Beer, then get a drink halfway through of ""Raw"" beer. All I can say is, ""Sweet, bring it on!""Then see the history and the modern workings of the actual brewery to the bottling process. The historical labels are also quite fascinating!Then, drink some more beer! Shop. Walk through a house which simulates being drunk. Fantastic. Fun for the whole family. Let the kids drink beer too! Whoo-hoo!"
Had great draft beer there and shopped at the souvenir store. There is also a 20min long museum which you can visit to find out how the beer is made.
"Tsing Tao (Qingdao) beer is my favorite in China.  Getting to take a tour and see all of the history of how the Germans taught them to make beer was great.  Lots to see on the guided tour, and plenty of free sampling at the end.If you are a beer drinker (or not) and visiting Qingdao, this should be a stop on your list."
Happened to go on a very hot day and so the first part of the museum which had little air con and lots of people was quite uncomfortable but the second part was much better. Very unusual to see at the end every guest receives a free glass of beer which people were then giving to their children including young babies! There seems to be no drinking age in china so interesting experience
"This museum is okay, nothing over the top. Provides a history of Tsingtao Beer of takes approx an hour. Various ticket types sold, basic one goes for 60RMB which entitles you to two half pints, another sells for 80RMB which entitles you to as much beer as you can drink. English and Chinese maps are available with the ticket purchase, no need to get a guide as the tour is pretty simple and self explanatory. At some point during the tour, everyone gets a free half pint of freshly made beer with peanuts which is very tasty I must say. The free beer is available in the bar at the end of the tour. In case you like the peanuts that came with your beer, there is a shop in the bar area that sells some - feel free to stock up as I did."
Spent several hours in the Museum. Its was quite informative and all displays had English language translations. we enjoyed the ghostly image of the Brewmaster. Along the way you get to take a free glass of in process beer. Finally at the end you end up in a large bar also searving food and get another free glass of Qingdao. You can buy further glasses or pitchers of Beer here really cheaply. Good to have a few and watch the other visitors come and go.We recommend that you do the visit in the afternoon so you dont feel guilty about drinking beer in the morning ha ha. The Qingdao Beer street where the brewery resides if fully of lively resturaunts where you can eat excellent seafood. You could do lunch there before the Brewery tour or Dinner after you are thrown out of the Brewery at closing time - I think maybe 5pm.Anyway if you come to Qingdao you have to visit here. I meant millions of Chinese people cant be wrong - correct?
"Be prepared for hordes of people, many more interested in taking selfies than the brewery itself. The three pristine clean buildings offer a first rate demonstration of the history of Tsingtao Beer, the brewery process, and the machinery past and present. A free glass of 'raw' beer for every ticket holder, and the inevitable gift shops have reasonably prices souvenirs, and are not in way tacky."
"Went here with the family, only in China would my children be given two free glasses of beer with the tour. Great self guided tour, in English and Chinese. Entry is RMB50 or RMB70 for two sausages and unlimited beer refills."
"We happened to be in Qingdao on a Sunday, so stopped by the Beer Museum for an approx. 1-hour tour and visit.  Our Qingdao-based hosts made a reservation on our behalf, so I'm not sure of the cost of our tour.  The buildings date back to the brewery's German founders and our friendly tour guide led us through several exhibits displaying original bottle designs, production methods, bottling and canning, and welcome beer tastings were we were invited to taste the ""one-day"" and ""one-week"" beers exclusive to the brewery and surrounding establishments.  We were given earpieces so we could hear every descriptive detail from our tour guide in the sometimes crowded rooms.  The tour ended in a large tasting room with lots of beer-themed retail.  Ours host encouraged us to have our photos taken and we were later surprised with a bottle of Tsingtao with a personalized label!  Exiting the brewery there are a number of beer-inspired eateries up and down the street, with tables and chairs flowing out onto the sidewalk.  Besides driving around the beautiful coastline, and eating the local seafood, the museum was a great weekend diversion."
"We had though the brewery was open late during the week but we were wrong. Convinced the staff to sell us a pitcher of beer, the promise was we had to consume it in 20 minutes. Being a typically Canadian, always up for a challenge, we accepted. The raw beer, only good for 24 hours, is fresh from the tanks and tastes excellent compared to the pasturized product that goes into Kegs or bottles. Completed the task with time to spare, will come back when we are in the area."
Having studied 19th and 20th century Chinese history at university it was quite interesting to actually go and see the brewery and learn more about the German influence in the city. Some of the original buildings and equipment are still intact and there are photos showing the development of the brewery which were all very interesting given that I had only read about such in books. Overall a good experience and worth the trip. Funny thing is many of the local Chinese I talked to actually wished the Germans had never left as they thought now the area would be much more wealthy like Hong Kong with the British.
"The beer museum is worth a visit if you are a beer lover. In my opinion the museum should be free as you are really just learning about the history of Tsingtao beer, and the posters are mostly marketing fluff. Expect a lot of people. Okay for an afternoon."
Is a nice museum to visit. You can see all brewery and the new one. Also the history of the brewery along all its periods. The entrance include a glass of beer and a snack.
"Visited here with a friend a few months ago and really enjoyed it, well worth the money, I think around 100rmb and included two beers, one fresh and one tap, and interesting tour of the old factory ad the new one includin a drunk room which is really fun to use! Would recommend it to a friend!"
"Similar to the Heineken / Guinness museums in Europe. Interesting company history, and tasty beer provided as part of the ticket. Good value too. Try the drunk simulator! Was actually quite funny and more realistic than you think."
"Definitely a must if you are coming to Qingdao. Along with most of what's on trip advisor's app, apart from the beer city. That's only in the summer of August...The streets near by were awesome too, I don't think it's on trip advisor's app. Check out my photos for the name of the place.This was taken like a small zone of the city, easy to get to with 1 yuan buses.I felt Qingdao hasn't hit it's peak yet, plenty of construction everywhere we went. But definitely get there early, there's bus tours and plenty of people around. You get a few ""free beers"".And some cool souvenirs! Unsure of opening times"
"Take a trip through the history of the most famous Chinese beer brand. From the establisment by the Germans - into a worldwide exporting firm. TsingTao beer museum is differently worthwhile, stroll down beerstreet afterwards."
"Buy the ticket which gives some beer tasting. Well laid out. Does not explain why Tsingtao is called such when the place is Qingdao - but we found out this was due to the postal system in China being run by the French who called the place Tsingtao (using their own way of transliteration, well before Pinyin was invented). For those who like beer, a very worthwhile visit!"
"It is located near to the beer street. Nice place to learn about the process of beer processing. Based on the entrance ticket, you are entitled for 2 cups of beer and nuts."
You must come visit the brewery for the most famous Chinese beer there is. Enjoy the history of the brewery and have a fresh one. Tip: Check out the restaurants by the entrance. There's really good seafood here. Find the restaurant with the most people and you can't go wrong!.
"Lots of fun! We didn't have a tour guide but we also didn't feel that we missed out. Sure there might have been different information from a quite, but I also feel that there was enough information on the singage. At the end they have a place where you can put a photo on their beer label. Makes a great souvenir /gift, I regretted not getting one"
Been here twice but still loving it. It was fun and the beer are truely good. Dont forget to get some honey coated peanut .loving it
"This is a must do if you are in Qingdao, it is located appropriately in Beer Street and incorporates the old Tsingtao beer brewery buildings.  The buildings themselves are interesting as is the garden area outside with some old displays and statues. Inside you get to see some of the old machinery used to brew beer and you get to taste and smell ingredients used to make beer.  There is an interesting holographic of a brewer testing his product and you get to taste the beer with a free beer at your first rest stop.  Continuing your tour you enter a modernistic world through a stainless steel tunnel accompanied with bubbling brewing sounds and then into the bottling and packing area where you see the cans and bottles moving along the assembly line and packaged, this in itself is interesting as its all displayed behind glass so that you have an uninterrupted view. You exit into the souvenir shop where there are some good souvenirs to purchase and then into an entertaining area where you are provided with another complimentary beer.  This area is set up like a large open pub and has a large visual display screen showing continuous scenes of Qingdao.  This is effectively the end of your tour but you can stay here longer and can purchase further beer and I believe snack food.  This is really a fun place to visit."
"Think of beer, think of China, you get Tsingtao. Started by German colonials in1903, stolen by the  Japanese  and returned to China after the war. This is a true success story, with a interesting heritage. If you have an interest in brewing, industrial architecture or just beer you will enjoy this. From the colonial buildings, to the oldest surviving Siemens engine, floor maltings to holographic brewers. Enjoy a free taste of raw beer and compare it to the finished product. A good value visit at only CNY50."
