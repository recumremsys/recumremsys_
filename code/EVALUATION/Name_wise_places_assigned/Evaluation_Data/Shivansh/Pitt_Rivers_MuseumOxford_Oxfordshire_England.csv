"Visiting Pit Rivers is like going back in time. It is how museums used to be - which isn't necessarily good but it really shows how things were presented and the attitudes prevalent at the time. Lots of recent controversy surrounding shrunken heads fits in with the whole ethos of the place. I worry a bit about being too self righteous about the past when viewed from a modern perspective. Things happened, that we cant change, but we can learn lessons from them. Well worth a visit"
"This place is wonderfully ""Oxford"". Hidden away at the back of the Natural Museum, it has lots of ethnological exhibits. Nothing interactive or computerised, you wonder around the displays, exhibited behind glass, you read the labels - and it is all wonderfully captivating. A special from one of my last visits: if you can, visit on one of the ""Museum nights"". Once or twice a year, the museums in Oxford stay open until late night. You get a torch at the entrance, and you can start exploring. It is a special experience to wonder around multiple glass cabinets in the dark, with a torch, and with most people trying to find the famous ""shrunken heads"" to add to the slightly eerie atmosphere - very good fun!"
"Have been to Oxford a few times, and this was our first visit to the museum. It is filled with hundreds of exhibits, so I think there is something to interest every member of the family. And it’s FREE!! Donations can be made."
"Visited here for the first time - and wow!  The natural history part of this museum is full of interesting animals and hands on activities, great for children!  The Pitt Rivers Museum part was jaw-dropping and you just didn't know where to look first!  What a truly amazing collection of just about everything!!  Definitely worth a visit when visiting Oxford - and especially great for children.  Very friendly, happy staff.  My only gumble would be that they need more seating in the café area, as we were unable to obtain a table or anywhere to perch - shame, as this could be a real money maker for the museum, especially as they charge nothing on entry (a £5 donation is recommended)."
"First visited 1983 as an Oxford undergrad student.  Coming back in 2019, 36 years later, all the precious memories and artefacts are still there.Fun to share with my children.This place has character. History, scientific  rigour.Even more fun now to read the 1 star reviews.  Yes please.   Keep out unsupervised teenage groups. Some cheap tour agent throw them at the Museum (free of charge outing) and expects museum staff to manage their unruliness. This museum is part of the university.  It is not disneyland nor universal studios.  It is a 5 star joy for what it is and 1 star for what is isn't."
"Went with my son who is in the anthropology business and fascinated.  We were too.  You just wander round gazing at new, weird, curious, illuminating and extraordinary examples of what humans do and make.   Allow plenty of time."
Have been here many times but keep returning.  The collections are amazing - quirky and interesting.  You could spend hours here.  Really worth a visit if you are in Oxford.
Great museum hidden behind the Natural history - both a gem and both free! The Pitt rivers has a mouse hunt for children (or me- since they didn’t want to co-operate) which was lots of fun. Encourages children (*cough* me) to really look into the cases and open up the drawers. Only gave it 4 stars as it is quite dimly lit which I found to make me rather drousy. Got a sticker at the end though so was all worth it!
"Visited with a few friends in January. Unlike them, it was my first time. It's difficult to describe, as the exhibits are both varied and unusual. The place is packed with exhibits, almost as if they have outgrown the premises, which is accessed from the Museum of Natural…"
"Located in the back corner of the Natural History museum,  thus collection is a must see. It is my favourite museum ever! Every inch of space is packed with fascinating anthropology artefacts, but don't miss the shrunken human heads!"
This museum is at the rare of the natural history museum. Another brilliant Oxford museum. Didn’t know who Pitt Rivers was until now   Very.  well traveled guy and must have had a large house to house this eclectic collection    Just so much to see and well worth it
Absolute gem of a place. Best museum visited. Feel like I’ve been around the world! Very helpful gentleman who guided us to the grass hat!
"Made the short trip to Oxford just to explore the Pitt Rivers Museum.We were overwhelmed by cabinet upon cabinet of interesting 'stuff' - from glass beads to weapons, and from textiles to toys, it was quite an eclectic mix.In almost 2 hours we only covered floors 1 & 2, so will definitely return to visit the more extensive ground floor of exhibits. Expect to pay over £7+ for 2 hours (the max allowed) nearby on-street pay & display street parking."
"The Pitt Rivers is a must-see in Oxford. It is one of the most unusual museums you will ever visit, snuggled in the back corner o f the Natural History Museum (which is also very good!). Together, you could easily entertain your children for  several hours on a rainy day quite happily. The Pitt Rivers is an anthropological/ethnographic museum with artefacts and objects collected from all over the world and arranged thematically or topically--  not on the basis of place of origin-- which makes for a novel viewing experience. There is a section for masks from all over the world; replicas of boats; all sorts of axes; clubs  for fighting from all over the world; shields-- that sort of thing. It's quite a small museum, and so navigating it-- particularly midday on a weekend when it gets crowded-- can be a bit tricky, but it's loads of fun, with new treasures and odd bits to discover everywhere you look. Imagine if your Victorian-era ancestor had traversed every known corner of the globe, and brought back trunkloads full of exotica; and then spent a few years lovingly arranging them in glass cabinets in small showroom somewhere. That's what a visit to the Pitt Rivers is like.For children of all ages-- and it's beside University Parks, a nice place for picnic in good weather, but there's a reasonably-priced cafe on the first floor of the adjoining Museum of Natural History--  and do venture to the upper floors of that museum as well."
"Adore this museum. Friendly staff when you arrive and lots to keep toddlers entertained. Animals, stuffed animals that you can stroke and a T-Rex!"
"A great place to spend a few hours. So much to see - it’s amazing. Loved the rocks, fossils and shrunken heads...."
"No surprise that this listed for museum of the year. Attached to the Natural History museum. Rather dark but has densely packed cabinets of remarkable and thought provoking artefacts from all ages and cultures. Too much to list, too much to see in a single visit"
Spent a couple of days in Oxford and de used to visit the Pitt Rivers Museum.   My daughters loved doing the activities for kids and had a great few hours exploring the museum.  Huge collection from all over the world.  Staff were very welcoming.
I simply loving visiting The Pitt Rivers museum and feel enormously privileged to live so close to this amazing museum. It is a treasure trove of fascinating artefacts that never gets boring no matter how many times you visit. Don't visit Oxford without  a stop off here.
"A museum jampacked full of curiosity item, history, weapons and armor. I can't stress how jampacked this place is. Every square meter of display if filled to the maximum of the items able to be displayed. be sure to plan enough time as there is a lot to see combined with the natural history museum to which it is build on. When I went there was a school of children running around and making a lot of noice but I assume this isn't every day so I didn't count it in my score. Probably the only reason it's not a 5/5 is that there were so many things and I was getting tired after the natural history museum. A definite must visit"
Travelled from Northampton using the pear tree park and ride service. Explored Pitt rivers as part of our visit to history museum. Was pleased that they were attached. Some fascinating objects. Travelled with 2 and 6 year old. Eldest was a little weirded out by some objects such as the shrunken heads. They offer a paper treasure hunt which helps to keep focus. Great half day out
"Called in here to pass a few hours before going home. There are so many artifacts and interesting information, we just did not have the time to take it all in. Great for children as there are lots of interactive things for then to do. Well worth a visit, and as it has free entry, you are only asked to give a donation to help support the museum."
"Considering this museum is meant to be an 'open house' museum and there are meant to be friendly staff members we certainly were NOT greeted by any. The woman at the desk asked us if we had booked to which our college tutor obviously replied yes because we had. They had no recollection of our booking for that day and we were told to 'leave'. After a long bus journey our tutor said we could just use the toilet and then we'd be on our way however because there were primary school children, the woman who had just dealt with us told us we couldn't even go to the bathroom! after circling around the building in wet horrendous weather me and two other people decided to pitch back indoors but not in the way of those who were visiting. we then went to see if we could use the toilet only to find out they now had security people behind the massive door effectively waiting for us. The woman who dealt with us originally, saw us waiting, she then decided to approach us and tell us to leave once again, but when I replied 'we're only in here to shelter and find a place to go' she replied with 'well I'm waiting for a school group anyways'. This is totally unprofessional and whoever is higher than her should definitely be having a word with her. Just a shame I don't remember her name. She is incredibly rude and even had the guts to tell us we can't even come in dribs and drabs of three's or even two's because of the primary school children even though two massive groups had just left. considering that we told her we had a booking the way she treated us was as though we weren't welcome and therefore couldn't complete our primary research for our final major project. Not happy about this at all and do not recommend to anyone who is looking for anything informative to research about."
"Attached to the Natural History Museum, this museum has everything and anything, over 3 floors, we didn’t quite know where to look 👀 The lay out and ambience was amazing. Well worth a visit 😀"
Having read all the fantastic reviews of the museum I really was looking forward to visiting. There really is no doubt that it is an impressive collection of artefacts but I just couldnt digest most of it due to the sheer volume of exhibits crammed into a relatively small space. There was no variety in presentational style due to there simply not being enough room - for instance I cant rember seeing a single 'interactive'/'digital' display to bring the highly interesting exhibits to life a bit.Given the overwhelmingly positive reviews I guess the presentational style works for most but it just didnt click with me. I would prefer the museum to rotate its collection and focus on specialisms rather than the current catch-all approach. I feel that less exhibits with a better approach to information and bringing the 'back-story' to life would allow for a fuller appreciation of the exhibits on offer. Good examples of this practice are - for instance - The Royal Armouries in Leeds and International Slavery Museum in Liverpool.
"There's 3 floors of exhibits, lots to see and lots to learn. Check out collections from around the world with a cool back story for most if them. There are items there for everyone, from tapestries to shrunken heads, weapons, instruments and so much more"
"Had visited one before then took my friend; she too thought it was a bit claustrophobic at first, as the sheer amount of material is overwhelming, and it is grouped by theme/anthropological development rather than time/country. However, it is time well spent, and we found some curiosities and interesting labelling. Recommended but there is so much - and it does get busy - that I'd do it in small doses, and keep coming back for other bits."
"Stuffed with things stolen from every corner of the earth. This place should be horrific on every level, but it’s mesmerising as a condensed collection of the human condition"
"Came here with my sister and Mum, just looking for something to do before our trip ended. We were in awe when we arrived, the building alone was beautiful. As we walked in we couldn’t believe what a cool place it was! There was no way we could do it all properly in a day and had already decided we were going to return with the rest of our family because we knew they’d love it too. So much to look at and learn and it just all looks incredible. Had a chat with a gentleman that works there for a while and he was so lovely and had so much to say and all of it interesting and informative. Definitely recommend this museum to anyone interested in dinosaurs, minerals and all the weird and wonderful collections it holds. And it’s all for free! Which just makes it even more enjoyable. An amazing day out for anyone."
"Absolutely fascinating. Prepare to spend a few hours there. Lots of absolutely unique exhibits, such as the shrunken heads from South America. Will definitely visit again"
Have your eyes opened to so many items of interest it is a most amazing collection and there is something for everyone and it is set out in to collections to make it a little easier to take it all in.  It is not a couple of hours entertainment it takes quite a while to get round but well worth it.
Fabulous exhibition. Took several hours to take it all in. People were quiet and respectful of each other. A very pleasant experience all round.
Ideally you need to spend at minimum half a day here. Loved the Voodoo section. The bookshop could do with some thoughtful upgrade.
"Packed with accessible, relevant, and interesting information. The building is beautiful and you aren't bombarded with marketing."
"This place is amazing and a must see. Didn’t spend a long time in these but will on my next return. So much interesting artefacts on display, although seems a little cramped in having so many things to display it is a fascinating place. My highlight is the shrunken heads on display and some weird things to see in believable."
