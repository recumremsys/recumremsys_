Lovely historic place to visit. Was well impressed how big the collection was on 5 floors. Entry was free as well but donation boxes near the exit. Lovely cafe on 3rd floor was a nice touch to rest as alot of walking involved. Situation at the side of Leeds lock which is a nice place to walk if you come to Leeds it's a must see.
"Visited the Royal Armouries as we had been advised that it is a must see attraction. However as we left it until our final day in Leeds , it was impossible to really take in all the ares of interest in 6 hours. Another trip will have to be made in the future"
"What a gem. We spent at least 4 hours in the Armoury. There are 5 floors of treasures all reachable by lifts or stairs. Wheelchair access is excellent.There are folding seats which hang on the walls of every floor. Just lift one down and take the weright of your feet, then replace it and get another when you need it. The famous mask\helmet belonging to Henry V111 is on display. Reenactments take place about every hour. All this is for free. The staff are very friendly and helpful. When you think you have walked enough, you can enjoy refreshments in one of the cafes. There is also a good gift shop. You can try your skill with a crossbow. 8 bolts for £3.00. Enjoy."
Attended a Company meeting hosted on Level 3. Room was suitable for the number of people but inconvenient not having any restrooms on this level. Unfortunately didn’t get chance to look around but what I could see was interesting.
"Was taken away by the amount on display on 5 floor, amazing history and very helpful staff. Well worth a visit."
My sister and niece of 11 years visited from the Wirral. Enjoyed the visit especially the crossbow activity. Lots to see and do with other interactive displays available. There were live shows almost every hour to keep people of all ages to enjoy. Best part is it was all free. Keep up the good work and thank you for the time and effert put into the museum.
"An extensive collection with in depth information. Only issue was that it was half term and you could hardly move in some areas. Had to wait ten minutes for a lift due to queues by them and having a pushchair. The short shows required waiting for 30+minutes if you wanted a view, and lasted 5 minutes. The areas they have the shows are hemmed in by display cabinets, which make it impossible for many to view the shows. Only concession is it is free, so I can't complain too much. Will visit again at a term time weekend."
"Went here on a wet Sunday as came up as a place of interest on trip advisor.Ended up spending 2. 5 hours here as the place is fascinating. Never seen such a large collection of weapons from over 600 years ago. Easy to move around and every floor has a different theme.Had coffee and cake at the cafe which was very nice.Can't believe it's free to get in. Probably a lovely spot in the summer by the river, but not in January.Worth visiting if you're in Leeds for the weekend as we were."
"I visited with my partner, my daughter age 1 & my nephew 9. Was  surprisingly easy to find in the centre of Leeds and easy to park once we arrived. Car park literally over the road, good lifts and reasonably priced. We got there early afternoon so didn’t get time to see everything but what we did see was really interesting and informative. Tried the crossbow firing on the top level which everyone enjoyed. Food in the restaurant was good quality with plenty of choice. Coffee is beaut.All in all a great day out."
Very good museum. Its free entry and for the content and artifacts in the museum thats incredible.The staff greeting at the door were fantastic. Dressed in replica period gear and very friendly and welcoming
Visited this place in July 2019. Lovely modern building with plenty to see. My kids really enjoyed seeing all the history of British armoury. Could easily spend a half day here if not longer.
"Lots to see and do with our 11 & 9 year olds. Saw several of the movie themed shows that tied into weaponry. Plus Henry viii suits of armour. We happily spent about 4 hours wandering around interspersed with short live educational activities and shows.Good quality food at the cafe although a little pricey. Lots of toilet facilities, lifts and mobility access. Good for families and war/weapons nerds alike. Amazing that it is free too."
"Heard good things about this place so decided to go and it was free. It was kind of confusing to navigate, the signs weren't very clear but aside from this all the artefacts were amazing to look at and know that Henry VIII wore some of the armour on site. Photos were allowed as long as flash was off which is fine.  While looking around there was announcement over the intercom, whoever was on the intercom was difficult to understand because they spoke so close to the microphone. Shortly after this the fire alarm went off and we were all escorted out the building before we would be locked in as shutters started coming down. This kind of ruined the experience as were then stuck outside in the sun for 30 minutes without any shelter and the fire wardens wouldn't let us sit in the shade. I'm unsure if it was a drill as when we were allowed back inside the fire shutters were still down on the entire first floor which we had to skip as a result.  I found the Asian section was a little weird. It had weapons from almost all Asian countries aside from Korea, which was weird. The fifth floor was a little weird, it didn't really have a purpose. I don't think I would be back."
Really amazing of arms on display- my favourite the suits of armour. Lay out of the building a little confusing but great trip with teenage sons.
"I was completely amazed by this place! ❤️My family and I can spend hours here. Seeing all of the weapons and equipment is just fascinating, my son thoroughly enjoyed it. The different events that take place over the course of the day are very interesting. I can’t wait for our next trip!"
"We hadn’t initially planned on visiting the Royal Armouries Museum but we wanted to walk to the river and the museum was right there. Approaching it, you see a tall building with windows through which you can see weapons and armour hanging all the way up the walls. There was no admission fee and when you go inside, that display is even more impressive with a mirror that allows you to look up and view the whole display. The rest of the exhibits were interesting as they covered different regions, topics, and time periods. Before we left, we also visited the crossbow range where for 3 pounds, you get 8 arrows. Overall, an educational and enjoyable experience, and a great activity for a rainy day!"
Family visit to to Leeds during UK half term. Decided this would be a good option for a wet afternoon. Most amazing collection of weaponry throughout history and across the world. Great for kids too. Recommended.
"Having visited before my wife & I decided to take our 6 year old granddaughter. We parked in Leeds city & took the water taxi from behind the railway station via the dark arches. Our young traveler really enjoyed the short (12minute) trip at £1 each one way which drops right outside the museum. One thing to watch for is the boat capacity is only 12 people which includes toddlers & is strictly enforced so you may not all get on which would lead to about a half hour wait for the boats return.The museum is free we went in & looked around the first two floors which has many interesting exhibits & watched a sword fight demo. Then we went out & tried the Maze which out little one thought was great, followed by a short walk over to Pizza Express for lunch, we then returned to see the other floors before returning via the water taxi, however this time we just missed out due to it being full & had a 30 minute wait as I mentioned. The city can be reached by about a 1/2 hour walk but we decided to wai."
Visited with family including children (10 & 8) and it well exceeded our expectations. The museum is free to visit and car parking nearby will cost less than £10 even if you stay all day. The children loved the displays which worked well for the adults as well and were very professional and informative. We need to go again as 5 hours passed with still tons to see. Thank you.
"Visited several years ago with the kids, had forgotten how huge the building was.  Five floors of arms and armour make for an interesting visit, the shows where aspects of the collection are brought to life are interesting to watch."
This is a fascinating museum with plenty to see and all very well presented. Spent several hours there quite happily. We will certainly go again
Very interesting Museum. Although it is displaying things meant to kill human beings it is interesting to see their evolution. The Museum is Wells organizer and free of charge to visit. Recommended.
"Had the day on my own during a recent visit to Leeds, so decided to walk to this museum and boy am I glad I did. Fabulous musem, spread over a number of floors, with a wide range of exhibits. There is so much to see here and it is so well laid out - and it's free. Would strongly recommend this to everyone, it ranks as one of the best museums I have ever visited and I've been to a few over my lifetime. I was there for several hours but need to go back a few more times to really take it all in. It also has a very good cafe with a good choice of food. Thank you for a very uplifting experience."
Put it on your bucket list.Fantastic day out with so much to see.It helps of cause to now about war to bring everything together.If your interest are 'Love Island' then don't bother with any museum.'The greatest risk to our heritage is ignorance'.
"I had never visited before but was blown away with this place. Would 100% recommend it to anyone for an amazing day out. The armoury has live action performances and a variety of events and different exibits, including artwork. It was full of information and so much to see and interact with. Was very impressed with it as well as the exhibits the armoury has a gift shop and cafe on site."
Visited in the summer with my elderly mother and sister. We done the water taxi from the city centre to the museum for £1 per person. The Armouries are a very interesting place to visit and ideally you could spend the whole day in there wandering around the numerous exhibitions. There are various live demonstrations throughout the day and we would certainly visit again. Overall a cheap day out for the whole family.
Went there about a month again in a Saturday. I had heard about but never been. I was amazed at how big it is. We worked our way through each section in order. But the time we got got the middle it all started to look the same. Up until the floor with the elephant which I enjoyed. Do take the golden elevator if you can find it to the top floor. Overall a great 2.5 hours of history.
"We struggled to find it and were not sure what to expect but were amazed by what you get for free. Don't judge it by the front or the reception where staff just sit about looking at each other. The shows and performances are incredible. Its like being in a film and seeing a live action film in person. There were lots of teenagers on a school trip but they were well behaved and the place is so huge that you don't even notice them. Plus its good to see them in a museum and learning. There were members of staff getting artefacts out for them and keeping them entertained, which is great to. Highly recommended!"
Very interesting and something for everyone. Great cafes and plenty of parking nearby. Plus it's free entry! Looking forward to going back.
Had a fantastic couple of days visiting the museum. Easy to get to from the train station. Cafe on the ground floor serves lovely food at avreasonable price. Plenty of exhibits and things to do. The shop stocks a variety of gifts books and toys for all ages. Well worth a visit.
"A very disappointing visit to a museum we have wanted to go to for a long time.  When you exit the very expensive car park there is no signage (theme of the day) for The Armouries. So we toddle the long way round, mentioned this to the meeter & greeter who found it amusing. Handed a flimsy leaflet for displays that would be taking place. We didn’t buy the £5 Souvenir Guide Book as it was more Souvenir than Guide. The signage is appalling in the museum and there are no Museum Assistants visible in the exhibit “rooms” to interact with. There is no flow to the exhibits, you need night vision binoculars to read some of the descriptors, all descriptors are in English only, no audio guides available and no story attached to many of the exhibits. It felt like a hoarders overflow warehouse. This museum has so much potential but is poorly curated. The shop underlined this as in a display ‘Myths & Legends’ the goods on offer were Star Wars and Game of Thrones merchandise!The cafe is overpriced and the toilets were average. They are checked hourly and the one I visited had been checked 2 hours in advance of my visit!We would much rather pay for a Museum visit and have it curated in a more inviting and inclusive way. And have it staffed by people interested in the collection."
Really enjoyed visiting this museum and such a wide range of exhibits. Can spend a good few hours here without getting bored. Highly recommended. I really enjoyed the section Oriental on level 4 with the elephant in armour including exhibits from the Mughal India era. Has a cafe on ground floor along with a well stocked souvenir store. In the city dock area. There is a multi storey car park next to the museum and also some free short term street parking less than 5 minute walk away if lucky to get a space.
Visited the Royal Armouries and spent three hours here - could have been a lot longer! Fascinating collection of arms and armour split into different time periods and locations. Highly recommended.
"Fantastic museum- huge variety of exhibits and shows- all for free! Would recommend to anyone, could easily spend all day here if you go round the whole place and watch all the shows. Had a great day out here!"
"Amazing. Had wonderful displays and actors, great cafes and gift shop. It is free to get in, and has 5 floors with different armouries from many eras. Would definitely recommend for people interested in the context of what the museum has to offer."
