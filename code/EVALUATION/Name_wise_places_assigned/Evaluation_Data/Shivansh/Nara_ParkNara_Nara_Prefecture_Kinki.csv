"The park is beautiful, deer are very cute and it was only a short train ride from Osaka, the Japan Rail Pass covered the ticket from Osaka station. There were more deer then I thought there would be! Make sure to bow at them, as they will bow back (usually if you have food for them). When we got the biscuits a lot of deer did run up to us, so just be aware of that. But they just want your biscuits!"
"Nara is ca 40 min metro ride from Osaka. Nara is famous for its park, full of deers and the temple.Be careful of deers, especially if you have those cakes that are sold and deer seem to love. The deer easily check your pockets and ones with horns can push quite aggressively. Bowing is important for Japanese and these deer can bow for the cakes.Visit also Todai-ji Temple and others.Summary: Very nice with children, however deers are wild life and unpredictable."
"Nara park is the biggest and best natural park in Nara, Japan. We went on a holiday which means so many people. The parking place was quite far. Going to the park, there is a museum, deer park and temple. The deer comes from the mountain where they sleep, then they go to the park. These deer are so friendly, and the park sells biscuits for you to feed them.it is a very unique experience. The park is also so clean. This is a must see while in Osaka. It is about 1 hour from Osaka. Highly recomended."
I visited Nara as a day trip from Kyoto.  It's about an hour by train.  This is a nice park to have a walk in spring.  The deer in the park are an attraction.  It's fun to watch.  Search for the quieter places to escape the crowds.
"This park's nearest station is Kintetsu-Nara Station. From the station, it is about 10 to 15 mins walk till you hit the inner park. There are a lot of deers roaming around freely for you to feed. Along the path from the station, there will be some vendors selling the biscuits that you can buy to feed the deers. Some deers are really hungry and aggressive and they see your stack of biscuits.It's a good place to visit and walk around the park and I feel that overall it is a fun experience. Try bowing to the deers and they will follow you. Best to take some boomerang photos.The park also leads to the Todaiji Temple but do note it is quite a walk. Use Google maps to navigate."
Had a great time on our day trip to Nara from Kyoto.  It was a short 45 minute ride from Kyoto Station using the JR line. No need to make seat reservations. Visited the temple which was nice but we didn’t bother paying to go in since we have been to so many temples already. We saw lots of deer in the park. Some of the deer can get pretty aggressive when you feed them by nipping in your clothing to get your attention. It seems that the deer that were further into the park were better behaved so I would bypass the initial crowds and go closer to the museum. It was real cute to see some of the deer bow in order to get the cracker. I wasn’t able to do it but saw some who did. Museum was pretty good as well.
Nara park is a must visit if you’re around Kyoto/Osaka area. You can visit the deer in the park or walk to the nearby Todai-ji temple where there are more deer. Buy the crackers (only thing you should feed the deer) and allow them to bow their heads for some crackers. Hint do not show them all your crackers and if they become aggressive show them your empty hands. They are very used to humans. The male deer have their antlers cut off (sadly) so they cannot hurt humans. Do not run from the deer they will chase you! Overall good experience.
"Going to Nara Park is a must do if you are in Kansai area. We went on a day trip on our own, riding the train from Kyoto to Nara. A few minutes walk from the train station, we experienced our 1st encounter with the deers who were just lazing around waiting for people to feed them. Walking thru the large expanse of the park, we encountered more deer and took some great shots of them and with them while feeding them.  It was our first time to experience being with deers unhampered by fences like you see in the zoo. Overall, an experience not to be missed."
"Caught the Train up here from Osaka and walked from JR Nara Station - almost directly due East - up a wide quite modern Avenue, then past the 3-Storye Pagoda, the Kofukuji Temple, then the 5-Storey Pagoda, then came to the Park.I was not ready for the Herds of Bowing (sic) Deer, hundreds of people feeding them and hawkers selling packets of Deer Pellets. Apparently they are sacred (hence all the 'bowingb - it's done by people, not Deer), so everything is tolerated and they (the Deer) know it. They also stick their cute noses everywhere trying to find something else to eat, so after the novelty wears-off, and you have the cute shot, they are a darned pest  and one has to look where one treads, as despite the sweepers best efforts, they produce more than anyone had bargained-for.There are some shrines, pagodas and temples for good measure, but all were mobbed by people, deer, tourists and School Groups on Tours - the Japanese love organised Tours.It will take a while to get round, due to the Deer, Mob of people and Entrance Queues."
"Nara Park is one of the must-see areas in Nara City. Sika deer who are considered messengers of the gods freely live in the park. Most reasons of tourists to visit Nara Park is coming close, taking photos and feeding the deer with ""Sembe"" (deer cracker). Most of them who have been cut antler are hungry all times. Some of them  bite or bow to visitors to ask for food, steal food from hand, bite the hands while feeding. Be careful walking on deer stools and walking up to the deer and take a photograph with them or feed them with deer crackers."
"Nara park isn’t far from the station and on a hot day a lot of it is under shade. The deer are very friendly and I was happy to see that the way people were interacting with them was ethical. You can buy the crackers for 150 JPY. The deer will ‘bow’ (some just do a head nod) for a bit of biscuit. Be careful, once they know you’ve got biscuits they can get a bit Pushy! It was lots of fun and a great low cost activity. We took he train from Kyoto, and we thought it was definitely worth the trip!"
"Nara Park is not a specific location. Asking where to find deer in Nara is like asking where can you find water in the Pacific. They’re literally everywhere in the temples complex. Just go to Todai-ji temple and the entrance is filled with deers trying to come and lick you. The park adjacent to it and covering a large part of Nara city’s central area is full of deers. You can feed them if you wish. There are many hawkers selling deer snacks for 100 yen, and giving them snacks causes them to congregate. You don’t necessarily need to walk in this park to enjoy feeding the deers, it’s just a very nice preserved attraction by the city of Nara to enjoy time with these cute animals."
"Nara deer park is unique and well worth a visit. There are deer roaming everywhere, even in the middle of roads!You can pat and feed the deer. Be warned that they will mob you and push you around when they see you buy a pack of biscuits, this can be overwhelming for small children. The general Nara area has nice to walk around and the train ride there has interesting scenery. My only negative - I’m not sure how healthy it is for the deer to be eating biscuits all day every day."
"Nara Park offers a nature encounter unlike any other in Japan. Hundreds of deer, regarded as messengers of the gods in the Shinto religion, roam freely in the park. Being able to interact with them is almost like a spiritual experience. The deer are tame and affectionate, and can be fed by visitors with biscuits sold by vendors at the park. The adjacent Todai-ji temple is a stone's throw away. The park is easily accessible by public transportation. Highly recommended."
We visited Nara Park and the Kasuga - taisha Shrine on a lovely sunny spring day. Feeding the sacred deer was cool. They are everywhere and are very friendly and a bit cheeky. Buy a few biscuits from the local vendors for about $2.00 AUD. Stand in front of a deer and the deer will bow to you prior to getting a feed. The park is manicured and has history. It’s a really nice place. The deer will give your clothes a nip if they don’t get a biscuit but they don’t hurt. The walk uphill to the shrine is pretty easy and you’ll pass stone lanterns on the way. These lanterns hold peoples wishes which they light in fire. I’d recommend this spot to visit for a few hours.
"Visited the park in mid Jan and was charged 200 yen for deer biscuits. Although wild, the deers are so used to Humans they almost seem docile, just minding their own business in this protected park. Animal instincts kick in when it comes to feeding with some, so conditioned, they have learn to bow for their treats.Just a tip, if you get tired from walking, a one way or one stop bus trip to both the train stations cost 220 yen. Although the JR passes are not valid with regards to bus use, those with Suica or ic cards can use them. Allocate between 3 to 4 hours to visit this attraction. Its a beautiful place."
"It is one of the best highlights of my Japan trip. You have to stay at Nara Park half day or whole day to enjoy the deer. Beware of those deers with horns as they will run into you if they see you have food. You have to show them your hands are empty so they will stop attacking you. But overall, twas a nice experience. I stayed at the park the whole day just to enjoy na nature and the deer. Very relaxing exeperience."
"Nara Park is a must to see and it's huge. Been there last month and the different colors and shapes of the trees and leafs are just simply unique, so as the view. If you go when there is not a big crowd, then even better because you can enjoy the peacefulness of the park. Plenty of cute deers that you can feed. There are local people selling the proper snack so you can feed the deers and it's pretty cheap and reminds me a thin smelly waffle. But 1st do show respect and do a small bow to the deers before you feed them. They will do the same. It's amazing and fun!!There are signs as well, to be careful with them as even though they are cute, you can't forget that they are wild animals and walk freely. Probably I don't have to write it, but ....Please do respect this beautiful place and don't trow any of your garbage on the floor as the deer might eat it and you will be spoiling a beautiful place.Better take a little bag for your garbage and then bin. I took a plastic bag from a deer's mouth, that was trying to eat it. Not cool."
"Managed to cover all the 3 shrines and the deers in Nara within 2 hours upon arriving in Nara.  In Japan, everything is well organized and nearby.  A day trip is sufficient for those wanting to see the deer"
It was a lovely get away from the busy city. Do take note which train you are using to visit this place. 1 train station is Nara station (15 mins walk) and the closes station to the Nara park is called Kintetsu Nara (5 mins) There are plenty of deer around the park. Be careful with your deer biscuit - don’t show the whole stack biscuit on your hand otherwise their will come in a group to greet you. Some deer will bite if you don’t give them biscuit. Please be careful and watch after your small children. It’s best to have a sign - to find where is the rubbish bin to dispose all this biscuit wrapper. Even the toilet nearby the temple don’t have a rubbish bin.
"This place is amazing!  Not only does it have beautiful historical temples for the adults to see, but all the deers also kept my 2 young kids entertained.  They had great fun feeding those deers.  Be careful of the males, they get aggressive.  This is not to be missed when you are in this area."
"The Nara park is definitely worth a full a day trip. The park is unbelievably vast and beautiful with friendly, brave deer walking around the place. Take your time walking around and photographing everything, but remember to respect the boundaries, and take a while to just breathe and enjoy the view of this sanctuary.The temples, the stairs, the shrines and the monuments are breathtaking. Whether you love architecture, history, animals or nature, this place brings it all together.It's a little difficult to find a place to eat here, although there are many, but they're scarreted around and if you ream free, you could end up just not running into any of them. I would not be afraid of getting completely lost, though, for there are always people around to ask for help."
"Make your way to Nara and enjoy some local ""wildlife"". You can buy special deer crackers and feed the relatively tame beasts if you dare. I was out of crackers and one of the deer started to bite my pockets and then proceeded to take a nibble of my leg! It did not hurt but I was unprepared for this brazen attack! It was funny seeing Chinese tourists run away from multiple deer as they clutched lots of crackers. We even saw a 2 year old get head butted, but the little guy didn't cry or make a sound. He was totally fine so then it was funny. It is a surreal experience to interact with these normally reclusive and skittish animals. They do bow their heads (some more then others) to get crackers from time to time which is pretty cool. It is a nice place to visit and you can walk around some temples close by if you would like as well."
"Accessible by buses from the train station.Never wear brand new or expensive shoes to this park as stepping on the deers' poops are inevitable (they are everywhere, so are the deers).The deers are already used to humans feeding them with the deer senbei (wafers) that you can purchased around the park. They will bow to you, in return you are to offer them with the wafers. They may become slightly if they are not presented with food, and nibble on your bag or clothes, so do make known to them if you do not have food available (show them your open & empty palms).Other than that, they are really nice to hang out with.I must also highlight, please refrain from feeding any other types of food (and definitely not non-edible stuff, because I have witnessed it there!) except the wafers made just for them. Let's help keep the nature & animals alive for our future visits."
"This is a huge and lovely park, with a great museum and several separate UNESCO sites worth a visit.  It's also home to the quasi-tame sacred deer; the deer run the place, and most of the cit near the park, and can get pretty feisty when they think you've got food, to the point of chewing on backpacks and climbing on people holding the ""deer crackers"" many vendors sell.  Keep in mind it's their park and act accordingl."
"The park itself is a very unique place to walk through, with all the statues and lanterns all about.  It would be quite amazing to re-visit when they are all lit (I'm told twice a year).  It's very much a park feel, though greatly covered with trees along the stone paths and multiple small buildings / shrines scattered all about.  Do watch out for the deer, particularly if they think you've got food in your hand.  They have no problem trying to eat your clothes/books or engaging in a brief chase if you try to get away (hint: they move faster than you)."
"We had the 7-day JR Pass and took the Yamatoji Line from Tennoji Station to Nara Station. It was a fair distance to Nara Park, so we opted for the Nara city Loop Bus, 1-day pass, which was a good decision, for 500y.  You'll need to wait at Bus stop No.2.  Walk out of Nara Station building and seek the locals' advice on where Bus stop No.2 is located.  They'd be most willing to guide you.  There was a long queue, but it moved fast.  The bus dropped us at Nara Park, which was so convenient.We saw lots of deers roaming around.  A few approached us leisurely.  One, in particular, came up to us and began to sniff at our bags and pushed his nose against our bodies!  One of my sisters was squealing in fright.We didn't buy any crackers to feed them because we had the earlier experience at Miyajima Island, where they more you feed them, the more aggressive they become.There were many people around, taking pics, and patting the deers.  They seemed very tame here.It was drizzling, the ground was wet and we had to use umbrellas.  After taking some satisfactory pictures, we decided to take the city loop bus to see the rest of Nara city, while the younger ones in our group continued on to visit Todaiji Temple."
"This beautiful park nestled amongst magical temples on a shady hillside is full of sacred deer , around 1200 of them. They are wild and roam around freely . It is possible to have a truly magical experience when interacting with them if you know what to do and what to avoid. The sacred temple deer have been trained to bow to people when people bow to them . It is truly a sight to behold . It is a considered a crime in Nara to feed the  deer anything other than the deer biscuits on sale from vendors in the park . When you buy these biscuits the deer will come up to you and if they are in a group may surround you and try to get you to feed them . It is not a good idea to try to feed a group of deer as they jostle for attention and can bump you or even bite. It is not a good idea to be backed into a corner by a group of deer . The best way to feed them is to buy the biscuits , put them away quickly into your bag (Preferably on your back)  and walk away briskly from the group of deer . Find a single deer standing on its own  away from the stalls . Then bow to it. It will bow back and then you hold out your hand and feed it a biscuit . They take them from you very gently when they are on their own . Like humans deer have their own personalities and some are really gentle and some more forceful. I met some incredibly gentle deer who were so polite and bowed and let me gently stroke them once I had fed them . I let them come toward my hand to be stroked I didn’t try to pet them uninvited . I loved the experience it was truly magical and if you follow what I have described I hope you too will have a wonderful day with the deer."
"Large park, vile toilets, cranky deer. We rode a bus from the train station to the park, which was easy and short. A large grassy park with oodles of adorable deer. The novelty wears off when the deer start gouging their horns into your children, or biting at your clothes and skin. Apparently not all of the deer care for the ‘hand signals’. The toilets are the worst. I’m not a precious person, and I’m pretty tolerant of all kinds of smells but - wow. Bring as much hand sanitiser as you can carry. We managed to go on a hot day, the museum was closed, and one of our kids got sick. We walked back to the station without seeing anything else."
Visited recently to take in the Golden Buddha and the deer around the temple and park.  Beautiful place and the temple was awesome.  The deer are friendly (particularly if you have food) but very entertaining in there own way.  A great way to spend a few hours.
"Strolling around this park and feeding crackers for deer is the reason coming to Nara. Deers are walking in the park freely and they are not shy to ask for foods.We had fun here, they are not so wild as I thought. I was with my young kid. I was so nervous when I saw my daughter beat the deer because it tried to eat my paper tag of the stroller. But the deer did not get mad, it may know that my daughter is very  young kid and it did not bite her or kick her. The deer is very humanize.There is a temple after passing through the deer park. It's just like all other Japanese temple. I went inside and made a wish then we heard back for lunch.It was a very special and pleasant day trip.I highly recommend you to come here.Tip: Nara Park is a five minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station  but  20 minute walk from JR Nara Station. Tip: Hide your crackers as deer may steal them.Tip: Go early as it's a popular spot, deers maybe full if you come here in late afternoon"
"It’s a beautiful and peaceful park. You can see deers everywhere to walk with you and ask your food. Don’t feed them too rush and too many, just little by little and avoid attracting too many deers around you, otherwise you may feel scared. I like to sit on the grassland to enjoy the calm atmosphere. Luckily we can see some red maples even it’s early November."
Visited the famous Nara deers. Docile and only interested in humans with deer snack. Snacks are sold at fixed price by vendors at various points in the park.
"A half-day trip is more than enough to enjoy the whole area. Once you get out of the train station, take right and start walking. Enjoy the scenery all the way long. No need to take the bus, it's nearby."
"A short walk out from the train station, the deer are walking around, sitting under the trees, etc.  There is a small stand where 2 elderly women are selling crackers in bunches - to feed the deer.  Be careful!  The deer will walk over to you, a little too aggressive for me! I dropped half my crackers trying to get away from them.  They tug at your clothing, push you... it's a little scary.  I pushed my daughter out of the way and tried to feed them as quickly as possible, thank goodness she wasn't holding the crackers!We walked along the path to the temple, and found other stands selling crackers, and there are less deer assembled, so feeding them is much more enjoyable.  My daughter chose to feed the smaller deer, and they were so adorable!  Some of them bowed every time she gave them a cracker!!!  I got such good photos and videos, she LOVED IT!"
