The place to be if you want to share powerful vibes and songs. Let's your body talk to you during the Aarti and just be grateful to life
"Go to the Ashram and have lunch, great value for money.  Good to walk round, join in the classes, one is made to feel most welcome."
Felt blessed attending the evening arti and chants - a must!! It was crowded but the good part is that the arti thali is passed through out and enough time for everyone to hold. The Guru ji had very positive and excellent messages for the attendees which will help out earth and can educate a lot of locals and visiting devotees.
"A spiritual experience not to be missed. A traditional ceremony by the ganges, amazing and heart warming. Do not miss the Satsang after in the Temple. This is one of the places I miss most after returning home. It now holds a special place in my heart and I will be back as soon as possible. Anyone going to Rishikesh has to experience an evening there. Also the food in the canteen was great."
"I had heard a lot about this place and was very hopeful to see divinity from a close quarter but was highly disappointed as the entire machinery was geared up to take money from visitors, be it in the name of aarti or stay.  Found the entire street filled with sadhus who were well bodied and still held out their hands for seeking charity"
It is good place for yoga lovers and religious people. Evening Aarti is must do activity. Book room in advance through their website if you want to stay in ashram. That have Ac and Non AC both rooms
Going to Parmarth Niketan since childhood (35 years) regularly and seeing that it is becoming more commercial like lodge & hotels. Now you don't feel the calmness and satisfaction. Evening Ganga Aarati has converted to a marketing event to earn money.
"Excellent get up. Very sombre ambience. Kitchen serves very tasty food at very affordable rate to everyone. Rooms are very clean, modestly decorated and priced reasonably. Booking done on line. Popular among tourists both National and International. Gangs artist in the evening is a real crowd puller. Must stay while in Rishikesh. Provision stores are available with good stock.its one of the prestigious and famous Ashram. People from different countries came here for practice Yoga. Very religious and peaceful atmosphere .you can see holy river Ganga. Rooms available simply clean room & little expensive . Ashram atmosphere is better holy & peaceful.."
Visited here to attend ganga aarti. The bhajans are very soothing. We went as a group. It's an experience to cherish.
"The set up of the Ashram is really beautiful. Loved the way everything is so well organised, they hv a large canteen too where one can eat at lunch/ dinner or even in between tea times at very nominal rates. The Rath at the entrance to Ganga ghat is beautiful, was awed by Hanumanjis statue & Shivjis across the stairs in the Ganges. They started with a Hawan & beautiful recitation of bhajans, shlokas & then Guruji came along --- it was a wonderful sight to see such young disciples chanting along. We too were given the Arti to perform at the Ganges. Lovely experience, very Divine."
"Stayed at Parmath Niketan Feb 4 to Feb 8.  Beautiful grounds, excellent Aarti, room with view of Ganga.  But room was cold and drafty and dimly lit. Not particularly clean, but hey it's an ashram.  Shower has NO PRESSURE at all- hard to wash hair, took forever even for a basic shower. If someone flushes- you get scalded.  Upside?  did not run out of hot water."
Used to be very good once in 1982. But its ok as the development takes place. Gardens are ok and peaceful. Did not see any sage outside the building. Arti area is very good
"This is one of the famously ashram in Rishikesh. There is a beautiful garden inside, and every evening they organise a ceremony above the Ganga.Lot’s of foreign artists come to play music and sing.An amazing ambiance with the sunset over the river. Don’t miss it !"
Situated near Ram jhula is this busy but quiet ashram. It has beautiful temples of all important Hindu deities. Guides help you with detail explanation of aspects of Hindu mythology and events. Ganga Aarti at this ashram is well known and tourists and pilgrims from all over participate here. However If you are only for short trip to rishikesh don't miss the Aarti at the triveni sangam. That is somewhat like varanasi style.
"Parmarth Nikaten is very famous place of Rishikesh for spiritual activity. Yoga, Ganga darshan,Ganga Arati are main attractions. Situated on the left bank of Ganga river. Some years ago Lord Shiva statue is constructed along or in the deeply submerged area of left bank  creates beautiful view or spiritual view for meditation or worship."
"Situated on the bank of river Ganga ,this is a famous spot for the famous Ganga Aarti . Quite serene and peaceful spot . A few good temples here are very nice . Lots of activities keep on happening here . A must visit"
