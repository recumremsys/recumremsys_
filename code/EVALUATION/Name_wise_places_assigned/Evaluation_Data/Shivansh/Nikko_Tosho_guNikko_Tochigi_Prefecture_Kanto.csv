"Spent the day here and it is a very nice temple. 2hrs by train from Tokyo so it’s quite a nice day trip. You can get the bus outside the station to the temple.  One thing to note, in Japan you get on the bus at the back entrance and you exit the bus by the front which is when you pay.  Note the number on the screen on the bus when you get on. It will say your stop number and a price, you pay that as you get off.  It’s about 290 yen per person from the station to the temple, so have change on you."
If you only see one temple in Japan this should be it. Staying overnight inNikko allowed us to be at the temple before any crowds. We didn’t hire audio guides and found there was sufficient information in English around the sights to give us adequate background information.…
"This is an interesting shrine and we took a day trip from Tokyo to visit this shrine and a few others. Renovations to the main gate had just been completed, very shiny and clean and in my view detracts slightly from the expected ""look"" for an ancient shrine. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience, we did not feel crowded out although there were many folks visiting at the same time but getting a nice picture was a little difficult. Do take the many steps up to the reputed resting place of the shogun (but this part is not for old folks or very young children). You can take the shuttle bus from the nikko station but please be mindful of the timings in case you need to take the train back to Tokyo on the same day."
"Nikko is a fantastic place, if coming by train your last link takes you onto a beautiful retro styled train up the mountainside to Nikko proper. outside the station to a countryside square. The village looks up the small valley to a forest of trees (covered in snow in my trips). If you wander up the hill you will find yourself at the start of the major shrine complex of Tosho-gu just after crossing the river. The stone steps and ramps wind their way up till you make the enormous tori gates. The complex itself has a combination of the more subtle Japanese Temples, but is also one of the most gaudy i have been to done in filigree and ivory. The carvings are stunning. If visiting i strongly recommend bringing your Goshuincho, or purchasing one to be filled out. (Just make sure to pay your respects first), as their are several spots on site to receive the stamp.I've been to Japan twice as well as Nikko now and will plan to make Nikko at least my one re occurring stop every trip from now. If you like nature and temple or shrines architecture and history stay a few days. Theres a lot to see."
It's a great place to visit. Get close to nature as you walk towards the main shrine. Ieyasu Tokugawa's grave can also be found here. Don't miss the iconic three monkeys.
"Wonderful wooden sculptures and great colours. There are many steps, so watch out. We were there on a day full of school kids that came to practice their English with us. Was sort of funny, didn't really have a silent moment in the place."
"To see Nikko properly you need two full days. A day trip from Tokyo is tricky to do more than one of the following. - TIME: You’ll have to take the JR Nikko or Tobu rail to Nikko station which takes about 40 mins from Utsumoniya. Then either walk 30 mins into town (seeing all the shops on the way) or take a bus pass so you can reach all the sights. Get there as early as possible if you’re there for the day. - BUS PASS: about 3000 yen each for the two day pass. Or less for a day pass. It’s worth it to save your legs and time! If you only have 5 hrs then just relax and aim only for the shrines - Toshogu and other shrines: it’s NOT cheap to go around the shrines. To get into Toshogu it’s 1300 yen as an adult and 500 yen for the audio guide. id definitely pay to go in and get the audio guide to the main sights. Lots of explanation. If you get there early you miss the crowds. This will take about 2 hours at least! - relax over lunch: find a local restaurant to enjoy Yubu which is a local delicacy! - Shinkyō bridge: don’t have to pay 300 yen each to cross the bridge, you get to see it very clearly and get a better photo from the man made bridge right next to it!Lake and waterfall: if you have one day you REaLLY CANT do the shrines and this and also enjoy yourself. After taking the JR Nikko you have to take a 50-60 min bus to reach this area. Then it’s about 3-4 hrs to enjoy the walks and scenes minimum. Maybe take a sandwich, definitely take water if hiking or doing a long walking."
"A must visit for any visitor to Japan. All the history, delightful Japanese intricate architecture, culture, history, serenity....all rolled into one. This entire place will set you back as there are multiple entry fees to different sites. But it's all worth while. Take your time and budget sufficient time to soak in the wonders of this place. We spent 1 entire day here. Can't get enough of it."
"This is an absolutely must-see when in Nikko. My husband and I went to the other temples/shrines/mausoleums before going to the big one, probably best to do in that order. Get the English audio guide for ¥500 (we got one between the two of us), it makes the tour more impressive with the information they provide. GO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. The crowds, particularly the bus tour groups, get ridiculous as the day goes on. We went on a Monday at 11am and it was very busy."
We were lucky to visit the Shine after snow fall to have the feel of winter in this famous world heritage site. The compound of this Shine is big and the buildings are very well preserved in each of the corner. Prepare to walk in on long and steep steps as the Shine is built on a hill. Visit in the early morning is a better strategy to avoid crowds from tour buses.
"Nice to walk around and see the different shrines. Make sure to check out the dragon shrine where you could hear „the roar of a dragon“, they had some explanation in Ebglish although the majority of tourists were locals so we found it very kind of them. On the opposite side, there are many stairs up leading to the tomb of the monk.. not aure how worth it except for the view from above."
"You can see why it is a World Heritage Site. Astounding architecture in stunning landscape. Having declined the audio guide, I regretted the decision as I wanted to understand more of the history than was available on the signage."
"This beautiful temple is a must-see if you're visiting Japan.  Wander through the temple, admire the exquisite attention to detail, and soak in the history (it was built in the 16th century).  Specifically, look for the carving of the Three Monkeys, which are the basis for the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil"" monkeys that are common nowadays.  It's a calm place, even when there are a lot of visitors."
"Travelers to Japan should visit this site. You can feel the atmosphere from the old days, and you would almost expect to see samurais around the corners. Don't miss out the trip to the Nikko Shrines"
"Was skeptical about visiting a famous site in Japan, after having encountered zillions of tourists at other places.Was pleasantly surprised that this one was much less crowded and therefore easier to enjoy..I've seen many temples and shrines in Japan. Needless to say they don't hold a candle to Toshogu. Absolutely stunning."
Toshogu Shrine is astonishing - worth going to even when full of visitors. Be sure to walk up the pathway to the smaller shrine up in the woods.
"Did this as a day trip from Tokyo, approximately 2 hours each way. Once in NIkko it is about a half hour walk to the temples. You can take a bus, but I enjoyed the walk.  The walk at times is somewhat steep if you have trouble with that. The temples are basically in a large park/forest and that makes them even more lovely. A guide would have been helpful to understand more of what I was seeing, but the setting and the temples were just beautiful and a nice break from Tokyo."
"So the first thing people need to understand is that getting to Nikko to visit the World Heritage Shrines (including Nikko Toshogu Shrine) and Shinkyo Bridge is something you can do by yourself as a Day Trip from Tokyo.  BUT you do need to be leaving Tokyo early, by that I mean no later than 8:00am, by train.  I will now walk you through the route I took and the costs involved, which I hope will be of great help to others.I was staying in Shinjuku so my travel starts and ends there but as Shinjuku is a prominent and easy station to get to my route could be easily followed.  Note there are other routes you can take but my research found the cost and timings of this one to be best.  So from Shinjuku I took the Saikyo Line (JA) 4 stops to Akabane Station (15 minute ride). From Akabane Station I then took the Utsunomiya Line (JU) 11 stops to Kurihashi Station (46 minute ride).  This portion of the journey cost JPY990 using a Suica Card (a train pre-payment card). From Kurrihashi take the Tobu-Nikko Express Line (TN) 7 stops to Tobu-Nikko Station (74 minute ride).  This portion of the journey cost JPY985 on my Suica Card.  I left Shinjuku Station at 8:19am and I got to Tobu-Nikko at 10:44am - So a total journey time of 2 hours 25 minutes with a total cost of JPY1,975.  All the train changes were easy and when to get to Tobu-Nikko Station simply exit at the main exit and walk straight ahead to the main road then turn right and walk about 25 minutes to Shinkyo Bridge and the entrance to the World Heritage Shrines.  To get back to Tokyo simply reverse the route.  I left Tobu-Nikko at 5:32pm and was back in Shinjuku for 8:15pm, so a 12 hour day but this gave me plenty of time to explore all of the Shrines and the Bridge.  Well worth the effort, not too expensive and an amazing cultural adventure.I recommend buying your tickets for the Shrines you want to visit at the ticket office located in the Tobu-Nikko Station.  This is far easier than fighting the long lines for tickets at the Shrines themselves.  I bought tickets for all the Shrines and by doing this you get 'combination' discounts.The Shrines themselves are beyond words, they are simply stunning and look great located in amongst the talk forest trees.  A very unique experience.  Do wear sensible shoes (trainers or walking shoes) as there is a fair bit of walking involved and some of it is up old steps.  Not much else to say other than ""Do Go"" and do look at my pictures as they speak 1000 words."
Amazing piece of history. Spectacular building and surrounds. Wear comfortable shoes that are easy to remove so you can enjoy the temple and other areas where shoes cannot be worn. The workmanship of these buildings is amazing. Had a bit of scaffolding and repair work happening while we were there but still great to see. Walking up the back to the shrine at top is steep so comfortable walking shoes would be the go.
"I would like to point out that after spending the day on this trip from Tokyo there is so much to see around Nikko and a 2-3 days would have been better. The train from Ueno to Utsunomiya then change for Nikko takes around 2hrs and is free with a J-R Railpass. Catching the World heritage bus from Nikko station 500 yen for loop hop on hop off bus,this has got to be the most impressive temple/shrine on the trip . Spread over a large area within the forest ,There are many levels to walk up and investigate some great Japanese history/culture , this is the resting place of one of the great Shoguns to unify Japan.The ornate buildings/shrines statues are wonderfully carved and guilded , i believe this temple gets really busy at weekends ,during the week was quieter. Its a must visit if your in the Nikko area,Don' forget the camera ,  not an easy climb on all levels there are quite a few steps , but there is plenty to see on the lower levels also ."
"There are a lot of shrines and temples in Japan but these are impressive and built in the mountains. I read that there are over 100 building at this temple complex.  I'm glad we decided to to stay there for 2 days because it takes a while to see most of it.  Saw lots of busses and train travelers on day trips probably from Tokyo, so you time is limited on those tours."
Wow . An amazingly beautiful place which was bigger than I expected. From the entrance through past the Yomeimon gate up the 270 steps to Leyasu’s treasure tower and ashes is beautiful. You visit the Sacred Fountain built in 1618 and the Pagoda . Look out for the sleeping cat carving. The shrine took two years to build and is the work of 15’000 artisans. It was a hot day when we visited and there were lots of tourists but it was still a pleasure to wander around. I must have taken at least 50 photos. I loved it all. After you visit take the left  road lined with lanterns to the Taiyuin -byn shrine which is just as impressive. It took us the whole morning to wander around these two shrines. Note this is not a good place for young children or people with mobility problems due to the number of steps.
"We did this as a day trip from Tokyo and enjoyed it. We’ve seen an awful lot of religious sites in our travels and can be a bit jaded . This one, however is up there. Well worth the train journey and the climb up seemingly endless steps. Do it all if you can . Maybe not the inside of the pagoda though. We didn’t. It seemed pointless. It’s beauty is on the outside."
"By far the best in Nikko! I guess when you’re one of the most famous leaders in Asian history- you get a good resting place. I have walked up a lot of stairs and seen a lot of old, famous, dead people’s resting place- this one is one of the best! Well kept and easy to navigate through. Don’t miss it!!"
"Toshogu shrine was a beautiful place with so much to see at every corner, you should allot few hours to fully appreciate it. We trekked up to the top of the shrine which is worth every step but you need to have strong legs to make the hike up and then down the steep steps. The ticket we purchased included a stop at the Crying Dragon. A must see!! We all enjoyed the wonder of that place. Recommend getting there early. We got there around 8:30am. By the time we left at 11am, it was packed!!"
"Clearly the top sight in Nikko. Try to go early to minimise the crowds. The museum next door is worth a visit, especially the video animation of the life of Toshugawa, with English sub-titles."
"Easily one of the most beautiful temples in Japan. We arrived in Nikko pretty early and were treated to fresh mountain air and the gorgeous site of this temple all to ourselves. It was early December and the light dusting of overnight snow contrasted with the dark browns, reds, and golds beautifully. Your experience would depend on the weather, of course, but if it is sunny like it was when I went, your eyes are definitely in for a treat. Elaborate decor and unbelievable calm."
This place is packed with tourist and travelers in the weekend. Be sure to come on a weekday instead.
"This can be a day tour from Tokyo. Train access to this site is very convenient. There is a direct train from Shinjuku to Nikko. If you miss it, there are plenty of options to transfer trains. The local bus to Toshogu runs every 15 min, a day bus ticket costs JPY500.   Recommend…"
"This shrine is a must see if you are interested in the history of Japan. Not only is the architecture magnificent (like every other temple and shrine in Japan), but also because it is the final resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu (although that appears to be a point of contention), one of the three unifiers of Japan. It was absolutely amazing being able to visit the shrine and I am very glad that I was able to witness it when I was in Japan. Be sure to watch the movie that is played in the nearby museum about Tokugawa Ieyasu, it is an extremely awe inspiring story about his life. The museum also holds some of Ieyasu's possessions which are magnificent to pore over. If you already know about the history of Japan you must come here to honour the legend that was Tokugawa Ieyasu."
"We travelled from Tokyo to Nikko. Took about 2 hours. Stopped at Nikko Train station. Purchased what the local call the “free buss pass” which is free once you purchase the bus pass. Bus pass Cost about 2000 yen each. This took us to the temple and then to Kegan Falls. You will need 8 hours to do Nikko and Fagan falls. Return pass to temple only was just about 300 yen and since the temple is up hill it’s well worth it. All I’ll say is, if you don’t make a trip to Nikko temples, you will be missing out in one of the most beautiful locations in the World. Get up early and go. Trust me on this one! As for Kegan Falls, that in another review."
"Quite large area, lots of steps, many beautiful buildings, colorful decorations. The walk from stations is not too strenuous, takes about 30 minutes. Frequent buses available, too. Read about it beforehand and you'll know what to look for."
"Went here with my fiancé and it was absolutely beautiful. Of course temples if you're into that, but nature itself is just breathtaking. Take a walk up the hill and enjoy the peace you won't find many places."
This place is absolutely stunning. The gold leaf rooves and the monks are so beautiful.  You get a great thigh workout for free if you climb all the way to the top.  It was pretty chilly in April fortunately that made the climb easier. I'd go back here again.  It's beautiful. Don't forget to pick up a charm or two.
"Incredible place to visit, lot of temple, beautiful details, lot of people, opened only until 5pm. Need at least 2hours to visit all the temple outside and inside"
