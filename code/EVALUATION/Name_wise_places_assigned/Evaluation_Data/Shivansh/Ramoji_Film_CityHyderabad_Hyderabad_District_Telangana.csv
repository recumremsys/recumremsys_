"I visited Ramoji film city 15 years back, At that time it was a great experince and recently I visited with my friends, this time I felt like I visited another world, What a drastic change in these yearsA huge campus, beautiful sets, good presentation of art of film making, audience involvement, the full entertainment package. Must watch for kids. Descent food choices. Be cautious with elderly as they lack sufficient wheel chairs, support, elderly friendly ramps. Carry sufficient water and be prepared for a good walk and good time"
"The film city is spread over huge place with lots of exciting stuff for all the people visiting it. Lovely ambiance with the parks, movie sets, bird sanctuary and many entertainment shows. Enjoyed throughout the day with family and friends. Best place to visit for those planning for a day out."
Have been to this place couple of times and it is always pleasure to be at Ramoji film city. Place is very relaxing looks like a magical kingdom. Must vist along with children to experience their amazing expression
"I have been to this Ramoji Film City several times with my family members, my niece, with cousins and friends. I enjoyed the trip every time that I had been here.You will find alot of movie sets and also realize or feel like you already saw them somewhere. Don't know if worry that must be in a movie.You will have bus roots inside and the buses are free. It is included in the entry fee of Film City.There will be many parks and star hotels and what not you will find all varieties of sets permanently laid.There are star hotels also available in the Film City called Tara and Sitara.The food is delicious in Ramoji Film City Canteen. Even though the food is a bit costly. It is delicious ðŸ˜‹."
We went there another couple. It is unbelievable place no one can rate it less then 5. If in Hyderabad should go. It's a whole day visit place. Try going after August. Or may be winters.
"Ramoji Film City is a film buff's fantasy come true. The property, located about 40 Km from Hyderabad, is spread over a whopping 1666 acres, with a large number of permanent sets, including a whole street of permanent double story residence houses for filming, plus sets where specific sets can be erected for TV serial or film shooting. It also includes play areas for children, carousel rides etc. Visitors are encouraged to spend the whole day indulging in their fantasies, children have a great run of wide open spaces, Disney Wonderland like rides, food outlets. It's a great idea for families to spend a day for the entertainment of the full family. There are plenty of restroom spread over the property, which are well maintained and clean. There are also live shows like how movies are made and Wild West. I believe that these shows are rotated regularly so that one could expect new shows regularly. Special buses ferry the visitors from the parking lots to the main attractions and there are well informed guides who are a wealth of information about the attraction. Some of the interesting attractions are the permanent BAHUBALI set with huge statues of horses, elephants, chariots and other sets used in the movie. Visitors are charged an Entrance Fee of around INR 1300 + VAT for the Economy tour. VIP Tour is around INR 2800 which includes all the aspects of the Economy tour but in a air-conditioned bus.If in Hyderabad, its worth a visit. Do free your itinerary for a full day visit"
"This was my 2nd trip to Ramoji Film City. However only this time I could see the whole place. We took their Hop on Hop off bus. Although the afternoon was hot in the open bus the heat was bearable. spread over 1,666 Acres this is the largest studio complex around the world as per Guinness Book of World  Records.They have created  quite a few attaractions that will hold inteerst fpr one whole day. The icing on the cake is the Set of the Blockbuster movie Baahubali which tehy have retained without demolishing the same & gives an idea how smart camera work can give larger tahn life feel to regular things."
"Located approximately 65 km away from hitec city ( traffic free ride thru ORR) is a fantasy land for Indian cinema.  U ought to reach parking area and take ramoji bus to the film city ( 6-8 km) the entry fee is 1250 per person for tour , food is not included but their restro have 4 options and seem reasonable if not crowded. Tho it's worth only 1 visit it surely fascinates in terms of some bird and butterfly park, bahubali sets, Rohit Shetty and other famous movie sets, they also show basic techniques and stunt shows. All in all its definitely a one time must visit day outing with all cultural parades etc, the only issue I feel was it's a maze once u enter u cannot skip, u ought to follow lane and see everything whether of your choice or no."
It is the biggest film city in India. Located in acres of areas. In summer season it is opens for tourists. We can see many buildings there which are made for movie shooting.and  many parks are here.
"We hv enjoyed lot. very nice experience we have. recommended to all. Ramoji Film City is the one of the biggest film city in the world, Plz go and must visit."
"A wonderful place and one I would suggest travellers to Hyderabad to visit. Take the AC Premium tour because it is definitely worth it. Our guide, Mr. Sathish Kumar, was truly wonderful."
An Amazing Landmark of Hyderabad. Created with Creativity and Care. Must Visit with Family and/or Friends.
"Ramoji Film City is spread across 2000 acres of land and needs at least 3 full days to visit all parts of it fully - in the words of the tour guide.We had booked the most expensive tour from the official website considering that we would be moved around in an AC bus in the heat (it was during May, and summer in Hyderabad in May can be brutal). It was a good decision as the few minutes in the bus gave respite from the heat and most of the entry tickets and our meals were taken care of.I am not sure if you can visit inside without an organized tour, but even if you can you would need to buy entry tickets at different places. Not to mention you might get lost driving on your own - No you cannot walk and visit the entire place!The film city has a few adventure rides and many film sets. There are some permanent sets that get painted and customized every time as per requirement - for example a railway station, the streets in Europe or mythological palaces. Then there are vast empty spaces where temporary sets are put up and removed, such as the Bahubali set which still stands owing to the interest in tourists. I guess it will be brought down only when they run out of space. There are restaurants, cafeterias and washrooms and drinking water are available at every few meters. There are many photo spots and also a few parks. You can also witness theater, multiple forms of dance, learn about film-making and witness a carnival in the late evening.The most commendable thing about the film city is the focus on an overall experience and keeping you engaged all day. You will definitely take back some good memories with you.Tip: Don't drive, they already have a lot to make you tired. Take their shuttle service to and from the city and opt for a guided tour inside."
"This place is unreal! Shows such a beautiful aspect of the movies we see in theatres! Very clean and well organized. The Baahubali set is love. Take care of food though, not many options once the internal tour starts."
"This place is superb! Shows such a beautiful aspect of the movies we see in theatres! Very clean and well organized. . Take care of food though, not many options once the internal tour starts.there are very picturesque tourist attractions."
"Had a great time here. Indian Universal Studio. Everything is nice here. Food, tour guide, location and activities inside. Complimentary given. Only don't go during summer. Bad choice."
if you are visiting this film city which is spread over 2600 acres then you need to ensure that you reach their well before 9:30 a.m. so as to cover the entire property. The ticket cost approximately rupees 1100 and includes few complementary shows and rights. At first they will drop you at the place where complementary shows are available you can watch all the shows here which are good.  after completing the shows the a lot of restaurants nearby and you can choose to have your lunch at one of this restaurant and then go on the film City tour where a bus and guide will be available. Post this they will drop you at the games area where complementary games will be available. I believe that summer and winter carnival which is the best time to visit these places and their accommodation inside the property as well. please note that you will not be allowed to visit any of the shooting locations where film shooting will be going on and if you want to watch the movie shooting then this is not the place to go.
"Ramoji film city is all about the movies, shooting spots and movie sets that include many popular hit movies. Even Bahubali set also can be viewed. Enjoyed the complete day. Inside the studio they provide vintage style buses to cover all the studio for free of cost( There is no fee for inside buses). There are many new things. Apartment style structures readylily avaialble for shootings. Village style set that has small houses. Foodcourt is good. The food is also good. There are two star hotels called Tara and Sitara. There is Airoplane and airport set, Railway station set with train and railway station. These are only things that you must not miss to visit."
well worth a day trip. Excellent management and setup for visitors. Had a lovely day out. The place is very well designed with good areas to visit
"We went here on a Sunday and entered late (almost 1pm). Saw some shows Filmi duniya (average), movie making (good), borasura (average), stunt show (average).Food we had at alampana which was good. Cons-1. If u have a kid who is less than 13 years then it's total waste of money as they can't enjoy most rides. Some rides allow kids above 5 years.2.The toilet is stinky and not maintained neatly. 3. The staff and the entertainment people are so exhausted that they don't respond well and act well. 4. If you go by 4 to the backlot tour, they will stop you and you can take pics. 5. Everyone have to exit by 6pm.6. You can't complete the whole tour at once,  you need to do twice. 7. You need to be there by 9 am to cover most of it. 8. The buildings are not really well maintained, they need to maintain it. Well do enjoy if you are going there."
Your kids will love it. Actually there is something for everyone. Its a huge huge park with unending activities. Do stay here for the show that happens late in the evening
"Visited in month of September and most interesting place ever, sahas activities are awesome. One day trip is best in hydrabad. Easy to book and coopretive sfaff good maintenance"
"We were in a group, kids, teens, adults. We enjoyed a lot. It has good restaurants to eat out n sit. Avoid to take 55+aged people with you or if anyone have physical health issues. Buses are available, but you have to get down , walk around and then board the bus at many places. It is very close experience with how films ate made."
"Nice memories at the film city. Except for the extreme heat of Hyderabad's noon time and the lack of good food arrangements there, there was nothing to complain. Enjoyed the nice shows and came back with good memories."
"It's must place to visit and enjoy the cinema different scenic places and you will get most of the views as you travel around the places (BUS to take tour) in the film city. Note, outside food not allowed."
"We visited Ramoji recently with some family friends on a Monday as reviews recommended avoiding the weekend crowds. Iâ€™ll break this review up into the approach, the experience of shows, dining & the return. The Approach. Booking tickets was a smooth affair from their website and we drove over in our own vehicle. From the moment we reached the approach roads we started getting impressed by the obvious structure & planning associated with the place. Good well paved roads, landscaping, direction pointers & security at regular intervals to provide any guidance. On reaching the entrance (~10:45am) we were directed towards an ample parking area space. Hopped across and picked up our tickets from the dedicated internet booking ticket queue at their well marked ticket center and were directed to the transport area. A quick walk (really just across the road took us to the entry area where we waited in Q for ~5min before going through a standard movie theatre style security check then thru the turnstiles (8x to manage the crowds). The waiting area for the buses that take you to the actual park had a short dance program going in to get us in the mood, good clean toilets a couple of small kiosks for caps, souvenirs etc. We were soon ushered into well maintained buses that drove us into the actual park. This I guess helps Ramoji ensure crowd control and keeps all the traffic away from the actual park. Smooth!!Coming soon ... the experience...."
What a place Ramoji Film city. No words to describe the experience. Amazing...Some tips that will improve your experience.1. We booked a Ramoji Bus to pick up & drop from Hyderabad.2. Reach there by 9:15 am. Their welcome ceremony starts around 9:30 and dont miss.3. Enjoy your shows till 1:00 pm and tried to attend maximum. Every show is wonderful.4. Around 01:30 their bus trip will start.5. Dont carry extra water with your self. Facility of drinking water is very easily accessible every where.6. Outside Food and Snacks are not allowed but their canteen is there with reasonable price.Very good management.
"Very nice historical place, feeling good to see this place, this very place and very natual. Feeling awasom"
"Ramoji film city provides an unique experience for its visitors and is a must see @ Hyderabad. About an hourâ€™s drive from city, itâ€™s spread over 2000 acres and includes live studio floors and many sets/ locales/ shows for visitors. I recommend doing the VIP / Privilege tour to do justice to the spread on view in a day. This will start @ their VIP lounge, AC bus guided tour and yummy lunch and reduced walk and priority view for their shows - double the regular price, but worth it given the great experience and the effective and optimized itinerary. The Bahubali set property is the highlight. Unlike Universal studios ( and for better) you get to see mostly â€˜ behind the scenes â€˜ experiences. There is a separate paid enclosure for adrenaline activity. Be there @ 9 am to view the inaugural welcome show. During winters, there is also a closing parade on offer."
Claimed as a largest film city complex in the world. Worth spending time. We took Day Tour normal package. Very well maintained complex with good number of support staffs who guides and helps at every moment. Very spacious food courts with good options and reasonably priced. Space Yatra is not good. Kids rides are fine. Overall excellent place to visit
"The most mesmerising set I came across within this entire filmy city is the set of Mahabharata. it was like the same backdrops that I used to watch on the TV in my childhood. Takes a whole day to cover the entire place and it is worth visiting. if I am not wrong then it is the largest film city in Asia, so something to brag about as well for us."
"This is must place to visit. Route is so designed by management that you never get bored. visit to sets, parks, adventure zone, shows and carnival all were amazing. if you have to enjoy full city you need two days. Management should also issue combo tickets for two day which make Ramoji Film city even more attractive. Note staying inside Ramoji  Film city hotel is advisable"
"Very nice and awesome layout. Clean air, good roads, greenary and trees and well maintained gardens and artistic parks. Some big tall trees give fragrances which is wonderful. Nice replicas of other overseas cities. Good conventional halls and airport replicas. Transport is an issue. Have to stick to the tour bus. Overall great."
"Most other reviews might have talked about all the attractions and great things that are there in the Film-city so I do not want to emphasis the grandeur or beauty of the place. Its very well maintained and nicely decorated. As I visited with family including two young kids I will rather explain few things that should know before you plan. The film-city tour done by red-bus is not like you sit in the bus and it goes every place. Instead one bus drops you at one location, you see it and move to next pickup point and catch another bus. During weekends and festival time due to crowd it may become bit tiring to run around here and there for the bus. Remember even though there is bus tour you need to walk atleast 6-7 km still and in hot weather of Hy'bad its very exhausting. People having trouble in walking, be careful one day completion goal wil bring your heart inside your mouth. For Jain followers like me, there is good amount of jain food available. There are many restaurants inside but I somehow felt food was pretty avg in quality and not lot many options were there. Photo clicks and prints are quite costly (as its on all tourist desti) better to carry your own camera. If you are planning a trip with family, plan on carnival timmings as it wil remain open till 8PM and lightings done in the evening willl blow your mind. For kids dont miss the UV light show and wild-west live stunt show. Opening and Closing ceremonies are great. Carnival parade is something you might not see anywhere in India. Ample food, water and rest-rooms all over the place. You dont have to struggle for any directions as they keep announcing where to go next or what show will start soon. Lot of help staff is spread across the 1666 acrs of land to guide you correclty."
