"Nice walk through the zoo and very more options to watch..Few spieces of animals will not be found in other zoo are available here...loved the black leopard. seems like my pet ""Augosto"""
"Kids can enjoy watching animals.  Need an hour time to see all animals.   Not much of walking required, best picnic spot."
Good place to visit with kids. Mountaineering enthusiast would love the HMI museum inside the zoo. The place also offers great view of Darjeeling town.
A must visit place for iconic museums and HMA . Offers nice activities n great deal of knowledge for young children.
"Interesting place! Was excited to see a Snow Leopard & a Bengal Tiger for the first time (of which there is one of each), although it kills me to see these amazing creatures in captivity. Good selection of animals who look good so it seems they are looked after.The one annoying thing about the zoo is the staff set at dedicated points holding up signs saying 'Silence', yet everyone around them was running around screaming, taking selfies etc. Not really sure what the purpose of these staff's job is, of everyone is just ignoring them? Some discipline would help this zoo a lot. Same goes for forcing people to dispose of their waste properly."
"The zoo was a great place to visit! Such amazingly is the place maintained with such a variety of animals, it is really worthwhile to spend time in here. The animals are distinctively organized and placed according to their types, e.g. herbivore, birds, reptiles etc. The place is clean, and is full of greens that is sure to soothe the eye. There is also a museum which is another attraction inside the zoo. Walking can cause a bit tiredness since the area is vast, but it's alright when one is visiting such a beautiful place!"
"This is a must visit place for families with children. The park closes by 5.30 - do plan to reach by a maximum 3 pm to make the best of the place. Patience really pays well, as there is only 1 Red Panda. There are few animals which one can see only here. The museum's and Himalayan institte can be given a skip - depends on ones personal interest. The zoo does have a canteen with options for light snack. Ensure you ask the driver to leave you at the ticket entrance (vehicles are permitted), else you would have to walk quiet a bit. From the City sharing taxi is also available at Rs 10 per person, who would not drop you till the top."
Well maintained zoo...much cleaner than Alipore Zoo. Has a good collection of predatory big cats! Loved the close encounter with the Royal Bengal Tiger...
"Better than Kolkata Zoo. Moreover, if the weather is fine you'll enjoy walking through the place. Recommended."
"Visited this zoo during June during our stay in Darjeeling. Need to walk steep road, however the collection of animals are good. may not be recommended for aged people as it will be a tiresome one."
"This place has three points all inside the same.When you enter the park you will see animals and later you have Himalyan mountaineering institute , and Bengal natural history museum. All are worth watching. Walking there is a bit tiring but rest all is good."
"Visited this place with two Young kids and along with them, we loved watching all animals. The key attractions were red panda and black panther. Wolfs were in good numbers as well. Recommend this place to visit specially travelling with kids and if u r a nature lover urself."
Often read about the animals peculiar to the Himalayas. Absolutely fascinating to actually view them in real time and not on a nature programme. First ever views of a Snow Leopard and Cloud Leopard. Made the visit so worthwhile!
"Not all animal sitting in the cages, for those which are - good space to walk around. well maintained, green area with the nature museum. Was a bit shocked to see the animal mummies and heads in, but the keeper explained that the collection was from the time of British colonial…"
Really nice Zoo and well maintained. Spotting Red Panda was really nice. Nice place to hang out with Kids.
My family enjoyed this place. We spend couple of hours here. Go place to explore Himalaya related stuff
Zoological park in near natural habitat. requires more maintenance. Animals looks bored.still several animals are there including Bengal tiger.
Amazing zoo with a museum.Great view of animals.Treat to see bengal tiger and red panda.Very neat and clean. Had a great experience.ver well maintained.
"This zoo is full of sad animals kept in solitary confinement.  It's ok for an Indian zoo and, no doubt, the animals are well cared for generally - but you might find it depressing.  Not much to do in Darjeeling so you'll probably end up here anyway. Be prepared..."
"We could see lots of rare birds. But since are kept inside glass cover, it's very difficult to take photos. It also hosts several red panda including few young ones. Enjoyed it thoroughly."
"Visited as part of a tour of attractions in and around Darjeeling.Small zoo with quite a few empty enclosures. Most of the animals were kept in small cages.Steep climb; can be difficult for elderly and physically challenged.Had a few big cats -- jaguar, royal bengal tiger, etc -- and a very small aviary. The main attraction was the red panda.The zoo appeared to be clean and well maintained.Overall: Small zoo with limited number of animals. You won't miss much if you skip it but, perhaps, worth a visit if you have small children."
"Great joy to see the zoo despite little time. Snow leopard, beer, tiger etc. Are main attraction. Mountaineering institute is worth to see"
A nice clean zoo with a good range of animals. Liked the visit as a family. Probably one of the best places to visit in Darjeeling which is unsatisfactory as a place.
Went there with friends.spend around 1.5 hours in zoo & HMI together.Snow leopard Royal bengal tiger Himalayan fox are some of the animals which we have not seen earlier. So for us it was a nice experience. Also there's a shop near HMI where you can click photos with traditional dresses on rent. Tickets are 60/ person for both zoo & HMI together.
"Visiting this place was on my priority becuase at this plac only i got a chance to view the rare wildlife of Himalayas. Other zoo’s in India do not have this wildlife due to the climatic conditions they require. This is the place where i foundf the high altitude amazing Himalayan animals and some endangered species that are rarely seen anywhere else in the world. In India, this is the largest high altitude zoo. Got a chance to see Red Panda, Snow Leopard, Cloud Leopard,Blue Sheep, Barking Deer, Himalayan Wolf etc."
"A very small sized zoo that's been made to cater for the Himalayan specific fauna of the region. So run into Antelopes, tigers, leopards and most famous Red Panda, which are by the way, too cute. The entry fee is very nominal and they have restrooms and tea stalls inside. Do visit the HMI and the museums inside during the tour. Best place to bring kids."
Enjoyed the nature's park!! The red panda is a must see. They even have the snow leapord which is a very rare species.
"(Seo 2014) Well, we can all criticize zoos as animals are kept inside cages there. But this was special especially many ""enclosures"". The variety of animals is huge. Saw many animals for the first time there. Red panda and clouded leopard to name a few."
"Need not to spend too many words to describe a short yet refreshing day trip to #Darjeeling town. At our leisurely pace, we strolled on the curved steep roads leading to Mall, visited the Himalayan Zoological Park, had sumptuous lunch at Glenary's and had some tea tasting sessions before calling it a day."
"Mountaineering institute in middle of zoo,all geography,mountains in the area,people who explored, equipment carried definitely good knowledge arena how people struggle.The zoo has many species of birds,reptiles n Royal Bengal tiger.its delight to spend time here. Very gud for families,kids even couples."
"We visited the Darjeeling zoological gardens and were extremely impressed with the natural styled animal enclosures and amazing views. Having visited Kolkata zoo earlier in our trip, this zoo was much much much better. The highlight was feeding time for the red pandas, just before 4pm which resulted in lots of activity and close up photos! The black panther and snow leopards were also a highlight."
"Very well structured infrastructure; wild animals kept sequentially.   I read reviews which said public transport in form of dedicated shared carts can be availed to the site, I hunted around and discovered as of August 2019 it has been discontinued.A cab from hotel can be booked or if you can find the way around, you can be guided by locals how to avail the shared local transport. This enroute to other places will drop at the site. The local transport it cheap but it just drops to the foot of the uphill zoo and a walk with small kids could be detrimental. A booked cab will cost more but waits for the slotted time. 'Pessimists' wrote reviews of ill conditions animals were kept in ...caged, not fed properly etc. One even said the animals looked sad ...hahahaha as if the visitors were expert reading animal emotions. And my question to them ..why did you visit in the first place then ? Or were you expecting wild animals to roam around arms in arms with humans in a zoo. Certainly it is not the size of what one would see in an international zoo but short and sweet place to visit. And they certainly are not kept in inhuman conditions, they are well fed and breeding also takes place to ensure continuity.My kids really enjoyed and it was quiet informative as well. I'm told the Gangtok zoo is better ...maybe next time...as for this we did not have any complaints.   Kids !! Don't forget to collect your postcards depicting the animals at the entrance after the visit."
Worth a watch. Greenary. Preserved and maintained really well. You have an option to do indoor mountaineering at just 30rs per head. Museum and shows are a bit time consuming.
"We were lucky to get a good look at all the animals. Seeing up close the snow leopard, Royal Bengal Tiger, black panther, asian bears and red panda is exhilarating. You should take sufficient time to visit this place and avoid timings between 1 and 2pm because most animals would take naps then. 100% MUST VISIT!!"
Nothing special seen lot of better zoos then this one. Poor Bengal Tiger look in disgusted stat. Felt sorry for him. Only nice thing was the way it was built on a slopes.
