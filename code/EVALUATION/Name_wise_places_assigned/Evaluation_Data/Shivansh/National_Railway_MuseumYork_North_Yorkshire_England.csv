"Been many times, great museum and free. Can give donations if you wish. I went especially to see  the rocket exhibition. A little disappointing considering the hype. The  original rocket was positioned in a very non photogenic position with the chimney early touching the heating pipes of the museum. There were far better places to put it."
"The place is free but a donation is optional.Very interesting place to go if you love trains new and old. It even shows you how they work, how to send signals and even showed some people building the trains. Very interesting and informative. Loved seeing the shows and it's great for all ages.  ðŸ˜ŠI thought it would be boring but actually I really really enjoyed it!"
"Staying in York for a few days and managed to book tickets online after website kept saying none available. The approach on foot to the museum is through a grotty tunnel smelling of wee with broken glass not a  very pleasant start. Once arrived at the museum in our dedicated time slot we were shown in quickly. We decided to try to get something to eat first so went to cafe in the great hall, 2 sandwiches and 2 cans of coke nearby Â£15 No Way!! we put it back and decided not to eat.  Shame reasonably priced food would sell well, when I questioned price I was told well the museum is free, not the point.Inside is an interesting collection but the great hall I didn't feel was that great it's missing something and felt a little worn out and dated. The rocket is an example as it's kind of stuffed in a side room surrounded by white walls that really to show it to it's full glory, wasted opportunity could be a really fantastic display with a bit more thought and input. Glad I've seen it but wouldn't rush back."
Went on Sunday so loads of out of control kids running around however there is loads to see.  Itâ€™s free entry just encourage a donation to help maintaining and expanding the stock.   There are refreshments and a shop.  Plenty of toilets.  A lot of the display is undercover so would be a good visit if the weather wasnâ€™t very good.
"Visited here during a 3 day break to York.Some really interesting exhibits on show. Love the fact they have all types of engine and carriage on show and I thought the layout was well thought out especially during these strange times (Covid).I like the idea of pre booking as I can imagine during normal times it can get quite busy and very noisy with the children running around.One slight downside is the price of food but I suppose when the entrance fee is free they need to make their money somehow so I don't begrudge this too much, plus you don't have to buy it!"
"Was really surprised at how interesting and vast this museum was! Amazing value given that it was free, and even with some of the exhibits shut due to covid, we managed to spend over an hour and a half there. Well worth a visit even if you normally have zero interest in trains like me!"
"Excellent museum with free entry although it helps a lot if you make a donation - Â£5 suggested.  Well worth it to keep this place running!Anyone who loves railways can easily spend 3 hours here.  Make a point of visiting the Collections Store and look out for the sign to Platform 9 3/4.Unfortunately, the visit was marred (slightly) by the Station Hall cafe which was disappointing.  For the price charged, I was expecting to get a decent sandwich but mine was dry with little filling and nearly inedible.  I'm sure they could do better.  The one in the Great Hall may be better?"
"We took our 2 Autistic Grandchildren to visit this museum, been a few years since our last visit and they enjoyed it then.They absolutely loved the place, buzzing with lots of old engines, trains, accessories and really interesting place to visit. Spent at least 3 hours here and they even wanted to go on the train simulator which they said was really good.A good day had by all and very interesting and educational saw parts of the museum we had missed on our last visit a few years back the place is lovely and the staff very obliging and friendly - would highly recommend for young and old alike"
"Completely disappointed .We travelled for 2 hours, paid Â£10 to park the site to find our total visit was 40 minutes because the majority of exhibits and halls aren't yet open. Would have been nice to have been informed at time of booking. The day has cost us a fortune for nothing.  Save your money!!!"
"Am amazed that this place is free,so much to see . From a woman's point of view i thought it would be a bit boring but not a bit of it was. The Japanese bullet train was a revelation and lots of steam trains but my very favourite trains was the ones with the royal carriages , wow luxury indeed."
A free attraction to visit with the whole family. On site cafe a little pricey but great styling with carriage style seating. Allow for plenty of time to get around everything!
My husband enjoys mechanical things so our visit to York by steam train was a fore gone conclusion that we would visit the National Railway Museum which is FREE to enter and relies on public donations.What an amazing Collection of trains through the ages you could spend hours in there and still not cover everything.Lots of the trains you could view the interior some you could stand on the foot plate - every childâ€™s dream! The were a couple of cafes serving drinks and snacks. The toilets were clean. There was a shop selling memorabilia. Signing from the station maybe there but we missed any and had to ask a couple of times and seemed to walk round in circles. Better signing would certainly help especially from York Station.
Brilliant place you can actually get lost in the heritage. Loved the bullet train set up. The informational vids were brilliant. And great for the grandchildren!!
"Visited with 5 yr old grandson and despite him not really being interested in trains, he spent a couple of hours looking around, climbing on board the exhibits and learning about how transport has changed over the years. Lots to see and well presented. Entrance is FREE with a suggested donation of Â£5 which is well worth it."
Used to come as a child many times and hasn't lost its magic even as a 25 year old. Wish everything could be open but obviously I know why it isn't - still a great hour to be had wandering around looking at the amazing exhibits. My favourite is the bullet train and now I can take it everywhere with me as I bought a pin badge of it to the bewilderment/amazement of my boyfriend from the gift shop! Thank you for this lovely museum!
Took 4 year old here. He loved it as did we all. Highly recommend. Also took tractor train back to york minster which was Â£3 per adult for one way.Close to york station and good viewing platform within museum to watch station.
"Absolutely fantastic spent 2 and half hours in this amazing place. Packed with history, big thumbs up"
We had a lovely day out here exploring. We got to go inside a few of the trains they had opened up. The wonderful Emily gave us the history behind the engines once inside. We rode on the little train which fun. We had great day learning about the history of British trains and railways. Had a lovely afternoon tea whilst there
We all had a Fantastic day and my partner did the cream tea whilst there and that was superb as well. Took my elderly mum and dad and mum was in a wheel chair and my twin sons for a birthday treat.
"Went with family including 2 children.  Attended a demonstaion of the science of steam travel which was great fun.  The ""explainer"" was brilliant and the kids loved it (including one 6 going on 13 year old boy)"
"Not bad at all. Booked tickets for a half hour entry slot, very efficient entry system in place. As tickets were limited, there was plenty if space to see the exhibits, without lots of people crowding around. Very well set out inside, my only issue was that there was very little information about each train on display."
A great place for families especially small boys or grown men. Take your own food there are plenty places to eat them or the cafe is available eating on the platform amongst the trains. Indoor and outdoor activities so great whatever the weather
Free entry is always a bonus with a young family. Bring a picnic or try the train cafe/restaurant. Reasonable prices for quality food. Lovely outdoor area for kids to play or to picnic. Lockers available so no need to carry all your stuff with you all day. Really interesting and fun for the whole family. No need to be into trains to enjoy here.
We spent an amazing day here. Had a bite to eat which was a slightly confusing set up but a nice setting. Free to get in with optional donation. We definitely recommend you donate this is a fabulous day out. Thank you so much for an informative packed aw inspiring day.
Had a lovely trip to the National Railway museum. There is so much information about the trains and the history of the trains in the museum. So much can be learnt here and the staff on reception and around the museum and so lovely and always ready to answer any questions that you may have. This is fantastic place for people who have an interest in history and trains!
"Cannot believe how great this museum was! Even my wife who is not in to trains said how brilliant it was.Even with car parking Â£10 for the whole day, worth going too as FREE to get in, wow.The minute you walk in you are greeted by friendly helpful staff, and itâ€™s like this all over, every one helpful and happy and enjoying their work.I expected ropes around the trains, not one you can get up close to all. Including the great  Mallard, even stood on the footplate. One down note, all your friends will walk away as you cannot stop talking about it."
The national railway museum is brilliant and being free is good. There collection of locomotives and coaches is great and all in amazing condition. Being able to get on to some of the trains is really good. The shop is very good. The main restaurant has a very good menu and good prices.
"The museum is large and plenty to see. Very interesting and there is a cafe on site. There is no charge for visiting. Brings back lots of memories with the old trains ""Intercity"" etc."
I went here a few months back and well i was really surprised that i enjoyed this place. trains arenâ€™t really my thing but when i went to give my grandad a look at how things were when he was young i enjoyed it as much as he did. he loved telling me and showing me where he sat and where he worked. it was amazing for all of us. getting to see such brilliant and beautiful trains was a great day out and well worth the visit. thank you for making my grandad able to revisit how it used to be for him and thank you for making the rest of my family have a really enjoyable day out!
"Enjoyable couple of hours here, plenty to see, we came in out of rain and glad we did. Brought back nice memories"
"Visited this site back in September 2019 with my sister who is a train nerd. She thoroughly enjoyed her visit, particularly seeing the Mallard and we were both fascinated to see a portion of the Eurotunnel. The museum is very large and many hours can be spent exploring the various warehouses. There are talks and presentations throughout the day, I particularly enjoyed the turntable talk (however couldn't help but cringe at the amount of children sticking their hands out after the tour guide specifically stated all limbs should be kept far away. Please parents, watch your children during the talk for their safety!)My sister enjoyed the upstairs balcony, which provides a viewing platform for York station - she was able to tick off each train as it came in and out. Great wee bonus for the train fans.As one of the very few (if not only?) free attractions in York, I highly recommend spending some of your time here. It's a less than 45 minute walk from the city centre (maybe even 30), and it's very easy to find.Staff were also very knowledgeable too - my sister quizzed two men about some of the exhibits and they were able to keep up with her no issue."
Decided to have a stroll down memory lane. As a pensioner this can be a completely free day out as the travel by bus and the museum are totally free. Short walk from the bus drop off point at York railway station to the museum down Leeman Road. Didnâ€™t plan it but struck lucky when there was a guided talk and tour of the Royal Carriages soon after I arrived and the young lady Helen was extremely enthusiastic and knowledgable. Some of the exhibits you can actually enter but most are cordoned off. I would have liked to have access to at least one footplate but I never found one. Thousands of artefacts As well as the locomotives themselves. The display locomotives are immaculate and when you visit the repair shops you see how much work goes into restoring them. Also plenty of activities for the younger end to keep them amused. Intercity 125 is already a museum pieceðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ donation boxes dotted about the building suggesting a deposit of a fiver which I didnâ€™t think was unreasonable for such a wonderful experience
I have not been to york in many many years but decided to visit this museum and local model shops. I was very pleased with both! Sadly the covid restrictions made it not as enjoyable as it should have been but I knew that going in and can't fault the museum or staff at all. Thank you - John
We had been told by several friends that we must visit the national railway museum. We booked a slot (free entry) and didn't wait long before going in. Due to covid-19 it's marked out for social distancing although at times it's hard because of other people visiting. We presume you can usually go in some of the trains but they were closed off. There were a few parts closed off and only one cafe open. Even if you are not a train enthusiast you would love this. No steam train ride or mini railway operating. Need to go again sometime
"This museum is brilliant I really loved looking through the windows of the royal trains, amazing to see where queen victoria sat on her trips to Scotland. The luxury she and prince Albert put into all the carriages was incredible.So much to see in the two big halls of trains. Including a replica of Stephensonâ€™s rocket and so much more."
