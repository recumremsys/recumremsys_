"Krasnaya Street runs through the centre of Krasnodar.The night views of lit up buildings, The Aurora theatre and fountain show are spectacular. The walk from the Aurora to the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral takes about three hours with many interesting and unusual buildings and monuments to see. There are numerous cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. The street is extremely cultured and safe. Try and visit the Kuban Cossack Theatre-there was a school choir performing during a Russian Orthodox event when I visited. Extremely touching. Well done to the people of Krasnodar for designing such a terrific thoroughfare."
Walking through Krasnai street is relaxible  and affected with sculptures. Especially night time is so nice watching water show with music. I like it.
Krasnaya street is the main street in krasnodar. Very long . It finishes by monument of Catherine 2. Not really interesting but u can enjoy walking there during summer Â´s weekends ( road is closed for cars) . Has many bars and restaurants
