"Then we drove to the second stop of the day: Nasu Animal Kingdom 那須動物王國. It is famous for having many animal shows, including Bird Performance Show, Cat Show, New Zealand Farm Show, and Aqua Friends. There are also areas where visitors can interact with animals closely, such as Capybara Forest, Alpaca Hill, Tropical Rainforest. We had a good time in the park, with the opportunity to interact with the animals, many we had not seen before let alone be in such close proximity. During the visit, one can also experience the nice ambiance of the Nasu Highland. Approaching noon we decided to have lunch at the Yamaneko Terrace, going for a soy sauce ramen while enjoying the gorgeous view in the backdrop."
"Quite a nice pet zoo. Don't have wild animals like lion , tiger or elephant . Children can pet or touch animals. Show performance are nice . Entrance fee are expensive. We get half price discount as we show them Gondora ticket ( cable car - limited time discount promotion) . Suggest you buy ticket together w barbecue buffet . Restaurant food very small portion and expensive. Barbecue buffet is more worth . It's located in mountain . Very nice autumn leave view in early of November ."
"I visited here over a year ago. You have chances to pet lots of animals, and even hold a lion cub! I also got to see a baby wallaby which has appeared in television several times.Other than that, I felt sorry for the dogs that you get to pet. They all look so tired, and bored. You have a chance to walk them, for a price, around the whole park. Adorable, but their furs were greasy and dirty, I felt terribly sad for them... It's very loud around there and the dogs hardly get any peace and quiet. If you're lucky, you'll get to see staff walking an alpaca and get a change to pet it!There's also a 'cat house' thing with lots of cats. of course, inside a spacious building. Lots of equipment and apparatus for the cats and lots of space for them to roam in. Many of them, however wanted space away from people.The cable car which leads you down to the other half of the park, where you will see more farm/desert mammals, like horses, camels, kangaroos, sheep...etc. was a nice trip. Nice views as you go down with the cable car, however, it's quite dangerous, as there's no belts and it's quite steep. I took several pictures of the animals and they're very inactive, and quite sad looking."
