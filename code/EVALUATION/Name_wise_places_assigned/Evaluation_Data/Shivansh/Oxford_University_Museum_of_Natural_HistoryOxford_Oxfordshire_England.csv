"It was the reason for my visit, but there is so much more to see here. They have a fabulous T Rex skeleton , interesting interactive exhibits- and a great cafe. Allow at least 2 hours."
Had an absolute blast here with my 2 children. There are lots of activities and a lovely cafe. The dinosaur section was our favourite. It doesn't cost anything to get into the museum but we have a donation as we had such a good day!
This is one of my favourite places to visit in Oxford. Filled with wonderful curiosities and you can easily dedicate a day to wonder at the Pitt-Rivers collection. The natural history museum has excellent information and a great lay-out. Make sure to go past the cafe and have a look at the bee-hive. It’s my favourite feature.
"Wow, what a place, so much to see. Having visited the Natural History museum in London, which I didn't rate, I was expecting this one to be worse, but was very surprised. We spent nearly 4 hours here and will definately be back."
This and the Pitt Rivers museum that is attached to it are well worth a visit. Spend a few hours wandering around the amazing displays. Gets busy in school holidays but still a memorable day.
"While some of the displays are older, the collections of exhibits is outstanding.  Check out the dodo and look for a kakapo."
Been here more for events that were hosted in the museum than to view the collection. It is a beautiful setting!
Spent about an hour here. Great collection with exhibits that you are allowed to touch. Very interactive and is great for kids with various materials to keep them engaged. All displays were well labelled and detailed. Saw the famous remnants of a Dodo. Would come back for a fuller visit.
This is a small museum. Basically one large room stuffed full of natural history artifact. Great for children of all ages. Lots to see. Has activities for children. My grandson loved the dinosaurs especially the head of the t-Rex.
Interesting and enjoyable visit.  Have visited the Londong NHM and although the Oxford museum is smaller it was well laid out and plenty of exhibits.  Would recommend.
For those fascinated by the time when dinosaurs walked the earth this is a must see.  Children in particular will love seeing the models and exhibits as it brings the whole time to life.  Imagine the film Night at the Museum and that’s what it’s like.  The glass architecture of the building is absolutely amazing.  It leads through to the Pitt Rivers Museum which has a dark creepy feel with exhibits such as shrunken heads.  This part of the museum is a little challenging for the mobility scooter but it is possible to negotiate your way around some of it.
"Popped in with the family on the way south. We enjoyed looking at all the dinosaur skeletons and fossils, and marveling at the size of the creatures. Plenty to see, and we liked the fact you could stroke the bears! Went to the Pitt Rivers museum (inside the NHM) to see the shrunken heads as well - gruesome!"
One of the best museums I have visited. Well displayed with the right level of details. Have enjoyed the information about bacteria and virus.
The exhibition is quite interesting but you probably won't send more than 20 minutes there. Mostly stuffed animals. Loved the sceletons though :)
"The Natural History Museum is a must-see in Oxford for children of all ages. It has a lovely welcoming interior, and, along with the excellent Pitt Rivers Museum in the back corner of the building, you could easily entertain yourself (and your children, if you have any) for several hours on a rainy day quite happily. It has wonderful and fascinating exhibits, and is right next to University Parks--a nice place for stroll or a picnic in good weather. If the weather is not terrific, there is a reasonably-priced cafe on the first or second floor--  and more exhibits on the upper floors of the museum worth seeing as well. Have spent countless happy hours here with my children, we all love it dearly."
Very interesting and informative.  Range of all things nature and how we began.  Live displays as well
"We visited Oxford for one day and spotted also this museum. Although not very big (very suitable actually for common layman) we enjoyed the facilities, many many items and nice layout of all exhibits. Easy access and a lot to see. Recommend."
A wide range of curios and historical artefacts on display. Make sure you also go through to the Pitt Rivers museum at the back.
"The building itself is fascinating and stunning in its design inside. Very light and bright. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice cafe upstairs and you can walk straight through to The Pitts Museum. Don’t miss either if you are visiting Oxford, they are wonderful."
Had some time to spare so decided to have a quick look and ended up staying for ages! Great museum with so much to see and free entry! Lots of different areas so something for everyone. Recommend to people of all ages if visiting Oxford.
"Visited along with the Pitt Rivers Museum which is adjoining. Airy and spacious the museum manages to make geology interesting (even for me) and, in addition to the dinosaur skeletons, there are large displays of British Birds. Popular with parties of young school children who, as well being extremely well behaved, all seemed to be hugely interested in all the exhibits. Worth a visit."
We went as four adults and six children. The children loved their time at the museum. Touching the big fur brown bear. Looking at the skeleton of the different anomaly but especially the dinosaurs. They enjoyed watching the real bees. Were amazed by the dinosaur footprints outside the museum. There was an Easter egg hunt. But as under 4s they lost interest in quiz.
"As you can see from the overall ratings, you are onto a good thing visiting Oxford University's Museum of  Natural History. I just thought I would share some tips and information to help out others. I have three children (6 and under) so finding things to entertain them in the school holidays is hard work, and wallet draining at times. I don't know about other families but we have to break up the home craft / baking, park visits and scooter/walks with other adventures. Que the natural history museum which is the perfect size for my three to enjoy, and for us to cover a day out. We live about 25 minutes outside of Oxford, so drove to the nearest park and ride: Oxford Parkway (previously Water eaton). It costs £2 to park for up to 11 hours, and £4.80 return for a family (2 adults and up to 3 children (under 16)). If you need a buggy, take your collapsible/quick fold (there is a luggage shelf to put it on) because the buses only have two spaces and one of the spaces is used as additional seating so if those are filled up you are down to one space. When I got on there was already a lady parking in that spot. The museum is free, but they do have boxes where you can drop in some money to help fund this fantastic set up. There is plenty to do and see, and my boys really loved it when a sign said 'PLEASE TOUCH' (ie getting to stroke an American brown bear). My 1 yr old who has been walking about a month, also LOVED the museum. She happily explored and squealed with delight when she was able to touch or get up close to something. The upstairs has themes that are changed throughout the year (its bacteria at the moment, and there are lots of interactive activities for the kids to engage). We also loved seeing a working bee hive, and of course the dinosaur skeletons (there are foot prints in the grass outside). There is a cafe upstairs but I packed a picnic (as did a lot of families), and we ate outside (thankfully it was a sunny day) where there are a couple benches but if you have space for a picnic blanket in your buggy basket (or backpack) then take it with you.  Tips: * At Oxford parkway, you you can park there for up to 72 hours.* There are two ticket machines, one for those who just want to pay for the parking (as you might be catching the train, or have a bus pass / annual ticket) and the other is for those buying a combined ticket. * Don't lose your ticket, as it is your return ticket. * There is a heated waiting area with clean toilets. Its worth using them if you have little ones because once in Oxford finding clean, accessible toilets gets a little harder. But look for a M&S, shopping centre ... or hold on til you get to the museum.* When you get off from the bus the museum is about a 10 minute walk, and there are no food outlets nearby except for the cafe located up stairs."
"Had to follow the signposts but well worth the walk. Very well laid out with detailed explanations of exhibits. Can walk through to the Pitt Rivers Museum.Has a cafe on first floor, nice food"
Have visited twice now as there’s always a good exhibition on and lots to do. Beautiful place with a good atmosphere
Very interesting and as good as the London Natural History museum. I particularly liked the dinosaurs and crystal formations. Combine your visit with the Pitts River Museum as just next door.
Called in to see the new exhibition on bacteria and it was amazing - lots of information that I didn't know before. It has awakend my interest to find out more
"Go see, it's a bit of everything and is a delight for people who don't want to be spoon fed an interactive experience but look and read and learn. Don't open the witches bottle...."
"Very friendly and helpful staff at the entrance. Geared up for younger visitors and I was pleased to see more exhibits now which can be touched which is great for getting children into science. I love the black bear and the brown bear which you can touch. There is also an Ammonite and some Pyrites and other tactile exhibits which is great for visually impaired visitors. The building itself is very interesting architecturally. Free entry. A great museum, with a good shop, as a starter for young children. They will fill up your water bottle free too."
The museum isn’t huge (and we weren’t sure about Pitt Rivers that the museum runs straight into) but is well worth an hour - has loads of skeletons / models and we really liked the highlighting of gifted women through history who had been involved in science and in the main hadn’t been able to get the qualifications they’d been entitled to. Is free for entry - they just ask for donations.
"Having visited one before, I recommended that my friend visit when we went - and the dinosaurs, gems, fossils and displays remain excellent and breath-taking (and full of small children, because this is a very good alternative to slogging into London!) Lots of interesting exhibitions (eg we stumbled upon the wood one upstairs, and some beetles...)My only niggle is the cafe - the food is fine, but the attitude of the staff is poor; perfectly polite when serving but no more than that, and gossiping/being rude when they could have been far more helpful to their customers. Find another cafe nearby."
"Visited with a blind and deaf family member. Pleased to see quite many touchable objects. Had expected a larger museum. Many exhibits seemed a little crowded with the objects too close to each other. Nice place, but wouldn’t be back."
"Visited before but came as the museum was holding a Saturday Science afternoon. Wow! my son thoroughly enjoyed each activity and each adult responsible for delivering each activity, I could not fault their teaching and interaction with the children. Range of teaching methods including handling objects. Only criticism was it was advertised for children 8 years plus, my son is 9. A lot of children who were present were much younger than this and did not have any siblings age 8+ with them, so we had to wait between activities and the younger children tended to grab all objects, found it difficult to share etc as obviously they are much younger. The activities were geared and advertised for 8 years+ so this should ideally be monitored especially as I find as my son is getting older there is less on offer for this age group."
Great museum for adults and kids to keep them entertained for hours.They had a paint session for kids to make their own pin so it was great for kids to bring their own souvenir . Was free the time we went till end of February. Really recommend it to families
Had an excellent time in both here and Pitt Museum. Highly recommend. Free to get in.... so we have donation on exit.
