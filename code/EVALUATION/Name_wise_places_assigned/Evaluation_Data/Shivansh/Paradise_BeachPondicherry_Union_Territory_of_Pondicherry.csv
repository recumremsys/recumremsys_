"Calm, peaceful & less crowded beach, which is almost 5kms away from Pondicherry main center. Enjoyed the beach beauty to the fullest. Also has fun activities like rain dance, zorbing etc. Reached this beach via a boat ride (20-25 min). Got a chance to view the backwaters which is amazing."
"Its very good beach with one of the best location in Pondy. Very quite place for outing. You have to travel via boat to get there. Take your own food there, not very good restaurants are present in this beach."
One has to take Boat ride from Chunnambar Boat house. Google map shows 3 points for Paradise beach. Make sure you reach to Chunnambar boat house from where take a boat ride to reach the paradise beach. Its well maintained by authorities. Beach Life guards patrol the beach. Except the boating and swimming i dont see any other activities in the beach.
"Visited this place with family and very much liked it for it's cleaniness and scenery. One can reach the beach using the boat ride 15 min, from boathouse. They have two ticket counter, one for entry and parking ticket and other one inside is for boat ticket, charges 354 per adult. Counter opens at 9:30, which is a problem as you miss the morning time at the beach. It's a must visit place in Pondicherry if you are a beach lover."
Its quite clean and tidy. Have beach guards and facilities to clean up after playing around in beach.
Beach is very clean and smell is also very less. Lot of life guards to monitor people. you can travel to the place 2 ways via boat trip from boat house or direct road access too. Has good provision for bathrooms and changing rooms and a small rain dance place. Enjoyed a lot at the place with family
Beautiful place. It's a island where you reach by a boat. They change Rs. 300 per person which is worth a up and down trip to the sea through the lake. Sometime you may need to wait little longer to get the boat on your return. Plan the visit post lunch you can easily stau there till 6pm. If you visit in the morning or afternoon it would very sunny. Take required cloths so that you can play in the waves. You can take a horse ride Rs. 100 for kids and 200 for adults. Very neat and clean. You have restaurant as well for food. Good arrangement for showers. We throughly enjoyed and didn't want to come back
Lovely beach with very little crowd. Can spend quality time and lovely weather. Chilled out. Safe for family vacation.
Need some cleaning up of the place as its one of the best beaches in Pondy.  Windflower is just adjacent to the beach.
Don't compare with beaches of Andamans etc and just enjoy its own beauty and you will love it. Its not crowded at all. Its clean and well maintained. Has some shaded thatched sitouts which are great. Do take some snacks and water if you don't want to eat in smelly shaks there. Be a little conservative in your dressing though. Life guards are available. Though it didn't seem to be a swim friendly beach to me
Clean beach. 300 INR per person to reach the island in a motor boat. Also offers rain dance at the spot for an additional cost. Changing rooms available to make use of after playing in beach water. Not allowed to go in night.

excellent beach to spend long time.. unfortunately water sports were not available but the ticket booking folks will lie that its available. Do bring good sunscreen lotion to save urself from scorching sun
The beach is just 10-12 kms from the city. Boat ride is good to reach paradise beach. Restaurant at paradise beach is average. Don’t try much. Good time pass beach
"Paradise beach is for people who loves bathing in the sea. The beach is like a island to which you’re ferried through speed boats or normal motor boats. The beach is clean with clear sands. There are lifeguards right near the shores and they’re mindful of their work. Waves are very good. Not too heavy. Sea also is pretty clean. Once you’re done with bathing, you can take shower is the washrooms. Guys gets open showers with only tarpaulins. No rooms or doors. Be mindful of that. But thankfully women gets proper closed indoors but don’t expect too clean premises. As lot many women gathering together and women are generally restless ;) it’s chaotic . Overall beach is really nice for a day trip. You can have lunch once you return to main park. But we preferred a restaurant just opposite to the park gate. And it was really awesome."
"Good clean beach. Only one food outlet available, govt owned, but food quality not good. Rain dance place, ETV vehicle for kids available, changing room, and few other activities available. Good to spend time. Minimum Rs 300 entry fee to beach other than to 13 to enter the park. Parking fee separate."
Its really a great experience visiting paradise beach. Such a wonder full place to spend weekend with our friends and family. Get a chance to visit once if not visited.
"No doubt the beach is really beautiful. clean and serene.. However, the drawback is there are no beach shacks or sea side restaurants where you  can sit, grab a beer and enjoy this beauty... Given the temperature of Pondicherry, sitting without a shade for long is not possible..though there are some shades on the sandy stretch, but barely they are enough to cater to the no of tourists thronging this beach... However, its the only beach worh visiting in pondicherry... So yes...definitely should go once."
"nice place to visit , clean beach and worth visiting. please avoid weekends , long weekends along with public holidays . it is too crowded during those time"
"This is a beautiful beach on an isolated island, about 8 km from Pondicherry town. Approached by ferry from the Chunnambar boat house, the beach provides excellent group activity. Golden smooth sand is inviting for a rejuvenating walk in the cold sea water along the shallow sea shore. Good facility of bath rooms and wash rooms also exist, that is useful after swimming in salt water. Scattered huts for resting, and a seller of fresh tender coconut water are respite in the prickly heat reflected by sand. A lonely restaurant on the beach is not much of a help with its limited supplies and over-dependence on state electricity, which was cut off at that time and we didn’t get tea or coffee even! No doubt school children get here exciting activity, a solitary thinker sitting in a remotely located hut will also find equal bliss staring at the waves of the ocean!"
Spectacular windy beach. You can reach it by boat but you rather pay the difference to a Auto-riksha and you access it through land 6 km further down the road. Pay attention to the possibility of being ripped off and overpriced for the transportation. Ask first some local people how much should it cost and make sure that your driver understands you want to go further than the boat harbor.The sea is really rough here so take care with swimming and do not expect a bikini paradise.
This place is heaven for all who visit Pondicherry. Take a boat and go to this island and enjoy your entire day at sea shore. Don't forget to carry your drinks and food items else you will pay huge amount for these at shaft over shore and not much quality food as well.
"Its a clean beach but highly overrated - 1. Chunnambar boat house, from where you take boat to reach to paradise beach is highly mismanaged.2. Parking lot is mismanaged.3. Life jackets are waste and very very dirty.4. Once you reach at paradise beach, there are very few places to eat and very few beach activity which was in working condition. 5. Some guards will be standing, who will not allow you to roam from one corner to other without any reason.6. The changing rooms are very small, no hanging pins for clothes, in some there is even no water, on top of that there is about 2 inches of sand in every changing room."
IT s a wonderful place to visit. White sand and the calmness of the beach is quitesome. Make sure when you visit pondy drop in a visit.
Awesome beach ! So far it is well maintained by the people .Hope it stays clean.Very relaxing and safe. All ladies nothing to worry it's safe. Must vist Beach. Thanks to Puducherry to have such a wonderful beach. Good hang outs nearby for food and stay. Do not miss it . Do visit!
"One needs to catch a ferry to reach the Paradise beach. The fees are regulated by Pondicherry Government & no agents fly around. Just hit the counter & buy your tickets.Ferry ride is exquisite with serene view of water & green coconut tress just kissing the modest waves. Nature at its best. Two types are ferry are available - double decker(big) & single deck(small) Suit yourself. Of course, keep in mind the queue & timings.Rain dance is a major attraction for youngsters. Of course, there is mind blowing foot tapping music played by the authorities for you to enjoy in the rain dance.  Enjoy the Paradise (beach) CheersBharath"
"A must visit in Pondicherry. Clean water with white sand. Not much of water sports or activities. But nice scenic view. Life guards are present. Changing rooms and shower are just Okay. You need to go to Chunnambar boat house to take the boat to reach this place. If using google map, make sure to add Chunnambar as your destination and not paradise. We did this mistake and google took us to some backwater side with all narrow and broken roads. And there were at least 10 more cars just like us, following google map."
"It is an island accessed by boat. Takes around 8-10 minutes by boat to reach the same. Boats are operated by the Government Tourism department. The island is sandy, clean and bereft of vendors and beggars. There are two kiosks and food joints permitted by the State. It has got few water sports facilities. It is very sunny and has few huts to shade you. Many dogs roaming around. Good for youngsters who love the beach and sun."
"This is the true essence of Pondicherry. Kids and family will love it alike. Clean beach and crystal clear water is something of a rarity in India. Go early in the morning. A ferry will drop you at the island. Keep you Sun lotion and water handy. There is a speedboat for people looking for a thrilling ride. Though expensive, it is worth it. An inhouse island restaurant will help you quench your thirst and hunger pangs. A must visit when you are in Pondicherry."
"Awesome beach, very clean, white sand, not very crowded and you can enjoy it to your own.I would rate it better than Goa beaches anytime. Need to be careful as sea is really wild here."
"We took ferry ride to reach this beach, though i guess one can reach by road as well. Ferry price is 300/- INR per person (parking and per person entry charges extra, we paid 55 rupee in total). Beach is pretty clean and offer good time to relax and enjoy the waves. Very safe even if you go with kids as many life guards present on the beach. Carry your water bottle and sun glasses. There are couple of outlet on the beach for little refreshments, mostly fast-food. A good place to spend 3 hours on an average."
"A 20 minute boat ride takes you to this wonderful beach. It’s clean, the sand is soft and golden and the sea is awesome. Plenty of lifeguards around for the adventurous. If one is not a good swimmer it is better to get drenched near the shore. Go in the morning and enjoy the day. Don’t forget to catch the last boat back at 6 pm."
You need to hire a boat to reach the beach. It cost you around 300 rs pp for indian citizens. It is worth paying as beach is relatively unexplored and clean. Try to go after 3pm to avoid excessive heat. The restaurant on the beach was ok better to take food with you.. The paradise beach water was clean and you can enjoy it. Shower area and changing rooms available on the beach..
"The only golden sand beach in Pondicherry!How to reach/ other tips:1. Go to Chunnambar Boat House (Google maps navigation) 2. There you have to pay parking and entry charges (very nominal)3. Go to ferry boat ticket counter to buy tickets for ferry boat to Paradise Beach (Rs. 300 per person for round trip to & fro from Paradise Beach) where you can spend all day till 5pm and come back via return ferry which leaves every half an hour.4. Proper changing rooms, shower rooms are available at the beach (just after the entrance of the beach)5. Proper guards are there to warn you from going too deep in the sea)6. MInd the food you bring as crows/ stray dogs tend to take away the food from your bags.7. Apply lots of suncreen to avoid tanning.8. Variou small shacks are available to occupy on first come first serve basis.9. Washrooms are just adjacent to the changing rooms.10. Please bring water and small snacks with you as their are very few eating options available.11. In case of heavy rains ferry boat service is not available. (So call ahead as Chunnambar boat house is around 6kmm from rock beach."
"fine sand, very neat and clean beach maintained privately by the boat club people. thought the boat charges are high. but has nice facility to bath and after bath shower. rain dance facility available at extra cost. nice place to spend with a group of friends, family and for kids. this beach is ideal for bathing has life guards all around."
