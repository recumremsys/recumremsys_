"Beautiful fort in the pink city of Jaipur.  Great views from the Fort of the city and the walls.  Looks like the Great Wall of China, built on same type scale.  A must see in Jaipur."
When in Jaipur drive upto Nahargarh Fort. Enjoy this old rustic well defended monument of 18/19 centuries. Pay & 3/5 for tickets. Watch the sunset from high points while sitting down with tea snacks or beer. Sight monkeys. Enjoy the breeze. Bask in the sun in winter. Many other places in Fort to see and shop to buy from. Parking and wash rooms available. One in a lifetime visit when in Jaipur. See the Fort lighted up in night that govern the city as a sentinel on guard from danger and intrigue!
"Beside sunset view and the view of Jaipur city, i didnt really liked this place. Seems to commercial and many of the things are too artistic probably. You need a different mindset to gulp in and enjoy this fort. Though grandness at those times, do definately amaze!!"
This is the smallest but best fort among the three main forts of Jaipur. Enjoy with yiur freinds at Padav and RDB point
"A very beautiful view of Jaipur city. panoramic view of the city during sunset. Enjoy Sheesh Mahal, a more modern addition that houses a wax museum and a mirror room."
"Nahargarh Fort is located a little outside the Jaipur city. Within the fort there are different attractions. Let me warn you it can be quite a walk with steep staircases. My mother is a senior citizen and has issues with walking long distances; however she did not face that much difficulty. Ask your car driver to drop you at the car park. That is very close to the gate, reduces the walk. Inside the fort, there is a wax museum and sheesh mahal (must see). The ticket is on the expensive side however if your budget permits, don't miss the Sheesh Mahal. It is very beautiful and the do listen to its audio carefully. It is very interesting. The wax museum is fun. You are not allowed to click pictures inside. However, you can request for a photographer. Soft copies of the photos are provided at an extra cost.There are some artists displaying their skills like pottery, traditional folk music and a magician. These are just to pass your time till your turn comes to visit the Sheesh Mahal. Limited people are permitted inside at a time. Next, there is a step well, and a water storage tank. Just gives you information on how rain water was harvested in olden days. The views from this fort are breath-taking. Please don't visit the fort on a Sunday, we did that mistake. It was very crowded. Finally, there is Madhavendra Bhawan. We hired a guide and it was helpful to understand the history of the palace, the queens' rooms, toilets, bathing areas, summer residence, winter residence, chimney, how the king entered and none of the queens knew in whose chamber he would spend his time.... was all very interesting. If your budget permits, do hire a guide. We were charged INR 200/-. The tour took us a lot of time because of the crowd and the fact that I had senior citizens with me who walked very slowly. There are steep, narrow staircases to climb inside Madhavendra Bhawan, not too many though. 2 - 3 hours are sufficient here. There are restaurants inside the fort including a fine dining restaurant. I recommend don't eat from here if you are on a budget. Moreover, the taste is not too great either. There is a small eatery outside the fort which is cheaper. Can't comment on the taste as I did not eat.Overall verdict - Must visit!"
So much fun to visit this fort took a bicycle ride up.  Refused to ride down way to fast.  Our guides were wonderful no problem they got us a car to come down.  At the summit we had the and refreshments .  Do not miss
The entry fees are decent but inside the charges of wax museum and sheesh Mahal which are opened only few years back are having high charges. To add further to commercialization there are a couple of restaurants opened in Nahargarh fort. The sunset point is good one along with the rooms of the 9 wives which are similar in structure. Takes approx. 1 hour to have a full view of the places inside the fort. The view of Golf course and Jaipur city from Nahargarh is also an excellent one.
There is a road just by side of place and offers great view during evening. Suitable for making timelapse videos of city. Has pond where rangde basanti whs shot.
"You need atleast 2 hr if you want to explore every corner of the fort. You can see wax museum, sheesh Mahal. Well Maintained. No issue for parking, you can park your vehicle inside. Parking for free. Best time to visit (October -November or March to May)"
Gives a terrific view of Jaipur city. A visit around sunset time is definitely worth it. Takes about 1 hour to see the place and watch the sunset from sunset pointThe auto guys pester you to visit the house of wax inside the fort complex as they get a good commission but we skipped itThe view from the top makes the trip much worth the long drive
"Worth going. Cheap to get in. Visited on way to elephantastic. Good photo opportunities as so high up, great views."
"Easy queue for purchasing tickets. Interested in the grandeur lifestyle of Bharatiya (Indian) kings or architecture, history and traditions? Walk through this fort. The fort was absolutely clean, secured and it is well-organized for tourism. Information and signage inside the fort are helpful. Like all forts/sights, the best way to learn about the fort is to have a knowledgeable tour guide. This fort offers views of the city and its old boundary wall running across the hilly range. This fort has also hosted shooting of many Indian movies. Added attractions such as wax museum are worth one time visit. Do not miss Sheesh (glass) Mahal and other displays. Step well is a very interesting (technical, mechanical, eco-friendly...) spot. A restaurant on roof which seems to be good but not sure about the food."
For all the lazy people get up and enjoy a romantic sunrise at nahargarh fort! This can’t be missed! And if you can’t get up then enjoy here at the night time where you can see whole JAIPUR lit up from the mountain top! Visit the sunset point. It is so beautiful and surreal that you will be awestruck. Go and give your eyes a treat!
"Take advantage of the combined ticket which gives you entrance to 8 different sights, one of them being the Nahargarh Fort. You can enjoy the views from different viewpoints and don't miss the hidden passage way in the palace where the Maharaja could visit all his different wives unnoticed by the others."
Separate tickets for Fort and Wax museum. Buy tickets only for Fort visit.  Privately run Wax museum not worth Rs 500 per person. Instead you would spend more time in Fort.
"Not much to see at nahargarh fort, but don't forget to miss the sunset point as it gives a fantastic view of sunset. Reach atleast an hour before the sunset as the fort get closed before sunset so the tourist who are inside gets the opportunity to take some awesome snap of sunset!!"
"Nahargarh fort, my personal favourite out of all the forts in Jaipur. There are options ranging from autos to shuttles available from the foot of the hill. The yellow coloured fort in the otherwise pink city is so pleasing to eyes.  It has a special aura, and then there is this feel in its ambience that one cannot experience anywhere else. The never ending walls and ramparts of the fort makes one believe as if this fort shadows over the entire city. Its artistic elements, colourful wall decoratives and baffling structure of hallways and palaces surprised my senses. It is unbelievable that this enthralling and spellbinding structures are a product of our own human race. Madhvendra Bhavan in the fort was worth gazing at, for hours. Privacy was the prime concern while its construction. Separate rooms were dedicated to the nine queens of the palace and the gallery leading to the rooms were designed in such a way that it was not possible to know king’s visit to a particular queen’s room. Entire city, including the jantar mantra and the city palace is visible from the chief queen’s room. This was instrumental in supervising the upkeep of the subjects. When i looked out of the room’s window, the houses appeared like crowded match boxes stacked horizontally against each other. Not only aesthetic aspects were kept in mind, but utilitarian concepts dictated the elements like water harvesting and filteration. This is manifested in baolis (step wells) and johads.  There is a fascinating story behind the naming of the fort. Initially it was to be called Sudarshan garh. But it was becoming difficult to construct the fort. Every morning the workers would find the previous day’s work destroyed. This is when it was discovered that the land was haunted by Nahar Singh Bhomia. No concrete answers exist about his life story. He was believed to be a king but the soul was restless and wandered on Aravallis. The completion of the fort was possible after fulfillment of two conditions. A shrine was constructed in which the spirit could reside and the fort was named Nahargarh Fort.  Other attractions at the fort are Suraj Prakash mahal, chand Prakash mahal, Anand Prakash mahal. The wax museum and Sheesh Mahal are situated near the entrance of fort. The entrance fee (Rupees 350) for each is separate from the fort’s entrance fee. The Sheesh Mahal was designed to honor the Mughal and Rajput architecture. The significance of this glass palace is that it has a glass floor, which is not found in Sheesh Mahal in other parts of Rajasthan. The fort closes at 5.30 PM. This kept me dissatisfied as i wanted to explore more of this fort. Keeping the drive alive in me, i insisted my friends to again visit the fort again during late evening hours. But, the cops at the barricades at the foot of the hill doesn’t allow visitors at odd hours. We were prepared because our seasoned guide suggested us a way out. So if you plan to pay a visit to nahargarh at night, tell the cops that you are going to dine in at the restaurants at the fort. And believe me, it is worth every penny you spend at the restaurant, especially at The Once Upon A Time Restaurant."
"Great Location which require lots of walking.. but all an all a must visit place to understand the culture and history of Maharaja's time. Around 15 km from the railway station, easiy accessable through taxis.  Go and enjoy Nahargarg Fort, Sheesh Mahal, Sunset Point and Sunrise Point."
"Was there in End of December. This Nov-Feb is ideal period to visit this place. Went their quite early , to beat the rush..This is most advisable as by afternoon you may feel scared , as lots and lots of vistors throng this place. You just get into awe of the place , as these…"
"The fort is located on a hill outside Jaipur. Both Amer and Jaigarh forts are also located in the same hills so one can plan a visit to all three forts together. Nahargarh and Jaigarh forts are surrounded by strong walls and form the defense for Amer fort which is mainly for residential purpose. Located on a hill,  one can view the sun setting over the city from its ramparts.  There is a small restaurant managed by tourism department where one can sit over drinks watching the sun set."
Yes this place is worth visiting..  Beautiful.  Don't miss this place.  Worth visiting.  I njoyed visiting this palace
"Picturesque fort complex in the Aravalis surrounding Jaipur. Make sure you book your return transport in advance. Or else, you may choose to leave a bit early to catch an auto from the stand outside the main entrance. The auto drivers generally drop passengers till Jal Mahal."
Less crowded than other forts. You can have an awesome view of the city from here. Go before sunset so that you can enjoy the sunset there and have a pleasant and satisfactory evening.
"Come here in the morning or at sunset to get a great view of the city... Very near to Amer fort, not to be missed..."
"Not much visited by tourist, but i would say it is a must visit. Situated within the city but the road to Nahargad is a long route of 13 kms due to steep climbing. The palace, walking through the interconnected rooms, terrace view and step well are worth enjoying. There is wax museum there which i did not visit. The audio guide (through Captavia tour app) will help to understand the fort and make the experience more enjoying. Remember to download all the audio before going to the fort as there is network problem on the fort.Carry food and water along with you."
"Had been to this fort with my family. Though I had been in the month of September 2019 but the sun was very harsh hence it got little difficult to view with so much of heat. The fort is very good built in a huge area. The approach road to the fort is very beautiful and during the monsoon season its a very good route with awesome view of Aravalis. The view of Jaipur city from the top of the fort is really amazing. And I would like to say that if you have been to Jaipur the three forts Amer, Jaigarh and Nahargarh are must see. So don't miss these historic forts."
"The jaipur trip started with a bang. We visited this fort early in the morning at around 6 am. I am told that panthers are frequently cited near the fort.  On the next day of our visit,  a citing was reported in newspapers. I am told that there are no reports of attack on humans.  Anyway, it is a beautiful and long walk.  Make sure you wear proper footwear. It took us an hour or so to take a round of the fort and reach the place where our car was parked. You get a beautiful view of the city. The entree is free.  You will find lot of young,  college going people a top. Apparently it is a favourite picnic spot for the youngsters. On a sunday morning at 6 am,  we must have found around 10/150 youngsters in a group of 4/5 members each - boys and girls,  both. So the atmosphere is quite lively. You get a view of the city. It's an excellent photo opportunity.It is better to carry water and food as i did not find any restaurant nearby. A must visit place."
Skip it if you want. Not much to see here. Just restaurants and one palace which has now only bug brands name mentioned.
"A location that is an absolute must-see! Get a motorcycle, head there before the sunrise and enjoy the city panoramic view before everyone wakes up. I also had some fresh fruits from a guy who cut them fresh. After, take a beautiful road down to the city."
"Beautiful building, hosting a sculpture exhibition when we were there, also being lovingly restored. Cheaper and less busy than the Amber Fort, and you can take a lovely walk up/down to/from it from the edge of town. Recommended."
If you have not had your fill of forts then this is yet another one to visit. It is one of the three forts in Jaipur. Appears to have undergone some maintenance and visitors are apparently increasing as it was previously neglected. Going up is an adventure as the road winds up…
"As part of the day, it was great. Spectacular views, and we had lunch at the food court. At first sight this doesn't look like a good idea, but we sat under the tree and had some very tasty masala dosas and a bit of peace and quiet. The staff were really friendly. Recommended."
