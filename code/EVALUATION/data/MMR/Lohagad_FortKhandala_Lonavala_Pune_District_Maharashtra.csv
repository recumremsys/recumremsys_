0,Fort,Lohadad fort is greener fort of Maharashtra. Every where is green during monsoon season. This place is must visit place. There is combination of greenery and history.
1,Trek-enjoy view,Visited this fort during Monsoon on a Saturday morning. This place is very close to Lonavala so it gets very crowded during weekends. Best is to reach there by 9:00am. Car parking is available at the base and many local restaurants as well. Takes about 35 to 40 minutes hike to reach at the top. The hike is easy and you will enjoy flowing waters on the trail and steps. It gets very windy at the top so a oid carrying umbrellas. The major attraction on the top is reverse waterfall - waterfall flowing down from top blows back due to high winds - truly a unique experience. Must visit place during Monsoon.
2,Nicé,this fort is one of the historic place in lonavla. also best time to see this fort is during rainy season.
3,Visit to Lohagad Fort Lonavala,This fort is quiet popular in trekkers as well locals. Nice Nature place to visit in monsoon and winter. It's situated on hill. The fort is built in 18th century. Lovely natural place for history and architecture lover.
4,Great climb ,"A Lohagad Fort is very famous and ancient hill among all hills in Maharastra, we had visited with our guide we knew some ancient stories related that loved to explore this place nice surrounding enjoyed great time on the hills, was great time"
5,Nice for trekking lovers and photography,Lohagad fort is one of the nice fort in khandala  great place such a lovely place it was nice fort it was
6,"Nice view, super dirty","This is very big fort, nice for trek in monsoons. Very well preserved caves, fresh water lakes and temple. Vichu katta is a breath taking view. Fit for all ages. Awesome food at stalls beneath the fort."
7,Wonderful trek and beautiful view,"The name ""Lohagad"" (iron fort) has its weight. We visited the fort during monsoon - independence day long weekend. There was a long queue of cars - so had to park and walk about a mile to get to the bottom of the fort. From there on it was further a climb through the stairs for couple of hundred meters.The fort is an imposing monument - rising above a lofty deccan step hill. As one keeps climbing up, from different location can get vantage point views of the adjoining areas, hills, lakes and the valleys - the views are quite breathtaking.The fort has multiple levels with multiple viewpoints and a final terrace at the top. Keep 2-3 hours to explore all. Try reaching there by noon.Cautionary notes - unless you are outright romantic, avoid visiting in the monsoon. The place is poorly maintained and there is no safety measures. Under rain the place becomes even more untidy with water-logging inside the forts - be aware of loose stones and stairs. I am sure during dry season / winter, it will be a place worth visiting."
8,Unreal ...,The place is good with eyes catching scenic views of the Ghats. In Rainy season its would be the best.. but you need to be careful while trekking. Sport shoes recommended. Pune is full of trek places and the historic forts. This is one of those forts which you should visit while stay in Pune.
9,best for one day picnik also plan a stay at green fog guesthouse near aamby valley,"One of the beautiful place around Pune.Good scenic view, nice tracking place.Must visit place for person who want to enjoy rainy season"

Regarding the trekking is moderate risk that most of the stairs are in damaged condition, in monsoon season you have to take extra care.   Once we reached on top of the fort , scenic view is nice, Please take care of your belonging that there are few monkey they may snatch your bags."
14,Trek to Lohagad,Lohagad Fort is nice place to visit.There is entry fee to visit the fort.Nice maintain Lohagad Fort.Nice trekking experience.
15,Worth a visit,"Many people prefer to go by treking at Lohgad Fort from Malvali base. However, car goes till Lohgad village base from were you have to climb the stairs to go onto the top of the fort. This is the most beautiful place and you can have fresh and non polluted air. You can explore the fort by walk and can see historical places and points. You can also see the Pawana dam from this fort."

18,One of the best place to explore near lonavala,Lohagad is one those hill forts which is located near the famous weekend destination Lonavala. Just a few miles away from the main lonavala city. Lohagad fort is worth visiting. The fort has been well maintained and worth a trek. Surrounded by greenery from all side the fort stands tall. The best time to visit this is during monsoon. Normal trek can take you to the top of the fort where you can spend time chilling around. It takes hardly 20 25mins to reach the top if you are at a normal pace. Nearest railway station is malavli and you can find some local transport to reach the base of the fort. Good place to trek and spend quality time.
19,Good for Beginner Trekkers,This place is very famous for trekking mainly in rainy season. People come here with groups and enjoy a lot. Good place for photography also.
20,Lohagad fort,Brilliant view from top. Best time to come here is in monsoon .and thus how we came here Mumbai to lonaval and then malavli station and trek start you cn hire an auto to which take 50 each but while returning they increase their fares.So try to leave early on same cave n fort are not possible unless u have private vehicle .. Enjoy guys
21,Very easy Trek,"Lohagad Fort, or the Iron Fort counts under the top 15 Forts to Visit in the Maharashtra. Situated at 70 KMs from the City of Pune, this historical fort offers a stunning view of Pawna Lake from the top along with its own beauty of architecture.

You can spot various refreshment stuff sellers on the road and taking a trek with its road is a wonderful experience. On can also use the hill for professional trekking but it’s always risky.On the way, take a little diversion approx. midway of the trek, you’ll Bhaja Caves, WHICH IS 1800 YEARS OLD. Buddhist Cave, as they say, built in 2 Century BC holds ancient carvings and numerous stupas. It is a structure built from cut outs of 22 rocks (wiki) and is amazing attraction to see. One should MUST VISIT this place if planning to go to Lohagad Fort What is so Great about it.?Along the mesmerizing view of Pawna Lake with cold breeze and clouds toughing your skin, Bhaja Caves also serves an important and a MUST VISIT attraction if you plan to visit Lohagad FortWhat can be avoided here?The top of the Fort is 5 KM distant and 1000 m high, plan well if you have decided to trek the rout.

You can go with your private vehicle as well as it takes mere 2-hour max to have a drive from Pune to Lohagad.ProTip: Carry Cash as there is literally no ATMs (at least working ones) nearby. Also, everyone deals in case there.Carry light woolen cloths the hill top is cold a bit, Also, carry an Umbrella, you never know when rain gets happy on you.There is couple of resorts on the hills, so if you are planning to have a romantic gateway, this could be your choice. Mind the views and the climates is literally majestic."
22,A must visit monsoon destination ,This Scorpion shape fort is a good decent trek in the months of monsoon and later in the winters. It gets really crowded over the weekend during monsoons. Lot of gangs n groups trek n go to the top of the fort. Not many eating options. Recommend to carry food in the car and eat before and after the trek. Trek comprises of lots of stairs and top view is amazing. Not much visible during monsoons as u are surrounded by clouds else worth an attempt during either of the seasons. Carry water for the trek be it any season.
23,Difficult road,Plan to visit early morning and be careful during monsoon seasons becoz of steps.Road condition is not good.
24,nice place to visit,"It's very well maintained historical place.Located at a decent drive from kona vala and nice track.Mind blowing view from d topAlso, not to miss tea at d top"
25,must to go,"Lohagad Fort is located at a great height & to reach the fort, one has to climb a lot of steps. Initial section of the steps are neat, clean & well laid out, but as we go up ... the steps become muddy, dirty and NOT well laid out ... thereby causing us to climb slowly, cautiously and then the climb is not giving us a pleasant & great feeling. Many times ... I wondered ""why am I going up to see this Fort ?? It is not worth it !!! """
26,Amazing fort worth a visit!!,It takes min 3hours to complete the fort. It's very beautiful in winter and rainy season. It's a must visit place for people who visit Lonavala. The beauty of the place is unexplainable. Flowers are around the fort up which makes us feel like we are in valley of flowers.
27,awesome place,"Only visit during Monsoon, fogg everywhere and some scenic views await atop the trek. Huge fort having breathtaking views on all sides, covered by pawna lake and dam on one side and visapur fort on other. Fort is having an easy staircase access so everyone can visit easily. Vinchukada another amazing view above the fort is also awesome. Can be reached easily on bikes and is at a walk able distance from malavli local station."
28,Nice Quite Calm place to relax after the long trek,"This place is very good if you are looking for tracking and this is good to visit in rainy season. This place is good for photography also, but only in rainy season."
29,Epic experience,"Lohagad Fort is near Bhaja caves and if you have good driver and even better car, you can drive almost on top. Then there is like 300m walk on stone path, with monkeys watching you, to the bottom entrance. From there, it is several staircases (it's too luxurious to call them that, basically it is just stone path with shape resembling stairs most of the time) and several gates until you reach the top. If you will be lucky (or unlucky, depends how much experience you are looking for) to be there with huge crowd of locals, then you will be part of one giant mass of people moving to the top. And stopping every few seconds for selfie. But it is also part of the experience and totally worth it. You realize that, when you get to the top. There is excellent view to the dam below you (you better be there in rainy season, otherwise it will be empty) and also nice walk to the cliffs at the end. You just need to wait again in queue to get there, because it is a bit tricky path."
30,Lohagad fort,This place has nice architecture and the place is very big. Also the scenery all around is awesome. The wind at the top will gonna blow your mind.
31,Mesmerizing view from the top,"Lohagad Fort is an easy access from Pune, Mumbai specifically Lonavla. It is easily accessed from Malvali station. One can board the Pune Lonavla local that halts in Malvali and begin the trek. One can also drive down to this place, park to proceed for the trek.Parking can either be done at the start Lohagad fort area from where one has to walk a good distance about 3 kms to reach the base of Lohagad fort.The cars can also reach the base of Lohagad fort and you can directly hit the fort.Trekking from base to the top of fort is about 1 Hr and the other part of trekking is for 1 Hr. All in all 2 Hrs is a decent time frame for this trek.In my opinion one should not take the vehicle to the base of fort missing all the fun!!The place isn't too commercialized but is quite safe. There are shops seen at regular intervals offering hot tea with famous wada Pav. There was a waterfall too.. though not too.big, people were seen enjoying there.It is recommended to start the trek around 7:30-8 to enjoy the beautiful weather while the place isn't too crowded"
32,requires effort,This is a fort situated at Lohagad. The architecture is so amazing. This place remind us the history of India.
33,Truly mesmerizing ,Must visit Lohagad Fort During Monsoon For a Day Trekking Specially who looking for a one day trek from mumbai Also it's advisable to walk from Malawi station to experience true joy of nature.
34,A Trek Worth Remembering!,its a excellent destination to trek during monsoons.The rains make the place so hauntingly beautiful. Hope to go back and visit again on a clear & sunny day.
35,Lohagad Fort,We visited on 15/01/2017 from Mumbai by our car which goes till base of Fort and parking available thr parking charges is rs 50.climb to Fort is not so difficult but take precautions as some places are tricky to climb as no proper stairs. We saw family having small kids having problem so take call on it to bring kids or not. At top view is great. Pawana Lake view is awesome and scenery all sides gr8. Overall we enjoyed our sunday.worth going
36,Adventure,"its one of the best destination if you love Nature and forts. even there is CAR parking below Fort. also along with Trekking you can enjoy waterfall in rainy season, and pandavas cave (Bhaja caves)"
37,A must do!,The Fort is good. Clean. Take food with you cause its too inside in village and do not have good shops or eatable items available near by. Be careful of monkeys. They attack on food. Good view from top.
38,its not good enough to me,Very close from pune and 30 mins bike ride. Visit during monsoons - the place is flush with greenery. Take some snacks and drinks and travel to the top with freinds. Its a good experience.....
39,Interesting Fort to visit,"Road to Lohgad fort is very steap. Final about a Km is walk way using stairs well maintained by administration. It takes about 25 to 30 min with intermittent rests to reach top. On top is quite a large area with small water ponds, Dargah,temple etc. Fresh water source from stones.You need at least 45 min to all around top."
40,Get ready for a trek,This fort depicts the history of Shivaji maharaj. But it has more than 200 steps to climb its first entry door. And it has timings from 7 am to 17:00 on all around the year. It minimum takes 3-4 hours to view the fort. There are eating outlets at base parking area. Nothing will be available inside the fort to eat. Anyone planning to visit this fort with kids should carry drinking water and small quantity of snacks.
41,Must visit for a late Afternoon.,This fort has great view once reached to the top. We have steps to climb so no much difficulty. Had awesome time and lime juice sold in the fort by a local guy was awesome.
42,Trek with Friends,"This place is quite historic and long trekking as well, big gates and view from top is simply amazing"
43,Lohagad,"This is one of the fort of maratha King chatrapati shivaji maharaj .you need to reach till the base of the fort either by your car,bus or by walk .you should try to   visit for as early in morning as possible .good time to visit is during rainy season as so many waterfalls welcome you . Nearby villages make the arrangements of guest who want to stay .very nice view from the top of the fort .must carry camera for good pictures with nature .carry water bottle if needed . Enjoy the waterfalls in nearby area ."
44,Lohagad,Its a very old historical fort having lots of steps to reach on top of it. From top it gives a very good aerial view of Lonavala. But it is not maintained properly and most of the fort is in bad condition.
45,Holiday ,"Well accessible fort, good time spend, best during monsoon though...i had been here 5-6 years before as well. that time restoration has not started, when i went this time it was in a far better shape..also it looks like mini kaas plateau there.."
46,Lohargarh Fort Lonavala,"Lohagad fort is a must visit place around Lonavala. The climb is high and all steps, but the view from top is breathtaking. It was raining the day I went, and could see clouds moving around. The only thing that I would like to add is to be careful while descending the steps as they might get a bit slippery. It is a must visit place!"
47,Fun trip ,I am from Punjab and visit lohgard fort on later dec. not find much in Lonavala as per expected. but if you visit lonavala then this is of must visit destination. you have to trek through steps. its hard for old one but good trek for young one. after reaching top of fort you will get nice view. The connected road to this fort is in very bad condition. Have many monkeys around fort so you cant take food along with you. There Have small food corners arround but we had a food near Pawana lake that cost of food as per 5-star hotel but food quality is too low.
48,Tough climb,This place has very rich heritage and the structure of the fort still remains good . One needs to climb up pretty much to reach the fort . Place offers breathtaking scenery . It is not too hot in the way. Trees are there to rest . Must to see our architecture
49,Must visited place in lonavala,This is one of the best places to visit in Lonavala and also one of the popular historical places in Maharashtra.
50,Good trek with family (small kids),"This Fort is located in khandala and is a must go destination for tourist and nature lovers alike. The place is on the foot of the hills and is surrounded by beautiful waterfalls on its boundary. The people like me can enjoy the trekking (as you can't go all the way in your vehicle and it's a somewhat steep climb), the waterfall (here you can take a bath as well though you might want to climb a little higher if you want to bathe in clear water) and the inspirational nature. I don't think you would want anything else here after this. Just sit on the hill, play will the water and admire the beauty of a man made historical structure in the lap of nature."
51,An Easy trek with splendid view (Ideal for first timers),"Other than Sinhagad, I think this is another fort near Pune where you can see a lots of fortification and you have good constructed steps to climb up. I don’t have enough vocabulary to express my feelings of the Pawna Lake view from the top of the hill. I can only share the picture I have taken. Better you try on your own :)But the MOST IMPORTANT thing that I should tell you is the MONKEY TROUBLE you will find there. However here are some suggestion from me which could make you feel that that’s nothing.1.	DON’T carry any food or plastic carry bags with you. If you want to carry food then kept then confined in your rucksack until you reach the top.2.	DON’T ever make mistake of leaving your belongings apart. I made this mistake and had to became fearless to get it back which is not recommended as a bite from them may need you take immediate medications. I put my bag down for photo pose and a healthy grabbed it. See photo where you can see I am busy posing for the picture, while the creature was thinking to grab the bag and my 6 year old son is looking at him but not intelligent enough to warn me :)3.	DON’T look at them or make any sound to them. 4.	DON’T try to scare them with small sticks or false act of throwing stones. They are very intelligent species so if you really want to scare them then do it with a real fat stick or a big stone and a strong heart off course :)And the last but not the least, DON’T through plastics around and keep the place clean and try not to feed or hurt the monkeys."
52,Nice little trek experience ,"excellent fort, must to visit, once u reach on top, amazing view. u can see whole view of khandala, lonavala, govt must keep it little more help for people, otherwise all excellent"
53,Glory of Old Times of Chhatrapati Shivaji Era,best part is reverse waterfall. little crowded. monsoon is the best time to visit. food stalls available
54,Natural Beauty,"The fort is located near Lonavla; and is easy to climb till half. The upper part of steps are heighted, sloped and broken. There are 2 ponds, 1 temple on the top. There is lot of wind and fog during rainy season; almost impossible to see beyond few feet."
55,Lohagad Fort - Get to the top for a Panoramic View of the Mountains and Pawna Lake,The trek is excellent..The beat time is rainy season..We went in winters and place was very beautuful at that time too..The fort walls are intact.The view around the fort is excellent
56,Famous for trekking,"The best time to visit is Rainy season. We went to Lonavala in August 2016, we reached Lohagad Fort around 12 pm which was fully covered with fog. We enjoyed through out the climbing. Carry Water bottles as we should reach the top and beware of monkeys. Great place for nature lovers"
57,Good for Beginners,"We went to this place from pune, the road from Lonavala is not god, on our we back we took Pavana Lake route and the road is awesome. This is very simple track, you need to go up through stairs from base village. We coldn't roam around much in the fort up, as it was raining very heavily, but there are few temples one can visit."
58,Great Experience,Its a little far from the central area of lonavala and khandala. But can be visited. In monsoons its even more beautiful
59,Great Experience with nice View,"Its a beautiful experience to go up this fort, walking along the road path & through the fort steps from malvali station with the friends."
60,Awesome experience!,One of best places to visit for ancient structures. When you reach at top feel like something very amazing view from above that nobody wants to miss. Nice place.
61,Surely coming back here,"Approx 18-20 kms from lonavala market, this fort is situated close to pavna lake. Its better to keep lohagad fort, pavna lake and bhaja caves for the day sightseeing. Need to trek to reach the top. Easy cum moderate trek but previous experience of trekking is not needed. An amateur trekker can also complete this. Very beautiful view from top. A worth visit place."
62,Rich heritage and wonderful views ,"Visited on last weekend as we have weekly off on Saturday. Started from Shivajinagar,Pune local train to Malvali station. The local train timetable is available. Prefer morning time as it gets full so quickly. Got down to Malvali and started walking. Bhaje village is on 2 km distance, we met many waterfalls in the way. You can visit to Bhaje caves if you want. We proceeded towards Lohgad. We reached there in around 2 hrs. Many stalls were there for wada pav, chai and kanda bhaji.We found too much crowd and traffic jam of people while climbing the steps. So please prefer weekdays for visit. Please carry raincoat instead of umbrella as it is of no use because of high wind.Enjoy..."
63,Lohagad ,"An abandoned fort on top of a mountain, an hour plus drive from Pune. Best time to visit is monsoon/post monsoon or summers for sunsrise/sunset views. A typical hill top fort in Maharashtra with different darwazas and spectacular views. Carry food and water. Its a 30 minutes trek to the top from the base."
64,Pleasant trek!,We tried to drive to Lohagad fort from bhaja caves but road was very bad. The fort is situated at the peak with very sharp curves and bad road. So we ended the journet without visiting it.
65,Nice little trek,This is situated near lonavala. You can go by state transport bus also and have to get down in village at base. Good to visit in winter or rainy season. Will be blast if visiting with friends while tracking. Must visit place if coming to lonavala
66,Trek + Breathtaking Views,A great placeMaintained well You can see the war idea of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj & All mavale. Best view
67,Must visit fort,"In rainy season there is lots of greenary there,  height is very good,  ice cold weather,  fog,  clouds,  Fort n you are in between all.  Little difficult last few stairs due to rainy water but it's a good tracking experience."
68,The fort is must watch,Its a must go place in monsoons.You can drive to the base village and then trek to top.Its not so difficult.View of Pawana dam from the top is very beautiful.
69,"Fort, waterfall and the nature!!","I visited Lohagad fort twice in last rainy season. It was my first trek done in Pune. Nearest village is Malavali(2nd last railway station, when you ravel from Pune to Lonavala). Trek started from railway station only, after a KM real trek started & many waterfallls were there. There were 2 ways- left & right left path will lead you towards caves & right path will lead you towards Lohagad fort."
70,A celebration of monsoon,I had been treking to lohagad for last 10 years. It was fun back then now lot of people flock and make the place dirty. Good for beginners but not a place for advance trekkers. The view from top is beautiful. Best for 1 day visit.
71,Lohagad ,We walked from Malavali local station all the way to lohagarh fort. There are several small waterfalls on the way. Trekking is easy. You can take a local guide. They charge 100rs per person. You can take a cab to base village.
72,Good place,"Beautiful place , Neat and clean , ample parking, breathtaking scenario, vinchu kata point is must do visit this"
73,Lohagad : five stars only because it was fun for me in a rainy day ,"The best place to hike around lonavala, the lohagad fort is a good climb and the views from top are really amazing"
74,Best viewed in monsoons,Easily accessible (private vehicle) this is one of Shivajis forts. Legend has it that the treasure from the sack of Surat was hidden here somewhere. An interesting single day visit there are stairs that lead to the top. The VinchuKata (scorpions sting) extension stands out. Relatively decently maintained.
75,Breath-taking views and well-preserved fort,"We did Lohagad in Nov-16, took the road from the Pawana side, in rainy season this road is an absolute pleasure to drive and was hoping to have a similar experience as were were travelling very close to end of rains, however the roads were not as scenic as anticipated. Never the less, you have agriculture plantations on both sides to it was a good experience.WE did spend some good time at water canal and that was indeed refreshing, with gushing water.Then comes the actual fort. Earlier when i visited this place in monsoon, the road had withered, but in Nov the initial road was newly made and had no trouble with our vehicle. Those who are newbies should be careful with the drive here.The climb was not sever as we had taken the route to the top, regardless, it surely can be a task if you are not used to climbing.We had a couple of senior citizens with us and who also managed the walk of the stair (incase that helps for your planning)Once on top, where is not much of sightseeing actually. Finding a decent place to each can be a challenge due to shortage of trees on the fort and the the usual suspect monkeys.Had a fantastic lunch picnic and then we covered the fort tour. Vinchu Kada is a must visit spot and it really great sight.Monsoon its definitely a must visit place"
76,"Nothing great, can avoid","The history of this fort is majestic. The architecture itself is very interesting and worth a visit. On top of the hill, there is well, a temple and a dargah and offers a fabulous view.The trek is long and slightly difficult. Must be 2-3 kms with stairs, but the last stretch is not properly maintained and the steps are broken. Would be difficult for people with leg problems or senior citizens. There are interesting landmarks on the way, but no information available anywhere to read up. No guide to help you out with the way or with the history. Even at the top, there is a confusing signboard. You are pretty much on your own. You will encounter wild monkeys on the way, which can be pretty scary and unsafe.Don't expect anything other than scenic views while going here. This place does not deserve a certificate of excellence at all."
77,Excellent place for trekking,"It's a really nice fort near Lonavala. I think it is situated at just same distance from Mumbai and Pune. One can reach there by cab,bus or even train. Alight at Malavali stating, hire an auto till base point and start tracking. From the top of the fort (Mountain), you will see a mesmerizing view."
78,Brilliant experience! ,This is one of the fort which you have to see in the evening. this is while you are going to pune from lonavala
79,Iron Fort - Lohagad Fort,"Its amazing to go up this fort, walking or riding along the road path & through the fort steps from malvali station. Wonder how these guys built it as it has a 360 degree view of the entire surroundings. For the enemy its pretty difficult to reach to the top as its well planned to attack. Its worth a day visit. NO TICKET"
80,Good Fort Its Clean and Quiet,"Nice fort with around 400 odd steps but most of them are steep to climb for young children. Nice cool air at the top even during March though, which takes out all the stress of climbing all the way up.Recommended for Fort lovers; would help if local guides are available."
81,Nice Trip,"We traveled from pune to base of Lohgad fort. If you see Lohgad Darshan hotel , yes you have reached base of fort. Please do note that although you can drive down to base Village of Lohagad, but the road up to the fort is extremely narrow, with lots of turns and twists. A Rs 50 parking charges are levied by the gram panchayat for 4 wheelers parking. If you guys can trek a little and coming by car it is better to park near malvali village ( 200m before bhaje caves ). We had breakfast from Lohgad Darshan hotel and in 40 – 50 mins reached top of Lohgad. It is breath taking view from lohghad."
82,History and adventure together ,Must visit place. To reach the starting point of loghad fort is very challenging drive in 2 wheeler and 4 wheeler. While climbing to hill especially while raining gives a greeny pictorial view with cloud covered.U can walk inside cloud at the top of loghad fort.
83,Things to remember,"Lohagad Fort trek is a standout amongst the most prevalent trek points near Pune/Mumbai followed by Sinhagad, Rajmachi, Torna, Tikona, Rajgad and many more. Unlike other forts, it has stone steps leading right to the top of the fort which makes it easy even for a novice climber. Out of the numerous forts located in the region, I would rate this as one of the most effortless and secure forts to climb."
84,Cloudy and Greeny View,"The historical fort stand tall and mystically amazing close to lonavala. The track is quite strenuous but ones you are on top, its worth the effort. You get an amazing view of lake pawna  amist clounds during monsoon season. Definitely one of best places to explore neat lonavala."
85,Monsoon trek to Lohagad,We friends went lohagad fort for trekking.lohagad fort is in Khandala. We went Khandala by bus.Lohagad is one of the many hills forts in Maharashtra .it is situated closed to the hill station lonavala. The load fort is connected to visapur fort.
86,Awesome view!!,This fort is old and good ..best thing is it's surrounding view from the top of the hill..else nothing exceptional about this Fort..
87,Good place,"Visited this place last weekend. It is 90 min drive from Pune. It took us 30 mins to reach the top of the Fort as it was raining. The stairs are slippery so be cautious. Its better to wear shoes as some stairs were submerged in water.As we visited the place on rainy day, it was completely covered in mist and it was raining continuously. Its best to avoid bringing camera in rainy season. We stayed at top for nearly 2 hours enjoying the rain and gusty wind.The trek way down was tricky as the path was bustling with people trying to climb up. It took us almost 90 mins and lot of jostling to get down. This place is extremely crowded during weekend in rainy seasons. Our ordeal didn't ended there. We had to face traffic jam upto 5 kms because of people parking their vehicle in road. It is a no go area on weekend for sure.One must enjoy maize, tea, pakoda in rains enroute to Fort which makes the trek worth remembering. Also you can find lot of makeshift waterfalls during monsoon."
88,Easy trek and reverse waterfall at the top,"We are group of 5 friends. We are planned to visit some places nearby Pune. We decided to visit Lohgad fort since it's very beautiful during rainy season and  now I am confirming that our decision was very good and we have really enjoyed our visit to Lohgad on 28th July 2018. We started from Hinjewadi, phase 2 and we have taken the backside route instead of Pune highway. We traveled through Hinjewadi-Mulashi-Pavana dam and we reach Lohgad around 12:30 pm. Then we started treak and we have spent around 3 to 4 hrs on Lohgad.It's wonderful and memorable visit !!"
89,Must visit in Rainy season,"We visited Lohgad fort on a Sunday. This place is 75 KM's from Navi Mumbai. Vehicle can go upto the fort and parking is available. Initial laps for vehicle looks dangerous and most people park their vehicles on the way. But after some laps, the way is easier and I would suggest everyone to take vehicle upto the fort. Once you start climbing the stairs, the view of the valley is beautiful. It takes about 30 minutes to climb up. Once you are at the top, you find a Shiva temple and a small pond. View is nice and wind blows fast.Very good for morning to evening trip from Mumbai. Best time to visit during monsoon. Don't forget to carry umbrella for each person. Also wear floater as water wud be flowing down the stairs and with shoes it will be difficult to climb."
90,One time visit is worth it!,It’s a nice fort near to pune. One can take a train and visit this fort by getting out at malavali train station. Don’t miss reverst waterfall in monsoon!
91,Lohagad Fort a nice treck,Brilliant views if visiting in Monsoon Should start the trek early morning as it gets too crowded in the daytimeStart trekking from the Malvali village itself to enjoy the views at best
92,Spectacular View From the top of the Fort,"Around 5 km for the base village where one has to pay Rs.5 per person to gram panchayat to visit the fort. Advisable for people to park their vehicles near the Bhaja caves base as the route to Lohagad fort is steep and very bad. Not only you need to be a profession driver but you may spoil your vehicle due to the bad roads. Since it is single lane road maneuvering the car is very difficult.You can walk to the fort base or can take a taxi who charges RS.50 per person.From the base of the fort there are 350 steps to the top of the fort. The steps are very steep, so one has to take stops and walk to the top. This fort was were Shivaji Maharaja had kept the Gold loot from Surat. Therefore the caves are called Laxmi caves. One can see Pawan lake to the south and Valvan lake to the north from the top"
93,An experience of Trekking with water,"I visited here in monsoon and it was awesome, such a picturesque place. The hike is pretty good and will be a fun thing to do with friends. A beautiful place, though stay clear of people who charge you parking fee for your vehicles as there is no charge for the same here."
94,Beautiful Place to visit,"Clean Easy fort. Steps available to climb. Monkeys on the way. hence keep eatables away. Takes 45 mins with kids. We had 2 5-10 yr olds and a toddler. small tank, temples and hillocks on top."
95,single trip multi package,"Best for one day trek & easy for every1.One can get food easily but bit expensive, Amazing view from top of Fort.Dont forget to get yourself pedicure naturally from Fish for Free"
96,Most easiest trek,"Any one visiting Lonavala should must visit this fort. This fort requires at least 20 min steps to be ascended to reach the top of it.What a commendable job by the authorities to provide such a comfortable steps for ascending which I have rarely encountered in any other such forts. People of any age groups can easily able to go up. But needed to be more careful enough during rains the steps become slippery due to the presence of moss.Fort is amazingly built and indeed adds value to the history of India.After reaching the top of it there's a great mesmerizing view of the pavana Lake and western ghats. Just before the final steps reaching its top of Fort approximately 20-30 there's come a point where the corner one of the openings blows air like anything. What an amazingly fresh and cool breeze. Being tired one can have quick test at that point and experience this natural breeze and appreciate the beauty of this forts design. There's a marking of ""AC"" over that opening which indeed it's more than that.Beautiful fort and a beautiful experience of the day!!"
97,A beautiful place to visit in Monsoons,"The Lohgad Fort is related to a Chhatrapati Shivaji's era and it was used for keeping prisoners. In the battle of 1670,the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj won this fort. This is a recognized structure which is famous for its four walls that are still in an unbroken state, this gives you the idea of old times glory."
98,Good for Trekking,I thoroughly enjoyed my trek to Lohagad Fort. Beautiful well cared for historic location.  The site is well maintained and provides beautiful views of the surrounding countryside. A+ in my oppinion.
99,Best location to enjoy with family,"Lohagad fort is a good place to trek during the monsoon for the beginners.This is an easy trek and have stairs from the base of the fort. Parking is available here.Food and washroom are available at the base of the fort.The view from the top is amazing, the Pavna lake is visible from the entire route.Pavna lake and Lonavala are situated near by and are good place to cover."
100,Decent climb but worth it,"Though Lohgad fort is an ideal one-day trek and if one can start early in morning from Mumbai, he/she can be easily back to Mumbai by evening, but as I was taking my 4 year old son and my wife with me & for both of them it was going to be their first trekking experience, so I decided to take it little easy and thus we took a train from Mumbai to lonavala and stayed night at MTDC Karla. Next day we started our trek early in the morning and reached Lohgad wadi (base of fort) by car. However one can also walk to Lohgadwadi from Malavli railway station, which is 5-6 Km away, this will also allow to have a scenic view and admire nature’s beauty. Please note that the way to base village from Malavli station is actually a very steep ghat with sharp turns and so better to hire an experienced local driver rather self-driving.From the Lohgadwadi, it was a really easy and beautiful trek. No chance to get lost and also safe as it is usually visited by number of travelers (this could be negative as well if you are looking for a serious trek).It took us around one hour (including many short breaks) to reach at top as we had to climb simple steps. Halfway to the fort top you can see magnificent view of Pavna Lake on one side visapur fort on other side. We did this trek in November when the winter was just setting in and thus didn’t feel the exertion or fatigue.This trek is ideal for monsoon time, but avoid taking kids with you during this time as the steps can get slippery. In summer it can be really hot, so for those who are travelling with kids or elderly, the winter and early morning start would be ideal time."
101,Nice experience,"Location is near malawali station..I prefer to go from pawana dam instead malawai station road...From malawai station, reach to bhaje caves. Diversion road reaches to fort...Road is too stiff to reach at fort...you must be skilled driver..you will find lots of youngster heading towards fort by walk or bike...Best time to visit fort is when rain stopped for 1 or 2 days before visit.You will find small hotels with limited sitting and will get kanda bhaji, tea, omelette, bhurji, zunka bhakari, maggi...Another way is from pawana dam. Road from pawana dam is also stiff and ghaat road..so it is recommended to use bike/activa instead car for couple.."
102,Beautiful historic location,"This fort is probably one of the cleanest and well maintained forts in this area. The local gram panchayat [village council] has signs all over about waste reduction and cleanliness. What makes this fort unique is the clean and easy access to the top and the well maintained steps and walls that adds to the beauty.Once you reach the top, there are clear signs indicating what stood there once among the ruins. Keep walking all the way to the end of the fort and you will see another part of the fort that no one seems to visit. If you are ready for a small adventure then climb down to that area which is of course cordoned off with strong railings and walk all the way to the end where you will see a flag fluttering in the wind. Once you reach this flag the scenery is breath taking and the wind will make you want to hold on to something."
103,Lohagarh treck,best for trecking who are interested in nature.from railway station it is approx 10km. once you get there need to climb using steps.The top of fort is just amazing.
104,Historic,"Lohagad Fort can better be avoided. Instead visit Pavana Lake, Bhaja and Karla Caves which are on the same route and better accessibility. Lohagad Fort is all climbing stairs to just see the valley view from top, nothing else. It has more stairs than the two above mentioned caves have. You can get the valley view and a much better view from Bhaja Caves. While climbing stairs to Bhaja Caves one gets beautiful hill view. Lohagad stairs in the starting are better but as you go higher and higher, stairs are broken, missing, uneven and risky to climb specially in the rainy season. Moreover there are no railings on the stairs to hold. Surrounding rocks are slippery to hold so one cannot have grip while climbing up or down. Must avoid this place during rains because of two reasons. Firstly due to rains no valley view can be seen as it is covered in all dense fog so wastes the purpose of climbing stairs all the way up. Secondly during rains the stairs get more slippery due to running water. Lonavala is all natural beauty. One can see hill view from many points. At the base of stairs there are few restaurants which serve hot maggi, omlette, tea, etc."
105,Nice Trekking Spot near Pune/Lonavala,"It's located of Mumbai-Pune Highway, close to Pawna Lake.There is small parking at the entrance, and a place to eat (Shivkrupa Hotel) is right opposite.The Fort is open to visitors from 7am to 5:30pm daily. There is no entrance fee.The climb to the top is quite easy - there are steps all the way. Steps are good till about half way or more, almost to the First Gate. Then its little broken and may be little difficult for old people of very small kids. But it is still very much ok. (Still families come here with young and old!)Once you're up, you get to see tombs, water tanks, a temples and (possibly) a mosque.We didn't have much time since we ran up by 5:25. Kids enjoyed, adults enjoyed. Climb was satisfying, view was spectacular from every point... we sure are coming back for more!(Carry your water, maybe snacks - if planning to stay long - but make sure there are no noisy wrappers since monkeys are around. They won't come to you unless they believe you have something they want.)"
106,Historic Attraction,Excellent trek. This fort treking can be done with kids as well. From top of this fort you can enjoy the beauty of entire Lonavala. Worth to trek Lohgad.
107,Trekker's Paradise,"best trekking experience at lohagad fort with friends , started early morning with sunrise took 1.5 hrs to reach on top , enjoyed our trek in the evening planned stay at green fog guesthouse near aamby valley best accomodation option near aamby valley must try.."
108,A good trek place,Good Trekking spot during monsoon. It's a Medium difficult trek for new trekkers if planning to. Put your eatery stuff inside your bag and beware from monkeys there.
109,Good for 1st time trekkers,"Family with small kids should not attempt to climb during monsoon/rainy season.Ideally, winter (Nov-Feb) would be bes to do so.It is prudent to park your vehicle prior to ascending the ghats, as thare are many vehicles, which are parked in an haphazard manner, making return/downhill drive difficult, as same would be blocking your path.Car parking facility exists at base of steps to fort.About 350 steps lead atop fort.Plenty monkey to give to you company en route.Ensure to have sufficient water and snacks, as same limited at Lohagad wadi.This includes non existent wash room facilities.Section of steps are damaged/broken, exercise care with kids.There are quite a few stops for breathtaking views of surrounding area.Plan your ascend as early in morning and descent, by your lunchtime.Wear walking/trekking shoes including cap/sunglasses.Avoid holding food items in hand, to avoid same being frisked by monkeys."
110,A Trek to Remember!,Starting from malavli..Enjoying small waterfall on way Feelings like flying in cloud...Heavy rain with wind...Test tea at top of loh gadh..
111,Monsoon Trek Delight,"The fort is one of the highest forts within Maharashtra, but trekking is always good and enjoyable. Along with my friends, we enjoyed."
112,Good for beginners ,Beautiful place to visit but not maintained well. The fort was very big and beautiful. You will need to walk for about half and hour to go on top because no vehicle goes there.
113,Good place for tracking,"Have trekked in this fort during rainfall and it was an awesome experience.There were puddles of water every where and very slippery  but enjoyed the experience.All along the trek, we get yummy hot food like maggi, cor, wada pa etc which u can enjoy but beware of monkeys.. they can snatch your snack"
114,Transformed into an Excellent Family Picnic Trek,"Visited the fort with a couple of friends. One has to climb more than 500 stairs to reach the fort. Yes the view is worth the efforts. It is not only the fort but also the view of the Pawana lake, which is breathtaking.The visit gives a nostalgic feeling of the Maratha empire during the great Shivaji and his successors."
115,Nice fort,Great place to visit with friends and family when in Lonavala. Make sure you come in the monsoons which makes the area all the more beautiful!
116,A must vist place for trekking enthusiasts,Beginner level of trekking. Very easy to reach from Pune by road or by train. I love there natural resources. One day outing is best destination.
117,Worth the walk up to the top,amazing place to visit in monsoon...where you can literally not see the person next to you because of the clouds...and yes....dont forget to visit scorpion point...the end of the lohgad fort
118,Nice Walk to a long fort wall,"Excellent destination for a monsoon trek. Well laid out roads, steps to the fort, safe and easily accessible from Lonav"
119,excellent place to visit in winter/rainy starting season,"Visited this place in the month of Julh. The monsoon was at its peak and it added to the USP of this fort. The problem with this place is same as  with most places easily approachable from Mumbai/Pune which is too much rush. The steps are steep and at some places are quite dangerous to climb on. Wearing a pair of trekking shoes is advisable. You can go on the top of the fort and click some really good pictures with great views in the back drop. But one thing that I would like to bring into everyone's notice is the tar road that reaches to the base of the fort. Well the condition of the road was nice given the heavy monsoon witnessed but they are very steep. At some places there are turns which might scare you. So of you are planning to drive your vehicle to the base of the fort, make sure you are skilled driver and have enough fuel because a lot of it going to burn.I would also suggest a check up of your vehicle before you head to the fort. It is fun as long as you can control your vehicle and manage the steep turns. There will also be rookie drivers who might spoil the fun with their irresponsible driving. Have a safe trip!!Cheers!!!"
120,Safety First,You need to have good walking shoes and tougher mind to reach the view point of this fort. Views from the top are amazing and worth the effort taken to reach there. To make it more difficult you can try to cover Vinchukata point.
121,Awesome fort....Bhaja Caves nearby (read my review for directions),"When you reach to top of this fort there will be nice view. There are some steps to climb until that. This fort is well maintained. Sometimes monkeys come as groups. Don’t try to give them foods because they may attack you. Before climb steps keep some water bottles with you because in middle you may need water. I could get foods before enter to this fort. There were Wada paw, noodles.I needed 45 minutes to climb top of this fort.I went in weekend so there were people. But not so crowded.Actually this place is good construction and this is one the must see location in Lonavala. Nice place for photography"
122,Old historical fort,We went there in rainy season. There was a heavy rain fall that made our day so adventures. One can go to the base of fort by car but I suggest to trek there from railway station which is around 6 km far. The trek will serve the beauty of nature. Rain will make your trek adventures. Go to the top of fort. The view from top of farms around fort and the nature was awesome.
123,good visit with freinds,"During raining prefer raincoat rather umbrella due to heavy wind.Beware of monkeyes on the stairs, they try to snach ur food.Dont put legs/shoes on cannons and others holy things. Locallites are very sensitive on it. A men was beaten by stick when he stood on cannon lying on floor. It was very cruel. If they respect why cannons are lying on floor where crowd is walking?Bring drinking water and some lightweight item to eat.Do not jump in pond as sharp stone inside."
124,A Breathtaking view,The base camp is near to Lonavala. Vehicle can be taken up to the place where the steps for trek start. There are proper steps till you reach top. There is lot of walking on the top. It's beautiful at the top with clouds running across.
125,Intersting drive up and good climb and great views,"We went there in the month of November 2016 it was very pleasant and sunny day.We have two families with kids (age from 4 to 11 years) everyone enjoys the trip. This fort is on top of a hill, we climbed steps through Approx 30-40 min the time taken with our kids to get to the top of the fort.  Once you reach the top very beautiful view all side like views of the valleys, visapur fort, and pavana lake. Lovely fort, good view, and Well maintained.  On the top, there places like, Mahadev Temple, Raja Rani Temple, Big Water Storage tank( Hatti talav), Vinchu Kada etc.Please do note that although you can drive down to base Village of Lohagad, but the road up to the fort is extremely narrow, with lots of turns and twists.A Rs 50 parking charges are levied by the gram panchayat for 4 wheelers parking.Note: Monkeys can be seen along the steps so beware of food articles getting snatched from your hands."
126,"Excellent views, wellkept areas",Nice place for a short trek amidst the hills and nature. Be prepared for heavy winds and showers if visiting during monsoon (which is ideally the best time to visit). It's a n amazing experience at the top especially observing the clouds passing by.
127,stairs....stairs...stairs and you reach a view,"Visited just yesterday  along with a friend.  Reached the fort base by car. Last few km Drive from lonavala was bad due to the road condition. Road near fort is bit dangerous, hence be careful while driving.Carry 2/3 bottle of water and some snacks as there is nothing on the way to the top of the fort from basement.Take pictures while climbing since you are fresh and not that tired.  Once you reach the top , you feel exhausted and you don't feel like taking snaps while decending.You don't get to see much of the fort as there is not much remains left.The view from top is mesmerizing one side you can see lonavala city, other side pawana lake and table top (platue).There are few options for eating at the base of the fort.Over all it was a nice trek."
128,Great place and scerene beauty of nature,Everyone travelling to Lonavala must visit this place. It is by far the best place I visited in Lonavala. The climb is a little tiring but it is worth it. The view is awesome and the wind is so strong upstairs that it feels lovely. I loved this place and I strongly recommend people to visit it.
129,Lohagad Fort is located at a great height.,"It was a wonderful trek to Lohagad fort. We went when rains have just started and weather was extremely pleasent. While the road to fort have steep turns, I could drive right upto the place from where steps started. When reached at top, we were lost in the thick clouds.We enjoyed the drizzling, had tea and then returned."
130,Not worth the exertion,Visited this place in Aug during a rainy day... the place is ok no so great.... authorities need to pay attention on the fort as stairs are not in good shape and tracking becomes risky on given day...
131,Excellent weekend destination for tracking,around 300 steps to climbawesome beauty from top levelcombination of ladder & rough stones road can be climbed easily
132,Beautiful view from the top,Lohagad is a simple yet a little long trek. We visited in the month of September in the middle of rainy season and it was absolutely breathtaking to watch this fort in such an awesome weather. There are around 500 steps(well as they say) to the top of the hill. The scenes up there are amazing and mild rainfall is just icing on the cake. One can easily spend 2-3 hours trekking and roaming around this huge mountain fort. A must visit if you're in a mood of short trek and sightseeing.
133,good place if you like old forts,"Excellent trek up to an amazing fort with water bodies, remnants of old cannons, etc. The steps are not difficult and the lassi on the way helps keep one hydrated. But suggest everyone carries a bottle of water. The view from the fort is breathtaking and one can see the Pauna Lake lying lazily below. Signages are lacking especially in English and this if erected discreetly, would make it even more enjoyable."
134,a good trek,Its very difficult and poor road to reach to fort. Our driver was worried about car skiding. But views on top are beautiful.
135,One of the most maintained forts I have visited around Pune,"Located in the outskirts of Lonavala, this place is a great trekking opportunity. You don't want to go via car as the road is not great. Visiting on a bike is fun as you need to ascend several turns. Visit the place and enjoy the peace but dont spoil the place and litter around"
136,Historical place....worth to trek,"Fantastic views from the top all around the ghats (mountain ranges in west Maharashtra). We happened by chance to go up when there was a huge  Urs (religious) going on (annual festival to honour a Sufi saint who has his mausoleum on the fort). Devotees were offering excellent free food eg Mutton Biryans, mutton curries.We missed the day they had an overnight Qawali (raucous sufi music with strong beats) session."
137,Especially For Nature Lover_Lohagad Fort,"when I was in 10th we friends decided not to go via road we decided to take a walk by the mountain side like sihagad has one path to go up. but lohagad was not having one but still, we go on moving till we got a huge vertical mountain  and we stoped there and came back to home. If you want to enjoy just go and explore it randomly it will be great fun"
138,Difficult road,"If you love trekking historical places, then it is recommended. This ford reminds the times of chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. View from the fort is mesmerising."
139,Infectious Energy,Breathtaking view from top so don't stop in between. Must visit fort if you are fond of archaeology and history. Avoid afternoons as if gets very hot.
140,Beautiful view,Lohagad fort is a nice place. We visited during october 2016. It was raining. We literally walked along clouds. Visibility was poor. But the fort was breathtaking with all flowers with full glory and water every where.
141,Natures Beauty,"We visited the forte during independence day weekend with family and friends. It is about 30 minutes away from lonavala market by road. You have to climb about 150 to 200 steps to reach the forte which is situated on hill. Some of steps are very high. They become slippery also during rainy season. As you climb up, you can get fantastic view of surrounding areas covered with lush green grass. Some areas are very narrow during climbing especially at main gate of forte where jam can happen between ascending and descending people. Many steps are broken also. Once you reach on the top, you will forget all the pain by viewing the magnificent landscapes all around with large pavana lake filled with water. Top area is very large and itself is covered with fresh grass during monsoon. Best place to take photos and selfies too. Beware of quickly changing weather conditions and be prepared for thunderstorms. Going down on old stairs with ongoing rain becomes risky especially in holiday season rush and young children. Get yourself treated with hot corn and crispy onion pakodas after coming down from nearby vendors."
142,Fort,Well monsoon is a season of trekking and everyone loves to grab their backpack and go trekking and some adventures.I was here with some of my friends for trekking and bike riding as we left from my home on bikes.Everyone loves to ride on pune mumbai old highway as the road was as soft as cream and for the bikes it is just heaven.But in monsoon we need to take take precautions while riding as it gets a bit harder on such roads in monsoon.We had a plan of one day trek for which we left early in the morning and plan was to leave by the afternoon and reach home by evening.
143,Beautiful view from top,"Great place ,worth the climb, but ride is costly as the auto rickshaws ask for 1000 rupees upto there. Wear comfortable clothing and carry water as its quite high.Light drizzle would be good as the view would be good as well climb won't be too difficult. Teens would enjoy it."
144,Ancient world festooned by floral greenery!,We went early morning to avoid weekend rush. The steps are steep but its non slippery and safe. We loved the water gushing on the stairs while you navigate through it. The top is very windy.
145,"Lohagad Fort Lonavala,MH India","It was a day trip from mumbai , took almost 2n halve hr to reach. 30 min approx climb and you are at the top of the fort. We took almost 2 hrs exploring the fort ..the view is scenic the air is fresh and body fully charged up after the climb. Do carry ample water and snacks. U will not regret it...take the tour when the moon soon is on"
146,Serenity at its best,"A beautiful historical place amidst the forest. More than the the place it  is the nature that will attract you. If you visit Lohgad in a monsoon weekend, please remember it would be a bit crowded, so try leave early to get a safe car park. Although car goes till top, the road is steep and rough. But the real fun is climbing the mountain in pouring rains."
147,You have to be an athlete to reach it.,It's just 45 km away from pune. A good place to send time with family or friends. We can see beautiful scenic beauty around the fort.
148,Great,"Saw reviews and selected this place to visit in Dec, 2013. Since then i visit every year. Its beauty lies in watching the Sun rise from top of the Fort. That means by 6 A.M u must be on top of the fort. It takes 30 mins to drive to Lohagad road from lonavala city centre but it takes at least 1 hour to climb the steps of the fort(but worth). Dark fort walls is covered with brown grass is the beauty of this fort. Professional photographers can grab best pictures at this place.Best time to visit: July-December(raining season preferably)"
149,Most easy,This is a moderately strenuous walk with the reward of great views at the top. We went in monsoon time so it was slippery in places where steps had deteriorated but manageable for most people. Definitely worth a visit and stacks up well vs the other forts I have visited.
150,Nice and easy slice of history,"Maharashtra is dotted with several forts which are a trekker's delight. From easy, medium, tough and super-tough options in-terms of difficulty, one can explore the forts. Lohgad particularly is a medium category trek with some magnificent views. The tip of the fort gives the best view - however, reaching there is little risky as there is a narrow passage with deep slopes on both sides. Wind can be your real enemy at time. Best time to visit is start of monsoon when there is little rain."
151,Tiring but worth it!,"Super green in the monsoon. Beautiful montage of clouds, greenery, blue sky, water and hills. Weather fluctuates beautifully - there is a nice cool breeze at the top.Practical tips -- Driving time is 2.5-3 hours from Mumbai- Google Maps has the right location, so you can use it to navigate- There is a 30-minute climb from the bottom to the top of the hill, where the fort is- At the top of the hill is a large open green area, where you can walk around - there are a few monuments - it could take up to 2 hours to see the entire area if you want to relax and see it at leisure."
152,Awesome rain trip,"First of all the fort is picturesque!! The view from almost top till where we went twice is awesome. Good place for Photography.But.... There is a 7 out of 10 chance that you will be attacked by monkeys. When we started the climb, a couple with kid we rushing down after going about 1/4 distance. They had stones in their hands to throw at the monkey (this doesn't work by the way. It aggravates the monkeys further). We went ahead anyway. Another group of college guys were running down after loosing their lunch to monkeys. This time we were considering returning. And 2 middle aged men came down saying they went to the top and everything is ok. (Probably because they were not carrying anything along) A mind with mixed reviews and the feeling that it would feel stupid to return after coming this far we went ahead. For quite some time there was no monkey around. When we almost reached top people again said don't go ahead. This time we listened. Came back almost to the bottom of the fort. Now someone suggested to use a stick to scare them (doesn't work either). We went till almost top once again. This time about 15 people were surrounded by monkeys and stuck on other side and were on the verge of loosing their bags. We immediately started going down. After covering 1/3 distance a monkey followed us. (It takes them 1-2 seconds to catch up with the tail and all they still have). We were stuck in a narrow stairway. It was scary. When we tried to scare them with the stick it gave a charging stance. THEY ARE NOT SCARED OF HUMANS. Luckily some people joined us who were climbing up. And some were also running down. That monkey was outnumbered. We ran down with everyone and were safe. Please understand monkeys are intelligent and good enough evolved. Plus they have 4 times upper body strength and can move in any direction. Most importantly they are extremely aggressive.Tourists risk getting hurt and loosing belongings. I was disappointed that the people who charge 50 rs for car parking don't even warn you. If u still want to go (really?), go in large group to outnumber the monkeys (I don't know the total up there), don't carry anything (food, camera etc) and do a basic search on videos of how to handle monkeys (no eye contact is suggested in wiki how). Best of luck!"
153,Difficult but manageable trek,"It was an impromptu visit which we had planned to this fort with friends.It's located at Karla in lonavala.The road leading to the fort is small but very scenic.I will recommend to visit this fort in monsoon as the weather is very good.Its not a big climb and there was lot of rains and wind when we visited the top of the fort.While climbing do savour the hot wada pav which they have to offer you at a charge of  Rs 20.There are monkeys on the way,dont mess with them.Overall it was a very good experience."
154,18th century Fort and Green lust grasses ,"Very easy to climb, it is only 400 stairs to see the mind blowing view, lots of monkeys are there be careful with eatables, don’t take it out, if you open anything then you have to give those item to monkey. In the base of the fort you will get Maggie, vada pav, cool drinks, bread omelet and water. Bathroom facility is available in the base of the fort on payable basis. On the top well and small ponds are there, but water will not be good. On the top you will get lime juice."
155,Loved trekking in the rains!Views are absolutely amazing,It is quite a hike to reach the topmost point of the fort.There are total 4 darwajas to reach the top.Shivaji Maharaj kept the gold which he took away from Surat in this fort which was again looted by British.The view from top is very calm and amazing.
156,Stunning views during monsoon,It has around 400 stairs but will find really nice views around it. Top view is really awesome..must go place
157,Great historic value,"Post heave breakfast we went for Lohgarh fort. The last few kms are quite steep so check the car you are planning to use. Once there we started the climb. There was a big group of hikers from all over Maharashtra doing all the forts in that area over three days. We climbed till 2/3d of the way, post that 2 of us with kids stopped and others went ahead. Very good view throughout the climb, good sneakers and stamina required. There were lot of monkeys on the way and you need to be careful and cannot eat there.Eateries at the starting point are quite good with local dishes and we had heavy snacks as we skipped our lunch."
158,Trekkin was tiring,"Amazing 360 degree views from the top of the fort! Short drive from Lonavala, pass the Vedic Heritage Inc Ashram and park your vehicle at the bottom of the fort where the 360 plus steps begin! Quite an easy trek, and enjoy the different Darwazas  you pass - including Ganesh Darwaza and Hanuman Darwaza! A few monkeys to keep you entertained are always there! Once you get to the top, you will enjoy the breathtaking views!"
159,Good fort for trekking,"We went there during monsoons.It was pouring heavily that morning.Once we reached we waited down in a shack and had a light breakfast of tea and maggie while waiting for the rains to subside.That restaurant opened up quite early.Once the rains were a little lighter, we started our trek.The views are absolutely breathtaking!Lot of fog as we went higher, but as even the foot of the fort is on a height, we had beautiful views of the surrounding areas.This place is easy to reach- it can be located on google maps as well.We drove upto the base.There is a strech where there a lot of monkeys sitting , so make sure you are not carrying any food in your hand,anyways there are restaurants below, so food is not an issue.Even the trek is great comprising of steps, so chances of slipping in the rains was minimal.Climbing at leisurely pace will take around an hour(we stopped a lot for a photos)."
160,Awesome fort for trekking,Best time to visit is in the winters. good place to relax and rejuvenate. stayed overnight nearby. had good Maharashtran food from one of the very accommodating villager's home
161,Awesome Place,This best picnic spot near Lonavala....it is completely nice....bhaja caves and near waterfall and visapur fort
162,An awesome trek during monsoons ,Lohagad fort is a good visit. You can choose to trek the entire length. Cars go until the foot of the hills. There are steps to the fort. I visited along with family. The climb was a bit risky in the rain and me carrying my little one. The view on the top is great. Has a small pool for those who wish to get wet.
163,Must visit place in lonavala ,"Lohagad fort has an impressive fort walk, to reach which one has to ascend a series of steps.... Located on the outskirts of Lonavala, once one reaches the top, you get a beautiful view of the lake and Lonavala"
164,Medium level trek,visited in the before we goes to the hotel and its waste of timenothing special and also its too inside to go
165,best place,"About 45min climb to the top, its not a veryyy challenging trek. View from the top is nice. Not much to eat/drink on the way, carry your own stuff. About 20km from Lonavla."
166,Great walk and views,"A great place full of Indian History and the Beauty of the Maharashtran Montains around Lonavala. I'm from Switzerland and i was impressed by the Beauty of the nature surounding the Fort. great views. and also for a bit elder People still possible to ""climb"" up. it is worth it! try to go weekdays, it is less crowded then."
167,Lohagad Fort- Fort of Maratha Empire,Great place to visit in Monsoon season...once you reach your destination...on the top of the Lohagad...there is a beautiful view awaiting you....and if it's raining then it's an add on...
168,Lohgad Trekking ,"It's a good fort to visit with friends, we enjoyed a lot. The views from fort was amazing and as the guide told about it's historical story we felt great to be there."
169,popular historic structure,Lovely fort nearby Pune. the trek is very easy and would not take more than 30 minutes to climb to the top. Structure is very strong just as the name suggest. Carry your food as there are no nearby restaurants etc.
170,Proud feeling,It has some 400 steps.. Need Tao have proper shoes to climb since it can get slippery.. But the view from the top is amazing .. Lots of monkeys around.l.
171,Historic views,"This fort is on top of a hill. I guess there are almost 500 steps to reach to top. I was with my wife and kids. As you climb up you will get very good vies of the below. I had to return back from middle as my wife and small kid both got tired in the mid way. We took some snaps in there and returned back. Its entrance closes by 5.30 pm, so make sure you reach bottom of it before 5 pm ."
172,Ecstatic in monsoon if you start early trek,"Historically this is an amazing place, very beautiful place to go on a weekend. Prepare your sunblock and legs, a lot of places you will be under the sun and going up and down without a lot of help.Also there are monkeys trying to sell food at the entrance.My biggest complain is: trash everywhere. Literally everybody just throw trash everywhere there (and even if there is trash bin, nobody cares...). There is a ""entry charge"" there which is clearly useless (what they are doing with that money? The place is still super dirty, safety is not good....nothing comes out of that)"
173,Trek to lohagad,Lohagarh fort has good eating joints at the base to relish yourself before the climb.=>Carry light as there's lot to climb.=>Proper shoes with good grip is       suggested. =>There are spots which would serve as good sun set point but be careful valley is steep and deep.=> No directions=>No proper railings so careful guys..=> Vinchu Katya (scorpion tail) is a must visit hurry up to top and go to the right.=>For Bhajan caves:--Proceed down the road which brought you to lohagad... -The road will narrow down and end up with a ghat downwards. Follow the road till you see the caves on the right side in a mountain. The road will take you to bhaja village..-Bhaja village is a good small village with friendly villagers you can get good food over there as well- there is a staircase towards bhaja caves which starts near the road.. ask villagers for proper directions....Cheers!!!
174,Awesome trekking but very crowded on weekends ,"Firstly,Exotic Nature view journey and secondly so hygienic and clean well maintain also.....it worth to go atleast one timeJourney with train to reach Lohagad FortSo our journey was started from Mumbai,Dadar we catch train 6.50 a.m Intercity Exp and reached to lonavala around 8.30 a.m from there we catch local train 10.10 am and reach to Malavli(next Station from Lonavala) it hardly take 10 minutes from lonavala from Malavli station we walk down for 5 minutes and took local cab(Mr.Dharmendra ji) Mob no:-9764814653 he is a very nice person not even he helps us to reach there but also guide so wellfinally we reached Lohagard fort around 11.30 a.m and we are on the top within 1.30 hr and guys what a VIEW seriously cant describe so so beautiful worth it those who are nature lover and totally family place. all after this we come down 5 p.m and had some food from down dhaba type restaurant and again we took same cab for reached to Malavli station from we catch local train and reached to lonavala from their we catch 7.23 p.m Indrayani Exp.....So thats it ............nice place"
175,Good Place With Reverse waterfall in rains,"Lovely fort. Good setting, good view n a must go. Well maintained. Monkey sighting along the steps so beware of food articles getting snatched from your hands. Carry a stick to scare them away. My son was trilled when he reached the fort and touched the flag flying high. It made him ask many questions about our history n why forts were built. A good start at 7 years of age."
176,History with bueaty,"A superb place to be in this fabulous season of monsoon. Try to be there on weekdays & you'll be left with such a mesmerising nature without getting disturbed by the crowd. Going up is beat tricky especially in monsoon as there are some passages which get slippery but otherwise it's a nice experience. Once you are up, you'll find a huge ground with a small shiv temple & number of water bodies with clouds passing through. A must be place if you're in Lonavala!"
177,the best,visited their wid a trek tourism group.. it was good made good friends and the palce was also very good.
178,Easy trek but quite crowded,"Lohagad Fort is high and mighty. It overlooks Lavassa. Once atop, you'll see ponds and broken structures - mostly because of non-maintenance! Go for it predominantly as a trek, it's not the most touristy place in Lonavala!"
179,Good and realtively easy trek,"This is a supernice trip approximately 45 mins from Lonavala centre. The road to Lohagad Fort is steep and not so pleasant, but the site is well worth the trip. NB: weekends are very busy here - best time to visit is Mon-Thu. At the starting point there are several small stands who sell the usual crisps and cookies. During our visit there was ongoing work with maintaing the stairs and path leading to the top. A lot of stones are not really well attached to the walls, and you will have to look after your kids well. And do watch your own steps too!Safety leaves a lot to wish - there are no fences or barriers to protect you from falling down the walls. You’d better stick to the prepared path. On the top is a small temple. Take of your shoes if you want to enter the area in front of temple. Views are stunning!"
180,Nice fort to climb,"Lohagad Fort Lonavala, MH India is a good place to trek. i would say a bit difficult trek if you want to reach the end. We had been in the late afternoon. We reached the top of the fort in a hour time. Then we decided to reach the end of the fort which is little difficult & very slippery when wet. After we reached the end point it rained heavily thunder storm for about 20 mins or so we got totally drenched in rain . So climbing back on the rock was difficult as it was slippery and water fall created due to storm water, the railing are broken at this point so you have to be careful not to slip & fall from the rock. rest of the place is easy with steps to climb & get down comfortably. It was adventure in the heavy thunder storm. We reach back to the parking in 3 hours time. there is no entrance fees to this fort .you only have to enter in the book that you visited ."
181,Merge with the locals,"It is a tough climb @ 500 steps which are uneven, broken and with high rise. If you are interested in history do visit with a guide. It offers fantastic view all around. Carry your water/food supply with you. At the summit do see the temple, dargah, lake, horse stable place and the cave where they kept the treasure from Surat. Appealing place for history lovers."
182,"Simple, awesome and good place to visit...!","I visited this fort in 1990 & most recently yesterday.It was a pleasant surprise for me to see that this fort has undergone excellent development. The Government has transformed the real trek fort into a family trek fort now thru the development of making steps from the foothills to the top of fort. It takes 20 to 30 minutes from foothill to fort main entrance at top. More than one hour to see complete fort.Fortunately, entry is free. Parking fee;2 wheeler Rs. 204 wheeler Rs. 50Bus Rs.80Timings are 7 am to 5.30 pmFort map is there at the foothills at start of the trek.One government staff at main entrance on top & two government staff on the fort, to monitor entry & exit of visitors within time.At foothills, there is a good parking space, couple of restaurants with lodging facility.Few village women are selling snacks, lemon juice & butter milk, corn etc on steps.On route, couple of monkeys available.Route & distance from Pune.Pune Vishrantwadi to Lohagadh Fort - 73 kmThe total road condition is very good using Pune Mumbai old highway till Shivaji chowk. The further road from Shivaji to Lohagadh is also very good.a) Pune Visharantwadi to Shivaji chowk junction before Kamshet village - 47 kmTake left turn from Shivaji chowk junction to road going to Pawna dam, lohgadh, tikona etcb) Shivaji chowk junction to Lohagdh fort - 32 kmFollow the sign board on road. On reaching Pawna dam, the right side road leads to LohagadhWhile on this road you will be able to see following forts;Tikona - to your leftTunggadh as well as Pawna dam - in frontLohagadh - to your rightVisapur - to your extreme right next to LohagadhNB: If doubt exist in your mind at any junction, please ask before proceeding so as to ensure being on right route instead of driving on wrong route without asking.It will take more than one hour to stroll at your leisure to see the scenic picturesque views all around the fort providing very very beautiful & magnificent views of mountains & water bodies.At the top, there are sign boards telling the names of the various historical spots on the fort.Time to visit;WinterRainEarly in the morning in summerThe best one day plan is;a) Visit Bedse cavesb) Visit Pawna lakec) Visit Prati Pandharpurtd) Visit LohagadhThis fort is right on top in my list of forts that provides most magnificent spectacular views.Please do see the attached photos in this review to give you the feel of how you will see the fading scenery during summer. Hope the reader finds above information helpful to trip to this fort.Wish you all the best."
183,Extremely crowded on weekends,"This fort is in ruins but its an excellent place to visit if you can shut you eyes to the irascible crowd all around you, mostly dominated by young, i-dont-care attitude people. The top of the  fort is easy to reach and can be done by elder people as well , provided they do not have leg pain or heart problems. If historical architecture interests you, then you can see some of the remains there and can conjure up your own vision of the life there in yester year. Once you reach the top, you see wonderful views all around , lots of space to enjoy your time. Do visit in monsoon when the greenery is superb. Please DO NOT dirty this place like others do.I have seen youngsters making merry in the pond at the top, shouting as if they own the place, throwing bottles and wrappers wherever they feel like. This is what we do in India to show that we have visited some place. So please , if you read my review, do not do anything that can ruin the peace and beauty of this place and make travelers like me feel dejected because of inhumane attitude.Enjoy the walk to the top, sit there, soak in the nature."
184,Great fort!,"A lot of stairs are to be climbed to reach the top of the fort, which offers scenic views. There are a couple of small temples on the top. Climb the fort when the weather is pleasant so that you can escape the scorching sun."
185,Lohgad Fort trek,"In case you are mesmerized by those pictures of Lohagad fort and intended to enjoy the scenic beauty, there is a caveat that you probably didn't take into account bunch of youths and others who keep shouting and making noises all through the way and on its top, taking away the peace and tranquility which is otherwise there. I visited the fort on 15th August, so probably it was overcrowded but otherwise, it's a good view from top and experience would be better if visited on a day with probably less crowd. Going to the top of the fort and hearing noises and screams from people around, eating away the beautiful silence is just disappointing."
186,Loh gadh ..,"This place is easily accessible from Lonavla. Went there with friends, although it was raining it wasn't much of trouble visiting this place. Best is if you read a bit about the fort of prehistoric era on Google before you visit. You can trek up, it's not a very difficult trek."
187,Easy Must visit monsoon paradise,Its a must visit place in Lonavala. Its a 30-40 min trek from the bottom to the top. And the view is stunning from every corner. In rainy season a rain coat is a must because Umbrella won’t work because of the heavy wind. In summer carry water bottle with you and please don’t carry food because you might attract monkeys unknowingly.
188,Nice climb on the fort,"I went to Lohgad on 4th Feb 2018 with my car. Guys if you are going by car then do not go from Malavli side.Reason:The road is very much narrow, two vehicles at a time cannot go.steep U turns immediately one-after anotherIt is not made as per standard norms So driving is very much risky from Malavli side. Please avoid it, if you are a city driver. or even difficult for skilled drivers.For safety, you should and must go from Pavna side, through Lonavla city."
189,Beautiful sight sightseeing,Had great time with my friends.One needs an experienced driver to be there through ghats.should visit that place.
190,Awesome place,"Good place for trekking with beautiful views on the way, advised to start trekking early in morning. Steep incline way avoid big vehicles."
191,Easy Trek...beautiful view!!,This fort is a really good place to trek .An easy and beautiful trek. How to reach from Mumbai : get down at lonavla.catch another local from lonavla towards pune. 8 mins from lonavla (train)From Pune:Catch local towards Lonavla and get down at Malavlicross the railway crossing and walk for 5 km or Hire a cab pay 70 bucks and reach the base.
192,Perfect trek on a rainy day,"Lohgadh is around 5 kms from Malawli station, which is just ahead of lonavla.   It is an easy trek. Ideal for amateur trekkers like me. The climate was quite pleasant with mild showers at regular intervals. There is a small waterfall near the foothills of Lohgadh. We spent some time at the waterfall before proceeding further. We started our way up the fort. A fortnight of rain had changed the surroundings considerably. The lush green carpets were quite soothing for eyes. After around an hour or so, we reached the Lohgadh village. Fort has around 400 stairs but will find really nice views around it. A top view is really awesome. The original fort was built in the 12th Century by Raja Bhoj. Later on, it was brought into Swaraj by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and he used it for keeping his treasury. The steps to the fort were rebuilt during his time.Since it was raining heavily, at times the visibility was hardly a few meters. We were traversing along the boundary of the fort. At one point there was a stream of water flowing down the wall of the fort. But as the wind was blowing against us, the water was flowing back again giving an impression of a waterfall flowing in reverse direction. Great trek for a day...!"
193,Nice architecture with beautiful scenery ,We took a day trip here from Mumbai - allow 6 hours travel time there and back The way up to the fort is via a lot of steps - 54 flights from Fitbit The fort is very well defended and had commanding views around the area - the whole of the top of the mountain was part of the fortifications and even that would have been had to fight over due to the shape of a scorpions tail over the land The path to the far end is not easy if you are not ok climbing over rocks Well worth visiting Facilities very basic this is not a frequent tourist stop !
194,Lohagad Fort,"We visited Lohagad in August and it was an awesome experience. Its a nice 500-600 step trek to the top of the Fort. You’ll find small waterfalls en route to the top.After that you can visit places at the top like vinchukada etc. There’s a small temple at the top as well. At the top you’ll get breathtaking views of nature, especially when its monsoon. Just remember to take your raincoat as its quite windy at the top and an umbrella won’t work"
195,Amazing view - Stamina required!!!,"I went to this fort last week with my friends for a bike ride the road from pune to lohagad fort is very good and has got a lot of scenic beauty, reach to fort before 4 pm as it is not allowed to enter in fort after 5 pm and it has got a  small trekk and a number of small ans medium waterfalls.Also it is convinient to reach via train but one has to walk from railway station of the fort as no other convince available It was good experience  going there, a must visit place near pune"
196,Fantastic view ,"This place is really on serious height. One must consider his/her physical health before even starting to attempt climbing the stairs. But the hustle that you go through to reach at the top is worth it when you witness the view from the top, it is fabulous and breathtaking. I would highly recommend you to visit this fort if you are in Lonavla."
197,Very nice views,"It is a nice fort for trekking, outing. It isn't having any sort of museum up there. Best to visit is in Rainy reason. Views from the top are cool. It is good place to spend time with your family or your loved one especially if you both enjoy adventure, nature"
198,Only good place from all the places we visited in lonavala,Carry more than sufficient water and cnacks from the base as nothing available at top.Views are amazingTry tekking as early as possible in morning as it will be more tiring as the day progressesIt will take min 3 hrs to complete the trip above.Lohagad fort should be the first point of the day fr visit.
199,Trekking,Try to reach in the morning to start your trek and to be back after enjoying sunset. It is good one day trek surrounded by beautiful view and natural beauty.  On the top you find Temple and awesome views. Good for photography lovers. You can enjoy the 360 degree views of surrounding places. Be careful while trekking as the steps near the top are very slippery specially during the rainy season. Spend some time at the top and enjoy. No facility is available at this place so be careful of any fall .
200,A part of history worth visiting,route: lonavala-malvali railway station-lohagad..its 1 hour trek from base village. don't prefer autos from malvali railway station. they will drop middle of route. views are too good and less trek. best time to visit: july-oct
201,""" Very nice view in the top of this fort""","Its about a 30 min walk to the top. On the way up you can see some great views, topped only by the views at the peak. Be aware of monkeys around this place. Carry water, will help with the climb."
202,Test your stamina,"been there in April month, started at 6:30 in morning, went up via stairs, so it was not so tough.just at top there is no shelter if its rain or too hot weather."
203,Lohagad Fort,"We hired a local taxi to take us to Lohaghad and Baja Caves. He charged us Rs 3000 for 5 hours in a 7 seater Ertiga.  The road is quite steep and bad in certain stretches, it's advisable not to take your own car. As we went there during the monsoons the steps are quite slippery so please wear proper shoes with a good grip. The view from the top is simply fantastic. It's extremely windy so an umbrella is of no use. The reverse waterfall is truly a unique natural phenomenon which occurs only during the monsoon season due to the wind condition."
204,waste of time,"We started early in the morning from Pune. If you are going to visit Lohgad then start early. You should be there around 7:00AM to avoid traffic jam problems. One can start from Malavali station and keep walking towards Bhaje village. Place is close by and one can find people walking with you. After Bhaje village keep moving towards Lohagad fort visible. Don't stop at Bhaje caves or at waterfalls. On the way back you can enjoy it. This is due to small roads with huge traffic during pick time. After Bhaje village if one is driving then driver should be experienced good enough as there are steep slopes. If you are walking there there are no words to describe feelings. It's just awesome and breathtaking. Nature at its best in rainy season. Enjoy local breakfast like vadapav, bhaji, Bhurjee with hot tea..!At Lohagad base village people are friendly. Car parking charges are 50 Rs per car. They will guide you and will take care of your car. Lohagad is not difficult at all and it hardly takes 20 minutes to reach on the top. In rainy season wow water flows from steps and looks cool. Doors are well maintained. Be careful...monkeys all over the fort. Don't look and play with them. Just ignore and enjoy. No food on the top so make sure to have your food in bag with you. It's windy, foggy on the top. Keep place hygienic. Don't through waste. You will find dustbins in between. With good memories leave to enjoy waterfalls and Bhaje caves....!"
205,High but rich in history,"Lohagad Fort is an impressive construction, certainly worth a visit particularly if you want to do this as a trekking activity.It can be accessed via Malavli rail station. From the station, it is about 2km until the entrance of the Bhaja caves (easy walk) and then 4km (steep climb) until the entrance of the fort via a paved road. Lots of people walk up there. The entrance can also be accessed by car (paid card park at the top) if you do not want to walk, and there are drivers that will take you up there from the Bhaja caves car park.Plenty of restaurants and food stalls at the entrance. No facilities up there (just s small stall selling water and some food). It is a steep climb via steps, some places can be a bit slippery so good hiking shoes are recommended. Not a place to go with flip flops or shoes with high heels. During the climb, you will see plenty of monkeys around the stone walls. They will try and steal your food so keep anything you have to eat in your backpack.After you arrive at the top in the open space, it is safer to eat as monkeys will stay near the walls. Fantastic views from there. If you get low clouds, you may not have full visibility but it adds to the atmosphere.Definitely worth a visit during monsoon season. Other times of the year, it must be a hard climb due to the heat."
206,Place with an wow effect,"Good place to visit for one/half a day picnic with friends.Easy to trek and roam around the fort. vehicles can be parked at the basement.Better to go early in the morning for enjoying sunrise. It also makes trekking easier in the morning hours as compared to afternoon.The road till the basement is average and one has to be little careful. From highway/railway station (Malvali), walking would distance would be about 8 kms.After going to top, a small temple, a mosque, a big plateau are seen. One can spend few hours for sure.Better season to visit would be sept to dec."
207,Trek level - Easy,"The best place to be, complete natural extravaganza. I visited during July 2016 and the place was fully crowded with people of all age group and from almost every part of Country. It takes a tiring journey to realize the feel of awesomeness once you reach To of the fort. The best part upon reaching was the cloudy and windy view.Shiva has marked his presence up on that hill too.A trek down to the Bhaja Cave/Malavli is full of fun. Lots of stalls are also placed by localites. Its worth walking. It is totally a trekking trip so one should be ready for that awesome experience.Visited: July 2016"
208,Good Place to view,Was there with my friends during the monsoon season. It was raining but this made the entire scene more pleasant. The sky was full of clouds and it seemed we were walking among the clouds. The lush green valleys were awesome. Beautiful views of the mountains.
209,Trek ending in clouds,The Lohagad trek is a must-do activity if you are in Lonavala. It takes around 5 hours to complete the full trek. I am a lousy trekker so we trekked only up to Ganesh Darwaza which takes around 30-45 mins; the steps are clean and well maintained till Ganesh Darwaza and then become steep. It may get slippery during the monsoon. Do carry some water and snacks along. The view on top is beautiful. There are many monkeys and dogs around. But they are harmless. The entry fee is Rs 25 for Indians and Rs 300 for foreigners. Timings are from 9 AM to 5.30 PM.
210,BEAUTIFUL VIEW FROM TOP,if you have a group of adveture excited peoples then you must visit here.. its not so far from bhakti shakti nigdi bus stop... best way to go ..is via mumbai pune express highway .. bike is preferable.
211,Nice place to visit,"Best for beginning trackers or girls as well only around 1 hr track with stair so not very exiting, easily assailable by local train, near by station is Malavli"
212,Lovely strenuous walk from the Lohagad village below the fort,"We four family members out of that three are ladies and we all are senior citizens, trekked the fort  it is around 3400 ft.hight..we stepped the steps and reached to the top of the fort, we seen small pond, lake before we reached top, I think near Ganesh gate. The water was cool and clean. At the top ,there is Shiv temple, Bhavani mataji temple, Lake, and 360 degree view of the mountains nearby and also seen pawana \Bhusi dem...from the top of the fort. The steps on the top are very slippery so one has to be very careful,  you must have time atleast 3-4 hours to spend there to see the nature beauty.If the government starts maintaining various steps and wall which are already damaged then many tourists can enjoy very well. Also, there is no First Aid treatment there or nearby so many tourists if they injured due to slippery steps,they fell down there is no medical aid is available there , which is required must.Otherwise it is very nice place to enjoy for trekking and nature beauty."
213,Loved it,I visited this place in the month of march in the evening time.. the weather was quite pleasant the views were good and the road to reach there is quite difficult. But local people are helpful so don't worry.
214,What a view,"- Great trek up the hill- Steps all the way to the big plateau on the top- Great views from the top- Do not miss the highest point on the plateau- Suitable for children as along as they behave themselves and obey accompanying adults, need to be careful as some points can be dangerous- Best time to visit: winter"
215,Must visit...,"During the monsoon, the top of the fort is covered with mist and clouds and becomes particularly wet with growing moss. The roads and trails leading to the hill are quite slippery at this time of the year and precautions are necessary to be taken while venturing the routes."
216,Awesome place to visit,only the fit and if u have time and adventuours go there and interested in historic places. the facilites shoudl be more there then its will be worth going
217,Nice fort but not fully maintained,Wear comfy shoes and visit only if u have strong knees. 500+ old stairs and you get mesmerised by the beauty of the view. Kids get afraid of the monkeys at times. there are a plenty on your way to the top. not really well kept like various other forts we have visited in the past.
218,Steps towards divine scenes,This is a really a awesome place to see. As it is now well maintained now . The steps are very good to climb with out any panic. The view from the top is un believable with a wonderful blow of air. Must visit it once
219,Nice place to trek,15 km from Lonavala station. One has to just keep following the road towards pawna lake and after 15 km there is a slight diversion to left which will take you to the fort. One can opt to park vehicle besides the road or take it till the base of fort where you get paid parking. View from the top is awesomePros:Good 360 deg view from topIn rains clouds cover the topWalk till the scorpion's tail is awesomeGreenery all aroundEasy gradient for everyoneCons:Slippery in rainsNo stalls at the topRemote location
220,Adventurous uphill hike!,One must visit to know how fit his health. Fort visit timings are 7/30 am to 5/30 pm. Breathtaking view from top so don't stop in between
221,Mind blowing after rainy days on 15th Oct 2016,"One must visit to know how fit his health. Fort visit timings are 7/30 am to 5/30 pm. To reach, roads are not good but worth to conquer."
222,Fun trek and awesome views from the top,A must visit place .. this climb includes all steps only.. it maybe difficult but the view makes it all payoff.. this place opens at 7am and closes at 6pm ensure to give at least 1hr on the top to enjoy the views
223,Climb damp near killed me,We trekked up the Lohgad and Visapur forts in Lonavala and had a fantastic experience overall. It was raining heavily throughout our journey and we had to climb up waterfalls. Once you reach the peak you get an excellent view of the mountains all around. Salute to Mother Nature for being her bountiful best!!
224,Attractive Hill Fort a nice visitation,"Not so difficult track. mild track with stairs all the way, Good local food at the Fort Start point.View was amazing; 2 - 3 ponds at the top; luckily able to see fishes in that pond."
225,Nice if you are interested,"trekking on this route was really amazing. especially, exploring the old lohagad fort during your trek, far away from the hustle and bustle of city,vinchu kada also a nice loved it a lot really."
226,A superb fort to trek just about 40-50 kms from Pune.,"Lohagad fort doesnt offer much other than a nice trek, though there are steps, and decent views once you are at the top. Yes there are monkeys so dont carry eatables in your hand. We were lucky that it was overcast and there were a few spells of drizzle too....the clouds made the whole experience memorable ! However if its sunny i dont think one will have an enjoyable experience since the top is all open ground with no shade. Though mostly the place was clean we did spot some plastic waste left here and there. The least we can do is to stop littering such places !!"
227,Sunday Trip,"It's amazing! Was there with a friend yesterday, sadly we only had 1 hour I think that 2 hours would have been perfect! It's a lovely view, a great fort and we met some nice people there."
228,Good fort close to City,Go for it.. awesome trek.. pls carry water. Loads of sunscreen.Well maintained and not many people as it isnt an easy climb.
229,Cloudy & Windy Hill,It was good to be there with family and friends. It was located on hills and view was awesome from there. Also clouds come down frequently during raining season.
230,Excellent History but Poorly Maintained and No Guides,Its a climb but it's nice if you ahppen to be one of those who are interested in forts.  I found it average
231,Lohagadh trek,It's a serene place. The trek is simple and it's a really good option for the trekkers who're just starting their trekking journey.
232,Superb trek experience !,"If you’re visiting Lonavala and feel a bit adventurous, do check out Lohagad fort. It’s easy to reach by road, just half an hour by car from Lonavala market. The drive up the hill towards the end is beautiful. There are some 400 odd steps to climb till the top. Avoid monsoon as it gets slippery in the rains. A walking stick and drinking water could be useful."
233,Great trek. Great Drive. Great view,"A difficult trek, but the view from top is out of this world. We went with a 3 year old kid who enjoyed the trek and view. There are many lakes which are nice. The fort is quite big and we could not see fully due to lack of time and energy"
234,Good for a 1 day trip,"Climbed up the fort for over 45min with encouraging rains, thoroughly enjoyed. take a help of the local security guard/guide once you reach the top to explain and take you around. Spent over 1 hour seeing the main points"
235,Great fort,"I guess best time would be during winter, the trek to Lohagad was fun in itself, the best part is reaching the top..Its one of the must treks but obviously in group.."
236,Reminds the power of the mighty Marathas,Better have steel in your body as one will have to climb a lot to reach at the top. stunning view from the top good place to capture good pictures and bow to the people in ancient time to build such place.
237,Nice track,"Yes, its a destination where you can track and enjoy... lots of stairs to climb. its a scenic when it rains...Beware of monkeys !!"
238,Breathtaking !!,"I love historic sites and old forts. The Lohagad Fort is just that! on top of that, the view is absolutely amazing! A MUST go."
239,Beautiful fort,We went during the monsoons.. it was raining like buckets.. still had a great time. Trek is easy although the view and surrounding are breathtaking. Beware of monkeys though.. rest all is amazing.
240,Visit to Historic Monument,What a view. Sooo great and peaceful on top. Do explore around on top of the mountain. But beware of monkeys.
241,Good Sceninc View around,"This Fort is an easy trek in today's times, but at some places, you are reminded of why it was such a formidable one. You can reach here from Mumbai by going upto Lonavala & then taking a Lonavala-Pune local to the very next station after Lonavala, Malavali.A little history courtesy Wikipedia - Lohagad has a long history with several dynasties occupying it at different periods of time: Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, Bahamanis, Nizams, Mughals and Marathas. Shivaji Maharaj captured it in 1648 CE, but he was forced to surrender it to the Mughals in 1665 CE by the Treaty of Purandar. Shivaji Maharaj recaptured the fort in 1670 CE and used it for keeping his treasury. This fort was used to keep the loot from Surat. Later in Peshwa time Nana Phadnavis used this fort for living for sometime and built several structures in the fort such as a big tank and a step-well.It is 6 km from the closest station (Malavali) & is accessible by foot. If you decide to walk all the way, you can reach in around 1 & a half hours if you keep a constant pace. Alternatively, you can hire a taxi, which is actually a pick-up truck used to transport cattle. Around 10-15 people are stuffed in like chicken, but you will reach faster. So choice is yours. Also, if you decide to walk all the way, you will most definitely miss out on Bhaje Leni (which are on the way to the fort) as it will not be possible to visit both places in one day. There are locals selling lemon juice & kokam sherbet on the way, which is refreshing. Once on top, there are info boards at various point, however, they only tell you the name of the place/object & do not actually give any information as such. Also, we did see some guides from ASI, but there were only 2 of them. The fort, unfortunately like many others, is in disrepair with people throwing plastic around, feeding the monkeys, smoking cigarettes, the cannons of those times lying around.. This definitely is a negative point. There is an urgent need for repairs & beautification. Once you start exploring, the view is simply breathtaking. There is a spot called Vinchukada (Scorpion's Sting) so that is one place you should visit. There is also a 16 sided well. You can have lunch on your way down at the base of the fort."
242,"Mind Blowing- Early in the morning, Excellent place to watch",Obviously it was tiring for me.. but once on top you are amazed with the cleanliness and the historic importance of this placeIt simply awed me the rooms which wr actually caves and the temple on this fortIts pretty huge and you have to rest on many steps before you reach the topFurther the manmade pond made by shivaji is amazin as it still holds water and is of the size of a football groundWorth the visit for the ones who love trekking
243,Awesome place,Did a quick (1/2 hour) walk up to the main plateau area of the fort. Very few other tourists so it was a very pleasant climb. Breathtaking views.The drive to the fort is somewhat challenging as the roads are fairly narrow once you get closer.
244,Great trek up the hill,"The view from the top was amazing. The place is built from rock mountain. Of course you have to climb the stairs to climb it. But it's not really hard. We went with 2 children and we're fine. In fact I was wearing a flip flop as wasn't expecting to go up in the first place. Somehow the flip flop survived. But if I come again, I think I'd wear proper shoes. We went in November. It was cool and windy inside the fort."
245,Spell bounding Pawna Lake view...,We reached the fort at 11am. The drive was very challenging that's why we decided to take the Jeep to the fort and parked our vehicle at parking near the Malavli railway station. The ride costs 70₹ per head. The view wasn't great as we couldn't see anything because of the thick fog. We need to climb a lot of steps to reach the fort so expect a small trek even after you reach the highest point you can with a vehicle. There are just a few small shops for food. So avoid having a meal near the fort.
246,Trek to the Top,its just a regular cave type fort. nothing special to observe. would not recommend this place. not advisable.
247,small trek and good views,"It had around 500 steps.. Some paths are bumpy and slippery..  Both of my kids (5 and 3years) climbed on their own with excitement..  We climbed during hot sun hence it was more thirsty..  Good view from top..  But you have to be double careful with your kids, there are many places which is dangerous for kids..  There are many small openings in the rock through which a kid can fell off.. It was a nice experience and a must visit place.."
248,For fitness enthusiasts,"Did this on our trip to Lonavala after visiting Karla caves. Reached the place without much of planning and information and turned out to be a good half day exercise. The drive to the top was awesome, if you love driving the winding roads. One you reach the parking area, the climb starts with proper stairs all the way, well almost. Shops are there at the base for cane jiuce/biscuits etc. Most of the climbing was done with my younger one clinching on to us, reluctant to walk up, so was slightly taxing. Climb is straight forward through steps, well maintained. You get good photography points in between with the age old fortress and far off hills. Once you are up the top, you have a small temple  and other structures out there, water bodies etc. One can explore and walk around the vast area and also can climb to the top most hill. On the whole a great place. No food/water available at the top, so carry your own and please take care not to litter."
249,Lohagad best view on top,"It is a perfect location to enjoy scenic views of the greenery and the lake below. Also, as my title suggests, I fell that it is one of the most maintained forts I have visited. It is also one of the easiest treks in and around Pune, being perfect for beginners. One can really and fully enjoy a day at Lohagad Fort at any time of the year."
250,Good family trek! ,"Don't miss it if you are in vicinity and have 3-4 hours of time. It is a beginner level trek, in monsoons it falls into little challenging category, but that is the fun time too to enjoy the fort, trek to top and the overall place."
251,Monkey Menace!!,"So those who have witnessed forts of Rajasthan might be a little disappointed by the size and grandeur but i would suggest its definitely worth watching. The views are breath taking from above. Rains bring the best shades of green in the walls of the fort. However, when we reached on the top the winds and fog was so strong, i could barely stand for a while but what an exceptional experience . Very refreshing. Away from crowd that you will generally find at touristy places. General Information- we went via Pune , so you need to take old Mumbai- Pune highway. you need to take right and reach till base of the fort. The roads from where you take right is not in good condition but still one can manage driving."
252,Legendary fort,Really takes you back in time. The rains make the place so hauntingly beautiful. Hope to go back and visit again on a clear & sunny day
253,its too far and too tought to go there,You have to climb steep stairs to reach there. Difficult for elder people. Even the stones are slippery and you need to be cautious. But what you find there is not worth the trek. Not well maintained...just a  boundary wall and a few ruins. Yes the view of pawna lake from top is very good.
254,Family Trekking !!!,"lohgad attracs visitors with its wide,refreshing waterfalls,an ancient fort,and ofcource,those famous caves a top a steep flight of steps."
255,Mini Trekking,"To get to the top is a relatively easy trek, and is a must visit when in Lonavala. This fort is a delectable piece of history and visiting it can make the imagination run wild as to how it must have been in its full glory centuries ago. The views are stunning and spectacular, and there is gorgeous temple as well as a Dargah on the top. The Shiv Ling is very ancient absolutely unmissable. This is a place I would like to keep going back to every time I go back to Lonavala."
256,Climb up to have a breathtaking view,"You can easily reach the destination with google maps, carry water bottles with you as it was hot. Good luck enjoy"
257,Lovely trip. My 7 year old kid loved to climb the fort.,"This Solo-Trek to Lonavala, started with me getting hold of my emotions and thoughts as a loner. Every weekend I would  dine and watch movies alone, out of boredom just so the void i.e. ""lack of company,  the inability to find new friends and exciting things to do"" could temporarily be filled.Never did i realise, that this phase would take an entire decade to outgrow. Nonetheless,  working late on a Saturday afternoon I decided to look up a few trek sites near Mumbai.The search went on as I looked up videos and travel blogs of thrill-seekers around the country, traveling to such treacherous terrains in peak monsoon periods. It was initially supposed to be a fun getaway, where you walk for hours together to have reached a certain monumental point.Such wasn't the case, when I randomly made up my mind in the midst of a late Saturday night game of cards. There was no looking back as I packed a small saddle bag with a few essentials, making way to the historic Victoria Terminus.The excitement in me grew, as I bought a ticket to Lonavala  having boarded  the Intercity Express to Pune. The general boggy is full of Marathi speaking locals heading either to Pune or places nearby. At first, the train ride isn't all that fun, until you pass Karjat Station. Karjat is a hill station in Maharashtra known for its famous waterfall, besides the farm houses of famous Bollywood celebrities. The journey comes full circle having passed a long tunnel, to be received by the magnanimous and  beautiful algae coated Western Ghat Ranges.The Western Ghats, a range running parallel to the Western coast of the Indian Peninsula called ""The Great Escarpment of India"", houses in it, Majestic forts and waterfalls. On reaching the Lonavala station, the first noticeable thing is the dense fog and strikingly cold weather for a person like me who prefers roaming around in his shorts. The sad state of commuting is such that the auto-rickshaws charge utpo 300 bucks. Nonetheless, if you walk a little further towards the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, you can find shared auto rickshaws charging 15 rupees for the same.The trek to Lohagadh Fort starts with a splendid waterfall with half naked middle aged men bathing and running about their spouses eating corn. Once you ignore this visual, stay put to find a flight of stairs leading to the very famous 2000 year old Karla Caves. One of the Caves,an embodiment of Buddhist piousness nests in it a strikingly beautiful shrine. If the architecture wasn't enough to please you, theres a waterfall flowing right next to where the caves end. Once, you're done pleasing your eyes with the caves,the guard will guide you to a steep route descending to the mouth of a waterfall.Now that things looked easy and pleasing, the unforgiving trek just began with me crossing the current to rappel down the slippery walls of the waterfall. This hill was full of muddy tracks considering the perpetual rains. Sliding is always a better option on these rocks instead of leaping to break a bone. The wild wet adventure to the Lohagadh Fort has a panoramic charm with even higher hills and picturesque waterfalls at each end. Only when you get down, do you realize the genesis of the steep route to the fort.The route to that of the fort, is a winding road with waterfalls on one side and dykes on the other. The view nonetheless, keeps getting better as the climb gets vertiginous. One is greeted by a number of cows and couples on the way, grazing and aimlessly taking selfies amidst the resplendent view in the backdrop. There are thatched hovels on the bends serving vada pavs and corn for a two a penny sum of 30 bucks. These thatched cabins also serve as resting reliefs for the tired trekkers with hot tea giving company.The populace other than trekkers also opt to drive uphill till the foot of the fort. Meanwhile, restless beings like me, who get bored of the usual road start scaling the hilly crooks in search of thrill. Thrill fared well as I ended up next to another splendorous waterfall and an algae laden ditch.Its hard not to plonk yourself and gape at the exquisiteness of mother nature in all eternity.Well then,with the weather flaring up just like the rugged sole of a shoe, we reach the foot of the fort's ascend. Some 10 odd kms coupled with light drizzle and hue bring you to a juncture falling betwixt two colossal Maratha fortifications on either sides.Make way, as we shin up the Lohagad Fort. The base of the fort is crowded with temporary thatch clad restaurants and hawkers selling corn. As I started at the stairs of the garrison, a few moss clad  tombstones inscribed with ""Regulated Area"" caught my eye. This was probably a forewarning of what nature had in store for me at the helm.A total of 400 decrepit and ram-shackled medieval stairs made way to the meridian of Lohagadh Fort. Although, a flight of  stairs may sound convenient, but then the first glance at the condition of this flight made matters seem a little bloodcurdling. The first few steps went well, but dint accoutre me for what was to come next. Embarking on the climb ,""treacherous"" dint remain a mere word anymore. The perpetual rains and cascade thereafter had washed away the clasp, leaving the path battered and dilapidated. The towering walls clad in shades of rustic brown and green housed monkeys, who would stare at visitors and pass by as if it were a routine.The structure is built in stages with gargantuan gates at every visitation. The walls are relatively stunted and fubsy with shooting cavities opening doors to paradisaical panoramas.The scenery keeps getting better as you escalate further.Once at the crown of the fort, the feeling of accomplishment and ataraxia is incomprehensible. Every-time, you look down and pan around your view, the surreal grandeur of the Western Ghats behind the fog and mist sends shivers down your spine.Furthermore, the seraphic feeling of walking through the clouds at 5000 ft is a strikingly memorable one.Posted by Siddhant Raj Mehta"
258,Aurora of resplendence amidst the Western Ghats,It's a good trek experience...Requires patience and strength Good trek for begginersGood view at fort topDon't miss Vinchu Kada View...At some points it's Risky...Need Supervision of experienced people...Good Weekend Trek...
259,Lohgad,"People say the destination doesn't matter when you have a great group with you. But after visiting Lohagad, I can say destination multiplies the fun, thrill and excitement when you are visiting this place during monsoon. The chilling atmosphere right from the base, rainfall during the climb and reverse waterfall (due to strong winds) when you reach the top are the main reasons for you to visit this historic fort."
260,good for trekking,Quite a climb but once on top with the breath taking views makes it all vanish. You must do the trek to the very end of the fort once on top. Also amazing to see the under moutain structures like the cave shelter for the horses in the past. Also nice to see the designs of what is left of this old monument. Summer season the heat is tough do bring water and a cap.  Monsoon time is ideal. Driving up to the base via car is there but please drive with care as it has number of u-bends and it is steep and width of road is narrow.
261,Amazing view ,"Went with colleagues on an office team trek, though being a very rainy day finally only a few turned up but we were hell bend on doing this. A beautiful trek up to the fort after a long walk on a very rainy day. We were soaked to the skin and quiet tired but once you reach the top its totally worth it. Need a good amount of stamina to undertake this. 2016 was the year the beautiful Karvy flower was blooming after 8 years. We were blessed to see the entire mountain on the way up blooming with these purple beauties."
262,Fort cum Hill station,"30 min was the time taken along with my 4 yr old child to get to the top of the fort. Once atop u get breathtaking views of the valleys and pavana lake. If u r visiting bhaja caves from pavana dam u can find it on your way. A Rs 50 parking charges is levied by the gram panchayat for 4 whlrs, 80 for bus nd 20 for 2 whlrs."
263,good place,As my dad was Brought up in Lonavala he was keen on trekking. He took me to Lohagad. we trekked. Lohagad Fort is a beautiful historical place. Just carry a lot of water because you may get exhausted. Do try the JHUNKA BHAKAR Bharta sold by the Localites. it is really delicious.
264,Magnificent view from the top,"Was a great treck worth the climb. The scene from the top was quite breath taking. The rains added to the fun n adventure . The localities singing folklores of great shivaji added to the charm n filled all of us with vigour ,in all the climb is hard but worth it if you you are fit n adventure loving person"
265,Excellent place to visit,Its a Basic Trek. The last stairs are bit difficult but not to bad. you can have a fun time there with your friends. Please carry Water and some Food as its a wilderness out there.
266,First trek in Pune,It was very bad morning as the fog was becoming more and more dense as I started ascending to the top and ruined my photography at the height of 3400 feet.So try to go during clear weather if you really want to feel energetic.
267,Nice trek,"Nothing really at the top.   The climb is tough for the old/unfit,  but the views are great.   Combine it with Bhaja caves"
268,A fort near khandala old highway.,It is a good trek for beginners. The trail/ fort becomes very crowded on weekends. Try going on odd days.
269,Amazing fort close to Pune,It is a place where you will find an inner peace and calmness both at the same time .it is one of the  Worth going places
270,Nice place for trekking ,"We drove to the lookout point (scary switchbacks), then climbed up to the top with 3 kids (ages 5 and 9).  Don't bring food on the walk, as the monkeys got VERY aggressive with one man who had food.  But without food they were fun to see and didn't bother us.  The climb is in pretty good shape and the views were spectacular of the green valleys below.  We also stopped for yummy wada pav at the bottom.  Well worth the visit."
271,mesmerizing experience in monsoon,"You pay a small fee to enter, but a lovely fort to see with nice views from the top and a flat garden layout to walk through. Very high stairs however to get to the top of the fort, so be careful if you can't walk."
272,in the clouds....in monsoon,"Need to walk a lotHave many places to exploreThe more u walk and explore , it will give better experiance"
273,Very good place to visit in monsoon ,I was here with my friends for my birthday on july and we enjoyed thoroughly.. It was raining on and off with mist even the afternoon :) No surprises this has been rated no.1 place to visit in Lonavala by tripadvisor... Check out this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvUj8Cu-GuA
274,"Marvelous Fort, Marvelous weather","One could reach to the bottom of the foothill through a small bumpy road, but climbing up is difficult. Go there only if you are very fit and love trekking."
275,Easy Trek for everyone,We did sort of trekking to the farthest point and it was good experience. But not a place to visit in may as weather is too hot
276,Just another track...,"The Road from Lonavala is bad and narrow. Self drive - with caution. If you plan to visit Pawna Lake, do so on your way to Lohagad. After which you can continue to Baja Caves on the other side of the hill. Start early to beat the heat. The 380 uneven steps can make the climb tiring. Panoramic views of Hills around and Pawna lake on reaching the top. The fort is in ruins. No entry fee and no official guides. However ASI staff in the fort are helpful and can take you around if approached. Several water reservoirs, a dargah, a couple of temples in the fort make the trek around interesting. Set aside at least 2 hours for the visit. Paid Parking at the foot Hill. A few small restaurant and shops . But no Shops on the way nor in the fort."
277,Great,"So we were on our spree of exploring the western ghats , and landed at an unexpected trek to lohagarh fort .One might mistake lohagarh fort as a sight seeing spot just across the hill , but sooner or later you realize that the each step you take towards reaching the fort , you witness a spectacular specimen of historic events . Constructed by great maharaja surajmal  , shows the great craftsmanship and strategic war fortress , which this is one of the strongest ever built in Indian history.As you climb up steps towards the fort , there are so much to explore with secret caves and cannon spots which will leave you in awe of how strategically the fort was designed , challenging every modern combat .We climbed to the fort after some 500 odd steps , in absolute rainy season which was a delight as it made the experience even more worth . Reaching to the top there is a small shiva temple , cemetery of the king queen , 3 large ponds . The climate at the top was an absolute freeze with fog all around , and cool mist refreshing up our senses. The view from the top is an absolute delight and will give you and that awesome sense of accomplishment and  delight .Explore the entire fort at the top for that amazing photograph . Dont forget to understand the vantage point strategy of the king , how he would oversee the British army and keep them away .Keep your water bottles because their aint any at the top of the fort , you get some restaurants at the start of the trek . Njoy :) Thanks ,Experience A travel enthusiast & Die heart Foody"
278,Good place during rainy season,"You need to climb more than 250 large steps to reach the top. We reached 150 odd to reach an intermediate point and were exhausted by then. The view was breathtaking! If you want to climb the top, have ample time to take breaks in between. Keep water, juices handy!"
279,Nice architecture.Wear nice comf. footwear.,"Me and my husband wen to lohgad fort in the morning, right after our breakfast @ Lonavala hotel of ours. You will need to ask people passing by to be sure of the road you are following if your internet is not working. Otherwise google maps is having the exact location.The fort is a good pick to stay near nature but you will have to climb mannnyyyyyy stairs (my fitbit showed it was equivalent to 22 floors). View from the top of fort is amazing. Click the pictures from every corner please. You'll find many young people here, climbing up & down the stairs and at the top of fort.The property can be managed and maintained in a more better way. There is no visiting ticket for this fort but you should carry your shades (if travelling in season other than monsoon), WATER (very important) and I will recommend to carry something to eat (you will be exhausted after climbing at the top). Enjoy your trip."
280,Refreshing!!,"Hey guys, this place gives you a lot of exciting information about the old historic era. The place is good for all your photography too.. Avoid visiting in summers."
281,Easy enough even for kids,"Excellent day if you are fit and healthy and looking for somewhere to trek/explore. A bit of a sketchy drive to the base so would recommend a car not rickshaw. Foreigners have to pay 300 rupee per person. Takes about 30 mins of walking up stairs to get to the top with plenty to see along the way. Lots to explore on top, would spend a total about 3 hours here. Nearby is Bhaja caves."
282,Nice one day trip,Best to visit from June to Sept. Its the easiest trek ever. Honest advise dont drive all the way up.
283,nice and decent place for day out.,"Park your car at the starting point of lohagad n walk up.  Though it's a little slippery during monsoons but that's the best time to do the trek.  Get drenched,  chill there n come down for some chai,  pakodas n maggi!"
284,Light & Decent place to hangout and trekking,"i am not a history loving person and i don enjoy such places,but it is okay if you are looking to cover a spot"
285,Perfect monsoon trek,"This one is the most easy trek one can ask for, all you need to do is climb stairs, yea you heard me right, this ain't a trek, its just hiking where you need to go up and up, this one is best for families of all ages around."
286,Must visit in the monsoon,"This place is nice for a hike but do carry your water bottles, its gonna be a long and thirsty walk for sure!"
287,Great Place during Rain Season,"The climb to the top will make you sweat ....the steps are many and steep, though moderately well maintained.. the view from the top is breaktaking...."
288,Heritage,Don't listen to the wannabe hero reviews from Indian guys trying to look like they're trekking legends. They're all bluster. It's a decent climb that works the legs and lungs a bit but it's far from impossible. Great views from the top and worth the effort.
289,Heaven on top of the mountain🗻 ,We landed there by mistake using the wrong road. But loved the place. We even took our pet dog up for the climb. Lively climb up.
290,Excellent a easy fort to visit,"We started trekking the fort at 10.00 a.m. in the morning. Reached the top at around 11. There are big steps leading towards the top of the fort. Some of the places, the steps are broken and slippery. Also be careful of the monkeys that can snatch eatables and other things from your hand. So put everything in a bag pack. After reaching the top of the fort one can enjoy good wind and weather, explore the few spots at the top. Enjoy tea and wada pav and come down."
291,Too much Crowded,"If you love history,this place is a must visit.a very good place for sightseeing. take some proper attire for climbing!! because it contains about 300 stairs.Top view on this fort is the climax of this whole lohagad fort.A history lover's must visit."
292,good place for trekking,Breathtaking and I mean literally as by the time you reach the summit you are out of breath !!Worth the climb though as the view from top is amazing.
293,Impressive construction!,"You have two options. Either you take your vehicle to the base of fort and then climb approximately 300 steps OR you start from very base climbing on TAR road approx 3 kilometer to reach the steps and then climb. The climb to base takes about an hour. Unless you deliberately want to exhaust yourself, choose option to reach base of fort with vehicle. Climb on the TAR road is not strictly trekking so why exhaust yourself? The steps are safe except portions where there are no steps and falling monsoon waters have made the place bit slippery. Don't give up at this stage. This is just small 30 meter portion and steps are good once you cross this area. you will enjoy the views once on top. Entire climb plus roaming around at leisurely pace at the top should take you 3 hours so factor in 4 hours from time you park your vehicle. Best time to visit will be immediately after monsoons when everything is lush green. Avoid climb when its raining, some portions are slippery. Overall a nice one day excursion from Mumbai"
294,Good Place. Worth a Visit,Certainly worth a visit. The view from the top is amazing. One may face some difficulty in climbing.
295,Trekking ,"Quite a cumbersome stairway climb...(forgot to count the steps!) that led us to the magnificent fort. Truly inspiring structure that make us brood over the unknown past & relive their royal life. Lohagad fort is not an intricate construction but a massive history! After reaching the pinnacle that is almost like a plateau, relax near the humble Shiva mandir for a while and keep walking till you reach the apex point near the fenced 'Samadhi'. The view is spell bounding! Yellow flowers sprinkled across the green fields...punctuated by small pathways and surprising ponds of Elfin world! Seems...Fairies & Goblins would have existed!!"
296,High and Mighty!,"I am not sure I would’ve enjoyed this one had it not been raining.  It was early in September. We have some 200+ steps to this fort.  There’s no entry fee or anything. The steps are in a bit of bad shape. It was raining pretty hard at the time. Make sure you wear some comfortable shoes. Up in the fort you won’t see much as most of it is in ruins, but you can trek there. Visiting there in monsoon seems like a good idea ‘cause all the greenery looks pretty awesome. Oh and yeah beware of the monkeys.  Try and not carry some plastic bag or any food which is visible to them . They might try to snatch it away from you. Happy journey!"
297,Awesome is the word !! Must visit ...,"Situated at  the Western Ghats at an elevation of 1,033 m (3,389 ft) above sea level,  the Lohagad is a  part  of the larger Visapur fort. The range divides the basins of the Indrayani and Pavana rivers. Lohagad overlooks the Pavana reservoir, located to the south of the mountain. The hill extends to the northwest to a fortified spur, called Vinchukata (Scorpion's tail) Lohagad fort doesnt offer much other than a nice trek, a spectacular  views once you are at the top. There are innumerable monkeys so it is better not to carry eatables."
298,Free Fish Pedicure :-),It's a nice place but please don't make the mistake of visiting on a weekend or you'll be trampled by the crowd. We had a terrible time with the million other tourists pushing and shoving! It was foggy as well so didn't see much of the view
299,Lohagad Fort,"You'll be tested in getting to the top, but it's an easy climb for most of the way with new steps almost to the top.  After that it's a bit of a scramble over steps cut into rock.A 100kg Westerner, me, did the climb in 25 minutes in 36c heat, so judge from there,Once on the top, it's more or less flat with stupendous views in all directions.Best to go real early as it's an easier climb and the views are a lot clearer.Entry is 25rupee per person.Well worth the effort but keep a keen eye on children as there a vertical drops without barriers."
