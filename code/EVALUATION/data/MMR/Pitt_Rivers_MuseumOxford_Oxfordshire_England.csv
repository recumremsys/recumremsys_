0,Museum of museums,"Visiting Pit Rivers is like going back in time. It is how museums used to be - which isn't necessarily good but it really shows how things were presented and the attitudes prevalent at the time. Lots of recent controversy surrounding shrunken heads fits in with the whole ethos of the place. I worry a bit about being too self righteous about the past when viewed from a modern perspective. Things happened, that we cant change, but we can learn lessons from them. Well worth a visit"
1,Poor judgement,"This is one of those museums where if they don't have it, it probably doesn't exist.If anything, it's overstocked and there certainly isn't too much space to move around, but every corner turned leads to a new eye-opening sight.I'd go again tomorrow if I could."
2,Great ,"I loved this place. If you've been to the Horniman museum in London, it's similar in that it's a collection of different wonders from around the world. There's loads of stuff at ceiling level so don't forget to look up...I could have spent hours here if I hadn't arranged a timed city tour"
3,Bring back our shrunken heads please?!,"This is like no other museum on earth.  Instead of stuff being arranged by age or era it is arrange schematically and this is the glory of it all.  I could spend hours here, it is fantastic and brilliantly put together.  An absolute gem"
4,Great.,"Really excellent, a museum as museums used to be - total clutter but in a gentle logical (may be idiosyncratic) way. I've taken grandchildren and 'adoptive' grandchildren around lots of times and got them excited about the cultures of the world. Yes, even the shrunken heads."
5,One of the best museum!,"Excellent that the museum has remained the 'old way' -cabinet after cabinet of jam packed collections, a real sensory overload at times!I think it's great that the original tiny handwritten labels are on pieces. Its neck craning,slightly dim and you squeeze past the displays. Some of the collection has probably been accquired in insensitive ways, but that is history, it is of its time.Really worth a visit and several hours"
6,Take's you by supprize! Just keep's Giving!,"Pitt Rivers is the museum behind (at the back of) the Oxford Museum of Natural History.It's an utterly amazing and fascinating eclectic mix of things.Go and visit, you'll love it"
7,Mouse hunt!! ,"This is like no other museum I've ever visited.  It's organised, not by period or location but by anthropological usage - so you might for example find a case containing specimens of masks, from the ancient world right up to the present day, and from Japan, Africa, North America, Spain, New Zealand, etc, etc.  Another will contain model boats, again from all ages and all over the globe;  or whistles, or knives, and so on.  It's endlessly fascinating;  you'll need several visits to do it full justice.  What's more, it's free entrance!"
8,Packed to the rafters with artefacts and oddities.,"I absolutely love the Pitt Rivers, which for me is the best museum anywhere.Full of weird eclectic collections, you just never get bored wanfdering around,  And it's free!"
9,Excellent Experience,This museum is AMAZING.  Each area is like someone’s personal collection of stuff they were passionate about - and all the displays have interesting explanatory information. There are exhibits from 4.5million years ago to 20 years ago. There is no way you can see everything in one or even a couple of visits - you would have to keep going back and back. Luckily it’s free (donations gratefully received) so you can. It’s supremely clean for a museum with so much stuff.  Fascinating.
10,A Museum of a museum!,Iv been visiting the Pitt Rivers for around 45 years and I still get excited every time I go through the big wooden doors and down the stairs to the main hall and look up at all the artefacts from a totem pole to a samurai warrior
11,A fascinating hodge-podge of cultures and objects,"This place is wonderfully ""Oxford"". Hidden away at the back of the Natural Museum, it has lots of ethnological exhibits. Nothing interactive or computerised, you wonder around the displays, exhibited behind glass, you read the labels - and it is all wonderfully captivating. A special from one of my last visits: if you can, visit on one of the ""Museum nights"". Once or twice a year, the museums in Oxford stay open until late night. You get a torch at the entrance, and you can start exploring. It is a special experience to wonder around multiple glass cabinets in the dark, with a torch, and with most people trying to find the famous ""shrunken heads"" to add to the slightly eerie atmosphere - very good fun!"
12,Interesting!!,"Have been to Oxford a few times, and this was our first visit to the museum. It is filled with hundreds of exhibits, so I think there is something to interest every member of the family. And it’s FREE!! Donations can be made."
13,Amazing,The Pitts River is so different as you will see the moment you walk in from the National History Museum. It's got a completely different atmosphere. I recommend starting at the top floor 3 and working your way down.Thay so many items on display and just look above and below where the Swords are and check out how many more Swords they have stored. Absolutely fascinating.
14,Very interesting place,If you like Ancient times and like History this is the place to go. There is so much to see you woul not believe how Amazing this Museum is and how many years History there is to See. There is so much Humbling Surprise's to see as well. Definitely worth a visit.
15,Extensive,It was so refreshing to find a museum that displays its treasures the way museums used to. What a wonderful collection of everything. A fabulous dance before one’s eyes. This is a treasure trove of immense proportions. We loved it. Slightly unexpected entrance and not obvious but that makes the whole experience so much the more.Do not miss this museum!
16,Still the best museum around,A family visit to Oxford wouldn’t be complete without a trip to the Pitt Rivers and nature history museum. Plenty to see and do there.
17,Amazing place to visit.,The Pitt-Rivers holds so much much amazing stuff but it can be hard to understand what you're really looking and get the story behind it. The shrunken heads are amazing though and a must see for any visitor!
18,RUDE Staff member,"If you’re going to be in Oxford, this is a marvellous place to visit.  I get drawn back there each time, like a moth to a flame.  The old building is an architectural wonder, but if you can drag your attention away from that the exhibits are fascinating and beautifully displayed.  There is something for everyone here, and the fact that there are the extra facilities of coffee shop, etc., means that you can stay happily for hours - in fact, you need to spend quite a while to see even half of the collection!"
19,Rude blonde staff door member,"This museum is wacky, weird and absolutely wonderful!  So many hidden treasures for adults and children alike.  It's hard to describe but you have to see it!  Highly recommend."
20,Stupid women at museum,"Its next to museum of natural history oxford . Amazing how they put the stuffs and show them:) but becarefull u gonna see some doll's head hehehe . Im asian , and feel amazing how they collect buddhist."
21,Eclectic Museum ,"Visited here for the first time - and wow!  The natural history part of this museum is full of interesting animals and hands on activities, great for children!  The Pitt Rivers Museum part was jaw-dropping and you just didn't know where to look first!  What a truly amazing collection of just about everything!!  Definitely worth a visit when visiting Oxford - and especially great for children.  Very friendly, happy staff.  My only gumble would be that they need more seating in the café area, as we were unable to obtain a table or anywhere to perch - shame, as this could be a real money maker for the museum, especially as they charge nothing on entry (a £5 donation is recommended)."
22,Wow!,"First visited 1983 as an Oxford undergrad student.  Coming back in 2019, 36 years later, all the precious memories and artefacts are still there.Fun to share with my children.This place has character. History, scientific  rigour.Even more fun now to read the 1 star reviews.  Yes please.   Keep out unsupervised teenage groups. Some cheap tour agent throw them at the Museum (free of charge outing) and expects museum staff to manage their unruliness. This museum is part of the university.  It is not disneyland nor universal studios.  It is a 5 star joy for what it is and 1 star for what is isn't."
23,A lot to see,My favourite museum. A unique place with such interesting exhibits - you see something different every time you visit!
24,Visit,"It’s Free, well maintained and with  a fab display. It’s right next to another museum and a must visit for all age groups"
25,A Magical Museum...,"Went with my son who is in the anthropology business and fascinated.  We were too.  You just wander round gazing at new, weird, curious, illuminating and extraordinary examples of what humans do and make.   Allow plenty of time."
26,Fascinating museum of human culture....,Have been here many times but keep returning.  The collections are amazing - quirky and interesting.  You could spend hours here.  Really worth a visit if you are in Oxford.
27,What an amazing place!,This museum is outstanding.  You could visit everyday for months and still not see everything. There are no gimmicks or gadgets for children but we visited during half term and it was full of children in awe of all  the exhibits.  Definitely worth a visit.
28,A truly eclectic mix for all the family,"This is really amazing interesting and not at all ‘updated’ it’s the authentic Victorian museum experience, complete with shrunken heads.."
29,Eclectic,"I love the Pitt Rivers museum - I'm an Oxford local and go all the time. It's a wonderful, eclectic, strange mix of historical bits and bobs. Weapons, armour, tools, clothes, instruments, boats, cooking utensils, and of course the famous shrunken heads. From all over the world. Love the Pacific Island armour in particular, made of giant crab shells."
30,Loads to see in the museum. ,We love strolling in the Pitt Rivers Museum. It’s very interesting and there are loads of things for the kids to look at. The atmosphere is quite unique. Great for children and adults.
31,Amazing Place,Normally I visit this brilliant museum every time I come into the centre of Oxford but I am dismayed--even appalled--by the arrogant attitude of the curators who have decided what is incorrect for us to view.
32,Crazy Victorian collection!,"One could spend many days at the Pitt-Rivers. An unreformed Victorian museum of countless THINGS from innumerable cultures from shrunken heads to lacemaking machine, Hopi ceramics to Pacific shields made from lager barrels."
33,Worth a visit..packed full of wonders,We had a great time exploring the Pitt Rivers museum. There is so much to see here. The tours operated are great too as they give you background to some of the items.
34,Worth it,"I loved visiting this place...I love the way that all the artefacts are crammed together by theme, and it's so colourful and all about exploring. I picked up one of the treasure hunt pages for kids and me and my mother really enjoyed doing it! It meant our visit had some direction and that we got to notice little things we may not have seen just wandering (such as the world's smallest doll). I would recommend to anyone (child or adult) pick up one of these kids pages and go on a treasure hunt!"
35,Wish we had more time to explore,"Overwhelming, but in a good way. An important collection, that covers most cultures and traditions. Tribal artifacts, shrunken heads, weapons, etc So much to see and it is free. Just amazing."
36,Top Notch ,There is so much to see in this museum located off the Natural History Museum that you could spend hours and not take it all in. An amazing collection of artifacts from all over the world are on display. Also a free museum and world class.
37,"Should be called the miscellaneous museum, something of everything.(For everyone)","The Pitt Rovers has so many interesting, and uniquely informative exhibits that it is really doing it a dis-service to single some out. It would be possible to come here for three separate visits fo a couple of hours each, and still not have tome to see everything. I would encourage people to visit the museum"
38,excellent museum,Loads to look at and learn. Very interesting. It’s attached to the natural history museum which has some great dinosaur bones.
39,unbelievable you have to see it to believe it,"Sometimes you find a treat just by accident, we were on a weekend break and found this museum while on a bus tour and so glad we did it is full of ancient artefacts and is a must visit if in Oxford ."
40,Don't miss this little gem,"A huge museum where you will feel that how it´s even possible to see so many things at one place, right? Icredible and very inspiring to know more about history!!"
41,What museums should be,"Lots of really interesting areas, especially the evolution part showing dinosaurs through to homosapiens. The t-Rez stan is amazing"
42,Amazing museum,Great museum hidden behind the Natural history - both a gem and both free! The Pitt rivers has a mouse hunt for children (or me- since they didn’t want to co-operate) which was lots of fun. Encourages children (*cough* me) to really look into the cases and open up the drawers. Only gave it 4 stars as it is quite dimly lit which I found to make me rather drousy. Got a sticker at the end though so was all worth it!
43,Bonkers collection,"We had travelled a long way to come and see one of the museums biggest attractions; the shrunken heads, only to discover that the display is now debarred from public view because it is deemed offensive. Orwellian Thoughtcrime has been prevented ! It seems the past can now be obliterated to sanitise the present."
44,Lots of items,"I went to The Pitt Rivers today and it was so interesting, so many cabinets to look at. The textiles were my favorite, from so many continents.Allow at least half or a whole day to look at the exhibits."
45,January,"Visited with a few friends in January. Unlike them, it was my first time. It's difficult to describe, as the exhibits are both varied and unusual. The place is packed with exhibits, almost as if they have outgrown the premises, which is accessed from the Museum of Natural…"
46,Very unusual olace,"I’ve lived in this city a decade and this is still my favourite museum to visit. Simply excellent, so much to see!"
47,Extensive collection of eclrctic objects ,This is possibly one of the best and most informers and compact museums I have ever been to!  You actually start in the natural history museum and then walk through to the Pitt River museum.  Which had 3 levels and thousands of artefacts covering numerous regions in the world across generations!  Something for everyone!! Just incredibly informative and insightful anthropological journey!  Would recommend allowing at least 3-4 hours or possibly more!! I could have spent 2 days going around everything.  An audio version is available via WiFi which is available at the entrance of the museum and allow you to look at various different artefacts with a related audio explanation.  The museums asks for donations to the various sections to allow them to keep doing what they are doing!  Just amazing!  Cannot recommend it enough and hope you find it as insightful as I did!!
48,Just the best...,"This is small museum of old fossil collections and the odd stuffed animal. It’s not high art, nothing like the Natural History Museum but still an nice introduction for small kids to dinosaurs. It was very the day we went, bursting with families and a small gift shop."
49,Mini NHM,"Located in the back corner of the Natural History museum,  thus collection is a must see. It is my favourite museum ever! Every inch of space is packed with fascinating anthropology artefacts, but don't miss the shrunken human heads!"
50,Excellent ,This museum is at the rare of the natural history museum. Another brilliant Oxford museum. Didn’t know who Pitt Rivers was until now   Very.  well traveled guy and must have had a large house to house this eclectic collection    Just so much to see and well worth it
51,Just the best museum!,I have visited the Pitt Rivers so many times over the past 9 years- probably my favorite museum out of any I’ve been to. There are so many curiosity cabinets to browse through I seem to find something new every time I’m in there. I love that it is sorted by type of object rather than location or era - so fun to see how each culture made similar items differently. It can be tricky to find as the entrance is through the science museum and then through the doors along the back wall.
52,A Very Interesting Museum,"The Pitt Rivers is the weirdest and wackiest collection of ethnological curiosities. There are so many of them that everything is squashed together and you don't know where to look first. But whatever you lay eyes on is bound to be a treasure. It looked like the collection of a very adventurous and well travelled merchant marine uncle. I went alone, but would have wished to share my gasps of astonishment with someone. Amazing. In fact, I might just have to start planning my next visit."
53,Lots of cool and strange things to see,Amazing place to visit in Oxford. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to see history. This was great experience.
54,Overwhelming !,"I've visited most major History / Natural History museums across the UK, but this one is my favourite. Unlike the big museums of London, Oxford is smaller but not any less educational. Its beautifully laid out and all in all a fantastic place to visit."
55,A fascinating display in a chaotic way,"At the back of the OUMNH, this truely is a gem of an attraction. It's full of everything relating to human living across the world."
56,Superb!!,"Although the light is quite low there's so much to see and enjoy, a place to come back over and over again"
57,"So much to see, covering a wide variety of subjects.","A relatively small space, especially compared to the main Natural History Museum, but there is an awful lot packed in. Items are arranged by type rather than by age or source, which I found quite interesting. The dark room can get a bit oppressive, but I would definitely recommend a visit."
58,TREASURE. TROVE.,"I pretty much only came to the UK this trip to see Pitt Rivers Museum, having studied it as part of my post grad degree at uni. It did not disappoint, though in some ways it was quite different to how I imagined it would be. The collection is incredible, and the displays intensely packed with objects. It doesn’t hide from the colonisation/invasion origins of most of the collection, and is quite open to questions about it. I love that they’re making themselves a resource for artists and academics to conduct research and collaborate with. Museum nerds will be in heaven."
59,Incredible display,"An outstanding museum which we visit regularly and visit a different section each time we visit. The animal skeletons, ranging from pigs, to elephants and then to T rex’s give children a real experience which helps learning. There are bees, insects, geology and so many different aspects that make this museum a real gem in Oxford."
60,Beautiful and full of collections ,The museum building itself was interesting.  The exhibit contained all sorts of artifacts one could imagine.  Good for a lesson of world cultures.
61,Beautiful,I love visiting this museum and find new objects on each visit. It is top of our list to take visitors to when they come.
62,Like stepping into a pro!,"This is one of the best museums.  The approach to displaying, the possibilities of discovery, the sheer number of artefacts.  Lots to see, lots to take in, lots to do if you have small children (there are trails) and definitely bring a torch!  Well done to whoever is responsible for maintaining this brilliant collection and holding fast on how it is displayed."
63,Amazing Storehouse of Ethnographic Artifacts,So much to see and the children love both museums especially the dinosaurs and all the wired animals and fossils-so much to see! Our only gripe was the cafe isn’t big enough for the amount of tourists! We had to go elsewhere but that’s a shame as we could’ve spent many more hours here! The entry is free-that’s amazing!
64,Eclectic collection,Great place to learn about the evolution of animals and culture changes all over the world. A must see in Oxford!
65,Amazing,"A very interesting place to visit-lots of fascinating exhibits to look at and enjoy (including the famous shrunken heads!). A quirky and off beat museum with something for everybody. However, the signage to the pitt rivers entrance is poor. The entrance lies at the back of the natural history museum (which is also a good place to visit). When we mentioned it to the ladies on the desk, they said it was an ongoing problem and hopefully it will be sorted soon. This is a museum not to be missed!!"
66,Incredible,Lt General Henry Augustus Lane Fox Pitt Rivers.What a Name.What a museum.This is a unique destination so allow ample time.
67,Overcrowded with People and Exhibits ,We spent a wonderful couple of hours exploring this amazing museum which seems both chaotic and ordered at the same time. Lots of glass cabinets full of the most eclectic mix of things from model ships to the (infamous) shrunken heads to children’s toys from around the world. It really was quite a feast for the eyes and quite wonderful. It is free to enter but you are encouraged to leave a voluntary contribution. Luckily they have a contactless payment machine so don’t worry if you forget your cash. The Pitt Rivers museum is connected to the Natural History Museum so this is a great way of spending a couple of hours!
68,A hidden gem.,What a fantastic museum.  The exhibits are arranged by subject and they have items from all over the world.  I could have spent days there - and I'm not a huge museum person.  Everything from a shrunken head to modern stories about Syrians.  It is a true gem.  It's also free and good for children.
69,Little kids loved it in here,"You will never see another like it! Fantastic! Brillent, Amazing, Wonderful, A history of the World in one Building!"
70,Amazing collection,"Utterly mesmorizing museum that all ages love. One of the most interesting places to visit in Oxford who founding collection was donated by Augustus Lane Fox Pitt Rivers. It's a belter, just how a museum of curiosities should be."
71,Beautiful exhibits,"Oh, to live closer and be able to visit this unique collection more times... for one visit is not nearly enough to absorb or even properly appreciate all in this huge collection of  archeology, anthropology and natural history and other artifacts."
72,Exceptional museum,There is so much to see you have to return again and again as we did it is almost two museums in one so take your time and return to finish
73,A great place full of imagination,I like that the exhibits are gathered by item and not year /country/event. There is a huge variety of items.The special exhibition about the Calais Jungle is also excellent
74,Extremely high quality museum,"Jammed full of artifacts and items this museum id definitely worth a visit - we spent two hours and only scratched the surface of the many, many display cabinets.There is an adjacent Natural History Museum, but we did not really get the time to do it justice - so will have to visit Oxford again!A nice coffee shop can be found on the first floow of the Natural History Museum"
75,Brilliant ,Absolute gem of a place. Best museum visited. Feel like I’ve been around the world! Very helpful gentleman who guided us to the grass hat!
76,Highly Recommended ,Amazing museum behind the Natural History Museum. You enter from the back of the back of the Natural History Museum. The collections are a cornucopia of oddities from around the world brought back by Victorian explorers. You need some time to walk through as there are a lot of exhibits cramped together. Quite an experience and it's also free.
77,Incredible. Collection,This is by far the best museam in oxford for a group with mixed interests. The exhibits are so varied you are bound to find somthing to intrigue you. I've lived in oxford for 20 years and never get bored of coming here.
78,Give it as much time as possible. Well worth it.,This museum is chock-a-block with curiosities from throughout the world. It provides a perspective on the evolution of everyday life in different cultures throughout history. It was fascinating. The space was interesting too.
79,Rammed full of exciting 'stuff' ,"We only had two hours and were overwhelmed by the amount of great exhibits.For Morse fans, the Zulu knife that played a key role in The Daughters of Cain is exhibited in a glass case to the left of the main entrance.Plan on spending several hours here---you won't get tired or bored."
80,quite a collection!,"There's so much to see, you'll struggle to remember everything. Great use of their space and fantastic presentation of historical items."
81,A must visit,"Made the short trip to Oxford just to explore the Pitt Rivers Museum.We were overwhelmed by cabinet upon cabinet of interesting 'stuff' - from glass beads to weapons, and from textiles to toys, it was quite an eclectic mix.In almost 2 hours we only covered floors 1 & 2, so will definitely return to visit the more extensive ground floor of exhibits. Expect to pay over £7+ for 2 hours (the max allowed) nearby on-street pay & display street parking."
82,Do not miss the Pitt Rivers Museum,"A stunning museum set within the Museum of Natural History (which is impressive enough in itself).There are numerous cased items which look very impressive on arrival.We only had a short time in Oxford and didn`t really have time to do it justice - there is so much to see and take in (around 500,000 items I believe!) - multiple visits are required really in my opinion.When we next visit Oxford we will definitely re-visit."
83,So much to see,Our kids enjoyed this museum as much as we did. A lot of things to discover! Access is free but they do ask for a donation to the museum which we think is very fair considering the treasures they make available for the public to explore.
84,Unmissable!,"I love this place so much that I almost hesitate to share it with anyone else! The Pitt Rivers is a little off the beaten path but should be everyone's ""must see"" list in Oxford. A single large room with two galleries holding further collections, it could be walked round in an hour or two, or you could get lost in here for an entire day and still barely scratch the surface of it. The lights are low (to preserve the colours of the objects on display) and everything is displayed in wooden cases, many of which are the original Victorian ones and therefore exhibits in themselves. Indeed, The Pitt Rivers Museum is deliberately maintained as close as possible to its original state to also double as a ""museum of museum history"". Almost unique in the field of museum displays, the collections are grouped by object type rather than geographical origin or historical era, so you can find ancient Roman daggers alongside bayonets from the past century and a Zulu cowhide shield alongside a perspex riot shield from Thames Valley Police. This choice of display methods provides the visitor and the student with a chance to see the various developments in the evolution of an object, tool, weapon, item of clothing or musical instrument throughout history and across the whole range of cultures. Not only do we see the differences between cultures but, perhaps more importantly in a divided age with nationalism and intolerance on the rise, we also see the great similarities between all cultures."
85,Gloriously idiosyncratic museum,"The Pitt Rivers is a must-see in Oxford. It is one of the most unusual museums you will ever visit, snuggled in the back corner o f the Natural History Museum (which is also very good!). Together, you could easily entertain your children for  several hours on a rainy day quite happily. The Pitt Rivers is an anthropological/ethnographic museum with artefacts and objects collected from all over the world and arranged thematically or topically--  not on the basis of place of origin-- which makes for a novel viewing experience. There is a section for masks from all over the world; replicas of boats; all sorts of axes; clubs  for fighting from all over the world; shields-- that sort of thing. It's quite a small museum, and so navigating it-- particularly midday on a weekend when it gets crowded-- can be a bit tricky, but it's loads of fun, with new treasures and odd bits to discover everywhere you look. Imagine if your Victorian-era ancestor had traversed every known corner of the globe, and brought back trunkloads full of exotica; and then spent a few years lovingly arranging them in glass cabinets in small showroom somewhere. That's what a visit to the Pitt Rivers is like.For children of all ages-- and it's beside University Parks, a nice place for picnic in good weather, but there's a reasonably-priced cafe on the first floor of the adjoining Museum of Natural History--  and do venture to the upper floors of that museum as well."
86,"Lots to see, but needs more information","After viewing the Natural History Museum, we moved on to the adjacent Pitt River Museum.  Probably the oddest museum that we have ever visited - but quite fascinating.  Just think collections of various interesting objects - guns, swords, shrunken heads, knives,,,,wait - shrunken heads?  Yes - the multi-story museum has an eclectic mix of collections of everything under the sun - including shrunken heads...Well worth an hour or more of your time to explore!"
87,Highly recommended ,"The almost nice museum in Oxfordshire,  a lot of pieces and a fantastic experience for a great time. 👌🏻"
88,An amazing collection of diverse material,"Glad we checked out his place we had heard so much about. A bit overwhelming, but fascinating nevertheless. Artifacts organized by what they are, as opposed to their origin or timeframe. This enables a visitor to get a different perspective and see similarities across cultures and centuries. I enjoyed it but felt I barely scratched the surface in a few hours. Well worth a visit. Museum is free!"
89,"Pop in for a few minutes, or stay for hours","I have a confession...I came here just to see the shrunken heads. While it would have been worth the walk just for that (a staff member was giving a talk on them just as we got here!) we actually thought the entire museum was wonderful. There is so much to see, and it is all tightly packed in like some kind of Indiana Jones treasure trove. The items on display really fire up the imagination and a sense of appreciation for the beauty of other cultures.We were only in Oxford for the day so couldn't spend more than an hour here, but we could have easily spent half a day walking around and really taking it all in.Highly recommend."
90,Dinosaurs ,"Adore this museum. Friendly staff when you arrive and lots to keep toddlers entertained. Animals, stuffed animals that you can stroke and a T-Rex!"
91,Mr Lister,"This was a very interesting museum, even though it was hard to move around because of the narrow isles and so many people. Worth of visiting though"
92,Brilliant,"A great place to spend a few hours. So much to see - it’s amazing. Loved the rocks, fossils and shrunken heads...."
93,A Treasure Trove,"What a fantastic museum, so much to look at, left, right and above the glass cases are jam packed with curious from around the world. Free entry through the natural history museum."
94,Interesting,"Interesting Museum, one that you do rather quickly. Items presented in a nice, categorised unique fashion"
95,"Glorious, eccentric and brilliant","No surprise that this listed for museum of the year. Attached to the Natural History museum. Rather dark but has densely packed cabinets of remarkable and thought provoking artefacts from all ages and cultures. Too much to list, too much to see in a single visit"
96,Totally eclectic,"This museum is connected to the natural history museum, you literally walk through from one to the other.They have a fantastic collection of artefacts but there is so much to look at it is hard to take it all in as it is all very closely displayed.I found it a bit overwhelming and it would be ideal to visit several times and just concentrate on one area as to try and look at everything is too much. The museum is over 3 floors and has a lift or stairs to suit your mobility."
97,Eclectic,"We had a fascinating time at The Pitt Rivers. There is much to see, and the displays and cabinets are numerous, but easy to follow, although i am sure scientific minds will find more to interpret than we did............Interestingly we ascended some stairs to a landing where a black and white film was showing - the ""hollow ways"" of West Dorset - very close to my heart! This museum is worthy of more than one visit!"
98,the best day out in oxford and to top it iIT FREE,"Love this place, my Son first introduced us to it. So many beyond the ordinary exhibits with interesting descriptions of what you are looking at. Not too big either you can do it justice in one visit but you will want to go back as there is always some thing you will have missed. The Grand Children love it here too.See if you can find the Bernie Ecclestone look alike, I'll say no more ..."
99,Mini Smithsonian,"This was a great museum to browse round. We didn't spend too much time here but like all good museums, it's fun for a quick whizz-round, but you could equally get a guide and spend many hours here. It was well laid-out and really nicely done by 'type/purpose' rather than country, so you can see humans are pretty much the same the world over, that felt nice and inclusive. It is quite dark for conservation but that didn't make me too sleepy :)It's nice that it's joined with the Natural History Museum part, where you have yet more interesting things (dinosaurs!) and an average cafe/loos. Definitely worth a visit."
100,A must see full of curiosity items and history.,"If you visit you will have seen the Natural History museum as you go through it to get to the PRM. It is dark, so the exhibits do not fade and it is worth the effort as there is some strange stuff there. Also has possibly the best public toilets in Oxford"
101,Best museum In The World,"Located in Oxford, at the back of the Natural History Museum, the Pitt Rivers Museum is the most interesting collection of curiosities i've ever seen!60,000 items in the collection, arranged by type of item.Strangely fascinating, weird, morbid, enjoyable all at the same time.Free tours in the afternoon - thank you to our knowledgeable guide.Has to be seen to be believed.Free to visit.Highly recommended if you are in Oxford with a couple of hours to spare!"
102,This is incredible!,"The museum is accessed through the Natural History Museum and focuses on Ethnology, Anthropology etc. It is a truly eclectic mix of items and whilst not really suitable for young children it is absolutely fascinating."
103,Amazing!,"You might visit it for the architecture or you might visit it for the displays, but the combination make this a one-of-a-kind experience."
104,Visual overload in a good way!,"An amazing place to wander around, so many items from history from across the globe.  Fantastic.  One staff member had the bulldog chewing a wasp look about them but the others  were great, helpful and engaging.  The exhibits are so varied it’d peak the interest of all age groups.  Would go again and again.  Pity the small gift shop was closed while we were there though."
105,shrunken heads,We loved this unusual and quirky museum. We wandered around quite quickly as limited time but you could spend hours in here looking at all the artifacts.
106,A cold winters day,"This has got to be the most varied and bonkers collection of things ever assembled in a museum. It has something for everyone.If you have kids they will love it.Well worth the visit, its free but do make a donation please."
107,"Cool, Categorised Museum","If you are looking for an artifact from anywhere in the world, it's probably here.  But it will be hard to find in the crowded displays."
108,Amazing,Excellent museum with amazing range of anthropological items from all over the world. Nothing like it in the rest of the UK!
109,Interesting!,Old Augustus Pitt-Rivers seems to be one of those chaps that always needs extra baggage allowance for their return flights.  This collection is VAST!  Pretty much what ever aspect of human history you are interested in Augustus will have some item from it.  The size and breadth of the collection is simply astonishing.The only downside is that whilst the exhibits are stunning there is limited explaination of them.  Note.This museum is essentially a side part to the Natural history museum.
110,Worth a visit!,This museum is located to the rear of the natural history museum. It is free to enter.We visited when there were school parties and it did get very crowded and quite noisy.There is a lot packed in to the available space and the exhibits are crammed together quite tightly. The historic exhibits are from cultures all over the world. I felt a little bit uncomfortable with it as it seemed to lack modern cultural sensitivity.
111,A family favourite ,"We were told about the Pitt Rivers museum by a couple of young students my wife and I got talking to in a pub. We were so glad we took their recommendation as it was fascinating. You get to the museum via The Museum of Natural History, it's a door at the back of the main museum. When we first entered we both gasped as there was so much on display and, apparently what you see is only a fraction of the complete collection. I know these sort of collections are somewhat non PC these days but it's there now so don't let that put you off, it's amazing and one of the best museums I have ever visited. The main museum (Natural History) is excellent too."
112,If you could imagine a steampunk musem,I can get lost in this museum. I have been a few times and enjoy every minute. There is so much to see and the interest imof the place keeps me exploring and coming back. A must see in a trip to Oxford.
113,Favorite,"Omg, don't about the place but I took some great pics!The light was a little bit dark tho, but I recommend it ;)"
114,Sunday afternoon,"Lots of weird and wonderful things to look at, many of which will have great appeal for children. Rainy day? A perfect place to spend some time. Smaller than most London museums but well worth a visit and you'll probably still not see everything as it's spread over several floors each one packed with numerous well laid out exhibits."
115,A lot to absorb,The museum is truly fascinating and houses some unusual and interesting collections.Unfortunately we were unable to see everything as had left it a little too late in the day to visit.
116,An exciting interesting place to visit,An extension of the Museum of Natural History. It is packed with very interesting exhibits from various cultures.
117,A phenomenoon,"Very unique museum with an amazing layout. Items are grouped by type instead of by era or geography which gives a truely unique feel. So much to look at, must do on any Oxford trip."
118,Fantastic day out so full of amazing items,"Large museum, great collection. We spent about 2.5 hours in the museum and that was not enough! Definitely want to go there again. The museum is free accessible, but worth a donation!"
119,You could spend a week here,Spent a couple of days in Oxford and de used to visit the Pitt Rivers Museum.   My daughters loved doing the activities for kids and had a great few hours exploring the museum.  Huge collection from all over the world.  Staff were very welcoming.
120,A great afternoon,A fantastic place to visit. So full of the weird and the wonderful. We visited twice as there was so much to absorb.
121,One of a Kind,I simply loving visiting The Pitt Rivers museum and feel enormously privileged to live so close to this amazing museum. It is a treasure trove of fascinating artefacts that never gets boring no matter how many times you visit. Don't visit Oxford without  a stop off here.
122,Chaotic charm,"A museum jampacked full of curiosity item, history, weapons and armor. I can't stress how jampacked this place is. Every square meter of display if filled to the maximum of the items able to be displayed. be sure to plan enough time as there is a lot to see combined with the natural history museum to which it is build on. When I went there was a school of children running around and making a lot of noice but I assume this isn't every day so I didn't count it in my score. Probably the only reason it's not a 5/5 is that there were so many things and I was getting tired after the natural history museum. A definite must visit"
123,Absolutely amaIg,A marvellous collection of history and artefacts. The souvenir shops are worth the look and buy because you will be sure to regret of buying stuff that are cheaper than the high street. This place has the worlds library of mysteries of animals and items that will worth visiting more than once.
124,Amazing place,"I had for some time wanted to visit the Pitt Rivers Museum not really knowing what to expect, it is certainly interesting with its vary varied collections, i did find it a bit of a jumble, not the easiest museum to find your way round, i am glad i did it as part of a visit to Oxford as i think i might have been dissapointed had i made a special journey just for this"
125,Natural history at its best,We've been here at least 5 times now.  There is so much to see.  Possibly my favourite museum ever.  Well worth asking the shop to  borrow a magnifying glass to read the labels.  The shrunken heads are a must!
126,A Marvel,"A mini Natural History Museum (London), with much to recommend it.Animal and dinosaur skeletons, a good display of British birds and insects galore."
127,A hidden gem,Travelled from Northampton using the pear tree park and ride service. Explored Pitt rivers as part of our visit to history museum. Was pleased that they were attached. Some fascinating objects. Travelled with 2 and 6 year old. Eldest was a little weirded out by some objects such as the shrunken heads. They offer a paper treasure hunt which helps to keep focus. Great half day out
128,My Favourite Museum,"This museum has thousands of ethnical items on display sorted in show cases. It gives the impression you walk through someone's treasure room, which is very special. I think you can spend hours there just watching,items from all over the world. it is not very good for small kids, as it is completely non-interactive."
129,Am MUST Visit,Really interesting museum with TUNS of things to see. You could easily spend hours in here looking at everything.
130,Top of the league museum,"This is a gem of a place to visit. Cycling through Oxford we had a little spare time and dropped in here not really knowing what we'd find. We could have stayed there a good part of the day. Its all the bits you would not normally find in a more formal museum setting, it is definitely interesting, informative and a little odd ball in places. Alan"
131,Museum or rather a collection of things!,"When visiting the Oxford University Museum of Natural History go through to the back to locate the Pitt Rivers Museum, its free (please make a donation) and its amazing the treatment of Dead enemies area is good, so much to see."
132,Interesting Treasure Trove,Good large room full of strange and interesting items. Worth a wander around while in Oxford. Better for older kids and adults.
133,Exciting and quirky,"Called in here to pass a few hours before going home. There are so many artifacts and interesting information, we just did not have the time to take it all in. Great for children as there are lots of interactive things for then to do. Well worth a visit, and as it has free entry, you are only asked to give a donation to help support the museum."
134,Lovely museum,One of the best museums in the world. So much interesting stuff to browse. Favourite was the shrunken heads but all good here. Top marks and quite close to the King’s Arms for a pint or two afterwards.
135,Astonishing,This is a superb place for old and young. An inspiring place with helpful staff and amazing exhibits from every corner of the globe.
136,A bit too packed,"The museum is free and a must see when visiting Oxford. It is simply fascinating, you could spend hours in this museum and still not see everything."
137,A real treat,"Considering this museum is meant to be an 'open house' museum and there are meant to be friendly staff members we certainly were NOT greeted by any. The woman at the desk asked us if we had booked to which our college tutor obviously replied yes because we had. They had no recollection of our booking for that day and we were told to 'leave'. After a long bus journey our tutor said we could just use the toilet and then we'd be on our way however because there were primary school children, the woman who had just dealt with us told us we couldn't even go to the bathroom! after circling around the building in wet horrendous weather me and two other people decided to pitch back indoors but not in the way of those who were visiting. we then went to see if we could use the toilet only to find out they now had security people behind the massive door effectively waiting for us. The woman who dealt with us originally, saw us waiting, she then decided to approach us and tell us to leave once again, but when I replied 'we're only in here to shelter and find a place to go' she replied with 'well I'm waiting for a school group anyways'. This is totally unprofessional and whoever is higher than her should definitely be having a word with her. Just a shame I don't remember her name. She is incredibly rude and even had the guts to tell us we can't even come in dribs and drabs of three's or even two's because of the primary school children even though two massive groups had just left. considering that we told her we had a booking the way she treated us was as though we weren't welcome and therefore couldn't complete our primary research for our final major project. Not happy about this at all and do not recommend to anyone who is looking for anything informative to research about."
138,What a great museum ,"Great museum, could have spent a lot longer if we had time, lots of interesting things to look at.  Kids really enjoyed it."
139,Great museum to visit with kids,The museum is great for children and is packed with artifacts from around the world. they have a section o weapons knives and guns etc which made me nervous did not like that bit but reaaly enjoyed looking at the clothing from around the world and the building itself.
140,Interesting collection,Admittedly only 7% of what you see was collected by the man himself but even so what a collection. I particularly liked the top floor of weapons
141,Anthropological wonder land,"Really liked this quirky museum full of artefacts to showcase different cultures. Would have loved to explore more but was tired after a long day. If I go back to Oxford I’ll certainly be back to spend longer here.The only bit of feedback I’d give is that we happened to arrive just in time for a 25 minute tour. There were 2 guides with one in charge. He was great and explained things in an enthusiastic and interesting way. However,  there were a lot of people on the tour and it was very cramped and difficult to see what he was talking about sometimes. I felt that as there were two guides they should have split the group in two with one starting on a different level. But this didn’t ruin the experience and I enjoyed having another wander around at my own pace afterwards."
142,Very Impressive ,"Free entry 🙂 to an absolutely brilliant museum.Any family with children into dinosaurs, it's a must.Dinosaur bones,full skeletons,big section on insects, stuffed birds interesting but 😒the actual building is stunning, could have wandered round for days."
143,A museum stuffed with anthropological wonders.,We didnt have much time but the museum is great to roam around and discover strange objects. Definitely worth a visit.
144,Box of Delights,Very full museum lots of exibits we could have spent longer within all the aisles. It is good to see so many school children being shown round.
145,Not Quite Getting the Hype,"A really interesting collection of fascinating (and weird!) objects from all over the world, helping to explain the history of human civilisation. A nice old school feel to it, you can really feel the history of the museum as you walk around. As a result it's quite a traditional museum of objects in glass cases, and hence more for adults and older children."
146,Fabulous!,A wonderful collection of objects from around the world founded in 1884 by Augustus Pitt Rivers.  The objects are grouped by what they are used for or do.  Pitt Rivers donated his collection to Oxford U with the caveat that additional objects be thus categorized and that they be used for educational purposes - still done today.  Lovely gothic revival building with hundred of cases of many kinds of things - something for everyone.
147,Collection of artifacts from all over the world,"The Annex was the hit and while the natural museum was excellent, the Annex provided real education by showing artifacts related to daily activities:  music, sewing, mask making, war and so many many more.  They curated the exhibits to show how ancient people solved those tasks with tools that where contrasted between differing and globally separated societies.  As an example:  medical devices were both laid out chronologically  but also by societies.  You could see distinct similarities but no copies!"
148,Absolutely worth stopping by,"Go with something in mind, otherwise there is so much that it's quite overwhelming.Loved all the masks and small artifacts"
149,Cool museum,"Very nice museum, lots of arts , quite small to be honest.  I’ve been a little disappointed they close 4.30 every day ."
150,So many great exhibits---not enough time,Fabulous place to visit and free ......at every turn there is a fantastic item to look at .....allow plenty of time as there is so much to see on every floor .....keep an eye out for the shrunken heads
151,A lot in a small museum!,Wow thats a lot of stuff and a lot of cultures.I've never been to a museum with so much stuff on display! It covers cultures and agrees from across the globe and time.From pottery and Peru to shrunken heads to fire making from tattoos and baskets to scissors and masks.It's an amazing collection and with browsing although there is so much is hard to take it in... With going again as you will certainly see something you had missed before. There is a lift between the 3 floors and toilets (accessible) on the ground floor.No charge to enter but donations as a contribution to upkeep welcomed... And why wouldn't you?I saw plenty of buggies being navigated through the densely packed displays so i guess i wheelchair might too!It's an annex of the natural history museum.I'd go again :)
152,Beautifully displayed,well if you miss this university museum you will regret it for the rest of your life.it is so full of adventure and imagination it makes you open up your mind to what it was like in the days of the pre historic timesyou must see the shrunken head collection
153,Nothing to do with pits or rivers!,Incredibly many exhibits.  Entry for free.  There is everything you would expect from a museum.  Wonderful place.
154,So much to see,"Attached to the Natural History Museum, this museum has everything and anything, over 3 floors, we didn’t quite know where to look 👀 The lay out and ambience was amazing. Well worth a visit 😀"
155,"A wonderful collection, but not well displayed",Fab fun for all the family.So interesting. The shrunken heads are a real pull for interested children haha
156,"Go, Go, Go","Too much to describe - just go!Contentious due to the perceived imperialism, but the jumble of stuff from around the world is remarkable.It’s free, but they appreciate a donation."
157,A great refresher,"This is a fantasic museum that should keep all the family entertained whilst passing on knowledge.  Plan to spend several hours if your going to see everything properly and the Oxford University Museum of Natural History is only next door, if your going to do both museums together plan for the all day."
158,My favourite museum ever. Honest.,We struggled to find much of interest in this museum.We found the Egyptian mummy section quite fascinating but there wasn't much else that really gripped us.It almost felt like we was in some sort of junk antique shop or a hoarders house lol. I can appreciate not everyone enjoys the same sort of history but its still worth poking your head in as its free so a very good 4 stars.
159,Something for everyone,Great quirky museum absolutely stuffed with interesting facts and articles including the shrunken heads which was really cool! Free with a recommendation of donations as is the natural history museum that it is in
160,Most interesting collection of curiosities i've ever seen!,"My daughter is currently doing a dinosaur project at school and in all my life living in and around the area I have never visited.This museum is a must for anyone young or old, great to learn about so many things found in and around our local area."
161,Bit Dull,"There is so much to see here and the lighting is low to preserve the items. I rather had ""information overload"" but if you have an afternoon to spare this place is very interesting and something for everyone"
162,You need a guide to see all the curiosities.,"I love the layout of this museum, I love the artifacts it holds, I love the uniqueness,  I love the information that goes with it. Amazing museum one of the best I’ve been to. Shrunken heads were interesting and the weapons on the top floor"
163,Good for the little ones. ,I would have given the venue more but I found it all very dimly lit. It’s a fascinating blend of real and unreal exhibits. Curios from across the world. Fun and educational. Great for all ages.
164,Another Fantasic Museum,"Amazing museum, unusual, eclectic and very different from the traditional ones. Very much worth a visit."
165,Lovely old museum ,Having read all the fantastic reviews of the museum I really was looking forward to visiting. There really is no doubt that it is an impressive collection of artefacts but I just couldnt digest most of it due to the sheer volume of exhibits crammed into a relatively small space. There was no variety in presentational style due to there simply not being enough room - for instance I cant rember seeing a single 'interactive'/'digital' display to bring the highly interesting exhibits to life a bit.Given the overwhelmingly positive reviews I guess the presentational style works for most but it just didnt click with me. I would prefer the museum to rotate its collection and focus on specialisms rather than the current catch-all approach. I feel that less exhibits with a better approach to information and bringing the 'back-story' to life would allow for a fuller appreciation of the exhibits on offer. Good examples of this practice are - for instance - The Royal Armouries in Leeds and International Slavery Museum in Liverpool.
166,Fantastic - well worth a visit,"There's 3 floors of exhibits, lots to see and lots to learn. Check out collections from around the world with a cool back story for most if them. There are items there for everyone, from tapestries to shrunken heads, weapons, instruments and so much more"
167,Fantastic!,I could spend days in this museum! Huge collection of the most random items from all around the world. It is situated right behind the natural history museum so it is convenient for the entertainment of both children and adults (I’m sure kids will enjoy the dinosaurs and the dodo birds in the natural history museum)!
168,Unexpected,"Pitt Rivers has a huge collection of historic objects used in the everyday life of people around the world, carefully organised by type of object. For me the highlight was the weaponry and armour on the top floor. Free of charge and worth a visit."
169,An interesting museum,"So many interesting things stuffed into the display cases, you could spend the whole day wandering around here! Absolutely the best place I visited in Oxford. Staff were nice and friendly too. Definitely recommend!"
170,Great artefacts from around the world,"So much to see, we really didn't know which way to turn! It's well worth a visit if you are in Oxford"
171,Amazing!,"You enter the Pitt Rivers Museum by going through the University's Natural History Museum which is across the road from the rather splendid Victorian brick Keble College. Both museums are worth a visit if only to see their magnificent Victorian iron roofs, as I do with visiting friends to Oxford every year and three cheers for the University in keeping their entrance free.General Pitt Rivers was, apart from being a Victorian British Imperial general, a great collector of foreign objects with an eclectic taste. This being the southern end of N. Oxford where the average IQ is about 150 one has to avoid tripping over small children lying on the floors on their bellies drawing often rather well whatever has attracted their very -well stimulated imaginations in the collection. Children visiting the collection are strongly drawn to the magnificent N. American ""totem pole"" (if that is still what one calls them - we did in my youth). Perhaps they are no longer on public display but the displays of shrunken heads used also to attract children. My own favourite is a Polynesian king's cloak made out of thousands of humming bird feathers. In this small museum are packed so may gorgeous treasures that you may spend a whole wet winter weekend enjoying them.There is an interesting bit of more modern history associated with the Pitt Rivers. The Head of the family in the 1930's was a great admirer of Herr Hitler, as was most of the British aristocracy with one, very celebrated exception. A young British Army officer, a friend of my late father, had to visit that Pitt Rivers in his ancestral home in Dorset in order to disarm him when WSC became Prime Minister in 1940."
172,"Amazing Museum, but could take a full day to see it!","So impressed back in November that I had to go again.There are so many wierd and wonderful mini-collections but usually they have a theme generally illustrating the fact that  objects are developed by necessity and available materials leading peoples on opposite sides of the world to create similar tools or implements.It is impossible to begin to list the subjects displayed, suffice to say go and see for yourself."
173,Epic,"Can recommend it to everyone who likes exploring! I could have spent a lot more time there. A huge collection of random artefacts, some creepy, some not, but definitely worth discovering."
174,Unusual ,"We spent a few days in Oxford (Thursday 25th – Monday 29th April) and visited the Pitts River museum on Friday 26th April.  Rather a confusing situation, the museum is adjacent to  and is accessed through the Natural History museum.  Quite an incredible display of all sorts of things from all around the world."
175,Go there!,"Absolutely my favourite museum ever, and no matter how many times you go there is always something to delight and entertain.  Full of curios and oddities and just great fun, and it's free!"
176,"Wow, what an impressive place","Perfect day out with the family, just remember there is two museum in one building. Natural History museum and Pitt river."
177,What a man,Great place to go when the weather is bad. Lots of interesting things to see. Massive totem poles and shrunken heads.
178,Wonderful,Pitt Rivers is a must visit ...Free entry & one of the largest/best museums in Oxford.....Great for kids too with lots of animals on display😀
179,My 6th visit in last few months!,"We really enjoyed our visit to Pitts River Museum. There is so, so much to take in within every display case! It really is an interesting way to see how items have changed through time or places, and cultures from all over. You could spend a lot of time browsing these displays."
180,very interesting visit,we really enjoyed our visit. excellent range of exhibits = lost of historical information. amazing buidling.
181,Too much for one visit,"We liked the case you put a coin in then the eyes of the figures light up and they point at you!  Would have loved some extra info to add background to the displays, I know they have to keep the displays as they are, but surely an extra display board or two?  I especially liked the magic cabinets."
182,Fantastic Day Out! Can’t wait to go back. ,This is just a treasure trove of stuff....but the most incredible stuff you are going to find under one roof. All in glass cases harking back to another time. Some amazing items including artefacts from Cooks expedition....the most beautiful Native American buckskin. Great info on items in the cases and for kids on Saturday there is a touch and feel section with a museum volunteer which was lovely to see. Cant recommend it enough. Its free .....but please give a donation. You get to the museum by going through the natural history museum which is also a stunner - small but perfectly formed and again a childs paradise with children being actively encouraged to touch and fee which i think is so important. Well worth a visit and the donation as entry is also free
183,AMAZING museum !!! Make sure you visit!,"Well worth the visit - we were there a couple of hours and could easily have spent a day! A huge variety of artefacts ranging, by theme, from mundane to intriguing."
184,"2nd visit here, still very interesting",A very unusual and quirky museum collection - well worth a visit (esp with kids) - accessed through the Natural History Musuem
185,Astonishing collection and museum,Free entry and a really great museum. You could spend hours here if you like lots of random/ unique collections.3 floors of quirky items. Very enjoyable and will go back as didn’t take it all in.
186,What a amazing collection,There is a LOT to see here. The lighting is very low and it is on three levels. I was I impressed with the sheer range of exhibits they had. I will most likely return :-)
187,So must to see,There was a lot of recommendations to see this place before I left Oxford. I was not impressed as it felt like I was looking at random collections that were in no particular order. To make matters worse they keep the lights dim. This makes reading the history and descriptions of what you’re looking at difficult. There are three levels to this museum. The floor level has so much stuff that if you’re not careful you can bump into the side of the displays. It is a unique place in that it was donated to the university as one mans collection of stuff. If the museum would have taken time and organized it in a way that makes sense it would be enhanced.
188,Beautiful and interesting place,"Had visited one before then took my friend; she too thought it was a bit claustrophobic at first, as the sheer amount of material is overwhelming, and it is grouped by theme/anthropological development rather than time/country. However, it is time well spent, and we found some curiosities and interesting labelling. Recommended but there is so much - and it does get busy - that I'd do it in small doses, and keep coming back for other bits."
189,What a unique place,"Stuffed with things stolen from every corner of the earth. This place should be horrific on every level, but it’s mesmerising as a condensed collection of the human condition"
190,Brilliant,Some beautiful and very well preserved exhibits from all aroung the world. It was so interesting. Lovely to see children getting involved
191,Pitt River's museum,They have everything it’s such a great education for me and the family. Dinosaurs just unbelievable how there put up. Wow all sorts of weapons on the top floor and the history of it. I’m glad I came will come again but I’m no rush.
192,My type of place!,Well time spent there for adults and kids.Free what is a bonus  Really worth it a trip to Oxford and there is so much for kids to see and explore.
193,"NOT TO BE MISSED!! Great place to take kids, cool for everyone from 5- teens (adults too!)","Came here with my sister and Mum, just looking for something to do before our trip ended. We were in awe when we arrived, the building alone was beautiful. As we walked in we couldn’t believe what a cool place it was! There was no way we could do it all properly in a day and had already decided we were going to return with the rest of our family because we knew they’d love it too. So much to look at and learn and it just all looks incredible. Had a chat with a gentleman that works there for a while and he was so lovely and had so much to say and all of it interesting and informative. Definitely recommend this museum to anyone interested in dinosaurs, minerals and all the weird and wonderful collections it holds. And it’s all for free! Which just makes it even more enjoyable. An amazing day out for anyone."
194,Fascinating insights into culture,"Absolutely fascinating. Prepare to spend a few hours there. Lots of absolutely unique exhibits, such as the shrunken heads from South America. Will definitely visit again"
195,Two hrs well spent,A lovely museum connected to the History Museum.  Very interesting and informative. A good few hours can be spent here.  A good place to go if weather is bad.  Staff very knowledgeable and eager to talk to you.
196,The Lumber Room of the Human Race,"Honestly, you could probably spend the whole day here.  There is so much on display, over several levels, all very unique and interesting.  A bit of a speeze between display cases on the ground floor, but honestly, you simply must go here.  Oh and it's free."
197,Best History museum ,"To wish that this amazing collection were better ordered and laid out with more space, big informative placards and bright lights is, very sadly, to miss the point, the pleasure and the purpose of this wonderful, endlessly fascinating collection of things that human beings make and do and use and need.  I know of nowhere on the planet where you can meet so much of the human race in so small an orbit and so short a time."
198,Sporadic Exhibits in Dark Exhibition Room ,"I was rather surprised as to the amount of really interesting exhibits this rather small museum had to offer. It is free entry, and definetly worth a donation to support this little treasure.  A perfect way to pass the time on a rainy day in Oxford."
199,"Crazy place, interesting and fun.",Everything is a bit too packed together.Could be better presented.Weird lighting makes you feel sleepy.A LOT on display however :)
200,Astonishing ,"We have never been here before, so we visited while we were in Oxford with friends. Entry is free (charity donation recommended) to this fascinating place.Lots to see here, and the museum is split into two seperate places once inside - make sure you see both. Very unusual artifacts as well as lots of animal skeletons. Well worth a visit."
201,INCREDIBLE from the moment you set eyes on the building.,Have your eyes opened to so many items of interest it is a most amazing collection and there is something for everyone and it is set out in to collections to make it a little easier to take it all in.  It is not a couple of hours entertainment it takes quite a while to get round but well worth it.
202,Incredible Display,"Omg😍😍, this museum is amazing. So many floors, you need almost half a day to really get the full experience. It has everything all over the world. I was pleasantly surprised to see the giant tortoise from my beautiful country Seychelles 🇸🇨. It’s an out of the world atmosphere. I would definitely recommend as a must visit place in Oxford."
203,We had a good ,We were visiting Oxford for a quiet weekend without the kids. Great for a few hours when you can view at leisure. Fascinating cabinets with all sorts in them. The natural history museum and pittrivers are linked and accessed by the same entrance with the Pittrivers accessed from the back of the history museum. The natural history has a cafe on the first floor. Sadly the cakes are left out in the open so are dry but the coffee is good.
204,Wonderfully old-fashioned,"The collections are arranged by type, rather than geography, in order to demonstrate and encourage cross-cultural comparisons. As with the adjoining Museum of Natural History, there is far too much to take in on one visit, so I recommend selecting just a couple of galleries and immersing yourself in them."
205,A must if in Oxford,Fabulous exhibition. Took several hours to take it all in. People were quiet and respectful of each other. A very pleasant experience all round.
206,A day is needed!,Absolutely packed full with history. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and everything is is Victorian casing which really adds to the beauty of the museum. Worth a visit. And it’s free!
207,Must see,"What an amazing and interesting place! Could easily spend a day here and still need to return, so much to see and read about plus its free to get in! Good for all ages... would definitely recommend"
208,interesting!,Ideally you need to spend at minimum half a day here. Loved the Voodoo section. The bookshop could do with some thoughtful upgrade.
209,An amazing collection of 'stuff',"I’ve seen this place on the television numerous times and too actually see it with my own eyes amazed me. It’s at the back of the Natural History Museum and it’s free of charge but it kindly asks for any donations for the upkeep of the museum.There’s three floors of interesting facts and exhibitions. (Little tip, visit all three)Ranging from weaponry, jewellery, armour and many more! You could get lost in between the glass exhibitions whilst delving into the history of the Egyptian times or the Roman times. An amazing museum, so glad we came here."
210,Always something new to find,"If your visiting oxford I would definitely recommend, it's free attached to the natural history museum!"
211,Very interesting ,"I went there with my wheelchair-bound Dad, husband and teenaged kids and it was a gold plated review from every member of the party. We all enjoyed the way the artefacts are displayed thematically and the Victorian sense of the place. One of the party really enjoyed the Noh theatre masks and talking about them with an enthusiastic member of staff, onother really enjoyed the contrast with the adjoining Natural History museum. So brilliant, highly recommended."
212,A Treasure Trove of a Museum,"Theitems on display are shown thematically - for example West African, Canadian First Nation and Japanese masks are shown side by side allowing you to compare the astonishing skills and virtuousity of the people that made them. And there's so much stuff. Big thank you to the staff who despite the crowds on an August Saturday were willing to spend time with people and share their phenominal knowledge. BTW the folk who think the museum is racist, are, I think, mistaken - it shows a deep understanding of humanity as a whole."
213,Famo fun,"Lovely Museum. Great pieces. Great layout. Informative, fun. Can't fault it. Will 10000% be going back."
214,Wow,This place was amazing so many things to look at! If you want unusual and rare this is the place. Well worth a visit.
215,A fascinating anthropological collection,"If you have two neurons firing and are minimally interested in the natural world, I guarantee that you’ll find this an amazing experience! Once you’ve had your fill of college tours, green grass and climbing spires, then set aside some time to visit this magical place. Enough said."
216,A magnificent jumble: loved the shrunken heads!,"Resides in the Oxford college, the museum houses a wide array of collections and has an amazing history which includes hosting the famous debate over Darwin's Origin of Species back in 1860. Will visit again, and again."
217,Amazing ,We came here when visiting friends and the day was great.  So much to see good disabled access. Really well stocked and the shrunken heads are a must. So much culture and history and most of the staff are nice.  Except the cafe.  The male member of staff was really rude which was a shame. Especially in a family and hospitality environment.
218,Lots of weird things,"It was almost overwhelming, the many and varied exhibits. Different cultures represented, implements from days gone by, again covering a vast range of cultures and times; a definite must see venue, but leave plenty of time, we would have had a tour had we had the time. To be recommended"
219,Museum visit ,i loved all the information given to me about all these different collections. the guides were useful in telling me a lot about each and every piece.
220,Seal intestine parkers? no Decathalon then.....,"The building alone is pretty awesome and as we went inside I could hear myself mutter ""wow"".  The artefacts in truth are not that different to many other museums, but the way in which they are presented and set out really do put this place above some others.   It was a great visit and we had fun taking a few rather great photos.  Shop was a bit of the usual commercial rubbish but hey ho, its a museum, where else can you find a pencil or an eraser !"
221,Great afternoon ,Beautiful esoteric museum with wonderful collections of objects from a huge variety of cultures. Both incredible to see and very educational. A must see in Oxford.
222,Oxford weekend,"What a wonderful place.You need to allocate at least a day to do justice to visiting the Pitt Rivers museum. Three floors of fascinating stuff to look at and read about from buttons to clothes to swords and guns from all over the world. No wonder Pitt Rivers asked for a building to be built to house it all in.The contents must be worth a fortune but wherever you go there is something of interest and there are guided tours as well and all free unless you choose to make a donation.If anybody walks out without making a donation of at least £10 then shame on you as it is really worth it!Also, you need to visit the Natural History Museum in front as well which is equally interesting and agin give yourself plenty of time!"
223,Very interesting and impressive,Could have spent several days here but only had three hours which was not enough. It is well worth a visit and give your self lots of time..
224,Interesting time!,Free entry (donation expected) to this small museum that is packed to the rafters with interesting artifacts from around the World.
225,My favourite museum,We spent a couple of hours here but could have been there a lot longer. So much to see! Where ever you look there's something new and interesting to see and you don't know what you might learn next. Very interesting and definitely worth a visit.
226,A Unique Treasure House,to be hosenst a museum would not be first or seconend place to vist but pitt rivers opened my eyes and had a day to rember and will retune and to top it its free
227,Fantastic place to visit,"This museum is packed with interesting artefacts from all over the world. There is enough here to keep the visitor engrossed for months.  The rooms and galleries are so tightly packed with displays that it is sometimes difficult to navigate them. The displays seem to be organised by type and function of objects and items from different regions are often displayed side by side, sometimes confusing the unwary visitor! You will want to come here many times to get a full flavour of this overwhelming collection."
228,A treasure trove,Really good day out and you really need all day to see everything been there four times now and still haven’t seen everything
229,Well worth a visit,"Packed with accessible, relevant, and interesting information. The building is beautiful and you aren't bombarded with marketing."
230,Overwhelming,"I already had this on my to do list from tripadvisor and found the mix of the Natural history museum and this makes a very interesting visit. If your not that bothered about dinosaurs but the kids are, break away into this labyrinth of culture and absorb some remote civilization history. The shrunken heads was a bit of a surprise for me, I heard a mother reluctant to confirm they were real to her daughter which was quite amusing.A very good educational source to understand what we utilised to survive from natural materials.The stuffed fox seems to be a big winner for the kids.An absolute must for Oxford. The grounds look nice outside and i can imagine a welcomed space in the summer.The facilities are excellent, go very early or last couple of hours, it gets really busy!oh and it's absolutely FREE"
231,Fascinating and Quirky!,One of the best places to visit in Oxford. Jam packed with items from all over the world.I was taken back in time on my visit. There is so much to see. I especially liked the SE Asian display cabinets. Facilities are good too.I highly recommended visiting this jem in oxford. Only 5 minutes walk from the center of town.
232,Some great exhibits for a small museum.,"This place is amazing and a must see. Didn’t spend a long time in these but will on my next return. So much interesting artefacts on display, although seems a little cramped in having so many things to display it is a fascinating place. My highlight is the shrunken heads on display and some weird things to see in believable."
233,So much to see and so interesting.,"We called here again because there is so much stuff to take in. I actually missed a whole floor at the last visit. If you come to Oxford it goes without saying, visit here, put it in the top 5 things to do."
234,So much to take in,"This place is crazy.  Loads and loads of stuff crammed in there.  This is the house of the worlds greatest hoarder.  My full sympathies to the relatives that had to clear out Pitt Rivers place when he shuffled off this mortal coil.  Rather than carefully placing everything in individual cases with 4 inches of spacing between artefacts and leaving the rest in an archive somewhere rotating them every now and again, they have shoved the whole lot in there.  Case crammed with spears.  Case crammed with shields. etc etc And my favourite, and ancient eskimo ladies underpants.  Which teaches you another valuable lesson.  If you don't clear out your place before you shuffle off, your undies may end up in a museum.  And they may not be your best pair.  Think on that.  And visit this hugely enjoyable and quirky museum.  Give them your money."
235,Mr,There is such a wealth of artefacts and interesting items here it is well worth a visit.  The well-equipped coffee shop is an added bonus.  Look out for the escorted tours of the 'back office' as well.
236,Unbelievable ,"Wow!! Fantastic museum, so much to see. Thoroughly enjoyed, great for children, lots of families there."
237,Lovely museum!!,Artifacts from all over the world take you to a trip to so many different cultures and historic periods.Highly recommended also for children.
238,So much to see but could be better presented,This respected museum covers a multitude of different cultures from around the world. You should allow at least two hours to visit this museum.
239,Still the best,"Having spent New Years eve in Oxford we were looking for something to do New Years day, we first went to the Ashmolean Museum but it was closed so we went for a walk around the park next to Pitt Rivers then went inside, wow great dinosaur skeleton's as well as other animals, also very good for children as they could touch some of the stuffed animals."
240,There are museums and there are museums.,Worth the visit for the shrunken heads (gruesome!) but not enough information to keep a 6 and 9 year old's interest in the rest of the collection.
241,Not for everyone...,There are a lot of exhibits in this museum (including shrunken heads).  Arguable there is too much crammed into this space.  But there is certainly lots to see.  And like all museums in Oxford it's free.  Though donations are encouraged.
242,Unreal ,Fascinating exhibits and very helpful staff.  They do run various exhibits and activities especially for kids.  My son and I loved it equally and cannot wait to get back.
243,1st visit ,"This museum has an unbelievable collection of over 400,000 items.  Plan on spending several hours there, it is overwhelming but definitely worth a visit."
244,Girlie fun,I visited this museum with my daughter on a Sunday afternoon with just a couple of hours to spare. We needed much longer! Absolutely fascinating and as good as any museum in London. Will definitely return some time. Very highly recommended.
245,More than just shrunken heads !,V i P  Excellent  Pitt Rivers Museum thanks one of my new friends in UK who work in Kuwait   who told me about  it the  Museum is free of charge with donation option its very nice  one full of  exhibits   marvelous  fantastic well organized recommended strongly
246,Journey into the stranger kind,"Oh just go, you will be amazed, confusing and intriguing in equal measure and you have to avoid dinosaurs to get in!"
247,A lot packed in,This was a great place to visit with my grandson. He found it very interesting with lots to see and to discover. It is very well organised with artefacts from all over the world but you do not feel cramped.
248,Must-see,"This is the private collection of an undergraduate who ended up retiring from the Army as an Honorary Lt Gen but who, in the meantime, amassed a huge collection of just about everything. No idea where he kept it all but if you are into the truly weird this is probably right up your street. Confusingly, it is at the rear of the same building that houses the Natural History Museum. Enter the Natural History Museum, walk down through the dinosaurs and turn left past the statue of Darwin."
249,Really interesting loads to see,"Discovered by chance, brilliant museum free entry(donation advisable), several floors of world artefacts through the ages. Excellent to see many artefacts that you may have only seen in books or tv. Well worth a visit if you're in Oxford"
250,Great,"We only explored the ground floor.  So very much to see and enjoy, admire or frankly cringe at.  Highlights  for me were the musical instruments and the American exhibits.  Most fun was the hands-on table with an amazing expert allowing us to play with seven  very varied exhibits, the oldest a belemnite fossil, the newest a bird made of waste plastic.  I want to see the rest some time!"
251,Very unusual place,"Vitrines that are stuffed and crowded to bursting, labeled by hand and arranged quite idiosyncratically gives this a feel unlike any other museum in Oxford. A bit like wandering into Indiana Jones‘ museum. I really enjoyed it."
252,Denied access.,"This place is amazing! So much to see! We took my 10year old daughter and she loved it. The university students and staff were fantastic, at three separate times when my daughter expressed interest in objects, they were really enthusiastic about the topics and happy to chat to us about them. We can't wait to go back."
253,Absolutely fascinating,"Incredible museum, filled to the brim with all sorts of quirky things from around the world. You could spend hours in here!"
254,Amazing!,"I did not have much time, a matter of minutes rather than hours but I was determined to see this museum which I had wanted to visit for years and years,I loved the building itself and the galleried layout. The galleries can be accessed by a modern lift just outside the main hall.I particularly liked the weapons which covered such a wide range from slings to revolvers.Other cabinets cotained mundane cooking instrumennts which all had a similar appearance and use but were form other sides of the world.I could (and hope to) spend a half day here soon and get the real benefit of the different levels and subjects."
255,Unique museum ,"A bit of an assault on the senses. A lot of artefacts in a very small area. While interesting, the items are very densely packed making it hard to navigate with lots of repetition. Some gaps between cases are less than 1m wide. The museum is also very dark and the information tags about the exhibits are very small / few and far between. Nether the less, it was good to see such a variety of artefacts from many cultures around the world."
256,A lot to take in,"A cornucopia of treasures, trophies, trinkets and probably some trash displayed like a Magpie's hoard in a dimly lit, atmospheric museum.Visit again and again and again and again and again..."
257,Interesting and enjoyable visit,"Massive collection, somewhat randomly displayed, but an amazing experience of a collector of his period. Suggest not for children although access is through Natural History museum and that is great for younger visitors."
258,Breathtaking,I have never seen as much all under one roof! Try and go without little ones as you need to concentrate to be able to see everything.
259,Amazing ! How they show the stuffs,"Interesting and enjoyable visit, although found the exhibits a little cluttered.  As the museum was busy and displays were so close together, had to miss some areas out due to viewing demand."
260,Magical,"Well worth a visit, some really good exhibits, especially the dinosaurs. Some of the stuff like the birds and insects are looking very tired however."
261,Great museum ,"Such care taken over the displays to make the most of the space. Excellent lighting. I was surprised and interested to see that the early anthropologists at the forefront of research, who were involved with the Museum in some way, were women. What they achieved is remarkable. Some of the masks might be a bit scary for very young children but on the day we visited there were lots of families who all seemed to be getting a lot out of their visit."
262,Amazing museum,"On a wet half term Wednesday, my two kids and I loved this place, it was an absolute treasure trove of items from across the globe from outfits, charms, model ships and masks to clay pots, devotional and Egyptian antiquities and curiosties. Well worth a visit as it is attached to the Natural History Museum which is an equally beautiful building. Note: arrange to park and ride as this would much easier than trying to find parking, road parking expensive and limited."
263,Never fails to impress...,Great place to take the young kids. The staff were informative. The kids can take part in interactive games. Great place for the kids who have become bored of being dragged around old historical buildings.
264,Need more time,There is quiet a lot to see and everything is concentrated in one place. We noticed an parent/kid with an audio device but had already gone though most of the museum. Worth knowing at the start if you would like to enquire about it and make the most of the visit. My 8 year old loved seeing the dolls and the mummies. This museum is right next to the Natural History Museum of Oxford which was much appreciated by our young children as you can touch some of the animals on display.
265,One of two small but fascinating museums on one site in central Oxford,If you could put a more diverse selection of things in one room this is it.Its good fun and well worth the visit.
266,A special place,This place is stunning . The amount of stuff on display is incredible. You can't fail to find something interesting.The building itself is a work of art. You will need more than one visit.
267,Short Stay ,My mate and I always meet up once a month and this time it was Pitt Rivers. I have to tell you this place is stunning. There are so many exhibits to see and is absolutely interesting. You need several hours to go round and take your time to take it all in.A great place to take the kids on a rainy day to pass a few hours.Brilliant!
268,Beautiful museum,The Museum is excellent and contains an enormous amount of artifacts in the space provided.  Plan on at least full day to take it slow and try not to miss any of the items crammed into every space available.
269,"A brilliant mix of culture, very interesting, and fascinating display","We are one man with his wheelchair coupleYou have side entrance for wheelchairs and pushchairs it’s signed it’s some kind of back entrance bit confusing but we got there. We came for Pitt rivers that is a wonderful collection of everything and moreYou could spent days in there just looking It worked for the wheelchair,  it’s a bit tight by times especially when people have to pass youBut in the end it’s an old museum Disabled toilet where fine and cleanI would love to go back and see moreIt one of these museums where you see something new every time you goStaff was really friendly and loved telling there stories I would have enjoyed it more if I had a restful night before in a lovely special hotel I just remembered I did but that’s a story for an other review"
270,Fascinating collection of curiosities,"Very nice time! Was quite full as it was easters break, I assume. However, really nice time! We will be back to see next part of the musem as we had time only for one half..."
271,Fascinating,"What a delightful surprise. Never been to such an eclectic collection. Endless cabinets of the most interesting items, something to interest everyone. Will return ."
272,A different View!,Loved every minute and will definitely be visiting again with the grand children.Really impressed with the attention to detail such a wonderful place to visit.
273,A Strangely Fascinating Series Of Collections,"Entrance to the Pitt Rivers Museum is through the gothic doorway at the rear of the main hall in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Pitt Rivers houses an eclectic collection covering many aspects of human culture from shrunken heads to coinage. The real charm of the museum is its density of displays both in terms of the number of display cabinets crammed close together, and the volume of exhibits in each. The main display area is on the ground floor with two further floors with galleried displays around the perimeter.A truly unique museum that should not be missed, especially as entrance is free (donations welcome), and it's only a short five minute walk from the city centre."
274,Really interesting,Amazing collection of eclectic stuff from around the world. Not to much in the way of explanation to bore us either
275,V i P  Excellent  Pitt Rivers Museum,"Even though forewarned, by a daughter who worked  there,  of the extent of the museum, I was not prepared for the sheer volume of exhibits in this museum.   It was absolutely fascinating.  A few hours was not enough to take in all there is to see - I wish I had had more time.  I will be back!"
276,A truly Eclectic Collection,"This museum is very interesting and has a massive range of exhibits focusing on different cultures. They include costumes, jewellery, weapons and lots different objects from various cultures. There are so many exhibits, you could easily spend several hours looking around the museum.You also have the Natural History Museum next door."
277,Fascinating and worth a few visits especially with kids,Went with my friend and her children we ranged in age from 8 to 18 and everyone had fun and found some weird stuff to like and look at. Staff were nice too and you can touch stuff
278,nice day out,"This was definitely interesting & creepy for me all at the same time. So many things to see, the shrunken heads was horrible. The lighting was very dim as well which added to the creepy atmosphere. It’s a good day out & free entry, you can leave a donation in the entrance if you want too. With it inside the natural history mueseum makes it even more a fun day."
279,An unusual array,Wonderful collection of fascinating objects from all over the world - very family friendly with excellent informative staff always on hand for queries.  Excellent place for children to learn while having fun too.
280,Great for a stimulating few hours7,We went as four adults and 6 children. The children were under 4 and didn't show great interest in the items.
281,Love this place!,"What a surprise! This place is packed with fascinating artifacts from all over the world. You will need several hours to get through it all, but really quite interesting."
282,Really interesting ,"I loved seeing the variations in swords, knives, and other weapons,  Coins, clothing, and multiple other artifacts from daily life shows how people are so different."
283,Fascinating,Popped in just to tick it off to be honest but was quite uplifted to see such excellent use being made of some quite 'dated' exhibit styles... Loved the engagement for young children able to touch the bears and other exhibits to truly make a tactile and interactive museum…
284,"Eye opener, ",Amazingly eclectic range of items. Mind boggling display of everything from fossils to Seal skin ponchos from the 1900’s. Busy in school holidays but worth a visit. Attached to the museum of natural history that is also fascinating. A sensory overload.
285,Visit with my old mate,"Wear some comfy shoes because you will be here for a while!! There is ALOT to see and take in. So many interesting pieces to look at, just when you think you have finished looking at one section, you will realise that there are more objects under the cabinet you have been looking at."
286,"So much to see, we need to return","Well curated, interesting, diverse collection covering human design in everything from tattoos and textiles to weaponry and clothes"
287,Oh my goodness... what a hidden gem!,Amazing collection of many different items from across the globe. Something for everyone here! Diverse artefacts from many cultures.
288,Fantastic museum with such a variety and interactive display,"This museum showcases a wonderful assortment of different collections, all made up of interesting items and covering a myriad of different topics. The way said showcase's performed is, however, a bit chaotic, with collections loosing a bit they ability to tell a story from their seemingly ""it's where we could fit it"" they have been arranged on the available space.If going through aisles of random items, no real topic seemingly dictating their arrangement, is a thing you like then you will enjoy this museum. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if organized displays is a.thing you like, be prepared to find little or none of that here, at least on the ground floor (the upper floors make a better effort of being  more coherent)."
289,Bizarre and brilliant!,"There were lots of interesting items to see, but to me the lighting was very dim which made it harder to see some of the objects, but it was very good for a free museum."
290,Unusual Collection,Good luck getting past the doors if you are a young adult... a women at the door assumes that you are in a college group and will not let you in if you haven’t booked. She asks if you have been before and then where we are from and by rights we had no reason to tell her. Then there was a petty argument discriminating against younger looking visitors and not picking out other age groups because said woman “knows they are not in college”.There was just two of us and she continued to decline entry even though other people in groups of four were just wandering in. She had also specifically pointed out that we needed an adult as if we were not capable as young adults and threw in that she “had turned down people from China” really not something to brag about. We had specifically traveled down to be educated about those museums and the disruptions has badly implicated  our work as it was vital research. We will not be belittled as if we are children just because a women seems to think that older ages are superior.
291,Not enough time,Very clean and tidy with a great range of things to see. Very educational. Would recommend anyone visit.
292,Interesting & creepy,If you are in Oxford and have time make sure to keep a couple of hours to visit Pitt Rivers it is full of amazing things to see.
293,Fascinating museum,"I am disgusted by the way I have been treated today. As a group of 6 we were “greeted” at the door by an extremely patronising member of staff. She frog marched us out the the building as she requested we have an adult/course leader with us after interrogating us on where we were from. Bare in mind every one of us is 18-19 and are classed as adults and were there on an independently arranged visit. We were accused of being with other people and pretty much shouted at by this lady. The fact we were from stoke seemed to insinuate the interrogation, and low key felt like discrimination. We returned later as a 4 thinking we would be let in (which we were), due to the issues caused previously, the remaining 2 of us came in later but were refused entry and once again angrily interrogated by this member of staff. Us inside were followed round the exhibition and this particular rude member of staff was watching us and shaking her finger at us. Safe to say our trip was ruined by the disgusting display of customer service by varied members of staff at the Pitt Rivers Museum and will never be returning again. This staff member was blonde and wore flowery trousers."
294,"Nice, dark and cosy",Well laid out welcoming and friendly. Really interesting. Very informative. Lots to see but not too overwhelming.
295,A Favourite In Oxford,"Do NOT make a visit if you are in a group larger than 6. We were greeted by an AGGRESSIVE, RUDE and CONDESCENDING lady who escorted us out the building saying she wanted to talk to an adult because we weren’t aloud to enter on our own (baring in mind we are 19). We tried a second time to enter the museum 2 hours later in groups of 4 and 2 as we traveled 3 hours and would be a waste of a day if we didn’t enter the museum. Four of us were aloud in however she was very reluctant, but the other two weren’t she was continuously asking where we were from(even though that has no relevance) and was giving us no valid reason to why we couldn’t enter. I have been treated with so much disrespect and this lady was ludicrous and obviously needs to be retrained or get a new attitude, we would understand if we were a huge group of children who obviously need adult supervision however I am 20 this year and do not need to be told that I am only aloud to enter with an adult or on my own another day! I was looking forward to visiting however after this experience will never be returningThe lady had blonde short hair and flowery trousers"
296,A step back into the old,"In Oxford for the day to attend a football match, I took the chance to spend the morning in one of our favourite Museums. We have visited on a number of occasions over the years and it has never failed to enthrall. The way it is set out with displays grouped round certain objects rather than periods or areas works well. It is not a Museum to hurry through, rather, as we do, cover a few cabinets in detail and return again. A delight and we will be back again sooner rather than later."
297,Fav museum in Oxford,"So oddly fascinating, not for the faint hearted, definitely for the curious and quirky.Very interesting and could easily lose a whole day here, and actually get lost on the way round"
298,Great day out,"This is one of my favourite places to visit, before you even walk in you are met with incredible architect of Gothic Influence.Walking in always makes me gasp, the wonderful high ceiling, pillars of ornate stone and iron and the amassing roof line.    NOT to mention being greeted by some overwhelming specimens of our past.The Tyrannaosaurus Rex dating back some 66 million years is just one of many ....Its free admission to add another bonus.Do not leave Oxford without visiting."
299,First visit but it won't be our last,Loved every second. Well worth the visit. Perfectly laid out and incredibly interesting and engaging
