91,Views and history,"A great way to see some of the coast with elevated views of the city on the other side of the walk. A little way down the walk from the Northern end you'll find lists of Australian servicemen...perhaps you'll find a long lost relative memorialised? The walkway is wide and sturdy and again from the North, is accessible to wheelchairs and prams, but about 300 metres along you'll encounter stairs, so if you're in a 'chair or on a mobility scooter you'll need to turn back, but you'll still get some great views and it's worth taking a look."
92,The spectacular views in 360 degrees!!,An exhilarating walk to rest on top of Newcastle and walk slowly looking for a family members name on the soldiers sculpture. An amazing experience a must do.
93,Great walk. ,The walk provides views over Newcastle as well as the harbour (Hunter River) so also you to gain a perspective of the city and its formation.  It also gives a view along the coast and some of Newcastle's beaches giving you a perspective of the lifestyle in the region.  Even though it is winter swimmers and surfers were both out in the water enjoying the conditions.  The walk also provides a lovely view of the ocean and if you are lucky you may see a pod of dolphins that are regulars in the area.  At this time of year the whale migration is on so you could also be fortunate and witness this spectacular event as well.It is a memorial walk so there are remembrances to the the various wars people in the region have been part of and lost their lives at.  Always though provoking to look for your family name and think if it was somebody on a far flung part of your family tree.

154,Great small walk,"A great experience for old and young alike,fabulous views and plenty of imformation to keep you occupied .On the downside the car park is very small and access at the other end is by steps only so no good for people in wheelchairs or with walkers.but if you can get into the carpark it is well worth a visit."
155,Great walking and viewing.,"Soooo gorgeous! Walk was just right, not too long not too short. One side is a view of the city, other side is a view of the ocean. Just the perfect mix. View was ethereal."
156,Perfect walking track for the young ones. ,The scenery along this walk is beautiful and thought-provoking. I enjoyed reading the information alongside the artwork. It is well sign-posted and easy to navigate. There are quite a few steps but the pathways are even and flat.
157,Easter vacation ,What a wonderful addition to Newcastle. The views are spectacular and it is so accessible to all.It makes me very proud to say I live in Newcastle.
158,Great views across the city,"This was a pleasant walk & very leisurely.  Beautiful views. We took about an hour & half to enjoy, take pictures & take all in."
159,Memorial Walk,"Love doing this walk, from Newcastle beach past the Bogey hole to Merewether, steps are a bit tough on the knees but the views are worth it"

163,"Beautiful, Well Kept Walk",Where else can you walk with comfort with vista views across the ocean and learn some Australian History on the way. Great job Newcastle!
164,Anzac Memorial Walk,I walked from Dixon Park to Bogey Hole. Memorial walk is the best option on this route because of the views.
165,Newcastle Memorial Walk,This is a fantastic free tourist facility which is a memorial to all Diggers from the Hunter area with names of all who died cut into solid steel cutouts of Diggers. Access is disable friendly and also presents a magnificent view of World Class Newcastle and it’s beautiful beaches. A must see in Newcastle.
166,Mrs,This gave a wonderful insight into Newcastle's varied history and places of beauty.The park along the foreshore was exceptional.
167,Amazing walk especially during Whale migration,We took friends from overseas to see the lookout and walk along the Memorial Walk. They were fascinated by the information provided and enjoyed the natural beauty of the coast that goes with it. Some of the writing is starting to fade and we hope that the Council put effort in to maintaining and restoring it so that it can continue to be enjoyed.
168,Memorial walk,"A tribute to our fallen war heroes.Newcastle Memorial walk is a scenic, man made walk from the top of Memorial Drive over the beach side cliff down to Bar Beach and on to Merewether Beach. Don’t forget to look over the city side as well to view the industry side of the city which forms a vital part of the town’s livelihood. Beautiful any time of the day or night."
169,Stunning coastal walk,"Whale watching, rock fisher people watching, surfer watching and beach watching; it has heaps to see.   And then there is the view of the city.   A nice long and hilly walk to keep you fit too. A must to do."
170,Beautiful sight over the city and sea,"The Anzac Bridge at Newcastle can be incorporated into a longer coastal walk, or the bridge walk itself is rewarding and not very long. The views are magnificent, particularly at sunset! It's a perfect spot for whale watching too. The steps are gently, so even if you have some mobility issues they may be achievable. The rise is gentle, each step is low, and there are rest platforms between short blocks of steps. Not too tiring. If you cant do steps at all you can still do it. Enter from the north end carpark (Newcastle Beach side) and just experience the bridge."
171,A Thoughful Walk with a Great View,"A must see for anyone visiting Newcastle. to get a better understanding and appreciation of both the beaches and the city while paying tribute to all of the soldiers who served to protect areas such as this. Incredible both by day and by night. With a signed car park at the top of the walk for easy access and a series of informational signs along the way, this location is sure to help people find and appreciate their surroundings."
172,Great view,A great place to go when you want to have a fun and be connect with nature.I highly recommend to walk across.
173,A fitting tribute to our War Heroes,It’s so nice to have our own memorial walk in Newcastle and you can take your time reading as you cross the bridge
174,Anzac walk,"Very moving tribute to those that gave their all. And what a view , look out for whales breaching. Take your binoculars"
175,A bridge walk with a view,"Great view, lovely walk but very disappointed that you aren't allowed to take dogs. I enjoy regularly walking my dog along the stretch of coastline but because there's no dog signs I have to miss out and walk up along the road."
176,Great walk along beaches,Nice walk interesting history Lots of detailed information on WW1Pleasant walk for families with kidsYoung and older ones
177,lovely views,Went for this walk at night. It offers a pretty scenic view of the skies since it is filled full of stars
178,Full moon walk,"this is a must do walk if you are going to or driving through Newcastle.  it's basically a artistically and aesthetically designed steel bridge which hugs the ocean on one side with views of the city on the other.  Alongside are historical memories and short writeup on the fallen soldiers. this bridge goes over the road below and you can then continue alongside the promenade or corniche should you want to walk, run or jog along the almost 10km from harbour to beach.. please note that dogs are not allowed on this bridge so if you have one you  may need to leave them tied before the walk bridge and return to fetch them and then walk along the pavement to the beach . during the day the simple vastness of the ocean intimidates one and the views are simply awesome. At sunset you catch an amazing view from this vantage point.   it also gives you one a sense of the size of Newcastle which has grown with several well established residential suburbs very closer to the several beaches and the working harbour."
179,Breathtaking,"Built a few years ago. Starting from Strezlecki lookout.  Great views of the coast. Along Dixon Park,  Bar Beach and Merewether beaches."
180,Beautiful Views - Beautiful NEWCASTLE NSW,Extremely awesome views and fantastic walk very breath taking well worth a walk took my son for a walk we both enjoyed the day also got to see some amazing para gliders from the top end of the walk
181,Beautiful View,Lovely easy walk from strezlecki lookout across the headland towards bar beach.  Great historical information along the way about our local heroes and a Vance to find your family name. A truly great place to walk and take in the views of some of Newcastle’s amazing coastline and beaches.
182,Beautiful scenery,We visited the foreshore on a day trip to Newcastle. It’s a really lovely walk and although we didn’t walk the whole distance it was refreshing to be out in the fresh air and next to the water.
183,So amazing!,Very exciting place. Great view of the ocean can been seen. Go alone or with a friend. Historically important to Australia.
184,Outstanding Views of the Coast,Great walk the stairs could be a bit of a challenge for older people but if you start at the top of the walk there is no need to go down the stairs. On our visit we seen lots of whales.
185,Great overview of a Gorgeous Coastal City.,"One of the best walks in Newcastle with a beautiful memorialised tribute to the 100th anniversary of the ANZAC landing at Gallipoli in 1915, the commencement of steel making in Newcastle.An amazing memorial to the men and women of the Hunter who served their community and their country."
186,Reflect,Lovely walk with beautiful beach scenery. Wide boulevard style pavement. There is a very steep hill but the views are worth it!
187,No1 must do in Newcastle ,"Have visited a couple of time with overseas visitors, it really showcases the beautiful beaches we have and you also get a great view of the city Great for anyone interested in WW1, things to read along the way.Well worth a visit if you are visiting Newcastle."
188,Breathtaking Views and a photographers Dream.,Hold on to your hat people as it can get windy at times what a magnificent activityFor families to learn some history and enjoy the walk
189,Outstanding land mark,"From this incredible structure in our city that offers up breathtaking views of our beautiful coastline and on the morning we went, we got the added bonus of watching whales swimming in close heading north. Even on a drizzling weekend morning this was still fantastic."
190,Beautiful view,"I guess the idea was the make a walkway that was also a landmark when this was designed.  The views are certainly good, and it's a good connection between King Edward Park and Bar Beach. The bridge itself really dominates the cliff top landscape however and the ANZAC memorial elements are not at all subtle."
191,"VIEWS, WHALES, DOLPHINS AND BREEZES","Lovely walk that don’t need to finish at the bottom of the steps, can carry on through to Merewether beach.Some fantastic views of both the city and the shore line. The memorial structures will grab your attention for as long as you wish. Why they made it from std steel and not stainless is beyond me, therefore the steel uprights are badly corroded and staining the floor making the place look very untidy NOT rustic in any way."
192,Worthwhile visit,"What views! I waked from our accomodation across this walk to the next beach. And back. Great views and the historical walk bridge or only rewarded you with views in eve direction, the memorial was war memorial and information was beautiful. Water fountains provided which was great. A must if you are visiting this area"
193,Walk with a view,Lovely view of Newcastle here and a great reminder of the Anzacs. They risked their life’s for our future
194,Beautiful View at Sunset,Went on a very blustery Saturday morning.  Spectacular views and poignant tributes.  Highly recommend.... even with moody teenagers!
195,Best view in town,This is a great walk.  If you are unable to do stairs park at the top and you can easily walk out and take in the breathtaking views.  Alternatively park at Bar Beach and get some exercise.  You can continue the walk down through King Edward Park to have a look and a dip in the  Bogie Hole baths.
196,scenic walk,"The ANZAC walk is a must do for anyone visiting Newcastle who wants to see the rugged beauty of our coastline.  It’s very well constructed with a rememberance theme commemorating the sacrifice made by our soldiers. The walkway is very wide and has a number of good viewing platforms.  For the less energetic or those hosting elderly or disabled guests I suggest parking at the top and walking the top half only. The lower half has many stairs spread over approximately 100m and whilst very safe, requires reasonable exertion to climb."
197,Wow,A beautiful location right beside the Pacific Ocean that also honors the veterans of the region.  This coastal walk is connected along the coast in bit directions and shows off the beauty of what is a revitalized city that offers so much to its visitors and those of us that choose to live in the wonderful coastal city
198,Anzac Walk is a Newcastle Must,A wonderful memorial to our service people that takes advantage of great views down the coast line . A second bonus is you get to witness brave people jumping off the cliff for hand gliding ... too much excitement.
199,Brilliant,I took some Victorian’s there and we all thought it was wonderful even saw a whale below. So well done history wise and construction wise
200,Great View,This is an amazing place to visit. With 360 degree views of this wonderful city. It is much better with good weather
201,Stunning (bridge and views),"Well - was not expecting this!  What a beautiful place.  Walked along the beach - amazing!  We were only there one day as part of a cruise, but could imagine spending a couple of good days here.  Highlight was when our cruise ship left, there was a gun salute, people in canoes alongside ship, and people waving from shore.  An wonderful end to a wonderful day."
202,Must see,"Fantastic walk, but not long enough. You really need to walk around the house at the end of the walk and extend it past the Shepherd's Fort and the bogey hole on onto Newcastle beach. If you want more of a challenge try jogging it."
203,One of the best,"This is a lovely walk...take a drink and your camera...some get photo's can be taken. We all enjoyed this walk ages are 64,47,48.fitness level medium. You can stop along way and rest if you need. We all very much enjoyed this beautiful walk"
204,Amazing views,The view from here was absolutely fantastic: city lights & stars. Definitely worth to look at especially at night.What a beautiful place as a memorial.
205,Lovely views,"This is a must for everyone. It’s free, easy to get to, and has beautiful ire’s of the ocean. We saw heaps of whales today as well!"
206,Fab,"A great little walk with stunning views, we even saw whales the day we were there! The kids thought it was great!"
207,Pleasant thought evoking stroll,The very best view if you want to take a morning walk. If your lucky you might be able to see som whales playing in the ocean
208,Poignant memorial,"Recently we had visitors and they had not explored Newcastle before.  We took them to the Anzac Memorial Walk - its a very easy walk when you park in the top carpark (disabled parking available). If you want more adventure park, in the bottom park and walk up.  This is a memorial to ANZAC veterans. Yes I have some relations engraved on the beautiful sculptured wall. We were there on a beautiful clear day - on one side of the walk is the sea where we saw dolphins swimming, stingrays swimming, people fishing and even a shark.  On the other side of the walk is an outstanding view of Newcastle which takes in the harbour, Christ Church Cathedral and a wonderful view of Newcastle.  On the day we were there we also watched hand gliders. It is free, and if you go during the week very quiet.  A worthwhile visit if you want to get a scenic view of Newcastle and respect our ANZAC's."
209,THIS IS HISTORY,Wwalking along above the clifftops gives amazing views in every direction.  As a special bonus we got to see multiple pods of whales just off the coast.  The historic information along the ANZAZ memorial walk is very interesting and to continue walking along the coast or back along the Terraces makes for a good outing.
210,A Great Walk!,The Day was perfect and the walk was a must see for a visit to the city by some friends from Japan.The view was spectacular and the visitors said it was one of the highlights of their visit to Australia .We accept it and many enjoy it regularly but It should be visited by all who we wekvonevtobtge city!
211,Great walk,"A spectacular view of our sensational coastline!A sensitive,poignant tribute to such brave souls.For the fit,include the NMW in a hike.We love starting here or Merewether beach and back.The flights of stairs are an added challenge to a workout.👍Conversely,we have taken our aged parents to the car park and they can manage a little stroll on the level surface as far as they can manage.A memorable experience for them as they grew up here."
212,Must do walk,"wonderful way to spend the morning looking at newcastle's premier beaches, even better to watch the sunrise"
213,A “Newy”must see/do!,"Scenic short coastal walk suitable for all ages, whilst receiving a first world war history lesson that most importantly recognises the diggers who served Australia in the great war."
214,Great walk,Architecturally interesting elevated short walking platform along coastal cliff top. Excellent views across the ocean and city. However the metal memorial plaques listing names of service personnel are so badly rusted they are illegible.
215,Lest We Forget,This walkway with an extended walking bridge is located between Newcastle & Merewether Beaches. The view of the Pacific Ocean is amazing & it’s not unusual to spot whales & dolphins cruising up & down the coast. Definitely worth a visit if your going to Newcastle.
216,Leisurely walks,Crappy bridge in great location.Ncc are boring people with no vision.This could have been world renowned but it's just boringSad after so much money and time spent designing and building.
217,Great View ,This has car parking at the top end although limited. Bottom end has ample parking so recommend starting this end to do the full return trip. Lots of stairs which is ok for average fitness. The top half is relatively easy going being mostly flat and wheel chair friendly. It is sign posted NO DOGS but some choose to ignore this. It has interesting information panels along the way. Allow 30 to 45 mins for bottom return trip or 20 mins for top only. However take more time and a camera.
218,View,"This is a must-do for any visitors to Newcastle. A wonderful tribute to the local men and women who died in WWI and WWII. The morning we went the wind was blowing a gale, I hate the wind, but it was so worth it! The walk way is well maintained. The views of the coastline were lovely."
219,Morning walk,"It’s free, it’s a fantastic view. Take yourself or your out of town friends to see this amazing walkway."
220,"Beautiful views, great memorial",Great beach front walks. Crashing waves. Sea pools with people swimming or dabbling in the surf in the middle of winter. Popular with many walkers. Fantastically developed and lit. Historical artifacts to keep your interest.
221,Beautiful,Short walk along with the coast. Lots of information about world War one if you are interested. Nice view of the sea.
222,A very special Memorial,View was great and family had a really good time. Beach was rather crowded but very tempting with its crystal clear water. Worth the visit!
223,Awesome views with  bit of history,"We drove to Newcastle to find a good beach for a swim. On the way, we found a hill with lots of stairs to walk up to. Since we were there and we must stop to check it out. It is was a good walk up Cooks Hill. Interesting history and excellent panorama. No shortage of water fountain to keep you hydrated until the top for the fantastic view."
224,MUST DO when visiting newcastle,Great small tribute & great detail... only a 400-500m so short n worth it...A must see n do..esp in the sun looking over the waves n water....
225,Stunning views great for kids.,The Memorial Walk itself is not very long but it joins on to a longer track along the coast. There is a small parking area at the Northern end of the walk which makes it much easier to access the walk without having to climb any stairs.It is a great tribute to those who served in the armed forces.Worth doing the walk just for the views.
226,Awesome views,Completed walk just on sunset it is an inspiring experience. The walk is a true dedication to the servicemen who have served this country. It is the perfect spot to watch the sunset over Newcastle or the Sunrise.Well worth exploring. we walked there from Newcastle Beach and walk back the whole experience is worth doing again.
227,Amazing vista awaits!,"This walk incorporates war memorial signage and installations, pedestrian only bridges, and spectacular views in every direction. There is limited parking at the northern end with easy access to the path. At the southern end is a very long staircase for the fit only.The only negative is the scary amount of flex and bounce on the bridges. Many would find it very disturbing, They won’t fall down but you do start to wonder. I think they need to install some dampers to reduce the movement, both the amplitude and frequency."
228,Scenic walk paying homage to our fallen soldiers ,We parked at the strzelecki lookout car park and walked along the bridge. It was a most beautiful walk with acknowledgements to the great wars.
229,Must visit if you are in Newcastle,I booked a Tour with Orsum Trike Tours and had so much fun.  The experience ws professional and the scenery was outstanding.
230,Favorite walk in Newcastle,"The view is fantastic. However, it is worth pausing to read the information, which properly lists local service men and women. Leave plenty of time to stop and read, but enjoy he view too."
231,A  very scenic walk,What an amazing walk! Walk here from Newcastle Surf Club before breakfast. Once you get back to the surf club you will have earned a coffee at least
232,Gorgeous views,"This walk is unusual in that it is an elegantly constructed series of bridges and steps built for the 100th ANZC anniversary. One end requires plenty of steps from the beach, the other end fully assessable. The vows from the upper level are stunning. Well worth visiting."
233,Nice view at night,The Newcastle Memorial Walk Memorial Drive Merewether. Part of the coastal walk traversing Newcastle's beaches. Commemorates those who served in WWI. Information panels along the walk provide historical information. As the walk is elevated theft a spectacular views of the ocean and beaches and the City. Cautionary note whilst the north entry point is easily accessible the south exit point is comprised of multiple staircases some quite steep.
234,What a place! ,"With some Newcastle friends, we rode bikes from the Harbour to Merewether. The Newcastle Memorial Walk was an interesting attraction along the way. Newcastle has the reputation for being an industrial city but the centre has been developed and beautified a lot. There are some great cycle tracks. We will be back!"
235,Interesting hustory,We spent some time walking along this memorial while in Newcastle.It was beautifully designed with the ocean on one side and views over the city on the other.I very touching tribute to the fallen.
236,Memorial Walk,We walked with our 10 and 12 year olds from Merewether Baths taking in the coastal views and culminating in the Newcastle memorial walk! It wasn’t too strenuous on a mid 20 degree day! Stunning views and the memorial was a wonderful tribute.
237,Memorial Walk Bar Beach,"What a great memorial. Aside from the architectural build, the fantastic view just adds to the whole experience.Get fit while taking in some history and views"
238,Memorial Walk - Newcastle,"What a wonderful asset for the city. The views to the south ,east ,west and north are truly spectacular . Stop along the walk and reflect as well."
239,Newcastle Memorial Walk,"Absolutely loved our few days in Newcastle! After a big breakfast, we needed a good walk! This was such a surprise! Views where spectacular! We walked from the harbour to Merewether Beach.Do it on a glorious day , it was a great way to walk off breakfast!"
240,Breathtaking coastal. Iews,"A lovely beachwalk dedicated to the memory of those that gave their lives for this country.

241,Heroes memorial walk,"How great is this walk, if you’re a visitor in Newcastle I suggest you go and do this walk. Wonderful views and story."
242,Amazing.,"Beautiful views of the coast, and a very informative reminder of the sacrifices made during WW1.There is limited parking, but if you wait people are constantly leaving"
243,A wonderful walk,was looking for beachside parking but then finally somehow arrived at this place and it was a very nice place.  looking to one side you see the water and turn your head to the other direction you see a city of lights ( evening time). nice walk.
244,Adventure ,"A short drive from the middle of town to the Memorial Walk, car parking available, no charge. The walk is along a cantilevered steel structure along the top of the rock cliffs, accessible to wheelchairs, great views of the ocean (whale watching and hand gliding) also along the beach south to Mereweather"
245,Great views over Newcastle coast and city,"Visited on Thursday 14th February. This is a brilliant way to honour our War Heroes, we only did a part of the walk but if you have the time make sure you do it all."
246,Good walk,This walk showcases the picturesque coastline south of Newcastle CBD and acts as a memorial to all the soldiers recruited from the Hunter who died in World War 1. There are plaques to describe some of the battles and the history of how the walk came into being.
247,Breathtaking view,"Go when the whales are migrating , you will see some amazing sights. and summer is a good time to do the walk also , smell the salt air and if its a fine day you see for miles."
248,A visitor from overseas ,"Sun shining, birds chirping, waves crashing below! What more could you ask for? Nothing, one of the worlds truly beautiful places :)"
249,Good views but obtrusive ,We planned to do this walk at sunset which was beautiful. I think it would be as good from the other direction for sunrise too.
250,Stunning walk over spectacular coast,"We had a little time to kill so thought would be an interesting morning.There is a lot of war history,we were also treated to a pod of whales passing by an added bonus"
251,Excellent walkway & Tribute,"Newcas is a modern vibrant city catering to business people, families, students, visitors.This memorial walk is part of a wonderful walk thought the past and the present of this lovely cityA great way to keep fit as well"
252,Great Newcastle walk,"As all other reviwers said, practically this is the must do while visiting Newcastle. There are numerous photo spots where you can get amazing landscape clicks and the whole walk up to the coast line is really beautiful."
253,Great view of Ndewcastle coastline,Great views marvelllous construction wonderful way to remember our past and celebrate  our men and women who have served our country

255,Jones,"My family and I were driving from Newcastle city to Meriweather beach and we saw this Coll looking elevated walk.We checked it out, great views and some history of our diggers. Easy for any fitness level"
256,A wonderful elevated walk with spectacular views,The  Memorial walk is an elevated pathway along the edge of a cliff in the  1 km from the heart of Newcastle. On one side is spectacular coastal views and the other side is great views of the city centre and harbour. An hour is plenty of time to drive to the Strezlecki lookout  and walk and do the return walk.   It is part of the Bathersway coastal walk from the the city centre to Merewether beach. Lots of  sandy beaches and opportunities for coffee along the way. Total time would be 3 hours return
257,Great tribute to Australian WWI heroes! ,"This is a must do and can be as long or as short a walk as you are capable of.As there many many parking areas along the walk you can drive walk around and drive on, Wales, boats, tankers, surfers, hang gliders, all kinds of bird life abound.Take in rugged coast and sprawling beach’s, excellent surf shop cafes every beach club and there are 4-5 along the wayAs I said a must do I do it every week."
258,The Best Walk in Newcastle,Definitely worth going for a stroll along the Memorial boardwalk. The view that it offers is absolutely beautiful.
259,Must visit in Newcastle ,Wonderful walk as a memorial to the brave soldiers who lost their lives for Australia. Placed in an area which shows the wonderful beaches and city views of Newcastle. Well worth the visit to this site.
260,Great walk ,Stress free. Costs also free. Bring your camera. Check out the Memorial plackard to see if your family name is on the list.
261,Family day out with glorious views,"This was my second visit and I was just as impressed with the elevated iron walkway, the cliff vantage points, and the stunning view down the coast towards Dudley and Redhead in the distance.  We walked up from Bar Beach on a glorious Sunday and were treated to watching the hang gliders launch from the cliff top and glide past the walkway."
262,Walk of memories and beautiful views,One of the most scenic walks I have ever had the pleasure of doing.  The history lesson along the way is well worth the read.
263,A must do.,Only did a short walk here which was at night but from what we saw was very good. If we had had more time woiuld have done properly. At night you could see the whole city.
264,Beautiful walk,We didn't know about this wonderful walk and came onto it by chance. What a great job has been done. It is a moving experience reading the names and stories of those people. The information about the conflicts is very well presented. This is a must do if visiting the area. Of course the views are awesome.
265,An absolute gem of a place,"Great bit if exercise, parked at Merewether and walked along the front, up the memorial walk and back.Awesome track and views. Thoroughly recommend.Only disappointing point for us was the amount of rust forming, think the council should have used better more durable materials than they did. Maybe it’s a ‘period’ thing or some expression of the age. However, it will only be a few years before sections will need replacing!!All in all, a great gesture and certainly worth the effort to go look 👌👌"
266,Disappointing that dogs aren't allowed ,"Did this walk with my 80 year old father. He struggled on some of the hills but perservered as he was enjoying it too much to stop. Great walk, loads of amazing vistas, and plenty of cafes to stop along the way."
267,A walk along memorry lane,A well paved walk that is a memorial to those men & women who enlisted in World War I.  There are incredible views of the Newcastle coastline.
268,Great walking trail and superb views,On the windswept bridge stands a line of soldiers in profile. The sea that they crossed and were never to return to their homeland stretches out for eternity.Names are etched along the walk of the fallen heroes.Words are not needed
269,Amazing views!,We first time stop over in Newcastle . So beautiful ocean view from the Memorial walk . Surprises me there is big fish passing by .... very excited the whale. Very happy
270,ANZAC Walk,"We loved this coastal walk. We started at Merewether ocean baths and walked up to the end of memorial walk and then back again. Sensational views of ocean / city. Breaching whales, surfers and a well thought out Anzac memorial."
271,great addition to Newy,great views along with the memorial of the men and women how have fallen in battle for Australia who resided in the Newcastle area
272,Well worth it .,The scenery is absolutely breathtaking. Gorgeous at any time of the day but particular at sunset. Really enjoy this walk
273,Newys best walk,A very enjoyable walk - it was the first time back to Newcastle in over 20 years and I really enjoyed both the walk and Newcastle in general
274,Great views,"One of the must sees in Newcastle and a good spot for a workout if you are inclined, pardon the pun, to climb the hill or stairs from the Bar Beach carpark below.Either way the spectacle is remarkable on any day and in any weather.Poignant memorials of the ANZACS round out the walk that has everything.Accessible by wheelchair from the top at Strezlecki Lookout."
275,Lovelly elevated coastal walk with historical significance,Walkway has been built to honour the ANZACs who served in World War 1. It consists of a long walkway with a series of well-graded steps which wrap around the hilltop above the cliffs and beaches above Bar Beach. It is well used by locals and tourists for sightseeing and exercise and has commanding views of the ocean and beaches. It is all age accessible and has return access from one end for wheelchairs. The stairs prohibit access from the south end. Parking is available at the north and south ends. The walk is part of a coastal work from Newcastle southwards along the beach front.
276,Newcastle Memorial Walk,"If your in town make the effort and head out and stretch the legs and get the heart rate going,Beautiful outlooks up and down the coast."
277,Spectacular ANZAC Walk,"Veiws are 180 degrees and you can Whale watch at the right time of the year.Look out across city of Newcastle to Stockton beach and bridge, veiws of coal ships waiting to be loaded.On a Clear sunny day great photo opportunities"
278,"Great Views, Great Heritage","A stroll along this beautiful walkway had me feeling many emotions.  Gratitude & immense respect for the 1000's of military who fought for our freedom, enjoyment of the beautiful views of the coast & the tranquility of the area in general. I imagine an ANZAC service conducted in the area would be extraordinary. So glad I was finally able to visit."
279,Must see in Newcastle!,It is truly humbling to walk and remember the people that made it possible for us to have our freedom and way of life. The view is nothing short of captivating. From the whales to the ships waiting to port and white sandy beaches from start to finish. Thank you to all the men and women who died to save a wretch like me and let me see such a beautiful place.
280,Surprise ,"You can't get a better afternoon walk in Newcastle. Right down along the beach, watching the sun go down. How good!"
281,See how this great country's culture has been protected for all to enjoy,"We incorporated this into a longer walk starting at the Queens Wharf (ferry to Stockton) around to Nobby's Beach, then on to Newcastle Beach, up through King Edward Park to the start of the Memorial Walk and down to Dixon Park Beach then back to the Queens wharf along Darby Street.                                                                                  The Memorial Walk was busy with lots of traffic however the views along the clifftop were amazing. We saw whales and 3 large pods of Dolphins trying to catch the waves before the surfboard riders could. We also had a lovely sunny day which made it even more enjoyable."
282,Great place for a walk. Fantastic atmosphere and amazing scenery!,This is a regular for us. We often spot dolphins and whales (during migration). Best to do it on a sunny calm day as it has been known to claim a hat or two!
283,Memorial walk,This walk stretches from Merewether Beach all the way to Nobby's Head.  The memorial portion is a fitting tribute to our servicemen and women.The views are spectacular.I would recommend downloading the map of the walk which provides a great deal of insight into the fascinating geology you will see along the way.
284,Big day out,"Been meaning to do the walk for ages and finally got around to it. Wasn’t disappointed. Newcastle often tends to do half baked projects but this one is really good. Could have spent more time to read more of the stories. Start at the top and don’t go all the way to the bottom if you want to avoid the stained section, however, we started and finished from the bottom and it’s not that taxing at all."
285,Spectacular views South over the Beaches and headlands,Did this as part of a walk from Merewether to Nobbys Beach. It’s a fairly easy walk that rewards you with beautiful views and some tasteful war memorial exhibits.
286,Spectacular views,"Recently walked this walkway which has an excellent Tribute to the men & women of Newcastle who served their country in WW 1. It has magnificent views out to the Ocean and South along the coastline. The top car park also has a Digital car space indicator, thus making parking easier."
287,Beautiful scenic walkway ,"We only seem to visit when we have somebody visiting us, which is always the case.  Amazing views and great history to read along the way."
288,Well worth a visit,We went for a walk before breakfast and this was the highlight. I suggest starting at the northern end.
289,Afternoon stroll,"Great little walk and a great memorial to all the brave souls who fought for our country, lest we forget."
290,Fabulous,"Take the time to do this walk,  you won't be disappointed especially at this time of year you might just see a whale or two."
291,Wonderful views,"First visit to Newcastle first thing we did was head to the beach. after some lunch & down time the kids wanted to head back so we parked at the start of the walk & headed down. The views were spectacular, the walk easy and around 10 mins. If you ask my little one the stairs back were a bit painful 😂"
292,An amazing structure,"Well done and definitely worth a look. We cruised along here at night time before going out to dinner, and glad we did."
293,Beautiful location ,"I'm a bit bias regarding this walk, my two great uncles appear on the walk as they both fort at Gallipoli. (Shearman) But the walk itself is fantastic, what a view, what great exercise. If you walk in the mornings you will see dolphins and maybe Wales playing. Not only this, the walk is situated at Bar Beach one of the best beaches along with Merewether Beach in Australia. And Australia has the best beaches in the World. And I grew up in Bar Beach, so I recommend it to any visitors."
294,Great views,A lovely walk that makes you appreciate the sacrifices that the men and women of our country have made for us.
295,Took Perth visitors,Very Moving but neighbors hear wind noises when wind is blowing from the South east.Almost like a ghouls call
296,Amazing views,"As a Hire Car Driver , I often take my Guests here for a quick look at the city. On one side it shows some of our magnificent Beaches and the other direction The City , our working Harbour and beyond to more Beaches. Hard to beat anywhere. Well worth the visit to get a layout of things. Go to the High Point of the lookout 1st if you are short on time and don’t want to walk far."
297,Stunning views,"This walk will always hold a special place in my heart. I walked this Memorial Walk with my son. I had just relocated him to Newcastle as he was due to commence University. We commenced our walk at the top of the headland and inhaled the breathtaking coastal view. The walk is incredible, such a tribute to Newcastle. So well laid out and beautifully situated. This is an absolute "" MUST DO"" when in Newcastle. In fact, you will want to do this walk again and again. Make sure you take your camera, it is a photographers DREAM!! :))"
298,A must do in Newcastle,"The Newcastle Memorial Walk was inaugurated on the 100th ANZAC day celebration on April 25, 2015. Along the boardwalk, the soldiers’ cutouts on both sides of the walk are engraved with the surnames of the 3859 servicemen enlisted during the WWI with a chronology of battles they were involved in, and other stories about Naval, Military, Aviation, Light Horse and Nursing Services during WWI. Take your time in reading stories of those braves, men & women, who sacrificed their lives for the country!We started 450 meters long boardwalk from the south end and loved it so much that we didn't stop at Bar Beach, where boardwalk ends, but continued all the way to the Merewether beach till the cliff side. The whole course will require a bit of fitness level but you don't have to be a super athlete. However, the boardwalk surface is spongy with small holes, hence ladies with high-heels will have difficulty walking. You will see a wonderful 360 views of the Pacific Ocean & beach on one side and the bustling Newcastle city on the other. It's advisable to park your car at the north end (Bar Beach) where the comparatively spacious parking lot is available. Some people have been complaining in their reviews that the NMW management doesn't allow accompanying their dogs, once you get onto that boardwalk you will see the sense and appreciate the decision. The sunset view was amazingly spectacular, I am sure the sunrise would be just as grand."
299,Breathtaking,"Built to honor those from Newcastle who served in The Great War and the 100th  anniversary of the BHP steel mill, the walk is an informative stroll with breathtaking views of the Pacific and the City. Walk it for the views and honor those who served."
