0,You will fall in love with nature 🌿,"This place is just like a Heaven you won’t believe what I felt after visiting this place, This place is very close to Fort aguada I visited this place multiple time and I never regret. Attach pictures will give you exact explanation what I felt. This is just outstanding define lot of Greenery Rock and see all together."
1,Best place ,A perfect dream to live its a very old fort and the scenic beauty is a sight to experience A must see for all those coming here
2,Great view,This is one place with great view. More than the fort the view excited me.  The fort is decent enough.
3,Beautiful view,I had been to Goa many times but had never visited this place. I simply loved it. this place is  well maintained and is Scenic by the sea with beautiful view all across
4,450 years of INDO-PORTUGUESE RULE !!!,"Personally, there is nothing great that I could see at this place. One can get to see the view of the sea from the top. Again I see broken beer bottles on the rocks. Probably you can click a few pictures there and apart from it, I don't see any major attraction."
5,Nothing to see,"Nothing special about this fort, if you have visited forts at other places like rajasthan.It was hot day and I wasted 1 hour there. The only attraction is view of sea form top of the fort."
6,Seaside Fort.,If you are interested in fort and history then this place will definitely excite you.Its very peaceful place river view from the top is awesome.
7,on the beach,We have visited the Fort and this was really nice. Very old but we'll build. There is a nice view to nature and sea. Nice place.
8,Ridiculous fee,This is just an average place. Fort is not particularly artistic or beautiful. Only good thing is the view that it gives of the sea.
9,Ok ok,"The best time to visit this place is right now,  little breeze and romantic weather waking you up and the greenary calming your soul, mind will be in peace as it's sea shore. Awesome place to walk in nature, Love this place."
10,Majestic fort at the mouth of Mandovi river in North Goa,Its another Fort in India i understand it is nice but is it exceptional absolutely not so i would rate it as average and another fort which you can skip if you have been to Rajasthan.
11,Who did this?,I m extremely shocked that such a historic place with no maintenance and no guides available no information on sitesIt was my biggest mistake I wasted a day in Goa for this site Plz don't go thereThe route doesn't have  any directions to reach thereThe parking operators are taking 50/- for parking very high ratesThe entry ticket for Indians is 25/- and for outsiders 300/-When u enter it's just a unmaintained fort with all over heat of sunlight no information on points no guides availableMy recommendation is to not waste a day for it
12,Nice little hilltop seaside fort,Location is really breathtaking. Getting there was bit strenuous .. But once there it was really nice experience.  Too much food waste and garbage around. But still it a place worth visiting.
13,Fort Aguada - Historical place.,"This fort in Goa has so much to see. Starting from the lighthouse to the prison cells to the exquisite view of the Arabian sea, its simply beautiful. Although, what remains now are just unpainted remains of the rocks, it is an important place of visit to those who have keen interest for historical places."
14,Keep some time and Complete it slowly,We visited on a hot afternoon so probably did not enjoy the visit too much. It is an enormous fort and completely made out of the local laterite stone overlooking the ocean.It is filled with tourists so try to go during off season. It is definitely historic but can be missed if lacking time.
15,Underwhelming,"There are so many forts to visit in Goa and around, but this one was my favourite! Nice walk and view. Relatively well maintained and big enough to spend some nice time! Second favourite if I can include Mirjan fort near Gokarna (though this one is worth it mostly in rainy season when it's covered in greenery)."
16,"Poor Upkeep, Unexciting",If you are visiting Goa for the first time it is a good place to visit once. View from the fort is beautiful. Not for people with walking difficulties.
17,Fort,This place is magically beautiful.  Just right next to the fort there's a way which goes inside to the sunset point which is 5 minutes walk.  The scenic beauty is always hiding behind the fort from the point you can also see the whole beach area.
18,Worth a visit,This is a very old and famous fort of Goa. This was very near from our hotel. A historic place and good to visit with friends.
19,Overview of History,The view here is the most people love.. you will get the great of the sea and try to carry the water bottles.
20,Fort,This is lovely place and the air that blows here is so cool. The entry to lighthouse is not allowed but otherwise a good place to roam around and see beautiful view.
21,Amazing,Must see fort if you are in Goa.  One of the largest I have seen among Portuguese built forts in Goa.You can see beautiful view of Mandovi river on one side and a breathtaking view of Arabian sea on adjacent side...truly a sight to behold !
22,Nice place if you are in the area,No doubt this place is thriving with tourists it's a nice place to visit if you are interested in the history of Goa. It can get really hot and sunny so don't forget to put on a lot of sunblock lotion and wear your hat and sunglasses. It is advisable to wear comfy shoes as well if you intend to walk to all corners of the fort.
23,Glory of Portugese empire - Excellent Sight seeing,"We were staying at Taj fort so it is very near by and hence we visited the fort several times, the view is amazing from this place"
24,"Visit to upper Fort Aguada,Goa",The fort is about 100 metres inside the sea so its a good experience once you reach the end... the fort itself is not kept well at all and is quite dirty with beer bottles littered.. no provision for dustbins to avoid this
25,Interesting historical place ,We entered this place thirty mins before the shutdown. It’s a lovely fort with scenic views of the sea. The backdrop of the lighthouse provides for some good pics Instagrammable location !
26,Goa's iconic landmark,"Just an old fort, technically just the boundary of the fort exists. If one has visited Rajasthan, then this fort stands no where near. So, nothing special about it. Only good thing is the nice view of the ocean which provides a perfect background for taking pictures. Also, basic facilities need to be improved at the site.."
27,Terribel,"Worth a trip here when you're in Goa ,  the architecture is absolutely beautiful but the best of all is the view"
28,nice fort to click photos,"This place is just too beautiful. The fort is very ancient and it's structure is very massive. There is beach surrounding the fort and that's what looks amazing. Surrounded by greenary and beach, it is just not possible to miss this place."
29,Nice Small Sea facing Fort,It’s old and beautiful. It’s a perfect romantic spot and a fishing spot! You can take really fantastic pictures here cause the view from the fort is amazing. Extremely beautiful during sunrise and sunset.
30,Only visit if you have extra time ...!!!,"This is really different than the forts we are accostomed to seeing in North India, build by the Mughals or the Rajputs. It has a nice feel to it, though the maintenance could have been better."
31,Nice view from fort,Fort Aguada has some good breath taking views of the Ocean! It also offers one of the great Sunsets and is a tourist spot. One of the must site visits in North Goa!
32,Instagram worthy location ,I believe this place is highly hyped as being one of the best tourist attraction of Goa. We were bit disappointed with this place and though we could have given it a miss. Nothing much to see except you can click few selfies/ snaps. Please do avoid it on sunny day for sure.
33,Light house,"This is tourist place that is a must visit. Mainly because of the architecture and the surrounding that this fort was purpose built for. To provide fresh water to ships that docked hence the name ""aguada"" which means watering place in Portuguese.Visitors can park their vehicle in the designated parking area and take a nice walk to the fort. One can visit the lower levels and take the stairs to come near the lighthouse. Walk around the ramparts and get a sense of how this fort would have worked both as a lighthouse, a watering place and a storage for ammunition. Get scenic view of the Arabian Sea while overlooking the Sinquerim beach. There is nothing much to look at in this fort compound however the well-preserved fort is a welcome change to the numerous ruins of Portuguese forts that one get to witnesses. You can spend an hour easily in this fortified area and have a small picnic in the garden under the shade of the trees. And later visit the"
34,Old fort with nice view...,"There is nothing great or nor it’s a very huge fort , But it is quite famous in Goa for sightseeing . It will hardly take u 20-25 min including capturing the pictures to roam through the fort. So if time permits u can pay a visit there. To follow me on Instagram - @divyafoodaholic"
35,Old Fort,"This fort can be visited for its historical value. The place was crowded when we visited , may be because it is free. The place is not worth your time  if you are on a very short visit to Goa."
36,NO PROPER MAINTENANCE ,Amazing road trip to the fort and fantastic architecture...what a view..it was a great romantic place....I loved the trip...thru Mandovi riverside
37,Waste of money,I had visited in the afternoon. Had clear sky and the scenery was beautiful. It was a good place to visit with wife. Took lots of pics and enjoyed ourselves.
38,Portuguese Built Fort,Historically very interesting to know the reason the fort was built. Must try to understand the history behind it while visiting the fort. U will be able to appreciate the fort only then.
39,"Interesting, but nothing great","this is  the romantic part of goa sold.with the light house.in reality,this is nothing but a courtyard surrounded by a fort wall.the light house is off bounds.so is most of the fort which is under the defence forces."
40,Not a penny worth,You must visit this place if you are planning for goa trip as the fort is in very good condition and spread in very large area. Also the scenic beauty from the walls of the fort makes the visit worth. Also the fort is well maintained and cleaned with information about its history depicted clearly.
41,Needs maintenance,"Great Architectural Wonder, with History Embedded. Need time if you want to explore and hear stories from guide !! Ample Parking Space, Approach Road till fort is good..!! Last 50-100 meter which one need to walk can be improved. Must Visit.. Better than Chapora Fort.!!"
42,Fort trip,This Fort is located at a very scenic place in North Goa gicing an awesome view of the Mandovi River and its confluence into Arabian Sea.The Fort has no entry fee and is always crowded with tourists.You can spend a good 2 hours here walking leisurely on the the boundry wall and get a view on all directions. We enjoyed a lot with our 3 and half years old daughter here
43,Visit to the fort ,"First off, this attraction is free to visit.  Do read the history on it as it makes it that much more interesting.  There's a moat, a lighthouse, springs that were used to supply water to the ships, thus the name, as well as great views of the Indian ocean/Arabian sea.  The current accessible area is fairly small, yet well intact, but the original fort area is very large."
44,"Nice view, but not worth 300 INR",This place has a lot of beautiful views. You will be clicking great pictures here. There is no entry fee but you need to pay for parking if you have bike or car. Spending an hour at this place will be worth . The history of this place is quite interesting.
45,Overrated and Overcrowded,This is a must visit place in Goa list if it's your first time. It's historically important and another imported thing is be on time as it's closed in evening 5:30pm. It's not a very big for but the view is amazing.
46,Good place to visit,Whenever you are in Goa specially north goa you will sometime would like to visit this place. It has perfect view of the sea from the top and amazing old structure to have a look. Nice place
47,Because its there,a big fort with lovely views 3 boards with some of the history on very popular so quite crowdedparking 30rupeeplenty of food and drink stands outside definitely not disabled friendly
48,Excellent,Nothing noteworthy about this place except its cleanliness and historical value.  Best time to visit is in the morning as the sun gets really hot later.  Closing time: 1700hrs.
49,Best best Kokum kitchen,"Visited this place with friends and was nice for once a visit kind of places. There is no formal group of organiser managing any activity or a guide to narrate the things, hence lacks the excitement. The place is clean and views are nice, but there are better places to explore in Goa if u have visited it once. Yes for families, can ignore for friends... still, if u wish to go, then read about it to avoid disappointment of being there and feel the history with knowledge."
50,A Very Small Fort,"The fort location is great as one can see great views of Sea. The history of the fort is shown at the entrance. If travelling With elders specially with people who cannot walk easily, recommend to walk slowly.There are few steps to get in the fort. There are lot of ramps so we did not had major issues.Lots of small shops out side of the fort selling hats / caps / drinks etc. The place was crowded when we visited. Worth a visit, we covered whole space in 30-45 minutes."
51,Nice broad view,My husband and Are Seniors late 70’s and 80’s and the walked stairs were worth it to venture up to the top. Great history when you start your tourist adventure up to the Light house. The gorgeous views of The a Mandovi River are a plus. No cost to explore. Wear sensible low healed walking shoes. Rough areas construction going on.
52,Sunset,We are four  go fort agonda by bike Fort is good Here you can see very amezing view of panjim and vsaco da gama.Fort is very old style. And very powerfull fort . All fort is made by black stone .But  here no parking give by fort
53,Not well maintained,The place is good..but parking charges high  and the collectors shady creatures..100rs for parking is a lot..who collects and how are these charges used for upkeep of the place is indoubt...typical red tape around the whole thing shrouded in mystery..
54,Best view of the ocean,This place is well maintained and well preserved. Walking along the fort walls is a thrilling experience and the views of the Arabian sea offers good photo opportunities. Combine this trip with water sports in aguda beach and it's a good way to spend half a day
55,View is beautiful 😍,"I couldnt visit the Lower fort, though that is more near to see, this fort is well maintained with necessary protections, gives great view of the sea , the only part of trouble is the looting of parking attenders, I think its high time officials do something about it, to view the fort ticket cost only 25/- but to part a two wheeler these hooligans charge 50/-neat, clean and well maintained."
56,Fort with light 🏠,The famous 3 window Dil Chahta spot at this place is closed for now .. you cannot go that point which use to be a the best .Though still this place is good for clicking pictures and standing by the wall watching the sea from up and a light house which is historic.Prefer going when sun is behind the clouds.You need to pay 50rs for your scooty parking .And there are shops outside for lemonade and a bit of shopping 😍
57,DIL CHAHTA HAI ,"If you are looking at a great view of the sea, this fort should definitely be on your list. Surrounded by sea on all the sides, this rustic architectural beauty has a great appeal. This massive fort was built in 1612 and has been one of the most important Portuguese construction."
58,"Good old fort with mesmerising views of the sea shore, can definitely be a lot better maintained",very not a good place for a European tourist.  Entrance for an Indian 25 Entrance for a foreigner 300. Everything is closed and is not allowed anywhere.  very bad.  nothing to watch
59,Yeah great fort ,I've always been a fan of the beautiful sea view and this fort is full of it. Women's entry was free on women's day. Piturisque place.
60,Feeling history,"It's good if you visit here by sunrise time, in that case you can view a mesmerizing sunrise in the area where people love the sunset. Many areas are under renovation so wasn't able to enjoy it properly..but yeah the route from Candolim to Aguada is lovely."
61,Fort Aguada - No facilities for sea view.,It is not a great visiting place other than if you want to get clicked at Dil chahta hai location. You can visit it if you have enough time in hand
62,Very plain,"Very interesting place. Fort is old but mostly in good condition. Views are really awesome and spectacular, we made very excellent pictures, especially I liked sunset here. There is not so crowded in evening hours. Recommend for visiting."
63,Nice place to visit,It’s not very large but has gorgeous views. I suggest going in the morning as it was hardly crowded. I would say plan on 45 minutes at most. No taxis available outside so plan your own transport to and from (otherwise you will be walking quite a distance)
64,"Well maintained fort, must visit place",Nowadays this fort looks very crowded and you will not be able to enjoy the original beauty. Fort looks best during Rainy season or starting of Winter.
65,Fort Aguada historic fort,Fort Aguada is a nice spot which can be visited once tourists take break from the lovely life around beaches of Goa. Mark in the modern history of India. This is one of the most prominent forts of Portuguese in Goa
66,Good old fort,the fort made by the portuguese is really worth the visit . it gives excellent  sea view and also the sunset view a must  for every one visiting goa and interested in history
67,Picturesque Fort,the fort was quite accessible from where we were staying...awesome views of the sea...decent peaceful walk..can spend some time there admiring the old fort
68,History of Goa detail at Fort Aguada,"Scenic view from the top of the Fort is beautiful. But it requires a little bit of maintenance as they charging an entry fee from the tourist. There is also a lack of facilities for food and drinks, near to the fort. The fort contains a large water storage tank beneath it. The charges for foreigners should be reduced as it is way too high. Also, this place also used as prison cells. But when I visited this place, they were filling up those cells permanently."
69,Parking charges,"Nice Place, Awesome fort very famous and popular tourist attraction in all seasons. The fort location is great as one can see great views of Sea. Aguada Fort Can not be missed."
70,Aguada Fort Goa,"One of my favourite place in Goa, provides nice view of sea and some very good photo spots. Road which leads towards this fort is also very scenic!! Must visit !!"
71,Fort visit,It can be skipped....no point going specially to see the fort as in a rural there is no fort just a boundary wall....
72,Magically beautiful ,It was a wonderful sea View from Fort Aguada. It was just a 2.5 kms from Taj Holiday Village Resort. We went on bike ride & enjoyed the deep 🌊 from the fort.
73,Beatiful views from this place,"I entered the fort with the expectation that history of Portuguese in India will be relived, but such was not the case. There is not much to see in the place, only thing that you will enjoy is the great views of sea that it offers. I visited the place in the month of February and it was extremely hot and exhausting. The famous light house has been painted recently in white and looks bright but it is closed for tourists. Most of the gates in the fort are closed for tourist as well, so there is not much to see. There are no charges for fort entry , only you have to pay for parking."
74,Worth Visiting.,Beautiful view of the blue water is mesmerizing along with cool breeze of the river but it is difficult to spend hours if its bright sunny day. Parking facility is available which is very expensive.
75,"Excellent view, fort is average",Lovely place with best scenery Historic place with lots of beautiful views A must visit place which is neat and tidy Only concern is the high rate entrance fee for toirist
76,Too much climb and walk though 2 wheelers are good to use,Wanted to get a glimpse of the great vista the Fort offers for my selfie album and was not disappointed.I’m disappointed that the Indian Government has not done anything to preserve and maintain this treasure or indeed to make the Fort safe for tourists to access.A quick visit for me armed with my phone to get some shots of the great views.
77,A family vacation,"Our hotel was right next to this place, but as an attraction I would not go out of my way to see it. Totally over rated and always crowded regardless of what time of day or night. I’m sure there must be better things to see and spend your time doing."
78,Marvelous sculpture ,Fort aguada is a old  light house and a famous tourist attraction has a beautiful view.Shooting fir dil chahta hai has been shoot here  .The area is huge .Nice place to visit bit crowded bit that's what famous places are like.Different place from the rest.
79,"FORT AGUDA , GOA","The fort has a beautiful view of the sea and parts of Goa. It is a great place to spend some time if there is a god wind. It was raining when I visited and there wasn't even a breeze. Since, the whole fort was wet, I couldn't sit on the stone. There is no arrangement for sitting (Of course one doesn't want to tamper with authenticity of the fort).On the way to the fort, about 100 metres before the fort, there are a couple of points which offer a good view too. U could check these out too if the fort is too crowded. There is paid parking opposite the fort which is expensive for cars.  You could park beside the approach road without blocking the road to avoid these parking charges."
80,More of a checklist,its one of the places to check if in goa due to the hype from the movies .its has nothing much to see but has gr8 view. you can relax & enjoy the breeze from the sea. this place has time limit in evening. the place is bit far so have a travel vehicle till top of mountain. overall ok to check out .
81,Quite an experience,A very beautiful and scenic spot from where one gets a cliff view of the sea. The continuous waves makes it more interesting. A must visit during visit to Goa
82,Perfect Offbeat Heritage Destination - Fort Aguada,This place is beautiful. The fort is ancient and has a massive. structure. The beach surrounds the fort and a lighthouse. A scooter is the best mode of transport as traffic jams happen frequently. There is no entry ticket you just walk around and youll see spectacular views around.
83,Nice heritage place with great view of the 🌊,We lived in Taj Fort but didn't bother to even visit..it was crowded and so not kept up properly. such properties should be preserved well by Govt and even visitors visiting should maintain it well
84,"Nice Fort, with scenic beauty","Entry fee: FreeTypical time to spend here is 2 hours for me was 10 minutes. 😂 Unfortunately for me this place was overhyped and overcrowded. The place is really nice to visit, on arrival we could not even get up the stairs to see the fort from a height as there was a family of 35 on every step they were all getting that ‘picturesque’ family photo. 💤 Going totally off topic I never see the need for a selfie to let everyone know ‘I’ve been here, here’s proof’ you don’t need a selfie for everything. The world is gone mad. Every part of this fort was really overpacked. So I couldn’t really enjoy the experience.I thought it was really cool to know there is a prison house in the fort where accused of the crimes such as abuse, drugs abuse and trafficking are lodged in. It is closed for public visits. And this jail is one of the largest jails in Goa! If your the historical type and feel you can’t miss out. Go for it. I was just passing time with the driver but would not go out of my way during my day to see this."
85,"Nice, but not all parts accessible",Beautiful spot. Lovely old red stones!  Great view of the beach from the top as well as the Taj hotel.
86,Good historic place,It was an enjoyable walk around the Fort. Nice sea views and interesting to learn about the history of the place. The stifling heat and humidity kept our visit short.
87,A bit of History,"Good old fort with mesmerising views of the sea shore, can definitely be a lot better maintained by authorities."
88,A different type,It is a very good place to visit and good picnic place with pleasant surroundings. People enjoy each and every moment. It is worth to visit.
89,17th Century Fort!!,We took a walk out to the fort about 40 minutes from the hotel. Standard old fort construction nothing spectacular but worth a trip.
90,"No entrance fees, very crowed but awesome view",Amazing view of sea and fort. we been here on sunday there is lot of visitors and some shooting was going on the day.
91,Worth a visit,good place to give break inbetweeen your visits of beaches. the story of water storage must know to get to know this place
92,There are two forts,"Rather than paying 300 rupee for foreigners, we decided to walk around the outside of the fort and found ourselves at the ‘new’ lighthouse. We paid 75 rupee for 2 people to climb a steep ladder to the top of the lighthouse, where we had excellent views back out to the fort and 360 views of Goa. Would highly recommend."
93,"Decent fort, dont go on a hot day","One time visit while to Goa. Can have a look at Portuguese Engineering of Fort (No way in Comparison with our Robust, Rigid, Un-Capturable Indian Style Engineered Fort's). Hot even in December, but good place for Photos and Selfies.So a must One Time Visit place."
94,"Fort Aquada, Goa, India, a Must to see!",This fort was made famous by Dil Chahta Hai. Fort is small and nice. Nothing which stands out as such. View form the top of the river and the sea is good. Max time to spend here is 1 hour.
95,Must see!,"The main interest of place is its historic value. Having said that, people interested in scenic beauty will also find it interesting. The place is very well maintained and they are restoring some outer walls while keeping the old shade in."
96,Average fort but great sea views!,Agoda fort is nice fort for history lovers.No entry fees.A well preserve fort made by Portuguese to guard from enemies. Very good sencic view of mandavi river from one side and Arabian Sea from other side.
97,Good visit with history,This monument  is a must for every person interested in  Architecture. A pleasure to behold.Full of mystery and majesty.
98,Boring,Amazing place but requires stamina its a vast place and steep climbs. Nice panoramic view to enjoy and click pictures.
99,What can I say... Another fort ,"Did not really learn a great deal about its history but the views alone were fantastic- free entry, worth a visit alone just for that!"
100,The Fort and Monsoons are a work of art,"This is an old Portuguese ""standard"" fort which did not appeal to me much. Though located besides the sea, the views were again quite standard. It is said that much of the beauty lies in watching the sunset - but anyway I would say you watch the sunset from any one the beaches. To me, this is not a ""must visit"" item - if you have time and have been bored with too much sea and beaches (which I wonder why will that happen ????), then you can go and visit the fort"
101,17th century garrison experience,"Historical place, with some interesting stories. Earlier used as jail and as light house. You can visit this place on Bike or Car (parking available). Prefer visit in morning or evening (particularly when it's sunny day). Plan for at least an hour; this visit involves some walk (not an issue for young folks) so plan accordingly. Near parking you'll find some stalls of tea/ snacks etc. Washroom (near main gate) is also available but it closes around 4 - 5 PM (no strict timings mentioned though). Visit with family and friends, click snaps and spend some time walking inside the fort."
102,a good way to spend an hour ,"This is a popular spot in North Goa and as its listed as a tourist spot it attracys busloads of tourists. There is nothing much left of the old fort save the sunset view and the glory is with a hotel which has taken its name!The Aguada fort is a monument to Portuguese construction and engineering. Although parts of it have fallen to the ravages of time, much of it is intact and it remains the best preserved Portuguese fort in India today. Built over three years from 1609 to 1612, it once defended the Portuguese stronghold against Dutch and Maratha invaders.It is named for the fresh water spring that gives the fort a constant supply of potable water, ‘agua’ being the Portuguese word for water and ‘Aguada’ signifying a place where water is collected. So well built and fiercely armed was this fort that it has never fallen into enemy hands."
103,Another Fort in India,Beautiful view and scenic beauty. This place is a must-visit. Just sit back and relax and enjoy the view.
104,Nice and historical fort,"Is a lovely walk to the fort from candolim, about 1 hour. We went around 9am & lots of shade from the trees. Some uphill walking near the end but we enjoyed the walk. Great for bird watching. We refused to go in when we got there once we saw the ridiculous unfair price, 25rs for Indians & 300 rs for foreigners!!   How unfair is that! It's the principal rather than the cost! We turned back & went to the jail which again was a nice walk & gave a good view of the jail & millionaires palace."
105,historic and beaautiful,"A place just for photography and for relaxation. Its best in good weather , in scorching heat you will get boiled up..."
106,Bird's eye view of goa,Aguada fort is good place for time spend there is aguada prison and a light house best for couples ........
107,A fort to remember,"This is one of the most popular place of Goa where so many bollywood songs has been pictured like Dil Chahata Hai , Singh is Blink etc. Good part of the place is No Entrance Fees and too many places to capture nice photos with friends , family and group.From the boundaries you can get the view ocean which is awesome"
108,Nothing special ,Fort aguada in senquerim in North Goa is definitely worth visiting and gives a beautiful view of the sea from the top
109,Good place,Fort Aguada is testimony to our great Indian sculptures and beautiful heritage building created with great design and passion. Great panoramic view of sea on one side with view of North Goa on other side. Must visit place
110,"Fort Aguada, Goa","The place is worth visiting for its sceneic view of sea, and sunset. Its a open space situated at a height which gives a wide view of ocean. Must visit once"
111,Best among nothing,The fort was just a open space view spot. You don't have anything other than empty space as you might get to see in any other forts in India. After all this is just a light house fort of Portuguese times. But the view of the majestic sea you get to the from the walls of the fort is really good. There is no entry fee for the place and have a huge parking space free of cost.
112,Nice views,I was inspired to visit this place after watching the popular Hindi movie-Dil Chahta hai. I saw the movie many years back and this place was on my to do list whenever i visit Goa. I must say that this place is maintained well and can be crowded during weekends. The fort offers a spectacular view of the sea and you also could view large ships sailing around. This place is definitely worth a visit.
113,Average place,its a huge fort and a nice place to click photos at various angles. Enjoyable even with large groups. Please carry a cap and sunglasses as there is a lot of open space and it can get sunny
114,Amazing view good place to visit,Fort Aguada is a must visit when in Goa.Encompassed in history it has lot to offer. The history is amazing and once the lights in lighthouse comes alive in evening it’s a surreal experience all together.It was built by Portuguese and stays rock solid till date.The Fort offers one of the best views that you can get in Goa and for people who like bit of history this surely is a pilgrimage.
115,Heritage Place,"Taj Group has few properties in Goa. Attached to Beach & Red Fort this is exciting and fascinating property. Airy lobby, connected to all directions - restaurant, pool, beach gives you real feeling of Goa. Resort ambience makes it a perfect destination with facilities and beach. Room overlooking beach are interesting with basic facilities. Bathrooms are small and not Hotel type lavish. We got room at 4 pm since booking was done the same day but staff was apologetic. Food is tasty and has all the typical characteristics of Taj. Connectivity to beach makes it sought after venue."
116,An Architectural wonder,Fort is one the major attraction of North Goa and a must visit. this is perfect place for photo enthu people as it gives a breath taking view of sea.
117,Heritage fort,One of the most visited places in north goa. blend of nature and ancient architecture. Gives and awesome view.
118,Fort,The place has a nice history and is well kept alive still. Its a scenic place by the sea with lush greenery all over the fort. Great spot for clicking pics and i see many couples owe to each other in the back drop of the fort/beach. Pre wedding shoots and aspiring models definitely come over to click in this place.
119,Nothing much to see,"Staying at Taj Fort Aguada, we had the opportunity to visit the fort conveniently and spend some cosy moments while seeing the sunset. Unfortunately we also saw whole lot of trash in the sea. Disappoint. Wonder why people are so careless."
120,Heritage fort.,Interesting walk through the fort. Great lookout point and interesting architecture. Go in the morning to avoid the crowds and the heat
121,"Great spot, good views!",This place has history and this gives a beautiful vie of the sea. Slightly crowded but has good parking and nice road to reach there
122,oversold attraction,Good fort for a great view and gives you a chance to click some beautiful pictures. The only downside is that its too crowded and can get difficult to enjoy for a long time.
123,Very awesome place,The Aguada fort is most famous tourist attraction of Goa. The views of sea from the top are really awesome.
124,"Nothing much to see, nothing much to do",Amazing fort with breath taking views and neatly maintained.Must visit place.Its very close to Taj agauda
125,Visit to Fort Aguada,A lovely place... more so known for the picturesque locations shown in the Bollywood super hit movie Dil Chahta Hai!!! Lovely place with lovely views... a must visit place in Goa!!!
126,A remarkable fort in Goa,The place is quite historic. The jail and ten lighthouse are most highlights.Good to watch on mornings.its well maintained and nice place to view the beach
127,Fort aguada,"A landmark in Goa, this fort has been standing for centuries and draws huge crowds to watch the sunset from the ramparts of the fort projecting into the Arabian sea.  The stones are pitted with elements of nature. Sadly the water surrounding the fort has garbage floating all around, humans unmindful of protecting the environment.  A must visit for tourists."
128,One of the best forts in Goa,"You will get a beautiful sea view from this fort . Day time its very hot . it has a parking close by , and no need to walk or climb too much."
129,Not worth the travel,Not much to see to be honest but an old fort.  We were staying at the taj which Is next to it.  But in my opinion I wouldn’t make a big effort to go there
130,Fort view,The road that takes you up the hill to this Fort makes up for a wonderful drive. The fort complex isn't particularly huge but the views around are quite nice. the Fort walls also make up for a good background for your holiday pictures. There are a bunch of shops outside the complex which would serve you refreshing lemonade and hats of all kinds.But the really spectacular place is the waterfront that you reach if you go down to the Jail gate and then down through the bushes to the rocky waterfront. It makes up for some pretty breathtaking images.
131,Nothing Great!,This fort is a great reminiscent of Goa's past Portugeese glory. The fort is maintained in pretty decent condition (compared to Chapora fort). You can relax and spent a leisurely time here. You get to view the magnificent Arabian Sea from the top of this fort. There are no entry or parking fees.
132,Has a great history behind,Fort of Aguada is a small fort known to be built by colonials. The fort is beautiful and very near to the Arabian sea. The sea can be viewed from the fort. The visit to the fort is permitted only in the daytime. Snacks bar available near the fort.
133,Fort Aguada,Fort Aguada is a old fort in Goa. We can see the ocean from the fort also it appears in many films. A beautiful place.Maintenance work going for the fort..Ticket is RS 25 per personKids und myer 10 can go free..I feel that there should be a guide or a PowerPoint presentation which can tell the History of the fort. People interested can go for it.Also no books or booklets about the fort not available outside the for sale.
134,Best fort in Goa!,"Drove to this historic fort. Nice views overlooking sea. Worth a visit but wear sensible shoes. Health and safety isn’t at its best, so keep an eye on young children."
135,Good,"It is a picturesque fort, or what's remaining of it. Gets right into the sea and offers beautiful views of the waves crashing on to it. One can cover it well in under 2 hours, so could be clubbed with another place on the same day even if you are on a lazy holiday."
136,Needs Stamina,This is one of the much sort after tourist destination in goa which has a good old fort and a light house nearby. The fort is on a hill overlooking the Arabian sea and best place for a sunset.
137,Beautiful fort,"At least there is a bit of history here & the views down the beach are superb, all the way to Baga.But it's such a undeveloped place- at least the Government should clean it up considering that so many tourists visit this area. And the litter! Why does the Taj hotel not help? They have taken the most impressive part of it. Surely  they should put something back into the community?Watch out, the area is infested with snakes. Ask any local."
138,"Nice place for ""HISTORY LOVERS ""","During our vacay at Goa, we visited the still monumental Aguada Fort , its old architecture and history till today mesmerizes ! It a perfect location for some amazing photo shoots. Lovely view from the top and lil street shopping after the fort visit was a perfect site seeing experience"
139,Very Popular place,"If you are in the Sinquerim / Candolim area this fort is well worth a visit. From where the buses stop at Sinquerim, it's about a 2-3km (we walked, but there's quite a lot uphill).Entry to the fort is free of charge.It is a well preserved relic of the Portuguese era and there are some great views over the sea... Don't forget to take your camera."
140,Remnants of a fort,The fort is on hill and the car has to stop near parking so it require to climb and too much walk to enjoy the scenic beauty of Goa beaches.
141,A BEAUTIFUL spot to see the Arabian sea and sunset,It’s a very beautiful and must see place. You can spend a good 2-3 hours there. Read the history behind it and explore the fort. Amazing views from the fort towards the surrounding sea. Great for taking pictures. We went with young children. Also they had enjoyed a lot. Carry bottle of water if going in summer. It can get hot there.
142,Fort Aguada......a piece of Portuguese history,One of the well maintained forts in goa.. Crowded but very much worth a visit. Awesome views. Make sure to visit early or late evening as it can get hot in the noon.. Open till 5.
143,The Portuguese Fort at Aguada,"very close to Taj Properties in Candolim Goa. Nice and clean.Do not expect a very big fort , its of small size but good one"
144,go if you like history or view,"The fort has beautiful views. You can enjoy green environment at this place and is ideal place for photograhy. It also has good view of the sky, sea nad earth meeting at one point.This place however has opening and closing timings so please check timings before proceeding. Mornings would be a good time to visit as there was not much crowd. Also there are no taxis outside so plan your own transport to and fro as it is quite a distance to walk to."
145,good one,"Well.... this fort just next to the Taj group of properties was made famous by the Amir Khan-Saif Ali Khan movie Dil Chahta Hai! While we enjoy the Fort as a “Fort”, number of tourists find this as an attraction synonym with the movie. For many... it is mandatory to have a picture from the scene of the movie. A must visit for the first timers to the Fort."
146,Very standard fort ,Goa has the same red mud as they did centuries ago to build these forts...which structures are red and a good point for some nice photographs and  the feel of how this fort protected GOA from attacks....you can appreciate the work and layout and the materials used  to make the staircase... u have to be careful when u climb up them...and l can imagine how the soilders ran up and down them back in the days....   like all castles nowadays the mort is layed down with grass where as back in the days would have had water to stop people getting in the fort.....loved the visit here well worth it.....
147,Check it out ,"Since we were staying in Taj fort Agauda, made a lot of sense to visit the fort itself. We took the scenic path from bay view to sunset point. First thing first, it's huge. The entire walled fort is enormous. But has a serene charm. Inside the main fort and light house the atmosphere is serene, surrounded on three sides by sea , the view from all nooks and corner is breathtaking.The fort itself was built in late 16th century and has bits and pieces of Portuguese influence like Moats. It is a multi storeyed building with upper part that was used to provide water and other amenities to passing ships and lower level for banking Portuguese ships(which was then converted to jail).Must visit, for it fills you with wonder - however did they make such an imposing structure so beautifully."
148,Old Heritage  with spectacular view,It is has got great view of goa and can spend a good amount of 3 hours here. Try to visit in the morning before it get crowded and entry gates will be closed by 4 pm.
149,Worth to visit,Bad idea for a hot day... You enter into a plethora of selfie sticks and tourists crowding on top of each other.. Better idea would be to drive an additional 100 meters before final left to the fort for breathtaking sea views and no people
150,NICE,Beautiful and nicely maintained fort. Historically important.  Once visit is ok . Photogenic scenery.
151,Nice but not exciting,"Not much to see here, looks like a lighthouse. At $6 per foreigner, must be most expensive attraction in Goa.."
152,Visit if time allows,Fort build by portuguese to conserve water initially and then to protect themselves from enemy..nothing great about it..the amazing thing is the view u get it..perfect for a panoramic shot
153,FORT UPPER AGUADA,The best part of this place is there is no harassment and no entrance fee.  Toilets are clean and you are free to take pictures wherever you want.  Most this place is a must visit place and you can see vibrant crowd coming here.  We had a great time here yet again.
154,Beautiful Fort at River Front,"We drove to the fort instead of doing the 2km walk . Nice fort with lighthouse. There are restaurants close by to get refreshments. Views from top are spectacular. It’s open from 9 am to 6 pm everyday and there is no entrance fee. For a small fee can climb to the top of the lighthouse at the edge of the cliff and enjoy the experience and breathtaking views. The old light house is closed. We were staying at Taj Aguada which is built in the fort area. Nice walk out to the sea level fort walls, along the road past the Taj hotel. It’s open to the public and goes out in the sea."
155,Excellent ,The place is not exactly a fort. It's a old tank used to profile water to ships passing by. The only attraction in the fort is the old lighthous
156,FORT,One of the major attractions in Goa is this fort Aguada. The view from this fort is really nice. A nice place to get pictures clicked. There is lot of place for parking also. But not much time required here.
157,Fabulous location,"Quite famous tourist attraction of goa .a perfect view of sea and feels the coolest breeze. Sit on the edge of fort walls n rejuvenate yourself,well maintained and easily accessible"
158,Nice fort with beautiful view of mandovi river and arabian sea,This is a small fort (nothing great) can be visited in cloudy days but please avoid in sunny days its way too hot was in Feb. Overall place can be avoided
159,Not a great place to spend time,"A very interesting place. You can reach the fort tower either by walking up a slope or climbing the stairs, walking the narrow passage battlefronts (walkways), climbing down another slope. One stretch was very narrow- not more than 2 feet, at a height of atleast about 8-10 feet from ground; it is a little scary that there was no safety rails and with people trying to walk this stretch on either directions. But it was a very good experience.It has road on 3 sides and  water on one side. The lower part of the fort is a jail, and there is no entry. Better to visit the place early morning or later in the evening, as there is very little shade inside the Fort. Walking on the battlefronts/ walkways on the 3 sides is an experience and one should try it, even though it was a little scary.I missed the Sinquerim Fort, but i think it would be a good idea to visit that fort along with this one as well."
160,Beautiful Fort,"A historic monument offering a nice view of the sea, especially at sunset. Nevertheless, I don’t think it’s worth the foreigner price, 12x higher than normal. Not much to see there, 15mins is more than enough. It’s better to spend the money on a boat cruise nearby."
161,Historical tourist attraction and free of entry,Drove about 10kms from the Baga beach on bikes and spend about 1hr at the Fort. It was fun... took lot of pictures all around. Apart that not much to do... so visit only if you have some free time at hand.
162,A must place to visit in North Goa,A well known tourist place. Fort Aguada built with red stone which lasts against sea water. Built by Portuguese for protection against Dutch and others. A fresh water spring in the fort provided fresh water to ship sailing to the port. A very thick red stone wall with deep ditch which was fiiled up full with water to protect against enemies. Space for cannon & gun shooting kept. A scenic view of Arabian Sea and Panji city.
163,Historical and Free,Good sight seeing location with good sea view. Visit this place in the morning to avoid huge crowd. Preferably go in the morning to beat the heat
164,Portuguese Citadel,"Very nice and broad vjew of sea, river and greenary. Scenery is cool, ideal for selfies :). Way from Condolim to fort is also awesome."
165,Monument for family crowd,The fort is from the Portuguese era. The premises are clean and tidy. Not too many steps to climb. The view out into the sea is beautiful.
166,A good place to be at! ,"An fort built by the Portuguese,  there is a light house which is interesting as well.  Can spend 2 hours here"
167,Horrible and old.. not worth the money,I went during the odd hours and was exhausted. There's no shade and is definitely not a place to go when it's hot. The ideal time to visit should be before 12. I happened to reach there around 11:30 anyways. They charge you lots for parking and food/snack outside the fort.
168,Photography,Visit this place for the view a picture of you with you buddies.You might consider wearing a shoe its a little uneven road.
169,Good fort ,A fort that gets very crowded. Main attraction is India’s highest lighthouse and some spectacular views from the battlements. Worth a visit if you happen to be nearby.
170,aquada fort,Nothing much to offer maybe thats why no entry fee. Visit in evening to enjoy sunset views. Sun plays a spoilsport in the afternoon. Can easily pass an hour here in photography/selfies.
171,awesome views,A lot of photo actionsandy beachgreat at sunsetFort part of history of the Portuguese Colony in GoaA lot of beach shacks for a quick snack
172,Nice views,Fort doesn't have much specialities than the other forrs I visited. But the history behind it tells a lot about the Portuguese in14th century.. must visit place if you are in Goa..
173,"Fort Visit ""BecomeSolo Traveller ",After crossing Sinquerim area one can drive towards to the ridge.One can witness the old portuguse Era & clock tower .Different cells & light house was there for protection pupose in the middle of the sea.View is scenic from here as entire sea stretch can be visbile.
174,Too many tourists and poorly maintained ,The area of the fort is very small. We had to purchase Rs 25/- ticket each. The fort has a light house and it was made by the portuguese.
175,One time visit ,"Had gone to Goa a couple months back and it being my first visit to the state had hired a cab/tour guide to tour whatever places there were for attractions. The guide chauffeured us to Aguada Fort in North Goa. Despite it being the early days of the season the crowd was a lot more than a handful.From the entrance the walled structure seemed decent holding inside possibly anything. The circumfrencing lawns sprawling into maybe a few acres couldn't do much to hold up the facade. Upon nearing the fort gates the curiosity peaked. But, that is where the facade loses its grip and what crawls is disappointment. The fort is nothing but a seaside bunker for the old Portuguese army. It houses the barracks underground with an entrance erected in the middle of the compound.Has decent view atop its walls and if missed won't be a problem."
176,Visit if its your first Goa trip,"Fort Aguada has a number of things to see in and around. So read up about the place(s) and plan your trip or else you will return seeing a large building made of stones. Also, if you are on a summer trip, make sure your visit is in the early morning, for the heat in the peak of summer is not something you will look forward to. Carry water.On the other hand, you can plan a late afternoon trip, watch a mind-boggling sunset and come back happy."
177,Once ,Good place and also old one. Very Crowded always throughout the day. It takes 15 to 20 min to see the entire fort.
178,Not mandatory ,"There's nothing wrong with the place - it just is what it is: a big fort. It was a very hot day and there were loads of people walking around. I would have stayed a bit longer if there was more shade. Perhaps they could turn the square in the middle of the court into a canopied display area with some more information and artefacts.Otherwise, it's interesting just to walk along the battlements as there's a nice sea view and - if you're lucky - a bit of a breeze.If you're travelling with children, or you're not too steady on your feet, go with caution. There's not much in the way of safety barriers, and one part of the battlements is extremely narrow, with two-way passing traffic and a long drop."
179,Great views and excellent architecture,Its an old beautiful architecture of brown stones. The view from the fort is worth visiting place. There is an old jail and light house also.
180,Nice Views,There is many fort in goa.. But agauda is main fort for tourist it have jail time of Portuguese. U can see light house too.. At entrance many shops are there to buy stuffs. Overall nice place
181,Portuguese Architecture at it's best,A very historic fort... with lighthouse... easily accessible and  navigateable. Great vistas in all directions
182,“Great view from the Top “,"Some of the people writing reviews of Fort Aguada must have the wrong place, possibly the smaller Fort Sinquerim next to Sinquerim beach.  Fort Aguada is very big and quite impressive.  The vast majority of the original fort is there and is quite impressive.We enjoyed walking around the walls and marvelling at the large moat.  it would be absolutely brilliant if more of the inside of the fort was accessible. We found that only the gate house could be entered.  The main tower and the water storage for which the fort is named were both closed to the public. Although much of the attraction is off limits, this is not surprising since there is no entrance fee, you just walk in.  Despite this, there is a public toilet facility.In many ways, I wish that whoever owns the fort would charge a modest fee and fully open the place up.  I am sure that the internal part of the fort would be well worth it."
183,Enjoyable spot.. Mark of Portuguese establishment in India,We visited this fort just before sunset and found it too much overcrowded. Even the part of the fort offering a good sea view was lined with people and there was almost a queue at some good points to take pics. Just a piece of advice...if you are visiting Goa on a peak season avoid this fort as you will not enjoy it at all. Only visit this if you are in Goa in off season.
184,Its always nice to be here !!,One can visit aguada fort during monsoons also. The view is mesmerizing. Though there is nothing much to do but can visit it to have good pictures and enjoy cool breeze along the beach.
185,Sands of Time !!!,"It is one of the best fort in Goa and shows the influence of Portuguese architecture. This is must visit place in Goa. Visitors can experience the beautiful road, which leads to the fort."
186,The majestic fort Aguada,We went in July during the monsoons and the black dark horizons against the beautiful ocean and the dark fort made for quite a view. Personally it’s one of the best places to visit in Goa esp in monsoons. I loved it. Hire a scooty for the day and let it take you places. Perfect for a family getaway .
187,Must visit,"Well preserved fort and Light house. Good for an evening visit. Better to have own transport. Road to the fort runs along the river bank, and is wonderful for photography."
188,A well preserved Portugese fort in the lap of sea,This is one of the must see attractions in Goa. It’s built by Portuguese during 17th century and is in great condition even now. You may have to walk a bit to see the complete fort and you will get a magnificent view of Arabian Sea from the fort.
189,Light House Near The Beach,"The fort is actually just a big water tank with a lighthouse attached. Nothing ""architectural"" about it. The view of the river and sea is good but that's a very small positive and definitely not worth a long drive especially if you're staying in south goa."
190,Nice view point!!,"The place is nice, but i saw nothing special at this place. Visit only if you’re anywhere nearby this location otherwise you might feel that you’ve wasted your time. But the place is clean and nicely maintained."
191,A Must Visit Place,This fort was built by Portuguese to protect their region from the Dutch. It has a great view of the sea and ample parking.
192,Must visit in Goa,Has history seeped into it. Was a good enjoyable day trip. Served a good reminder of Goan history and the tryst with Portuguese
193,Hues of nature!,"Fort Aguada is a nice place to visit if you are in Sinquerim. The views of the sea are nice, and the place is relatively easy to access from the beach. Do enjoy the Fort and the beach when in Sinquerim."
194,Old nice fort,"The Fort is not under any regular maintenance though they are charging ₹25/- from Indian and ₹300/- (exorbitant one) from foreigners and no guide. Approaching road is also in very bad conditions. Temperature was very hot in December. Parking charges ₹50/-. No arrangements for drinking water/bathroom by the authority. Outside shops selling ""lembupani"" @ ₹30/- for a small glass. Right corner of the fort was closed due to damages. Authority should wake up and develop the infrastructure, facilities like toilet /bathroom a must. Not at all in good condition, overall condition very negative except VIEW from top as it's free of maintenance."
195,fort Aguada,"This is one of the must see attractions in Goa, popular for its lighthouse which is so antique. It is built by Portuguese during 17th century and is in great condition even now. You may have to walk a bit to see the complete fort, but you will get a magnificent view of Arabian Sea from the fort. You will certainly appreciate the structure and wonderful view of the sea from the fort. If you are on a summer trip, make sure your visit is in the early morning, for the heat in the peak of summer is not something you will look forward to. Carry water along.On the other hand, you can plan a late afternoon trip, watch a mind-boggling sunset and come back happy."
196,Nice place for super view,"it is a isolated, deserted, broken fort... there is nothing much to see except very old broken walls.the entrance of the fort is surrounded by road side hawkers, shops and juice outlets.most of the shop owners are very rude and they have no manners as how to speak to people, tourists.if you want to see any of their items hanging in their shops, they refuse to give to you just to check and then if you do not buy from them , they kind of bully you.Liquor, beer are supposed to be very cheap there but now this is not the case anymore..... all shop owners, restaurants are robbing tourists there and charge double, triple than the MRP of the bottles..i had to buy one beer bottle for Rs. 180 with MRP written on it as just Rs. 85.there is no standard, fixed price for anything... locals charge tourists seeing his paying ability...advice for tourists.... always, always bargain... or look for other options"
197,Must visit Places,Fort Aguada is a must place to visit when in North Goa. The road that leads to the fort is beautiful. It is open on all days from 8:30am to 5:30pm and there is no entry fee. The fort is built in the 17th century Portuguese style. The view facing the Arabian sea is serene.
198,Awesome Place,"Located near Sinquerim Beach where the Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea confluence is Fort Aguada on a hillock by the same name. From the Sinquerim Beach, Fort Aguada is an hour's walk across breath-taking views of the Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea. It is a must visit for any visitor to Goa."
199,Fort Aguada,"Fort Aguada is a nice fortification near the Aguada area (where Taj hotel was). We just landed here as we wanted a bike ride up the hill and near the jail area.The fort itself is decent with nice views of the sea. But it is too touristy and crowded which can mar the atmosphere. Plus we visited on a hot day and there was very little shade, so we just came back pretty quick."
200,Worth a visit- free and great views,"Crowded place, not a place to be at during hot and long public holiday,  lot crowded during holiday nothing interesting to say about this place, drive to this place is good. Parking can be a pain"
201,Great place- must visit ! ,It is must see place in Goa .i visited with my friends ND enjoyed alot .we took rent  open top jeep. For 2days we joyed too much
202,Beautiful and calm place,Just a boundary wall with ARABIAN SEA in Background ....and a Lighthouse in Centre...No Ticket to Visit...Free Parking.
203,"Beautiful Arabian views, nice place to watch the sunset!",Fort aguda is located on a slight hill top near to candolim beach which was constructed by the Portuguese which has a light house also inside it. It been used for navigation for the ships. It's a nice location for the photographs with the red-stone construction. The sea view from the fort is exceptional.
204,Romantic spot,Fort Aguada is one of the prominent tourist attractions in Goa. It’s a very old Fort with a nice  Lighthouse. The view from this fort is mesmerising. Overlooking to the sea one can’t ask for anything better. We went in the morning and was quite hot guess it would be ideal to go in the evening. Go visit this place and experience it. Not worth missing it out from your Goa itinerary
205,Fort aguada,Try to shell out some time from beach and visit this beautiful ruins of fort. Its very scenic at sun set time (not later than 5~5.30 PM)
206,Average Place,"A great must visit place, if you want to gain a perspective of the history of Goa. Especially how centuries back, the rulers invented means and methods to use Forts as the first defence AND as the last defence. The fort is open to all public, from 0830 am to 1730 pm. With adequate parking close to the location, it is very much accessible. You get a view of the sea, and how the vertical walls of the fort, with a defined slope, deterred any attempts of marauders. It is a real picnic spot, if you bring the food with you."
207,Average,Has great history and places that are open is well managed. But there is lot of parts of the monument closed from public access.Very sad to see 99.99% of people coming there for their selfies in social sites and no interest in history.
208,One of the must visit locations in Goa,"As title said , its not a great place to spend time in there. But definitely a place to visit with friends if you are visiting goa 1st time ( from the excitement of ""Dil chahta hai"" movie )But it has a good view to the sea, might be good in the early morning ( but the fort opens most after 9AM) so yeah best to watch around 9 am as it might be less crowded )"
209,Good place to visit once,the sunset from the fort is breathtaking. the 180 degrees view of the sea is unobstructed and cool breeze blowing on your face makes the visit worthwhile. walk across to the farthest point for some superb pictures.
210,GOA FAMILY TRIP,It was a grand old fort in its time with the capacity to hold 79 cannons among other weapons of defense.
211,Superb view !!!,Fort is good you must Visit in evening to enjoy sunset views. Sun plays a spoilsport in the afternoon. Can easily pass an hour here in photography
212,Protected Historical Fort ,"This is one of the most popular places in Goa. Parking is a huge hassle so park much before u enter the narrow lane that takes you to the fort.It just on the edge of Candolim beach and a great spot for the view of the beaches, boats and skies. U can hang around here for a long time Nd just enjoy the breeze. Reach here by 5 so that u can spend 2 hours at least."
213,Huge Open space fort,Fort Aguada is a well maintained fort in Goa. A must visit place for photo op.The fort offers a stunning view of Arabian sea. We will also recommend a visit to the nearby lighthouse for a panoramic view of the fort.
214,Serene place with an amazing view,Entry to the fort is free and takes approximately 1 hour to go round and learn some of the Portuguese history and influence in Goa. Good place for photos and is a welcome break from the beaches. Wouldn’t say it was a life changing must see but worth an hour of your holiday time. Great in the fact that it hasn’t been exploited to death with a gift shop at the end.
215,Fort,"Nevertheless This is known for the beaches and the party culture, but this is one historical monument dedicatedly worth a visit. Overlooking the Arabian Sea, the fort and the adjacent jail carries you back in time.One advice- try avoiding it on a hot sunny day."
216,Good views of Sea,Fort Aguada is a Heritage fort of goa.it is one of scenic location in Goa.many films shotted here last 5year.here is one light house which is operated amazingly last 300 year till date.near by fort spotted Dolphin also.it is Portuguese fort and use to surveillance for foreign enemy attack on Goa.
217,Worthy Visit,"Fort Aguada is a historic and well maintained fort. Its also called as ""Dil Chahta Hai"" fort since a few scenes of the movie was shot here. This is on the banks of river Mandovi and the view from the top is amazing. This fort will be crowded most of the times."
218,Very neatly maintained place with good views,Worth while to visit. The fort is well preserved and the great summary of the history on notice boards enables you to visit the fort without a guide. I would recommend a visit to this site.
219,Must See Fort of Goa,"Was an Awesome experience,Came back all refreshed and rejuvenated,Staff was really so hospitable ,Helpful,and felt like a Hugh family!"
220,The view!,Its some far from the city area and entry fee is 25 Rs. P.p and one light house is also there and sea area also looks good from that height
221,Time your visit right,"The fort on the hillock is the Aguada fort with the freshwater spring. It has excellent views far into the ocean and inland. There is a moat , cut into the stone in some places.The larger part of the fort is the part below on sinquerim beach. That section has been given over to the TATA Group and they have built a hotel named  ""Taj Fort Aguada Resort & Spa"" on it. Therefore its not accessible anymore and the hotel construction would have destroyed most of the archaeological evidence on the site. (see attached photos)The fort also has a massive moat at this lower level but its been allowed to crumble away. A small hotel has been allowed to build a massive concrete bridge across it damaging the walls of the moat (see photo)"
222,A Happy Family outing,A good tip is to climb the lighthouse for a fantastic view of the fort rather than pay 300 rupees to get into the fort when Indians pay 25 rupees. The lighthouse only cost 25 rupees. There is not a lot to see when you get into the fort but there is a lot of information.
223,Historical Heritage Visit,"You will certainly appreciate the structure and wonderful view of the sea from the fort. Plan your visit well,preferably before Sunset. Usually a crowded place..."
224,Sea view,This fort was constructed by Portuguese people  for defending against enemy attacks. It was also used as a watering point for their ships hence the name Aguada. It was also used as a jail to house freedon fighters. It is a marvelous monument . Entrance is free. The views from the fort is excellent. a must visit for anyone visiting Goa.
225,you have cool beaches and these lovely historcal forts,"One of best sight seeing of north goa. Easy to access by road, this historic property is well maintained by the government."
226,breathtaking,"It's hardly a fort. Only one wall running the entire length. It was very crowded but there was nothing much to see, so quite anti-climactic. One might capture some good photographs from first floor, but if  you visit at the right time  and the crowd is less. The house adjacent to it is also ill-maintained and entry not allowed. Or may be that was so when we visited."
227,Fort Aguada,"A fort on banks of river, still in good condition, most of the fort is closed for maintaince or by govt rules ,fine to watch sunrise and sunset from here, cool place , photogenic place. but you can spend just 1- to 2 hrs at the most. parking is expensive for 4 wheeleers @m 100 rs .  built in red stone still manages to show the craft and enggineering skills of the portges, a one time visit when ur in goa ."
228,great views but little else,This is one of the best preserved forts in Goa with a huge lighthouse. It was one of the strongest forts under the portuguese and was strategically constructed to get a very good birds eye view of the Arabian sea. Entry is free and schedule at least 1 to 1.5 hour to see this place.
229,place with historical background,"A wonderful remembrance of Portugese architecture, articulate planning and military efforts. The legacy of Portugese colonisation is very visible here. Great view of the sea....Fort is not well maintained.....Lighthouse did not seem accessible to public...Food/snack outside the fort is very expensive......."
230,Good considering it is free,Very busy and felt unhappy at being charged 300 Rps for being foreign when everyone else was charged 25Rps - definitely won’t be visiting again and it definitely wasn’t worth the 300 RP entrance fee each !!! Rip off
231,Historical visit ,"An old fort, only good for photo shooting.Entry fee Rs 75 for Indian.Nearby parking available.Wide and nice view of arabian sea from here."
232,Dil Chahta Hai was filmed here,This is a ok fort. only walls are remaining and a lighthouse which is still functional. View of sea is good.
233,Good Fort,Its a well maintained fort..though it does not offer much to see or do.Should be your last option whenever visiting Goa.
234,Overrated & Over crowded,Fort Aguada is a picturesque fort along with a light house; built in 1612. It is situated on Sinquerim beach in Goa. You get an amazing soothing view of the sea. The history behind this fort is very intresting; as the word “Aguada” means “watering place”- it was built by Portugese rulers; this fort was used to supply fresh water to the passing by ships. The parking fee is expensive (we paid 100rs). And there are some small food stalls outside the fort as well. I liked this place and you can definitely spend some time with your friends here.
235,Nice and decently preserved,Nice place. Should visit early morning to avoid scorching heat. The visiting hours are from 8:30 in the morning till 5:30 in the evening. Decent place. As I said one time visit is enough.
236,Pleasant place to visit,"Well worth wondering around & driving all the way round to see the old Prison  & Jimmy Gaspar's house- it has the best location in Goa, I think.Watch out for the guys with machine guns though."
237,The view,The fort was constructed  to guard against the Dutch and the Marathas. Light house inside the fort was a reference point for the vessels coming from Europe at that time. It is of made red stone.Ship use to fill fresh water from this fort . This fort is on the shore of River Mandvi . Beautiful view of the blue water is mesmerizing  along with cool breeze of the river . Entry fee is 25 INR for indians and 300 INR for foreigner. 30 kilometer from Panaji and hardly few minutes drive from sinquerium beach .  Parking facility is available .
238,A very good view of the sea,"Fort gets very crowded and in jan the temp was 32degrees, when this heat get mixed with humidity, stones and crowd, it becomes really bad. It has a lighthouse in the middle and some spectacular views from the battlements. Lot of good restraunt on the way. Worth a visit if you are staying nearby."
239,Beautiful remains of a fort on the sea,Views are nice. Good location for photography. It could be hot in afternoon so try to reach early. Carry water.
240,Good views,Fort is clean but too simple and plain with free entry. It has Sinquerim at the base of hill which is a kilometer far. Nothing much to look around. Reis Magos fort is much better.
241,Fort,"Beautiful fort built by Portuguese near the shores of Arabian Sea where Mandovi river joins the sea. The fort is still in good condition with a moat surrounding it. There used to be a light house inside the fort that is abandoned now and a new light house is built near the fort. Also, in the middle of the fort, there is a huge rectangular tank used to store water. A must place to visit in North Goa. Entrance fee is very nominal for Indian visitors."
242,Splashing Taj charm ,One of the oldest fort built by the Portuguese along the cliffs side. One of the major tourist attractions and no entry tickets. Bit crowded almost all the time. Beautiful spots to get your pics get clicked good.Tips: Visits during day/noon time during bright sun are only recommended with proper protections and sunscreen
243,Historical value,"The better option for Aguada fort is Chapora Fort, Aguada is situated at a distanced place. Overcrowded and nothing to watch for except the lighthouse."
244,Over rated and crowded,Not exactly a fort. Was earlier used a water harvesting and reservoir for water supply. Nice view of the water body below from top of the fort. The fort is visible while taking boat ride at Coco beach. Parking available. Nice lemon soda is also available at the parking site.
245,Marisco,"Goa has its own charm! We all know that, but Fort Aguada is a must for the first timers! The way itself makes you wall in love, specially when you are on your Activa! The red stone is common in Goa and so as in Fort Aguada which was a Jail Once upon a time! The light house is again symbolic! The vicinity has a perfect high raised view of the Arabian Sea on one side and a beautiful fort on its shore. Best time is of course on a cloudy day, the strong wind is a common feature."
246,A piece of history!!!,Took taxi from Candolim up to the fort on a. Sunday afternoon. The fort closes at 17:30.  The fort is huge and you can walk all around the wall which has seek nice views out to sea. Very busy with locals at the time of our visit. No fee to look around.
247,"Can avoid, it is just a hype",The impact of excessive visiters is clearly being seen. Beer bottles were thrown all around and the beach below the fort was dirty.
248,Great outlook,"This old fort was constructed by the Portuguese in the 17th century in North Goa to guard from the Dutch and the Marathas. A fresh water spring within the fort used to provide fresh water to the ships that used to stop by it. The upper part of the fort is surrounded by a moat. A four storey light house stands on the upper deck of the fort, climbing on which is not permitted. There is no entry fee to the fort."
249,"Great views, very nice fort",Aguada fort is great construction build by Portuguese.aguada fort is so good and popular for its lighthouse which is so old .Please visit fort in morning or evening because of heavy sunlight in summer.view  from fort is great.
250,"Beautiful views, nice place to watch the sunset!",Not a very good place to visit. No proper public transport. Need to travel by taxi.Better to visit if you have own vehicle.I recommend this place to family but going with friends is not worth.
251,Nothing much to do and see,"This is an average property to visit. Overcrowded and busy place, opens from 8:30 morning to 5:30 evening only."
252,Amazing location in Goa to get a great historical view,"The fort was constructed in 1612 to guard against the Dutch and the Maraths It was a reference point for the vessels coming from European Countries at that time. This old Portuguese fort stands on the beach south of Candolim, at the shore of the Mandovi It was initially tasked with defense of shipping and the nearby Bardez sub district.This is the Perfect Example of Fascinating Views all around One Side Lush green trees and Grass & Other side Arbean Sea View You Enjoy Your whole day if time permits you.  Old time this place was a #Jail and also the Light House made for Keeping eyes on Enemies this is one the best Historical place to visit I in North Goa Special Booked Buses,  Cabs,  bike are easily accessible to the place.Cheapest will be 🚌Bus as you can contact any Travel Agent near to your area who can arrange your Whole day sight seeing. It can cover some beautiful beaches and other fascinating places too."
253,Extremely boring and over rated,The fort itself is small. You can get some nice views of the bay. Don't forget to take the detour to touch the old central jail. there is small place to the side where the waves hit the rocks. You can spend some time just enjoying the spray.
254,Beautiful Fort,aguada fort..massive structure..marvellous view.. well maintained..but too much hipe..to be true..from the word 'fort'..had expected a royal and strong structure..though expecting a 'royal' and 'layered' building under thr name 'fort' is a cliché..but was expecting something more of the place..but DO VISIT..SOMETHING DIFFERENT THEN NORMAL TOURIST SITES..
255,Nothing much to see in this fort,"It was built in 1612 by Portugese. It's situated on Sinquerim beach in Goa. Aguada is a Potugese word which mean ""watering place"". I felt very lucky to be a witness of this historic creation. I would suggest everyone to pay a visit in afternoon. It's a beautiful fort."
256,A Nice Fort overlooking the Arabian Sea,Fort Aguada is some miles away from the candolim beach .You can rent a bike and can easily ride by your own .The view from the top of this place is literally incredible.Click pictures there is you love clicking one .No tickets are there to enter .Recommended for the view lovers .
257,Selfie opportunity ,"Fort Aguada has withstood the rigors of time and nature and is in pretty good shape.  However, it doesn't have much to see besides a great view and the fort walls.  The forts in San Juan, Puerto Rico and St. Augustine, Florida probably have more to see so I would rank Fort Aguada below them.  Still, it's easy to get to with a taxi and doesn't require a lot of time to see the whole thing.  I would probably recommend going towards the end of the day to watch the sun set."
258,Must Visit,"Average place not much to see but on the hill so give nice view avoide sunny day or have water bottle with you ,few spots for nice photographer...other than this nothing special ..."
259,A fort with an undefinable Feel! ,"On 23rd Dec'2019, myself with my hubby got to visit Fort Aguada during our year end vacation to Goa.Fort Aguada is one of the most popular tourist destinations of Goa, it is excellent for sightseeing and also stands as a testimony to the glory of Portuguese empire.The location where the fort was constructed was of strategic importance to the empire and provides a great defense base.Aguada Light house & Aguada Jail were also available inside. Spent a wonderful evening at Fort Aguada."
260,Great and good place,"Visit in Early morning, check for opening hours. In afternoon, the place is hot and no place to shelter.Basically fort hasn't much interesting things to view. It provides amazing sea view from top of fort. Fort contain just square walls. There is path way on walls, so you can walk around enjoy views.No, it's not the fort seen in ""Dil Chahta Hai"""
261,Place to avoid on sunny days,"Hospitality 100%.food excellent with healthy options.spread large and wide variety. Fresh juices,corn and cereals,cheese varieties,cut fresh fruits,infused water,cannot list out. One has to be there to experience it all. View priceless."
262,good to visit once,Approach road to the fort in bad condition. ASI collects Rs 25 from domestic tourists as entry fee. You need to climb a narrow strip along the wall to get the wonderful view of the sea and Panjim city.
263,Small fort,"There is a lighthouse, taking a scooter is the best mode of transport, road is good but very narrowtraffic jams happenThere is no entry ticketyou just walk around and youll see spectacular views from the side wallswell maintained"
264,What a beauty,"Probably worth an hour or so of your holiday, not much more. Just the walls remain; little,if any, artifacts."
265,Good place for 1st timer,Aguada situated in Southern portion of Mapusa District of North Goa. Worth going if you are found of photography as the view of the fort and the beach close by is simply amazing. Its a windy place so no issues if the sun is on the head as the wind keep the temprature really cool.It is a small fort compared to other forts but is really nice if you want to have some exquisite pictures of the fort and the beach which is seen from the wall of the fort.There is a entry fees of Rs. 25 for a adult and no fees for child beween 1-12 yrs.
266,Ok but not amazing,"Due to lack of tourist sightseeing places in goa, such forts are popular with first-timers, but its decent enough if you have time with you and got nothing else to do, the fort is just old remains of some historical fort, the scenic view from the fort is nice and there is a small bunch of shopping places outside the fort.The entry is free and there is nothing called maintenance here."
267,A Massive Fortification!,The journey towards the fort may not be lively and clean. The roads are narrow and it is advisable to tour the fort during the day. There is no entry fee and you need to walk around and climb a few steps. Senior citizens may not enjoy it. The sea view is very good and you could see the ships/boats sailing.Overall a good trip and it worth a visit.
268,Fascinating 17th century fortification,it's nice place if temperature is low and want to enjoy good view from top . otherwise for history buff only structure is there .
269,Good place to spend some free time,"You need to wear comfortable shoes as the walk to the fort is not a smooth one. Except for the fact that it has a good view, there is nothing much to it. Not much information about its historical importance has been given. I believe the main attraction for tourist to visit here is because a lot of movies have been shot here. If you are on a short visit in Goa, you can give it a miss."
270,Nothing Special...visit if have Leisure time.,"Visited in May, drawback-it was hot,generally crowded Plus-nice little fort to visit, scenic backdrop, good selfie points"
271,Beautiful small Fort,An Amazing view of GOA’s most spectacular Beach. This comprises : Sinquerim - CANDOLIM - Calangute - BAGA.
272,Bored in the Barracks,"Fort Aguada is one of the few places nit encroached by rampant building activity. Set along a beautiful setting overlooking the waterfront. A wonderful remnant of Portugese architecture and military efforts. The ASI does a great job of keeping the structure intact for future generations to see the legacy of Portugese colonisation.I think the true character of the fort comes alive in the rains. So if you are around Candolim, it would be a shame to miss out on it."
273,"Crowded Fort, next to sea, in middle of greenery","A great place to check out the sunset and spend some time. Go down to the Sinquerim beach if you're looking for a clean, uncrowded stretch of sand!"
274,Hot and Rocky,This fort truly exhibits the master piece of engineering & construction dating way back to 17th century. It has lot of open space with breathtaking view of ocean. A must visit place in Goa.
275,Nothing Special,"First of all because of some local contracts, two wheeler parking is raised to rs. 50. Next, there are tickets to visit this place but there is huge queue, it seems somebody is not able to sell tickets at right pace."
276,A little bit of history and culture to break up the hot beaches ,"This fort was built on the mouth of the River Mandovi by the Portuguese in the seventeenth century. The huge walls and the still robust construction is a testimony to the brilliant architecture of those times. You need to walk a lot, specially near the light house. You need to climb steep stairs to reach the top of the fort to get the excellent view. Not recommended for old people. The lighthouse climbing is now banned. Also the entrance is quite rocky and I had sprained my ankle there"
277,A Bare Historical Site,Fort Aguada situated in Southern portion of Mapusa District of North Goa. It is a very small Fort used to cater Fresh Water to the Portuguese Ships in the past. The place is easily accessible by road. A very little walk and a few steps and you're there. The place is unique but not quite like a fort. May add this place in your list of places in your North Goa trip to visit. Very nice scenes of Mandovi River can be seen from the top. There is a lighthouse there. Presently the place is under renovation.
278,worth visit,Fort Aguada is one of the most popular tourist destinations of Goa. It receives a lot of tourist traffic all around the year. Reasons are that it’s excellent for sightseeing and also that it stands as a testimony to the glory of Portuguese empire.
279,Not Good!,"Fort Aguada lies on Sinquerim Beach, south of the popular Candolim beach in the lively north Goa. Checked with local what does Aguada mean and came to an interesting trivia - Aguada in Portuguese means watering place. There is a freshwater spring inside the fort that imparts its name to the fort. (interesting!)The fort stands tall and depicts Portuguese architectural. Once can truly spend hours looking at vast Arabian Sea from the top. Lighthouse looks great and truly this place attracts lot of tourists (photo bombing all over :D) . Worth visit this place."
280,Visit,"Fort Aguada is approx 6 km by road from Candolim Beach and 3km from Sinquerim Beach. There are transport options of tuk tuk or taxi, but we chose to walk. This is a little unsafe due to no paths, erratic driving and warm weather. It is a wonderful location and well worth the visit. There are also constant tourist bus trips to the fort, so a continuous parade of visitors. Take a hat.You can also take a boat trip and go out through the river to get a fantastic view from the water for 300 rupees. The ocean is also a great way to cool down. The beaches have life guards all the way along and due to the lack of people capable of swimming strongly and undertow, there is a reluctance to allow swimmers in further than their thighs."
281,"A historic, well maintained, lovely Fort","A little away from Calangute (roughly a few miles)lies the majestic fort Aguada.it is a timeless monument in Goan history and is  worth seeing.it has a tower which houses a magnificent lighthouse which truly caught my imagination.built by the Portuguese four centuries ago ,this monument has huge walls,stairways,a cell situated below that housed prisoners back in time.Its has a calm and peaceful atmosphere around it.overlooking the Arabian Sea and the mighty waves hitting the shores make an unforgettable experience.try bringing a raincoat along as well.a waterproof bag for your camera as you will need it undoubtedly if it pours.can easily spend 2 hours here admiring the fort or simply enjoying its calmness or simply taking pics.no entry fee as I remember.carry your own water bottle.no parking fee either."
282,love history,The place has great views of the sea and coast around - but apart from the walls with moat and the tower within the fort there is not much to see. There is some amount of history but unless you read up about it you would never know what this place was all about. Go for a quick half hour visit to see the views - can get crowded as lots of tourists are brought here as a mandatory stop.
283,Tick-in-the-box,Bad service.. old rooms small bathrooms old furniture and fittings.. needs an upgrade.. at least stop charging so much and calling yourself a 5 star absolutely no go
284,Overcrowded Fort,Aguada fort doesn't have the size of Golconda or Chitradurga fort. Nor does it have the beauty of Bekal fort that is near the sea. All you see is a large courtyard within the wall with full of people who are more interested in taking pictures and selfies rather than the architecture of history. Quite crowded.Reis Magos fort is any day a better Choice.
285,Famous light house,"Fort Aguada Is located on the shore of Mandovi River Near Sinquerim Beach. There is not entry fee. Its 1606 CE fort made by Portuguese. Aguada means watering the place. This fort has Light house and very big walls. The fort was constructed to guard against the Dutch and the Marathas. So It was initially tasked with defense of shipping and the nearby Bardez sub district.The fort is so large that it envelops the entire peninsula at the south western tip of Bardez. I will recommend to visit at the time of Sunset for beautiful view because in the day time its very hot. Outside the fort there are not much shop you will only find juice, ice cream and lemon juice shops. There is ample amount of parking where cars can be drove till the end."
286,Old Magnificent Fort,The most popular spotVery crowdedMonument with historyMonument with viewFamily and friends fun Good with groups
287,Dil Chahta Hai Fort!,"Time to spend : 1-2 hrs depending on interest in Photography.Best time to Visit: Anything except May, Hot-Humid seasons. What to see?  Fortification, Lighthouse, Moat, Water and Food : No water & food on the Fort.  But there are stalls at the base of the fort.Stay / Accommodation : No place to stay on the Fort.Guide Facility : NoParking Facility : At the base of Fort.Entry Fee : NilThis is the largest and the best-preserved Portuguese bastion in Goa and was built in 1609-12, to control the entry into the river Mandovi and to protect Old Goa from potential enemy attacks.A freshwater spring - from where the fort derives it's name - within the fort provided water supply to the ships that called there. Ringed by thick battlements, the heart of the fort was protected by two hundred cannons and a deep dry moat, which one still has to cross to get inside.Strategically located at the estuary of the river Mandovi, this fort was constructed in 1612 as a guard against invasions from the Dutch and the Marathas. The walls of this fort are 5 metres high and 1.3 metres wide. Little surprise then that this remains to be the only fort that was not conquered by any invaders during the 450 yearlong rule of the Portuguese empire.The area around the fort housed a large well and a number of springs that provided fresh drinking water to the voyagers that arrived by ship. ""Agua"" in Portuguese means water, thus the fort derived its name ""Aguada"" to denote a place where water is accumulated.Steps lead down from the middle of the courtyard within to an enormous vaulted cistern capable of storing ten million litres of fresh water. The other unusual feature of the fort is a four-storey Portuguese lighthouse, erected in 1864 and the oldest of its kind in Asia.An interesting feature in the precinct of the fort is a 13 metre high lighthouse. This lighthouse, built in 1864, initially used an oil lamp. It was later renovated and modernised in 1976.This lighthouse was home to a gigantic bell that was retrieved from amongst the ruins of the St. Augustus monastery at Old Goa. However, the bell has now been moved to the Our Lady of Immaculate Conception church at Panaji.Though the entire fort is no longer intact, some buildings that are still in good shape have been converted into a prison. Interestingly, it happens to be the largest prison in Goa"
288,Bit Hot and Crowded,"This fort is located on the Aguada-Siolim Road in Sinquerim (Candolim, Goa). Overlooking the vast expanse of blue waters in front of it, Fort Aguada is one of the most popular tourist destinations of Goa. The confluence of the Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea was of great strategic importance. Construction of the fort was undertaken by the Portuguese in the year 1609 for the purpose of keeping an eye on the movements through the waters and the nearby areas and the structure was finally complete in 1612. The Aguada fort has a four storeyed lighthouse. This lighthouse was built in 1864 and is the oldest of its kind in Asia. Part of the fort has been converted into the Aguada Jail.There is parking fee of Rs 100 per car. which is too high as compared to parking fees in other places."
289,Nice place ,"Excellent service - great food - very friendly staff and excellent cocktails. You must try the goan calamaris, Very spiced and delicious"
290,Great View!,"Built in 1606 in response to the Dutch blockade of Goa, Fort Aguada is now an excellently maintained example of Portuguese military architecture. It is one vast enclosure with a broad peripheral rampart. Opening time is 8:30 am, but though we were there late with two school groups also at the venue there was no sense of being crowded in that huge open space. Sun was beating down fiercely, shade under the lighthouse was taken up by school children waiting for their teacher. Lighthouse was not open and there was no indication that it is ever accessible to the public.There's adequate signage to put the whole experience in perspective. Great view of the sea from the north-eastern tip of the rampart, entails a bit of a walk though!"
291,Nice fort,"Built in 1612 by the Portugese to ward off Dutch and Maratha invasions, Fort Aguada stands intact facing the Arabian Sea.Its a beautiful experience walking around the fort ramparts and clicking away!!"
292,the place to find peace..more or less,built in 1612. Has a good view of the sea with an old light-house which is non-functional now. many bollywood movies were shot here. its a bit overcrowded and apart from one information board nothing is mentioned about its historical importance.
293,Crowded,"There was nothing interesting to see there. It was a walled in square with a tower on one side, that's it."
294,The waterfront accessible from the Jail is worth a visit,"This massively constructed Vauban style fortification, made from laterite blocks, with deep moat and 4 bastions, is an excellent example of 17th century military engineering. Both the Upper fort and old lighthouse and the lower fort on Sinquerim Beach are well worth extended visits to anyone interested in military history and Portugese colonialism- although most Indian visitors seem more interested in taking selfies."
295,OLD FORT,"Visit the Fort Aguada in the morning hours( it opens at 0830 hrs) or in the evening hours . Learn the salient features of the fort before you enter and visualize the functioning of the fort during that time, you will enjoy it."
296,Free fun fort,"Fort Aguada is located atop a hilltop near the mouth of the Mandovi River. Constructed in the year 1612, the main intention of the Fort was to guard Goa against the Dutch and the Marathas. The Fort offers a great view of the sea and the surrounding villages."
297,Nothing much to see.. can be avoided,"Fort Aguada was built by the Portuguese to guard the mouth of River Mandovi from invading enemy ships. It is about 30kms from Panaji, in North Goa. The entrance to the Fort is about 1/2 km long walk over broken rubble path from the main road. Considering the stiff entry fee of Rs.25/person, the neglect of this path, where vehicles are prohibited, is criminal. Inside, the one major structure is the Lighthouse which is locked & barred at the base. Again, a shocking case of neglect. The Fort is nothing more than a long low compound wall from the inside. The large underground Water Tank of historical importance is also locked for preventing entry without any description board. Quite unimpressive. Even the Toilets are badly maintained with drain pipes of urinals missing. Fort Aguada is a striking case of badly maintained & neglected historical site with a stiff entry fee."
298,Heritage and scenic,"Fort Aguada is a well-preserved fort, along with a lighthouse, standing in Goa, India, overlooking the Arabian Sea."
299,Ok Fort,"Worth a visit, but don't go significantly out of your way. Some good views, but personally I enjoyed the walk (about 1 hour from Candolim) more than the fort itself. Arrive before 10.30am to avoid the crowds and heat."
