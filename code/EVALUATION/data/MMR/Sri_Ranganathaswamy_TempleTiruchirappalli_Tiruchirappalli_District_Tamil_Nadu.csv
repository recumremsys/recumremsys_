0,First among 108 Divya desam..,"Recently I visited this temple. Neatly maintained and due to covid-19 , the temple allows devotees in small groups with proper social distancing.. mask should be weared, hands are sanitised using an automatic hand sanitizer machine..  since there are only limited people allowed  for Darshan, you could have a good Darshan of Lord Ranga..‚Ä¶"
1,One of the Pride of Indians,I recently visited this temple with family.The temple is the must visit temple in trichy.The temple holds its pride with various history and depicting paintings all around.The mail lord here is lord Vishnu and it is one of the 108 Divya Desams stalams.Do visit it to get amazed more.
2,Awesome experience,For first timers this visit to the temple will be unforgettable. With the highest temple Gopuram in India the temple is vast complex and a must visit place for all Hindus. You have to select the correct dates to visit the temple to have dharshan of Swami Ranganathar with less‚Ä¶
3,Not to be missed.,A temple that must be visited by every person who visits trichy. The beauty has been maintained except the shoes based inside the temple.
4,Massive temple complex!,A huge temple and a must for any temple visitor. We were lucky to get accommodation near the temple and spend quite a team visiting this huge temple complex.
5,What to see in Srirangam,Very clean but very crowdy always. Here lord vishnu is in laid position. It's a very famous temple in Trichy
6,Magnificent temple,"What a beauty. Excellent temple and a must visit one . Main deity is lord Vishnu . we have visited last week . its was crowded and can see long queues . But there are paid queues for Rs .50 and Rs.250 . if yo uhave any other plans please don't go here coz we don't know how long it will take to get the Darsan . Anyway you will be satisfied the moment you see Perumal and all the pain , that you were suffered will go . the big temple towers will comes to your mind when you try to remember Srirangam be in your mind . I swear ."
7,Massive,This is a must see temple in south india.  Great maintenance of temple.  Lord is amazing.   We could spend any amount of time sitting in the temple peacefully.
8,Abode of penance,"This temple has many Temples within. Takes about few hours to explore the entire temple. There was a queue to pray to the main deity, Sri Ranganathar. However it was worth the wait to get in to be blessed. Of course there are various opportunities to avoid the queue. One of it is paying to skip the line. The temple has a pleasant and peaceful atmosphere. The priests will explain the history and rationale behind the deities and the positioning and this provided good learning moments while we were there. This is a must visit temple at Trichy and suggest to plan a few hours for this visit. Worth it."
9,do not miss the shopping in the first & second level,This Temple is relatively known wide by almost all the people.This Temple is famous for its -01. Entrance high Gopuram whichbcab be seen miles away from srirangam.. 02. Very tall Garudan sitting in the entrance of the Ranganatha swamy sannithi 03. Amirtha kalasam yenthiya karudan sannithi opposite to the Prasadam stall.. 04. Sonna vannam seitha perumal sannithi.. 05. Dhanvanthiri sannithi 06. Kambar mandapam07. Sorkavaasal dharsinam 08. Mettu azhagiya singer sannithi09. Ramanujar (Udayavar sannithi) This Temple has around 80 sannithis. All are important..  I have mentioned the sannithis which many people are not seeing..
10,Had been there to witness Vaikunda Ekadasi.,Its a very big temple with many entrance and not that much crowded. Must visit the thayaar sanidhi behind.
11,Perumal Temple,The temple is big like many other south Indian temples. The structure is very old but well maintained. Temples do not have proper guidance and signage for first-time visitors.
12,The devotee is nobody,"This temple is dedicated to Vishnu.  It has 49 separate shrines, and feels like it‚Äôs own city.  Go in the morning when it is cool.  You have to remove your shoes and pay 10 rupees to the shoe keeper.  There is a charge to go in."
13,What a temple is!! Tough to see main lord,"A must visit while in the area or even otherwise.  Divine for the faithfuls.  Well maintained and crowded with devotees at all times.  However, there is a special entry fee of 250.00 in local currency for a hassle free line."
14,SRI RANGAM,Love this temple for the architecture and the serene environment & atmosphere. Awesome Entrance(Rajagopuram).  Historic place.  Greenery everywhere.
15,Absolutely stunning temple!,A nicely build temple with lot of hardworks.. an must visit place in trichy . Good  icon and devotional place to know about Sri ranganathaswamy.
16,A divine experience,"This is one of the holy places in India. This temple complex is pretty huge. Wheelchair is available for differently-able people. Vishnu is the main deity. The sleeping posture of the deity is so divine. During festival seasons and holidays, expect a huge crowd. Would recommend‚Ä¶"
17,Beautiful and huge Temple,Huge site. Wonderful site with many structures. Most temples are adorned with colourful sculptures but there is also a white temple as well as a golden temple. A photographers delight. Excellent.
18,Wonderful experience of rich culture and traditions ,"I visiting this temple on 2/9/2018, Very big and beautiful templeüòç In Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple reclining form of the Hindu deity Vishnu, located in Srirangam, Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India!üôè"
19,A sacred Temple Visit,"The temple complex is huge, spacious and beautiful. We visited the temple in the evening and also the following morning. The evening time was good since it was not very hot. But it started raining heavily just as we got out of the temple. In the morning, we reached there at‚Ä¶"
20,Very very poor organization!,Rs 250 is the special entry charge per person to have quick Darshan without any xtra frills. Temple is ancient and must visit for everyone!
21,Temple timings,"This is a great temple but if one wants to get Sri Ranganathar's darshan, I'll would strongly suggest to go to the temple in the morning from 5am onward but before 7am as the main sanctum will be closed at 7.30am and open at 09.30am. However, the timing is not predictable other than morning 5am onward. It will take about 2 to 3 hours to complete viewing the temple completely. Some sannathis are closed at 09.30am and some at 10.30am. Timing is really confusing. Worth visiting even it is going to take you 3 hours."
22,Divya Dharsan,"This is a huge temple in Sri rangam. We had a great darshan, once in the evening and once early in the morning. Lots of deities are there. The viswarupa seva in the morning between 6am and 7.15 am is very good. We went at about 5.30 am and got tickets. The tickets are limited. So you need to go early to get them. The morning darshan was very pleasant."
23,MUST VISIT TEMPLE,"This is really a huge and impressive Temple complex. Unfortunately, owing some repair/maintenance work, some areas were not accessible in March 2018. Since we were not aware that the main sanctum of the temple remains closed from 5.30 to 7 pm, we had to spend time moving around‚Ä¶"
24,Beautiful temple.,"We visited on 15th June 2018. The temple complex is in a vast area of 156 acres. It has 7 prakaras or enclosures.There are 21 magnificient towers in all prakaras. This temple lies on an islet formed by twin rivers Cauvery and Coleroon. This temple is thousanda of years old. The presiding deity is lord Ranganather. There are about 53 upa-sannathis.The important sannathis are for Thayar, Chakkarathazwar,Ramanujar,Garudalwar and Hayagrevar."
25,vaishnavite thivya thesam temple visit enriched my cells,The best part of this place: 1 is a good fighter 6 offers to see the entire Temple premises. Also this is built so huge that it takes nearly a 4-5 hour walk to see the every bit of the marvelous architecture. The entrances of the temples are huge and great. The architectural‚Ä¶
26,Gopurams Galore,Good temple to visit. But it is commercialized with different categories of entry fees. Family who are carrying babies can avoid standing in a queue because it is suffocating due to the crowd. The ground level staff who manages the crowd doesn't treat and respect people good.
27,Architectural Wonder,"The colour , sounds and smells of this temple are a sensory overload . This is a very active temple with a long history.  Streets are filled with worshippers , incense , garlands of flowers and the soaring temple itself make for a visual feast. Find a caf√© and just sit and‚Ä¶"
28,"""An ancient vast Vaishnava temple on the banks of the River Cauvery & Kollidam....""","The layout of the temple is interesting, and it is easy to reach by bus.The architecture is similar to Minakshi temple, though not quite as elaborate."
29,Family visit,This is a great temple but not well maintained and some of the priests can be rather rude chasing everyone rather than allow the people some peace to view the deity. You might want to pay for the 'express pass' and at least with that they will provide a bit more respect and‚Ä¶
30,Ancient temple unique architecture,If you like Dravidian architecture & appreciate the scale of time to build these temples then you will not be disappointed. The walk around is certainly worth it and it is also worthwhile going with a guide to enrich the experience. 
31,Holy Place,Peace and Calm place to visit. But people and Priest make it difficult to view the Lord idol. However i had a some good time spending extras. Its very huge temple.
32,flight hub,"Dedicated to Vishnu, this is a massive temple complex. The main entrance gate is massive and highly decorates. You walk thru a number of gates before you get to the centre of the complex( where only Hindus can enter). The central parts of the complex are well carve and there are a lot of granite pillars, there is a a large Garuda shrine but no photos. All in all I thought this was really worth visiting.  You can wear socks here and ....... you should as there are a lot of hot stone slabs!‚Ä¶"
33,Devotional,Winter months are seasonal months for visit. Grand temple with 7 Praharams. Architecture is splendid as is a feature of temples of Southern India. Lord Vishnu can be seen in a lying down position. It is first of the 108 Divya Desams of Lord Vishnu. A must-visit temple any Vaishnavite or people interested in Pilgrimage.
34,Good temple but expensive on the tickets,"its a huge temple complex with many towers, very well maintained, many local shops around and inside the temple, I visited about 10:30 and found it was crowded, I took and auto from the hotel to the temple as locals suggested its difficult find space for parking and it was true - I highly recommend this temple, A must visit"
35,The very first Temple of 108 Divyadesams.. ,The temple is designed for the lord vishnu.It is a very famouse temple.The temple is always crowded.
36,Great and amazing divine place,Best place to visit. One day is not enough to see all the deities within this temple complex. Best time to visit is during Ekadesi (Mid December to Jan) pagal pathu and ra pathu (10 days & 10 Nights).And this temple has festivals throughout the year. Variety Rice in Prasad Stall is awesome. Its my all time favorite. Must try once.
37,‚ù§Ô∏è,One of the 108 Divya Desam. Temple is beautiful. We need to really wonder at the architecture. How can one construct such a heavenly temple without modern equipment. Hats off. One of the oldest temples of TamilNadu. SriRanganatha Swamy (Mahavishnu in reclining form) and Thayar‚Ä¶
38,Nice temple ,Must visit place to see the beauty of Tamigzh Architecture. One of the largest hindhu temple in India.
39,"2nd Largest temple in the world - Amazing construction, architecture and the sannidhis",Interesting temple and even more interesting architecture - well planned. However beware of people asking for money for special blessings or performing special pooja(prayers ) for you.
40,Battery car available for Main Sannadhi s,Very nice place. Ancient temple. Built by 7 kings and it's the second largest hindu temple. They allow cameras till 3 circle of the temple. Last 2 circles they won't allow cameras but can carry mobile. They charge for cameras and top view. Don't miss the top view where one can see all the 21 gopurams  (temple tower)
41,One of the 108 Divya Desams of Vaishnavites,"visit the temple at 430 to avoid long queues and take the special darshan Rs 50 INR as it avoids too much queue and is as good as the 250 one.the temple is an standing testimonial to the Hindu culture and houses many small deities inside which will take atleast three to four hours to visit all. evenings are the best time to visit and avoid public holidays as its get excessively crowded.you can carry your camera inside and take photos except of the main deity.a must visit place just to see the sheer massiveness of the temple complex and the ''Gopurams""."

Free,‚Çπ50 & ‚Çπ250. Check for the crowd before you opt for 250 Q. Never visit during 11 am - 4 pm. You can't‚Ä¶"
45,Devotional,"biggest temple in India ( its really huge), we have visited this temple on sunday afternoon and we have got very good darashana of load Ranganatha.normally some of the devotees will cover all three temples of ranganatha swamy on one day (adi ranga(srirangapattana, karnataka),  madhya ranga (Shivanasamudra, karnataka) and antya ranga (Srirangam, Tamilnadu)).But we just visited this temple directly, we enter the main enterance at 1:30 PM and in en-query section told us that temple will open (ranganatha swamy) at 2;30 PM and we dont have any rush so he stand for normal darashana.If you need urgent darashana there is an option of 50 rs and 250 rs darashana.As there was very less crowd so we gone for normal darashana and it take us around 45 min to get darashana.there is lot of other temples inside the premises, so it will take you around 2 hours to cover all the temples.Note: -if you are travelling in summer please dont leave your footwear in the 1st gopuram, in the 3rd gopuram, there is a clock room and footwear stand for pilgrims."
46,Visit to Kanchipuram and Trichy.,It's one of the famous vaishnava temple and I believe it's historical origin is from 11th century. It is such a huge temple and spread across more than 100 acres. The temple is located between Cauvery and kolladam rivers. The interesting feature is one can have darshan of main diety from close proximity. The temple is truly symbol of marvellous Dravidian architecture.
47,One of the Must Visit Temple,"Very beautiful and historic temple. Lord Vishnu in full splendor. A very divine experience.We started from Bengaluru at 4 in the morning on our trip of Adi Ranga (Srirangapattana, Karnataka), Madhya Ranga (Shivanasamudra, Karnataka) and Anthya Ranga (Srirangam, Tamilnadu).‚Ä¶"

51,Divine blessings from Lord Ranganatha,This is one of the most ancient and sacred Vishnu temples in India abut its ruined by the greedy Management.

52,Religious Visit,"One of the most revered temples in South India but amazing architecture and gopurams. However, the queues are too long even for paid darshans. it took us 4 hours to have darshan despite being in the fastest queue. and the pundits kept pulling people away as soon as the turn‚Ä¶"

57,Magnificent Vishnu temple,"Rich with history, amazing architecture , this temple , the largest functioning temple of Sanatan Dharma in the world, is simply awe inspiring. Many superlatives are used to describe the temple - the big idol of Vishnu, resting as Sheshnaga; the large area - more than 150 acres;‚Ä¶"
58,Calm and serene atmosphere,Beautiful temple The ancient temple and positive vibes definitely contribute to a very spiritual experience.
59,No words could explain the speciality of this Temple.. ,"This place is so beautiful and the art is awesome unmatchable art , As said this very old temple probably 11th Century. This should be a must visit temple normally queue takes 2 -4 hrs or VIP darshan 30 minutes to 1 hour need to pay for it "
60,Awesome temple,"This is an architectural marvel with huge Temple towers and many prakaras and excellent workmanship in stone.It is located on an Island between River Cauvery and Kolladam and estimated to be 1300 yrs old.The northern tower, which was not completed for nearly 350 yrs,as it collapsed several times in 16th century,was completed by 44th Ahobila Mutt Jeer.It can be seen from quite a distance with a height of 250 feet.Srirangam is 15 KM away from Trichy."
61,Peaceful visit with my family,"Reach the temple venue by 6am during weekends so that you wont miss the Darshan as the main deity will be closed for public by 8pm and reopened by 9:30 am only. We entered via the east gopuram (white tower) as it is less crowded to park the vehicle.Be aware that the main deity Shri Ranganathar is big, just behind the Urchavar, many fail to notice and just see the urchavar due to poor crowd management as the priests simply shout at the bhakts to move fastly.You can spend a lot of time in this shrine post getting darshan from the main deity as this temple is full of sculptures, an architectural wonder. It also houses 1000 pillar hall (ayiram kaal mandapam) but always locked up by Aranilayathurai (temple ministry). You can watch from outside, it‚Äôs visible. (Check attached photo)Prasadam is good here don‚Äôt forget to get to eat the puliyogarai ‚Çπ20 and Vadai offered to Sri Ranganathar at ‚Çπ15. Enjoy the shrine visit with your family, please be responsible to keep the temple premises clean."
62,Visit,There is always rush in the temple and while on pilgrimage to temples to save time one will have to resort to special tickets for darshan. There is a magnetic feeling and one gets totally in trance while in front of the diety. Great feeling. We worshipped goddess Mahalakshmi also. The thousand pillar mandapam is really beautiful
63,The first Divyadesam temple,"Sri Rangam is special.. It is Saturday and not just another Perumal Temple..this time ‚Äúthe rich and lazy‚Äù Ranganathar..lazy because he is always lying down..Pallikonda Perumal..! As usual, paid a dutiful visit to Udayavar (Ramanujar) Sannidhi and also had a glimpse at the Golden Tower and White Tower..among so many different towers and shapes, these are unique at Sri Rangam"

A Must visit place for all the Vaishnavites (Worshipper of Lord Vishu). This temple also has many deities like Goddess and other deities like Shri Rama, Chakraalwar,‚Ä¶"
72,Vacation ,"Though mostly good experience some of the temple staff can be more courteous to the visitors, especially tourists, which would attract more and more genuine tourists both domestic and international."

78,Nice temple,This is one of the famous vishnu temple. From trichy you get continuous bus facilities to this temple. The good vishu will be in the lying position and it's too big. There is free darshan as well paid darshan. Since I visited on weekday there is not much rush.
79,Heaven on earth,this temple history is known to everyone. the Lord Padmanabha statue was carried by vibhishan and he got tired and kept the statue at the bank of the cauvery river. he took some rest and after his rest he decided to pick the padmanabha statue and leave for Lanka. But he could‚Ä¶

84,Temple Timings are erratic,A good spritual place in tamilnadu.An excellent temple complex. Huge wait for darshan inspite of paying 250. They stop you at multiple places and you only get a fleeting glance. The temple complex is nice to see with a huge garud at the entrance. Happy journey
85,Worth seeking out,A Marvel and a mammoth architecture at the belt of Cauvery river. Well maintained and clean. you can spend at least 3 hours in this temple as you have lot of places to see at your leisure.
86,HSTORICAL TEMPLE,"TN Govt has done a splendid job. Food is served in a neatly maintained hall whole through the day. Food is definitely of good hygiene and sufficient quantity. Of course no frills....it is free of cost. Anyone can sponsor it too by logging in online in the temple website.For family functions like wedding, anniversary, birthday etc., we needn't search ashrams and organise at extra cost. The flexibility is...You can pay any amount you like. We are able to get a certificate to for IT relief. I have done this for 3 years. I did go there anonymous, ate and found it is worth donating."
87,Temple which has its famouse,huge temple with very big gopuram. No.1 Divya Desam temple. Very good architect. Take a guide to go around for 2 hours to take lot of input.

89,Management need to improve the facility,Beautiful temple with grand architecture. Happened to witness the morning viswaroopa darisanam which was awesome. Since it was very crowded in early morning we have to take 250rs ticket for the darisanam. It took an hour. Cleanly maintained temple. Very big praharam. Ramanuja temple was attractive. Visit the temple in early morning to avoid heat. We can‚Äôt walk in the temple corridor in hot sunny afternoons. One disappointment was the moolasthanam priests were very harsh and they literally push people not allowing them to see the lord even for a minute even in 250 rs ticket. They can be bit soft because all have to worship the lord peacefully. Very big and beautiful temple with positive vibration.
90,Suitable place for Pilgrims and Tourists ,"One of the oldest temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. oldest temple and maintained very well. The temple is counted among the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu. Also this is built so huge that it takes nearly a 4-5 hour walk to see the every bit of the marvelous architecture. Hired a guide Kali muthu available at counter where camera permission tickets are sold. we hired him for Rs.350/- worth the amount paid. very knowledgeable and makes your visit to the temple a memorable one. He can be contacted on Mobile no-9894289163. The entrances of the temples are huge and great. The architectural beauty is clearly evident of the Chola dynasty. Every bit and piece of the built are extremely good. It has taken me nearly 4.5 hours for complete visit of the temple premises. Sesharaya Mandap is exemplary of craftsmanship of our ancestors. The Mandap is adorned by Pillars. The pillars consists of sculptures of wildly rearing horses bearing riders on their backs and trampling with their hoofs upon the heads of rampant tigers, seem only natural and congruous among such weird surroundings. Overall experience is lovely. Must watch when you are there in Tiruchirappalli. Thousand pillar hall still under renovation. Dont forget to visit Mortal remains of Sri Ramanujacharya, more than eight hundred years old."
91,Spiritual retreat,Immensely beautiful and huge temple not only provide a tranquil divine atmosphere for the mind and soul but also a good walking for the body...what more...wonderful food at the temple prasadham stall...dont miss their traditional temple delicacies that are sold here after offering to the Lord
92,"Sri Ranganathaswamy temple Srirangapattana,Karnataka",What an architecture in the huge campus full of temples. Large campus with almost all the deities and main temple memories will remain forever
93,Simply Amazing,"We visited the temple on a busy day. Long queue as expected. We took the 250rs ticket to join a faster line. Be mindful if you have a baby / toddler. Carry lots of water/milk & a hat for the child as they can get quite irritated in the waiting process. Try to visit the temple as early as possible, so you can avoid long queues & the sun. It is hard to walk around the temple when it‚Äôs hot. It was well worth the wait for us to see the idol. I wish there was a seperate queue for families with small children & older people."
94,Magnificent Temple,"This is the major attractions of trichy,this temple was called as sri renganathar temple,this temple has a lot of towers and one of the inner towers is gold plated and this is famous for antiques and one of the oldest temple of india,this is the best level temple  it is situated in sri rangam"
95,Lord Vishnu Darshan,generally between 3 to 5 pm is the best time to visit this temple (unless otherwise it closed for for special reason)
96,It's like a small village in itself.,"The Ranganatharswamy temple is the largest temple complex in India. The entire complex is clean with orderly queues in each of the temples. A Divine heavenly feeling when you go through the entire complex, see the huge magnitude of each of the unique gopurams."
97,Marvellous Dravidian Architecture,"A must place to visit, with the serene surroundings and clean environment. best place of worship for a peace of mind."
98,FIRST OF FIRST DIVYADESAMS,"Srirangam temple is very huge, beautiful architecture temple, must visit in Trichy, swamy was really good. Near by we get nice food."
99,Beautiful sight,This is the temple you need to visit atleast once in a lifetime. Its architecture and massive infrastructure is so huge that you will feel that you are in a city inside another city. There are 7 dwarams ( doors ) to Vaikuntham and the same is reflected in the construction of‚Ä¶
100,Must visit temple in Trichy,Worth seeing. Need time to enjoy all aspects of this temple which can be considered a masterpiece of art esp the Krishna Temple at the entrance
101,Roof Top views,"There are lot of reviews of the temple. To do justice at least 3-4 hours is required to enjoy the experience of the temple. Do pick few traditional items from the market, we thought it would be available in Tanjore or in town but we could not get it. Nice iron kitchen items and wooden dolls are there"
102,better choice than Madurai,Very historical place and I think one of the must visit temple with including the Ucchi Pillayar Rockefort Temple. 
103,"Majestic, unusually beautiful","Sri Rangam temple which was once at par with Tirumala Temple is situated in 157 acres of land. Around 5 km from the city.The sanctum is situated at the centre of around 6 layers of fort.. That itself shows how rich the temple would have  been. The southern gopuram is the biggest and most colourful of the four. The eastern gopura is painted white in remembrance of the Devadasi Vellai(white) who helped the priest to  protect the main idol from being looted by the Muslim invaders. Other attractions include the 1000 pillar mantapa. But be ready to spent more time here in your itinerary plan, as the temple opens and closes now and then and usually having very high rush here  If you dont have time but money  to spare , you can have special darshan ticket for Rs 250."
104,"Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple, Srirangam",This temple is huge and the architecture   is marvellous.There are many deities in the temple and the main deity is Lord Ranganatha. The temple is well maintained and is easily accessible for all the devotees young and old. There are battery cars operating inside the temple to help the poor and differently abled.
105,Amazing temple,"A very important temple for all Hindus, especially for Vaishnavites. Devotees throng the temple and it is sad to see how little importance is given to them. The line forms soon after you clear the cursory security check. But for the first 100 ft or so it is a very loose formation till you came to the barriers. There r 3 ticket classes- Rs 250, Rs 50 and free. But for the next half hour everyone is in a common queue. And then the queues separate. I don‚Äôt understand why the queues don‚Äôt get separated right at the beginning. And after a long wait you finally get into the sannidhi. And the moments of bhakti get thoroughly spoilt by the security guys who keep yelling useless instructions and push you and pull you rudely. You don‚Äôt get that moment of peace in your mind when you are in the Lord‚Äôs presence! What a travesty of devotion. And every so often the queues are broken by devotees who ‚Äòknow‚Äô the right people"
106,Architectural Paradise,"Very huge vishnava temple.excellent place to explore the architecture of different old south Indian kingdoms over time.We went during Dhanur maasam, hence the rush was too much.went in at 2pm into the queue and came out after darshan at 8pm (rs250/- ticket)."
107,Srirangam Temple more to go,"Beautiful temple, if you don't like crowds, better to take the paid ticket for darshan. The Lord is beautiful. It has a sign outside Lord Ranganath temple that says ""only hindus"" since I am not by birth I was a bit concerned, but since I was dressed in a sari I guess they didn't‚Ä¶"
108,Perumal,"This is the temple for Lord Maya Vishnu. Lord Maha Lakshmi. I took 250 rupees ticket, I finished my darshan in less than 30 min.  Even you have options of Dharma darshan and 50 rupees also... Very big and beautiful temple.  Should have patience."
109,Biggest and most Divine Vaishnavite temple - Srirangam,"We visited this temple in May. It was very hot summer, but OK if u visit early in morning or late in evening. It is a beautiful temple of Lord Ranganathaswamy in reclining pose on the 7 headed serpent. The idol is gigantic in black stone. The idol really inspires awe, devotion‚Ä¶"
110,Huge temple complex,"There is a difference in just attending the temple and having a rich spiritual experience. The real blessings of the temple come as we enhance our temple experience. To do so, we must feel a spirit of reverence for the temple and a spirit of worship."
111,Booked through online and had a quick darshan,Feels rejuvenated while being there..Ancient and big temple of Ranganathar (Maha Vishnu).One of the biggest temples of Lord Krishna in south India.Beautifully built architecture and charming Deity.One can go near to the Deity of the Lord to worship.It's really a memorable experience of visit over here.

113,Mind Blowing!,"massive temple, one day is insufficient to see the entire temple. 21 Koburams (towers) each unique in its own way."
114,Lord vishnu !!!,Huge temple complex of holy atmosphere ! Need at least half a day to cover the visit. Very ancient place of worship. The reclining God Vishnu ji is life like. The golden vimaanam is glittering ! Make it a point to climb  up to  have a 360 degree view of the magnificent temple‚Ä¶
115,Devotional,visited on 31 mar 18. it is a hugh temple and ancient one. it is located inside market area. If you don't know tamil you had it. no one understands hindi and english. even guide was not available. no information available anywhere. no one could provide any information about‚Ä¶

117,Local call taxi,A majestic creation by humans of older days. Very ancient place but the spoilers i Here are the poojaris inside and the commercial shops outside.
118,"Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple, Srirangam","I alongwith my family visited Tiruchy in December 2017 mainly to see the famous Temples. Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple is located on a large area having 3 temples in a row and is very beautiful looking from its design, art work and the overall view. We liked it very much. "
119,"Must visit Temple - Sri Rangam, Sriranganathar - Al mighty","My friend took me to this temple very early in the morning for Viswarupam darshan. The main door was opened when the temple elephant, cow and a horse assembled before the diety and they woke up the LORD . Then only we were all allowed to go inside and have the darshan. The experience was thrilling and it can not be explained in words."
120,Worth the visit,All those who wants to have a darshan of Lord Vishnu in his lying pose and who don't get an opportunity to visit Padmanaabhaswamy temple in Trivandrum must pay a visit to this temple. One whole day is required to comfortably admire the beauty of this temple. A must visit.
121,Free food for the needy...And opportunity to sponsor!,"Re-visit to history, Awesome construction of temple with well carved structures.Big idol of Lord Vishnu resting on Sheshnag. Unfortunately you can take photos inside the temple."
122,A temple as grandiose as its size,This a must to see temple for all Hindus once in their lifetime.The main deity's idol is well maintained from head to toe & it took about 30 minutes for us to have darshan through Rs 250/- ticket. The only thing which annoyed us is that the timings of Padmavati Temple is not in line with the main temple as it closes by 8 P.M. where as the main temple is open till 9 P.M. I hope this will be taken well by the temple authorities to have Padmavati temple also open till 9 P.M.The prasad sold by the temple trust was very tasty.
123,Ranganathaswamy Swamy Temple,One of the ancient temple Lord Vishnu is the main lord always crowded place. The temple is maintained very well and in hygienic way.
124,Amazing place,The place is exceptional without a doubt. Takes you a good 3h to check out all the temples in the complex. Plus another hour or so(depending on what time you visit ) for the darshan.  Not so good facilities for keeping the camera while going into the inner sanctuary as people‚Ä¶
125,Soulful temple ‚ù§Ô∏è,"When we visit there we always prefer to have divine prasad at temple, almost all varieties are good, delicious and its very reasonable price. Especially original vada is wonderful, crisp - real taste of divine and blessings."
126,Awesome experience,An excellent temple complex. Huge wait for darshan inspite of paying 250. They stop you at multiple places and you only get a fleeting glance. The temple complex is nice to see with a huge garud at the entrance. 
127,Heaven on earth,Srirangam was one of those places one should always visit when around trichy. It was made more holi with cauvery and pushkaram. Nice darshan
128,Visit to the Holy Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple,Very nice place to visit its a old and very big temple we got the dharshan its make us happy and its very well connected witg public transport.
129,Beautiful Temples within temple,What a treat. These Temples date back to the 10th. Century and newer. Beautiful architecture and colors. These cover blocks and blocks of the town which they incorporated into the every day life of the people. This is a must do. You can pay to go up to the roof and get some amazing views and pictures of the entirety of this all. Beautiful statues plus. Great for the entire family.
130,Beware of the crowd!,"The Lord, Vishnu in Sayanakkoalam is at its best in Srirangam..very crowded on festive days. So, plan ahead..temple Seva and Dharshan tomest vary significantly over days and festive times..check shop keepers and first finish sannidhis that are open...it is a divine gift to get to see Ramanujar (Udayavar)..."
131,Good darshan ,This temple is a Vishnu temple who is worshipped in a sleeping posture as ranganathar. This is very near thiruchy and thanjavur. Covering all these is easy and divine.
132,Superb temple,We visited the temple as part of our visit to Trichy. We landed into the line in the temple compund at around 6 30 and opted to go through the free one (50 and 250 options) as there was not much crowd. It did take 15-20 mins to reach the main shrine once the temple doors of the‚Ä¶
133,Beautiful Templeüòç,"Even if you don't like temples go and see this one. It is vast as well as having huge religious significance. Trichy is South India's equivalent of the big religious site on the Ganges. With our guide we were able to go up on a roof for even better views of the complex and some stunning photos. He knew all the best positions for getting them.  It is all so massive it is hard to take in, but look closely and the details are superb too.‚Ä¶"

135,good swamy dharshan,"One of the biggest Vishnu (prime Hindu deity) temples in the world ! Scintillating architecture married to solemn spirituality ! Visited for the first time in my life and was awed by the structure, the architecture, design and timeless construction. Its the only Vishnu temple having God Vishnu in a reclining state ! It was an auspicious and humbling experience ! A must visit temple site."
136,Excellent Temple Complex,"Just a word: stunning. This temple is the reason why Trichy must be visited. It is large beyond imagination. It is colorful. It is full of life. Two or three hours are needed to visit the temple. Just take time to walk around, begining with the rooftop viewpoint: it is not an all emcompassing view, but it is nice and allows one to better understand the size of the place and height of the gopurams. Many places inside the temple are not allowed to non Hindus, but there's still enough to see and enjoy."

The Lord is in a lying posture is a feast to eyes. Don't forget to visit Shri Ramanujar where the idol is supposed to be of Shri Ramanujar‚Ä¶"
151,Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple,This temple is an example of typical Dravidian Culture. The gate is very large and nicely sculptured. The main temple has large area and the queue is properly maintained. It is a Vishnu Temple where The Lord Vishnu is in Anantshajya.

158,A very Religious and Important temple in Wrong Hands,The Temple complex is huge and there are many smaller shrines inside. The sanctum dedicated to the Vaishnava Saint Bhagavad Ramanuja is a highlight of the Temple. The atmosphere is very devotional.
159,Majestic Perumal temple,"Ranganatha Swami temple at Srirangam is indeed heaven on earth, it is the second largest temple (area) on earth and the largest active functioning temple on this planet. It is the 1st out 108 Divya Desam (premium places of Swami Vishnu) and the temple is just mind boggling‚Ä¶"
160,Place must to visit,"I went on a crowded day,There is no proper management team inside temple. There is no equality. If you have big hands and big pockets you could see the god fast. It is an tiring experience even standing in Rs.250 line. You would forget all this when you see the God. I loved the samba dosa prasadam, hard like rock. Go on a less crowded day to see the architecture of the and to feel the divine."
161,A must visit ,Though we had visited this temple earlier this time we visited during a temple festival. A bit msddenning crowd and people tend to manhandle. So better avoid during remple festival seasons
162,Temple of Gopurams,"We were rather late when we went to this temple and reached around 7 30 pm. The 250 Rs Q in itself was over crowded and they had stopped issuing the tickets due to a puja. After almost 30 minutes - 1 hour of waiting the tickets were issued. Once inside the sanctum, we were not‚Ä¶"

165,Beautiful Lord Vishnu temple,"Of course, the grandest of temples here and as usual lot of crowd. You need a fulll day to see every deity in the temple and that may not be enough also. Temple has specific timings and its better to check  (mostly morning till noon and 4pm till 8pm I guess)   Took us 1.5 hours‚Ä¶"

Lots of shops outside.. only thing was .. there were so many people inside the sannidhi asking for money.. we didn't know who to give and who not to give. Overall an amazing experience.

170,One of the great temples dedicated to Vishnu,Temple with lots of carvings and ancient monument. It had big queue but still was able to see the swamy dharshan at time and it gives pleasant and heart touching moment.
171,Noisy and Dangerous,"Is the management sleeping? No proper organization, yet 250 rs for a hassle free darshan. Seriously, this temple management needs a lesson or two to learn from Meenakshi Amman temple or Azhaghar or Tirupati temple, which are far better organized for far lesser fare. Poor‚Ä¶"
172,Vishnu temple,"Temple managed by Devasthanam . Important Vaishnavaite spot , One of 108 Divya desam. On the Banks of Cauvery "
173,Beautiful Temple,"This temple is number 1 among the 108 ""Divya Desham' Sri Vaishnavaite temples, rated even higher than the Tirumala temple. It is an amazing temple with Lord Vishnu in his ""Anantha Sayanam"" (relaxing) pose. The Samprokshanam (cleansing and re-invigorating) having been done just a year back, the premises is spic and span. The Lord and the Thaayar (Goddess Ranganayaki) are liberally blessing all devotees. It is a 'must go' for all Hindus. The crowd was large and the timings when the temple is open for Darshan are a bit erratic due to their internal pooja schedules. One has to plan in advance and should be willing to spend a few extra hours if need be, to get the Lord's Darshan."
174,In the list of historic temples,The timings displayed in the notice board are not followed and pilgrims are put into a lot of difficulty without any proper guidance. 
175,Ranganatha Swamy temple,Astonishing planning and execution of this temple town where the streets are located inside with giant walls guarding on all 4 sides.

178,Awesome Experience,this is the tallest gopuram in temples of india.this is one of the largest hindu temple in the world.i got darshan quickly due to i visited early morning.
179,The biggest temple complex in the world and love to spend during the time spent inside the temple complex.,We have visited many temples but Ranganathaswamy has to be one of the very best.This is the world‚Äôs largest functioning Hindu temple and is quite exquisite.  We visited during the Pongal Festival and it was fascinating to see so many pilgrims in their colourful costumes.  We had an excellent guide who rather poignantly told us some of the history of the Vellayi Gopura (the white tower) which is well worth researching.  Highly recommended.
180,Thiruvaranga Tirupati- Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple,"Very well organised. Neat and clean. Buggy facility available for senior citizens. When not very crowded 50 rupees Darshan Wil give u a quick and easy Darshan. Various types of Prasad are available. Depending on how much you want to walk, you can select the right entry."
181,A majestic temple,This huge temple complex can take a month to explore. However if you are in a hurry you can take the Rs. 250 ticket and manage to complete the main diety and his consort in 2 hours during the holiday season. Time in front of the diety is as little as 5-10 seconds after waiting‚Ä¶
182,Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple,Must see place in India. Truly a heritage site.Magnificent structure built with charismatic sculptures.
183,Not to be missed!,This abode of Ranganatha Swamy is the vaikuntham on earth. The architecture of this temple is magnificent and the rajagopuram is truly majestic.

185,Breathtaking view. you must do this 100%,"We,a family of 3 persons,went to Sri Ranganatha swamy temple on 30th September 2017 by 10.30 a.m.There were Free Dharshan, Rs.50 Ticket and Rs.250 Ticket. There were two persons (don't know they are staff) openly telling the devotees, Free Dharshan will take 4 Hrs and Rs 250 will take 1 Hr. We had left with no other option except to go by Rs.250. It appears that admin has purposefully done. And It took 2 hrs for us to have Dharshan. Kindly note there is no entrance ticket in Tanjore Big Temple. Shiva Temple no ticket. Perumal Temple, Ticket in 2 slabs. Perumal Temple run by private?   Why there is a discrimination of ticket system. And arrangements were also poor in Perumal Temple."
186,SmallTripTo temple ,"nice place to visit, this easily accesable from railway station and central bus stand of trichy , local buses are frequently availale from 5 am to 11 pm"

It is said that here Andaal, one of the twelve Alwaars of Vaishnavism mingled one with Her Divine Lover, Maha Vishnu.  The huge temple boasts of four Gopurams and one mottai gopuram.

195,ancient temple,"this was my second visit to the Temple. During my earlier visit, I was not lucky to obtain darshan.  however, this time, I drove straight to the temple from the airport, and was lucky that it was a normal day with no big ceremonies lined up, and thus got a darshan within a hour of standing in the queue. A Darshan here and in tirumala of Lord Vishnu is very auspicious, and I was lucky to get the Darshan here in August and later at Tirumala in September. the priests were also very friendly, and let us stand for a few moments in front of the Divine Lord and in fact pointed out with their lights the form of the Sleeping Vishnu at the back too. count ourselves as lucky to have got this darshan."
196,A wonder of the past,"For the Vaishnavites, You must visit this temple for the blessings for the Ranganaha Swamy. You can also see the incarnation of the Ramanuja.

200,Temple Visit ,"If you happen to be in Trichy , this is a must visit. The temple , it‚Äôs reclining Vishnu and Garuda idols are huge and impressive. The golden dome and the golden lizards on the ceiling are all worth a see. Try to avoid weekends when apparently things get too crowded. Do keep in mind that they don‚Äôt allow photography of the inner sanctums of the temple."
201,Marvel,"It's an excellent place to visit with family and kids. Take half a day handover around slowly to cherish the architecture beauty of this great temple.If water is there is river Kaveri, then take a cautious dip.... else enjoy the glorious food of trichy and move on to Tanjore...."
202,Early Morning Darshan,The amazing thing about this complex compared to it‚Äôs cousin in Madurai is that security is not as tight and it is possible to go to an observation deck and get a wonderful 360 view of the entire complex and it‚Äôs tall intricate towers.One of the most beautiful temples I have seen.
203,One of the most important and ancient temples,what a temple. it will take you more than 24 hours to go round and see the entire temple. Correctly called as Boolaga Vaikundam. Full of positive vibrations. The real body of Ramanujar is to be seen to believe. He is still alive and blesses his devotees.
204,"One of the best Hindu temples, a must visit place",In this big temple we hired a private guide.  He spent over an hour taking us to all what we have to see and explaining the story of how Lord Visnu came to be there.
205,Blissful and active Vishnu temple,"- There is an entry fee of Rs.50 that's collected soon on entering the turn leading to the temple from the main street of Srirangam town. This is however only for outsiders, so either you could say you're not there for the temple visit, or speak fluently in tamil and say you're a localite to escape this.- Huge temple with four gates.- The most important thing that you need to be aware of here is the timings. Roughly, AFAIK, the Ranganathaswamy shrine is closed between 12:30 to 3:30. Please confirm from reliable source however.- Parking is free, and is around the temple premises. Reaching the temple premises can however become tough on special days. We however didn't face any issues."
206,Differential Dharshan,"The temple of Lord Ranganathar (reclining God) at least 1500 years old, boasts of Sapthapraharas (seven massive circular walls practically making up a whole town) visible even today.  Words cannot describe the details inside the temple - more than 50 sanctums for different angelic Gods, several ponds of great fame, several huge and artistic towers and pillars, visibly ancient with high spiritual vibrations and pilgrim-friendly staff and shops selling economically priced artefacts!  Paradise on earth - to be seen at least once in a lifetime."
207,Temples everywhere,First I would say hire a guide if you are not part of a group. We paid 500 rupees for a 2 hour guide of the temple and a further 500 to visit the rock. If you visit the rock there are approx 500 steps to climb. It is ok for the view but not spectacular. The temple was very‚Ä¶
208,Love these towers....,"Was in Trichy for a Seminar. Took early morning trip by auto to Srirangam around 0600 hours.

There are some great photos to take here, so please take your camera, you will need it today."

216,Amazing cultural experience,"In spite of the milling crowd, I got a pleasant divine experience.  Lord Ranganatha, with His Parrot Garland is a sight to behold. It is a spiritual experience."
217,Pretty big Vishnu temple,"nice temple to visit. The temple authorities should take more care to keep the temple clean. We could see some crap near the water tap area. The place is otherwise kept neat, without enough shade to help with standing in the queue."
218,amazing temple with excellent architecture,When visiting this temple complex have a look on the rooftop. You get an nice overview on all the temple towers in the area.
219,LORD VISHNU PILIGRIMAGE,"A vast sacred temple with history written all over it. It is said to be the biggest temple in Asia in terms of area. Very good arrangements are available for Darshan of the Msin Diety. However, queues converge before the main sanctum, resulting in a bit of rush. It would be‚Ä¶"

225,disappointed for not getting the Moola Vigraham,"Srirangam is famous for its Sri Ranganathaswamy temple which is one of the largest temple complex in India.Srirangam - Lord Vishu's ""self-manifested"" among few shrines, here Lord Vishu's idol (in a reclining posture) on the five headed serpent. The temple has 7 enclosures and there are 21 magnificent towers in all the enclosures.The temple is sorrounded by the river 'Cauvery'.Inside the temple complex there is seperate temple dedicated to goddess Andal(Lakshmi) additional, there is a museum, a library and couple of bookshop.Due to this famous temple,devotees come from all parts of India and abroad. The public transport linking Srirangam to Tiruchirappalli is very frequent. Must witness, one of gigantic temples in India."
226,The place of surprise,It is historic as well as one of prime most temple of vaishanavaite sect of Hindu. Huge complex and tallest of temple towers in Asia. This temple has history of attached by Delhi sultans and looted lots of treasures. Also the great epic Ramayana in tamil version by kambar got launched at this temple. Some restriction for non-hindus and foreigners...
227,Good temple with positive vibes,"Its a visual treat for your eyes. The centuries old architecture is simply awesome. Try avoiding visits on holidays & Sundays as crowd would be huge. Vaikunda Eadasi is the prime festival here. There is special entrance for Rs.250 & Rs.50 for easy access to shrine, this can be helpful to avoid waiting time in queue. Spend real good time in and around the temple premise to really enjoy the marvel."
228,Heavy rush and lots of ways to by pass it off you are ready to spend money for it.,"Visited as part of a tour group. Awesome painted towers, apart from the white one, that has an ethereal quality to it. The inside of the temple isn't overly painted so you can see all the intricate carving on the pillars.   The horse statues are worth a second and third‚Ä¶"
229,Beautiful Architecture & Art,"Fantastic! Historic, worth visiting, great Dravidian architecture and more importantly of religious significance"
230,Divine and Just divine,This is a temple worth visiting. A very huge temple complex housing quite a few gods and a sight to behold.
231,"Pilgrimage, tour",The temple has 21  Gopurams ( entrance towers) spread in 4 directions. These Gopurams are painted in multiple colours.One Gopuram is left in white colour in  memory of a devadasi(danseuse) who sacrificed her life to save the temple from depredation by Muslim invaders. The main‚Ä¶
232,Srirangam is famous for Rangathaswamy Temple,What a temple... wonderful by art and architecture and great in knowledge...it takes nearly one full day to cover the whole temple complex and it was breathtaking watching the main deity of the temple
233,Ancient Traditional Vaishnavite Temple,It's a divine place with amazing history. There are no words to describe this amazing place. Just read the history of temple before visiting. Idol makes you spellbound. Visit this place at the earliest
234,"Massive, historic temple",Bus or train travellers to srirangam don't go for Fast track call taxi they are cheating just for 8 to 9 kms they are changing Rs.500 better auto is best only 150 to 175
235,Amazing temple.  Must visit.,"By far the biggest and the best of the temples my wife and I visited on our tour of Southern India. We took in all that, as non Hindus, we could. More impressive and more welcoming than Madurai this is the temple to have on your wish list. Our guide was able to get a key to take us onto a rooftop where the views across the landscape were breath taking. Beware though there is no shade up there and you will not be wearing shoes! The temple was well maintained, colourful and as we walked around with our guide we could only marvel at the work that went into it, and goes on to this day. Truly unmissable."
236,A very holy experience - Serenity is found despite the crowd,"For all those coming to Trichy, the Ranganathaswamy temple of the riverine island of Srirangam is a must visit. A temple so large as to house the population of the city, the temple is a architectural showcase. The main deity, Sriranganathaswamy is surrounded by many more deities. The line to the main deity is very large and waiting in the free line is time-consuming. A minimum of two hours is required to reach the shrine of Sriranganathaswamy and very little time is given to see the main idol. So, I suggest getting a ticket for the fast lanes. Another important thing is in the main shrine itself. The actual idol, which is a black idol of Lord Vishnu in his lying pose is behind the golden statue of Utsavamoorthy. In the few seconds you get, most attention goes to the golden idol and not the main deity. Keep this in mind while visiting as this is a common mistake that people commit. Otherwise, the temple built by Vedanta Desikar is a must visit for all the tourists and pilgrims of Trichy"
237,Darshan of Lord Ranganatha on Dwadasi following day of Vaikunta Ekadasi,"You  must enjoy the gigantic Raja Gopuram, sprawling temple complex. Ranganathaswamy Temple must be the worlds biggest temple complex and consisting many temples or sannadis. You must visit Ranganathaswamy moolasthan, Ranganayaki Thayar sannidhi, Krishna and Srinivasa. You must also visit Ramanujar sannidhi consisdered to be suyambu. You can see Ramanuja in sitting posture. There are many sannadhis. You can easily spend more than half a day. Chkarathalwar (Sudarsan) Sannidhi is world famous. It is the first among the 108 divya desams."
238,Too much crowded,Sri Ranganatha swamy temple is the prime temple at Srirangam and one of the eight self-manifested Vishnu temples. The temple span across more than 150 acres on an island in the middle of Cauvery and collidum. The reclining arangan is the ruler and the temple is architecturally‚Ä¶
239,"Crowded place, long queues and mismanaged","It is one of the most important and very ancient temple for Lord Vishnu . The main idol is in a sleeping posture in this place and it is most beautiful . It is a huge temple complex with lots of smaller temples inside , it will take at least 3 hours to do full justice to this attraction . The Rajagopuram is magnificent , very tall and very wide and difficult to take the eyes out of it ."
240,Divine Visit,"You shouldn't miss out visiting this temple. People who have been to Tirupathi would feel no difference about area and approach to the temple with lots of shops around. Main deity is Ranganathar, other deities include thayar, narasimha Samy etc."
241,1st of the 108 divya desams,"Superb view , great architecture on the temple, since mobiles not allowed inside temple so you can't have more pics but inside so many places and statues where you will surely miss camera. Holiest place to visit. Fortunate to visit this place."
242,No feel of spirutality,nice temple to visit with friends. when you are going with family preferred special queue. when you are going with friends normal queue is fine. I used normal queue. started from 2.30 and reached for dharisanam at 4.30
243,Stunning temple,"We could visit the temple from the outside, but as a non-Hindu, you will not be allowed to enter the temple as such. Still, the outer part is worthwhile to visit."
244,Majestic,"My second trip here, took us 2 hours overall. Speechless when you see 'Him'. Good vibration. Will definitely return"
245,Good visit,of very great historical importance.....prople come from far and wide to this temple....attracts lots of tourists during winter season....
246,Very very crowded place.,This was my second trip to the temple. As earlier it was a different feeling when you enter the temple and get divya darshan of the lord. May God bless everyone. Accommodation - famous residency tiruchirappalli is a good option. Just 1.5 km away from temple with good veg food options.
247,Master Piece ,"Sri Ranganatha temple at Srirangam is the biggest and number one Vaishnavite temple. Temple is crowded through out the year especially on holidays and week ends.  on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays the crowd is less during afternoon time.Lord Rangantha on sleeping posture on Adhisesha ( Serpent) and Ranganayaki shrines are most important. There are innumerable  shrines ( around sixty) in the temple and the total temple area is around 160 acres. Temple has got more than 20 towers ( gopurams). You require around 4 to 6 hours for visiting important shrines. Vaikunta Ekadesi festival  ( 20 days) is most important festival during Dec- January every year. Lot of budget hotels are near the temple and at Tiruchy about 4 KMS from Temple."
248,The Temple,Had a wonderful darshan of lord sri ranganatha on dwadasi(the day after vaikunta ekadasi). Temple is very poorly managed. Even police constable can get 100 of people inside though lakhs of ordinary people waiting. This is ridiculous.
249,Wonderful and huge!,The place was so good and clean. It's a historic point for the city I spent almost  3 hour in it and I enjoyed a lot.
250,A marvellous temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu,Lot of crowd. Felt blessed. We went thru special darshan paying 250/- per head. Can spend more time if it was not so crowded.
251,Divine,"Surprisingly, Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple is the part of Char Dham Yatra of Hindu God Vishnu, as I always believed that Char Dhams are Badrinath, Dwarka, Jagannath Puri and Rameshwaram. But Rameswaram Temple is dedicated to God Shiva. Finally, during my visit to Rameswaram I got‚Ä¶"
252,Huge temple,"Lord Ranganathar with consort Ranga Nayaki, is present with many azhwars and the revolutionary torch bearer of Vaishnavism, Shri Ramanujar! A very old temple that was formed swayambu, thanks to Lord Ganesha persuading Vibeeshana to hand over the proto type of Sri Ranganatha, and set it along the banks of river Cauveri."
253,Very big Perumal temple,"My connection flight was 2 hours late and checked for the nearby attractions and this came on top. But still this was around 12 km from the airport. But definitely one of the most crowded temples on a usual day. You will find a lot of attractions inside the temple. You will be amazed by the different deities, mandapams, scupltures etc. The Gopurams are very huge. The Rajagopuram of this temple is considered to be the biggest temple Gopuram in the world."
254,156 acre temple,"Visited the temple after about 10 years. And it was worth the visit. Stayed for 2 and half days, out of which we spent 2 days (mornings and evenings) at the temple. We drove from Bangalore - about 7 hours drive - good roads. Stayed at yatri nivas (separate review written for the same), about a km from the North Entrance of the temple. if you have vehicle, this the ideal place to stay.The Praharams are huge. there are more than 63 Sannidihis, At every Sannidhi, the priest explains the history behind the deity. If you want to take in the length and breadth of the temple, plan to spend at at least 5 to 6 hours (with a break in between).The Entrance from the Rajagopuram side is cluttered with shops and parked vehicles. Better to go from the North or East entrance, where there is ample parking available on the road and is peaceful.For Darishanam, there is a free darshan, 50 Rs. and 250 Rs. ticket. We went just after onam festival. So, the Rs. 50 and free darshanam had long queues. Rs. 250 was less crowded. on one of the mornings, when we were standing in the Rs. 250 queue, a person came and told us that there is a 500 Rs. ticket which will be given just after the pooja. There is no mention of this anywhere and there is no counter. We were asked to wait near the kodimaram. After the pooja, at around 9:30am, we entered through a gate  near the Rs. 250 ticket counter, bought the ticket and went straight in. We had the privlege of sitting for the aarathi and then having the darishanam. The other darishanan (general, 50 and 250) start after this. Darishanam and pooja timings are in their website. For Rs. 250 ticket, best is to go about half hour after the darishanam starts. the queue will be almost nil or less. One can book online, but not really required. they take credit cards. For Vishwaroopa darsihanam (6am),we went at 5:30am, but the queue was long. So, we skipped. A horse and a cow were taken inside the  sanctum sanctorum, after which an elephant carrying the theertham for the abhishekam also followed inside. This was wonderful.in the evening at 5:30, , we saw a procession of the Lord.Don't miss the view point. One can see all the Gopurams from there.And the Prasadams - puliyogare, curd rice, dosa (a different kind), vadai etc., all priced at Rs. 15 each. This made our lunch and dinner.And the beautiful architecture opposite the Aairyam Kaal mandapam (this mandapam is usually closed).if you are willing to shell out some dakshina for the priests, you will be given royal treatment.The Chitra Veethis (the mada streets) still have the old houses and the streets are relatively clean.on the whole a very very refreshing and divine experience."
255,Boologa Vaikuntam,I want around 4:30 p.m on 23rd of March. Got VIP ticket for social dracaena and pray the Lord Ranganath
256,Nice Temple but very commercialised!,"This is stunning temple. We would be mesmerized by looking at the temple architecture. We need entire day to cover the temple.Cons: Look too much money minded. free darshan will take 5+ hours where 250rs take less then 1 hour.All the gurukal asking money even to give prashadham which is very disappointing experience,Temple management ruining the quality of temple nature."
257,Wonderful,"First time visit to a temple after giving money....yes that's the irony. Still wondering where does this money goes as facility provided like washroom, keeping stuff were of poor quality. Last trip to any south india temple by giving money."
258,Biggest functional temple in the world.,It is one of 108 Divya desams of lord vishu.It is one of the most popular temple in Tamil Nadu. The lord vishu is in reclining  pose and raja gopuram is nice to see.
259,Well maintained Vishnu Temple !,"very quiet placeThe temple is impressive.No shoes , silence , no photos in the templeRespect the place."
260,Excellent Dravidian architecture,"We went for a long trip around Trichy and Madurai. Visited during afternoon.

Overall, the experience was really awesome with the‚Ä¶"
261,Nice temple,We reached there by 5am and got quick dharshan...by 6am quick was huge...we we're lucky to enter fast...
262,A must see pilgrimage destination,"One of the largest temples in India, a huge complex.  You need a guide to do it justice.  Fascinating place and well worth a visit."
263,Every Hindu and Vaishnavaite should visit this huge temple,Very very crowded place with loads of people. Not easy for senior people or parents with young kids.The waiting time can be upto five hours most often. Prepare for the wait!
264,Eternal Bliss,"Ranganathaswamy Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, is a must see when in Trichy or near by. Close to the bank of river Cauvery the temple has a huge complex flanked with Gopurams on all the sides. The rock cut sculptures, murals and the beautiful statues are just amazing. While‚Ä¶"
265,Nothing prepares you for the size of this temple. Truly heaven on earth.,"A part of my trip to Trichy, Kumbakonam and Nagipattinam took me to this venerable place. Across Kaveri river from Trichy and barely 12 kilometers away is this abode of peace and religiosity. This is not the first time I went to the Temple. This was a trip after 21 years. Solemnity  and grandeur of the place has only amazed me. What‚Äôs most striking is the cleanliness and orderliness around the temple and in the massive complex. Very unlike what we see in temples of rest of india, particularly north of Vindhyas.As you near the town, you are face to face with massive Gipueam, the main entrance which is almost a modern building of 10 to 12 stories high. Decked with statues in varied hues and divinity. And sheer hard granite. How they even managed to raise these massive stones so high back in days without any machines beats imagination. The next most impressive is the hall of 1000 pillars. Incredible to see these 1000 carved pillars of hard granite installed hundreds of years ago without machines or cranes. Simple and sheer human strength. A must visit to all pilgrims and tourists, irrespective of your religious or caste or community."
266,"Nice temple, but as usual Hindus dislike others","A huge Tempel with many different entrances and nice view points! It‚Äôs better to book a guide, Partha was an amazing guide :)!"
267,BE PREPARE WITH Rupees...,"Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple as also called  ""Thiruvarangam""  is a Hindu temple dedicated to Ranganatha, a reclining form of the Hindu deity Maha Vishnu.This is an ancient temple and very much big occupying an  area of about 155 acres . This is world's largest temple. It is located 12 Kms north from Trichy. There are more than 50 shrines in this temple complex. We can have darshan of Thayar Ranganayaki(Lakshmi) Garuda (very big one) Lord Dhanvantari Lord Narasimha Lord Rama Goddess Mahalakshmi Chakkarathalwar etc...At least we may require minimum  2 hours to worship the Gods and Goddesses of the Temple. This temple is always crowded, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. It is better to book on line darshan tickets of Rs.250 per person. By booking on Line, we can finish our Darshan within 30 minutes. We witness lot of VIP and VVIP devotees entering directly,  causing much trouble for the devotees waiting in the queue. Hope temple authorities may look into this and try minimising VIP VVIP tickets.It is a must to see this Ranganathaswamy temple when you are in Trichy."
268,Srirangam Temple,"Loved the fine details and colours on the temple steeples (?). Lots of character. Get a guide for Rs 100 per person only, well worth the payment as he will take you to places that are not normally open (rooftop terrace etc for the best views). Dress code applies (no exposed‚Ä¶"

272,Ranganathaswamy Temple @ Trichy,We went in the evening.  The temple was very busy.  They allowed motorcycles inside the entrances.  It was noisy and dangerous in walking in the complex.  A spiritual place ruined.
273,Temple Visit,We came in the morning and I found this temple stunning. Plenty of time to take amazing pictures. The towers are very beautiful and tall. You need about 1 hour here.

283,"RANGANATHA, THE CELESTIAL LOVER OF ANDAAL","Very very difficult in writing a review, for, it is to be experienced to understand the feel, and the vibration of the Almighty... One should visit at least once in their lifetime - such a vast area to cover all the prime GODs with single mind to achieve purpose of the life, true Hinduism reflects in each inch of the temple premises and each step you take inside the shrine. Surprising, how well it is maintained for such a huge place with high number of sincere devotees at any time - 365 days of the year, with good staying facilities, amenities, well connected by road, rail, and air, busy throughout the day...simply AMAZING LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT, I am awestruck."

288,A great India temple,"I went to the temple on 28.06.19 .The crowd was not much. It took hardly  one hour to complete all Sannadhi s and dharshan. Every Sannadhi, I was also going after VIP s and I was waiting for the Battery Car . Battery Car operator said he is waiting for VIP and it will take about 5 minutes. In the meantime he said I ll drop you and I ll come back forVIP. He dropped me upto Ranga Ranga gate. Thanks and in all sannadhi s I had a good and close sight of God. Very very happy about my trip to Srirangam."
289,Biggest Gopuram In India at Sri Ranganatha swamy temple.,"Catch the number 1 bus from the bus depot near Trichy Junction railway station to Srirangam and if you are fortunate you will chance upon one of the many spectacular ceremonies carried out in the temple grounds. If not, then the day to day activities and the surrounds will be‚Ä¶"
290,"Beautiful, wonderful...","This is one of the most impressing Temple I have ever been. Make sure you have at least four hours for a visit. This is very short time. For me, I could spend days in there."

292,Huge temple with four gates,"The SriRangam temple moved me beyond words. For a moment, I lost my bearing and envisioned myself in another era. The architecture in the temple is simply baffling as most carved from a single stone. One wonders how this could be possible hundreds of years ago with minimal technology. Every nook n cranny of the temple exudes history and a glimpse into a past civilisation. Simply unfanthomable.Om Namo Narayanaüôè"

296,Must visit ,The temple is a marvellous beauty of its own. But the price of the tickets are skyrocketing and there are 50 and 250 rupees tickets. The 250 rupees tickets allow you faster access to the deity but there was no justice made to the 50 rupees buyers.
297,Beautiful architecture ,"The temples were amazing, rising high into the air and bedecked with hundreds of carvings of the gods, coloured in subtle pastel shades. Well worth a visit."
298,Grand and gigantic place,We went there at 5:30AM. There was a crowd of a couple of hundred people before us. Took around 2 hours including waiting and darshan.
299,Expensive Darshan,"After nearly three months in South East Asia we're a bit ""templed out"" but the first impression is stunning. The site is clean and orderly.
