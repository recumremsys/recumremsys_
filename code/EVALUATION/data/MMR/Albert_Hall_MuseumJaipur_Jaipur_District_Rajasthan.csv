0,Good,Its a english time building beutifully crafted is now a museum. They have a 3000 year old mummy & many other things
1,Great,It's a British time museum. They have a mummy also. In evening it is illuminated with lights & looks amazing.
2,Albert Hall Museum,"The museum has a huge collection of ancient items. A must visit for the art lovers. They collection of anything and everything. From pottery, statue, painting, weapon, cloth, carpet and what not!!!!Its very well maintained one. Kids may not like it."
3,Excellent Museum- A Must Visit,"Its one of the best museum with best architecture building. A lot of there is in the museum related to history and everything, a history lover must visit it, also it has side which is famous for photography and feeding the pigeons. Pigeons, clouds, birds, sunset and sunrises make the place so beautiful. There is a garden also where you can walk play and hangout with friends and family."
4,Excellent museum,"We visited this museum as normal museum but it had a surprise for us. It is housed in a nice building with your usual museum stuff like clothes, arms, carpets, jewellery, books, coins etc. But the surprise was Egyptian mummy. In basement of building, there was Egyptian artifacts and we could see Egyptian mummy. I guess it was the only museum in India which has Egyptian mummy. So I and my son were delighted since wanted to see Egyptian mummy.Outside this museum there is yummy street food at Masala Chowk"
5,Superb Building and artifacts,"The museum has beautiful building storing items like carpets, clothes, utensils, weapons, etc. There is Egyptian mummy to our surprise at the basement. Photography is not prohibited. Lighting makes it more beautiful at night."
6,Great museum,"Located in heart of city , in an old building with excellent architecture. The exhibits are weapons, crockery, currency, paintings, Egyptian Mummy, brass handicrafts, marble carvings .. a unique antique collection .."
7,Spoiled by the pigeons...,"Albert Hall Museum is a very regular museum with weapons, pottery, ceramics, crystal ware, daily use items from olden days, statues, textile, paintings, coins from different eras. It has an Egyptian mummy too. The entire visit took about 1-2 hours. There was nothing spectacular about this museum. However, the museum lights up very beautifully after sunset. That pretty sight is a must see from Bapu Bazaar. It is visible from one of the gates there."
8,A good one,"It's good place to reach easily, i have taken  300rs ticket from the Alberto Museum itself, so v don't want to buy tickets for few other places under the archeological department,"
9,Beautifully lit up at night,"The museum has many nice collections of pottery, ceramics, textiles, weapons and many more of this region. The museum at night in varied colours is a treat to watch. Above all, this is unique for the collections from Egypt in a separate section at basement including the egypt mummy ..few thousand years old preserved here."
10,Couple of hours well spent amongst Maharaja class artefacts and collectibles,One of the best museum I have ever seen. It is having a mummy also there. It's a British time created museum.
11,The Well maintained museum,"The museum is based in an old building located in the heart of city. Historical weapons, crockery, clothing, art is on display. Main attraction is Mummy. Photography is not prohibited."
12,"Impressive, informative, too much repetition",Impressive building looking like a dove's cage. People selling food for the pigeons. This degrades completely the value of the exterior impression of this museum. I didn't enter.
13,Museum Visit,"A small museum. Artefacts, statutes, paintings and jewellery. It is a picturesque monument to be visited in evening ."
14,Looks majestic at night,This museum is probably the best of Rajasthan or at the very least Jaipur. There’s a rich collection of mainly Indian exhibits pretty much from the entirety of the history of the sub-continent. Though the star attraction seems to be a mummy from ancient EgyptWorth visiting in Jaipur
15,Interesting Building with nice history and exhibits,"This is one of the oldest museum in Rajasthan also known as  Government Central Museum . The building was designed by Sir Samuel S Jacob, assisted by Mir Tujumool Hoosein. It was opened for public  in 1887 .This museum has enormous collection includes folk arts, miniature paintings, textiles pottery, traditional costumes, marble carvings, coins , Mommy , musical instruments, ivory, and visual explanations of Indian culture and traditions. A must visit place . Photography is not restricted.If you are art and culture lover have sufficient time in hand and visit ."
16,Architectural wonder,All item inside cover with dust not maintained at all all very poor conditions you will not missed anything if you don’t go
17,One of the best,"We visited the museum in Jan 2020. It is centrally located in Jaipur, well connected by public transport. The building itself is ornamental and selfie buffs would love it.The museum galleries are well laid out in three spacious levels with magnificent display of metal craft, arms and armour, pottery, miniature paintings, jewellery, musical instruments, coins, carpets, ancient scriptures, and the most beautiful sculptures in metal and stone of Hindu Gods and Godesses from 8th century onwards, with exquisite ornamental crowns, subtle smile & features. Other sculptures include Bodhisatva, Yakshi, Chaturbhuji Vishnu, Vaman Vishnu, Mahishasur Mardini, etc, which make every Indian swell with pride. The gallery is home to an Egyptian Mummy of the Ptolemaic Era and certain facts and details about various mummies found in Egypt. It was an overall treat to view and capture the art on display.A must visit place in Jaipur.Family loved it. A delight for your visual senses."
18,An average experience,"Albert Hall Museum is one of the Jaipur's best kept secrets and a place worth visiting. It is wrong. Musuem has great collection of thnigs to see, even an Egyptian mummy. It took us 1 hour to visit the whole musuem, but one can stay there much longer."
19,The Museum with the egyptian mummy,It needs some maintenance. It is not clean . The only thing that I liked was mummies except that it is waste of time .
20,Not so good,the museum is situated at the heart of the city and very well maintained and managed by museum authorities. there are multiple galleries available which you can visit.
21,Needs better maintenance,"Albert hall museum is not included in city tour. It is shown from outside however I thought of exploring it and I am glad that I visited this place. It has everything from carpets, paintings, pottery, idols, metal objects, weapons etc. I have visited many places in the city. I would rate this the best. It is easy to reach too. Please visit Albert hall museum. The architecture of the hall is also good."
22,A comical museum experience,"This museum dates from the late nineteenth century. It's therefore following the era that saw the foundation of the great European museums, undoubtedly the model for that product of modernity: ie the practice of ​​gathering in a building and opening to the public the highest evidences of culture, coming from near or far territories .However the second half of the nineteenth century is also the period (in the wake of the Universal exhibition in London, 1851) in which space is also given in museums to the phenomenon of the so-called ""Industrial Arts"" (German ""Kunstgewerbe"", French ""Arts décoratifs"", Italian ""Arti applicate""), that is, the arts producing artifacts not only for contemplation but also for everyday use.This museum in Jaipur reflects this cultural atmosphere. Alongside sublime and traditional works of art (I mention only the gallery of ancient Indian sculptures, or the famous ""carpet of the Persian garden""), there are ample collections of objects of practical - or ""even practical"" - use: like music instruments, jewels, furniture, weapons, etc.If the collection can appear ""chaotic"" to an inexperienced eye, keep in mind the idea underlying this museum, I mentioned above; and you will find (as I found) that this museum doesn't fear confrontation with the major art museums of the greatest Indian cities (in this trip we have seen those in Delhi and Kolkata)."
23,Lively museum ,Although we didn't get chance to visit the museum we did view the outside at night.It is lit up using changing colours and looks very impressive.
24,More dust inside than outside,"A lovely museum in the centre of Jaipur with a wide variety of Indian and other objects to see. You have to follow a specific route, but lots to see and well worth visiting."
25,"Albert Hall Museum - Jaipur , India - Rich collection of Rajasthani culture.","They charge Rs.40 per head for visit. But there is nothing great to see except the mummy. Carpet, weapons, crockeries, uniform etc are found in all the museum. Photography is allowed. Open garden is there outside."
26,I would visit again,We  visited this museum and its really good. I was impressed with the collection of historical artifacts.
27,Worth visiting in Jaipur,"Albert Hall Museum is an excellent museum with wonderful exhibits from all over the world. The ancient Indian sculptures, artefacts, carpets, textiles, texts, paintings etc are quite impressive and one can while away many hours at the museum. We could only spend an hour or so at the museum, but to do it true justice, you need to browse slowly."
28,Museum and sightseeing,"The museum houses a number of important items all segregated and placed categorically. Lots of work on textiles, artillery, arts, music and culture are available for display.The architecture of the building is itself a sight to behold. A light show is displayed in the evening that can be viewed from the streets."
29,Hoard of artifacts around the world!,This was a pleasant surprise quickly qualified into a must do in JaipurOne of the best museums I visited so far. The collections are really good and the place is maintained spotlessDo visit in the evening. They close at 5:00 and reopen again with fancy lighting at 6:30 pm. The tickets are slightly expensive in the evening (100 rupees per head compared to 40 in the morning) but they place had few visitors in the evening and much more peaceful
30,Excellent Museum in a grand building,An architecture to be admired. Light show in evening is very attractive. Easy access. Ample road side parking available. Must visit
31,Indian and International Culture,"We toured here for about 90 mins. today and were impressed with the collection of historical artifacts.  Also, I was equally impressed with the architecture of the museum itself which displayed an impressive style reminiscent of the Moor architecture of Spain and Northern Africa.  Museums are really my thing unless I have a tour guide which we decided not to do.  However, despite the large crowds visiting we felt we got a good taste of the items displayed and the history of the time period in only 90 mins."
32,Interesting museum,"The lighting at night was amazing, it was continuously changing colours. In the morning one can get inside but we were not able to manage time for that"
33,Amazing,We passed the museum a few times going from our hotel (Marriott) to the Amer/Amber Fort.  The architecture looked fascinating from the outside so we visited it.  Mid-February was a great time to visit Jaipur because it's near the end of the tourist season but hasn't really warmed up.  The museum has artifacts of all sorts.  From clay models of people at work (really fascinating) to clothes and manuscripts and paintings.  Without having to deal with jostling crowd we spent a pleasant two hours at the museum.
34,Nice architecture,"An interesting architecture, this building was designed to showcase a variety of arts from India,and comparative exemples from some parts of the world.The textile section had  lights in the display cases but they were not switched on! The rest was poorly lit too,and generally badly lit.Nonetheless it is still a cultural gathering of potteries, bronzes, Mughal miniatures, musical instruments etc...Worth to spend an hour away from traffic."
35,Beautiful illumination at night,"I visited Albert Hall museum on a day tour of Jaipur with Royal Majestic Tours. The tour guide, Mukesh was excellent, friendly and very knowledgeable. He pointed out the interesting exhibits in the museum as we walked through all of the rooms. The architecture of the building is also very impressive."
36,Albert hall museum….Egyptian mummy in Jaipur,"What a collection of artefacts! Great architecture. There's a mummy too. Overall a great experience Only if it can be maintained a bit cleaner, so much of dust  accumulating. And a board of ' silence' in each room required. There are police in every room, our people also should be more polite and responsible!"
37,Nice place and worth it if you have time in Jaipur,"Family of four, arrived after a long morning of seeing other sites. Being tired, it was difficult to pay 700 rupees (about $9.75USD) each to enter. Then, we found out that it would be an additional 10 Euros (about $11USD) each to go further inside where the King's area was. Pretty expensive for India. Don't go when you're tired, and you'll probably have a great experience."
38,Non- visit because of wrong advice!,"The museum is unique in terms of its historic architecture and houses collections from all over the world, especially an Egyptian Mummy!"
39,Interesting museum ,"The building itself and the surrounding garden are nice to look at and enjoy, the inside has a very generous architecture and contains lots of exhibits about Indian and Jaipur history and tradition, the arts and the religion with a lot of explanations. But my recommendation would be not to loose yourself in the details which can easily happen as they are believing that repetition is the mother of all learning."
40,Don't go when you're tired,"Trip Advisor can give out the wrong advice! The Albert Hall Museum is closed Tuesday's NOT Fridays'! Very annoying as we  checked before going and changed plans, now won't have a chance to visit"
41,Museum that doesn't fear comparison with the major art museums of the greatest Indian cities,Great history but include this in one of your guided tours !Well worth the visit and I’d rate it a 8/10
42,Albert Hall Museum,"I belongs to Jaipur and have visited this place multiple times. It never disappoints me. This time I visited Museum with kids. They were excited to see historical artifacts like guns, shields, swords used in 18th century. Well preserved beautiful potteries . Every artifact is well documented and provide you a context in which these things were used or developed. Main attraction is the mummy located in the basement of the muesuem."
43,a nice museum,We couldn't get inside this museum as it was closed by the time we reached there. so we took some photos outside the museum. It looks magnificent from outside and I am sure it the same in the inside too.
44,Fine display of historical artifacts,"An interesting building of its time, and a fascinating collection of artefacts, modelled on the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The Egpytian mummy gets a lots of interest. Some of the early coinage is interesting, together with various ceramics and textiles."
45,The lighting at night,I was bit late for the entry as I kept this in the end and by then visiting hours was over. But the building which looks majestic palace like structure gets even better with the colourful lights being focused to illuminate and its worth visiting to see the museum at night.
46,"By the time we reached there, it was closed!!!",We popped in for a couple of hours and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the exhibits and the really nice building. Its well organised and you can walk around it in a couple of hours.Worth the time if you can spare it
47,Wow collections,We landed at the site accidentally - our driver took us to the Coffee Day on the premises as we were craving our morning fix. Did not go inside the museum as it had not been on our agenda but drove by there a couple of time. It looks majestic at night - all lit up! This was a day before Republic day so the building was beautifully swathed in the colours of the Indian flag.
48,Marvellous!!!,We left our visit a little late and had to rush a bit. There was so much to see - we like museums - and we had to miss out on several sections that would have been interesting.Not quite sure why the Egypt section was there but I suppose it demonstrates the Victorian fascination.I found it very illuminating on all the periods of Indian history and well worth the visit
49,Educational museum,"The man at the ticket counter handed me a student ticket instead of a standard ticket. It was by pure chance that I noticed the discrepancy between the amount he charged and the receipt he handed over. The guards seem to all be in the game, as I have never been to another museum where they’ve checked the ticket so carefully. This was probably the most interesting “exhibit” in the museum.Rather stupidly, there are no toilets inside, so if you need a toilet you have to go through all the remaining rooms and the exit and go some distance further. (Don’t mention disabled access). The exit turnstile does not allow re-entry; the entry is on the other side of the building to the exit; the ticket is of course one use only. Luckily, there is not much inside worth seeing anyway.  In a country where 250 rupees buys you 45 GB of 4G data, 300 rupees apparently gets you access to a few glass cabinets with old carpets inside and a mummy.Two stars for the gorgeous exterior and some interesting cultural incidentals: a school group was performing on the front steps, a couple were taking pre-wedding photos with the building as a backdrop."
