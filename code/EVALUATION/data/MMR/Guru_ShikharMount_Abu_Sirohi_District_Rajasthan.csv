0,no any washrooms or toilets,"do not visit , there is no any washrooms or toilets again.... do not visit , there is no any washrooms or toilets , after paying heavy entry fees looted by them"
1,Scenic beauty,At dizzying heights...Great place to take photographs.....Gets very crowded during holidays....Hire a bike to visit...
2,Beautiful photo shoot spot and meditation point,Not very far from mount abu ..best way is to hire 2 wheelers ...great drive. Pure environment.. u have to climb a few steps to reach the top..there is a dattariya temple also just below the top..great views..must go..windy most of the time.
3,Nice place at Height. Beauty lies at top here!,"Good view of mountains in the way .. less greenray,more rocks .. one has to climb on foot to reach the top .. no approach road upto top... Dattatreya mandir in the middle is very peaceful.. veiw from top is astonishing."
4,Seemed like the top of the world !,A normal temple visit with some 100-150 stairs ...a good steep walk   Place should be visited as one of the key locations and temple of the town 
5,Highest Point in Rajasthan,"top of the town.... cloudy atmosphere with sweetcorn....snake shaped roads...very nice view for photography,,, we enjoyed a lot..."
6,Gurushikhar,area where there isn't any self guidance provided or nothing much to view.  Hyped up lot so not worth a visit. still if want to explore the height and surroundings there may 
7,A good exercise and good view,yes this is on the top side .. so if you are visiting abu you better explore this too. All this is incredible india . if you are visiting 1st time to abu then you will like to watch  
8,Hike and enjoy view ,"The surrounding is dirty and is  full of litter, the moment you arrive there  you will get hounded by guides and people offering to carry you up to the temple.. They said its 700 steps.. Temple itself is nice but the surrounding area is bad.. "
9,Nice place ,A prfct sunrise if you manage to wake up early in the morning...a place not very crowded where you can enjoy the natural beauty...clouds moving around you Loved this place
10,Did not find it exciting ,At a very stiff height..One must be an expert driver if you are driving your own car ..Cool breezes welcomes you and the whole Mount Abu city is visible from there..
11,Highest Point in Mount Abu,Beautiful and Peaceful.Only thing lacking is there is no clean and proper washroom near this place.
12,"Peaceful, scenic, holy spot - Highest peak in the Aravalis!",Must visit place. Signature of Mount Abu. No need of any palki or anything else if you can climb some stairs. Its not much as told by the palki people.
13,Height ,they cheat you at the parking for taking old people and childrens up saying there are 500 steps which is not true. there are quite few steps but manageble. people who cannot climb can sit and wait at restaurants below. nothing to be missed on the top. the place is not managed…
14,ARAVALI MOUNTAIN,"This is the Highest point in Mount Abu. Never Miss this. Visit specially in Winters. Rent a Bullet and visit, It would great experience."
15,Quality time spend with friends ,"This is one place you should visit when you go to Mount Abu, as the place is beautiful and should not be missed"
16,Very good,"Hi All, If you are at mount abu, start your trip with guru shikar around 15km, it's one of the highest peak of mountains, the guru shikar is famous spiritual place. from the top of the hill you seen nature's beauty."
17,Excellent Views,it's a wonder to be on top of Guru Shikhar...looks gr8 from top..u can feel the clouds touching in winter...amazing experience...!!!
18,Excellent place to visit while you are in Abu,We visited there just 2 days back. We would recommend go by bike or scooty.. u get it on rent like goa. U will enjoy the amazing view n drive if ur going with ur partner.
19,The top of Aravalli range.,"beware of guides who are cheats. there is nothing much to see in this place except for nice aerial city view, for which you really do not need any guide. in general you will find cheats in mount abu and specially in guru shikhar."
20,Great Experience,"It is on the hill top, Can go by taxi, Scooter, Bike < Trekking Type Experience , Ride Scooter for around 20 KMS and then Stairs around 100"
21,Nice nature drive,Be ready to climb up quite a few stairs if you want to go there but you wont regret it.  the highest point of Aravalis is worth a visit.  
22,Beautiful place,Good place to visit ... ancient place of worship for Guru Dattatreya. You can experience peace & tranquillity here... gives a good view of Mount Abu and the beautiful lakes around. People with severe leg pain and arthritis will find it difficult to reach the top.
23,Holly place,It's not the ideal place for person who often go to hill stations you will not find anything interesting here. In fact there is nothing interesting.high problem of parking congested road only traffic and not even a single restaurant or good eating point where you can sit and have some thing to eat when with family. Only few vendors selling boiled corn .. at all not good place for people who had travelled to other hill stations like shimla manali or Jammu .....
24,Best views,Totally Avoidable unless your agenda is to visit the small temple at the top .. the way up is surrounded by small vendors so no beauty there and nothing very special at the top also
25,Visit for Great Views,Its further above Mt Abu - around 25 kms more and 1000 feet higher ... good drive with green rocky Aravlis Hills.... a typical Monument of Lord Shiva 
26,Nice views,It is the highest point where you have to climb the stairs which I counted to be 256 on one side. A must visit in Mount Abu
27,Guru Shikhar ,Good place to visit. At height. Need to climb about 500 plus steps to reach. Good scenic beauty. Amazing scenes of natural beauty. Will see clouds going below from the top.
28,Family visit,"Highest peak of Mt Abu...On top there is temple of God Dattatraya...Enjoy the journey...Nothing much to do, except taking selfies and drinking chhas on the way."
29,At an elevation of about 3000 ft – “Shikhar”!! Must Visit,"We rented a bike in mount about and we travel from Mount abu to Guru Shikhar, its not so far fbut the drive was really wonderful and the place is also beautiful."
30,Amazing,"We went there with family. At the peak there is a temple that one can go to. It is good 700-800 steps up the hill. During January month the views are more or less the same through the climb. Hence, we would advise one to go up to Lover's point which is about 1.5 kms below the temple point. The observatory had better views but they have stopped tourists to go beyond a certain point. You can instead go to Achalgarh Jain temple on the opposite mountain to get the valley views. If you reach the top of the highest temple there then you can get to see a majestic sunset as well."
31,Shikhar,"This  is around 15-18 kms from Mount Abu Bus Stand and  I would recommend to travel by your own vehicle. You will really be amazed and feel pleasant while travelling on roads climbing the mountain and seeing the world around  us getting smaller. The temple is at the top of Mountain so when you reach there you will really enjoy cool winds, top mountain view and Guru's Darshan. Outside the temple you can click some great photos with mountain and height view. Again while going down from the mountain by roads will be an amazing journey with bike. I recommend to start early in the morning as in afternoon there will be hot sun on the head and it will become a tiring journey."
32,Guru Shikhar,It is exciting place to visit those who love adventure.... the top view from guru shikhar is fabulous and feels on top of world. 
33,Good views and nice journey,"If you are in Mount Abu, this is a place not to be missed. The ride to the hilltop is exciting, especially on a bike or activa. Time your visit well, so that you can enjoy the sunset from here. We enjoyed the ride the view, though it was quite cold and tiring by the time we got…"
34,Highest point in Rajasthan,Scenic place with lots of places to photograph. A travellers paradise is Mt Abu. Surely worth a visit !!!
35,Highest point of Aravali range,A nice place to visit approx 100-150 steps if it is a cloudy weather then clouds will be beneath you and you will feel great. While climbing it wil definately will make you a bit tired.
36,One of the highest point of mount abu,"If you are in Abu and you don't give this place a visit, you have committed a big mistake.  It is a must visit place for nature lovers. Take your car along if you love to ride and you feel comfortable on hilly roads.  You will love the view from here. It is the highest point of…"

45,Touching the sky,The road leading to Gurusikhar is very very adventurous and hence it is worth a visit ! The walk up the hill is very soothing as the weather is little chilly.
46,Highest point of Mt Abu,"it gives a beautiful view. we can ride upto a point and need to trek a bit..but the trekking is not that tough as good stairs and railings are there..lots of fruits and lemon soda, buttermilk and cute stalls are there on the way.. at the point of the guru shikhar there is a…"
47,Highest Point to enjoy view,This is the highest point of the aravallis. Have to climb lots of stairs. Not for elderly. Palkis are available and charge 780 per head. Lots of small shops on the way. Every item is priced steeply. Two temples are on the way. Good views from the top

51,Amazing views from the top,"The highest point of the Aravalli mountain range ..obviously the walk up the hill is bit strenous and enjoyable if you like the the strech and strain. The temple above of the great guru,Dattatraya  is a small and peaceful place and nearby we can sit at rest for some time before…"
52,hyped,"This is quite far from the city area. Not sure how much private vehicle charges. Try to come with own vehicle, driving to this point is fun. Great roads and great views. Must go to the top of mountain you see great views. "
53,Fsmily trip,It's a place 20km away from main Abu. But worth the trouble. Beautiful scenery. Must go for first time visitors.

59,One of highest point in India,"Mount Abu and guru shikhar are not that big hill station.  One need to follow usual hill rules while driving, which means no cutting lanes. Rest is good.  I visited in July 17,  was disappointed as  it was cloudy and no visibility,  bit overcrowded,  wind was awesome after twice…"
60,AT THE TOP OF MOUNT ABU,"This Deity Datta Shrine needs strong knees to climb ! The elderly have the option of coolies carrying you in a 'jhoola'. What is most striking other than its spiritual value, is the vast panoramic scenery around you. Spend atleast an hour at the top. Reach before 4 pm."
61,Good place to go,"Nice views from the top , a temple about Dattaray, Very well managed . If you are with old folks avoid it as you need to climb a lot of stairs to reach there . All in all the drive to temple is nice."
62,Peak of Aravalli hills,Perhaps the best place of mount abu. The view from the hill is fascinating. Not much to climb. But like most of the places in Mount Abu its too crowded.
63,Awesome feeling!,"We visited this place in Oct 2017 as part of our group tour. We had hired autos and went in groups of 4 each. The ghat climb is quite steep at places with hairpin bends. But the weather was pleasant throughout and we did not feel any exertion.  After reaching the place, midway…"
64,Best place to visit in Mount Abu,Highest peak in Mount Abu they say. And yes it is the highest peak. Spectacular view from all the sides once you reach at the top.

65,good temple but the journey till there was best,This is an interesting place to visit. U can drive to the base of this place and then have to climb stairs reach to the top. There  are two temples one mid way and one at the top of the mountain. For senior citizen n people who cannot climb stairs there is an option of…
66,Tallest Top,"You need to climb around 400 steps. Car will go only to certain distance. Climbing all the way up to the top, where Guru Padukas are kept is a good experience. Climbing is not very difficult for average healthy person. Carriers (Dolis) are also available"

Is it worth the travel? The travel to this place is better than the place itself - if you ask me. The road is…"
70,This time Its much more beautiful - Rainy season is awesome at Guru Shikhar,"not very amazed with it. Hundreds of stairs to climb, making it inaccessible for old. there are better views elsewhere."
71,Avoidable ,"the tallest peak as it is of the range, the way to it is ts self beautiful.. after reaching ther you can have a really relaxing time in the chilled environment. it really offers gret view"

82,Breathtaking view from top of mountain.,"It is an easy climb to Guru Shikhar. Nice all round views, especially of the near by observatory. Avoid noons."
83,Ok place ,"Sweat it out and see the temple and the view of the town. Get a guide to know the history, and let some local folks earn the 100-200rs which otherwise you'd spend on a beer or coffee in the city.   Refresh yourself with some tea and snacks post the descent. And be ready to hear…"
84,Most Famous in Abu,There are good views from the top - apart from that there isn't anything else. Considering the number of steps one has to climb - it is a huge disappointment once you reach the top. Obviously entire way up is highly commercialised.
85,Highest peak,what a view and fresh air touching your soul wish to visit every day and do try red muli on the go with some salt the best thing to have while climbing and the big bell is awesome 
86,Best View,"1. Its a place of lord guru datta incarnation of vishnu god you ll enjoy a lot there you ll get rudraksh beats for very less price sold by temple trust. 2.

91,At 5200 feet hight nice views,This part contains a small temple of Lords Shiva/ Brahma/Vishnu. Nice place. I would like to go this place again.
92,Awesome place,"Guru shikar is a nice serene and lonely place , drive just away from temple on the road to observatory and enjoy scenic beauty of forest and hills u can observe bears roaming around freely. The games of clouds with hilltops and breeze of hills. Sit on any stone and meditation for hours, different sheds of blue mountain lines to greener sheds of forest with rock spots.Drive to mount abu Nakki lake is too crowded and tod rock loose it's attraction ,go beyond nakki lake to honeymoon point ,small road leads to most attractive pointHoneymoon point is last point of hill range and best to enjoy sunset. Must visit at sunset time"
93,Highest place of aravli hills,Good place to go to if you are in Mount Abu. The highest point in the Aravalli range this place offers a good look out to the surrounding areas. The mountain air might make you pant but it is not at all difficult. Slow and steady should have you up there.  The worst part is the…
94,Definitely visit this place,This is the highest point in Mt Abu and view from top is really nice. You need to climb around 100-150 steps to reach at the top but you will feel good once you reach there.  Must visit when in Mt Abu
95,Height of pleasure,it is a place where Dattatreya bhagwan meditated..There are 150 steps for reaching the temple. The panoramic view  of Mount Abu from the top makes the climb worthwhile..
96,Mr Cyril mendonca.,The Gurushikhar view point gives you some wonderful views of the valley  . A must visit if you are planning your Mt Abu trip. The story behind the temple there is fascinating . We enjoy the little trek up to the top. Might be a little daunting for people with very small children.
97,Beautiful place to be... ,Now this is the place i looking for in mount abu. very nice sight view at the top of the hill. you can go there by two ways one is from stairs and second is by rope. sunset and sunrise both looking very good from the top.
98,HIGHEST POINT,This is a best place to see the sun set. Good view of the city and lake. Come here again sour. Highly recommended.....
99,Monsoon special view,Apparently the highest/tallest geological point in the state. Offers some decent views - views would be better if the surrounding hills were green. Has a couple of temples for the religiously inclined. 
100,Top of the hill - beautiful,"Superb view, just 15 kms away from mount abu city, hire a cab, or hire a activa for 300/day and visit there with family and friends "
101,Peak of Aravali range,This is a really magical place; the view is absolutely fantastic and we loved to meditate at the top - what a great experience !
102,highest point on Mount Abu,"It's like a top of mount abut, best view from top. having more than 100 stairs to climb so be ready for some exercise... also roads are bit curvy so be careful while driving...   best time to reach will be bit early morning.."
103,Height of 5300 feet,"The view is definitely worth the drive and climb!The difficult part is maneuvering through the traffic , crowd and heat if you are visiting in the summers.Unruly traffic is such a big put off! Could be managed better."
104,Main attraction of mount abu,It is a place to worship and pleasant atmosphere uphill. However the place misses basic amenities like toilet. Rest it's fine.
105,Highest view of Mountabu ,"Its on the top, best time is to go in the evening and wait till dark. The stars in the sky look so beautiful.Be careful the drive to top is bit dangerous"
106,"Small template at top of mountain, scenic view","I went with family. It is about 15 kms from mount abu. One can go there by his/her own vehicle or by cab. You will have to climb 200 stairs approx. But if weather is fine, its totally worth it. There is one temple of Anasuya in way & temple of Guru Dattatreya on top. We went…"
107,Amazing View,We visited this place and involves few stair climbing to reach to temple at the top. There r people to carry u to the top in case of old. U do see a good view of city and mountains
108,Scenic drive,I am in love with this place since visited. That's the most I can describe its raw beauty and altitude of the place is just awesome.
109,Best Place,"Wonderful visit to this place before couple of days left me spellbound, it's so nice that by going there once only you can realize - Really Really an amazing place - I am not aware of the history of the place but must visit once in Mount Abu. In fact there is nothing much to see…"
110,Combine with Dilwara,"It is a beautiful and amazing religious place. You have to climb almost 300+ steps to reach to the temple. Once you are on top of the temple, you can get a 360 degree view - it is just wow"
111,Must visit place (Car recommended) ,This place is holy place and extremely beautiful.But visit it in morning because it gets very crowded after that.
112,Good but unorganised,"This is the highest point in Mount Abu and Rajasthan too. The day we went it's bright and sunny with nice breeze. You can stay there for around 2hr or so including the temples on the top. Around 250 steps, so would be a bit difficult for elderly."
113,High Peak Point- Religious Value- But Poorly managed,Only best said is to experience this place. Our visit was in November and time was noon.  While the place offers a exhilarating experience even the drive ups your nerves and more aped for bike riders.   The temple is on a hill and darshan and after the darshan visit samll places…
114,Quite left out !,Further down the same road beyond Dilwara. Makes sense to combine the two if you are staying in town.
115,one of the major sightseeing in mount abu,"must place to visit at mount abu, good view from the top of temple and good shops on bith sides of path "
116,Highest peak,nice to climb the highest point of aravalli. good vies of all the plians from the hilltop. also the temple of shiva was a highlight.
117,Shoddy Parking,"We went there by our own car and struggled to find a parking space. However, we did get couple of guys to find a place and also get the car washed. Once parked, had to take a flight of stairs to reach the place. Not much if the place is cool else you might find it difficult due…"
118,Beautiful sunset view,"Need to climb 300 steps to go to top mandir , doli available , charge is ~ 500 rs per person , service is good "
119,Highest peak but nothing great.,"The most coveted place in Mt Abu we were very excited after hearing so much about itand we were not disappointed.  As we climbed mild showers started and it was lush green everywhere The peak offered spectacular views amidst the mist. Boiled corn, fruits & masala maggi is what u can devour on the way and on the top. Definitely worth the time and effort Also a good place to collect souvenirs or gifts if you intend to buy them"
120,A must visit place,Gurushikhar is only the highest peak of Mount Abu. If you plan by going as couples. i would reccoment to take a bike trip from mount abu. AS you will enjoy the bike  ride to gurusikhar.  There is more than 5000 steps you have to get by walk to reach the temple at top... be ready…

123,Nice Place,"This place called Guru Shikhar must be visited while you are in Abu, This is located on higher altitude of 1722 meters, you can drive directly to that place by Car and 2 wheeler. Bus could not be taken. After the parking there are around some 300 ladders to be climbed. Palkhi…"
124,Nice view from top,"Majestic view from the top of this climb, apart from the religious angle. Also quite a few Viewpoints on the way to Gurushikar"
125,seeing is believing,There is an ISRO observatory tucked away close to Guru Shikhar. Makes for an excellent twilight drive and just gazing at the stark landscape from a height. A must visit in Mount Abu.
126,The peak of the guru,Good location to visit we drove there in our car during Diwali vacation so there was a lot of traffic on the way. Near the dilwara Jain temple the road is very bad but otherwise it is a good road. Worth a visit
127,High & high,A Great VIew from the Top. A breath taking experience to watch the excellent view. Beautifully maintained.
128,Top of Western India,The place takes about 30 to 45 minutes by car. You have to struggle for parking as it has limited place for parking and there is no agency to manage it. It is free for all and you know how we mismanage and outsmart each other in such situations !  You have to climb the steps to…
129,Nice view from top,"It is the top most point in mount Abu and it did not disappoint. However, I would urge the authorities to clean the place the up. It is in really bad shape. The road is very scenic but dirty. The trek (stepped) is also very dirty. Once you reach the top, the view will not disappoint you."
130,Top of the places of Mount Abu,Its a tough walk uphill for elderly people though there is a facility of being carried on PALKI. Views are great. Enjoy the cool breeze when you are uphill.
131,Over crowded but has good view of entire Mt Abu,"Gurushikhar is a good hilly terrain for people opting mountaineering or trekking , a temple visit at peak of hills , good trekking way , soothing climate, breeze of fresh air will blow your mind here . It’s really fun here if your visit with friends"

133,Top of Mount Abu!!,This is on top of hill and you need to climb stairs to reach to highlight point. Lot of shops for food etc on way when you climb. There is a temple also after you climb a bit. Visit early in morning as day time it could be hot. 
134,Nice place ,"Guru Shikhar is one of the most popular places in Mount abu which is not to be missed. Not only it provides a terrific view of the entire city,  it is also a place to worship and whether or not you are religious,  you will love worship here. This place requires some climbing…"
