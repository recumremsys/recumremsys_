0,Great ski holiday every time,Great resorts around then region. Prefer Sauze to the othersLifts a little old but skiing is great Can lack snow early and late season so for me it would be Christmas to mid March. we sell lots of late deals for March once we know the snow will be aceLots off reed runs which i love. good groomed pistes - great for my dodgy knee
1,"Great area, especially mid-mountain","Well connected  wit numerous ski lift, one ski pass gives you oportunity to ski 4 different mountains.Loved it. Most likely will return again in near future."
2,Via Lattea - ski system really bad,"Has some great runs lots of varied runs, beware when skiing into sestriere , get the gondola at the top or  halfway down the run to the village as it is a bit of a hike when you get to the bottom , once in sestriere there are some really good runs to ski."
3,Pleasant skiing trip in Via Lattea,"very good areas , very nice runs  however it could do with some lifts improvement. Some lifts are ancient, slow . restaurants are decent priced ."
4,Poor snow and very icy,Massive ski area with great conditions - Lifts could be a bit faster! and easier to get to the other areas other than that its great!
5,the main concern is the wind,Good runs in sauz mainly aimed for intermediates and above. Excellent ski school who are very knowledgeable. Able to ski to other resorts in the milky way.
6,"Narrow slopes, rude service",Good ski area but disappointed that if staying in Sauze d'oulx and you want to ski the Milky way area you can only come back via a black run as blue and red runs to the village are closed because if young Italian girls death and on going police investigations. Crystal would not allow us to change resort. So disappointed with that as if limits the ski area if you are not comfortable doing black.
7,In need of investment,The skiing is varied and generally very good. I shall return again next year have been  four times been other ski areas but this suits me best. As a intermidiate skier and a partner who does not ski this area is great .
8,Sunny side of the Alps,"Nice ski resort with lots of areas to ski and good links to other resorts.Skiing is good but nothing very difficult, apart from a couple of blacks the resort is  good intermediate area with lots of cruising slopes.There is good snow making which is useful as when we were there there wasn't much snow."
9,"Closed lifts,","Good holiday ,great ski area with mix of high open areas and many tree lined runs.Altitude  gives snow sure conditions. Italian food is great  .uncrowded  pistes  with no lift queues. Links to other villages always open. Went back five times over the years and never disappointed. Will be back in a few years."
10,Sun and snow,"Not a great ski resort but does link to others, no good for beginners so choose carefully?  Some good restaurant though"
11,"Nice runs, old lift system with poor connections ","Nice ski area, with many well groomed ski slopes. In January there was few people, which left good room for skiing on the many wide slopes. There is easy access to lifts from Sauze d'Oulx, The part in relations to Sauze d'Oulx was most of my likings, with the most restaurants and slopes in the woods. Although, the Olympic slopes in Sestriere are nice, the area does not have the same charm as Sauze d'Oulx."
12,Skiing en masse,Great ski location but..... links can be closed due to wind which is fine from safety but I also think they shut lifts and runs unnecessarily to cut costs
13,Large ski area,Sauze has suffered with lack of snow.Many icy dangerous areas.Best area is over to Sansicario or to the bowl in Sauze.
14,"Great ski area, basic lift system and big queues during holiday times","This is a great place for intermediate skiers. There are many red pistes and the black ones aren’t as steep and challenging as other places. The downside is that the ski lifts are slow and outdated— almost all are chairlifts without covering. Also, the food wasn’t so good in the lodges on the slopes— mostly pre-made sandwiches. To add Montgenèvre, you can either get a 1 or 6 day pass. We got the 1 day pass and spent the whole day there. It was worth the extra €20 for the pass."
15,45 minutes to get up the slopes ,"Liked the amount of varied skiing that was available but the slow 2 man chair link to Sestriere needs improving. Very good for intermediates, not particularly good for beginners or advanced skiers"
16,Great resort but can get busy,"The resort is huge with five different mountains, some trails 10Km+ long. we were lucky to catch some natural snow this year and it's fantastic. Only complain for an Asian traveler is the food selection, eating Pizza and Panini for a week was a bit too much"
17,With Xmas on the Slopes,"Big area with great skiing. Sauze is great for intermediates and up but not to be recommended for beginners, Mongenervre or Sestrier better bet.Be careful to check list times if you travel widely and the link between sauze / sestrier / san secario is prone to closure with high winds"
18,First time skiing,Lots of intermediate skiing lifts prone to closure due to wind. Ski school fun instructor took the group around the area and we all enjoyed the race on Friday .
19,When in trouble,500k of great skiing so much to see and do the Olympic runs in sest are great fun but are steep at the top when icy are quite difficult
20,GREAT AREA,"Recent holiday came here with our guide, good snow and lots of runs with mixed ability for experienced and inexperienced skiers. Overall recommended."
21,Skiing,"Reasonable local ski area and the linked resorts for full area, BUT the linking between them can be a bit of a problem - especially if high winds close lifts. One might be limited to Sauze D'Oulx ski area only. Lift system is a bit slow / old in places."
22,Beware!!,Liked the people lovely and friendly and very good value although definately not a begginner ski resort or even less experienced intermediates quite steep slopes.
23,Good intermediate area,Huge terrain with amazing snow and infrastructureWorth the trip as it is also slightly cheaper than most of the other resorts that offer the same terrain
24,What's happenned?,"Shhhh! its fantastic. Good in the trees skiing, great mountain restarants. Good value. Most of all really nice people."
25,Good for intermediate skiiers,"Nice resort, good skiing, old liftsystem, Actually perfect snow condition during our stay.Family friendly slopes. Nice afterski"
26,Very slow old lifts,"Fantastic Ski Area for beginners and advanced skiers, Sportina area for food is very reasonable for a Ski resort , a lot cheaper than France and Austria"
27,Slow outdated lift system,Great variety of pistes and resorts.  many slopes easier then graded.  It is always possible to find something to match ability and ambition.
28,Stranded ,Great guaranteed snow.  Would recommend it for intermediates - novices/beginners its very challenging.  Lots of ski runs.  Piste map should be clearer as you often find yourself on a run that you did not want to do.
29,outdated lift system shut at the drop of a hat!,This area is great for intermediates. Lots of tree lined slopes. Piste map ok but markings on piste not great. If you want to go to Montegenevre go on a clear day as it does take a long time to get there and back and lifts close at 4.30 on the dot!
30,Italian con job,Great ski area plenty of runs well maintained they did well to keep all runs open with minimum snow everyone so friendly & helpful
31,Bored now,"220 km of piste in 4 resorts? Yes please.Scenary was beautiful, piste was perfectly groomed in the morning, but got icy in the afternoon.Picked this ski resort for the very convenient transfer from Torino.What was not that great: poor signaling of the pistes. Not only the domain is very vast, but gliding down a red slope you could easily find yourself on a black one with no option but to ski for dear life. Not great for safety. Also, a lot of exposed areas...nothing to prevent a fall off the mountain. Furthermore, blue and red connections are closed from Sansicario to Sauze because of a 9 year old's death, so I had to find my way back on a black slope which triggered a huge panic attack. I never had one on the slope before in my life. But really folks, black pistes are no joke here. Also, where I'm from, a lot of italian red slopes would count as black.What I don't understand is why they are not allowing people to go down on the chairlift if they cannot commute on black pistes.It's a shame. We were coming from Sauze and crossing to Sestriere, as it had more begginer and red slopes.As I said, the way back to Sauze was a nightmare and I went down the mountain in panic and fearing for my life at times. Hope this helps."
32,Good ski-ing area for immediate skiers and boarders but lack of toilet facilities is a big negative,"Varied skiing with lovely through the trees runs. Wonderful views, great mountain restaurants at reasonable prices. 2EU for a coffee, take that France!"
33,Very warm but very good,"This is a big ski area covering several resorts, for novices Montgenevre is ideal with green runs, Sauze  is a lot more mixed with easy blues and plenty red, Sestriere has challenging blues and great blacks, but in a week we visited them all"
34,Freeskiing would be good - if there would have been snow ...,"Skiing area where everybody would find slopes meeting one's needs. Long routes , great views, one can stick to one area or travel from one to another up to France. On a 6 day pass there is one day of skiing in France included."
35,Great ski resort ,Loved the skiing here.beautiful area of eye catching peaks.Lots of great runs.Perfect Intermediate area.
36,Great first family ski holiday ,slopes are great however skilifts need an upgrade. No waiting time and food in the different little restaurants along the slopes provide good quality at affordable prices....
37,Pretty Good Ski Area,Great resort and expertly run .. all staff on chair or button lifts really smiley and helpful.. worked really hard to keep conditions on ski runs to ensure good ski and board despite not having snowfall for 3 weeks ... didn’t stop anyone from having a great time skiing ..
38,OK,Stayed in Sestriere- great little hotel Il Fraitevino.  the slopes are okay considering the snow conditions but the lifts are outdated and seem to shut at the slightest excuse so you can get stuck. the signage is poor compared to france and N. America. I liked the restaurants on the slopes but they are very busy and we queued 45 mins for self service.Went to Montgenevre  by taxi one day and that was lovely- far more open terrain and better lifts. Not sure I'd go again unless they seriously improve on the lifts.
39,snowboarding holiday,"You will love the wide open piste s, and lack of crowds, also there is easy access to Sestriere.Big blue skies and loads of sunshine.Great food everywhere on the mountain too, and reasonably priced"
40,Fantastic ski area with good variety,"Advertised as large ski area but reality is the links between areas are incredibly poor ... we stayed in Sauze d’Oulx in great family run hotel Gran Baita as part of a Crystal Holiday. We arrived when they hadn’t had snow for weeks so unfortunately snow conditions were poor, though it did snow mid-way through holiday which helped. We could understand some lifts/runs being closed due to lack of snow but couldn’t understand why some higher lifts/tows e.g. high button tows in Sestriere we’re closed. We also accepted that blue/red runs back into Sauze were closed due to a fatality earlier in the season, 9 yr old child fell into ski fence/barrier. We were ok as we competent to ski the blacks but the run closures caused issues for lots of skiers in the resort. We Must frustrating thing was the fact link lifts out of Sauze were closed on 3 of our 6 days there ... closed due to ‘high winds’. 2 old slow chairlifts connect out of Sauze and if they need to close at the slightest breeze they need to invest in better more stable chairlifts or gondolas. Felt paying for full Vialattea lift pass when you can only ski the limited Sauze area for 3 of your 6 days was a rip off. On the plus side lots of nice restaurant and bars on slopes in Sauze that are very reasonably priced. Skied Sestriere one day (busier slopes, icy conditions, limited lifts open). Skied Claviere area one day ... bit of a trip to get there with gondola down from sansicario then 2 access chairs up to runs, but the snow was better and the pistes quiet. Best day was in Montgenèvre... pistes better, lifts bit faster and more runs open. We got bus there & back with Crystal so didn’t have the stress of link lifts potentially closing. Overall nice to ski somewhere new but I wouldn’t go back to area until the lift systems were upgraded. It’ll be back to the more expensive Trois Vallees for us next year ... faster better lifts, larger area that is actually well connected with far less chance of being stuck to one area."
41,As much ski-ing as you can need in a week,I have now skied in Austria france and now Italy and I love this area. great variety of runs and as a good intermediate who loves a challenge this gave me everything. Skied one day in montgenevre and this tested me to the max on the extremely steep blacks tetras in particular probably the scariest I have done
42,Needs more snow,Great place for intermediate skiing. Lovely mountain restaurants with freshly cooked food reasonably priced. Loved Sestriere. Didnt make it to Mongenevre but will definetely make it next time.
43,Fantastic Ski Area for beginners and advanced skiers,"You can skii from morning to late afternoon without doing the same track! Eating here its not very expensive, there are a lot bar and resturant all around."
44,A big area but too many runs closed.,"extensive ski area with good snow conditions and reasonable mountain prices ( except in montgenevre in france on our away day trip), decent nightlife"
45,Awful Skiing!,Great skiing area and links to other Milky Way resorts. Excellent intermediate skiing. Quiet and little or no waiting at lifts.
46,Not good for begineers,"+ Good ski area with some very nice bars and restaurants on and off the mountain.- Some lifts were closed, which made it impossible to get out of the Sauze area and explore the other villages (Sestriere, Sansicario, Montgenevre, etc)."
47,Between dream and nightmare,The pistes are great and very well prepared.Lots of slopes for all abilities.Will go back for a third time.
48,Skiing at it's best,"Great value intermediate skiing with big area to cover but lifts quite run down inc several long drag lifts, ouch! We were lucky with excellent snow and weather but lower down slopes would ordinarily be a problem late season"
49,Ski trip ,"Sestriere has a lot of accommodation so a lot of visitors, but it has not enough lifts. As a whole, Via Lattea's lifts are small, old and slow. Queue is a major problem everywhere, not just Sestriere. Since the lifts are old / low specification, they are very susceptible to closure. The lift company would not operate more lifts to alleviate queues, and the lift attendants do nothing to fill the lifts. As a result, pistes are quite empty but very long queues at lifts...everyday, not just Saturdays. The pistes were not groomed well. There were steps on the pistes, and golf ball size boulders. Some pistes were just not groomed at all. There was an extremely rude instructor who had a big beard wearing a golden jacket, who just pushed me when I was queuing. Then he came out with an excuse of I DID NOT SEE YOU. Disgusting behaviour. Overall, it was a very disappointing skiing experience in Via Lattea. I would not return to Via Lattea anytime soon. Note: if Via Lattea wants to know what modern fast and wind-tolerant lifts and good grooming look like, visit Ski Welt in Austria."
50,Annual ski trip,"It is alway nice to come back to the Vialattea to ski. A lot of mostly red slopes with a large variety. You can even ski to France, Montgenevre, one day is included in the skipass.Unfortunately, snow conditions are not very good this year, but the Italians are trying very hard to ensure good skiable slopes. And so far, they have succeeded."
51,Great Skiing,"Really well organised ski school, many thanst to Max & Sergio whose combined advice allowed me to improve in confidence on the slopes. The runs are wonderfully wide and  long and a combination of open slopes and in between trees , which meant it was never boring and always challenging, very enjoyble."
52,Huge Ski Resort,"Great selection of runs well maintained, stunning scenery and a good amount of restaurants bars and nightlife in sauze"
53,Stunning Snow,"Extensive skiing. Excellent April ski, suitable for all ages and tastes. thoroughly  recommended. Friendly service lots of mountain restaurants"
54,Winter holiday with family w8 2018,"Lovely place to visit with brill scenery, cant complaint, slopes are well kept.  Cant wait to return in 2017"
55,"Good ski,  beautiful views ","Just back from an excellent week in Vialattea area. Loads of snow & sunshine with great skiing conditions. Stayed in Sauze & skied all the ares on the pass.Great variety of runs.If staying in Sauze, think about leaving your skis at a ski deposit near a lift as there is not much door to door skiing & a lot of uphill carrying with skis. The free shuttle bus seems unreliable.Lifts are basic, no heated seats! We were in the area on a quiet week & had no difficulty in skiing the whole area. Don't miss the mens & womens olympic runs in Sansicario & Sestriere.If possible get a bus to Mongenevre so that you can spend an entire day enjoying its great pistes.It is possible to get there from Sauze but you wont have a lot of skiing time there."
56,Fabulous Traditional Alpine Village Great Wide Lovely Ski Runs,"Spent a week for New Year 2013 staying in Alpes de Relais hotel which was an excellent hotel with great staff. Resort was good crack people nice and bars,restaurants etc good value, however it was busy and we had to get a bus every morning to slopes. Bus service was attrocious with no queue system (every man/woman for themselves pushing to get on) then it broke down so we walked up to Coates lift and spent another 40 mins trying to get on a 4 man lift. It was infuriating watching every morning just one or two people at a time getting on lift, despite hundreds of people queuing (Italians are so patient & laidback, but it didnt make sense) I dont know why they dont insist on all seats being filled at peak times. We had good snow & slopes were good & plentiful but there were a lot of rocks on some slopes. I would say this is a fine resort in the low season, dont go for New year."
57,Nice pistes for families ,Great skiing throughout the area with variety of runs through trees and on open pistes. Resort suits intermediates however some of the lifts are dated and slow compared to other resorts.
58,"Great value, but run down",Beautiful views and good snow conditions. Love Sestriere :-) Some really long lifts though...not easy to get down the resort at the end of the day (Sauze) unless you are a decent skier...
59,Great ski mountain!! ,The milky way ski area is amazing skiing. Lots of variety of ski runs suitable for all abilities. Piste markers could be more often and extra signage is needed. Some amazing black and red runs which are wide and great to ride.
60,A big area with lots of choices,"Lots of runs, some very good for begginers specially at the Sestrieres resort, we stayed at Sauze D'oulux, great little village with lots of pubs and restaurants, the runs not too easy but great connection to everywhere! Overall great experience and cheaper than their neighbours France/Swiss."
61,awesome skiing,Just completed a second trip to the Vialattea area.Well linked resorts with challenging ski runs and hospitable stopping off points...on and off the piste.My favourite remains Orso Bianco in the intermediate station of Sportinia at Sauze.Will book again for next year.
62,ViaLattea - tired but still some life in the old dog - but ski map impossible to followl!,"This ski area is quite varied and encompasses a number of villages which makes for a more interesting visit. The lifts are old in places but to be honest it didn't detract from our enjoyment. The level of Skiing on the Sauze side is more suited to intermediate skiers and the Sestriere side has a good mix with more blue runs more suited to beginners. Food on the mountain is reasonably priced and typically you will pay 7-10 euros for a paste/meat dish and 4-5 euros for a panini. Here's the little niggles... 1) In comparison to Austria where nearly all pistes are prepared each night, i felt on average only around 60% of run had been pisted. To be fair, not all runs needed it but some very mogully runs were tied over to the next day. 2) There is a dead end blue run which goes down to Setriere and leads to the top of the town. From there it's about a mile walk back to the gondola. There was no clear warning for this and it wasn't fun having to walk it on a sunny day with ski boots on. 3) The piste map isn't the clearest to navigate. 4) The piste signs have very small numbers on which isn't very useful. 5) Occasionally you will come across toilets on the mountain which are a hole in the ground. This could be quite a challenge in full ski kit. That said, these are minor points. Hopefully with enough feedback Vialattea will consider making a few changes to make this area niggle free. If you are willing to put up with a few imperfections then this is an area which is well worth a visit."
63,extensive area but severely let down by lack of investment in lift system.,"This is our 4 th trip to sauze and it gets better every time, the ski area is fantastic among the best in Italy and the après ski is great too.  Fantastic area for snowboarding"
64,Under investment is showing,Skiing in everones taste! Highly recommended! Very well kept slopes. Nice restaurants. Good food. Friendly athmosphere.
65,A superb ski area with excellent pistes,Loads of area to ski but the Italan side (where I stayed) is a little samey. The piste maps are an artists impression - an impressionist at that. Great for intermediates who want to cruise the blues and reds all day but not too much of the more challenging variety for the more advanced skier
66,Great skiing experience,"Wide slopes, more fit to intermediate level.Extended ski-pass allows to cross to Sestriere.Very good places to stop for coffee and lunch and enjoy the clear sky.Very good sky schools."
67,Skiing Hols finally made it here after 20 years ,"great for intermediate skiers, nice wide pistes, both exposed mountain top and tree runs. Also easy access to Sansicoria and Sestriere, with the resorts of Claviers, Bardonneccia & Montgenevre in easy reach. More than enough for a weeks ski-ing."
68,What an amazing ski area,"Fabulous week skiing with group of 6 adults.  Loved the slopes although the piste map is the biggest waste of time we have ever seen.  My other half been skiing 42 years and he's convinced its the most out of date map he's ever read.  Be careful because you can end up on a run that's beyond your capability if its snowing and visibility is poor.Nice wide red runs that are well groomed, challenging in places, but nothing too intimidating.They didn't groom the black run at all, which for some would be more of a challenge, for others, a real pain if you want to just push yourself a little further.The bus service from our hotel was fantastic, but the local bus service was shocking.  Even the instructors were saying that they complain every year requiring additional services and nothing is done so lots of people late for ski school despite leaving hotel at 9am to get there for 10am.  The green line goes all the way up to Sportinia, but be aware, the bus with a 'green line' down the side is not the 'green line' its the blue line!!!!! you got to laugh, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.Provision of lockers and ski storage was a bit naff at the bottom of each of the lifts so not worth the hassle really.Lift passes are getting more expensive, the Italians seem to be catching on to what the French are doing increasing fees etc.  £155 lift pass, ski hire £79, £20 locker space (really just a pad lock on a wall).  Food up the mountain is costed well and you don't feel that you're being ripped off which is nice."
69,Great ski area,"When there is snow, this place is fantastic. However, have been here twice in February and there has not been very much snow, also during a year like 2019 where there was so much snow in other resorts.Anyway, there are a lot of good restaurants and pistes are mainly blue and red. The few black pistes are not that challenging but off-piste seems to be great (if there is snow).Lift capacity is not the best and there can be long queues at a few bottle necks. Also, the lifts are somewhat outdated. It was a long time ago we experienced the old classic 2-seat lift that doesn’t slow down in other ski resorts, but they still exist here :-)In all it is a great resort though, and with better lift capacity it would be perfect."
70,Great Snow,"Nice villages with good food and nice staff. Really good off-pist skiing in the forests. However, the ski system is disaster. The system under dimensioned for the number of people in the area. Haven’t seen such old lifts in ages. Super unfriendly and rude staff. Closes down the system if winds just above average. Don't know if it's because the lifts are so old or if the staff want's to go home early. We will not return."
71,Frustrasting to see the decline,"A nice skiing area with slopes of all categories. Some of the slopes are in the woods, giving good shelter on windy days. Large area, and possibility for longer trips, also to France."
72,Skiing,awesome skiing would recommend for intermediates. easy to access from oulx station. transfers via train 6 euros and 1 hour 12 mins from torino porto nova station. if you wan great affordable skiing go here.
73,Good Ski Area,"I needs some modernisation, but almost everything of Italian side of Via Lattea is great! The fresh food, the coffee, the people and the prices are great!!! Skiing is more than good with enough snow. More snowcannons are needed, due to Climate changes."
74,Skiing Sauze,Very pretty and extensive ski area. Well groomed pistes and varied terrain. Sauze D’Oulx and the linked SAN Sicario are my favourite areas with pretty tree lined runs and good value for money mountain cafes.
75,Great week in Sauze,"A huge resort, with the curious habit of closing lifts and terrain during the week in peak season, especially in the Sauze d’Oulx area. Only 2/3 of the runs were open during our stay, despite having received 60cm of new snow late in the previous week. The best skiing is in the Montgenevre section, at the far end: vast, wide well-groomed runs, all open."
76,Awesome few days,"Have visited this ski resort 4times now and I miss it every time  leave. Not the best skier, but travel with some brilliant skiers and they have plenty great adventures on these slopes. There is something for everyone and it's all set in stunning scenery. There are plenty of pit stops along the way with Sportinia having a great selection mid station. Can't wait to come back."
77,Sauze d'Oulz based ski holiday,"I love skiing here, so many places to go when links are open with easy access.I noticed that there have been some lift upgrades when compared with skiing there a year earlier - we will be back!"
78,Skiing ,"We stayed in Sauze and whilst the skiing there was nice, as we were there mid January and it was quiet the didn’t open the lifts at the top of the resort on the weekdays which is very disappointing when you’ve not paid any less for your ski pass. We skied mostly in Sansicario and Sestriere/Borgata as this was better we felt however the connection from Sauze is a very outdated and old 2 man chair lift which broke down one day. The connections to Clavier from Cesana is also a bit of a joke. You can’t get to Montgenèvre from Sauze in a day either, you need to get a coach or transfer there and back so we didn’t bother with this. I would recommend staying in Sansicario for a more central location to explore the whole region but unsure what the town is like. Overall, this area could be absolutely amazing but some serious investment in the lift system needs to take place to make it so. At present it is average."
79,Great Piste Area,"The village is still good for those who want to party, but the skiing is only average. The big downside is the poor lift system, which is old, slow & poorly situated. I would also rate the resorts piste preparation & signage as only average. On a couple of days quite a high number of pistes had not been prepared overnight, which is not good enough."
80,Great ski area,"Great place to ski, good links to other parts of the Milky Way, the restaurants are good and they have improved the lift system, moving always From the button lifts to faster chair lifts. Yes I would go back again."
81,Good skiing with excellent coffee stops,"The Italian side of  the Vialattea (Milky Way) ski area is is being let down badly by very poor piste maintenance and appallingly bad signage and piste maps. They seem to only piste the slopes on Friday nights ready for the influx of local skiers from Turin each weekend, the rest of the week the pistes are not touched. Much of the area is unsuitable for beginners as the slopes to the villages are all steep (and unpisted), the exception is Sestrierre which has a lovely gentle beginners area. Montgenevre at the French end of the Vialattea is the exception to the above with well pisted and signposted slopes"
82,A welcome break from France and with better service also less expensive.,So many slopes. Hardly qued for lifts unless it was the weekend.Did not get bored. Can't wait to come back!!!
83,Lovely skiing area,The ski area is very nice but they get much more enjoyable only as you get better at skiing! The blue run 13 has part of the piste shared with other red runs at the beginning and at the end of the slope. Therefore a beginner graduating from the magic carpet is forced to get onto a bit of red before getting onto a blue run!We skied in Sestriere on one of the days and what was meant to be a blue run no. 1 turned out to be very difficult and should certainly have been marked as red.
84,"wide area , not very busy , awsome runs","Loved the resort, the people, the pistes, accommodation - everything.Much prefer Italy to France.Would definitely recommend 😉"
85,Great Location to Visit for Skiing,Sadly the pistes are not looked after as well as other resorts we have visited.  With many closed lifts and pistes.  This was not due to the snow conditions as there was a good amount the week we skied here.
86,Could be so much better!!,"The milky way is a great ski area with a range of pistes to suit all abilities but is particularly suited to intermediates. However, the area is let down by the very slow lifts which require updating and investment. Due to the speed of many of the lifts, much of the day is spent riding on lifts rather than skiing the fantastic runs available. Lifts also shut very early (cable car from Sestriere closes at 3:45) making it difficult to access the whole of the vialattea area. It is such a shame that an area with access to so many great runs is severely let down by the outdated lift system."
87,Sestriere based return visit,"A big area with lots of choices to ski with good connecting uplift. Good runs for all levels of ability. Great bars, pizzerias and restaurants on the slopes and never very far when you need sustenance :-)"
88,Quality place ,Sestriere is a very Italian resort. Lifts and slopes are crowded with Ski schools. Lifts were often closed; understandably due to strong winds but also on sunny days. Service in restaurants and hotel was disappointing; they tend to give more expensive rates for foreigners or cheat in quality. There is no nice and relaxed afterski atmosphere as elsewhere. I have to say I cannot recommend this resort for non-italians. It is quite different in ambiance from Cervinia for example.
89,Amazing Skiing Area,"Loads to do here as you can ski a huge connected area.  We skied, Sauze D'Oulx, Sestrire and Sansicario, but you could also get across to France if you are competant and take all day to ski across and back."
90,"Lack of Investment, Poor Management, Long Queues",Wonderful skiing over approximately 400Km. Good lifts and a great choice of restaurants and snack bars
91,"Old slow lifts, long queues with no queue management, poor piste grooming",This ski resort is brilliant. Loads of pistes for all skill levels. In less snowy winters a skip over the border to Monginevre (a little higher and colder) is only a 30 minute drive from Sauze D'Oulx so you definitely wont miss out on anything.
92,Great Skiing in Sauze 'Queue',Great area for skiing and snow boarding. Lots of off piste and a couple of parks. Lifts are ok and some run till 16.30. Plenty of places to eat and reasonably priced
93,Excellent skiing,"First time in sauze, snow was great considering it was first week in April! But to have quite a few lifts closed when there was snow on the pistes I don't get. I paid for a full lift pass I couldn't use! It was to save money, but the only people to suffer were the bars and restaurants, we couldn't get to.I also didn't think the pistes were bashed properly! Great big grooves in the pistes! They started to bash pistes as the week went on and opened runs up on our last day, for the locals I think!The area is large, we got to sestriere easily, but again lifts weren't all open!There is a desperate need for investments  in the lift service! No gondola except from the top down To sestriere! Long chair lifts uncovered or long drag lifts!Getting on the first lift up is awful, icy with mud! Getting off the lift is dangerous!This place could be so much more, but they need to spend money! The town is great with nice bars and restaurants! The bus service to and from the pistes, needs to be updated! Why not add the cost of the bus onto the lift pass! Everybody was complaining about having to pay for a service which is always included wherever else I've skied! If u r going to charge make it a frequent service! Again I believe it is charged to help pay for a new lift. Even Italians I spoke to agree there needs to be investment to develop and bring people in!I would go here again as I know what I'mGetting, but I don't know how it would be in colder weather travelling on those lifts!"
94,Great skiing,"Unfortunately in mid-December 2015 there was no snow, however i think that a proper ski resort should be able to cope with this eventuality as it was cold enough. Only half of 1 slope (Sportina) was open, which existed because of snow machines so why not fire up the machines for the other runs? Also they charge you €12 for this 1 slope where you only have half a run of it. We had to go to Val Thorens for some proper boarding. This was a shame because i've seen and heard a lot about how good the slopes here are but they really need to get better management of it."
95,Fantastic ski resort,"Huge ski area, at sensible money.. helped we by a huge dump of snow just before we arrived.Vast area of pisted runs, loads of off piste, some just between / by the piste and some a tad more technical / tricky..Equally important is how well priced it is, for lift passes, mountain restaurant prices (with decent quality food too)Dot let the ski snobs put you off skiing here..it’s awesome!"
96,"Nice skiing area, variable slopes",The whole Vialattea area is great for skiers of all abilities and even though it was half-term it was nowhere near as busy as Morzine last year. Better price of beer and snacks on the mountains too!
97,SURPRISINGLY GOOD !,"A great linked are (snow depending) that has something for all levels of skiers and snowboarders.We stayed in Sauze d'Oulx and had a mixed group of skiers and boarders, ranging from beginners to advanced ability levels.Although the snow levels aren't great this year we were still able to enjoy easy access to the neighbouring resorts. The resort team work hard even in the worst snow conditions to make snow on the connecting runs to open up even more options to ski.Nearly all of the Vialattea resorts have treelined runs with blues/reds/blacks all linking up nicely so your whole crew can ride together regardless of ability.If the snow falls then head to Montgenevre or Sestriere to enjoy wide open runs with plenty of side hits and tree runs for those that want it. Sauze d'Oulx also has it's fair share but you can always ride here on the way home at the end of the day. It's possible to ski all the way around the valley (snow depending) and if you're a fairly quick you can get it done in around 6 hours. My advice would be take your time and use your week (or two) to explore each resort and find the bits you like best.Probably one of my favourite resorts in Italy and I could see going back at some point.Well worth considering for your ski/snowboard trip."
98,"Expansive and impressive ski area, overly creative cartographers","Well groomed and some snow making but too many lifts closed. One area was closed all week and a lift only ran on Saturday. The top route from Montgenevre to Claviere (100) has been reopened after 4 years, which is great, and we skiing over with great expectations to find the first 2 lifts we came across in Claviere closed for no obvious reason."
99,Something for everyone,"I've worked 4 seasons here and had one holiday, this ski area always delivers!!! 400kms, a lovely choice of mountains bars and restaurants. Plenty to keep you busy!!!"
100,Great resort with fabulous red and black runs,"Although lacking much snow this season, still enough runs open for an intermeadiate skier. Plenty of good mountain restaurants to keep you going"
101,Great snow and ski experience,Couldn't ski the whole thing in a week - great snow - lovely people.
102,Intermediate Tailored Resort,"Third visit to the Milky Way.... Friendly, short queues, open well kept pieste, great views,,,, not too demanding a great restaurants and bars on the slopes.... So much cheaper and friendlier than most French resorts..... Great for families and groups of friends what ever the age...."
103,Good snow in second week of Jan,Well done to the main man sergio.  Shoulder is getting better.  I will be back facing 'down the mountain '  not falling down the mountain  lol
104,Extensive skiing and good value with amazing scenery,"The Vialattea is a great ski area, covering many miles of lovely empty runs through trees. We stayed in Sauze d'Oulx which is a great base to be able to access the Vialattea."
105,"Massive ski area, all abilities catered for","Skied 'The Milky Way' and enjoyed some great skiing.  A good variety of different pistes for different abilities, however I wasn't convinced the pistes were graded correctly!  skied a black run which was more like a blue!  and a few very narrow steep blue runs! The piste map doesn't always relate to the markings and piste numbers on the ground though beware!.  All in all though, there are some great runs, with a lot of variety.  A large bowl with lots of wide gentle slopes and some lovely long runs through the woods.  Lift system was generally very good even though some chairlifts are getting old and queues were almost non existant.  Area lift pass also includes one day's skiing in neighbouring France (Montgenevre),  There was a one day lift operator's strike (Italian side) whilst we were there, but we were still able to ski in Montgenevre, as the tour ooperator bussed us there for the day."
106,Nice! ,Great place to visit. Went for a ski holiday there and really enjoyed. Staff and locals are very helpful. Night life in Souze is nice as well
107,Great resort,"There are plenty of nice ski runs in the Milky Way but the lift system is outdated.  The majority of lifts are very slow and as soon as there is a whiff of wind, they are shut.  We were stranded in Sestriere on three occasions because the gondola link to the rest of the Milky Way was closed.  The link to France is also very slow and mainly lift travel."
108,Brill Ski Resort,"First trip to the area and thoroughly enjoyed skiing.  Most days slopes became relatively empty as the day progressed.Lift passes are not expensive - potentially reflects that the lift infrastructure is not as modern as other resorts I have stayed at.Two button lifts top left of Sauze, as you look at piste map, only operate at weekends. Not obvious until you try to use on a weekday! Ski area on and off piste was good though, probably because not used as much.Watch out for piste signage - not always easy to spot and by the time you do, it can be too late. As a previous reviewer states, give yourself time to get back just in case you miss a sign as lifts stop running promptly. Restaurants across the ski area are numerous and provide good fairly inexpensive food. Numerous bars and restaurants in Sauze that cater for all tastes. Most offer free bar snacks which can cut down the food bill. Fun place to ski and stay."
109,sunny skiing,"Vialattea is a ski area consisting of several linked resorts all of good quality and ability. We struck it lucky this year arriving just after a good dump of snow so we had a great week, although more snow would have been beneficial when we left. There are good cafe's on the slopes and good bars in Sauze D'Oulx where we were based. Given the opportunity we would not hesitate to return."
110,Good range of quiet pistes,Lovely Italian resort - perfect for beginners and intermediates. My 8 year old daughter started on the nursery slopes and was skiing black runs by the end of the week!
111,Back for the 4th time,"The lift infrastructure was most basic I’ve seen, during the Italian holidays queues for the lifts can get busy, we experienced over the New Year around a 30min wait Clotes lift and the around a 15 min wait for the Sportina lift to get up the mountain at 9am.  The queues at Clotes, Sportina and Sansicario had wait times of around a 20 mins most of the day to excess the ski runs, Sestriere and Montgenevre were less busy and Claviere was the least busy. The lifts opened around 8.45 to 4.30pm.  .  The highlights for me was the tree lined skiing, sheltered location and skiing down red 79 onto 71 (6/7km long) to the gondola mid station to Cesana, then get two chair lifts up to Claviere area then follow the signage to Montgeneve.  The scenery around Claviere is outstanding and not a lot of skiers make the trek. We had blue skies every day and the conditions weren’t too cold.  The system for lunch on the mountain during holiday times means queuing for around 30mins to get something to eat, you queue to pay 1st, then you queue order your drink and then your queue order your food, therefore I skipped lunch most day and enjoyed the less queues on the lifts."
112,Fantastic views,"3rd Time Skiing the Milky Way, Love it, snow was really good, good mountain food, slopes were a little busy on the Saturday when all the local appear but during the week they were fine"
113,Great for intermediates,All five mountains are joined so you can ski from italy to france and back in one day. Sauze and San Sicario are my personal favourites
114,Beautiful and Brilliant,"Ski trip 3/2/2013 group of friends and family age 20 to 50? A traditional ski village not a purpose built modern construction. Plenty of shops,bars and restaurents. It is on a hill so if staying nearer bottom of village it is a bit of a hike up to the Clotes lift especially if in ski boots carrying skis but not unreasonable if you are reasonably fit. However avoid this and get the bus! stay on till sportina lift and miss out clotes lift up. Ski back to village at end of clotes piste and walk back via bars. Recommend The village straight across from end of piste much bigger inside then looks from outside and the best free apres food anywhere. Gorgeous fresh pizza and snacks.  Also Paddys and The Grotto who give out fab pizza too. Italy is so much cheaper then France who give you nothing in the bars and the people are all so friendly. Ski area is large and good for intermediates. Quite a bit of off piste too if you are lucky and get fresh snow. The down side? the lift system is in serious need of updating. The 2 main lifts out of sauze are long cold and old. It was very cold while we were there and got no sun on the lifts and we were seriously cold by the time we got right to the top especially if you use the link to get over to the other areas. They kept stopping constantly and broke down altogether eventually 1 day. Fortunately we had already gone up but were stuck on it ages freezing. The long drag to get back over to Sauze was bitterly cold the day we used it and the snow cannons were on full blast so you got pebbledashed by them too. This needs replacing,i thought i had lost my fingers by the end. These lifts need updating with at least covers over. There is only 1 bubble link to Sestriere and this was shut 1 day also due to high wind. We were stuck there all afternoon. They did put buses on to get people back to own resorts but took over 3 hours to sort this out. Apparently they had been giving announcements out on the lifts warning of this but it had all been in Italien! so we and a couple of hundred others didnt know. This all sounds very bad but we had very cold temperatures -15 to 18 with wind chill one day,bitterly cold.Perhaps with warmer weather we may not have noticed this as much and would have a better opinion but they do need to spend money on the lifts they are not adequate especially at the weekend when the italiens came out to play the queues were awful. However, i did enjoy my ski here we had some fantastic nights out and i will go back to italy as it is so much cheaper than rip off France and the people are lovely and friendly."
115,An accomplished ski area,"I have skied in most of the big European ski areas, and the Milky Way/ Vialattea has to rate as one of the best. There's about 400km of pistes and very few people compared to France and Austria. The only queues we encountered were at the weekends when the Italians were up from Turin, Genoa and Milan. You can ski 5 different resorts on your pass (only one day in the French resort of Montgenevre). From Sauze the links to Sestriere and Sansicario are evry easy and you can be in those resorts in about 40 minutes. The price of the lift pass was very reasonable, €180 for 6 days. Prices in the mountain restaurants was about 40% less than you'd pay in France, and they smiled!Apres ski was very focused around the bars in Sauze, which isn't a problem, but unlike Austria, people seem to drink more from 9pm-2am, rather than straight off the mountain. We also went to an ice hockey game in Briancon involving two of the top French sides. Never been before, but it was an excellent atmosphere and exciting to watch. We also booked the ski away day with the Neilson reps, you can ski the links, but it seemed more sense to take the bus. If the snow is as good as February 2014 next year, we'll be back."
116,Great varied ski-ing,"Relais des Alpes hotel - excellent hotel. Spotlessly clean, food fantastic, staff/service very very good."
117,Choose you valley to your level,Huge ski area for intermediates. I wouldn't recommend for beginners because you have to take a lift to reach the ski school area. You need to be able to ski blue runs really.
118,Must sort out the lifts,Mostly chair lifts (a few drag or carpet lifts for beginners. The option to explore the other resorts that are linked in to this area. Pistes are pretty quiet except for weekends.
119,ski paradise,"When the snow is good, the Vialattea is a great ski-area.  OK, so perhaps they could upgrade a few lifts to be quicker, but the pistes are varied and well thought out.  There are plenty of places to have a drink and something to eat in Sauze - compared to Montgenèvre (two on slopes!).  You feel like to can travel in a day - so you can make a good ski-tour up rather than just quick ups/downs.  Each valley has a different feel - open ski-ing to tree-lined piste.  The resort has a lovely relaxed feel and the staff are always helpful and cheerful.So - keep your eye on the snow reports and just have a great time and explore as much as you can."
120,Excellent ski area,"Really loved the pistes, especially the Olympic and Kandahar pistes. Wide, good maintained. Just the lifts could be newer, but it's always a matter of investments."
121,THE BEST SNOW OF THE SEASON,"Most of the time majority of the litfs were closed beacuse of 'strong winds'. Lifts connecting to other resorts were shut down while there was no skibus which could take us to nearby Montgenèvre, which by the way was fully operational in the very same conditions. I fully get the safety argument, but lifts here are closed because of a mild breeze! 20km/h wind at the top and lifts are closed all over the mountain. That's just absurd. Cherry at the top - there is no refund policy for skipass, even when ALL chairlifts in the area got shut down. Not recommend if you travel by plane or a bus. You're taking a huge gamble for the litfs being closed. Take a car, then you might get away with driving to nearby french resort - Montgenèvre and save the day."
122,Nice skiing holiday,Stayed over new year which meant the ski lifts were very busy. The design of the resort means that there's a real bottleneck at lots of places as often there is only one lift out. This made for a lot of long queues. We were in Sauze d'oulx which was easy to connect to some of the resorts but frankly getting to France and back is a real faff. There's quite a few times you need to take skis off and hike. The lifts are a bit old in places and this exacerbates the queues and they badly need a singles queue because often chairs are half empty as people trying to stay with groups. Pistes are all very groomed which makes for super easy blacks and reds which was very enjoyable. I would say when snow is sparse is more of a skiers resort than boarders as there's a lot of paths although expert boarders may have no problems.
123,Fantastic skiing!,"Just spent a week skiing in Sauze and had great weather and snow conditions all week.The lift system needs some updating as there are a number of bottlenecks.There are 3 quad chairs from Sauze up to the Sportinia area (lifts 4, 6 & 9 on the ski map) but only one quad chair (lift 15) to take you to the summit where most of the best skiing is!In the next bowl along there are 2 lifts (10 & 11) which are very, very slow and create further queues for people skiing the bowl or travelling to and from  Sansicario or Sestrierre.  These bottlenecks cause major queues especially at week-ends when the Turin residents turn up. Unfortunately skiers don't know how too queue now and it is every man for himself!"
124,Could be so much better,"The domain is well maintained in general and well signaled.The snow quality is OK and when the piste is open it means the snow quality is enough for security reasons.The main problem is indeed the wind, because often the connection mostly between Sestriere and Sauze D'Oulx"
125,Great ski resort and friendly people,"Sadly, little snow and what was here was very heavy skiing. On the Sauze side the connecting lift to open the range up was more than 70% closed which was frustrating. Closing this lift makes Sauze pretty small on its own."
126,Lovely sji area,"Brilliant, loads of snow, new lifts in Sauze and Sestriere and best of all great value for money and no sill y prices on the slopes."
127,"Great place, cheaper than French resorts, just as good",Very good blue sky skiing for most of our week and some lovely mountain restaurants to stop at. Italian people working/skiing in resort were very pleasant
128,Half working resort,This is one of my favorite resorts. Really varied and good for a wide range of skiiers. The slopes are generally quite wide which is great when it gets icy. We also went in March during Dutch ski week (don't miss it if you like a party!). The weather was great and the snow was still in really good condition.
129,Difficult season with not much snow early,Stayed in sauze d'olux found some nice runs though the piste markings were in places vague and not very accurate.
130,Our Ski Trip,"Such a pretty area to ski in, the tree lined lower slopes are magical to ski through. Mid station Sportinia has a good selection of value for money popular eateries, where 2€gets you a big cappuccino. The slow chairlifts as people have commented on are a nice breather and give you chance to take a great photo. A great all ability ski area with a snow park  , you feel like a local whenever you visit."
131,Great and big skiarea!,If you are going over the kids holidays be prepared for massive queues for all the chairlifts! It’s actually ridiculous how long we waited to get up to Sportinia and then up again - 45 minutes was the average wait time. Having skied in both France and Austria these were some of the worse wait times I have ever experienced. The area is not designed for beginners and the lack of snow meant the lower slopes were getting very thin and icy. Would not consider going back again unless it was outside school holidays
132,Miles Of Potential Lifts Never Open,Just returned from 4 days skiing. Snow just about held up. The lifts closed on the last day due to wind which was a shame really restricted the skiing. I enjoyed it but my husband who was a beginner struggled as there's not many blue runs and some of the reds are quite steep. I'd probably not recommend here for beginners.
133,Nice long runs,"liked:short flight,short transfer,loads of snow,miles of pistes,the people.Had an evening  meal up the mountain transported by a modified piste basher to the Mollino only problem was the food just kept on comming so much so the we had to refuse some of it,we should have been warned by the reps but weren`t.dislikes :having to wait a year before we can go back."
134,Friendly resorts with unlimited options,"First time skiing in Italy and I was impressed!  Loved the Italian ski gear - they put the Brits to shame with their gorgeous stylish clothes.  Most of the Italians were also wearing helmets but a fair amount weren't so I think it is up to you to decide.Having skied a lot in Europe I felt this was a good resort for groups of mixed ability.  Two of the group had excellent private lessons (he turned out to be a trainer for the Italian Paralympic ski team) and they progressed massively with five hours tuition, allowing us to ski together on day two.  Yes there is loads to ski on although I felt the grading was a bit erratic.  Watch out for the ""blue"" going over to Sestriere under the cable car, as it becomes really steep in one section and scared the learners so much they wouldn't ski it again. My ""intermediate"" son had a near miss as he fell on the same run the next day and landed up near a steep edge overlooking rocks as no piste bashing had been carried out.  The best for early intermediates are the runs back to Sportinia.  When we were there (first week in January) the conditions were good although I didn't ski right back to Sauze as the last section of the slope remained really icy all week.The newest chairlift wasn't operating when we were there, so we couldn't do a big chunk of the ski runs.  Watch out for lifts closing, as other guests in our hotel got caught out and came back in the dark having mis-timed the distance they'd travelled.  We didn't find the rest of the lifts a problem and the queues were usually fairly short.There was no sign of grotty toilets so perhaps they've all been upgraded.  The restaurants and eateries were really good value compared to France.  Our favourite was the one at the top  by the cable car as they had good food and the best coffee in Sauze.  We took the cable car down to Sestriere and thought it looked too modern and boxy compared to Sauze which is more authentic.  Would go again to this resort, and see the feedback on the lovely Hotel Grand Besson!"
135,Dried out experience,"One of the best areas about. Not the most challenging but very enjoyable. Well Worth a visit. Empty monday to friday, bit busier at the weekends."
136,Nice slopes on the Vialattea and very friendly people,Translated simply as the milky way.  Perfect for beginers and intermediates and the ski pass allows you to ski in montgenerve or sestriere also.
137,Ski school,"Conditions perfect - best mix of slopes I've experienced. Lovely tree lined reds and blues and challenging reds and blacks if wanted. Picturesque, not too busy. Excessive area with Vialattea pass - totally brilliant!!"
138,Not just for the British...!,A fantastic array of slopes for intermediate - advanced skiers with so many areas to visit on the Milky Way ski pass. Empty slopes and no lift queues during the week a definite bonus!
139,Great Location - Lack of early season snow,"Lots to do and see for skiers and riders of all abilities.The ProsAffordable ski passHuge linked areaChoice of terrainFast, open, GS or carving opportunities abundantThe ConsVery slow lifts in many of the areasUnreliable ski bus in SauzeCrowds at peek timesLimited return to base options can result in congestionThis is a wonderful ski area and very convenient to Turin Airport.  The grading of the runs is suspect and will flatter those  intermediates who want to try more black runs.  I'd rate most runs as blue or red.  There is plenty of opportunity to ski off piste either between runs or via trekking.  The ski park is limited however it offered those that were using it a fun filled day to practice their tricks.  The lift system is a mixture of old and new.  That said many of the lifts across all the resorts were running painfully slow.  The ski map hasn't changed much over the years and on slope signage could be easily improved to aid the route planning and transit between resort.Well worth a visit for all levels.  If you found my review helpful please click the button.  Thank you."
140,"Unless you live in Torino, go to Dolomiti!","A fantastic place to ski. We started in Sestriere, skied there and Saux d'ould extensively and also went on a day trip to Montgenevre. Had to get a bus back to Pragelato (pre planned) as we travelled so far it would have been difficult to get back in time. Wonderful skiing everywhere"
141,Fantastic skiing,"Great budget ski option love the place, for all you moaners get over yourselves.  It's not the high end resorts of France but it's not trying to be either.   Get yourselves to Italy :)"
142,Keep it a secret!!!!!!!!!!!,Large area with a wide variety of slopes. Especially many red slopes. varying from open meadow high up to slopes through the forrest; from very wide to small and curved. Some long slopes; like the Olympica (black). Most chair elevators; some disc elevators. Not crowded (week of Feb 16 2014)
143,Vialattea Rocks!,"We went to Sauze d'Oulx for skiing with our youngsters (23-31 year). The skiing was OK with slopes with different difficulties, most blue and red. The slopes was good prepared every morning. To get to Sestriere you had to take a cabin lift and if it's wind they close it so it was only 2 days we could go there."
144,Great skiing,They promote the biggest ski area in Europe and then regularly close the only lift that connects Sauze to this area. Don't go here unless you want to be bored after the first day.
145,good ski area with great value lift pass,Great week of snow in Vialattea. Nearly all lifts working. Pistes in good condition with loads of snow production even though it snowed.
146,Ski area,"Skied this over the new year period based in Sestriere- but used Gondola to access Suaz and other connected areas.Some of the piste maps are mis leading and if your not at least an intermediate, and on your own, you can expect a blue run but end up on a steep red!Saying that plenty red runs were so wide and pisted that they were effectivley blues, and easy to ski- even some blacks were no more than a steep red in other countries!saw quite a few accidents, with air helecopter arriving quickly to take unfortunate individuals away to hospital-Mountain resturants I thought were better than the food in resort and cheaper too- tip- arrive for your lunch before 12 or after 2pm to avoid ski school ques!also quite often no english signs etc telling you what to do- you order food and drinks at one counter and collect at another when your number is read out (IN ITALIAN- SO SHOW YOUR NUMBERED RECEIPT SO THEY CAN IDENTIFY YOU!)Unless you speak Italian of course!Talking about ques!- Is it only the English that do this! saw a few heated arguments with the locals all fighting in ques for lifts which can be long!. This was the only negative about the whole ski area- there was no order to queing, and a free for all!That aside- great skiing in a vast area- loved it!"
147,"“Sauze d’Oulx – Good and Bad”,",Can't fault it. You can ski for days without repeating yourself. The runs are well pisted. I felt safe yet challenged all week.
148,Great skiing,"Ok they needed a dump of snow but the milky way compares well with other big areas like the Porte du Soleil. Lots to explore, great choice of off piste etc. clavieres well worth a visit and did't even get to Montgenevre in five days. Will be back"
149,"Great part of the Milky Way!,","We visited Sauze D'Oulx 3 years ago and enjoyed the combination of great snow and ski runs together with fabulous Italian hospitality.The chair lift system out of Sauze gives you 2 options. Clottes from the very centre - which is a slower chair lift to just above the nursery slopes. Then there is a faster 4 man chair taking you almost to the top of the Sauze side of the mountain.The other option is to take the slightly more remote Sportinia lift (free ski bus there anywhere - 3-4 mins drive from Clottes) and then the chair above that to ski off into the various parts of what they call 'the milky way' linked ski area.Last time we visited we used Sportinia as it was quicker with fewer beginners jostling and falling. However the next chairlift above Sportinia to the top and beyond was slow and the queues could be huge - especially on a sunny day.We were skiing at English half term this year, but the chair above Sportinia has been replaced by a fast modern 4 man chair. This improves matters greatly and on a very busy day with a large queue, people were whisked away so quickly, we waited for just 5 minutes or so.A fabulous improvement - and this Italian resort now transports its skiers with the efficiency of the best of the French."
150,Ski the milky way,"After spending a winter vacation in Via Lattea we also passed through during summer. Enough to do, besides off course walking in the mountains!"
151,Plenty to keep you skiing all day,"We were there ski-ing for a few days and chose the place because of its proximity to Malpensa airport where we have daily direct flights there. Vialattea is around 2 hours away from Malpensa airport and we drove to Oulx where we stayed. There are several mountains which are linked by gondolars. Even driving between mountains is convenient. We prefer the Italian side of Vialattea because of their longer runs. However I was shocked by the lack of toilette facilities. There are no public toilets at all so we had to rely on toilet facilities offered by the bar/restaurants. However bar/restaurants only have one or two toilets available so there is always a long queue waiting and because they are so overused, they are quite dirty. Even though Vialattea offers some nice steep runs but runs are not very long. Also there are no gondolas from bottom to top of the mountain, there are often long queues at the chairlifts. The top parts of the mountain are often served by bottom lifts which are not board friendly. I think I prefer ski-ing in Japan based on the overall ski-ing experience even though the price is about the same."
152,2nd time in the Milky Way,Loads of red runs from Sauze to Montgenevre - you can ski for miles. sauze has lovely long runs through the trees. Pretty when the sun shines and sheltered when weather bad. Good all-rounder for intermediates.
153,Amazing,"We had good snow and some sun, so perfect conditions.  Stayed in Sauze d'Oulx and found it a good base for local skiing and also take the lifts and ski into Sestriere and Sansicario.  Lots of runs and good reds for intermediate skiers."
154,"Disneyland in the woods , but then with ski's.","There is a lack of snow in the area, but nevertheless the feeling you get is that they have the slopes and the lifts at the minimum, and could have more open. The place is very nice, but in the end we only skied in the Sauze d´Oulx side"
155,Unexpected ski resort ,"None too busy in January and the legendary 400km of piste is beautiful and great fun to get around. Great value food and drink on the slopes, too!"
156,Sauze piste,"The ski slopes that builds up the milky way are somewhat uneven. crowded Sestriere, outdated Sauze d'Oulx, and nice Sansiscario, great claviere and (take your ski-pass and visit) outstanding Mongenevre. But to sum up all of those and You will find plenty of wonderfully prepared slopes. Worth it!"
157,Fourth time back in this ski area,"This is a very large connected area however some connections require quite a bit of polling.  The opportunity to ski into France is nice but it takes quite a while.  Also, it is a shame that you are often required to ride lifts down the hill. You have the feeling that all you are doing is riding lifts with less skiing than would be possible were some improvements made.  Overall, very nice and a good value but not as nice as the Sella Ronda."
158,"If staying is Sauze, its not worth going further than Sesriere or San sicario","this is a huge ski area; a standard 6-day skipass is not enough to ski all the slopes, unless you're lucky and have excellent weather for all days; e.g. it's not feasible to stay in Sauze and go to ski to France for more than 1-2 hrs and come back; the area is so big that I think everybody finds something interesting for themselves; suprising thing is lack of restaurants / bars on the upper slopes in the French part; Sestriere seems to be an optimal place  to stay if one plans to explore the whole area."
159,Beginners Beware!,Great connectivity between the resorts with few queues even at busy times. Stunning Mountain scenery with great restaurants tucked away in surprising places.
160,great ski holiday,"Enjoyed the whole area, excellent runs and good conditions. Based in Sauze D'oulx but ventured out to the other resort areas using our ski passes was a great way to explore the area. Good prices for food and a great array of pasta dishes to keep you going!!! Stunning views from the runs as well. Will be back !!!"
161,Superb ski area,"Likes: Massive, great long reds and blacks, fairly priced bars on piste.No-Likes: not a lot, the blues are way flat & narrow"
162,Good Week,"Excellent snow conditions and reasonable weather, more than enough extensive skiing for intermediates for a whole week. Great value on the slopes for food and drink, meals are fine but not remarkable, your euros will go a long way. The lift system is not the best however because of the lack of crowds it's not really an issue. Would return again to ski the same slopes as you can visit a number of resorts."
163,Large ski area with a lot of options,"Great ski area.  Stayed at Jovenceaux and didn't even make it as far as Sestriere, there's so much to ski!  If you want to ski to Montgenevre, you need to either be able to do it flat out all day, or get a us."
164,Via lattea ski area,One of the best ski/snowboard resorts I have been to in the Alps/Dolomites. (Possibly the best based on how friendly the Italians are and the comparison of drinks prices between France and Italy)
165,Love this place,"Full and Varied choice of Skiing, Good lifts and Restaurants. Plenty of alternatives to fill a week on the slopes."
166,Great hotel for a large group,"The Via Lattea, or if you prefer the Milky Way, is a vast ski area with lots of terrain to explore. Basing ourselves in Sauze d’Oulx it was a great area to ski as much as we could. Visiting in January the snow conditions were great although the weather was cold, so make sure to where plenty of layers. The resort has plenty of snowmaking facilities which were running almost 24/7 on the lower slopes and resort runs in Sauze D’Oulx. A few runs and lifts had not been opened and some runs became a little icy but nothing that an intermediate skier wouldn’t be able to handle. The resorts of Sauze d’Oulx, Sestriere, Sansicario, Calviere and Montgenevre offer a truly ‘Olympic’ amount of runs and are all well linked and it is easy to explore the piste’s of all the resorts. I would describe it as a resort to suit intermediate skiers with some of the runs a few unusually graded. A few slow lifts and drags remain which will be noticeable if you have visited some of the more well known resorts. However the ski area can only improve with more people visiting this wonderful intermediate resort. In Sauze try Red 11 onto Red 29 to 2000 and finish with Blue 52 into resort, in Sestriere the Black World Cup Kandhar piste is a must try for any advanced skiers and in Sansicario the Olympic piste is a great run down."
167,Amazing Views,"There is nothing to dislike here, even the button lifts are in relatively good shape. The skiing area is vast and offers challenges to all levels. There are loads of parks to practice your 360s. I's very cool that you can ski into France, into Montgenevre. It will take a couple of hours, though, so make sure you're up for first lift on that day. Also a good tip is that if the weather is bad on the Italian side, chances are it will be better in France. I would like to return as soon as possible!"
168,Great area,links to other resorts adds interest. Nice mountain restaurants dotted around.
169,Great ski area with superb views,"Great skiing for all levels, with stunning days alternating with snowy days. Cheerful staff, great food, beautiful scenery. A regular free bus took us to and from the chair lift each day. The instructors from Scuola Sci & Snowboard were superb, both for the seasoned skiers amongst us, those intermediates who were trying to shake bad habits, and the 7 and 10 year old beginners in our party.One of the best holidays ever."
170,The skiing is ok but the lift system is dated & slow,well groomed pistes and one of the most picturesque ski resorts I've seen.Only downside is the trip over to MontGenevre from the Italian side takes you over dozens of lifts without enough skiining-but well worth the trip
171,Excellent variety of Pistes for all abilities,"We ski in Italy because of its fabulous scenery, friendly locals and reasonable prices. BUT, Sauze-d'Oulx has a most inefficient public bus service. Nor is it included in the lift-pass nor covered by Tourist Tax. Approaches to the lifts are not properly maintained - no rubber mats nor gravel on icy patches. The piste map is perhaps the least useful of any in the Alps - its one sheet covers the entire length of Vialattea from Sauze d'Oulx to Montgenevre, so the detail for each resort is tiny, incomplete and badly drawn. Piste markers are few and far between, so route-finding can be problematical. No telecabins, only 3 and 4-seat chairlifts, none with covers and some are single-speed. Worse, some have no gap between the chair armrest and the armrest of the ski foot-rest. Some years ago, this caused a catastrophic injury to a child whose neck was caught between the two, unnoticed and exacerbated by fellow passengers, so this type of chair is now rarely seen outside Italy.   We didn't ski much beyond Sauze but, judging by what we saw, standards in this resort are twenty years behind those commonly found in France and Austria.  We shall certainly ski again in Italy, though not in Sauze d'Oulx."
172,some really good skiing to be had,Good skiing for seasoned skiers - not as good for absolute beginners! Pistes were well groomed and we had plenty of snow (luckily!)
173,Milky Way,"Just back from a week in Sauze and the runs are all good and varied but the lifts need updating.  There are too many drag lifts in the resorts and some of them, for example from Sanscicario, are the only link back into the milky way.  They are way too long to be a comfortable way to get around.  Also when sking in Borgata in Sestriere  there is one long chair which opens up some lovely runs, but they all lead back to one bottleneck to get down to the one main lift (there is one other lift but that is on the extreme left which serves just a few runs down.  Also the link from Sestriere to Claviere takes over an hour, it needs a gondola.But if you don't mind mile long and steep drag lifts the sking is good.At the moment the community have also cut down on the number of buses running to the chairlifts - they were running from 8.30 a.m. but only one every 45 minutes."
174,Good for Intermediates,"The Vialattea offers an impressively sized ski area, covering numerous resorts up to and even across the French border. There are runs to suit all abilities, although the balance of the pistes seems to lean strongly towards intermediate skiers, with many wide red runs. I accessed Viallatea from Sauze d'Oulx, of which the centrepoint is Sporinia, a bowl into which a number of runs (blue, red and black) all lead, making for an ideal meeting place.Sauze does suffer from a lack of difficult black runs, although the run down from the top of the two man chair (Colo) is steep and long, a great leg-burner of a run. Sestriere  also has a handful of more challenging runs for advanced skiers.Those used to skiing in resorts serviced by fast and advanced lift systems may find some of the slow lifts in the area frustrating. The link out of Sauze d'Oulx to the other Vialattea resorts for example is accessed either by a slow two man chairlift (which due to its speed and size can be prone to significant queues on Saturdays in particular), or an equally slow button lift, which snakes its way up a steep black run, rendering it potentially unsuitable for novice skiers. Likewise the main lift out of Sauze d'Oulx town, Clotes, although a four man lift, is also not a high-speed lift, meaning early morning queues are sometimes a problem.Also, in typical Italian style, piste categorisation and map-drawing is at best unpredictable. The size of the map (individual maps for individual resorts not being provided) means you often have to squint to figure out where runs start and finish, and even then advertised runs sometimes do not correspond to the locations printed on the map. Also, a number of pistes are poorly categorised - some blacks are at best average reds (included perhaps to entice advanced skiers), and the advertised blue run from the Sportinia area to the bottom of the Clotes lift would prove far too difficult for the novice skier. One beginner I travelled with was told by his instructor when he asked about this run ""Do not attempt it, this is not a blue run"". Again, this is probably categorised as a blue run simply so it can be included on the map as such.These faults aside, tree-lined runs, excellent slope-side restaurants, a decent mix of runs, a huge overall ski area and resorts offering much better value for money than many of their Austrian and French counterparts makes Vialattea a wise choice of destination."
175,Great for intermediates!,"Great skiing  in the trees above Sauze d'Oulx, extending to Sestriere and as far as France! Weather usually good, at least for us. Enjoyed it so much we bought an apartment in Sauze!"
176,Ski area Milky Way,Great resort with some fantastic skiing for all levels. We was lucky enough to have plenty of snowfall prior to our arrival. The only downside to the skiing is the runs aren't laid out very well an we found it difficult to navigate around! Night life was okay always something going on. Would go again!
177,MASSIVE,"Fantastic variety of runs but watch out - not only blue often turns red, it turns black as well! A ski instructor is the best way to find your way round Milky Way. Lifts are ancient but runs are well groomed and beautiful."
178,Extremely good skiing and good nite life,"It was my first time back in 10 years and it is still a great place to be and ski. We stayed in the near by village of Sauze d'Oulx which is a the foothill of the resort. Each morning we use the chair lift in the village to take us up. It cost around 29 euros each day for our passes but they are many options to choose from. I hired my ski gear from the local ski shop up the mountian and the staff couldn't have been more helpful, they were wonderful as I was a complete novice! They helped with all my gear and for a great price. The resort itself is clean, tidy and massive with loads of runs and loads of room for people to ski and have a good time, it's great for first timers like myself or ski experts looking for something new. The staff on the chair lifts are firendly and helpful and always smiling. I had a lesson on my first day with Alex, he is a delight! So helpful and friendly and extremely patient! There are plenty of eating places and toilets and I strongly recommend the egg and bacon roll. We will most certianly be back sooner this time."
179,Miles of pistes and no queues,"we didn't get any new snow all week, but grooming was good and lifts have improved in last 5 years. We enjoyed eating at Capanna Kind as it was included in our hotel stay, but there are plenty of good mountain restaurants."
180,favourite ski area to date,"The Milky Way Ski Area(Via Lattea; Voie Lactée),    We have just returned from a week’s skiing the Milky Way staying at Hotel Edelweiss below Sauze d’Oulx village in Italy.    Great hotel in a great ski-in ski-out location. The Milky Way ski area was good and snow conditions on the Sauze d’Oulx side better than Sestriere which was slushy in the afternoon.    However, we were involved in an incident which none of us in the group, with collectively over 120 years of skiing experience, has ever heard the like of before. We got the last lift up to the top and skied to the Sportinia mid-station area by 16.25. Within 10 mins of ordering a beer the police arrived to inform everyone sitting outside that the lifts / ski runs were closed and to drink up and move on. The police then departed. We left the mid-station at 17:10 to find that there was a piste basher bashing the lower slopes, with no warning lights or beepers operating except when it was reversing. The third and fourth members of the group skied on the freshly groomed snow and were spotted by the piste basher driver, who climbed out of his machine and forcibly stopped the third person in the group, subjecting him to a physical assault (pushed him to the ground such that a ski came off, slapped him around the helmet, pulled his goggles and glasses from him, picked him up and threw him back to the ground). Picking up the ski which had come off, the piste basher driver said that he was working and to get off the mountain and that we should have taken the chairlift down! If the fourth person had chosen to video this incident rather than intervene to try to calm things down, this would have gone viral on You Tube and the piste basher driver might be in jail.    This was a distressing incident which happened only because the local authorities have set up laws which appear to be selectively enforced and cannot be complied with, and working practices which put skiers at risk.   Given that skiers and their money are the lifeblood of this community, this seems to be remarkably short-sighted.    So in our opinion, the Milky Way ski area authorities need to address the following points: -   Why are more than 12 % of the lifts / runs consistently closed when   snow conditions are good? It seemed to us they were economising,   denying us the full value of our lift passes;   Why do the lifts shut at 16:15 or 16:30 in March when other resorts   open later? (One of our group was in Val d’Isere three weeks   previously where lifts ran until 17:00);   Why are people sat outside the mid-station bars informed by the   Polizia or Caribinieri that the slopes are closed and that they   should move on, when people sitting inside the premises are not   similarly informed, and where the proprietors continue to serve?   Why are piste bashers allowed to start at 17:00 from the bottom of   the pistes, rather than the top, when it is known that there are   still skiers on the slopes?   Why are the piste bashers not fitted with flashing lights and beepers   (as in other resorts) if they are working when it is known that there   are still skiers on the slopes?   Until these issues have been addressed publicly by the Milky Way authorities, we would recommend that you spend your money elsewhere."
181,Huge ski area with dramatic scenery,"We were very lucky, this season has seen very poor snow in this area but the snows came the day before we arrived and it carried on dumping all week.My third time in Sauze and when the snow is good and all the lifts are open it is a great ski area but here lies the problem. Being quite far south, the snow is a bit hit and miss and they don't seem to be able to make snow to the same extent as some of the Austrian resorts, maybe the temperatures are higher?The other problem is the lift system. It is very dated and poorly thought out compared to other places I've been recently. A few modern high speed chairs or gondolas would make so much difference to this place and it would maybe allow them to keeps the links open when the wind gets above a strong breeze or when it is actually snowing.I do like this place, but it could be SO much better!"
182,Great Ski Area,"The resort insists on charging for a ski bus - 2 euros. Everywhere else I have been this type of transport is free.The pistes are poorly maintained, lifts are closed with just a stiff breeze - meaning very few runs become available.The town itself is great, however I don't go on a ski holiday for the architecture"
183,excellent skiing,"Spent a week staying in Sestriere to ski.  We're from California, and never saw another American.  The people and scenery were amazing: friendly, low-key and extremely hospitable. The interconnect of 8 separate areas was fairly negotiable, all but for the weather pattern while we were there.  Did get over to Sauze D'Ouix, which was spectacular, especially at the higher elevations.  A bit more snow, and the off-piste would have been fabulous, but we had weather, with some fox and wind that confined us pretty much to Sestriere's area.  Still, had a great time, EZ to get to from Torino, and very close to Alba, in the heart of the Lange, and Alba's a great town to spend a few days at wineries, in the charming town and sightseeing.  Also, as a bonus, it's  a fairly short drive to the Mediterranean to unwind in Rapallo, Santa Margherita and Portofino, which were totally uncrowded in late winter/early spring.  Oh, and there's the food........after all, it IS Italy.We really loved the visit to Italy's western Alps."
184,2nd time to this ski area - wonderful,"Not good off piste conditions but on piste the conditions were perfect, kept in great condition.No helmet no snow park"
185,Amazing ski and surroundings,Been here at peak times and rarely suffer with long lift queues.  Something for everyone from learners through to powder hounds.
186,What a Gem!!,"This is a great ski area.Plus points: -It's vast! On a good day, some of the runs (particularly the reds) and easy to access off-piste are amazing. Red 79 down to Sansicario is a particular favourite.It's really spectacular and varied terrain.People in Sauze are very friendly, bars and restaurants are great but not mental!The piste-side restaurants are plentiful and varied.Bad points: -Some of the lifts are a bit inadequate with weird connections and there are still some hideous drags. If you're getting out of Sauze the 2 man up to Fraiteve can be a real pain.It's fairly low so conditions can be slushy. I've always found somewhere good though...It's quite hard to get between areas...Sauze to Montgenevre is a proper expedition! The ski busses are random and there's no connection between valleys. When you know this, it kind of adds to the charm though.Few parks.It's also good in the summer for MTBs or walking. Lots of top notch tracks to have a go at.It's great - go for it!"
187,Big Resort with Old Infrastructure,"Sauze has easy access to the Milky Way though the lifts get closed in high winds and you can get stuck on the wrong side of the mountain, so check the forecast. When the weather is good the skiing is excellent with a wide variety of high mountain and tree lined runs. The lower slopes are sheltered when the wind is blowing on the top. Mountain restaurants are varied and actually cheap. Unbelivable value when compared to France. In Feb there were no lift queues during the week and no more than 10 minutes for the main access lifts on Saturday. Skiing 6+ hours per day for a week we did not manage every run covered by the lift pass. A very enjoyable experience"
188,First Ski Trip,"As stated on here not for beginners, mainly red with a few hard to find blues never saw a green. Apre ski was non existent. Lift system was old but good with no queues (march 2013). Good skiing to be had with plenty of long reds just needs a decent piste map as the one they have is awful!"
189,Perhaps the best snow area yet!!,The ski area and how it is run is superb. the area is amazing! plenty to do as a beginner and even more to do if you are an intermediate/advanced!
190,A great area but not without a few niggles,"Just returned from an Easter ski trip with the family that includes a 5 and 8 yr old that have never skied before.This is perfect for everyone unless you are an expert that only does black runs!Ski school was great for the kids and fun too........especially for us as we could go off and ski for 3 hours without them, which was brilliant. We all met up afterwards with non skiing grandparents for lunch together on the mountain and then we skied together in the afternoon.By the end of the week we managed to ski most reds and one black run as a family.........clearly they were quick learners, even if the soft afternoon snow helped by 'slowing' things down a bit but the kids didn't need to know that!Lovely town and would return anytime.Only downside was we were skiing very late in the season so slushy now after lunchtime but that's our problem and not the resorts fault.Everything did not seem as expensive as I was expecting.....result!"
191,Half-term ski holiday,"I've been to a few ski areas in Europe in my time and excluding Bulgaria, this is the most disappointing. It has a lot of potential as the ski area is huge, depending on the slope and the time of day the skiing can be great too. But the big issue is the lift system is poorly thought out, you spend so much time on lifts trying to get any where, it takes four lifts and two short runs to get to the top of Sauze D'Oulx. Doing the trek across the ski area will mean you spend most of your time on lifts. Added to that the lifts are dated and there is only one main gondola in resort, its a slow process. A key area linker lift should not be a two man. I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't warn others against the resort, but it's certainly not up there with the best."
192,Large ski area; many red slopes,"Unreal. My ski school instructor Marco was fantastic. The  mountain views were terrific. Everyone in the hotels, restaurants, shops & bars were extremely friendly & helpful. Would absolutely return here in an instant. Wonderful place"
193,The Old Lifts are gone,"Went 5th-13th January. Piste conditions were excellent every day, except for the last day when it was much colder and the snow machines were on. Good variety of slopes, though I found that the Sauze slopes were too easy, i.e. some of the blacks were more like reds etc. The slopes in Sestriere were much more challenging, that was my favourite place to ski. We were told that the slopes in Montgenevre in France were the best, though it takes a lot of travelling from Sauze. Sadly, on the Friday when we planned to go there, it was very windy and the lifts were closed. Still, it general, great slopes, good lifts and not too busy! Enjoyed it, would definitely go back."
194,Terrific family ski holiday,"Because of the well prepared pistes and the fantastic wether conditions it was a pleasure of being here. It was not so busy as Austria, not so French as French can be. Good food and wine in combination with snow!"
195,Skied 'The Milky Way' Feb 2014,"If you are lucky and the snow falls during your stay- there are endless off piste options.The lifts are old and some of them slow, therefore it takes a long time to reach other parts of the huge resort."
196,Excellent snow - poor piste maps with out of date signs,"Via Lattea is a huge area consisting of four towns in Italy and one in France. In Italy there are Sauze d'Oulx (SO), Sestiere (S), San Sicario (SS) and Claviere (C); in France - Montgenevre (M).All are interconnected by ski lifts. It means interconnected more in theory than in practice; in many cases moving from one to another place is not easy. Apart from two modern gondolas (connecting S-town with top points of pistes in skiing areas of SO and SS) all other lifs are obsolate. As far as I know gondolas were built for Olympic Games 2006, lifts are much older and sometimes very slow. Having stayed twice in SO and once in S and SS each I have never tried to visit C or M. Those who made such a trip recommended going by bus or taxi, as much easier and faster than skiing.Via Lattea offers a broad choice for skiers, from beginners to experienced; experts have just a few pistes in S (Olympic) and one in SO (Canale Colo), the latter being really difficult both on ascent (with help of extremely steep drag lift) and descent (moguls). In general pistes are not difficult, many of the red being blue in fact (including very nice Pista Olimpica Feminine in SS). All centres may be recommended for family skiing. There are many kid-parks, schools and slopes for small children and in SO and SS you may ski together with kids of ca 10y on almost all pistes (less so in S). From peaks and slopes you have magnificent views in all centres. As to the towns my favorite is SO. It was a normal town to which all the hotels have been just added in harmony. If you do not ski walking in the old part is nice and interesting. Everything is in an easy access. There are plenty of pubs, restaurants and other points of after-ski recreation. It is patronized by English-speaking tourists. In the crowd of British and Irish an occasional South African appears as well! S is a large, modern ski centre, SS - just a few hotels and literally nothing else.Changing all these places into a skiing area was, apparently, the idea of Giovanni Agnelli, founder of the FIAT motor company, who in early 1930-ties, wanted to offer the ""gilded youth"" of Turin a sporting alternative to less healthy town recreation. Thanks to him you have now both at the same place."
197,Loadsa Snow,Loved Italy. Loved Sauze D’Oulx.We were lucky with both the snow and the weather.Milky Way a great expanse to explore.
198,Best Ski area ive been too,Liked the variety of slopes in Sauze D'Oulx and Sestriere and Sansicario. Links across to Claviere took about 90 minutes sitting in chairs/gondolas - so although linked took a long time.
199,Poor piste maintenance,"I skied mostly in Sauze D'Oulx and Sestriere.  It's really nice.  Majority of trails are Blue and Red, so if you're not an expert skier, there is no risk of accidentially getting on a Black trail."
200,Ski lifts need some planned upgrades,"I've been skiing the area for 8 years and this was the worst year so far.  Yes the weather was bad at times but not as bad as I've seen it in previous years.  The lift company doesn't seem to care about the visiting tourist and they seem to close lift at the slightest sign of a bit of wind.  This has been a gradual decline over the last 4 years and this year was by far the worst.  There needs to be a massive investment in new faster and more efficent lifts for the area to keep up with other resorts.  The piste's are badly groomed with some odd ruts down the centre which in bad visibility can really catch you out.  There are also occasional large lumps of ice on the on the slopes first thing in the morning which If you are travelling at speed are lethal.  Some slopes are not even groomed, well not until the weekend when the locals arrive.  There seem to be lifts that are closed during the week but then open at the weekend, again when the locals arrive.  If you pay for a full area lift pass then you should be able to ski the whole area.  Why is it the French side of this area manages to stay open but the Italian side only has half the lifts working.  I used to love this area but after this year I'm moving on until they get there act together.  Sorry Vialattea but you need to up your game or loose out."
201,Nice skiing :-),Ideal for intermediates with miles of well-groomed pistes. Not that many easy blue runs for complete beginners.
202,Nice but could use some updating on connections,"we stayed at Sauze last week - it was so quite on the pistes.  The snow was seriously topped up 19-1-13 which should see the milky way through for another few weeks.  The Italians were so helpfull both on the mountain and in the villages. Sauze might benefit from a few more chair lifts to replace the dreaded drags!  A ""vin chaud"" typically cost 3 euros - much cheaper than France!"
203,Ski-ing,"We have been here for the past 5 years - absolutely love it.  Not a beginners resort as most of the runs are reds/blacks, but nothing too difficult - so great for average skiers.  Great nightlife - bars really good fun and great variety of restaurants."
204,Skiing heaven,"Having not gone here to ski since I started nearly 30 years ago I was pleasantly surprised how much better the area is than it's reputation for poor snow and slow lifts. It is quite a big area, enough to keep even diehard skiers busy for a week and has that Italian feel which is friendly and not overpriced. Skiing is generally good with a mix of treeline and above so something for all weathers. Piste grading is a little overdone - blues are greens, reds are blues and blacks are red. Plenty of good places to eat at not silly prices. Give it a go and see what you think - I will be back."
205,can`t wait for next year,SIX MOST WONDERFUL DAYS OF FULL ON SKI ACTION.There are enough runs to challenge the best of skiers and enough mountain cafes and restaurants to keep you fed and watered too.THE SKIING down to San Sicario ....off to the left...is amazing. Very few people bother with the lesser routes and off times you can ski solo.AMAZING SPOT.Stay up in Sportinia.
206,Paradise for Intermediate skiers,"Visited for a week on a package over new year . Desperate lack of snow here , and the commune seem reluctant to use the snow cannons . 90% of runs closed .Meanwhile half an hour down the road at Montgenevre there was loads of snow      ( machine made ).Local Italians were friendly and the mountain-side food was good value.It started to snow heavily on our last day !"
207,Great ski holiday in Sauze Doulx,"This was my first time ever skiing and would definitely recommend it to any beginners.Sauze D’Oulx  We started by just skiing freely down the small (green,if you like) slopes and found no trouble at all. There are blue/red slopes that are perfect and not too crowded. There is a range of restaurants that sell lovely food. We went skiing here for 4/5 days and loved it. You could ski down to our hotel which was also very convenient.Sestriere We went here for the remaining 1 day. Would recommend for advanced skiers but still decent runs for beginners/intermediates. The food was also good here but think the service was a little better at Sauze d’Oulx. More people here too but not overly populated.Both areas had a good lift system and I experienced no faults/issues. Would definitely return."
208,Chairlift Joke,The ski area was so large a week is not long enough.The only thing i did not like about it was the hill you had to get up to get to the ski lift
209,Beautiful views and enjoyable intermediate terrain,"Just come back from a week skiing here.  Best way to describe my skiing is I like going as fast as I can on reds.  Not many people go past me (one or two in a week maybe).  Blacks are too steep to get any real speed up.As everyone will have already said, the lifts are slow and not covered.  However, we've just come back from half term week and we never queued for more than 3 minutes, mostly we skied on to a lift.Around Sauze there is a mix of road width runs through trees and wider pistes that are tree lined.  plenty of places to eat and drink. The pistes aren't all bashed every night.  Also they will use the sprayers but not bash or mark the big mounds of snow/ice that they form.  A little dangerous judging by the increase of the stretchers and blues and twos we saw after they did this.The runs down to Sansicario we more of the same.Setstriere didn't really grab me.  Not enough long sustained runs for my liking, despite them making a big deal about the Olympics.  I remember it being much more fun in 2008.The best place for me was Borgata.  Lots of big, wide, long, sustained reds.  I could of spent the whole week here.Don't bother going over to Claviere, or France.  It's not worth it.  The runs are not as good and the skiing is better over in Sauze and Borgata.  And there are no cafes.  You don't realise it until you go somewhere else, but in Sauze, there are opportunities to stop and get a drink everywhere.Wife and daugher, who are cautious said there wasn't much for them.  Blues where too slow and the Reds too much.  Also, it doesn't look like there are many nursery slopesWe'd go back again."
210,Milky Way...,We were pleased with a sunny week at February 2019. We were all tanned after week and slopes were getting rocky... Skiis went out of shape on this trip and no off-piste which we had been wishing for. Good luck with weather but bad as there was no fresh snow ;)
211,"Beautiful place, lots to do in the summer!","From our base in Sauze D'Oulx we found it very easy to access the majority of slopes in the Vialattea and were lucky that the slopes were not overly crowded and we rarely had to queue for lifts. When you do have to queue though be aware that there are no manners and your skiis/snowboard will get trodden all over! The condition of the slopes was excellent, although lower down it was a little sketchy but could be avoided by staying higher. The mountain restaurants have the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted!!"
212,Great Mountain Range,"OK the title of the review is my main gripe with this excellent ski resort. We tried to avoid all the school mid terms (3 weeks in all) and we landed slap bang in the middle of Carnivale !! mayhem at the lifts for 4 out of our six days holidays. The resort itself is faultless great skiing once you get up the mountain, there is a link to Sestriere that suffers from warm weather that could do with a few snow cannons to freshen up,  but the apres ski in Sauze is excellent. The ski hire shops are OK the level of equipment we hired was a little dated but sufficed for the bargains we went after. Not great resort for beginners, but having said that I could not recommend the Ski Schools enough excellent instructors with great patience with complete beginners. Yes I would go back at a different time of year, and hopefully in the coming years they'll upgrade to a gondola from Town to Sportinia, and snow cannons on the Sestriere side."
213,Top class Skiing,"The downside to skiing here is the lifts, some of which need upgrading- as an example the one from the sportina area out of Sauze is only a 4 man chair lift, but is fed by 2 4 man lifts which creates a bottleneck during busy periods. The upside is the access to the milky way and the relatively inexpensive area lift pass. There are numerour reds to test intermediate skiers from wide open ones to runs up top to narrower more technical ones down tnrough the trees. Red 12 feeds all the way down to Jeauvensau, but my favourites are over the other side like 2000 and red 29 which are often deserted. It's also worth travelling further across the milky way to san secario and sestriere where the Turin Olympics were held to try out the mens and ladies runs if you have the nerve and ability."
214,Great Ski Area,"Not really suitable for beginners, but awesome if you are okay with easy reds and higher. Snow conditions were generally good, some of the lifts were rather slow, but the queues were manageable even at new-year."
215,Excellent snow,"We had a big dump of snow just before we arrived so the skiing was wonderful, tempered only by poor visibility on a few days. Massive choice of beautiful slopes and we'll be back to do it again in 2018"
216,Great ski area,"I am very disappointed with the lift system, piste grooming and poor management of lifts in the area. We stayed in Sestriere.  This village has a lot of accommodation. But there are really only 2 lifts (a 4 man chair and a 8 man telecabin) to service the whole village. I should also mention the double button lift - Baby SX (but lift company only decided to run 1 button). Sadly, these lifts are old, slow and not reliable. We spend more time queuing for the lifts while admiring the empty piste. Telecabin Sestriere Fraiteve will come to a stop in a simple gust of wind (perhaps 25mph). Piste grooming is poor. Beware of the cricket ball size boulders, and the steps across the piste! Some lift (despite their age) are not even opened, when the adjacent lift suffers some serious queuing. Over the San Sicario side, the key link back to Sestriere is another double button, follow by a short - one person at a time - travellator (skis and board off please). Key link from Sauze d'Oulx is a 2 man chair (single occupancy is quite often).On the other hand, on and off mountain restaurants / cafes are serving good quality food."
217,Great Ski Area,"We stayed in Sauze d'oulx for 4 weeks at the end of February - March and have had the best time. We're up on the mountain every second day. Vialattea is a great snow mountain, so many runs, so many towns to visit, you need at least a week to really take advantage of all the options! Great apreski, heaps of bars with happy hour from 4-7. Lots of great restaurants and places to stop on the mountain for food and drinks. Must visit!"
218,the vialattea is excellent,"My wife fell in the bowl. I was in front and before I could get to her on next lift she was already being attended to by marshals. To say they were fantastic is an understatement. She needed to be airlifted to hospital nr Turin and all sorted for E202. Hospital was busy but x ray and ct scan (3 fractures to pelvis) all sorted on ECHC card and I got her home thanks to local taxi drivers - all again excellent. A star missing only because link to Sestriere was blacks only - with warnings only for expert skiers, when decent intermediaries would have no bother really (we didn’t). Been to Sauze about 15x and will be back - this was first accident and no one was to blame, but local Italians were out of this world, including Gabrielle from Hotel Martin."
219,Vast varied ski area,"After checking all the Ski Resorts through Europe, we decided to spend a week in La Vialattea. The prices for the ski lifts are reasonable, and, in addition the staff provides a good service. There are lots of slopes and the quality of the snow was simply great.In other hand, due to the bad weather conditions, the link (chairlifts) of the slopes of Sauze d'Oulx with Sestriere was closed for 2 days which ruin partially our holidays because we had to ski in Sauze for that time. When they re opened our frustration, due to the bad experience with the weather, simply passed and we spend the next two days discovering the slopes at Sestriere.When we noticed, that we had skied only a quarter of the total of the slopes was late already... our ski holidays were finished. Therefore, in the future, if we come back we will book, at least, 10 days or more.Regarding the facilities, the chairlifts are mostly well maintained, the signage is enough for don't get lost and the canyons provide an extra layer of snow in strategic places.Overall, A nice and affordable ski holidays with friendly people everywhere."
220,Large ski resort,"This was our first visit to sauze as we usually  go to the french Alpes. We got a good deal so went with an open mind via crystal ski. I have mixed opinions but overall this was definitely a value for money holiday.Here goes and I hope my feedback is given consideration. Firstly the town shuttle bus is necessary unless you want to walk uphill all week, but paying eight euro for a pass where most resorts offer free travel is a bit dated. A big problem I have is the amount of vehicles driving through the town constantly and at speed, please make a pedestrian area for safety. Now the pistes! Generally very good but definitely not a place for beginners as most runs back to resort funnel into for some reason a narrow blue to clotes lift, very icy and rutted by the end of day. Areas that money needs investing in is the top of colo chair where the only way to return is a long narrow and quite tricky blue, difficult even for the competent skier:border or the black steep piste. I think the piste needs re working in this area. If you are a border and drop over to the Olympic run it can get awkward to get back over if you are not experienced at riding a long button lift, the only other option is to walk over the hill before riding down to mod station and catching the gondola back up to the top.Overall a good experience but certainly the amount of traffic in resort makes me question if I would return. One very last comment is please will someone sort out the amount of dog faeces That is very noticeable and prevent people from allowing their animals to do this unless cleaning up afterwards."
221,Great skiing area,"We really enjoyed our short break to Sauze. We have never skied in Italy and as a family of four this resort was just perfect for us. We are intermediate skiers and i would probably recommend Sauze to a confident beginner/ intermediate skier rather than a first timer. There is a great variety of runs and the queues by Australian standards very not too bad and fast moving. The village itself is so pretty with an array of lovely shops, great restaurants and bars. One highlight for us was the nigh torch ski through the actual streets...picture book material. We  did book a private instructor for the first day which was fantastic....not only for a refresher having not skied for a few years but it provided a great way to learn about the different runs/ areas."
222,Great,The snow was brilliant. THe lifts are slow and busy and liable to break down. The restaurants are good and cheap up the mountain. No good for inexperienced skiers
223,Amazing.,"Great pistes for all, half empty Christmas Day and Boxing Day and weekdays, but busy at weekends when it is best to stay on the drag lifts where the tree lined runs are good. Final run back into Clotes very icy most of the week, be careful!"
224,Sauze at Christmas,"Spent 2 glorious weeks in Sauze d'oulx, Via Lattea...although the season's snowfall was considerably less than all had hoped for, I enjoyed myself all the same! On my first w/end it snowed and resulted in the opening up of more lifts and runs so I was always able to find new runs, on and off-piste to keep me entertained. Eydallin Sports at the Clotes lift kitted me out with some of the newest skis/poles & boots I've ever had as hire equipment, & all at a seemingly ridiculously reduced price! All in all, & despite its reputation as ""the Ibiza of the Alps""(actually...all the British made it easy to ask around for info on everything!), Via Lattea was more than I hoped for...& I will be returning first chance I get..."
225,Great skiing,"After many years on Alpes, this season we decided to try Via Lattea. We have to say that it was not a good decision. The only reason to choose this ski area might be if you live less than one hour from there. Otherwise, go to Dolomiti, where they know how to manage a ski area.Here the summary: although recognizing that the year is short in snow, it is unbelievable that only 2 slopes are opened at Sauze, even after 2 full nights snowing. They are not shooting artificial snow, with temperature well below 0, maybe to save water and money (on Dolomiti, with same temperature vs altitude profile, almost all slopes are opened since mid december, even if no natural snow at all). They don't press the snow in the night or anyway do it poorly, so resulting that at Sportinia, after one night snowing, half of the only open slope was already icy and half had grass and stones at noon! On Sunday jan 3rd we queued 40 minutes to get the day skipass, despite not more than 10 persons/families in the line, because they register manually every child (yes, by asking parents to fill a full form with all data!!), so every family takes 5-10 minutes! And they want 16 euro to ski practically on a single slope. Other interesting details: the lifts are mostly obsolete if compared to the last standards; parking in Sauze costs 4.50 euro but works only if you have everything in coins (in this century!).As result of this situation, we used to go to Montgenevre (20 km, in France) to find good slopes and lifts. It is sad to be obliged to cross the border for an italian family in Italy on Alpes, but this is the reality.So, whoever can compare with other ski areas can see the difference and take the right choice. Hopefully, this review can be helpful if someone has hesitations.Still some days in the area...hopefully things will get better...."
226,worst piste map in the world,"We had skii'd the Vialattea a few years agoe, but this New Year the conditions were absolutely superb. We stayed in Jouvencaeux which is below the Sportinia area and were able to ski in/out. One of our better skiing experiences and we've been doing it twice a year for 15 years. Just had one incident where we think one of our groups skis were taken in error. I would hate to think they were stolen, it's not the done thing amonst fellow skiers  / boarders wherever in the world they come from. The 'Piste' Police were very helpful and helped to sort things out and get us back from Sestriere to Jouvencaux. We had to pay out for the skiis at the hire shop. Thank goodness for Travel insurance - make sure you're covered for ski theft! It doesn't happen often, but anything is possible."
227,Beware ski pass scam,"we had a fantastic week - bright blue skies, sun shining and perfect snow. Only a bit slushy later on but beats working!The area is very pretty - lots of variation can ski to Sestriere, Claviere, Sansicario - get the bus to Montgenevre as if you ski you'll have to ski back as soon as you get there.If you've never tried it - you don't know what you're missing - skiing in Italy is friendly and fun"
228,Winter Wonderland,"Just to begin on a positive note, the views and mountains are beautiful and there is some really nice food places on the mountain (Orso Restaurant). We just spent a week skiing in Sauze d'Oulx and the beginning of the week was way to Icy and the second bit of the week was way to Snowy. Wasn't piste bashed properly, you'd get off your skis and fall through about half a foot of snow. When the snow came in they closed half of the slopes instead of bashing them, a lot of lifts were closed for the entire week so couldn't get up half of the mountain.Lifts look like they need a face lift, hard, cold and old looking. Alot of the maps were off piste so you had to wade through thick snow or to the edge of cliffs to see them.Awful for beginners, hardly any blues and all red.Wouldn't go again unfortunately"
229,Lovely scenery and large ski area,"Our experience of the area was based at Sestriere which forms part of the Milky Way or Vialattea area as it is known in Italy, together with Sansicario and Sauze D’Oulx which are easily accessible by chairlift.  The area lift pass was 180 Euros for 6 days in 2012 and also covered Cesana, Clavier (both Italy) and Montgenevre (in France) however the links to these other three areas by lift and piste are lengthy and we only ventured to the latter on a coach trip for the day.Sestriere the town is reasonably large and although not particularly attractive to look at it has plenty of amenities. The surrounding slopes and countryside by contrast are quite scenic with many sections of the piste bordered with woodland.   In terms of lifts, when travelling between Sestriere, Sansicario and Sauze D’Oulx it is straightforward - the gondola style lift operates from near the Olympic Village end of Sestriere, up to Mount Fraitteve where you can then ski into the other two areas.  If you are staying at the opposite end of Sestriere (as we did, at Hotel Du Col) you can catch a lift up the local slopes and ski down to the Olympic Village side as a warm up.  On the return it is possible sometimes to ski back over to Sestriere from Sansicario/Sauze D’Oulx however when we were there in early March 2012 the lower parts of the piste had lots of exposed rock and from our vantage point on the lift we could see skiers were having a nightmare picking their way down - best to check conditions before attempting it - and preferably use hired skis! The lifts seldom, if ever, had queues but the piste map and the signs were not particularly easy to follow in my experience - some would argue however that I don’t have a sense of direction!  All the more reason for a decent map in my opinion.The local slopes at Sestriere are divided between Mt Sises facing the town and Mt Motta, above Borgata, which has more runs.  The huge majority of these are graded red, with a few blacks, including the men’s Olympic downhill from 2006.  When we visited, the mogul field at Sises served by a drag lift, was closed.  That is the most difficult run in that area and the others were fine for confident experienced skiers.  At Motta there are a number of rolling reds which we were able to speed down first thing in the morning before these became busy.  In this area, run 9 was not a favourite with some in our group and it obtained a bit of a reputation as being difficult although personally I didn’t think it was too bad.  (Some cautious skiers took fright and got stuck at a steeper, icy section during our visits and created an additional hazard themselves by obstructing the piste).  As if to confirm that the area is patrolled, we were “moved on” by ski patrol when we were re-grouping at the base of this section - the danger being out-of-control skiers crashing into us.Sansicario has longer red runs and a few blacks, including the women’s Olympic downhill and the area was quite attractive scenery wise.Sauze D’Oulx again had mostly red runs, some of which (over in the extreme edge of the map) were served by drag lifts.  This area, covered by the tows at Tuassieres and Moncrons was quieter when we visited and had some nice runs coming through woodland.  The more adventurous skiers in our group spent a lot of time off piste between trees over all the areas including this one in the absence of difficult blacks or other more testing slopes.  We were also attracted at the time due to low visibility due to falling snow.There were no beginners or early intermediates in our group so I couldn’t give feedback on that aspect other than to mention that there were a few wide gentler slopes near the base at Sestriere.In terms of mountain restaurants we tried quite a few - Il Capret (not marked on the piste map) near the Nouva Nube chair in Borgata  had decent food and a terrace which caught the sun at lunchtime; Lou Brachettes, near the base of the Chisonetto-Bachetta chair, unusually had benches on the terrace clad with animal skins for warmth; Soleil Boeuf at Sansicario was an attractive spot to take a coffee break and we had a few meals at the seated area in the rear of Alpette on poor weather days (top of the Garnel chair) which were ok.  In Sauze D’Oulx we had hot drinks (in plastic cups!) beneath Ristorante Il Capricorno just before the Lago Nero chair which gave shelter from the snow and a good view of the slopes. Our day to Montgenevre, over in France, was well worth the visit.  For a warm up we skied down the blue runs Alpet and Pharo which were reached via a long slowish drag lift after coming off the Chalvet gondola. You could speed down these first thing in the morning, go across the bridge over the road to the Pralial chair and then down the red La Mandarine and the black Chuvet run (aka La Stade de Slalom) which we enjoyed so much we went down twice.  Before coming down the wide black at L’ Observatoire there were good views towards Briancon and the remains of an old fort and we also enjoyed the reds at Les Pres and Les Sources off the L’Alp chair.  Lunch was back down in the village at “Le Capitaine” on the decking. (Take care here - I had a fall in the style of Del Boy when I stepped into mid air getting up from my seat having forgotten that the decking was terraced next to me!  Not only was it embarrassing but I tested my hip bone severely).  Fortunately the food here was very good - I had omelette and chips.   To finish the day we got the exposed, cold, two man Chalvet chair off the Chalvet gondola and raced down La Combe du Loup onto Chalvet (both red) joined the blue Pharo and crossed over the bridge again to revisit runs in the Gondrans sector.  The black 3 Fourneous run is not visible from the top of the Chalvet chair and as it was hardpacked on the piste we didn’t venture down it - especially when we thought that the only way back was to come up a very steep and long drag lift alongside the run.  We’re not sure if this is correct and you may be able to ski out onto the blue Pharo run.  In the afternoon the bottom of the Pharo run had become heavy with slush.  That apart the runs we experienced were straightforward with no surprises (unlike the decking at Le Capitaine), the area was generally quiet, scenic and there was plenty to keep us interested for the day.  Altogether, based in Sestriere and having the whole Milky Way or Vialattea area to ski provided us with plenty of variety for 5 days - one day was a write-off due to poor weather."
230,5th March 2013 snow conditions excellent,"Great skiing even though the temp was near 20 degrees for most of the week, the pistes held up well down to sportinia, sestriere skied really well too, what little snow they get they really look after"
231,Huge ski area,"This area ticked a few boxes for us.  lots of sun, lots of tree lined runs and lots of cruising.  The lift system is not the most modern but our major gripe was toilets.  Many mountain restaurants just had holes in the ground.  I was glad I was a man."
232,Great slopes,"Based in Sauze d'Oulz we had the option of two lifts in the morning. The Clotes is the quietest but does not get you to the top of the mountain, even after the change at the midway point. The other lift is the Sportinia but the mid point change is where the ski schools meet so stay clear around 10am as it gets very busy.The runs to the left of the ski area were not well pisted due to the poor weather we had. There is only one chair lift that side with two long button lifts to get you back up. The chair lift is supposed to be new but is just a three person chair. Overall the lifts were OK but there were no bubbles or covered chair lifts. I think the Italians like the harder life. The area generally is mostly red runs and whilst nit that challenging if you like blues then get across to Sestriere.To get to Sestriere or Sansicario take the Sportinia and go to the top. Ski down to chair lift 12 and up over the mountain. This chair was closed due to wind for 4 days. Opened for the last two days and we managed to get to Sansicario. Very busy queues here so we got out quick and skied to Sestriere. Try the ladies Olympic downhill to the bottom. Some very nice runs at Sestriere. Try Blue 68 from the top or red 3.To get back is easy as you take the bubble lift back to the top of the mountain."
233,Skiing,"Just to let anyone who is on their way here or planning a last minute trip to Sauze d'Oulx and Milky way or Vialattea ski area.Conditions are excellent, snow forecast over the next few days, yesterday bright blue clear skies, crusted powder on the side of the piste or off piste, well groomed packed snow on all piste. Runs down to the village to clotes perfect, to sportinia perfect to Jouvenceaux perfect.All links openDaily updates on events, apres, ski lifts open on Facebook Ski Initaly, your best in resort guide from sauze d'oulx also offering wicked ski extra deals"
234,extensive runs,"I've been travelling to Vialattea ski area from January each weekend. I've already been there years ago, and I stll find the entire place lovely, especially the Sansicario and the Montiluna areas. With 320 km slopes, the Italian Vialattea is one of the largest ski areas in Europe, taken with the French side it makes up 400 kms. Quite enough for fun. Lovely places for accomodation or eating out, but away from fashionable Sestriere which is expensive. Search the smaller villages."
235,Extensive skiing area,"I stayed in Sauze in February with my son who was a beginner. It is not ideal, for beginners, as you need to pass a red piste to get to the nursery slopes in Sportinia. Additionally, the infrastructure is a little dated; there are not many telecabins, mainly chairlifts. The snow on the pistes was very good in most places we went, however it can be icy occasionally in some areas of piste. On a good note, most restaurants in the slopes are delicious. Also, many slopes are very scenic and enjoyable to ski down.On the whole, I would recommend skiing in Via Lattea."
236,Milky Way,"We were extremely lucky with the weather and snow conditions. It had just snowed a meter of fresh snow and all of the slopes were open. Sun was shining the whole week. Slopes were in very good condition. Ski lifts are a bit slow but if you are not in a hurry, it's not a problem. Good selection for various kinds of slopes, also for beginners. The black slopes are not very challenging."
237,great ski area,"Booked a week in Sauze D'oulx 31/01/2016, snow conditions were unfavourable and you cannot predict the weather, however found the facilities in Sauze out dated. Internet impressed me with the amount of runs open for snow machine groomed(139 at time of booking), however don't be fooled once arrived this proved inaccurate as possibly 9 runs were open in Sauze D'oulx whilst the other 130 were inaccessible as they were in surrounding areas. Main Link was closed all week made me feel like a trapped rat on the Sauze d'oulx side of the mountain. Snow far better maintained in Claviere and Sestriere, after conversations with a member of ski club he was of the opinion lift closed on purpose to allow people to spend more money in Sauze D'oulx rather then make there way to better groomed snow.This from a business point of view may be a great idea but as a tourist made me feel cheated and out of pocket. Neilson Tour operator placed extra buses to Montegenevre  on most days, however felt this was pointless as with the Area Lift pass you only receive one days skiing in France, and this would of meant shelling out an extra £23 a day to ski. If buses were provided to Sestriere and other places in the milky way the holiday could have been saved however Just feel dissapointed with Sauze d'oulx. I recommend booking Sauze D'oulx once the snow has fallen because with the Snow this place is amazing value for money, however without the snow this place becomes a ridiculously small area to ski. Unless the Lift operators or Tour operators seriously pull their Finger out this place is going to become an awful place to ski for future winters to come. So to summarise my review Sauze d'oulx is out dated but with a sufficient amount of snow is an excellent place to ski, however if like me you arrive on a week where the area needs to rely on it's snow machines, look at spending more money on somewhere in the northern alps, as the lack of TLC on the mountain will leave a distaste in your mouth."
238,Great intermediate skiing,"Other reviewers have said that the runs are strangely classified and I agree!  There are very few blue runs and the few that there are are not easy - by the mountain edge with no barrier - or the one very long one we found. However, the reds are mainly wide and not very challenging - perhaps just one was a bit chopped up, and moguls were beginning to form..  Most reds were red/blue, with steep sections in part.  As the others said, perfect for good intermediates.  The lifts were old but ok.  There was so much snow which was amazing and the sun shone - apparently the best week of the season - and apart from the Friday - the slopes were empty!The village is small but traditional and beautiful."
239,Sauze D'oulx Italy,It's been a difficult season for the lift company with the amount of early snow being poor. Whilst I was here for a week we had around 2ft of fresh snow including some the week before we arrived. The lift company were very slow on getting pistes & lifts open. Until Friday night when the Italians were coming for the weekend. The opened 12 extra pistes for Saturday morning which I thought was very poor taste. I think the lift company needs to be very careful doing things like this as the Milky Way has struggled with snow last couple of years & if people see the lift company can't be bothered to try & get max amounts of lift & pistes open for holiday makers people will stop coming here which would be very sad. So I say to the lift company up your game & treat holiday makers the same as the Italians we all pay the same money!
240,sauze2013,"We skied the last week of the season, luckily there had been a huge dump of snow.around a third of the resort was closed, however that was reflected in the lift pass price.The runs were enjoyable but not over taxing.Coffee stops were good value and served tasty food. Didn't feel ripped off. The bars on the mountain may be low key they are certainly not follie douce, Krazy kangaroo or even Nederheutte.The major downside to this resort is the lack of investment, still relying on steep poma lifts and the chair lifts were slow with no snow/wind covers, even though we enjoyed Vialatea I would not visit in the depths of winter as it will be bitter and uncomfortable on the lifts.The resort seriously needs updating. Give it a few more years and it will certainly be past it. Pity."
241,large skiing area and well linked,We bought two ski passes with a credit card. We had not moved away from the vendors 'window' when we discovered only a single ticket had been given to us. No doubt it was retained and then sold for cash. We had to pay for three tickets for the two of us. One hundred and ten euros for one day skiing. Management had no interest in helping us.
242,"Milky Way, great fun for all","I skied here with a ski group in March 2013.  Our guide, Davide, made the experience for us.  This was my first ski experience after a serious injury the previous year - so I was being cautious and Davide had our group fully appreciating the mountain on an intermediate level - which suited me just fine.  We covered a range of trails and this ended up being the longest distance and longest day I had ever skied - quite the comeback!  Scenery was beautiful.  Having a guide was the key to avoiding crowds and getting to the best snow and places to eat and drink.  A memorable experience."
243,Loads of Blues and Reds - but not many real blacks,"Great snow conditions in the Sauze d'oulx, Sansicario, Sestriere area in early February. Fantastic slopes which are suited more for intermediate skiers to advanced, including some good black slopes too. Ski school instructors are very friendly people too!"
244,excellent,If it wasn't for the snow and the stunning skiing conditions we wouldn't have bothered.....the queues at chair lift were  ridiculous!!! long and lengthy!! would love to say it was worth it.
245,"fantastic slopes, snow and hospitality","We just skied there for 8 days.  To be fair, there was a generous snowfall on night 2 of our stay, which made things heavenly, but even without that, super fun.  What's so fun?I have kids, they are excellent skiers, and I have nieces, who are young and less skilled.  All 4 of them had a blast going off the side of the piste around the tree or trees and the odd jump and bits of powder.  So much to be skied between the pistes, most of it not all to steep, and trees spaced far enough apart that it isn't to knarly.  A couple of times we followed a ski instructor to discover little unmarked and tracked trails.  Feels like Disneyland on ski's.  Can't wait to go back!"
246,Best pistes,"This for many of us in a group of 27 was a return visit to Via Lattea, again based at Sestriere which is the largest of the resorts in this area.  The others are Sauze D’Oulx, Sansicario, Cesana and Claviere in Italy and Montgenevre across the French border.  Access by lifts is straightforward between Sestriere, Sauze D’Oulx and Sansicario provided they are operating which they weren‘t on a couple of days during our stay.  We didn’t venture to either Cesana or Claviere although we did take a day trip to Montgenevre with Crystal Ski - a 25 minute coach journey at €20 per head.  I purchased the full area ski pass in advance of departure from the UK for £150/€173 (when packaged with ski carriage) against availability in the resort at €196 for 1 week. Although there were times when wind speed was definitely a factor (we travelled on the Fraiteve-Sestriere gondola in high winds and it worryingly stopped on several occasions) it did appear that lifts were not operating at other times to save costs.   The resultant queues in some places even during the week were long and disorganised as others on here have commented.  It was largely a free-for-all at some lifts as we were filtered through the automated turnstiles however having reached the chair groups would then have discussions about who was going to join who as chairs headed up the mountain half empty.  I did hear some of the lift staff giving people the message to “avanti!” but often to no avail.  Despite the frustration, children apart, I didn’t see evidence of pushing and shoving within the queues as previously experienced in other parts of Europe.  Best advice is just to get on the lift with whoever is there - you might meet someone interesting!The two man chair (Colo) leading from Sauze D’Oulx to Mt Fraiteve was probably our most notable hold-up point as this was the only access when returning to Sestriere.  In stark contrast to the generally slow running lifts, such was the speed which this one whipped around to pick people up that I witnessed several women being knocked off their feet causing further delays as they were helped back up.  Across in Montgenevre the very steep and long poma alongside the black Fourneous run was an experience (apparently a 50 degree slope) which left a few of us singing an octave higher but the run itself was groomed and worth doing twice - take the 2-man Le Chalvet Superieur chair if you can!   Here it’s also worth mentioning that the slopes are divided by the road through the village and to ski continuously between them you need to stay skier’s left on the blue Pharo run to take you on a (snow-covered) bridge over the road.  The alternative, if you end up at the base of Le Chalvet cable car, is a long walk along the main road…in ski gear…in 20C if you’re unlucky to the Prarial chair!  (From personal experience I can’t recommend that).    Grooming of the pistes was generally good throughout the areas however there were sections on some of the wider runs where you could be skiing along at speed only to find that there was suddenly a ridge (running downhill) where the piste basher hadn’t evened out the joints width-wise.  The resultant drop or rise in the level of piste could catch out the unsuspecting and certainly gave me a few hairy moments as I crossed over the fault line!  I’ve never experienced this ever before, anywhere.There are some lengthy runs and whilst our break-away group spent the majority of our time on reds or blacks, others enjoyed some off-piste where available and a few of the beginners in the group took lessons based at Sestriere and seemed to progress well enough.  All in all something for all abilities.There are no separate piste maps for each area and in trying to condense the entire Via Lattea on to one side much of the detail is lost.   You may find yourself lost too.   For those of us old enough to need reading glasses it was almost a waste of time taking the map from our pockets other than to roughly guess where we’d been when we stopped for lunch.Speaking of which the mountain restaurants were generally good - but not all marked on the piste map of course!   Most memorable on this trip was Rocce Nere over at Sauze D’Doulx where we were made very welcome by the hostess, had good views and surprisingly some of us were able to have a tasty, mild chicken curry.  To finish, those who were up for it, were offered some alcoholic sugar cubes and a sherbet-burst which I managed to avoid.In Sestriere a few ventured out for the night life and had a good time however apart from a ropey singer/guitarist at the Hotel du Col and watching a couple of the Six Nations games in a pub the majority of our group spent the evenings in our hotel bar.  Apres-ski was spent mostly at Bar Sestriere where table service for a large group was good and they offered 3 beers for the price of 2 up until 7.00pm.  Pinky Bar could sometimes also accommodate large numbers and provided hot nibbles along with the drinks.   Although Sestriere isn’t an attractive town the surrounding slopes and scenery have their moments, it isn’t the most expensive place to visit and provided they don’t close the lifts there is plenty of variety to ski - I might end up there a third time!"
247,Great skiing,"I went Feb/Mar 2018 to Sauze D'oulx (Sa-oo-say D-o-ooLX) expecting not too much. What I found (although this was during the 'Beast from the East) a ski area that - yes - perhaps could have done with a bit of investment - but a ski area that was being maintained, did have a pride in itself, and was much more extensive that I'd expected. I've skied - l'Alpe d'Huez, Val d'Isere and St Anton - spend a winter in each as saisonnier/ski rep - so I expected ViaLattea to be a little wanting given some of the reviews it receives. I expected to be able to ski the ViaLattea in a day or two. Not possible. I had a half day the first day due to cloud and fog. Same on second due to cold hands. third and fourth days were full days skiing and I made it over to Sestriere during the fourth day. Fivth day I had a cold and could only ski 2 hours. Sixth day I stayed in Sauxze as I'd taken out a Snowboard. But in that time, I only skied Sauze, Sansicario and Sestriere (but not the whole resort). Did not make to either Montgenevre nor to Bardonecchia.My original plan/expectation was to ski the whole area including these. Admittedly I was hampered by cloud/fog and a cold - and even the ski map which I agree is not easy to follow. But this is a much bigger ski area that I'd expected and so I'll have to go back to complete it.All that said, the area is NOT an area for all abilities. it says there are X number of black slopes in Sestriere and X number of red runs too. In the area I covered, I can honestly say compared to my previous resorts these runs would have stuggled to be designated any more than 'blues'. Not saying you have to ski steep stuff to enjoy - but also not saying the resort should claim reds and blacks when they really are not. This was partly answered by someone on a lift - who said the resort had to have X% of red and black runs to access investment support from Italian government - so some runs were redesignated. Says it all!!But all in all -  a very enjoyable resort - much more extensive that I'd thought - will be back even though not very difficult."
248,Great Skiing,"Just returned from fantastic week in Sauze dOulx. Not a lot open, but enough to amuse for a week. Runs were nice and long and varied. Good runs through the trees. Piste conditions were surprisingly good through the week. Slopes were quiet and no lift queues. Links to other areas were partially open but, i felt, not worth the hassle. Did a day trip to Montgenevre but thought Sauze was more fun. Had great weather all week. Food and drink on the mountain is excellent and well priced. Customer service/ friendliness of staff is second to none. Lifts were okay in Sauze area. Having ski'd other areas though (Skiwelt, Austria in particular), I think the Milky Way could do with more investment in lifts, snow making and piste preparation. I think that with more snow and all areas/links open this could be fantastic ski area. All in all though a great holiday and I will return."
249,Intermediates paradise,Our favourite run was from the top of the radio tower all the way down to Sansicario - although marked 'olympic black' are a good long wide red run that takes you 3 lifts to get back to the top again!Ski pass prices are good value compared to France.
250,Great way to start the New Year,We first toyed with visiting this area in the late 90s but never made it....kids came along and plans changed...Based in Sauze we found the old part of the village very quaint and the newer part much livelier although I’m guessing had we visited 20 years ago it would’ve been rocking....Nevertheless the village is well catered for with lots of bars restaurants and hotels to choose from...The Sauze ski area however is fabulous but very dated with slow small old lifts that only work into other valleys if it’s not windy....its almost like it’s stuck in the 90s.....and reminded us of how the Sella Ronda area was in those days..... and who have incidentally invested massively and it’s paid off.....But once up and out into the vast Vialattea it’s a real mountain playground...with plenty of wide open pistes to play on....lots of restaurants and mountain refuges to wine and dine in...loved Sestriere...plenty of wide open pistes and faster lifts....We ventured as far as Montgenevre and that shows what the Italian side could be like with investment...although they could do with more mountain restaurants To say this it was all in all a fab week....loved the area and hope to return one day....It was interesting to hear some chaps on our transfer coach talking...they’d been coming to the area for a number of years and had made a decision to wait a while to return as they too felt the area is in need of an update...Visit yourself though to draw your own conclusions x
251,"Great value resort, perfect for intermediates","This is an annual ski trip and our third visit over the years to the Milky Way. It had snowed significantly since 19 December 2018, which is one of the risks you take when booking an annual ski trip back in the autumn.  When going from Sauze to Sestriere it Dabs Sicario the only route back into Sauze was down the black, which isn’t the steep, but you need to be aware if you have less able or confident skiers in your group. The wind also picked up while we were visiting Sestriere and the gondola back was closed for a while, the staff and carabineri were great in communicating with us and letting us know what was happening. We also skied in Montgenèvre which has a particularly good red that is long, wide, fast and with great views. The Milky Way provides a good variety of skiing and enables skiers of all skills and competence to have fun. Due to there being no snow fall for 3 weeks the runs were icy in places and more snow cabins higher up at Sportinia would help on the more used runs, otherwise well maintained and most lifts worked well"
252,Great Family Skiing,"This is the third time i've skied Vialettea, each time staying in Sauze D'Oulx and i'd rate my ability as an advanced intermediate. I mention my ability as it's quite important when considering your base for your holiday, you can explore the Milky way in it's entirety but during periods of inclement weather; low cloud poor visibilty or strong winds for example, many of the higher lifts are unoperational restricting your skiing experience to the base resort of your choice. You can access all of the resorts when the weather's favourable (it was for 4 of my recent 6 days) but beginners wouldn't be able to ski some of the runs that are necessary to negotiate to traverse the mountains.Of the 3 resorts i've skied within the Milky Way i'd suggest that Sestrieire is the best for a group of varied ability, with many wide blues, reds ranging from cruisey to challenging and blacks that are silly steep!Sansicario (my favourite) is best for advanced intermediates - Red 79 and the Women's 2006 Olympic run providing the bigger smiles. Sauze D'Oulx is best for all intermediates, it's my experience that beginners will struggle to be entertained and experts will fail to be excited. All of the runs are well maintained with snow cannons used for filler when there's little snow and there's lots of cleverly linked lifts although these could be considered a little slow.That said, the Ski schools at sauze are brilliant (we've tried two - special mentions to Alex and Andrea) and the Apres at sauze is the most varied and liveliest."
253,Skiing the milky way,"I've never written a poor review for a ski area before but felt I had to on this occasion . I stayed at Sauze which is a great base for a ski holiday with plenty to do in the evenings and for apres . However the mountain did not reflect the ambience of the town . I found the staff on the lifts mainly arrogant and unhelpful and the pisteards only interested in clearing the runs as quickly as possible after the lifts  closed . Nearly all the lifts shut at 16:00 which for the end of February is much too early .The lift staff are very keen on this even to the point of refusing you  access a few minutes before it closes . They can be very aggressive at times as one of our party experienced on the cabin from sestriere where she walked onto the lift at closing time oblivious to the fact that no other passengers were allowed on . Instead of explaining to her that the lift was shut the attendant stopped the lift and forced the doors open with a metal bar and threatening to call the police which left her extremely upset and frightened .  Shutting the lift system so early seems more like a money saving exercise as the finances don't seem to be there at the present time for any investment . The lift system is old and slow and the runs are narrow and do not seem to be groomed to a decent standard . The piste map is the worst I have seen anywhere it is so small that it is difficult to read and trying to figure out which runs go where , is like snakes and ladders . Piste markers are very sparse which also makes it difficult to work out which run you are on . The connection from claviers to montgenevre is the slowest I have ever experienced . The chairlift from the road up must be an original . A lot of the pistes on this side and the Sauze side were closed for no apparent reason as were some of the lifts . This could be a wonderful ski area but I have a feeling they are looking to cut costs rather than invest in the area . A great shame as people will start to go elsewhere in the end ."
254,Christmas holiday,We really enjoyed our week skiing. The weather was warm but the snow just about held up. The disappointing thing was that we felt let down when we were skiing back from France. After a long day skiing We had skied the last lift (button) which takes you back to the black runs to Sauze and then without any warning they closed the lifts ! We were stranded without any communication on how to get back. The only information we got was from a friendly tourist.We had to ski back to sansicario and somehow get a taxi that was non existent. It was our hotel owner who saved us.Poor customer service to say the least.
255,Sestriere based visit to Milky Way ski area,"I had a wonderful time - went with a group of friends who were mainly keen skiers and stayed in fairly basic accommodation. I would recommend getting a deal with a tour operator as they will organise lots of the details like hire, accommodation and lift passes. Went to a really nice ski school in Sportinia (a short lift ride from Sauze d'Oulx) for three days having skied for about a week previously and that gave me the confidence to explore the whole Vialattea region with my friends. Two of our party were new to skiing and I have to say that their needs were not particularly well catered for (not many beginner runs and several quite steep) and in Sauze there was not much other than skiing to do. I'd therefore recommend it to intermediate skiers especially on a budget, or if you've got a mixed ability party, maybe try a resort like Sestriere or Montgenevre which have better beginner courses nearby and arrange some trips to other attractions like the city of Turin (which has some fascinating museums) or the fort of Augustus."
256,great area,"the area is very large and spread out. The issue , for me , is that the lift system seems a bit old and needs updating. The links to the far end from sauze take a long time to get to and requires waiting for lifts. Which is a shame as the area is good for many levels of skiers and boarders."
257,nice tree-lined runs,"We had 10 days based in Sauze d'Oulx, and pretty much covered the whole of the Milky Way area. The only criticism of the area is the route back into Sauze when you go to places like Sestriere or Montgenevre. You have a couple of black runs which get really difficult in the afternoons, or a very tricky narrow blue țraverse. And the only way out is a two-seat chair. Investment in a gondola would make life easier for the less-accomplished skiers.We took the tour of Via Lattea marked on the map, and completed it comfortably enough in the day. It included some of the best runs in the area, none of which were particularly difficult (except that descent from Fraiteve). Highlights for us were the runs through the forest in the middle of the mountain. Always in good condition and always fun, with opportunities to dip into the trees. We're not that confident off-piste, but plenty of people were having a great time in there. Signposting could be better, restaurants are excellent."
258,Great Stuff,"I stayed in Sauze d’Oulx over Christmas 2012. It was my second visit and my first for 12 years. On both occasions I have stayed outside the town so can’t really comment on the famously rowdy nightlife, other than to say that the bars I did visit seemed very reasonably priced for après ski bars. Particularly when compared to their neighbours over the French or Swiss borders.More importantly; the skiing. Via Lattea is renowned as being a great place for intermediates and I can see why. There are a huge number of red runs from top to bottom that offer picturesque ways down the mountain without offering anything too challenging. Beginners in Sauze d’Oulx must ascend a chairlift in order to access the nursery slopes, which at least gives them a taste of being up in the mountains, but also means that they must return to the village the same way (the run down has some tricky sections, but most beginners should be able to get down after a week’s tuition).More advanced skiers need to grab their kicks where they can. Most of the ‘black runs’ in the resort would be better described as ‘dark red’, as under normal conditions few offer any great challenge. The runs accessible by chairlift 12 and draglift 30 are probably the most enjoyable. There are a couple of short steep runs over in Sestriere, accessible by draglifts (when the lifts are running, which they won’t be if it’s too windy, too cold, too misty or they can find any other excuse to turn them off), but Via Lattea seems to harbour no ambitions to be seen as an ‘extreme resort’ in the way that Chamonix, Verbier and St Anton are. This was evident when I asked a (Inghams) rep whether it was possible to hire an off-piste guide in the town. He didn’t think that it was. That said, it was possible to find some interesting off-piste. The area under the upper Clotes chairlift is good fun in fresh powder, and there was a well skied section under one of the lifts in Sestriere (22 I think) that had turned into quite good moguls. There are also some short options from the top of the lift that goes from Sportinia that bring you out on one of the main red runs. The size of Via Lattea (400 km of piste) is impressive but misleading. The individual areas are not particularly well connected, and I have never managed to ski to Montgenevre (if you wish to you are best advised to take the 45 minute bus trip). Getting from Sauze to Sestriere is relatively straight forward, but it is advisable to ski to the Gondala mid station as if you ski down as far as you can then you will face a hike across town to get to a lift (such inefficiency would not be tolerated in Austria!). The trip to Claviere is more of a pain. To get there you must descend in a gondola, and to get back you either have to take two chairs down or one chair and ski the most boring, flattest, most tedious path imaginable for what seems like forever. Hence if you stay in Sauze you will mainly ski Sauze. And you will have Sauze skied in a couple of days.I would go back to Via Lattea (although I would probably stay in Sestriere). It offers excellent value for money (usually I take a packed lunch when I’m skiing, but here the mountain restaurants were so reasonable that I didn’t bother), great hospitality and stunning scenery. It will never be one of those ‘must ski’ resorts, but it is charming and friendly, and is only an hour from Turin which has to be a major advantage over Livigno (just as good value but three and a half hours from an airport). If you are an intermediate skier, maybe on your third, fourth or fifth week skiing, or you are more experienced but don’t constantly crave that adrenalin rush, then I can think of nowhere better for you."
259,Best skiing resort in Italy,"The Milky Way has has substantial investment over the last few years. The lift system is still not state of the art, but it does work well and is efficient. A great variety of skiing to suit all,is available with range of linked resorts available to offer good variety"
260,Attractive skiing area,"I liked how kind and helpful the staff were, and I liked the bar area and the dining room. The food was brilliant and I really liked the tea and amazing little cakes after ski-ing. The ski locker room and boot room were fine. There was very little that I didn't like, although I would have preferred it if all the bedrooms and bathrooms had been larger."
