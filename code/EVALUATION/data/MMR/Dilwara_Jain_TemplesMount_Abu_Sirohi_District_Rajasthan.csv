125,Antiques,"While the temples are a place of religious importance and have an important place for the Jain sect, they are also a testimony of how rich the art and architecture of ancient India was.

164,Superb Marble Work,"Dilwara temples are definitively a Marvel. The temples are neat and clean. The carvings are beautiful and very evidently a result of long and skillful effort. Some knowledge of Jain scriptures and mythology will help in understanding the carvings. Otherwise also one can enjoy the art and marvel at the skill and patience required to create such sculptures. Personally I feel that they are superior to Taj Mahal but are less well known because they have not been promoted in a similar manner. Probably that actually works in favour of the temples. Photography, revealing attire, leather articles (except belt and wallet) and footwear(obviously) are prohibited inside the temple complex. Basic amenities are very basic indeed."

258,Must Visit,"I had heard a lot about these temples before, but never even in dreams I thought they would leave such a longlasting memory on my heart and mind.  I imagined them to be like other beautiful temples, but all these thoughts shattered after entering in the temple premises.  Theâ€¦"
259,Nice Experience,The carvings in marble are really exquisite and make you proud of the glorious culture that India has. I would definitely recommend that you take a guide along (provided by the temple authorities) as they tell you things which make you appreciate the beauty of the temples even more by putting a new perspective on some of the things. It is a little disappointing that cameras and mobile phones are not allowed and also you cannot sit in the temples. But a must visit if you are visiting Mount Abu.

261,Good temple lot of carvings,"We went here first time as part of the tour group. Got 90 minutes to go around with guides explaining the various temples.  It wasnâ€™t enough though, so we went there again next day and spent a few hours cherishing the craftmanship.   This is a must visit place if you are in Abu. "

264,The best and finest creatures of art engraved on stones,Such a marvellous work of passion and art... no words are enough to describe how beautiful the temples are.

268,Symphony in stone,"Enshrining the divinities of Jainism, this temple is nothing less than one of the finest architectural marvels of Indian workmanship. The simple outer facade of the temple belies the intricate marble carvings inside the temples, not to mention the magnificent statue made of Panchadhatu weighing north of 4 tons. The grandeur of this temple complex and spiritual ambience makes Dilwara Temples truly one of the must visit places at Mount Abu."

277,First even religious locatoon that doesnt chrge entry fee,"The Five Marvels Of Dilwara TemplesThe opulent Dilwara Temple consists of five temples built over the centuries. They are-1. Vimal Vasahi Temple- Dedicated to Lord Adinath, the first Jain Tirthankar Lord, Vimal Vasahi Temple is the most famous and oldest amongst all the temples. It was built by Vimal Shah, the Solanki Maharaja of Gujarat in 1021. It has richly carved ceilings, roofs, doors and mandaps. The immaculate patterns of petals, flowers, lotuses, murals and scenes from mythology are simply awe-inspiring. Erected in an open courtyard, the temple is surrounded by a corridor which has smaller idols of the Tirthankaras. Gudh Mandap is the main hall, where the idol of Lord Adinath resides. It is believed that 1,500 masons and 1,200 labourers took 14 years to build the temple and it costs Rs 185.3 million.2. Luna Vasahi Temple- Built in 1230, Luna Vasahi Temple is dedicated to Lord Neminath, the 22nd Jain Tirthankara Lord. The second prominent temple, it was built in 1230 by two Porwad brothers namely Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of Virdhaval, in the memory of their brother Luna. The Rang Mandap is the central hall which has 72 figures of Tirthankaras in a circular band and 360 figures of Jain monks. It also has a Hathishala which houses 10 marble elephants and a giant black stone pillar called Kirthi Stambh. A Navchowki has nine delicately designed ceilings.3. Pittalhar Temple- The third temple was built by Bhima Seth and is dedicated to Lord Rishabdeo, the first Jain Tirthankara Lord. A huge statue of Lord Adinath made of five metals and brass is installed in the temple. This temple also has Garbhagraha, Gudh Mandap and a Navchowki.4. Parshwanatha Temple- A three-storeyed building and the tallest of all the temples, it was built by Mandlik as a dedication to Lord Parshavanath, the 23rd Jain Tirthankar Lord in 1459. The temple has four main halls, and the walls have remarkable carvings on grey sandstone.5. Mahavir Swami Temple- Dedicated to Lord Mahavir, the 24th Jain Tirthankara Lord, this temple is comparatively smaller but, it will fascinate you equally.
