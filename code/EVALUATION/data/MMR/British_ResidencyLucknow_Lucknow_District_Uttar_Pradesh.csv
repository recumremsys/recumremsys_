0,A most for historians,"Lucknow is a gem for history enthusiasts.  The town holds a very special place in the rise and eventual fall of British rule.  It is the scene of the 1857 mutiny where about 3000 people took refuge in the Residency.  The battle and siege continued for about 5 months and only about 1000 marched out at the time of surrender.The British Residency is a must see and a guide is a must to get the most from this incredible site.  The grounds inside the gated walls are immense and the buildings grand and infrastructure advanced.  The ruins still depict the great halls, living quarters, administration blocks and other buildings.  Some of the walls are riddled with holes from cannon shot and others bear the scars of fire damage.  The battles must have been ferocious but, prior to the siege, it was a grand existence and not difficult to see why the Europeans enjoyed their time and were reluctant to return home.Do visit the museum which has a scale model of the site and some historic exhibits.  Unfortunately it was partly closed on the day we visited.  It was a little sad to see this once great structure in this ruined state but it is not difficult to imagine how severe the fighting must have been.  This a must see historic site."
1,A piece of history,"This place tells you the history of Lucknow especially in the last 150 years. The  British Residency has within its walls, the graves of British soldiers who died in the Revolt of 1857. The people of Lucknow tell intriguing stories of the ruins. The British Residency of Lucknow serves as a government office. The Residency also has a museum that is well-maintained by the authorities. You’ll also find the tombs Sadat Ali Khan, who was the first Nawab of Awadh, Kaisarbagh Palace and an observatory built for Colonel Wilcox, who was a British astronomer.This place is spread across many acres. Be prepared to walk."
2,Lucknow as of now,"Steeped in the history of the 1857 uprising, this place is like a time capsule. The entire area is beautifully restored and maintained really well. Its a must visit"
3,A ruined Historical Building,It is a legacy of the times gone by and what Lucknow was prior to Independence. A must see for a tourist.British Residency is a must for those who want to know about First armed freedom movement of India in 1857. This place was used by Britishers to post their armed forces. Now most of the building are ruined and open places are covers with garden grass. Its history itself.symbol of resistance against oppression and struggle for freedom from British tyranny. Must visit if in Lucknow.
4,British Residency,"It is a legacy of the times gone by and what Lucknow was prior to Independence. A must see for a tourist. Don't be surprised if you catch a few ""love birds"" but that won't take away the magnificence of the place. Believed to be haunted. Not seen a ghost personally."
5,Well Maintained Ruinous State,The tales of 1857 revolve in Lucknow around this place  and it surprisingly is well kept in ruinous state still .It is a large place and requires walking  and one must have atleast two hours to see the place .
6,British Residency,The residency is a unique historical asset for Lucknow. The buildings that have remained are poignant reminders of the war during the British times that also led to the mutiny. Cannonball markers and shots clearly visible in the buildings. The museum well worth visiting. We felt that1) site was not well maintained while gardens seem good2) curation of the artifacts is done poorly3) lighting in the interior buildings is very poor so is access 4) can be made in a more powerful experience if the government took care.
7,Shadow of the atrocities of the colonial Era ,The place is really interesting to visit in lucknow.. British Residency- having its presence in the history books.. best place to history lovers...
8,Visit of Residency,"A story of 1857 revolt by our own freedom fighters, a must see place to understand the history of Lucknow during British regime. See the museum and go around to see the  architecture of building made by ""lakhori"" bricks, graveyards of the British who were killed during the coup. Best to read about British Residency before visiting there, and if possible get a Guide ,who will explain you in detail.Keep some time to see it."
9,Loved the history of the place,This place holds a significance in the Indian freedom struggle. This was the place where the Indian won their first battle and gheroed the British high officials. The light and sound show that takes place almost every evening is a must watch. It gives a detailed information. Very beautifully maintained. Must go.
10,Worth a visit ,"The Residency is an interesting part of Lucknow history with beautiful fusion of Nawabi and Colonial architecture. Residency is often overlooked by tourist, and usually most tour guides don't include it in their tour, but is definitely worth a visit.  The reason I have not rated it very high is due to the cleanliness and poor maintenance of this beautiful part of Lucknow."
11,Good place,The ruins of the residency are well worth seeing to see the difference in lifestyle of the British rulers to the average citizen.  It is in stark contrast to the average person who lives here.  The site is being upgraded but is wonderful shape.  All of the writings are in both English and Hindi.  You can take the place in on your own pace in a few hours.
12,Old decaying building,A must visit place for the history lovers. It’s a witness of the atrocities done by the British colonisers during The Revolt of 1857.
13,Where every brick tells a story,The ruins of the Residency remind us of the great uprising of 1857 in Lucknow. They are preserved in the same condition in which they came under central protection in the year 1920. It all began in 1774 AD when Nawab Shuja-ud-daulah first agreed on the proposal of keeping a British resident stationed in Awadh.
14,Worth visiting ,"Culture & history always speaks, you can feel it by visiting The British Residency in Lucknow.It has mostly the ruins of the great Indian Rebellion of 1857.It is a very unique photogenic heritage place.It has been declared a protected monument by The Archaeological Survey of India.It is very nice to see buildings without roof because they ruined during 1857."
15,good,"Perfect for both history buffs and general tourists, this vast remnant of the British Residency in Lucknow is definitely worth visiting, provided the weather doesn't get in the way.Lots of ruins of buildings to explore, plus the museum depicting scenes from the British Raj"
16,Cool!,"you can relive the past when Indians fought their first freedom struggle. Besides this, the residency wall has the mark of bullets at several paces, a lush green cover in the huge area and tranquil silence welcomes and envelops you."
17,Good place ,By the side of history Residency has a great significance.One would love roaming and seeing the remnants of the area where british officials once lived.The attraction is great.The only thing annoying is either lovers scratch their names or indulge in showing their love openly.The latter is a bit disgusting one must stop it.Otherwise it is a great attraction.
18,SITE OF FIRST FREEDOM STRUGGLE,"A witness of 1857 revolt, standing tall amidst city of Lucknow, is a historic monument where one can find traces of the  great war of Indian Independence. The building is in demolition phase still seeks attention of many history lover, but British Residency in the phase of renovation is a good place to know your past. Great building, gardens and there is a graveyard, exemplifying the fight put forwarded by the British soldiers. My reason for visit residency is somewhat different I love to watch the architect, beauty and excellence of construction from bygone days. While exploring and roaming around the building do not forget to visit museum well preserved by the authorities. When you are roaming inside the Residency you will found that this places has everything like Church, Graveyard, post office, jail and even school, but all are on the verge of devastating. Hope authority will take care of other buildings inside the British residency. Overall it s great escape from the city and traffic in mere 5 INR as an entry fee."
19,History preserved,"Despite the brutal legacy of the Mutiny (or The First War of Indian Independence), the people of Lucknow have respectfully maintained the old British residency, still marked with cannon and bullet holes. It's a quiet green space today. There's a small graveyard, the ruins of the garrison church, and a modest museum that includes a diorama of the cantonment circa 1857. It helps to come with some prior knowledge of the history of that struggle or with a guide because there aren't too many information points."
20,History teaches,The remains of the British residency have been preserved very well. The place is symbolic of the first war of independence in 1857 and some of the stories there relive the event. The small museum to is worth the visit  I feel one should allocate atleast around 1 hour at a non sunny time.
21,Residency still carrying wounds,Its an old heritage which still has marks of the war of 1857 also known as the first war of Indian Independence. A must visit is someone is coming to Lucknow.
22,Historical visit,Must see this when in Lucknow. The place is beautifully maintained and is a treat for history lovers.
23,Must see for historians,Scene of some of the most intense fighting during the First War of Independence / Indian Mutiny The Residency offers an oasis of peace in which to reflect on the wrongs inflicted during Britain's early acquisitive capitalist stage and the roots of colonialism.
24,Amazing ,This large complex of buildings now mostly stark ruins bears eloquent witness to the Indian Uprising of 1857 when the area was under prolonged siege and bombardment. The buildings are surrounded by well-maintained gardens.
25,Ghost town full of Romantic couples,This piece of history need few guides which are not there.it's a very important part of indian history but other than maintainace and cleaning no such good initiative has been taken by state govt.onle some destroyed building and few descriptive boards.before you go just Google the history of that place...it will create interest..
26,Good for history buffs,"The Residency was my number 1 reason for visiting Lucknow. This particular period of history has long interested me so I was very pleased to arrive at the gates on a sparkling, sunny, warm morning.   I was quite surprised to note the size of the site but thrilled to see how well it is all kept & despite the death & destruction that took place there, how peaceful & beautiful it is now with massive trees & flowering shrubs studding the lawns & towering over the ruins.   The British had been allowed a residency here in the Kingdom of Oudh but when they finally annexed Oudh on the pretext of maladministration it became one of the factors that provoked the mutiny/ uprising of 1857.   The Residency became a sanctuary for the British as Mutineers overran the city & they held out ( with large losses on either side ) for 5 months. The Banquetting Hall  became a hospital. Sir Henry Lawrence was in charge of the British Garrison but was fatally wounded early on. After 3 months re inforcements arrived, led by General Havelock, easing conditions but it was a couple of months later that Sir Colin Campbell with his Sikh's & Highlander's broke the siege.  You can still see the bullet & cannon shot damage to the walls. A small museum houses a model of The Residency site & some lithographs."
27,Best in the city..,This place is must visit especially if you have young children studying history. It was the hotbed of Sepoy Mutiny and Indian soldiers had laid a siege of Residency for over two months. The only problem is that there are no guides available to explain the finer details of each structure. Each of the structures has some details written in front but you still clamour for more. Details are also available in Braille. One must reserve at least 3-4 hours for the tour. This place also provides excellent photo-op locations. There’s a small museum in the Annexe building of Residency which provides some insight into the history.
28,Historical significance,Parked in the middle of Lucknow city and is the preserved ruins of the first war of independence. The area still has the building which were destroyed in 1857 along with some massive cannons. One should note that the museum is closed on Friday
29,Lots of important Anglo Indian history ,The British Residency is a fantastic historical site best visited with a local guide who can explain the intetesting history of this place..recommended
30,Residency: glimpse to British living in mid-1880s,its quite a huge place and one can see and admire the beauty of this place and the life of the nawabs and later the Englishmen who stayed there and the Indian soldiers who captured it later. The place is beautiful but quite haunting
31,GOOD PLACE,"Only a few locations in India bear histories of both Mughal Era and British India. The Residency is one of them. The Sepoy Mutiny in 1857 among Indian soldiers here, was one of the earliest freedom movement."
32,Good place for history student ,This old monument showcases the lovely brick architecture of oudh and also brings forth the tragedy of the siege of oudh and residency by rebel troops around the era of the mutiny. Good time to visit is early morning ..
33,Ghosts of nawabs and mutiny,Created by the British to safe guard its people the place still bears testimony to the British Raj in India.
34,Amazing Historical Building,"Located about 6 km from Lucknow's Charbag railway station lies an area seeped in past history, called Residency. A large british garrision which became famous in 1857 as it served as a refuge for over 2000 british soldiers during the mutiny during the four & half month seige. Today past ruins n many graves remain and the place has been given a heritage status. Well maintained with lovely lawns. Worth a visit."
35,A great monument,"The British Residency has an aura of its own. Open from Sunrise to sunset, this place offers a good walk amongst the monuments. You need a vivid imagination to recreate the seize laid down by Indian soldiers who held British as hostage for quite many daysA small museum with portraits of Nawabs and British residents, is closed on Mondays. Ideal time to visit is early mornings or evenings in summers and during afternoons in winters. Tickets are priced at Rs. 15/- per head. If you are a foreigner, you have to pay Rs. 200/-"
36,Eloquent evidence of a troubled time,This is a stunning set of buildings telling vivid story of the 1857 uprising.The place is very well kept and has a nice museum too. Must visit. Keep aside at least 90-120 minutes for this.
37,Seeped in History,A wonderful collection of monuments from British legacy ...Has a fascinating history .A must on the list of visitors to Lucknow. Needs two hours to see properly with the museum itself needing half an hour ....A delight for photo enthusiasts
38,Nice colonial era architecture,British Raj Memories as well as the Mughal to British transition memorabilia is extensive here with many ruins and vast area of park well maintained for the sake of History lovers. It is a Heritage site and a visit to this place is worth its time. May be not so exciting a visit for the youngsters.
39,Fantastic,This monument to the people who fought and died here is remarkable.  It is like actually being involved in the siege.  The grounds and what remains of the buildings are beautifully maintained and the small museum is very interesting.
40,A Palatial Beauty,A beautiful place for monument lovers amidst the hustle and bustle of city life of Lucknow. You can find a good dose for your eyes as well as for camera. Try it on week days when number of visiters are less. You can communacte with the walls of British era. The museum inside The Residency narrates the entire story of 1857.
41,A peaceful place ... today,"The visit in the residency gives an outline of the British rule and the efforts of Indians for freedom. It is however not as any other such sight I have ever been into as it mirrors a very different conception, with signs of sorrow for the lost British people residing there..which was pretty weird for an independence monument. Also very attractive sight to walk around!"
42,In ruins but recommended,This building is a witness of freedom fighting in India.A good option to spend time.Many burnt buildings are inside its premises.There is a small museum here.Entry ticket is 20 Rs.
43,Must Visit Monument,"This is the place where the mutiny of 1857 started. The tell tale signs are visible all over the ancient buildings. Built from 1775 to 1800 to accommodate the British resident, the structures are opulent and suggestive of the lavish lifestyle of its occupants.The museum on campus shows some nice pictures."
44,Wow history lesson!,Another historical building in Lucknow that one should see while visiting Lucknow.Though now in ruins but once it was the official residence of British Governor General. The historical 1987 Freedom Strugle also started from here.
45,Black History Reminder,"Amazing place. Full of colonial history and the ruins of the famous siege of 1857. Surrounded by lovely lawns, has a fairly good museum too. A must-visit for history buffs. Visit in winters or at least, in pleasant weather months to be able to explore the ruins and hear the tales in comfort."
46,Great Place,Gives a peek into the Britishers way of living of 18th and 19th century Lucknow. Very well maintained  neat and well marked. Ruins throw a lot about times. Some are eerie...must visit.
47,History,"We all know of India's First War of Independence, but a visit to this place makes one more aware of the fierce, difficult battle and resistance against the British that was out up by Awadh.The museum could be better, but still quite informative.Keep some time for this attraction."
48,Good place,Residency is historic and landmark ancient place of India's freedom struggle and Awadh empire revolution against English. This place id upkeep as heritage place and open for visitors with a nominal ticket price. People can visit this place to get the experience of revolt and freedom struggle for India's Independence.
49,The british residency,"Has an aura typical of the british raj, connected to the first uprising of 1857 Mutiny as we had read in our history books.I am unsure whether they still continue to stage the sound & light show depicting the Mutiny of 1857. This used be an attraction some time ago.There also exists a 'Martiniere Post', were one Teacher and 52 students of The La Martiniere Boys' Lucknow held and fought for the Residency, this happened to be the forward most post which was attached the first.For the bravery shown by the Boys' the School was awarded with a Battle Honour, the only School in the world to have been awarded such a military distinction.This School too is a place worth visiting in Lucknow."
50,Definitely worth a visit when in Lucknow,British Residency is a old historical and peaceful place of lucknow. This place is quite attractive. Must visit place.
51,Historical place.,This is the one place to visit in lucknow most buildings are in ruins but you can still see canon ball holes and bullet holes on the walls . The museum is very interesting showing old photographs but the real gem of this site is the cemetery listing all of the fallen soldiers of the 1857 mutiny.
52,Excellent.   Unmissable. Number 1 on a list of sights to visit in Lucknow.,"If you want to understand the period around the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, this is a must see.Beautiful maintained by the government and a wonderful museum inside. Life under the East India Company and the British rule and how a handful of soldiers created a Mutiny is a must see."
53,How did this defend the Residency for so long,The ruins are sad and magnificent and reeks of an era of violence and colonial rule. Well preserved and maintained and very very interesting. The musuem on site also has a few nuggets of interest
54,Evocative Ruins Surrounded by Extensive Lawns & Shaded by Massive Old Trees.,British residency would give you a glimpse of British raj over India in early 20th century. Quite a historical place.
55,History Unfolds!,It is good place to take children there and tell them about our history. Specially last period of Oudh nawabs.
56,a walk into History,This was where the seige of Lucknow took place and there are some interesting buildings and a nice park to walk round.
57,Brutish residency,Remnants of a fierce battle with the British during the First Battle of Independence in India. The place is ruins but does make you feel nostalgic. There is a small museum as well. Will be appreciated by those with a historical bent of mind
58,An absolute must when visiting Lucknow,This place has lot of history inside it.Britishers used to live here before independence...But the fight for freedom started here...1857...The rebels(krantikari) attacked and killed all the britishers here...You can still see the evidence here....The marks of bullet guves goosebumps
59,Moving monument of a bygone time. ,British Residency is a good place to watch. One must visit this place to get a glimpse of this wonderful architecture.
60,Time Warp- Photographer's delight,A visit to this site will provoke a feeling of Patriotism. First Freedom Fight commenced from here in 1857.Hats off to the Freedom Fighters and martyrs for our Independence.
61,Interesting historical site ,A fabulous piece of history which is being preserved half heartedly.  J Fayrer's bungalow ruins transport you back to the days of1857. The museum has some wonderful sketches of Lucknow of the 19 th century.However the most disgusting thing is to find signs of vandalism on the walls . You will find many cheap romeos with their equally cheap dates sheltering in the corners and engaged in titillation
62,Nice place to hamg out,Well maintained by ASI. A must visit place in Lucknow. One can spend almost the whole day here. The walls still bears the bullet marks. Innumerable benches to take rest after walking for long. Don't miss it!
63,Mutiny Monument,"Visiting this place is entering in the past. Our freedom fighters of 1857 eliminated the foriegn rule and ruined the british authourity success fully. The hindu and the muslims fought together and won. A must visit place, very well curated ."
64,Trip down the memory lane,"One of the Historic place in Lucknow. Nicely maintained. One must also visit, 1857 Memorial Museum within the premises."
65,A slice of history,A must for any visiting Brit Very emotive and historic place where more VC medals were awarded than anywhere else in the world Well kept and great staff
66,Good place,British Residency is a beautiful and a worth visiting place in the city. It has a very old buildings which one can see during their visit. A good location for photographers.
67,touch of the raj and clean,There is no such interaction in this place but once it can be visited. British Residency reminds me of history. Its nice place.
68,Beautifully maintained,"History buffs , who would love to know more about the Lucknow siege that took place during the first war of Indian independence, this is the right place to start from . The monuments are well maintained. It is advised to know the history beforehand since there are not many guides available to explain the same . This is a must visit place in Lucknow."
69,Best historic place,"Lucknow appeared not to attract as many tourists and many other places in India although it is the capital and largest city of the state of Uttar Pradesh being an important administrative centre.  It is a major Islamic area but was once once a major headquarters for the British, hence this large British Residency complex, some of which is in ruins following the 1857 Siege of Lucknow. A church has completely gone. The gardens and lawns are well maintained and there is a small museum within the grounds plus a cemetery.."
70,Most under-rated,Historical place in Lucknow Evidence of 1857 revolt Lucknow.1857 revol.the British Residency is among the most famous landmarks in Lucknow. Though the building is now in ruins yet its charm cannot be overlooked. Archaeological Survey of India has declared it a protected monument. The British Residency used to serve as a refuge for as many as 3000 British inhabitants in 1857 during the time of the uprising
71,History written on the bricks of each building,"Our guide imparted a wealth of information in relation to the siege of Lucknow.  You can still see many bullet holes embedded in the walls.  Restoration appears to be progressing, wander around the buildings and just imagine what it must have been like in the days of British Rule.  The central building with photographs and maps of how it once was is well worth the visit."
72,Experience History !!!,One tends to go back in time when one visits this place. The ruins tell a story of a glorious past that was loved here by Britishers.
73,Important historically,Its history itself.symbol of resistance against oppression and struggle for freedom from British tyranny. Must visit if in lucknow. Witness of never seen before valour of tahjeebi lucknow which forced union jack to unfurl 24 hrs a day which never ever happened before.every brick has its own story.To enjoy it fully one should read 1857 1st war of independence.
74,Nice!,A must see historical site when visiting Lucknow. In the Indian Mutiny of 1857 this British Residency was besieged. You can see the buildings with cannon and bullet holes. There is a museum in the grounds that tells you about what happened in the siege. It is now quite a peaceful place unlike all those years ago when the residency was besieged.
75,Awesome,"Indian national history marks the siege at this location as an important battle in the First War for Independence, 1857-8. The ""attraction"" is more park than monument; its (now) peaceful grounds a quiet refuge, with the site preserved in its post-siege state; structures breached, many in ruins. The Residency's former administration building serves as an exhibition hall, a small one at that. A hole in the south wall remains from a cannon ball that killed one Ms. Hutchinson, inside during the siege. The exhibit also includes portraits of local figures, a scale mode of the site, various period photographs, and a short film are on display. Adjacent to the lawn for the administration building is a shrine, where, on the afternoon of our visit, a young woman had was seated on the bare ground, contorting herself as an elderly woman watched over her. Our guide said that the woman was engaged in expunging evil spirits and to not walk too closely."
76,"Must visit place in Lucknow, British Redidency",This place is a must for those who want to know about First armed freedom movement of India in 1857. This place was used by Britishers to post their armed forces.
77,A must do,"Fairly well maintained. Beautiful site worth a visit any day. To do justice to Lucknow visit, it will need 6 days at least."
78,A good green walk,This is a very very famous location from Lucknow and a very special building which contributed in the freedom of India. You can see that time marks of Canon and Bullets.
79,History experience,Good architecture and structure to see. Historic place since long. Symbol of british occupation in India. It’s must see for anyone visiting Lucknow. It’s part of heritage & culture of Lucknow too.
80,Brilliant historical site,"The place which must have been vibrant during its day, is in ruins after the rebellion. Good place to visit to understand the history."
81,Well worth the visit,The residency is well maintained within beautiful grounds it must have been quite something in its heyday. The mutiny or first war of independence is a sad reminder of different times.Well worth a visit and the little museum and cemetery are not to be missed.
82,Brilliant,"Very interesting site. A real pieace of history. An oasis in the middle of the city, clean and well kept."
83,Haunting,One of the best place to visit in Lucknow. The residence was the cantonment of the British which was destroyed by the Indian soldiers during the Sipahi Virodh in 1857. The residence is still bearing the wounds of the shells and bullets till date. Its an ASI monument. Ticket price is Rs 25
84,A Historical monument,excellent place to visit. has a museum also. Gives a feel of what happened in 1857. provide knowledge of historical characters
85,A not to be missed monument,"The British Residency is a very interesting place to visit in Lucknow. Having a guide is well worth it, to hear the history and find out the details of the place."
86,Memory of 1857 revolt,"A very nice place to stroll around and look at the ruines of buildings from the Raj-era (although entry is expensive for foreigners). If you're there, take a book with you and enjoy the gardens (where you can relax and have some ""silence"")"
87,Poorly maintained,Definitely worth visiting.  Especially when the weather is cooler.  Very interesting history from the Revolt of 1857 where the Indians laid siege to this place.  Beautifully manicured lawns and nice to walk around. Quite peaceful.
88,Having good loactions,British residency a very less known historic monument of great relevance is literally in hiding due to lack of awareness or may be promotion.this monumet in lucknow is  in the heart of the city a few km from hazratganj. can be easily located. it has  a minimal entry ticket and adequate parking .at least i could find one. .british residency is nothing but the ruins of the residency that endured the great sepoy mutiny of 1857 and ruins tell us a lot of the engineering and architecture and the elaborate layout.tips: no guides available. allow 2-3 hours time to enjoy the trip. carry water .and preserve the entry ticket.no more history since it is all available on google. info- the first song of a recent hindi movie  RAID has been shot at this place. enjoy the photos.don't miss visiting the place if one is in lucknow.
89,1857 revolt - Lucknow,"This residency is a fine example of British leadership, splendor and exploitative culture. Also, it depicts the excellence of architectural, engineering and construction skills of the Nawabs."
90,Glimpses of 1857 revolts.,"Must visit if you are in Lucknow. It's a tryst with history. While ASI has done a reasonably good job bit still many areas of the residency need improvement. Also the ticket prices need to be increased from Rs 15 as else it is like a ""Piya Milan"" area."
91,Heritage which reminds us of first war of Independence,"Lucknow is known more as the erstwhile capital of the Awadhi Nawabs and for its Nawabi cuisine. In our popular narratives on Indian colonial history, I don't think this city occupies a prominent place. It therefore came as an interesting surprise to me to find that there is a complex called The Residency in Lucknow. And a visit to this complex proved to be eye-opening, re-fuelling my interest in the First War of Indian Independence, as the Sepoy Mutiny is also known as. The Residency is actually a mansion built towards the end of the 18th century by the Nawab for the Resident appointed by the British East India Company to oversee affairs in this province. After the mansion was completed, other buildings were added in the complex continually until the mid-nineteenth century. And owing to the British nature of its occupants, this complex took some really heavy shelling during the Sepoy Mutiny. The shelling blew away walls, ceilings and windows, leaving behind the scarred buildings that you see today. As you venture into the ruins of each building, a sense of atmosphere grips you. From the broken walls and windows, you try to imagine how this building would have been a banquet hall or another, the Resident's daily abode.   If you are interested in history and culture, you should spend a few hours at The Residency. The museum inside the complex is a nice addition: it rounds up the action from Colonial times for you in pictures."
92,Historical site,THE BRITISH RESIDENCY of Lucknow is a famous  architect related to indian freedom struggle.It associate with 1857 revolt.Many signs of bullets are still there.The building is in ruin condition.
93,Historical,Best attraction in Lucknow but that’s no huge compliment. If you like war or history then it is very interesting and tells a great story. Could be better maintained.
94,Nice History,"This was Residency for British representative in the court of Nawab. The place is very nicely maintained. It appears as if you have gone back in time. Most of it is in ruins but you can feel the past in the walls of various buildings. Bullet marks and descriptions written, give the real feel of the 1857 mutiny. Must visit place if you want to peep into history and one of the best tourist spots in the city of Lucknow. Entry fee is nominal."
95,Historical Place,Spoilt by the weather. But it is a must visit place so much history really enjoyed walking around the ruins. Museum is a disappointment.
96,Very Interesting historical monument,"The size of the complex is tremendous. Full of historical significance. Small museum is worthy of a visit. Peaceful and full of nature. Not much left of the Residency, but good indication of the war that took place there."
97,Good place to visit!!,Very well maintained place by ASI. Must see for all people interested in knowing history of British era.
98,A photographer's paradise - takes you to the old age,It is spread over a big area. 1857 Memorial museum is also in British residency. A lot of history is associated with this place but I didn't find any guide here.
99,A Historical molument in the heart of Lucknow,"This is probably the only sign of our Victory during the War of Independence in 1857. I am sure it must have a beautiful place when the Resident Governor of Lucknow was occupying this place along with his entire team of Office Staff, Army, Families. Its a mini city by itself which was well fortified before the war of Independence. Now what you see are the ruins of various buildings like the Governor's Residence, Armory, treasury, Club House, Stables, Church, Mosque etc. Only intact building is the Museum inside the complex - though a small museum but worth spending 15-20 minutes there. One can spent hours and hours here imagining as to how this complex would have looked in the early 19th century. We were happy to find clean wash rooms and Drinking water in this complex."
100,closed,A large estate that once belonged to the British resident in Lucknow. Most of the buildings are in ruins but the museum is worth visiting.
101,Lost in Lucknow,It was great visiting the Residency. If you are interested in history of India's independence you must visit.
102,Time has stopped here,One can go here and see the history of old India. Not much to see here but whatever is there is mesmorizing
103,Well maintained and Historical Ruins,It is a historical place and it is neat and clean. But it lacked a guide and without whom the truth about the ruins could not be understood.
104,For history lovers,"If you are in Lucknow, please don't miss this place. This place was built by Britishers. Very beautiful and mind-blowing structure."
105,Very educative,"I walked in with great enthusiasm to see the instance of 1857 revolution and resedential place of british officers built by nawabs. There is a museum inside which must be seen, residence of bristish officers and varios makbara , mosque and imambara.. But when i walk inside there were couples all around with all ages and permutation combination. It was all very disappointing."
106,Reatored site evoking memories of the 1857 Mutiny,sign of our history resembles awadh lies at old lucknow ..place for picnic sight scene and friends masti but lot of pollution (couples)
107,"Clearly lots of history, but not the best",This place carries totally historical memory. We came for weekend and enjoyed at this place while coming at Lucknow.
108,Interesting,Residency is a historical place - is a group of official buildings and dwellings of British rulers in Lucknow. It is located in old part of the town. it's a landmark place and in ruins. Earlier 'Light & Sound' show was used to organized in the evening here. It bears mark of First War of Indian Independence. It is closed on Monday. Persons interested in history of a place must visit the place.
109,Interesting,It is also a historical monument in Lucknow. It was the building where British Army was situated in Lucknow. Nice place
110,a visit worth  your time,This is a fairly quiet spot in the noisy city of Lucknow.  It even feels like an oasis. Lots of explanations on boards giving additional information about the history of this site.
111,Visit if you are a history buff,"Interesting historical site and building remains, of great significance to the fight for independence and the great mutiny of 1857"
112,Please don't miss this place,"Once a symbol of oppression, the Residency now stands, with an Indian flag, as a sobering reminder of the struggle for independence that was hard fought and of the ultimate sacrifice paid by so many. The walls, both inside and out, of the remains bare the scars of cannon and rifle shot from the harrowing siege of 1857."
113,Many things to improve ,Amazing and heritage type building for India British times this is museum type and can be cover in one hour
114,Great preview of the Indian independence struggle,The place is now lying in ruins but one can make out it's magnificence in the yester years.The Residency was the place of residence of the Several British officers during the Colonial rule.In the year 1857 during first war of Indian Independence the place was placed under the seige by Indian freedom fighters. The building was attacked mercilessly and the gunshot holes on the walls are silent witness to the attack.A must go place if u have any kind of interest in Indian freedom struggle and colonial rule.Must see light and sound show
115,Now a Ruin but worthy of a visit,Take a guided tour to learn about India and the British influence and their history. The park like grounds are well kept with ample information signs located around the site. Allow about an hour in the cool peaceful grounds. Interesting to see how the English tried to control India.
116,Great Historic Monument,"Extensive set of ruins showing all the signs of the siege. The museum has a very useful model showing the amazing original extend of the place. It definitely makes you think about what went on, when you are trying not to disturb the courting couples who occupy almost every corner that is."
117,Just dont miss this Place,Staying in Lucknow so decided to visit this place.  Its consists mainly of large buildings in ruins.  The museum located in the grounds is fairly interesting but not much to see. Strange to see 9 staff at a very small museum mmm! Buildings show evidence of cannon and rifle ball damage.
118,British residence ,It is a great historic monument. Well maintained. Site for many bollywood movies. Nice place to have picnic with family.
119,Peppered with shot and cannon balls,"Been a history lover I totally loved this place , I enjoyed visiting this place more than bada Imambara .History and ruins attracts .One will love to explore the stories that lies beneath the ruins ."
120,Residency Visit,"The British Residency, as the name suggests housed the families, of the British. This place bore the brunt of the mutiny of 1857. During the uprising, the Residency was laid seige by the Indian soldiers for several days. As the place was bombarded, the families including women and children took shelter inside the buildings. A number of them were massacred. The Residency is spread over a large area as it includes several buildings including a graveyard. The place is intriguing and has a feel  of colonial era."
121,Moving,It is one of the most visit place in Lucknow . But it is not quite well maintained and not clean too . I visited here with with my family.
122,Beautiful,Mind blowing place I visit the place my god such a historic place very good best environment the ford are my good many people come to visit the place the place so good I missed the chance to enter the museum because today is Friday and Friday is off day for museum if any one is planning to visit the place make min three hrs thank you must visit the place
123,Eyeopener,One of the great places to visit in Lucknow . Just loved it because of its peaceful environment . Overall its great.
124,Very nice residency,This is near by Qaiserbagh place in Lucknow but this is developed by Britishers and built heritage culture.
125,great,"It’s correct name is The Residency, not the British Residency. No one who visits Lucknow should fail to visit this place. It’s the site of the 1857 First War of Independence  when Indians and British clashed in bloody conflict resulting in horrific fatalities on both sides. Buildings were shattered and left as they were after the combat  providing a poignant memory of the battle. Although the site is sizeable, well maintained pathways render it easily walkable. There’s so much to see, so much to absorb and think about. The green spaces are well maintained, staff are pleasant and efficient. A sad period in history lingers on long in the memory. A small museum is attached with very interesting exhibits and displays that echo the conflict. One could spend a whole day here in pensive thought.  Lucknow City Corporation ( or whichever body is responsible for the site ) should be congratulated on a job well done."
126,One of the must see historical places,I was transported to the British Raj era. You get a feel of the sepoy mutiny. Strolling through the grounds you feel you are in a different world cut off from the din & bustle of the city.
127,One of the most memorable victorious Indian history,This sight is very moving bearing in mind what happened here. The opulence that used to prevail here must have been very difficult for the locals to bear. a must see here in Lucknow
128,Ruins from the Revolt,The residency is the historical location which used to be the British housing colony. This was the location where British Officer Inglis took shelter when the 1857 revoltees attacked the British cavalry. Although  the place is well maintained but the local gentry makes it a bit awkward to visit.
129,Mesmerising Ruins completed ignored,"Must see on your list if history interests you. Very well maintained and preserved structures. Depicts a very important part of Indian history, please read up before you visit or arrange a guide. Requires already 1-2 hours, opens at 10 and closes by 5:15 pm."
130,History untold ,"Situated on the banks of river Gomti, in center of Lucknow, the Residency, occupies an important position in history. In ruins today, it stands as silent witness to the brutal attack on the British during the 1857 uprising. It provides a glimpse to the living style of the British during those days. It is located close to other important landmarks of the city of that era."
131,Glimpse of History,"I was pleasantly surprised with the maintenance of the monument. It is very well maintained and a must visit place for any tourists in Lucknow. One should spend enough time to go through the place and it is better to have guide, who can explain you the stories. Such historical place without a guide makes it little less attractive."
132,nothing great...,A very large area of destroyed building dating from the first Indian uprising in the 18th century. A very frightening picture of destruction that we humans are capable of. It reminded me of Orador in southern France. It is well worth a visit just to see how much the Indians wanted to be free of colonial rule by us British and I for one can understand this. Although eerie it is quite beautiful in it own way.
133,Sobering!,The ruins are well preserved and reminds of freedom struggle 1857 .Britishwere well dug in but the freedom fighters were ruthless.very sad to know that a large numbers of ladies and children died during this struggle.Should visit on any week day except Friday.Museum well kept .A must visit while in  Lucknow
134,History preserved,"British colonialism at its best and worst.  Beautifully and empathetically kept site.  Peaceful and inspiring.  You could not help but be moved by the many graves of the British who lost their lives during the seige. Again, nothing about the place suggests any rancour towards the British by the Indian people - more an air of respect."
135,You need to see it to believe it!,Enjoyed the history of 1857 and saw the museum but missed the light and sound  show and all the walls talks about the history if one really wants to what happened that time
136,mesmerising and peaceful,Enjoyed my time here exploring the ruins. Site is well maintained and its very though provoking to see the battle scarred walls and to visit the cemetery where those who died in the 1857 siege were buried. Museum itself is very poor. Gardens are lush and green. A must for all visitors to Lucknow.
137,Flash back into FIRST WAR OF INDEPENDENCE,A facinating place.  It's just ruins but there is so much to learn from here.  The history is incredible and facinating.  It's very clean - a few stray dogs but this is part and parcel of India generally.  It's well worth a couple of hours having a walk around.
138,Taste History ,loved the greenery and the neatness of this very old place.went back in the times of the sepoy mutiny.i was impressed by how well kept the place is with lots of places to sit in the shade of the tree and clean restrooms to use.
139,Must visit place soaked up in history,Essential visit for all you First War of Independence (AKA The Indian Mutiny of 1857) buffs. Relaxing quiet walk around the parkland setting amidst the ruins of the Residency buildings. You can still see the bullet holes and effects of canon fire on the walls of the buildings.
140,The history of Lucknow ,A must visit for every tourist who is interested in the history of this historical city ....the monument soread over a very large area has been beautiful maintained & the museum gives you a complete insight to the place ...keep at least two hours if you want to do justice tp the place and also capture some amazing pictures.
141,Remind you of old times,"This is Historical place of Lucknow. You can see sign of bullet , Bomb on the walls of Residency at the the time of British period during war. It has good Museum of British period"
142,Monuments ,This place is mentioned in history books. it has a great importance with 1857 freedom fight.Marks bullets of that era is still live here. seems this place was left by british just yesterday.it consist of the ruins of old palace with chota imambara.
143,Historic importance of Lucknow ,Its a good place to visit in lucknow. This is one of tyhe most famous historical place. It has its good garden .One should must visit this place with their family or friends.
144,Garden with historical relics,It's a nice heritage place. Place full with sculpture of british era. You can visit the place for some heritage view.
145,"Remains from the outbreak of the ""Indian Mutiny""",I especially wanted to see this to understand the situation during the siege. It is worth knowing the history of the battle before going as I found the guide content to just explain what the building were. Only half of the original property is available for inspection as the army uses the rest but the holes made by the cannon shot and musket fire is very visible and reading the grave markers brings alive the daily life of the resident during the bombardment.Definitely worth seeing.
146,great cold basement and ammunition,"I always wanted to visit this place to get a feel of how the whole 1857 scenario was . I had been to Lucknow many times on work but always it was rush-rush and so about a month ago I got lucky in that I was able to spend about half an hour in the complex , sweating my guts out under an overcast sky and humid atmosphere. The place is historic and could do with some pamphlets. Overall its is fairly well maintained barring thescribbles of amorous couples on various walls which are out of the view of the security staff; the place seems to e a hangout for the couples as the entry fee of rs 20 is nothing . I would definitely suggest a longer visit of about at least 2 hours or so to get a good feel of the place."
147,Huge compound,Enjoyed the memories of the the great history of the great Indian bravery amd the battles of freedom.
148,Ruins of Raj-era architecture ,"Highly recommend visiting this site. A true slice of Indian History which you can feel as you walk though the site. Good signage which tells you what building each was, and a bit of the people and history of the 1857 uprising."
149,KHANDDAR BATATE HAI KI IMMARAT KABHI SUNDER THI ...,This place is in 33 Acar and huge place. Its really good for those who have interest in Archaeology and history. That was built some more than 250 years ago.When we asked the watchman about the guide. He explain some details and told us that every builiding outside history of that written and you don't need guide there.Really we appreciate  his frankness and polite ness.It has mesueme which can be visited.
150,Worth a visit,This is a special place with a tragical past but a hopeful future. I would recommend going in the early morning. It gets quite hot and humid at the end of day.
151,Nice!,Its good place for visitors specially for history lovers and students. Its give many information about history.
152,Dont go if you are with family,"To explore lucknow with some friends we decided to visit some old and historic structures of the city and we were amazed to find that our city contains such wonderful places.  Residency is very peaceful , beautiful place. You can feel the pulse of freedom moment. It's green , clean and calm. Need more attention from authorities to maintain the place"
153,Old but gud enough,There are many reminders that history has left us with which haunt us till date with things that really cut a sorry figure for Humanity. While this monument reminds of the revolt simultaneously it shares with us the horrors of war also. But all in all a place to get peace and understand what is the benefit of peace.
154,Well preserved,"The British Residency  is known to have provided refuge to the Britishers in the uprising at the First War of Independence and  has been a witness to the famous revolt of 1857, that shook the then-British regime.  During the revolt, many of the Britishers in Residency died due to an epidemic that broke out. The construction of this residency was started by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula of Awadh in the year 1775 and completed by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan . Thus, this complex became to be a residential area for the British, who were stationed in the Awadh region. Today, the complex houses a museum, which has lithographs, paintings as well as  photographs of the previous time."
155,History Embedded/ Recovered from Excavations,"The compound encompasses the ruins of the British Resident's home in Lucknow which was attacked by Indian soldiers in the British Indian Army, when the revolted against their British officers. There is also a small but interesting museum."
156,Pleasant time spent....,"This was the home to the British governor before independence ,it has several beautiful rooms,lawns ,which are still maitained very well by the govt,and it has several footfalls daily .this was the venue of the first war of independence from the british,so it has historical and emotive value for Indians and for lucknow people .do take a guide ,he will help by a detailed survey and stories related to the place.also visit the museam ,where there are cannon balls of that time,artifacts,pictures ,paintings"
157,Very interesting visit to an historic site,"The British Residency is situated at the bank of river Gomti in old Lucknow, during the first Indian revolts period the Britishers were residing in the Residency were attacked and many killed by common Indian people. You can see many hole marks of bullets on the walls of Residency. It's a must visit historical place in Lucknow...."
158,Hidden Gem,Architecturally it's a nice place to see but we didn't enjoy here since it carries the memories of one of the darkest chapter of Indian history. It has been maintained very nicely but the authorities. A must-see for the history buffs.
159,A Historical Monument,"Had seen a glimpse of the British Residency in Lucknow in a Bengali film sometime ago. Hence, I wanted to see the Residency in person when I next visited the city. Am so glad that I did!Such splendid grounds that has been maintained immaculately. Have atleast a couple of hours in hand if you really wish to take your time and get a feel of the place. The historical facts are given alongside the ruins. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in the 1800s....."
160,Must Visit,"This is a complex of buildings which served as a political and residential base for the British officers and diplomats engaged with the princely state of Awadh. Of such kinds of complexes spread over British India, this one is famous for being under siege during the Uprising of 1857. The ruins bear the marks of battle and the graves of the departed.The lawns are impeccably well maintained and a few hours of peace and leisure spent here are well worth it. There is a small museum. Bags must be deposited at a locker facility before entering the museum. Chilled drinking water and good restroom facilities are available. However the authorities must consider appointing well trained guides to give information about the place."
161,Reminds of India's first war of Independence,"If there is a place in Lucknow where I can go again and again,its the residency.It has a bloody past which is still visible today.And for those not interested in history,its a peaceful place amidst the chaotic surroundings of Lucknow."
162,Back to British era,There’s loads fo history here and the story of the siege and deaths of thousands makes for interesting reading. The ruins themselves though didn’t rock my boat that much. The museum doesn’t rate a visit unless you are a big fan of Indian dioramas.
163,Lucknow Visit,A must see to learn about the British in Lucknow to see where and how they lived and what took place there. Allow a lot of time for this visit and go with a tour guide one who can tell you the history
164,British legacy.,This is now treating as a love spot by couples . park is in the middle of lucknow city and this place is sign of first war of independence.MUST VISIT THIS PLACE HISTORY LOVERS!!
165,Good place,It was a living place for British general. Beautiful and well maintained. Banquet hall is the best place here
166,neat and clean and so green,"Ruins of the British mini city built by the nawabs for the Beitish resident , excellently preserved and landscaped.What was meant to be the residents residence alone went on to cover 33 acres and housed a huge banquet hall, a hospital,an armory, a treasury and so on.Most buildings still stand though without exception all have their roofs demolished to ensure they were never rebuilt again.This was in 1857 when the premises were under siege for 87 days and cannonballs were fired from outside by the mutinous Strangely it also has a begum mahal which was built by a christian begam of the nawab.No guides are available but there are sign boards everywhere which are self explanatory. The Tourism department employees are helpful but hard to trace.A must see on a lucknow visit."
167,Lovely gardens and interesting history,In the first war of Independence.. British residency became the symbol of British resistance to outside invasion.. British stood ground and ate rats disposed their dead in wells to survive .. and finally emerged victorious against the army of queen of Lucknow.. indeed a spectacular story
168,British Residency complex,"The British Residency is the place where the British made their last stand in 1857, with the rebelling Indian sepoys baying for their blood. It's history that can be seen!"
169,Took me back in time!,Very good and soothing place to be with family and siblings. Big gardens old memorial buildings silently speaking about the revolt of 1857.
170,Good Destination,This is very old one but nothing special over here. The garden where it is located is well maintained.
171,HISTORY IS MISSING.....,Visited remains of buildings of British Residency. Good efforts to preserve the structures right from revolt of Indian soilders against Britishers in 1857. There are signs of bullets on the walls. Salute to those unknown Indian freedom fighter soilders. Worth visiting.
172,The past becomes present ,British residency is the place where British used to stay while they ruled India. Now most of the building are ruined and open places are covers with garden grass. Lots of plantation of different types of trees. Along with that place has become lovers meeting point so sometimes expect unexpected. Home for some of the oldest and largest trees in UP.
173,Reminiscent of 1857 Revolution,"The grounds with greenery surrounding relics are very well maintained. It is a nice place to walk about on a sunny winter day. For those interested in architecture and restoration, the building remains are valuable.Also check out the books on sale at the kiosk just inside the gate.Authentic guide service would be valuable."
174,Hope I will be there in British Period,"Now referred as Residency, this complex is situated near the Lucknow high court and consists of various buildings build by the nawabs of Lucknow and was later occupied by the British. It was attacked during the revolt of 1857 and much like the Jallianwala bagh memorial, its ruined walls draw reminiscence of the epic battle."
175,Visiting Residency,"Acually British residency are mosetly beautiful ruins. For people with a great imagination, you can have a glimps of how was it looking back in the days. Museum is under renowation so its not that impresive. You can make there nice photos thou."
176,Sight seeing,This place really need some professional guides appointed by government. The inscription written on bord doesn't connect visitors with the historical importance of that place.it's just  became a photo shoot place with some demolished buildings.I prefer that you should googled the history and then visit the residency it'll give you a creepy feeling.....
177,A must visit site,"As you enter through the gate and read about the first sepoy mutiny of 1857 a chill runs through your spine taking you back that era. As you take a quiet walk through the park you will be able to see pieces o history lying at every corner.  For a history buff the place is not less than a gold mine. Almost each monuments(remains of) have been superbly preserved by the ASI with there apt description. You will be able to see the kitchen area, the praying area, rooms used by particular Captain Routleff, the Banquet hall and many more. As you walk around the place it feels the war is taking place in front of your eyes. A place not to be missed if you are at Lucknow."
178,Photography,Best Historical place in north india. if traveler visit lucknow he/she must go to Residency. Its just near to Kaisarbagh Bus Stand. U will surprised with the maintenance of this monument. When u reached their u will realize the indian history (Revolt of 1857). Traveler must see the residency museum.
179,Not too bad,The Residency was the official residence of the Governor of Lucknow during the British Raj. Walk around the complex at leisure and take in the historic events the place witnessed first hand during the violent days of the first Indian uprising of 1857. The museum is especially interesting.  It has a collection of old paintings and lithographs - the only source of understanding the residency complex as it was  during the days of the British Raj
180,Good Place,Amazing place and lot of history behind the place is just mind blowing . Bullet holes are visibly seen . Huge Banquet which hosted lavish british parties and Royals in past coming down to ruins was saddening but also amazing to see the pristine artwork which showed the creativity & showcased indian culture .
181,"We all need to remember history, not to repeat the tragedy...","The Residency was the centrepiece during the seige of Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny or 1st war of Indipendance. It has been maintained in ruins, and is a stark reminder of the Colonial past. The museum (closed Fridays) is worth a trip round. It is set in parkland, and makes a good walk. Don't usually do cemeteries, but the one here is worth a visit to see the mixture of deaths during the seige, both in action and by disease."
182,ok ok place,Good views. The history behind the place was a good learning point so do get a guide with you to get the whole experience
183,Don't miss it,It’s old place where British use to stay as name says “ British Residency” In 1857 got damaged due to war. It’s ok for one time visit
184,Residency,"british residency is situated near the shaheed smarak, this is very old, this is god not bad but nothing special."
185,Historic,Excellent for history buffs. Each ruin in the residency has a story to tell. Too hot in the summer months
186,Must visit location in Lucknow,the stories around this place are interesting... and glad that the govt is taking care of this... certainly worth spending time walking through time and grandeur of British Raj living
187,Very interesting,If you know anything about the British in India then you will be well aware of the siege of Lucknow and the Residency.It covers 33 acres in total and has many many features relating to the two sieges.Contains a small museum with interesting artefacts.
188,Such a beautiful place crying for attention.,"Go back in the times of the Raj! Experience the violence of 1857 and feel the adrenaline rush in your spine.A must visit place for all, when in Lucknow."
189,A day well spent,"The remains of the Residency, left largely as they were after the siege of Lucknow, are well worth a visit to get a sense of the extravagant lifestyles of the East India Company representatives and a modern take on what Brits know as the Indian Mutiny but the Indians call The First War of Independence. Interesting, thought-provoking and impressive."
190,A beautiful and brutal part of Indian history,Nice place for photography and admiring the beauty of nature. Very excellence art and architecture. Vintage look
191,Old but good,The place is important in history and canon marked walls abound but it's a ruin and the museum is a let down
192,Amazing,British Regency buildings are old and shows British legacy in Lukhnow. It is great for walking around. Buildings are falling and not maintained.
193,Unexplored Colonial world,A clean well maintained place considering Indian historic places how they are maintained.  15 buck entry fee for Indians and 200 bucks for foreign nationals. Open from sunrise to sunrise and the musuem is open till 1630hrs.Well the place is in very dilapidated condition but the place/garden is well maintained. The musuem do not allow any kind of bags and have a locker to keep them at the entrance. I really didn't understand why they don't allow bags inside as they don't have anything of great importance inside the musuem. The musuem has few paintings and some letters and few broken plates kept on display. One can laze around in the compound and enjoy the sight of birds and squirrels.
194,A glimpse of India's first war for Independence,"A collection of ruins and gardens with a bloody history.  To say it has such a violent past, I found it a peaceful place to wander round.  Found the museum in there to be a bit disappointing."
195,Witness of first Independence war 1857,Nice Place But not Maintained Properly. Offer a lot of Potential to become a must Tourist Destination if Properly Maintained.
196,History of both sides,"After around 20-odd work visits to Lucknow, finally managed to make it to the Residency. It is a great place to take a walk, looking over the ruins of what was once the place to be in Lucknow. The grandeur of the place can only be imagined, but if you just think about it, you can hear the glasses clinking when they had their parties in the banquet hall or the sound of the bullets crashing into the walls of the buildings during the revolution and the cannon balls being fired in defense. The vast grounds make for a very pleasant walk amongst the greenery."
197,must see attraction ,this place was very great . its only not these pics . it includes very nice places to take photos . I wish you enjoying ur time
198,A beautiful walk down British history ,"Beautifully kept place, quite in contrast to the rest of the city. The buildings still bear the stigmata of shelling that occurred during the uprising and are a hark back to how things might have been back in the day. There are descriptive plaques providing insight into the mutiny and a small museum with lithographs dating to the Raj - giving a glimpse into how life was back in those days and at that time in particular. A must see for anyone interested in Indian history."
199,Glimpse of British raj,"I have visited this several times and have seen it from delapitated conditions to well preserved structures now. It has the history from the 1857 mutiny, which is well preserved."
200,A hidden gem most visitors miss,One Must visit this place in Lucknow. It is with in the city and well communicate. It occupies a vast area and it's well maintains. One can get to see the ruins of British colonies which were demolished by our National Freedom fighter. It Carries Some heart wrenching    moments during the sepoy mutiny.
201,Memorial of 1857,"I travelled here for peace moments. This place is quite and not good for family trips. You can visit once, so you can see the British creation."
202,Ruins of British Empire,Very well kept grounds it is like walking back in time.  Well signposted with plenty of information that you can read at leisure.
203,Silent witness,"What an incredible place, beautifully kept and a very quiet and serene experience in contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city. Well worth the visit"
204,Reminds the great uprising of 1857 in Lucknow,British residency is a group of several buildings and was served as the residency for british resident general ...very neat and greeny area ..very happy to see the place
205,Nice residence ,"This site has been very well restored from the ruins which I saw in 1985. The restoration preserves the primary structures giving a feel of history. The small entry fee is well worth it, and includes admission to the 1857 museum. There are good facilities for visitors, if your visit is in the evening, there is a light-and-sound show,"
206,Interesting piece of Indian History,"Residency is a reminiscent of the British Rule in India, made to house the British General who served with the Nawabs of Awadh. The buildings are mostly in ruin but give a glimpse of the older eras gone by. There is a mosque and a museum inside the premises. The museum is open till 5pm and cameras/phones are not allowed."
207,History revealed,"This place is popular for revolution of 1857. Nice historical place, very good for all class of people."
208,Nice view ,its good for history lovers. near river gomti.very popular with tourists. peaceful. needs more care and maintenance.
209,Another walk into history!,"not much to see here i guess 10 min is enough for this place but yes its clean,  calm, well maintained no ticket for this place but the care taker will take you around tell about the history"
210,Sad and melancholy place with a tortured history.,Visit this historical place  accompanied by a good guide that can explain and tell you all the legends and anecdots of the first Indian Independence war in 1857. Without the explanation the place is only a nice park...do not loose the opportunity to know the interesting history of this place.
211,Freedom struggle ,This building was built by British in the 19th Century as their residency in Lucknow. This building was attacked by the Freedom fighters during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. There are bullets and shells marks seen through out the building. It was great to be at a place which marked the war between our freedom fighters and British.
212,Hangout at historic monuments of Lucknow,If you don't know your history then you will appreciate the tour around the British residency full of interesting facts and stories. You won't believe the vastness of this place and the museum is well worth visiting too although not essential. Definitely go with a guide to learn more about what happened during the siege and how they lived.
213,So much history and a large green area to boot,We spent a couple of hours here while we stayed in Lucknow. I was very keen to visit the site of the siege and it exceeded my expectations. There is far more to see than I expected. It is well worth a visit. There is s video about the events leading up to the siege which was well done.
214,NW India tour,"The Residency is a vast area and most of it is in ruins. If you are someone who loves a slice of history, this place will give you a sense of history. It's a long walk around, so wear comfortable shoes."
215,A Place in History,"It was the residency of Britishers before 1857 revolt  but was burnt by freedom fighters during the war. Now it is developed as garden where people come and enjoy as picnic spot. It is situated near Hazaratganj and Gomti River and opp. to this monument, Shaheed Smarak situated where people can enjoy boating in Gomti River"
216,Average Place,"We were not prepared for the scale and melancholy of the place. Ideal way for a history buff to spend a winter afternoon walking and ambling around the Residency. The living quarters of the colonial regalia, the banquet house, the museum, the great banyan tree and then the cemetery where some of those who braved the siege that lasted close to two months during the 1857 uprising are buried. The place is very well maintained, clean, open and beautifully landscaped. A must do while in Lucknow as a traveler"
217,A slice of history,"I visited here recently with my friends, this place is old but good to visit, people come here to spend some time in peace."
218,Poignant,This place was build by one of the Nawab of Lucknow to accomodate British in Lucknow. Once recognised by government in late 90s have been maintained well. It also have got many symbols of cross firing between British and Fredom Fighters.
219,seeped in history coming alive.,"Well worth a visit to learn about the British ruling at the time and how things all came to be , always good to go with a guide as they can give you the background to what you are looking at"
220,A visit in history,I had limited time to tour the British Residency but I am glad I took some time out to finally visit the place. It took me back in time and I could really visually what it must have been like in 1857. Archaeological survey is doing a marvelous job in maintaining this heritage site in Lucknow and I will recommend it as a must visit destination if one visits Lucknow.
221,Important historical site,"The Residency, also called as the British Residency is a group of several buildings in the heart of Lucknow. It served as the residence for the British Resident General who was a representative in the court of the Nawab.   The British residence was a place that served as a refuge for approximately 3,000 British residents during the 1857 Uprising. Almost 90 days lasted a siege in which about 2000 people were killed. Ruins of the Residence, in memory of the events of those days, are left in the same form in which they were after the siege was lifted on November 17th."
222,Ruins and Graves,"Magnificent fort with beautiful surroundings, lots of green and free cold drinking water and rest room. this place is only for 10 Indian Rupee and I think Its the big deal in Lucknow !!!"
223,Historical,After the Bada Imaambara this is the place one should not miss if you are interested in a piece of history. The ruins of old british quaters are spread across a large area. Also a good place to experiment some architectural photography competitions.
224,History amidst ruins,Relive the lives of those who once lived laughed and loved in what is now a ruin.  There is the banquet hall where  young soldiers and their ladies must have dined in style and danced the night away.  In the musuem there are artifacts that have survived the ravages of time some of them cracked and broken. Takes you back in time to another place and time
225,"British Residency, Lucknow","Constructed by Nawab Saadat ali Khan between 1780 to 1800 AD, these buildings saw 1857 viplav where Englishmen were kept in abundance & many buildings still have bullet marks. Small museum & show in evening are nice."
226,The residency,Yet another must see in India. Good signage and a small but fascinating museum. Again took much longer to explore than we thought.
227,Visit to Residency,"The museum has been refurbished, and is a must-see for history buffs. Lawns well maintained by the ASI. Best to visit in winter."
228,1857 war and role of Awadh,This is excellence of my tour guide of Tornos group Vast area of land -a city in a city .Cunningly the East India Co exploitation of the  situation. 1857 The great Indian mutiny .-the recollections for the nation . A national monument
229,Must do for history fans but otherwise ruined ,The British Residency has a lot of history and sprawls over an expansive campus. More like ruins than monuments. Very little information available in terms of signboards or plaques. Good place to take a stroll but best to read up before visiting.
230,Good for history buffs,Lovely place. The ruins tell you how beautiful the Residency must have been been decades ago.  Good place to spend some time.  The booking in charge was well informed of the place.
231,Well maintained - Historical place ,"If u wanna Visit some historic place of british rule then u can visit this place . Visit in a group otherwise u will get bored . Not to see much , but good when u visit when friends"
232,Good clean historic campus,"The British Residency, rather haunting if not haunted, was the living quarters of the East India Company at the courts of the Nawabs. The buildings were destroyed during the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. What is left of the buildings is still rather imposing. At times while in the ruins, pandemonium of shy, green parakeets flew away as soon as they perceived my presence."
233,The fight for freedom started here,"This is awesome colony and a great place, architecture  of the whole place was classic. must visit place if u are in pune."
234,A walk through the pages of history,"Relatively centrally located, the residency ruins are now zoned as a city park with a small museum inside (composed of one of the less ruined houses, cooled by fans and has a small cinema screening room for educational clips). Admission to the park (includes small museum) is 500 rupees per head for foreigners. If you like photography, you can easily spend  hours and make the ticket price worth it by shooting the sunset at the park -- the ruins gives it a certain atmosphere. If you are more interested in the history, go see the small museum and bullet & cannonball holes, though for the history you will have to ask around and read beyond visiting the park. There should be guided available too -- though as I entered the park almost at closing time, I don't recall seeing them. There is a catch. There are very few places for shade or to hide against the rain. Bring your own umbrella. Also bring your own water -- no shops inside to sell you more water or water-refills. Museum cloak room service (mandatory, if you come with s backpack) is in a shed outside of the museum building. The ticket check at the door will point you to it. But you may want to bring your own water bottle with you to go inside the museum: again, fan-cooled."
235,Historic Value.,Historical palace hai or agar frnd or family ke sath visit kar Skte hai or pic click Kare so lots of enjoy ...
236,Good place to visit....,"Spread over an area of 30 acres,  the ruins stand testimony to what that place was. there is also a museum which gives complete info about the place. one can spend a good 2 hours to see the whole complex."
237,The Old Raj,The sprawling gardens and roads were very well maintained and lovely place to just walk around taking in the history and ambience of the place. The old houses and rooms were well documented and no guides needed to check out the place where the British had their stronghold in the city about 150 years ago.There is also the museum which was a pleasure to visit.
238,HISTORY,"Great place to relax, commune with nature in the heart of an overpopulated and extremely congested city. The monuments are excellent and the gardens are very relaxing."
239,A place with great historical significance.,"Residency Lucknow also called as British Residency Complex. There are savral damaged buildings. Residency still has within its walls, the graves of around 2000 British soldiers who died in the Revolt of 1857. Inner side a small museum shows culture of that time. Residency situated in the center of Lucknow."
240,History calls,very good for vistors very good for foreign travellers cheap ticket and good ancient building of 1700's
241,A Historical Place in Lucknow,"With my new friend, Harish, we visited the Residency ruins. Foreigners have to pay much more then Indians. It was a hot burning summer day, 45 degrees Celsius. He was on jeans and his sweats were streaming down... But we still had a good time walking around the ruins. A couple of British monuments dedicating to their solders and generals defending the residence in Indian land! The museum is small, a few historically significant people's portraits hanging in the main hall. There is a mosque inside the residence compound."
242,Unique historical walk through the British times ,"I had read histories of the ""Indian Mutiny"" of 1857, known locally as the First War of Independence, when the British residents of Lucknow fled for safety to the British Residency, where they were besieged. I had always imagined the big house, with outbuildings, and some fortifications. But I had not realised that the Residency was a whole township of buildings, including the summer residence and mosque of the Nawab who built it and gave the land to the British Resident (Chief Administrator). The remains of these buildings are kept as a national monument to the Indian sepoys who turned on their British masters and fought for their independence. Of course, as usual, the actual history is far more complicated than its basic outline.The buildings and memorials told a tale of bravery and loss on both sides. There is a small museum, with a short video to outline the story, and a few noticeboards around the site to explain the different buildings. However, the information is far from comprehensive, and the museum could benefit from more modern displays. Overall, it is a fascinating place to visit, and one leaves with pangs of sympathy for all those involved in its history."
243,One of the most authentic British Raj destination,we went there with our car+driver+guide as part of the tour and saw the short movie and took lots of photos also.
244,Historical place,"A very good place to visit, covered with greenery!! You will feel nature with you here!!Must visit!!Awesome place!!"
245,Historical site in Lucknow,Nothing much left but still the ruins will give you thrill thinking about those days. Should avail a guided tour instead of going alone.
246,A must visit place at Lucknow ,"poignant and excellent.  Beware of some guides who might give a biased view of what occurred during the Indian Mutiny - Fortunately, we were well aware of the history and also that the British didn't come out squeaky clean at the end - but the Residency has been well preserved and was definitely a highlight of our trip."
247,Quiet oasis in the city,"I would strongly advice to have read about this place, its history in detail before venturing into it , as it has such a close connection with the Indian independence struggle . This was the place of residence for the ranking British officer and his group for the court of nawab of awadh. It was built during the period of 1780-1800 and consists of several buildings in a sprawling acres. It is situated at the middle of the city and is well connected . This building was the centre of Attack during the 1857 siege of Lucknow and you can see the bullet holes , cannon holes in the building . After gaining the building back the British chose to abandon it and from 1920 has been maintained as heritage monument . The building and its surroundings are a huge structure and a casual walk will take close to 3 hours to complete . It is very well maintained and for casual eye it is pleasing . Beautiful gardens which did me lots of ""me"" time . I spent time lazing around after the hectic tour of the majestic buildings of Lucknow in the morning . For  serious eye , this collection is a wonder of time gone by . The building has been left as it is and you can imagine yourself as part of the struggle and what could have been , I am not sure this has been used in any movies! Wonder ful place to capture the life which went by . This is a place which should not be missed when you are in Lucknow . Do take precaution to be hydrated ."
248,Thought provoking monument,It's good. Really good. Has a lot of things to see and also a museum. Gives a good glimpse of the British phase of India and Civil Engineering of that time.Has a nominal entry fee of maybe ₹20.Not a good place to visit alone. Go with friends or family. Not very crowded and is generally peaceful.Closes around 6:30 p.m.
249,Haunting reminder of the disturbances of 1857,"I wish I had more time to spend in this place. The museum also closed by the time we reached. It is old but the grounds are impeccably kept. Also, the buildings take you back to the british era. It is not very crowded but holds a vital part in our history. Do visit this awesome place."
250,Its ok...,Enjoyed wandering through these ruins and learning the history of them.A lovely quiet oasis to enjoy an hour or so away from the noise and crowds.
251,The place where the British Sepoy mutiny started in 1857.,This is ruined structure taken to us British Colonial era in India. So must see museum at the site and take walk around it.
252,History revisited,"When I visited the Residency I could feel that the bricks and plaster of each building were taking to us. They whispered the events of 1857 and on one hand I felt proud for the first freedom fighters of India who tasted freedom for 86 days, and felt the pain of so much bloodshed on the other. I spend about 3 hours in the place and would have loved to spend more."
253,Bullet marks of first Indian war of independence,"This was the residence of the British general during the Nawab's rule. It was constructed during the rule of Nawaab Sadat Ali Khan, the fifth nawab of the province around 1800 AD"
254,Indian history ,The Residency now exists as ruins. Also called British Residency built for British Resident General who was a representative in the court of the Nawab Sadat Ali Khan II
255,Walk into history.,It's a residence of British during the 1850 decades but during 1857  freedom fighting  it was burned by  freedom fighters. It's is just a monument and as a architectural point of view u can visit this place.
256,Revisit History,"It's an easy walk around, but a beautiful place where ruins make beautiful frames. Worth  a visit for photography,\Toilets are available, benches are there to rest. drinking water is available."
257,UNIQUE HISTORY OF THE BRITISH RAJ,If history interests you than visit this place. Ruins and only of historical interest. Nothing much activity .
258,A grim reminder of the Indian Sepoy Mutiny in 1857. Very interesting.,You can take a leisurely walk down the vast property after your heavy lunch from Tunday Kababi (see my review please). It brings you a certain calmness. And the fading reddish sun light adds a zing to your photos. Feel the bricks and construction wonders from the British. The canon couple are additional treats to the eyes while the bullet marks on wall feel otherwise. A must visit in Lucknow.
259,Colonial era of Lucknow,It was amazing revisiting this place with my kids spent almost 3hrs with them. Took them to each of the buildings across the Residency.One lost opportunity - the muskets uniforms from the in-house museum missing - the top floor had limited information except for the model built-up map.
260,Great place to soak in the history of the siege of Lucknow,This place is all lit..You can visit here any time specially at the time of festival..You may enjoy every bit...Children can play their fav games..
261,From the British era in India!,The architecture was a real mix as you could have been looking at ruins in Greece or Italy but instead you were in India.  Our guide gave us a very indepth insight into the history of the residency.  There is also a museum on site that you can visit.  Loved walking around the cemetery as it told a story all of its own.  Not very often visited by tourists but really should be as the history is quite incredible.
262,"Nice park very well preserved, with ruins of the British Residency",british residency is in near shaheed smarak and bapu bhawan earlier i used to go there with my younger brother. british residency has a little fair tickets and vahicles charges is extra you will have to pay.british residency has unique  and old monuments of ancient ages. all types of biggest photos also kept for public information.it has unique location.
263,Great place .! ,"This is such an important and beautiful place but due to negligence and poor up keep, it is getting dirty and ruined. Wish the government could do something about it. This place transports you back to the British Era, it is so stunning and so wonderful to visit it."
264,place for who love history,The seat of the British Resident in erstwhile Awadh or as the goras said Oudh. If the walls could talk there would be many stories especially of the Great Indian Mutiny. Large open gardens with a well laid path and an interesting museum. Large British cannon on display. Also a place for lovers to gather and neck.
265,Where it all began....,British residence is famous landmark in hesitory many people visiting to see that residence and it is good looking
266,White raj,"For those of you who have read a lot about Colonial History in any part of the world you would be able to recreate that past by just reliving those moments standing in the amidst the two and three storeyed structures riddles with cannon ball, bullet, shelling and mortar holes.... with the just the side walls left and huge columns or pillars that were a standard in any of the British styled government buildings. This structure with many buildings in and around the British Resident's home and Office that has  stood the test of time took the brunt of the Uprising of 1857 or the First War of India's Independence. This is one of the greatest landmarks of that time and needs to be popularised with the younger generations to enable them to have a purview of India's past"
267,Fascinating Peace of History,This place is old but very gud.People came here to spent some tym in peace.Me and my husband went there and so much of fun.
268,historical monument and good to visit,"Beautifully maintained! Go with a good, knowledgeable guide who can give you the background and history. We enjoyed it."
269,Interesting for history buffs,"What is baffling is that there is no material to explain this place, a guide or some literature at the entrance would be helpful. These are ruins of a once flourishing place. There is no roof for many structures, however, the place is maintained clean and tidy."
270,So much history to learn,Historical place to see and spend some time. Shooting place for many movies. You need to buy tckt but you can do without a guide. There is also a museum inside.
271,1857 war history of bygone British glory,"This was a british residence with arms factory and spot for hanging of then fridom fighter, this was destroyed by indian fridom fighters during 1857 revolt, now this place is known as residency which is a sign of revolt, this is also a graveyard of britishers murdered during then revolt."
272,A genuine slice of history ,"We visited the British Residency in February 2018.  The grounds were extensive and beautiful, and the ruins were impressive.  We were fortunate to have a guide with us, who grew up and lived across the road from the residency, so he was very familiar with the ruins and their history.  We visited on a Friday, and were unable to enter the museum, but we were able to learn about the history of the Residency through our guide.  The ruins are well maintained, but you can still see the damage sustained during the war.  I would highly recommend taking a tour with a guide in this location to gain the most from your visit."
273,Steeped into history - a peaceful oasis from the otherwise chaotic city,"Spend time in understanding each and every Building inside the Residency. Some restoration has been done and some is underway. Most of the Ceilings are gone but the old Wooden Planks ( 250-300 yrs old) tell the Grandeur of the Buildings. The Museum inside the Residency, though small, has a lot to tell to History lover's. It now has turned into a modern lover's paradise because of low Entry Fees and the protection it provides."
274,HISTORIC,"If you know of or are interested in the 1857 Mutiny (or first war of independence if you're Indian) this is a fine place to visit to see the sight of one of the famous sieges in that troubled period. Many of the buildings in this large park have been left as they from that day and seeing the round shot & musket ball marks in the half destroyed buildings brings the history to life, as does the small graveyard. It is all set in a pleasant and tranquil garden area."
275,"British Residency, 19 Sep'15","I went to this place with my friend and his family, this place is not bad, this place have a museum,"
276,Nice historical place,"It was a Sunday morning that we stepped out to explore the Old Heritage of the city, as we prepared ourselves for this we stopped at Chowk to enjoy the Lakhnawi Breakfast and set ourselves for the visit, after round of Awadhi monuments we went ahead and reached the erstwhile British Residency, inhabited by Britisher East India Company Officers untill the mutiny of 1857,The remains remind of the various office complexes of British Company, places where they socialized and spent family evening the Dance and Banquet Area along with a place earmarked for the treasury. All in all a visit worth making, took us back in time and reminded the important historical incidents."
277,A trip into the past,"The Residency now exists in ruins  It was constructed during the rule of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan II,who was the fifth Nawab of the province of Awadh .The construction took place between 1780 to 1800 AD and served as the residence for the British Resident General who was a representative in the court of the Nawab. In 1857 the place witnessed a prolonged battle which is also known as Siege of Lucknow; The Residency has been maintained as it was at the time of the final relief, and the shattered walls are still scarred by cannon shot. Even since Indian Independence, little has changed. The ruined building is surrounded by lawns and flowerbeds and is a tourist attraction nowadays. The cemetery at the nearby ruined church has the graves of 2000 men, women and children, including that of Sir Henry Lawrence who died during the siege.There is a weathered epitaph near the grave of Sir Henry that reads ""Here lies the son of Empire who tried to do his duty"" while another nearby grave reads ""Do not weep my children, for I am not dead, but am sleeping here."" A light and sound show to show display the history of the Residency is also played each evening.The monument is maintained by archaeological survey of india"
278,Historical Place,This seems to be a local makeout point ... We went at around 12 noon and there were endless couples getting cosy ... There seems no other reason why people come here so not at all a place for family and kids
279,Landmark of India's freedom struggle and Awadh empire revolution against English,"This place is wonderful! We went on a Saturday and it was not at all busy, just a few families taking a stroll. You can really feel the history and also see it in the bullet and cannonball holes. The museum was great too, there's a documentary shown daily in Hindi/English, not sure of the times, if you're lucky to be there at the right time. The gardens were clean and very well kept. The staff were friendly and very helpful indeed. Great and thanks!"
280,Historical place,"Revisited the Residency, which is maintained in a neat and clean condition, so was pleasantly surprised by that.  In the small museum, there is a useful diorama depicting the layout of the Residency before the siege."
281,British old stands,"Very well maintained ruins; a photographer 's delight, specially if one is into historical architecture. With a nominal entry fee, this place is worth spending an hour or two. Apart from residential quarters and army barracks, it also houses a mazaar and a temple, sprawling lawns. The museum is closed on Fridays, but it's a small one and nothing you would miss."
282,Can visit once,"read a little about the 1857 Mutiny - or, The First War of Independence - before you go.  You cannot but be impressed with the bravery on both sides, the determination to to be the victor.  The cemetery is very touching.  The buildings have been left in a state of ruin, but it only adds to the whole Gestalt.  the little museum is worth a few minutes."
283,Old is gold,An average place with a rich past... lawns are impeccably maintained...there is a basement for ammunition (now just an empty room) too...skippable
284,A ancient place ruins,"we had quite a long walk to get here, only to find out it was closes,  No time tables letting people know when there were open or closed. very disappointed. as never got to go in."
285,A fine British era ruins ,"well maintained place, with signboards telling us what each of the buildings were, but i wish there were more details....only when we visited the museum and saw the model of the Residency did one learn the details. Though there was a notice outside mentioning timings of the film show, but the staff inside were very hesitant in screening it....only when we insisted and called the Museum Manager, did they agree to screen the film"
286,Serenity with a lot of history ,"Well..now a days, this place is basically a nice garden with old falling structure which act for a hideout for d love making couple. Visit only if u r interested in history or want to make out with ur partner more exotically ..."
287,Great,Good for the photoshoot ( specially outdoor photoshoot ) gonna work for the outdoor photographers . Superb Place
288,Not Bad,Nice place to walk around and see the old buildings. The grounds are huge and you can spend a good few hours walking round seeing the buildings and watching the chipmunks play.The museum wasn't really worth the 10 minutes it took to deposit our bag before being allowed in.If you have been to the Hussainabad picture Gallery you have probably seen most of them.Overall a nice place with pretty gardens.
289,Old one but Nothing special,"Nice colonial era architecture, clean and neat.Ideally for couples ,the place was serene and beautiful"
290,OLD IS GOLD,The locations was so good and having beautiful place where we can make photographes which makes me to stay tgere
291,Glimpse into pre-independence era,"Lucknow British Residency is a summer palace built by Nawab of Audh, where representative of British East India Company used to reside with his family and member of staff to look after the British interest in Audh state. This practice of stationing one resident in the state of Audh started after the battle of Buxar (1874), in which Suja-ud-dalla the then  Nawab  of Audh  raised his arms against British East India Company but courted defeat.Company started clipping his wings.The British Residency bears a special meaning to every Indians.It is here a severe battle was fought between company force and mutineers and the Residency was blocked by Indian sephoys under the able leadership of Begum Hazrat Mahal for four months.This is termed as first Indian war of independence (1857).Still today, one can see bullet and canon-ball marks on the outer buildings ( Dr. Sayre's House- if I remember correctly) of this garden palace. British Resident of Lucknow -one General Lawrence was shot by a bullet in this war and subsequently  succumbed to injury. After four months of blockade resulting severe rationing and starvation, relief came when Gen. Havelock defeated the Indian force. British rulers took time to erase from their memory the trauma of Lucknow blockade. It is a must see sight.Apart from historical aspect, serene beauty of this garden house and architectural excellence of many buildings within, may appeal  tourists. I could take only two photographs(those I have uploaded), as my battery went down."
292,"Very colonial, lot of history, great to have a guide here",Good architecture and peaceful place. You can se some good sightseeing. Place is just ok not to much to explore.
293,British Residency : Bystander of the past,"At a minimal entry fees of about 5 or 10 rupees for Indian citizen and about 100 for foreigners, its a fantastic place and a great picnic spot. with lush green gardens and a wonderful museum it is a place every one should visit."
294,Journey Down Indian Pre-Independence Days,"The seiege of Lucknow lasted for about 5 months, but how on earth did the fairly small British contingent survive for so long against so many enemy? Following year, the british regained this area, but it didn't last, rightly so!!"
295,Should be renamed as lovers point.,"19 September, 2015 (Saturday).From the cool winds blowing by the Gomti river, we crossed overfrom the Shaheed Smarak (Martyrs Memorial) to an important locationassociated with the the First War of Indian Independence, circa 1857.The British Residency was home to the siege, where a small groundof people led by Henry Lawrence held on. Lawrence died duringthis siege, as did many others. The place has been preservedquite well, with beautifully laid gardens, well-laid maps andinformation signs, which describe the various buildings in thiscomplex, and their functions. Right from the Bailey Gate (theceremonial entrance), to the Doctor's House, the ballroom/diningroom, the place where livestock was kept, the Treasury House,and the main building itself, with its iconic conical small tower:the entire place has been preserved (with one notable exception:more about this, soon) almost as it was,when the British re-captured the city of Lucknow. The one notableexception was one part of the main building, which has now beenconverted to a museum. This is the 1857 Memorial Museum, wherecameras and cell-phones are not allowed. (There is a small kioskoutside, with lockers, for such items to be stowed, by visitors).This small museum chronicles The First War of IndianIndependence, through photographs, models, and effects. The pointwhere a cannon ball entered and mortally hit Ms. Susanna Palmer,is preserved, with a bas relief done beside it, depicting thisincident. This museum is air-conditioned, and has two smallcannons, and three palm trees at its entrance.We roamed all around the place, with its beautifullymanicured lawns, and admired the level of preservation ofhistory, even after all these years. We had visited the place ona hot September afternoon, when in spite of a small breeze fromthe neighbouring Gomti river, it was quite hot. We had a veryquick tour of the place on foot. A more detailed visit would takesomewhat close to two hours or more, we estimated, if one were to visit allthe places in this complex, and go through their history in somelevel of detail. This gem of history is an almost must-visit forIndian history buffs, on a trip to Lucknow."
296,Nice Place,"The Residency, also called as the British Residency and Residency Complex, is a group of several buildings in a common precinct in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. It served as the residence for the British Resident General who was a representative in the court of the Nawab. The Residency is located in the heart of the city, in the vicinity of other monuments like Shaheed Smarak, Tehri Kothi and High Court Building.It was constructed during the rule of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan II, who was the fifth Nawab of the province of Awadh (British spelling Oudh). Construction took place between 1780 and 1800 AD. Between 1 July 1857 and 17 November 1857 the Residency was subject to the Siege of Lucknow, part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The Residency now exists as ruins."
297,History comes alive,"There are number of things to improve like cleanings, trees, benches etc.. no food provided ( canteen ) only picture gallery is nice to visit , out dated systems are there to action but i doesn't work every time. Only a monument which is going to ruin very soon. Because no maintenance for buildings."
298,One of the most magnificent ruins of our Colonial Past,A great heritage site........... ancient architectural buildings with historical significance..... still bearing british legacy...... peaceful place and covering large area of greenery..... reasonable entry fee
299,good for history lovers.,We had a nice couple of hours pottering around the campus.  The thing that amazes me is the sense of history that you can sense and feel here and what comes up about the British time in India.  YMMV
