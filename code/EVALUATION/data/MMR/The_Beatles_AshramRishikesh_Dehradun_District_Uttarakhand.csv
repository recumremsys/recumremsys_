0,Best place to visit,Beatles is best place to visit in Rishikesh.  Fans and lovers occasionally stole in to scrawl their names in the empty buildings.
1,The Inner Light,Must visit if u are in rishikesh you will get to know historical pictures of Beatles still exist in rishikesh
2,great place to visit,"Beatles Ashram was a major attraction for foreigners and it was free. Where they created very nice Graffiti, painting around the Beatles Ashram. Now Indian government took over this place and cashing out :) Entry time to this place is from 9am to 5 pm Entree fee is Rs 600 for foreigners, Indian Rs 150..under 18 it's free so I sent my 7 years old son and he took some pictures inside it. Even though Rs 600 is the entry fee, I have seen a foreign lady entered it paying Just 300 or maybe less (not asking for a ticket). This trick may help you... Welcome to India :)"
3,Travel back in time with The Beatles,I believe beatles ashram is must visit place in rishikesh.oddly satisfying and haunted place to vist.. not really haunted but yeah if u have a imagination you could feel :D
4,A graffiti  lovers paradise,This place is one of the tourist place in Rishikesh which is globally acclaimed after the Beatles visited the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ashram in the year February 1968.
5,Overpriced but good,Its situated in the Rajaji park in RishikeshIt has the memories of beatles when they visited the maharaj ji ashram in 1960’sThey have some preaching done which are well exhibited there in the buildingThey charge you to visit this place so if you are going as student carry your id to have discount.They have some good graffitis I liked few and some are destroyedBut visit once
6,Pleasant quiet space,"Ticket prices are bit too high.. Beatles Ashram is one of the good places to wander, Its little away from the noise of town which is good. I like the nature around however it needed to be maintained and clean."
7,Good,Disappointed that the buildings have been vandalised. Still a magically place especially when some sings Beatles white album as you go round
8,So good I have been twice ,Best place to showcase your photography skills in luxury green atmosphere.Graffiti artwork at the beatles ashram is also one of the famous thing.Now it’s deserted but with lush green ambience in the suburban alleys of Rishikesh will greet you inside.
9,Nature claims the ashram,"A small poster that highlights the major tourist spot of  at Chaurasi Kutiya, more famous as the Beatles Ashram."
10,Beatles ashram ,"Definitely make it a point to visit this part open art gallery, part abandoned buildings, part museum of Beatles stay."
11,Beautiful to stroll around,"It’s a great plan to do in Rishikesh. The place has peaceful vibe and the art is so cool. I listened to the Beatles while walking there, it added more magic to the experience. Don’t forget to bring repellent for mosquitoes and if you are in a group, you can ask for a discount but the price it’s very reasonable for western standards."
12,Really chill place,"If you are in rishikesh u should visit this place, it’s a old ashram were the Beatles stayed and composed a few songs there, it’s a beautiful place with amazings architecture and views, it’s a shame it’s “abandoned” but it’s now kinda of a free art Sanctuary. Worth a visit"
13,Hidden gem of historical place,Very nice place. A must visit if one goes to rishikesh. One can still feel the calmness which this place has . This must have been an amazing ashram when Maharishi was living here
14,Nothing to see ,Interesting photo exhibition and eerie ruins to explore of this former ashram visited by the Beatles and other 60s icons. Also interesting graffiti. It's worth the 600 rupees foreigner entrance fee - we were almost put off by the price but decided to go for it and it was a fascinating place to see.
15,Sham,place was great but 150 rs ticket very high. if you're interested in The Beatles you can visit. in rishikesh we stayed 4 days and visited every place
16,Great historic place,"Thought pricey 600INR worth visiting, as you really feel part of human spiritual history. Ashram is completely abandoned, however serene and beautiful to walk and meditate in meditation little houses. Graffiti works are also great. Not to be missed."
17,My visite to the Beatles Ashram in October 2019.,"This is a quiet and peaceful ashram in Rishikesh, there is a shop for us to get some snacks or drinks. But for foreigners we have to pay some bucks."
18,Meditation,"great place to visit  and best place i visited in Rishikesh, I went with of guide help me to take a lot of pictures and explain the history of this place."
19,"Poster showing attractions at Chaurasi Kutiya, more famous as the Beatles Ashram",It’s a very nice place to visit in Rishikesh. A huge area with lots of beautiful street art all around. They also have a little photo gallery with old photographs of the Beatles in the Ashram. Definitely worth visiting!
20,A MUST!,"I was in Rishikesh for Yoga.  For tourism, the Beatles Yogshala was for me an incredible piece of history. If you have heard of The Beatles, DO NOT MISS THIS!!"
21,Trip with friends,i visit beatles ashrm when i come to ram jhula walking too much so take car. i like it beatles visit for meditation it very good maintained huts are ver nice. I click beautiful photo of this place but entry very costly
22,Just a history,We went for a visit at this ashram for the sunset . Definitely worth visiting it if you are in Rishikesh It had a great  love energy
23,Peaceful and quiet ,If you are visiting Rishikesh and not visiting Beatles Ashram then you must have missed some of the great arts. It's wonderful place to spend some of your quality time.
24,Amazing place ,A must visit place in Rishikesh ... would be a luxurious place or ashram when in its prime ... beautiful graffitis
25,Very nice,"Since the Beatles set foot in Rishikesh in the late 60's , this place has been a tourist attraction for anyone who is interested in Yoga and meditation. Impressed by the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi the Beatles flew down to Rishikesh and stayed at his ashram which is now famously known as the 'Beatles Ashram'. One can take a look at the eye - catching graffiti and paintings done by the visitors on the wall of the abandoned ashram."
26,Needs attention ,"Nice and calm place to relax and have interesting walk for Ashram exploring. However in my opinion, the entrance fee 600 inr is too much because the place is quite abandoned. There are some nice paintings on the walls which you can find inside and outside of the buildings. It was interesting to visit the famous place where the Beatles were to learn transcendental meditation."
27,Not something you must visit but you can go if you have plenty of time,"This Ashram has a museum of pics and info of The Beatles time spent here in the 70’s. Each area of the now dilapidated ashram has a board with info on each area eg Communal dining hall, residence and kitchen."
28,The Beatles Ashram,the ashram is good but entry fee is high. you can spend full day here. not must visit place but if you want to know about  Beatles then visit here.
29,Atmospheric visit,The Beatles visited this Ashram 50 years ago it is great to walk around the abandoned compound trying to imagine what their experience was like. The meditation caves are fascinating and just imagining what it took to get from Delhi to Rishikesh half a century ago is amazing.
30,History Restored,Chaurasikutiya aka Beatlesashram Rishikesh is a spectacular wonder to explore. Beatles came here in 1968 to learn transcendental meditation (TM) from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. During there stay here they wrote many famous songs.Main catch there are meditation huts and graffiti art. Also residence of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.Lush greenery and serene..Now it's under Rajaji National tiger reserve
31,A must visit,"My hubby and I loved our visit to the Ashram. Yes its dilapidated and ruined and nature has reclaimed her ground, but we spent a fascinating and leisurely tour by ourselves here. It was nice to get away from the bustle and traffic of Rishikesh and hear the sounds of nature and bird song for a while. Also loved the graffitti art throughout the various buildings. We could only imagine what a heavenly utopia this place would have been in its heyday. We went when it opened at around 10am and were the first ones there. Please note closing time (4pm?) as its a fair walk from the Rishikesh bridges only to be turned back. This is an awesome place of peace, interesting ruins, broken dreams, artwork and some great photography opps! I sang Beatles tunes all the way through!"
32,Yoga teacher’s training ,The beatles ashram is a very unique place. It is nicely maintained and can be good for a day out. It has a small and good cafe. There are monkeys so people should be careful with their belongings.
33,"A visit to my own personal ""holy"" land...","The Beatles Ashram could be a major tourism  landmark for Rishikesh. The footfall is increasing but the forest department is not the competent agency to develop this unique place. It needs a solid plan,"
34,Dilapidated and uninformative. ,Hugely atmospheric abandoned Ashram and TM centre. The decaying buildings have charm and the artwork is great.For foreigners on a budget be aware of the ridiculous Rs.600 fee. This is shameful; A student card should get you a much lower fee if you have one.Visited middle of the afternoon and lighting for photos was great.
35,A must visit place in Rishikesh,"Very nostalgic, being in a place that the Beatles meditated. There is some beautiful artwork on the old walls of the ashram- paying tribute to the Beatles. Just know that if you plan to walk, its maybe about an hours walk from the Lakshman Jhula - second suspension bridge that crosses the Ganges. There are loads of shops and restaurants to stop in and take a rest or drink some masala tea. But keep walking and asking people for directions"
36,Expensive ruins,"Hi,Been thr n september. Entry fee is 150 for indians and 600 for foreigners. It has lot of good graffitis and paintings. Its an isolated place and gets really dark at night. It closes by 5:30 pm.but its amazing to view the nature and buildings."
37,"Nice place, greeneries and wall paintings","Being a Beatles fan, this place is steeped in history. Must see place for every Beatles fan to understand where they found their inner peace and fulfilment which lead John Lennon & co to make great music inspired by Love, peace and tranquility"
38,Beatles love,"I can visit this place every time whenever I go to Rishikesh. Most amazing place. If you are planning to visit Rishikesh, go once there"
39,Worth going if you are a Beatles fan.,"Tucked in and part of a tiger sanctuary. Must visit especially for those who love art and architecture. Better visited during the day. Takes a few hours to cover the ashram, comfy clothes, shoes, camera and water to be carried. Has a small Cafe but unsure of operating hours and food options. Recommend nature trail walk around."
40,Must visit ,Nice graffiti Good energy But very dirty and unsafe  We seen a big snake 🐍 there They charge 600 rupees for the visit  At least they could clean the place upA little bit better !
41,"Great Art, Beautiful Scenery","Looks like a beautiful ashram however they want to charge foreigners 600 rupees where Indians pay 50-100, so I didn't visit it"
42,Good place to do a photo shoot!,"Maharshi mahesh yogi Ashram, which is famously called Beatles Ashram as they lived here for a while . Built like igloos, many of those small units , dedicated for each of permanent members of ashram, gives a different experience... its in the midst of jungle, offer peaceful and calm atmosphere for meditation.. now ofcourse abandoned .. you see many Westerners who are Beatles fan visiting the Ashram... I don't recall exactly but there is heavy entrance fee as well.."
43,This place call me again and again,"Rishikesh became famous on the Global Travel map almost 50 yrs back, when the Beatles came down here in search of their ""enlightenment""Although not well maintained now, it still ranks as one of the most popular tourist attractions in Rishikesh. Checkout the abstract murals on the Ashram walls. They can still inspire that artist inside you."
44,historical ashram,Mahesh Yogi ashram and Beatles ashram both are same place silent place not well maintained good for art lovers
45,Interesting,Calm & quite place. It's perfectly blended with natural beauty and 84 abandon kuthis. Spirituality in the air. Lots of beautiful murals have painted in the awesome placeTiming: 9:00-5:30
46,Needs a little HELP!,"Originally beatles ashram was known as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram located in a beautiful spot with in Raja Ji National Park with holy river ganges flowing quietly behind it.It got worlds attention when legendary English rock band The Beatles visited this place for Yoga in 1968 but with time everyone forgot that and it was ruin after it an abandoned place. But now Uttrakhand forest department turned it into eco friendly tourism destination most important attraction inside ashram are graffiti.Beautiful graffiti are all over the walls of ashram, peaceful place close to nature and so quite and photogenic some places of it are still ruin but never seen such beauty and the best part is few of  these graffiti were painted illegally on these walls.This place has entry fee of rs.150 for indian and rs. 600 for foreigners now this place is again open for tourists so that you can enjoy serene beauty and history of this place."
47,"Beautiful landscape, very artistic graffiti and cool environment",Recently ARTEX visited this ashram and done an amazing wall art in the main hall of the ashram. Long time back Beatles band was here so it is named after them otherwise it is also called 64 kutia.
48,Old Beatles Ashram,Its worth the walk from town if your there from stunning views and its worth the entrance to muse at these odd hive like abodes which were created in 1960s shortly after the second world war and futuristic from this point of view but the place is lacking in spirit of the people who stayed here.
49,Beatles Ashram ..... Awesome ,"Yeah the Beatles stayed here and composed many songs. But the place is now in ruins as it is part of the Rajaji Tiger resreve......and all the graffitti have been drawn recently. Pretty inaccessible by road, lucky our tires did not get punctured. Except for the so called Meditiation Kutirs there was nothing of real interest.  And to pay such a high tariff for this is not worth it - neither is the time that is lostAnd I really don't know why people say they had Airconditioned Caves. They lived in a building - NOT a cave. God knows if they ever used the Meditation so called Caves/Kutirs which has been built of river rocks. These are at the back gate and you have to walk all the way in.But you do get nice photos with any graffitti"
50,A lost treasure!,"the Ashram is abandoned and its inside the national reserved park. since it attracts lot of people as a tourist place, the entry is allowed. It has lot of graffiti work on the walls of ashrams buildings. it worth of 2-3 hours visit."
51,Beatles Ashram is a must when you're in Rishikesh,"One of the must visit attractions in Rishikesh, you can feel the amazing energy and beauty here !! I visited this place during my yoga teacher training in rishikesh with my friends. Did meditation and enjoyed the silence and peace. Although the cost seems expensive, it is run down so need some attention from local people or government to keep it lively and comfortable for the tourists."
52,100% worth a visit ,"I always wanted to visit the famous ashram where Beatles met with Indian culture and studied under the famed Mahareshi Mahesh Yogi, in the 60’s. While I fulfilled my bucket wish list item, I was saddened by the deteriorating condition of complex built by the “father” of Transcendental Meditation, Mahareshi Mahesh Yogi, in the sixties. Furthermore, the experience was, somewhat, marred by the knowledge of conduct of the Yogi with some of his female students, which caused a rift between him and two of the Beatles and resulted in their departure from the ashram."
53,Cooler than I thought.,"Nice place located near Ram Jhula at walking distance. The small museum and cafe inside the ashram is very nice. Also, the stone meditation caves are amazing"
54,When Ma takes back over,The vibe of the place along with the artwork…simply amazing. Foreigners have to pay 600 rupees but totally worth it.
55,A calm place just few minutes walk from Parmarth Ashram,i visit beatles ashrm when . i like it beatles visit for meditation it very good maintained huts are veyr nice.
56,Definitely worth the hike,"600 to see the ruins of an Ashram that yes - were visited by the beatles - but other than that there’s nothing much too it. Calm and peaceful, sure. Worth 600 rupees? nah"
57,Offbeat location ,"Swarm Ashram now know as the Beatles Ashram, highly recommend if your a fan or not. Amazing to know your walking the same path that the iconic Beatles did."
58,"Basically ruins, but nice graffiti and lots of history ","My favorite place Chaurasi Kutiya known as Betal Ashram in Rishikesh. I have many many memories inside of that, my art, my lyrics, my slogan, my sign, my poems and most of my energy is there.... When I have whole day, I always pass my time her ""n"" feel some different kind of vibrations. As you can feel Maharshi Mahesh Yogi Ji still chanting mantras ""n"" sharing his experience of Transcendental Meditation... I love all the old buildings, 🏢 all cottages, all cave for Sadhana, all hided cave inside throw the concert hall. There are two big ""n"" huge hall there.  Lovely painting of Love, Maa, Monk, Sages, Cow,  Monkey, Shiva and many other alive sign ""n"" arts... ...You will never feel bore.  Such a great place ""n"" palace...Must be go there... Best wishes by... #Raj..."
59,Impressive,lot of walking so elders should avoid or be ready to climb and walk. they have entrance charges for indians 150 rupees. the place is beautiful.. government as it is charging now from guest should make it more interesting with more facilities. amazing place as the way they have construccted leaves u in imagination what it would be in early 60's and 70's.
60,One of the must see place in Rishikesh,If you love Beatles and art then it's a must visit destination. It's very close to the bank of river Ganges and the place is divine. Peace would seek you here and you wouldn't be surprised to have an epiphany about why the legends came down here and how it could have been a transitional experience for them. The graffiti painted across the place is a constant reminder of the experience and vibes the place radiates.
61,AMAZING PLACE!,A walk through Rishikesh will bring you to the Beatles Ashram - so strange to see all of the run down buildings and ruins from the 60's when this was a thriving location. There are murals everywhere and a photo gallery of their time at the Ashram. They wrote most of the White Album here. Worth a look if you are a Beatles fan! PS - our guide took us here - we would never have found it!
62,DO NOT MISS THIS!!!,"Really enjoyed the peace and beauty of this place, fascinating to walk round all the buildings even though they are left to the wild to take over, a leopard was spotted from one of the buildings. Artwork worth seeing, Cafe on site where you can get refreshments and small snacks, we could of spent the whole day there, would highly recommend"
63,Major disappointment,"We visited ashram and the fee for foreigners was 600 Rs. At first it is too extreme for seeing ruins. The second - the place belongs to Forest department but the fee is taken by Gauhri Range office. This is not official entrance fee of the Indian government.  The ticket provided is company's recreipt. When we talked about it, we were bullied by the person who collects the fee. Do not recommend anyone to pay illegal entrance."
64,Abandoned yet beautiful!,An amazing mini city in the middle if forest perfect in construction and amenities. A marvel of 60s and 70s and a must visit place.
65,Worth checking out,"This is just ruins! You'll like it if you like graffiti on walls! Very beautiful graffitis, its a hugeeeee place you'll get tired of all the walking but can be a good place if you're their in winters, but for summers, no!"
66,Half-day adventure,"Big Ashram, 30-min walking from Ram Jula bridge. Very beautiful surround by the big trees. Calm and peaceful. There are lot of place to take a photo. Lots of mosquitoes as well."
67,Mahesh togi ashram and Beatles ashram is same place,Its worth the visit . Expensive to go in compared with other places (around 600 rúpias) but its a most go.
68,Iconic.,"i was there in November 2018 amazing art work all around , good to see the memories of the Beatles when they spend there time in this peaceful place, good for meditation, surrounded with nature and also have a canteen which is nice to refresh after a walk."
69,Rishikesh’s must see 🌻,"Part of history, nice and simple depiction of Mahesh Yogi's once bustling ashram, from where Indian spirituality caught the world's attention and spread through. Once can spend some peaceful time here."
70,# 3 thing to do in Rishikesh,"Amazing atmosphere in this nature bound place. Ashram ruined buildings exhale the mighty, the peace and the radiant moments that shivered the world through inspirational songs. I miss the place."
71,Very nice,Amazing place to visit. Incredible atmosphere and ambiance. Worth to go and visit to see the history
72,Average Visit,"Beautiful, spacious area. Wonderful for those who love to snap photos for social media with art pieces everywhere. But also great for those who just want to get away and chill in solitude. Such a vast area that you rarely bump into other travelers/ tourist. nice rooftops to hang out on, fun rooms and buildings to explore, incredible nature to submerse yourself in. A bit price at 600 INR, but can be an all day excursion."
73,Could have been maintained better,An amazing mix of nature and spirituality.Lots of beautiful paintings(1 mural) were painted in the wall of ashram.  Peaceful place.Simply awesome.
74,My favorite place in Rishikesh,Beatles ashram is such a beautiful place with beautiful art of walls then I can feel walls should say something the view was nice and awsm place was so interesting with many things you can learn about yoga kriya from the infrastructure and the view of ganga was awsm love this place
75,600 Rs lost for nothing real,Slowly decaying buildings with some great graffiti and the history of the jet set and the Beatles make it an interesting stop on your itinerary. They even have a cafe for drinks and a photographic exhibition which was interesting.
76,Beatles rocks,"We were in Rishikesh during the Kanwa Yatra festival. Thousands of people flocked into this city to participate in such a big religious experience. So we decided to escape the chaos and hid away in this abandonded ashram. The ashram was so ruined, but we could imagine its greatness. The roof of small ashram was designed into the shape of mushroom. So cute. You can find a lot of amazing graffiti. In the triangle shaped building, we knew later that we can go up to roof top to take a paranoma view. Yet we didn't go, because it looked so abandoned and afraid someone was expecting us up there... *Mosquito everywhere. Be prepare."
77,Beatles asharam,"if you go to Rishikesh, then you must visit this place.find ashram will help Google map, because the central roads do not lead there.if you are lucky, like me, you can go for free and do not pay 600 rupees(300 uah)this is a huge park area with abandoned buildings, some of them like in the form of an egg.but before, it was a spiritual center for yogis.this place will be interesting for those who like solitude, believes in mysticism,and who knows Beatles, because thanks to them this place was built.now there are a lot of cool graffiti.a place where you can make wonderful photos and videos.and most importantly, a very clean place without specific smells, which is a rarity for india."
78,A magical place,I loved the Ashram! We visited it early in the morning and where nearly the only ones to explore the ruins. A magical Place and photographers will love it! A must-visit in my opinion :)
79,JUST MUST for all Beatles Fans,"A calm n peaceful place to visit, which is now deserted and in ruins. It was built in 1960s and where Beatles stayed in 1968 to compose their beautiful songs. It was the famous center for TM Siddhi for a long time. It was brought in lime light in 2017 when Beatles were reunited by Mr. Lynch. A worth place to visit, i one is in Rishikesh either for leisure or pilgrimage. It has wall paintings and a museum on Beatles stay here."
80,The place keeps you wondering. ,"Its an old abandoned ashram, and is full of dilapidated buildings. Its like you are visiting a haunted movie set, you see old half-broken buildings everywhere, surrounded by large trees. The walls are full of varied graffiti both beautiful and outrageous. Its located in the rajaji national park so you have to LEAVE by 5:30pm, so plan accordingly."
81,An Abandoned Wonder,By the way place is so beautiful .there is 84 (kutiya) for meditation which mahrishi Mahesh yogi used for there meditation.but 200 for Indians and700 for Western is unnecessary expensive.
82,Incredible living relic filled with Art!,Overpriced to get in do did not go. Other people said not worth it. From looking in on yhe outside very run down... such a pity.
83,Must visit,It was a magical experience for me to visit this ashram and I think it’s a must go when in Riahikesh!
84,Unplanned visit to beatles,Here you will see many great painting on the walls of the Ashram. Its worth the nominal enterance fee which they charge for such great art.
85,"Indians 150 Rupees, Foreigners 600 Rupees","Loved to visit this Ashram!! You can really imagine how life there was! I loved the stone huts, the main areas... so green... definetely is worthy a visit."
86,Really cool place but too expensive!,"I loved my visite to the Beatles Ashram in October 2019. The first few seconds I thought that the place could be better entertained for the price we paid. Then, the magic occurred. I was totally absorbed by the specific vibes of the spot. This ashram is a lovely, quiet place, certainly worth to visit when you are in Rishikesh."
87,beatles ashram,All that is left of the Beatles Ashram are ruins. This placed was apparently shut by Govt and reopened for public a few years back. It's a fairly big place and will take around an hour or two to cover. It's has loads of kutirs ( medication chambers) and some ruined structures. There are lot of graffiti work which one can come to check. That apart there is not much to do out here.
88,Beyond Amazing and Creepy,It's great place if u like nature and ruins... The street type graffities are great for selfies as well.. Beautiful location in rajaji tiger reserve.. The entry fee for the park is bit too much.. But great stone buildings
89,A must,"Beatles stayed here at Maharishi Mahesh Ashram some time around '68. There is a small museum which has Beatles photographs from those days. There is a big theatre kind of hall with Beatles murals (probably done by various artists). Otherwise the place is in quite a dilapidated state and only a true Beatles fan will find it very interesting. If you are staying on the other bank, you will have to cross the river over Ram Jhula, turn right and walk till there is almost no road. (20-25 minutes). Then turn left and it gets you to the steep walk to get to the Ashram. Enjoy!!"
90,"Love you yea, yea yea!",What a lovely ashram it is located at an offbeat location . Here one can relax himself and detoxify oneself
91,"Derelict, but still worth visiting...","Beautiful graffiti and huts, an amazing place to click photos. If you are a photographer, you must visit there :)"
92,a good place to take pictures,"600 rupees for foreigners, but the beautiful paintings and interesting buildings are worth the entry cost. Its officially open from 9am-5pm, but you could jump the fence if you wanted to get in earlier/later/for free. Not very busy, but allow plenty of time to walk around and see as much as possible."
93,Shocked,The ambience was great. It’s a must go place if you visit Rishikesh. Excellent hospitality. It’s very popular with foreign tourists. Cafe is very nice.
94,Oh! What's the point?,"This place is away form all the noise of the town.Beautiful, sceni, it has its own different vibe.This place is good for photography.You can see people meditating here, especially foreigners.3 -4 hours to explore the whole place."
95,Great place but overpriced,"Long gone are The Beatles, together with all other people who frequented the Ashram of Maharishi Mehesh Yogi in the 1960s. However, the site is still worth visiting if for no other reason than the peace and solitude it offers for a morning.  Get there when it opens to avoid the crowds..."
96,The Beatles ruins (is what it should be called),At end of d world this ashram is situated They 150 each for entry n foreigners have to shed more Can be skipped
97,Great Place - wonderful relaxing atmosphere,The area is absolutely fantastic. You can reach the temples walking the street on the back of the area. There are 2 entrances. The main entrance is easy to find. The second one is more difficult to find. Keep on walking till you see a path marked with white stones and follow it!The temples are really suggestive. There are several things to see during your promenade. It was a sort a micro village by the river. Closing your eyes you can easily feel how beautiful this place it used to be. Now it is in ruins and it is a goldmine if only it would be restored. Even like this it worth a visit!
98,Nice place to relax,Is good for couples. Me and my soulmate meet first time here. Its very fabulous place. I like the art. It is still on renovation. I love it . for indian citizen its only 150inr so according to mee its excellent place in Rishikesh for couples. No body with disturb you.
99,Brilliant ,imagine beatles meditating in the dark caves here getting enlightened for strawberry fields forever...its a place which closes by 5pm and costs foreigners 600 rupees entry..indians 150 and students 60 rupees
100,Return visit after 10 years,"I visited the Beatles ashram with a friend during my one month stay in Rishikesh. At the moment it is a tourist attraction and it's left to its own destiny and slow destruction by the forces of mother nature.The place is beautiful and peaceful. We found some great pieces of art on the walls most probably done by a local artist. The potential of the ashram is great and I really hope that someone takes it, restores it and makes it function as ashram again as it has really great vibes for this purpose. The territory is big with nice greenery and access to the banks of the holy river Ganges (which is currently not accessible and needs some cleaning and maintenance).The unique architecture of the bungalows made out of the river rocks makes you feel as if you are in one of those adventure movies.The accommodation buildings are big and can accommodate plenty of people. Climb the stairs to the rooftop terrace to enjoy the view and the art on the domes.There are several meditation halls for group practices.It's really sad that the place is turned into ruins. It can be a great location for the International yoga festival.Make sure you have couple of hours to explore the ashram without rushing and may be find a nice quiet spot to sit and meditate."
101,A must see if you’re interested in The Beatles or history of popular culture,"This is a great activity whether you love the Beatles or not. The view of the River Ganges in the sun was stunning and the greenery surrounding the meditation huts was so beautiful. The huts were especially cool to view. HOWEVER, we have left with x1000 mozzy bites each. Completely our fault but make sure you wear bug spray!!!!! We could tell we were getting bitten as we walked around. ALSO, bare spiders everywhere... big ones."
102,Peace,"t’s quite a walk to the ashram, one would get surprised the entry does not mention of Beatles ashram, there they mention Rajaji Tiger Reserve which spans behind the Ashram having around 2 male and three female tigers. The ashram is in ruins, the government has taken up some restoration work under the name of “The Beatles Ashram”, we could see a small café and a photo exhibit of the Beatles stay in the Ashram. The whole ashram was all designed by Maharishi, which houses over around 100 buildings. Its real trip down the memory lane, worth the time spent. The place is quite a huge one can see post office also among the ruins 😊 ….! God is strange in his ways 😊"
103,Little gem,It's good to visit for some time with friends as it is something one might not expect in Rishikesh...
104,Beatles Ashram,"Now this is something you have to visit. It's an abandonded ashram but full of calm and deep energy. Foreigners pay an entrance fee of 600 rupees, and walking around the whole land will take up to 1,5-2 hours. Go in the afternoon when the light is smooth and you can take amazing photos for your Instagram. There's a small cafeteria, but the thing is just to walk around in empty buildings, look at the artwork on the walls and just let Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ashrams energy to sink in. And very near is the tree where Papaji (Mooji's master) used to give satsang when he was in Rishikesh. It is the biggest tree just outside the entrance, ask the staff if you don't find it."
105,A must!,"Big and interesting, especially if you're interested in The BeatlesThe area and building are run down and derelict now. They have been abandoned for decades and there is graffiti everywhere. Some of the buildings are elaborate, with mosaics and meditation chambers, but only the shell of them remains. A big pricey at 600 rupees though for international tourists. There is a possibility of sneaking in area the back area at the very rear of the premises. But don't let the guard in the green uniform see you though as he sometimes asks for tickets."
106,enjoyed,"I went to the beatles ashram in February. The ashram is located on a hill adjacent to Ganga. Make sure to carry your student ID card for a discount on the entry fee. The ashram is abandoned and as you walk through the buildings, you cannot help but admire the beauty of the entire scene. Check out the graffiti in the buildings and auditorium"
107,Loved this!,"Had a chance to work with great artist pan, Rachel and tushar to renovate the art at the beatles for the re opening of this place and to discover hidden secrets of this place through Maharishi Mahesh Yogi grandson."
108,Disappointed with high entrance fee,"If you’ve heard of the Beatles and you’re in Rishikesh you simply must visit this tranquil place where the Beatles came in 1968 to stay as guests of the Maharishi. Recently opened to the public there is a surprising amount to see but it is what happened here, rather than what remains, which is of real significance. Whilst the Beatles were here they wrote at least 35 songs (some writers put it as high as 48) and it was their most prolific period of songwriting ever. Two thirds of the White album and two songs from Abbey Road were written here as was John Lennon’s Jealous Guy, although originally he called the song Child of Nature. It was to be the last time all four Beatles were together outside the UK. Entry is 600 baht."
109,Great if you do it for the 'gram,"It was strange to visit the Beatles' Ashram in Ram Jhula, Rishikesh, for their 50 years arrival in India, in fact Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Ashram of Transcendental Meditation. 600 Indian Rs for foreigners' entry fee, it's a lot for ruins of TM headquarters, but the meditation with International Yoga Festival 2018 Sangha of Parmarth Niketan Ashram brought Love Life Light Laughter to what appears a dead place, except for the artists' paintings and graffitis all over. Great also to have sung John Lennon's 'Imagine' with beloved Bhakti singer Daphne Tse in company of all Yogis & Yoginis present from over 100 countries around Pujya Swami Chidanand Sarasvati ji. Let it be! Aseema Om Tara"
110,A must-see when in Rishikesh,They charge you 600 Rs to visit a place that has strictly no interest  All grafitis are new and this is just another tourist trap
111,Like common down from a sugar rush,"This is a nice place to roam around and stay, for 1-2 hrs. Lots of greeneries and some beautiful wall paintings with which you can take wonderful photos. There is a small food canteen too. It is more of a Park with some dilapidated old buildings, whose rooftop u can reach and have a look around at the hilly surroundings. It is very near from Ram Jhoola area too. So a must visit for sure."
112,Nice perspective on Mahesh Yogi and the TM movement,"If you have a penchant to explore through history, Beatles Ashram is a must visit. While Beatles band travelled all the way to Rishikesh in 1968 to find peace, little did they know that they would leave behind a piece of their musical vibe here. This ashram is now a  part of the Rajaji National Park. Although this place is now in ruins, in 2015 artists took on a project and left behind sacred murals which are breathtaking for any art lover. Best time to visit is in the morning, they open around 9am.From Ram Jhula, it is a 1km walk."
113,Worth a visit,Interesting if you remember the Beatles and their trip to India to study. Read about it before you visit.   The area is poor but the people kind and generous. The Sikh Temples have frequent festivals and we were invited to join in song/dance/music and given meals.  See the student art work on the flood wall along the river downtown Rishikesh.   The Ganges river is cleaner than downstream and used daily by believers.
114,Going back in time,"The Beatles Ashram is beautifully built, but poorly maintained. Although the meditation caves are still standing for the past many years, they are dirty from inside due to neglect and there is trash thrown at several places. It is not worth spending INR 600 on the entry. Although, it is a quiet place with quite some artwork (mostly photographs of the Beatles) and a decent cafe."
115,More than just The Beatles,"The ashram is now the gateway to a lion preserve and little remains of The Beatles visit. Yet it’s cool to sit inside the #9 pod where it’s said Lennon wrote Revolution #9. The dilapidated cement barn is worthy of a visit for Camera action of Beatles and Maharaja graffiti. A must see when in Rishikesh, budget 90 minutes and an easy hike from Laxman Julha. Beware the 600+ rupee admission cost."
116,Money minting for forest department,"I enjoyed my little sojourn of the so-called Beatles Ashram, which is actuallythe Chaurasi Kutiya Ashram. This was the ashram of the controversial Mahesh Yogi. But it came to limelight due to brief but eventful trip by the 4 members of Beatles in 1968. The ashram today is in much dilapidated condition. I think this must have been restored and given a retro looks. There are some 84 meditation pods here so it is called Chaurasi Kutiya. For me Rs. 150 entry fees is not so much but i also think that Rs. 600 entry fees for foreigners is rather steep. What i loved about this ashram is its quite atmosphere that catapults all visitors into sort of meditation. It is also a great place for rejuvenation after facing maddening crowd in Rishikesh. I think high entry fees helps in maintaining the decorum of the place as it is also part of the Rajaji National Park. The view of Ganges from Ashram is amazing. The place is sort of pilgrimage for fans of Beatles while an average person can find much solace and peace here. Highly recommended."
117,A musical fans must,"This place is completely ruined however the ashram's architecture is not to be missed. Located at a distance of about 2 kms from ram jhula, the place is associated with history of Beatles when they came here to practice yoga. The place is not maintained properly but still you will be amazed to see the many rooms where Beatles would have stayed. The main meditation hall is full of graffiti and very lively. Should visit this once at least."
118,Derelict yet Peaceful ,The walk to the ashram and the Rajjaji National Park was excellent. They are charging entry fee Rs.150 so unless you are desperate to go in avoid. The walk to and around the area and the Ganga beach near Gita Bhavan is wonderful quiet.
119,Worth a visit,Visit this place and set aside an entire day for the visit. Keep exploring the prayer halls and the bunglows and find interesting wall paintings.The forest dept charges rs 300 as the entry to the place but this is totally worth the price.
120,History with sadness,Very authentic experience of what the old ashrams looked like when the Beatles came...very eccentric place..dont miss it :)
121,Imagine...,It is worth seeing .Govt. should maintain it . It will attract more tourists .the loans should be maintained and a good canteen or cafeteria should be there .
122,Beatles ashram.,If you will charge 15o rs to go see the place nobody will go there.it could be cheaper than you charging.by the way place was good
123,Really cool ashram ,"The Beatles were here at the peak of their career. This ashram is closed but we tipped some locals to show us in. Some of the rooms were really old and creepy. This is the only ashram I've been to among a cluster of many such ashrams, in Rishikesh."
124,Charming abandoned ashram with great artworks but expensive entry fee,We went there quiet early in the morning and one can surely experience how this place inspired the four beatles.A must see place for a musician and even you can feel the strong essense of blissfulness getting out of the surrounding.
125,Beatles Ashram ,"I walked there and back. It takes about 40min each way from Laxmanjhula Bridge.It is easy to find - I quickly checked on Google Maps before I headed off and had no problem finding it.They open at 10am and I recommend going in the morning because of the heat. The premesis is huge and you can easily spend several hours there exploring everything. All buildings are freely accessible with lots of nice artwork here and there.The entrance fee for foreigners is a bit high, but negotiable 😉"
126,Total waste of time and money,The ashram is huge with lots of story to tell. But it is in a very sorry state due to negligence by the authorities.
127,Its one of the famous sites to be visited in rishikeash...!,The Beatles Ashram is probably a good place for you to visit if you are a Beatle's fan. They charge you entry fees but they don't maintain the property at all. There was no guard there and the bunch of guys who collect the entry fee weren't in uniforms & it felt more like an illegal collection because of their demeanour. The Ashram is nothing great either. The graffiti however is mind blowing and the only really good part of the entire visit.
128,Chronically disappointing,600 rupees entrance fee is overpriced but worth visiting still. Easy to find not sure how you can get lost it’s one straight road. Great graffiti art
129,"A place of peace, interesting ruins, broken dreams and artwork.",This place is totally worth a visit if you're in the Risikesh area. You can imagine the peace and love hippie days with the Maharishi and the Beatles. It's a pity the Indian government doesn't turn this into a hostel - it's a great location on the Ganga and the stone pods would make great rooms. The grafitt art in the meditation hall and on the surrounding buildings is super cool. Fun to walk around all the abandoned buildings.
130,A not to miss attraction in RIshikesh!,"It is Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s Ashram which now lies abandoned. Beatles apparently spent a year here. The new name is probably just to attract foreign tourists. It is part of a natural tiger reserve. The route is not signposted and can be easily missed.Inspite of being unused, it has a unexplainable spiritual energy attached to it. It also shows how advanced Maharishi’s ideas were even in the early 70s. Anyone with a spiritual interest will love this place on a small hillock overseeing the Ganges. Makes you wonder how can you abandon a place of such natural beauty and energy.Give yourself a couple of hours to explore and don’t miss if you are in Rishikesh."
131,Very nice to have been here,"Actually I was doubting to go, after reading the different reviews. Also because they charge tourists 4 times more. But I am happy that I went. Firstly the located is at a beautiful place, a really peaceful area. Secondly it is really huge, much bigger then I had expected before. You can easily spend there hours. Thirdly, there are beautiful paintings. So if you like art then it is a must visit. Fifthly the bad maintenance makes it even more beautiful. The nature is slowly taking over the buildings."
132,Fantastic!,The ashram is abandoned and falling apart completely but the graffiti left by fan groups is just mind blowing.
133,Better than expected!,The energy in the ashram had high vibrations. So much history left behind. The graffiti and paintings were pretty cool. If you go early first thing in morning before guards get there. Won't charge the 600 rupees.
134,Lost,Fantastic place with it's own speciel living spirit...go there and be dazzled <3Go inside the biggest building and take the stares to the rooftop !!!
135,Interesting,"Maharishi Maheshyogi made this masterpiece in the 1960s...it become famous as Beatles Ashram after Beatles visited the Ashram in 1968.It was abandoned for many years till recently the forest department opened it for visitors. A must visit place while in Rishikesh for the architecture, the hundreds of small kutirs which we're meant for meditation in its hey days, the paintings that adnorn the walls.It's a explorer's and a photographer's delight. Go towards the morning times so one can click pictures in good light. It's a long walk around the Ashram so people having problems walking may find it difficult. Otherwise a great place."
136,Make sure you reach before time,"It is not easy to find.. You have to go after Ram Jhula, left and all the way till the end of the street. Then left again.The place is falling apart but as a foreigner you have to pay 600INRInside, you have a small photo exhibition with the beattles and maharishi guru, founder of transcendental meditationThe rest is ruins I the middle of a very big property, go inside each house and you will find surprising graffiti"
137,Ashram,"All hyped up by the fame of the band. What I witnessed was sad degradation and neglect of sturdy structures in a country with so many homeless...... For 600 rupees, no thank you. Only highlight was the photography display of the Beatles visit."
138,Top Site to Visit in Rishikesh,The ashram is run down but amazing to see where the beatles wrote abbey road and the white album. If you are a beatles fan you must visit. I wish I could have seen it in the 60's. Definately worth a visit.
139,Amazing indian,"I'm not a big Beatles fan, but enjoyed my visit to this Ashram. Liked the meditation huts, scenic surroundings."
140,Beatles Ashram trip,"Its too bad that this location isn't listed under its proper name; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram. With that being said is is abandoned. And a bit of a challenge to find. As there are no signs for it... but there are signs for the Tiger Reserve that it is associated with.  I asked the guard if this was the Beatles Ashram and he said ""oh yeah, its that too"". Prices are again different for foreigners and locals, 650 rupees for a foreigner and substantially less for a local tourist. I did read that you can enter through the back gate but, they do have some ticket, spot checkers t/o the complex. As it is abandoned , there is little to no maintenance performed on it but it is very very cool in concept. As there are two signs that i found in English, and only about the Beatles, Wikipedia and Facebook provided some good background to the history of the Ashram.  But, while you are in it - just enjoy, explore, appreciate the art work on the walls- it really is pretty cool! With no expectations on my list, this would be a 'Come back to"" location."
141,Fabulous tour of the Beatles Ashram,"It is nice place and it has these small concrete house where you can meditate. It is in midst of jungle. 40 YEARS ago it was the place for the transcendental meditation and it was lively. Now only ruins are there but wonderful place. Calm and quiet. Our Yogi's inspire beatles, steve jobs and many more."
142,Nice - Worth a visit,"The most important feature of this place in solitary is its consolation. This ashram, which is situated in the lap of nature, connects you with nature."
143,Magical,"So glad we did not miss this while in Rishkesh. It is a very interesting place to visit with great art, and many photo opportunities. It is also very quiet, and tranquil. There's a bit of an uphill walk, so wear your walking shoes when you go."
144,Interesting trivia for Beatles' fans,"I was not expecting something out of this world from this Ashram. We know that Beatles stayed here in the 60s and this place might have given them the inspiration to write some of their hits, but the way this place is maintained is quite poor. This Ashram comprises of Chaurasi Kutiya (84 huts) where ppl used to come and stay here for Meditation - Transcendental Meditation technique which was developed and pioneered by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. This Ashram belongs to Maharishi Yogi and everything here is about him . There are just few walls with Beatles graffiti. - that's it. Absolutely nothing related to Beatles. This place is just branded in the name of Beatles. From entry gate to exit, no where Beatles is mentioned. Visit was disappointing to say the least."
145,Wow!,This is the ashram which the legendary Beatles had visited way back. Now it is closed and no longer in use.
146,Worth seeing!!,"The ashram itself is crumbling away, but it is fun to explore, you could spend hours walking about and finding new and interesting things.If you are a lover of the Beatles you will be blown away, there are lyrics and beatles themed artworks all over the walls around the entire ashram. I was brought to tears by how beautiful this space was, it is awes inspiring and a must while in rishikesh!!"
147,Truly wonderful place!,"OK. So archaeology people are gonna find this place interesting. They will figure out couple of stuffs about structure and all here. For others, it might not be as enjoying as it sounds!This is mainly abandoned ashram. Old structures and peaceful environment. There is like hill-top view there from where you can see Rishikesh city and Ganga river.There is entry fee of 150 INR for Indians and 600 INR for foreigners. I don't see this fees justified as they are not maintaining this ashram up to the mark with fees they take. I am not asking about rebuilding the place. Just cleaning the place perfectly, maintaining daily cleaning and adding more information everywhere. Adding sign boards and guiding tracks and all. There is a lot of things to be done to make this place nice without disturbing its core.e.g. You can't meditate in meditation caves! They are like dark creepy places!.. Any good someone ever done to this place is just large graffiti here and there. They make you feel good there. Big buildings are like scary houses. People even hesitate to enter them & they don't what which passage is safe. Guiding tracks would help them here."
148,Unique place in Rishikesh ,"Charing more than 600 from foreigners and almost nothing from indians is no fair and terrible for the things you can see. It's kind of racist, they should threat all tourist the same!!!!"
149,5 reasons to visit the Beatles ashram ,"I have been to Rishikesh a number of times, but it never had a chance to visit the Beatles Ashram. It is a bit expensive visit, but in the right mindset you will have an amazing time here. The graffiti paintings are pretty amazing and ruins has its own beauty."
150,Great vibe,"Hauntingly beautiful abandoned ashram  - go for the architecture and quiet natural setting.	Way beyond my expectations.  Don’t miss this, even if you are not a Beatles fan.  The abandoned buildings are hauntingly beautiful.  They are now part of the nature preserve.  There were no hawkers, peddlers, trash or beeping scooters.  The peace and quiet was fantastic."
151,Dirty ,"The erstwhile Beatles Ashram by the holy Ganga in Rishkesh lies in ruins and is now a Tiger Reserve, but enough remains of the original sprawling campus to excite fans of the hugely popular pop group of the '60s and '70s. The picture gallery and vestiges of buildings give clear evidence of the daily life of it's large community of dwellers.  Definitely worth a visit, if for nothing else then the serene location and stunning views of Rishikesh and the holy river Ganga."
152,Is it worth 600rp?,"Better and bigger than expected! And although abandoned, you can enjoy a nice stroll through time and picture it how once was. There are also nice views of Rishikesh from up there."
153,What a sham,"Left derelict by the State government but still a piece of cultural history, worth a visit to see where the Beatles lived with the Maharishi"
154,Interesting spot worth the venturing,It was quite far from where we was staying (@ the Laxman Jhula Bridge). It's best to hire a ride to get you there because you'll be walking around seeing the buildings/area.  The location and religious vibe helped shape the Beatles mind and help their creative juices. Make sure you make it further back in the compound to see the 4 or 5 story building that housed many who stayed there during the Beatles time. There are quite a few and humorous graffiti on most if no all the walls of the building. Definitely one of the most enjoyable places we visited while in Rishikesh.
155,Over priced however worth a visit ,A mysterious place is this ashram where now nature returns on all sides.The meditation pods are silent for the meditator.
156,A Walk Through art & history ,We went to this ashram in April 2019. It's a wonderful place - ruins and nature intertwined. You have to be reasonably fit as it's built on a slope/hill. Some great artwork too. Would like to mention the cafe. We had a fantastic cup of masala chai there. The man running it was very kind and forgiving of us loud and giggling tourists!.
157,A feeling of belonging,"The place is very nice and despite being abandoned you can really feel the energy that led the Beatles to compose so many great songs. It offer great places for pictures with Graffiti in the background and and a nice photo gallery.Tough the visit is worth it, be aware that is overpriced, costing 600 rupees (about $8) for tourists. Just as a comparison sightseeing places in India charge less than that. Seems a bit to much for a place that does have to much maintenance cost."
158,An interesting trip back in time,"About 45mins walk from LaxmanJhula Bridge is the former ashram of Maharishi Mahesh yogi (founder of Transcendental Meditation “TM” movement). This is where the Beatles famously stayed in the late 60s and wrote a lot of material. Despite its previous place in the limelight the ashram is now a series of ruins and crumbling buildings but it’s still fascinating to wander round, imagine the once buzzing community and admire the well placed graffiti. A must see in Rishikesh, even with the steep 600rs foreigner entrance fee!"
159,Fun journey,"This is a beautiful Ashram located at the top of a hill. It took some time to find it because off the main road there is no clear sign pointing you to the place. It has steep entry charges of Rs. 150 for Indians and Rs. 600 for foreigners. They have strict checking for tickets and fines, so it is advisable to buy tickets from the entry itself.The Ashram was a place where the band members of the Beatles meditated. The stone cave made for them has some artwork inside. Parts of the Ashram have been decorated by graffiti artists from all over the world. It is stunning.The only thing missing is information about the life back then. It is difficult to go back and figure out how life must have been and indeed, how the Ashram functioned at that time, but if that is done and presented, then this place has enormous potential. There are cows and monkeys roaming wild in the premises, and generally, the place has a derelict feel. It really makes you wonder how it must have been all those years back when it was an Ashram. A very very interesting place to visit."
160,A place to re discover one!! ,This is worth an afternoon. From the construction of these meditation caves to the views of the ganges to the photography museum you can imagine why the beatles would fall in love with this special place.
161,Its a joke in the name of Beatles ,Osm please ... We went the beatles ashram and strolling there we felt quite good there. mind gets peace and there mahadev ji's shivaling
162,Step back in the time of the beatle.,"India is one of the most Colourful country ,rich in history, culture, foods and art and more..... not only incredible, amazing, magical. If you have enough patience to see you will find te Jewels in this part of world. Namaste."
163,Serenity lingers on at this paradise,"It's more or less a MUST to visit this Ashram when you either grew up with the Beatles or if you're really interested about their songs especially written during their time in Rishikesh. It's a pity that nobody cares about this special location, to see the dilapidation of all buildings. Take your time walking around, enjoy the fantastic nature , the great view and of course the chance of putting your foot into Ganga Ganga Mata"
164,A creepy and offbeat location,"We went here because one of our daughter is an artist. The location is amazing with sweeping views of the Rishikesh and Ganges. The whole campus is really well designed. The graffities on the ashram walls are just out-of-world. The architecture of stone caves or huts were surreal!We had a black dog, who acted as our guide. We paid in kind with few slices of breads. He showed us all important locations. It was truly wonderful."
165,The place,"I did not actually go inside. I took pictures from outside. The walk to the Ashram is very nice, as is the little garden outside. Very peaceful, and I can imagine The Beatles and Donovan writing their music there. Needs to be better maintained"
166, Nostalgic ,"Chaurasi Kutiya (84) - famous for many reasons, one being for Meditation. Some years back, people used to come and stay in these kutiyas to Meditate. Another reason which drew attention to this place was that when the world famous band called ""Beatles"" came to India, they were so inspired by this place that they decide to run it for some time. Now this place is taken care of by the Government. This place had hundreds of Small Doom styled two-story structure, where many people came and practised Meditation, though this place was now in ruins, still it had its own Old World charm."
167,The Beatles Ashram,Amazing place to go and chill. Enjoy the sound of the river gushing along on the side. Gives you time to reflect on your thoughts
168,love it,"A lil broken down but it is the ashram in it's rawest form. Art everywhere, exploring the ruins is exciting. Do keep in mind tickets are 600rs for foreigners."
169,A very unique place,"It’s pricey to enter, but it is a beautiful walk around the ashram ruins.If you love the Beatles it’s fun to imagine them there."
170,Wonderful Place in the early hours of the day,"The site is much bigger than I thought.  The Ashram is in a beautiful area and it was neat to tour the buildings and see the old, overgrown mix of buildings with new age, graffiti style murals. Definitely worth the trip, even if you aren't into transcendental meditation or particularly into the Beatles (which I am not).  I easily spent two hours there and could have done more if we didn't have a plane to catch.  I thought it had a calm atmosphere in which to stroll around, sit and think, read a book and take it slow in general after the initial buzz of excitement from exploring."
171,Great place to visit!!!!!!!,"It was over priced because the ashram itself is located within a tiger reserve. We enjoyed walking around and photographing the grafitti, but it wasn't really worth the price or the walk out there."
172,600rupee to time travel,"Didn't like it much, seems to be over hyped, wears deserted look. May be famous because of visit of beatles else there is nothing much to view,"
173,Place of peace ,"As a huge Beatles fan this was one of the pilgrimage sites that I wanted to visit. What a let down! There was nothing to indicate that the Beatles were here apart from some graffiti painted on recently. All the area is run down with little or no maintenance, so be careful where you step!So not only was this a let down but they charged an exorbitant fee (600 rupees), which is the cost of the entrance to the Taj Mahal!!! I feel that paying any money for this ""attraction"" is truly disgraceful. Better things to do in Rishikesh with your time and hard earned money!"
174,A Travel In Time,"Pay 600 rp just to see the abandoned ruins, it's ridiculous. There is nothing to see except the graffiti. I'm very disappointed"
175,Not a Beatles fan but still loved it,"Don't be put off by the relatively high price of admission (by Indian Standards). First time we walked all the way here and then left because we didn't want to pay the seemingly high entrance fee.  There is so much to see, so much incredible art, places to meditate as well as there is always people on the outdoor stage area making some incredible Beatles related music.  We spent hours there both times we went, and next time I go to Rishikesh, I will go again.  It is walkable and an enjoyable walk, we walked all the way from Tapovan, but give yourself plenty of time,  Try to be there an hour or two before sunset and watch the light navigate it's way thru the buildings and the graffiti art, Simply amazing."
176,Check out the Amazing Murals!!,"A bit run down unfortunately, but a nice 45 min walk from Rishikesh, well worth it to spend one afternoon here."
177,meditation place abandoned,"I am so happy I visited before I had to run for my flight! These ruins reveal a glimpse from yesteryear where this site used to host spiritual retreats. Take your time and venture in out of the buildings to discover spectacular murals. This would be an amazing place to shoot a music video. Also, don't fuss about the 600R cost for foreigners. This costs half the price of seeing a movie or 2 cups of coffee yet means so much more. Relative pennies in comparison to my flight there. I will gladly contribute some revenue to keep this place maintained. Plus, if you have an ounce of appreciation for the Beatles, this place will move you."
178,"Great for Beatles Fans, and for quiet seekers",Though beautiful ruins are the words that can be used to describe the other place. But it needed a little better maintenance. And using Beatles name for the commercial purpose also seems inappropriate.
179,NOT WORTH IT- crazy expensive! ,"I’m not sure what I was expecting but the totalstate of disrepair wasn’t it! Makes you wonder where the foreigners 600 rupiah entrance fee goes - if this place had been maintained it would be amazing, as it is, it’s crumbling down and falling apart and artists and taggers have left their marks on available wall space. Which is as Beatles’ as it gets. Would have been an awesome ashram if only it had been maintained!"
180,Epic,"Amazing place, beautiful scenery and incredible graffiti. I wasn't expecting a lot but it was very interesting and we had gorgeous photos. Close to Rajaji National Park - go on safari to see the elephants early in the morning."
181,Different,"Not quite whats everyone expects. The place is run down and unkept. Spend about 30 minutes visiting the place. Give it a miss, you would not miss much!"
182,The Best,One of the best place to visit out from the din and dust. It was definitely a transcendental meditation Centre in the past. But even now I feel this is the only best place which I found calm and peaceful. A must visit place to rejuvenate your body mind and soul and energize you.
183,"Very different,excellent","This ashram was 15 minute walk from the Ashram I was staying at and definitely worth the time to visit. If you like the Beatles, graffiti and  desire a quiet break from the city this is your place. Many photo ops! It's too bad it wasn't preserved as an ashram. those hobbit huts would be fun to stay in and meditate on the roof. There were also plenty of places to do asana practice. We slipped one in on the roof of the old hotel."
184,Good trip,"Where the Beatles once stayed to meditate and instead wrote some of their greatest music, this decrepit place would be so cool to have renovated and perhaps as a place to stay.Alas it is now home to cool art and graffiti, and little else."
185,Young kids would luv this place,I took my first meditation training about 40 years back at this The Beatles Ashram  also known as Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Ashram. At this time this place requires lot of attention. This could be converted to the world's center for meditation. If some one is interested in teaming up with resources please contact me Lalit Jain ( in Canada)   at jainL@shaw.ca
186,fun place,"Used to be an abandoned ashram that anyone could enter and explore or meditate if you wanted, but not anymore. Pay about 10 dollars for admission."
187,Peaceful ashram,Best Wall paintings with beautiful quotes I have ever seen. Try not going solo because taking selfies really suck.
188,Very awesome place,"It w as amazing to see where the Beatles wrote many of the songs from the White Album, but it was distressing that the buildings were in such bad shape."
189,Back in time,"This place is off the beaten track, and we were taken there by our wonderful driver.  The ashram is run down as you would expect but is a fantastic place to explore.A lovely photo exhibition gives a feel of the place in the 60's.  Many photo opportunities and worth a walk all the way to the top for the view of the Ganges and Rishikesh - stunning.  Amazing as an archelogical site - wonder if they will ever restore into a working Ashram - it would be completely worth it.  Beautiful artwork throughout."
190,Skippable,"only the art loves will love the place, But the silence of the place will make you love the place and the graffiti"
191,Adventure trip,We spent a couple of hours wandering around the Beatles ashram and loved it. The tour set up is fairly unstructured - you pay to get in then get left to it. Be sure to keep wandering - there are about 5-6 distinct segments you will want to see and each one more interesting than the last so be sure you don’t miss anything. I’m not a huge Beatles fan so didn’t know what I would think but you don’t need to be to be totally enthralled by this amazing place. There isn’t a place to buy drinks or snacks so take water if you plan to do a 2-3 hour look around and especially if you want in. We had a driver and got dropped at the entrance. Heaps of fun - really interesting - definitely recommend.
192,Amazing place to visit,"If you are a Beatles fan or interested in unusual buildings then definitely come and visit. There is some great graffiti art to see and the view from the top of the largest building is well worth the stair climb. It is a little bit off the beaten track, a little pricey for foreigners to visit and there are no amenities but I found the place to be quite magical. It is a real shame that the jungle is taking over because it would have been an amazing place to stay."
193,Fun activity worth the entrance fee,"It costs 600 rupees, quite expensive in comparison to other things in the area. It's an abandoned place. Expect mosquitos, big plants, mug, falling buildings and even bats. BUT DON'T MAKE THIS FRIGHTEN YOU TO GO. The 84 meditation chambers made with little ganga stones and the halls worth the visit. You can get inside the meditation chambers and stay there for a few minutes.Dont forget to bugspray yourself before going.IMPORTANT: There are 2 ways to get there: 1. Go in the direction of Parmarth Niketan from Ram Jhula, pass Parmarth and keep going. In a certain moment, you'll pass the Last Chance Guesthouse (funny name), after that, in the end of the road, turn left. Walk for more 50m and you'll see the entrance in your right.2. If you follow Google Maps, you'll get an road into the forest. Be sure to turn right when you see one (or two together) RED and GREEN sign. It should be in your left after 70m.Have a nice day!!"
194,Chaurasy Kutian (84 Hutments): A Maharishi's Ashram of Its Time,"Worth the entrance fee to wander around the many buildings and huts in the complex.  The impressive street art adds to the unique atmosphere.  We spent about 2 hours there - it was quite eerie at times walking into the larger accomodation buildings - dark hallways and empty rooms left untouched for years.  The museum itself was interesting, as well as the meditation huts near the entrance. Give yourself plenty of time here, and pack some insect repellent."
195,"600 Entry Fee for Foreigners, Rs 150 For Indians!",If you have ever been touched by the magic of a Beatles song you must make this pilgrimage trip to the ashram where they spent a couple of months - which led to the creation of one of their best- The White Album!
196,worth the long walk from Rishikesh,I have been a frequent traveller to rishikesh from last few years but this was the first time that I visited this place and found this place quite unique and this adds another flavor to the beauty of rishkesh..the artwork done by the artists are at par.
197,Don't go there,"On my recent trip to India, I was very fortunate enough to visit here. It's truly amazing with some exquisite artwork/graffiti and amazing derelict buildings. Definitely worth a visit if you're into street-art, the Beatles or abandoned buildings."
198,Surreal experience,"It’s a very nice experience to visit Beatles ashram .It’s a good insight into the layout of meditation halls, rooms and such used by the TM organization.I would highly recommend it ."
199,A walk through a famous past,"We visited after trying to locate the Ashram several times. We actually went to the entrance to the 'Tiger Reserve' twice, before returning to enter the Ashram.Entrace fee was 600 rupees, which when comparing to other attractions (Red Fort . Agra Fort = 500, Taj Mahal = 1,000) feels pretty expensive.The ashram itself is very peaceful and there are a lot of cool murals and graffiti - we stayed no longer than 1 hour."
200,Cool to See,"Total calm. I just saw 5 people during the two hours I spent there. You can walk around and discover chambers. Also you can be in touch with nature. If you go during monsoon, carry a mosquito repellent. They will follow you everywhere!"
201,A delightful journey through art and history,"In the hectic environment of my first visit to India ... with constant horns blowing, people and building everywhere... this was a wonderful oasis of calm!  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that I would have loved it more had it been a working ashram... where I could have stayed and practiced yoga, meditation and the simple living that it promoted in the 1960’s. Visually also the wall paintings were dramatic and lots of great photos for Instagram feeds etc!! Well worth a visit, but just a shame it is not longer a working ashram!!"
202,peaceful history,"When one visites the place you get a feel of how well functioning and properous and grand the place must have been. Although it is in a rundown and derelict state now, it has its own stories to tell. Surrounded by the Shivaliks on three sides and with the Ganges on the fourth, the views are amazing."
203,It’s an odd place but ok,The title says it allIt’s not a great intro to the place when you’re charged 4 times more than locals simply based on where you were born. ITS RACIST
204,I wish this place goes back to its original purpose,"This Ashram is clearly a gem. Even though it’s clearly overgrown and claimed by the forest, the vibe is very peaceful. For Beatles lovers, a little museum and the graffiti is a great way to capture the vibe of those times"
205,I finally decided to explore this ashram!!,Duo of yoga calling you once again in Beatles Ashram. ... The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi ashram is located in a beautiful spot within the Rajaji National Park with the river GangaRishikesh in northern India to attend an advanced Transcendental Meditation (TM) training course at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
206,Highly over priced but still kind of cool.,"If you're looking for a respite from the crowd and to find the remains of what Beatles once had and shared , this place is a must visit. The Grafitti on the walls speaks of the times they've had And there is so much peace all around. Look closely and in one of the meditation caves you're likely to find some vagabond painting his/her heart out onto these walls that once stood witness to the art of spirituality and Beatles.No you not find any fancy building ...it's a ruins of ashram ...the charges for foreigners for entry is 600 and for Indians it's 150 Indian rupees.This place has its own feel ,vibe and beauty. If you love Beatles you will relate to this place. Seen lots of foreigners meditating in caves. There is a photo museum and cafe in a building near ashram"
207,"Lovely, cultural & spiritual place",It is a very calming atmosphere and a quiet getaway. I loved the nature around it and the abandoned places.
208,Beatles Ashram was amazing,"If you appreciate art & history you'll be in awe of this place. Completely self-guided; you can wander around dilapidated buildings and explore meditation caves and mural art everywhere for as long as you'd like.It's more expensive for foreigners (~$8 USD) but I think worth it. It's a cool half-day activity if you're in Rishikesh for a month or longer but not to choose over a more authentic experience of Indian culture. Not in short walking distance of anywhere so I recommend renting a scooter. Sunset is a nice time to go because less crowds, cooler weather, and beautiful view of the Ganga"
209,Worth a visit ,This is my second visit and after the rains this time was lush and green. A lot of it is in ruins but still so beautiful. They have had street art painted in some of the building last which is sensational. We had a Beatles sing a long on the auditorium very cool. Definitely worth a visit while in Rishikesh
210,Rip Off for Foreigners,600inr to enter a ruin pretty much. Not sure where that money goes as it is all overgrown and abandoned. This does give it a more spiritual feel to it I guess though and is worth a walk round. It isn't signposted but not hard to find if you follow the road it's right at the end.
211,A must ,"This may once have been an ashram and the in-place to do yoga (1960's), but now it is mainly of interest for those who are in to Beatles memorabilia and  nostalgia. The beehive shaped huts that used to offer accommodation to visitors are now mostly ramshackled, but they are still aplenty and offer photo opportunities for those on the Beatles trail."
212,Great visit beware - Rs.600 for Foreigner,Heard lot from local people . As i was on business trip so couldnt spend much time . Its purely foriegners hub . Nice cafe
213,Abandoned but amazing Aashram,"If you’re a Beatles fan or a music fan or a normal human being looking for a day out, don’t bother! I personally feel insulted by the total disregard to this park considering what the Beatles and Maharishi Mahesh has done for the tourism in Rishikesh and India. Firstly; getting fleeced for 600 rupees for a foreign tourist for a landmark that has been made famous by foreign tourists that involves artwork done by foreign tourists - JOKE. I understand foreign should pay more (well I don’t but such is life) but that’s an extreme amount and even the locals having to pay 150 I find slightly extortionate too. I feel scammed to be honest.Secondly; the whole place is in dyer condition, not well kept at all. Maybe they’re going for the abandoned theme which contradicts itself. There’s limited professional graffiti around and a lot of rouge graffiti, some interesting and some complete dribble - yet it keeps the place interesting for you to find an intriguing piece, which I imagine gets painted over anyway, so everyone takes the exactly the same pictures of the professional graffiti as you’re left with little choice. It’s extremely frustrating too see as the area has so much potential with a rich history and well documented throughout its popular years, it could be so much more. However what I can only presume is laziness and the ever flow of tourist income stops it become something greater. All buildings are dilapidated, with the majority not even worth popping your head in, nature has claimed its land back and thats a highlight as it’s Some what relaxing to breath fresh air and hear birds chirp.  Thirdly; for a avid music fan being the only reason I went, I learnt nothing at all about the Beatles and their stay at rishikesh. Not a sausage, no information on how they lived or how long they was there for, there’s literally zero information on their stay. Just lacklustre paragraph on a sign on some buildings. There’s probably tours that go here for a more inflated price, however I saw none inside the premises. I had to google why the park has been left to ruin and the other history of the place, so don’t expect to be educated here on that side of things. Maharishi mahesh has a room dedicated to him with information about him, but I came here because of the BeatlesThe saving grace is the photo room, and even that is average of 20 odd photos, with a random added room of wildlife photography from rajaja National Park, I’m guessing whoever is in charge realise how naff it is here. But If you do end up going, save that till the end otherwise you will be very disappointed. I’ve included a photo of Mick jagger pictured when he spent his time here, his face perfectly imitating my expression while walking around."
214,Fun,"My wife and her friend really wanted to go so we went, but it’s crazy coz for foreigners it’s 600Rupees and for Indians native or foreign born it’s 150 rs!!! Ok I grew up in India so I saved money for my wife and her friend no biggie, but how can you justify charging 7-8$ US for ruins?! The propert was abandoned for the past 15 years, and is basically jungle. My wife liked it and so did her friend and maybe many more, but the graffiti was done 3 years back lol. I think whoever is in charge needs to restore atleast parts of the place and make it more appealing before charging 7-8$ US from foreign clients."
215,training course also,"To be frank, there is not much left to the ashram, only collapsed structures. Artists had graffiti over most of these fallen structures.Those who like to walk through abandoned spaces and photographers who like to click structures will love this place.There is fee of 150Rs for Indians and 600Rs for Non-Indians. I think this place will not interest elders as there is nothing 'religious' about his place."
216,Beatle purists must see ....,"It’s not the most amazing place in the world. In the context of India it’s a lot to go in, 600 rupees. It is fairly interesting to see, I wish it would be restored as I’m sure it was the most amazing ashram at its pinnacle. It’s on the Ganga, lots of cool little stone bungalows, meditation pods and more (completely in disrepair now).There’s is a small photography exhibition that explains its heritage, and former use. Plus it’s connection to the west...The Beatles etc.Also there is some street art. I was looking forward to seeing this but I was disappointed, possibly I’ve been spoiled by living in East London. If you have a lot of time in Rishikesh and you don’t mind spending a little money and you’re into the Beatles go have a look."
217,Fun piece of pop culture ,"I loved this place. It is beautiful, very photogenic, we took plenty of nice pictures. There is a special feeling when you are there, it feels peaceful. You will also see a nice view of Rishikesh. There is a park full of monkeys just next to it. They are friendly if you bring some food for them."
218,Must Visit PLace,"I had lots of hope of this place but it is actually a place in ruins. There is nothing to be seen, except for broken down ruins where Beatles group used to stay. The entry fee is very high Rs 150 but what you get in return is almost nothing."
219,Beatles Inspiration Mahrishi Mahesh Yogi,"Not worth going - there is nothing to see.The admission used to be zero, then 100Rs, then 500 Rs.You can also go in from the side - there is no fence.But bascially the entire thing is not worth the effort unless for sentimental reasons if you know it from its haydays as Ashram."
220,Its worth a visit if your in Rishikesh already but its in poor delapidated state,"I was here about 7 years ago when the place was not open to the public yet. They have improved a lot since. But there is much to review and some were impressive and some were not. So I will break down what I observed. This year is a special tribute for their 50 years.Location is isolated, quite a walk. They have a proposed bridge to get from here to there but that has been started almost a decade ago and progress has not happened. So don't hope too much. Admission is (IMO) fairly steep for the entertainment that you will see. Take your time to climb up, it goes uphill though not very long. The walkway has been improved. The fences on the perimeters are being sealed so elephants are blocked from entering. I also heard that they have spotted tigers here. Inside the compound, there is much to see, for one, the collection of photographs of the beatles during their stay. The ""igloo"" like ashrams where they stayed which is really the highlight of the attractions to see. Two things that really repulsed me. Their TM classes, I heard will really gouge your pocket book. It was like 20K rupees for 3 hours session for four days. That is hard to chew for me. But they do have people doing it. That is almost like the total cost of a 500 hours yoga training. The second is their cafe. We were not prepared when we came, did not bring food and did not eat prior. My friend ordered a sandwich. She said two people. They handed her this sandwich, two pieces of bread, edges trimmed, cut in triangle, packed with mayonnaise and cost was unprecedented. If you have a big appetite, you will need at least 5X that. So we ordered separately. Again, I feel the price was too much for the amount of food you are getting.Moving all that aside, there is nice history to learn."
221,Very interesting ,"We thought about going by, taking it easy.. Have a walk, taking few pics.. Not really a big Beatles fan but let’s go and see! And then a huge sign on the entrance: FOREING FEE : 600 Rupee!! Are they insane?! I mean, almost same fee than TAJ MAHAL! 😂 Just-NOT WOTH IT."
222,I have mixed feelings about everything,"Pretty cool place! There isn't a ton to see, most of it is run-down buildings and photos of the Beatles. There is a mural of them and art dedicated to them. Bring headphones and listen to the white album while walking around and you get a little feel of what it was like for them while they wrote the album."
223,Fascinating history,"Nice place to get away from the bustle and noise of Rishikesh, but it’s comparatively expensive (600 rupees for foreigners) and there isn’t really much to see apart from a bunch of decaying buildings. The good news is that it’s owned by the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, so some of the entrance fee goes to support the Reserve"
224,Awesome place,"I didn't know what to expect but because I am a great Beatles fan I had to visit. From the outside it doesnt look like much but it is definitely worth the entrance fee. The ruins, the art, the history that runs trough this place.. its amazing. Take a couple of hours, and just roam freely and discover the whole place. Lots of small secrets to be found.c"
225,Calm place for exploring,I guess I was too late to visit this place. The entry fees seems high and there is not much to do. But if the weather is good you might go here for a walk or to read a book. The ashram is in a dilipidated situation and has been ruined by the grafiti.
226,Illegal entrance fee,"The Beetles Ashram today is an abandoned structure at the extreme end of the Swarg Ashram area - about a kilometer's easy walk from Parmarth Niketan or Vanaprasth Ashram. Other than the fact that you are walking around the place where the Beetle came for solace - to participate in advanced Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in February 1968,[riddled with it's own controversies] this place has only the Murals - Artxpan - that blew my mind. The murals really add a contemporary meditative quality and context to this hall - without being literal or historic. Done with amazing skill, loved the choice of size, scale, colour and placement of the art pieces that I'm sure will be appreciated by one and all whether or not you are familiar with The Beetles' work! Kudos to the mural artist and the forces that are allowing such interpretations to take place in our art and cultural scene. Worth a visit just for this! Carry your earphones and own Beetles' music while you walk around. We sang aloud to the lyrics [on a wall] of 'Jai Guru Deva'. Carry water too though you will find piping hot Maggi, basic snacks and water & shakes at a small canteen [not to be confused with the Beetle/Delmar cafe - that is near the Laxman Jhoola]. There is also a washroom."
227,Cool place to explore,"We were visiting this Ashram 12 people, so we got a group discount and were paying only for 10 people. Thanks to our local Indian guide who made a deal with a security guy. But I must say 600 rupees is worth the price for the entrance. We spent inside around 3 hours, but I recommend to spend all the day and have a picnic there. Take food and a blanket to sit on - there is no cafe or bar inside. It is really good vibes inside the teritory of the Ashram. Perfec for meditation, long walking and finding all of these beautiful graffities."
228,Super cool ,"Definitely a stop for serious Beatles fans.  Although the surrounding area is a bit rundown, you may enjoy the artwork and interesting building structures.  Climb to the top of the largest structure for the best overviews.  Foreigner pricing is a bit higher than locals, but, you probably will only be here once ... go for it.  After your visit you can sing one of your favorite Beatles songs on the way out.  Hope this helps with your first visit."
229,A magical place,"We walked here from our hotel and shopped along the way. It is 600inr to enter, which i think is being used to restore this place to its former glory. It is much bigger than i thought. I was hoping for more Beatles graffiti art, but it looks like most had been removed. The ashrams made out of stone are worth seeing. Super cool. I can see how the Beatles would have wanted to escape to this place. Lots of monkeys outside the enterance. Don't feed them! They will stay a proper distance."
230,Beautiful and Serene Ashram,"What an amazing place - it must have been an oasis of nature, calm and spirituality when it was functioning in the 60s. The ashram is very big. For The Beatles fans, it will be a treat to visit, with all the art to commemorate them. Go and have a nice few hours walk and try to feel the vibes of the Liverpool lads :) I loved it."
231,Good view,"This place is definitely not touristy. I had to find the ticketing counter on my own to enter the Ashram. Go early enough and find yourself ALONE in this big space. I don't deny that it felt really eerie at first - esp if you're like me and would walk into the dark spaces and structures on your own. I would say it's really safe though. And climb up to the wall-less structure to the top for an amazing feeling top-down. The question is not ""why?"" but ""why not?""."
232,Worth it if you love the Beatles!,"After driving for more than one hour on barrage road from Haridwar, I reached this Aashram... They have entry fee of 150 for indian adult, Rs 600 for foreigners Rs 75 for seniors . I was with my American friend. For once l thought I made mistake by coming to this place...I went towards banks of Ganges, thought for a while and than entered ruins of this ashram... My walk around looking at meditation caves, graffiti and other ruins took me to past ... Nice experience... Can visit if you like Beatles"
233,Interesting visit in Rishikesh,"This place is the land that time forgot... but fans remember and revere.  The symbol of 1960's East meets West, this is a monument to the enlightenment of pop music fans, made all the more poignant  ( and creepy) by the jungle's slow overtaking of it.  Not well marked or advertised, I recommend a taxi directly to the entrance.  Locals will tell you it's just up the road a bit further, but it is way, way up the road, with only a sign for the ""tiger sanctuary"" as your guidepost that you've found it at last.  But once you're there...what a payoff! The perfect accent to your realization that the spiritual city of Rishikesh has become an amusement park, you'll find The Ashram would be a great place to spend Halloween night, roaming the moldering ruins and abandoned hotel rooms, only to come upon looming and gorgeous psychedelic murals and those crazy meditation domes, some of which still have toilets (non-functional) on the bottom floors.  Sit lotus-style of the floor of your favorite dome and play some George Harrison on your iPhone...you'll be transported.  Totally worth the trip!"
234,Let it be,"What a wonderful way to spend several hours in this beautiful, deserted Ashram. The art work that adorns many of the walls is astounding, and seems to be growing every year, and it's quite mesmerising to see Mother Nature reclaiming her position."
235,Pop cultural history,First of all this is Maharshi Mahesh Yogi Ji's Ashram and stop  alling it Beatles Ashram. The band stayed here for just 3 weeks! Well.. I am in a shock why is this place not preserved. You feel the energy and the subtleness of the place. The magic of an enlightened soul who created this place but unfortunately nothing is preseved under this forest undertaken land. Those into spirituality should must visit.
236,Beautiful spot on the bank of Ganga,The location where the white albumWas composed and where the world was introduced to transcendental meditation. It’s been abandoned for a long time but definitely worth the visit. Eclectic architecture and a newly opened museum with pictures of the Beatles visit and an interesting display on TM. it’s a short walk from town.
237,Beatles Ashram Rishikesh ,They shut at 4 PM. And are very strict about entry post that. Make sure you reach early to gain access.
238,A must for Beatles fans,"Could definitely give this a skip if you are short for time. We paid 600 rupees to enter and so kind of expected a bit more. It was a peaceful place to walk around - but got eaten by mozzies and there really wasn’t much to see. Would be more interesting if there was an interactive area to learn more about TM, what happened to the the ashram etc."
239,Taking foreign tourists very often.,"The place is a group of abandoned buildings decorated with nice artworks. There is a small exhibition, like 3 rooms with pictures of the ashram’s past. There is a cafe right next to it. We liked the place as it had really good vibes and it was real nice to spend a few hours in quite which is rare in Rishikesh. We enjoyed the view from the top and did some yoga and meditation there. I would recommend the place if you are prepared to pay the 600 rupe entry fee, which seems very high compared to something like the Taj Mahal where the entry fee is 1100."
240,Artistic Paradise,"As a fan of abandoned places & the Beatles, this place honestly surpassed my expectations. It’s a lot bigger than I expected & some of the graffiti is stunning! It’s a pretty fascinating place that should be on your list of things to see in Rishikesh. The only downside was the extortionate entrance fee for foreigners! 600 rupees is too much to walk around some ruins unless you’re a massive Beatles fan. Go early, bring snacks & spend the day there. Get your moneys worth 😉"
241,It was OKAY...,"The ruins of the Maharishi ashram, where The Beatles stayed for a few weeks, is a pilgrimage site for fans. It is about 2 km from Ram Jhula following a dusty path. At times along the walk you wonder whether it exists at all. Now part of the Rajaji National Park, the ashram consists of old, dilapidated buildings that must have housed the Maharishi and his disciples from all over the world. The place is only attractive because of the pop art made on some of its walls reflecting the era gone by. The entry tickets to the place is Rs 150 for Indians, Rs 600 for foreigners - I have always wondered why our government bodies treat foreigners as a means of milking. While claiming to be tourist friendly, it in fact fleeces tourists at all tourists spots. The Rajaji National Park thus shows a mentality shared by touts and guides across the country and hardly conducive to encourage tourism. The irony is stark because the ruins are worth seeing only because of the murals made by foreigners! And since this is a place of ruins, why charge an entry ticket at all?There is a ghost of a building that was the hostel, a shed where meditation was probably practised, some pods that are actually double-storied, and 84 dark cottages where something must have been done. The buildings are in ruins, with the fittings removed and roofs falling apart. There are paintings adorning the walls made in 2015, I think, that reflect the spirit of the 60s.A range of emotions fills one. First is the sadness at the cost that time takes on even the most well run movements. Then one feels kind of useless to be running after material things, as all will ultimately be reduced to dust. I mean, such huge property, patronised by some of most well known celebrities, now reduced to broken walls - who could have thought at the zenith of the ashram, that one day it would remain just a spectacle?The Beatles spent a productive period in this ashram, writing some songs of Abbey Road here. Some of their pictures at the ashram are available on the Internet. So it is a moment of great bliss for the Beatles fan just to be standing there. One can only visualise how full of life the place must have been at one time.The place can be developed into a retreat of some sort, but it is in ruins at the moment."
242,Amazing place ...amazing potential.,"Its very over priced and there is really not much to see. Ita a bunch of abandoned buildings, some with good art and others, not so much. It cost 600 rupees and the only good thing about that was they told us the money goes to the tiger reserve. Personally I would not recommend this place and you're not missing out by not going."
243,A place not worth visiting,"This is a magical place with so much potential.  It is run down and no longer an active ashram, but you could see so how this would have been the place to meditate and get inspiration.  I loved roaming the grounds and standing in the meditation hive of the Beatles.  Entry fees go from cheap for Indian senior citizens, to Indian citizens to the most expensive for foreigners.  Worth a visit even so."
244,"Absolutely beautiful space, ruins and art",We enjoyed walking around the Ashram for about an hour or so  It is an interesting experience  seeing the abandoned buildings and the new paintings.  A girl from Australia was doing a painting while we were there.  It is a nice park where you can wander around without crowds.
245,Ruined but graffiti is amazing ,It's a little pricey (600r) but ultimately worth it to see where the Beatles wrote a lot of the songs from the White Album.
246,"Cool, slightly expensive, a little hard to find",I visited here as part of a trip with back2nature holiday. It’s certainly worth the time to pay a visit here. Quite an eerie place full of ghosts of a time that once was. I’d recommend going with the services of a guide as there are wild animals at large in the surrounding jungle area. Indeed there were reports whilst I was there of a German man trying to avoid the entrance payment by slipping into the site from the rear. He was trampled to death by a wild elephant apparently. Also if there is no guard on the gate don’t be tempted to proceed without entrance payment.  Security guards patrol the site and there is zero tolerance for those found without a ticket. An extremely hefty fine or a night in jail is the penalty. My guide Shubam from back2nature holidays in picture. He’s wonderful.
247,crazy admission fees for westerners,I've been to the Beatles ashram 3 times already and am going to go back again.  It's a photographer's paradise and the energy feels so good here.  I recommend going early in the day as it's a bit out of town and you'll want to stay all day!  So worth the 600 rupee admission fee!
248,The ruins of the Maharishi ashram are a pilgrimage for Beatles fans,"We were fortunate to have Raja Richard, a devotee of Maharishi mahesh yogi give us a personal tour of this fascinating Ashram. Richard is working with the government to help restore this amazing and historic Ashram, the first Ashram in what is now the Ashram and spiritual capital of India. I definitely recommend visiting the Ashram and if possible having a tour with a knowledgeable person."
249,Abode of peace,"It’s basically a huge nature reserve with over 100 small stone huts and a few main buildings that are now derelict. Spiritual and quiet place, you can spend time walking around and seeing beautiful art that locals or tourists have made."
250,in the footsteps of the Beatles,"I've been to this place 4 times and will go back a few more...  so much history, artistry, beauty, and amazingly peaceful!"
251,So peaceful,"I have get to the door many tiimes for the simple fact that it is located in a nice area, but I had no idea that, by going uphill, I would see the real ashram!! It is so beautiful.... even been abandoned and unexplored. It brings imagination to one´s head by the simple fact of knowing the Beatles have been there!! The meditation chambers are amazing!! The architecture and constructionis of this ashram is surprising. It is pretty much worthwhile to pay 600 Rupees (fee for foreigners) and visit. It is a visit to a recent past that is still alive in our imagination."
252,Awesome place with lot of graffiti work..,"Found by chance , beetles retreat, neglected , but still worth a walk around . Takes about an hour , cost 600 r . Not much information about he place , which is a shame . The photos are good . But only been done later . Been there , which is a possative, but wouldn't go back . Only coz I'm a beetles fan ."
253,My Yoga Journey ,"The paintings and sayings are beautiful, but the place itself doesn't have upkeep or restoration, so paying $600 rupees to get in is a bit of a rip off but the experience makes it worth it."
254,My memories,"The way that the authorities capitalize on this ancient spiritual site appears very disrespectful to its original creator. Reopened only recently to earn profit from the influx of Westerners, and imposing a ridiculously high entrance fee only for foreigners, this fact totaly put us off exploring these mystic, ""bee hive"" - like structures, close to the jungle. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi wouldnt be happy with the commercial metamorphosis of his sanctuary, rather known as ""The Beatles Ashram"". Very disappointing."
255,One of the best touristy things I’ve ever done ,"Abandoned places and buildings have a special magic, but it's sad to see the ashram in such poor conditions. It is worth a visit, though, if you're in Rishikesh. Take some time to appreciate the graffiti as well!"
256,Really interesting compound - great architecture and grafitti,"Being a Transcendental Meditation practitioner, visiting the Ashram gave me a source of belonging, all the time I was vising I couldn't believe that I was really there. The energy in the place is amazing, the meditation caves are so beautiful.  I wished I had the chance back then to be with ""Maharshi Mahesh Yogi"" in the Ashram, imagine how lucky I would have been."
257,Fab place to visit for the fan of the Fab 4,"Before you go here you need to know that this place is an abandoned ashram. It doesn't have any meditation classes and most paths/structures are deteriorating. There is also a steep climb before entering. That being said, it was a beautiful and calming place with a peaceful aura. You can walk into the abandoned domes and can even (carefully) go to the roof. At the start there is a trail which leads off to a point where you can see the Ganga. When walking the main trail, there are many abandoned structures filled with intricate and thought-provoking graffitis."
258,Ruins with Art,"This place is just amazing! It is beautiful--and there is a lot of graffiti  style artwork painted there, which actually adds to the wonder of being there. So happy I went!"
259,For the Beatles fan or as a lovely outdoor walk,"I was frankly disappointed.  There is not a single building that is not crumbling beyond repair.  There is only 1 mural painted on the wall and thats the tribute to the Fab Four.  No pictures, artwork or anything.  For INR150/- I expected a lot more. For Non Indians it is INR 600/-Getting there is difficult and there are only walking trails."
260,good place to visit,"Amazing place to visit. Definitely recommend it. Great scenery, fantastic artwork and views. You will certainly enjoy yourself."
261,A Day in the Life.,"If you can get past the exorbitant entrance fee to the park it is worth it. The abandoned ashram is eerily beautiful and knowing who walked the grounds in search of transcendence makes it feel powerful. Bring a good camera and read up on your Beatles history before coming to get the most out of the experience. You can also walk from main Rishikesh, it is a leisurely 40minute walk down a treelined market clad road full of chai stands and street food delights."
262,"Without visiting Beatles, Rishikesh tour is incomplete","Highly recommend a visit here! Worth a few hours. Bring a journal, something to sit on, and maybe your mala beads if that's your thing!"
263,Ruins of an erstwhile Asram,If you are a Beatles fan this is a must visit and if you are not it is a must visit.  I had no idea how much this place influenced their music.  Have a guide take you who knows the history..if not go to the museum part first
264,Hauntingly beautiful abandoned ashram  - go for the architecture and quiet natural setting.,"I was here just last year. In the past, the government actually closed this place to the public because it is part of the Rajaji National Park. But people want to see it and they bribe the guards. Now, they smart up and the opened to the public. They also built concrete fences around so the animals will not join the tourists. There is much to see inside with some modern addition of paintings of the Beatles."
265,For true Beatles fans only,"I loved my sweet cup of ginger lemon honey tea, my staple drink in the hills, served with a smile at the restaurant. The setting is idyllic and inspires one to soak in the natural calm and peace. Order anything, as long as you get a chance to me the cuddly tomcat. Vegetarian fare, like everywhere else in Rishikesh. Delightful!"
266,Simply Fab!,"This could be so much better!  As a child of the 60s this was a must do for me and my husband.  For many years this ashram has been left to total destruction.  If someone would only put a little effort into this complex.  They charge way too much by Indian standards and offer very little...run down buildings that are a little dangerous to walk around in but the most amazing murals I’ve ever seen.  The location of this ashram is fantastic and with a lot of work and money it could be brought back to life.  One with nature!  HELP, I need somebody!"
267,Beatles ashram ,This is just an amazing place.  I visited it two times to take it all in.  The photo op is beyond fantastic if you are into photo taking.  The fact that the buildings and area are left untouched for the most part is just wonderful for walking and exploring.  Lots of history if you were around in the 70s.
268,Ehhhhh too late,So disappointed in what i saw and the cost to go in ..... theres no upkeep.... graffiti everywhere... hope they fix and restore the once beautiful Beatles ashram...
269,It became a zoo now,This was a big tick on my bucket list. so beautiful and you could feel the energy of the place. Such a shame it has been abandoned though.
270,Good Vibes & Graffiti inside the Ashram,Off the beaten track now and more of an archeological sure but still very special and worth the visit
271,Underwhelming,"It costs foreigners a little more than admission, but it's quiet and a good place to take a walk. It's bigger than I thought."
272,Beatles ashram,"If you're in the area and have some free time this is a very cool place to just wander around and explore. It must have been quite the place in its day when it was actually a functioning ashram. Now it's just abandoned buildings, with a very cool vibe"
273,A must see treasure...,"we made it there just before 5 pm closing time.. walk in as far as you can, because the art work in deep inside among the abandoned structures.. try enter one of those meditation cells theyre interesting from inside too.."
274,Worth entry price.,"The good ol' Beatles Ashram is an old, run down derelict building that hasn't received much attention or l care for decades.As the Beatles went there many years ago, the government jumped on the business opportunity to charge people 600rp to walk through the ruins.A little work has been done in the last 12 months to offer a cafe and small museum of photographs of the Beatles during their time there. A great addition as previously there was nothing.Random graffiti artists have gone in to add their pieces of tags and 'artwork' as well. Worth the trip if you have spare time. Not a highlight compared to other attractions in Rishikesh though."
275,"Located in the holy ""Valley","Frankly, I expected more from this place compared to what it was. There are ruins of what was once an aashram. Some of the graffitti was good. But not worth the entry ticket they charge! Plus, visit the place when you have a company. Going alone might not be the best idea. Not a place that you would regret not visiting."
276,Must Visit place in Rishikesh,"If you are a solo traveler, you see many things from yourself.  Who you may not have seen before........"
277,"If you are a Beatles fan, this is a must go.",So much to see and the feeling of magic arises from the abandonment of the site. It almost feels like you are the first one to discover it. Beautiful artwork adorns the walls in the most unlikely places. Almost feels like a gift waiting to be unwrapped slowly.
278,good but over priced,"I had no idea this was here. I enjoyed my trip.There is tons of artwork all over the place. If you want to see all of it, leave a lot of time."
279,Beatles Ashram,Couldn’t find how to get in. Very poorly signposted. I think the gate is on the riverside. It’s not where google maps will send you for Beatles Ashram.
280,See where the Beatles Meditated & Wrote Dear Prudence,"The structures are not quite maintained, but that’s what I liked. It’s old and charming. There are some beautiful graffiti for pictures and really nice to walk around. I’m a huge Beatles fan so it was nice to see where they got the inspiration for some of their hits."
281,Good place to visit if u like beatles,"I love it here. To see the way that Mother Nature, Bhumi Mata, is reclaiming this land is beautiful. And it's still super charged from all of one of it's past lives as a major TM ashram. The graffiti artists who pay homage to that legacy in their art are so talented. Really cool place. A challenge if you have mobility concerns as it's hilly and uneven ground."
282,Beautiful!,The Ashram is waste of Money ...Not maintained at all...no drinking water at all and charge is Rs 150/-... exorbitant high.. waste of money..
283,Very cool ,"Nice place to visit if a little rundown, in need of a little more tender care but really nice to see the artwork and the beehive huts, gave way to imagine the beatles composing their songs in the gardens."
284,"Music Fans, Artists and Yogi alike may find inspiration here.","We were told to skip this attraction because it was a bit expensive. It was reasonable though and worth it. There is something really special about seeing the meditation caves and all if the deserted buildings. Please, go check this out! It’s a unique experience, the views are amazing and the sound of the Ganga in many spots is incredible!!!"
285,Best Place for Meditation,"Located in the holy ""Valley of the Saints"", the International Academy of Meditation, also called the Chaurasi Kutia ashram,"
286,Overpriced ticket.,Not a massive amount to see and the buildings themselves were pretty run down and unkept. It was a nice place to visit and was very pretty in the sun with some great views but 600 rupees is a bit steep for what it is
287,Peaceful,A step back in time to a different but deeply enlightening way of life. So glad that this beautiful area is being looked after and revived so as we can now see what it was like in the past.
288,Beatles Ashram,"Went there late afternoon before they closed for the day. Great experience. There were almost no one on the territory of ashram and we got to see everything and take photos without any disturbance. It is not well kept, but interesting from a historic point of view. If you happen to be in rishikesh, I suggest you pay this place a visit."
289,Oldest Ashram,"Shabby, no maintenance at all. Such a beautiful location, but what a waste. I have no clue why people visit"
290,"Abandoned and not taken care of, but worth a trip",I am absolutely shocked seeing this amazing property being completely abandoned. It has got  such a fantastic location how can it be left in this condition?? Not a single official reference bro the Beatles (it very much looks to me like there is some legal issue behind the scene...as if you go to the Beatles museum in Liverpool you can sense that Rishikesh was an important milestone in their life but you don't sense anything here...)Even if there wasn't any link with the Beatles how can this place be left in this condition..shame on the owner of the ashram....600 rupis is a joke.
291,Magical Overgrown Ashram,Be open and willing to see the things that are there as you walk through the experience.  We  were wowed by some of the facilities and then came upon 40 Italians singing Yellow Submarine and other Beatles greats.
292,Artist's Paradise,"If like me, you are very intuitive to energy around you, then i ded suggest spending a late afternoon at the.ashram.A lil.bit pricey to get in as a foreigner, inr 600, but the place is filled with awesomeness for all tastes.For photographers, it is a delight,  as well.for.those instagrammers... with all the graffitti/artwork...Roaming through the abandonned ruins feels magical... for something extra, I'd suggest late afternoon, when the sun starts setting... there's both an eerie and incredibly powerful energy going through the place...Magical..."
293,Well Hyped place - Dont why they charge so much,"We went as part of a group tour and I was not that interested in going but it turned out to be a really great day, it is really interesting and definitely worth a visit we spent a couple of hours there singing Beatles songs in the big hall."
294,Expensive,"I will admit that I am a HUGE Beatles fan- so take that into account. I could not wait to stand inside hut number 9, and search for all of the wonderful art pieces. 2 hours flew by on my first visit - so I went back a second time. I loved taking my time to wonder through all of the crumbling buildings. This place must have been amazing when it first opened. Its a lovely, quiet place to enjoy the outdoors. Don't be put off trying to get there- as the paved road literally ends, and the signage to get there is minimal at best! But I found it- and although everyone is complaining that it costs more as a tourist to get in 600 INR = $11.81 Canadian. I found it worth every penny."
295,Not worth the drive.,"Having been abondoned since 1984, this place has become overgrown though remains in reasonable condition. It appears that it belongs to the Rajaji National Park now, and they are doing a certain amount of maintenance. I only hope they won't spoil the amazing ambiance of this unique site."
296,Pure Magic...,A bit out of the way but well worth a visit but sad to see the way it has been allowed to become dilapidated.
297,Wonderful graffiti,"Location of this place is not well marked. Directions in google gives the right turn where turn is not available. Wherr the actual right turn is there is no marking. Actual  right turn is at place where there is big board of Rajaji National park. When you reach the place you dont even find the board of Beatles Ashram. Entry fee is 150 rupees for Indian and 600 rupees for foreigners. This is a loot, I dont understand why they have put entry charges so high.  Not even a person was available on Gate."
298,Primarily for the Beatles Fan...,"This must've been absolutely beautiful when it was opened and in use. Now although abandoned, you can still appreciate it and enjoy a nice walk through the retreat center. It was better and bigger than expected. Definitely a must! It has an area with great views of Ganga River and Rishikesh."
299,Great place to visit,"For the millions of people around the world who are practicing Maharishi's Transcendental Meditation technique, and for all Beatles fans, this is the real thing! Built on leased government land in the 1960's, the forestry department has finally shown some interest in the abandoned site. Maharishi left in the 70's and the forest reclaimed the property. Now the place is being reborn as: The Beatles Ashram. Lovely setting above the Ganga, the buildings are under repair, the property is fenced and protected, and it's being fixed up. There is already a nice Beatles photo exhibit in one of the repaired buildings. There is an entrance fee (600 Rs) for foreigners (75 Rs for Indians) but it's worth it. Over 100 buildings, all designed by Maharishi A real trip down memory lane for so many. Take some time to explore the place. Across The Universe."
