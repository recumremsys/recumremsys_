0,a nice retreat in the city,"If there is a place that can make you forget you’re in a huge bustling city like Tokyo, walking towards this shrine is the place!You start walking into an area that is nicely wooden and gives you the impression that you are walking through some wilderness towards the shrine. The shrine itself was nice and is definitely worth a stop if you have some time in Tokyo. It’s a nice escape from the busy-ness of this cool city."
1,Solo adventure,An oasis in the middle of Tokyo. You almost forget you are in the middle of the most densely populated city in the world.To get the most of your experience try to visit it before going to Kyoto. Because after visiting Kyoto ...
2,"We walked past the Shrine, but the Walk was nice, empty Sake Barrels n All",Worth a bit of time when you’re in Tokyo. It’s a lovely area that makes you feel like you’re not in the heart of a city. Would absolutely recommend.
3,Serene and remarkable,"A lovely place to visit, really magnificent. Easy to get to when you have understood the subway system (easy!). Fairly busy, but has a one way system, so not too bad."
4,Tranquility abounds,In the middle of a huge city like a Tokyo this garden and shrine is a wonderful escape. A must visit.
5,A Forest within a city....Tokyo's answer to Central Park,This temple and grounds are so well done.  This area is so calm you forget you are in the middle of Tokyo.
6,Highly recommend place,You can’t come to Tokyo and not see the Meiji shrine. It is a shrine set in a lovely green expanse. Often there are weddings and you might be able to catch a procession. I loved the wall of wishes where visitors from all over the have pinned up their wishes. A truly beautiful place to visit in Tokyo.
7,Beautiful shrine and park,"I actually like the place.  You basically walk into the forest like park in the middle of the city.  The walk to the temple was wide and an easy walk. You don’t hear the traffic, so you can actually enjoy the peace.   There’s a sake wall to the walk to the shrine, great for pictures.  The shrine when was not that big but it’s ok, it’s not so crowded with tourist."
8,A walk through a beautiful park,A really lovely space. A few minutes in you would never know you were in Tokyo! Really recommend spending some time here.
9,Beautiful area to stroll around in the centre of Tokyo,"If there's one temple in Tokyo that you absolutely should not skip or miss, it is Meiji Jingu Temple. It can get pretty crowded so make sure to visit early in the morning."
10,"Tranquil, spiritual visit","A must see when in Tokyo, this haven in the midst of the busy city is serene and quiet. One doesn’t need to spend a whole lot of time there, but shouldn’t be given a miss."
11,Peaceful,"You absolutely must go to a Shinto Shrine, and a Buddhist Temple while in Tokyo, there is one probably within a few stops from you. Beautiful."
12,Shrine Visit Highlight,Can’t recommend this temple enough. You instantly forgot that you’re in the middle of a busy city. Great introduction to temple etiquette with easy to follow guides in the brochure. Recommend the inner garden for the extra 500 yen. Be sure to gain a charm to change your fortunes!
13,Praceful and traditional shrine in the heart of Tokyo city Centre,This has to be on everyone's must-see list to feel they have visited traditional Japan. It is in a beautiful wooded park. There are a number of graphic displays describing the shrine and it's history. There is also a shop and very well kept restrooms.
14,An oasis of green in the midle of concrete,"This sanctuary gives you the opportunity to go back in time, incredible walks in what appears to be a park that, like a curtain, opens to expose historical buildings.I recommend you visit with a guide so you can discover all the secrets of the Meiji Shrine.If you have a chance there are ceremonies for visitors where you will have the opportunity to live this experience in your own flesh.After the walk, you can visit the surrounding area, the shopping area is very worthwhile"
15,Beautiful oasis in a bustling city,This place is really magic. You will feel the real japanese culture here!Surrounded by nature is a must see stop on your trip to Tokyo.Stop by and buy also some of the amulets and make a pray for your dearest one.We loved the experience!
16,Beautiful shrine and surrounding park,Really nice place for a stroll around the park and to check out the shrine. Y500 gets you into a nice garden with koi fish and a natural spring. We were too early in the year for the flowers but I’m sure it’s amazing in springtime
17,Must visit and conveniently located,Right in the middle of the hustle and bustle you’ll find this little oasis. It was a stinking hot day and the shrine was the perfect escape. Would recommend to all visitors.
18,A must visit Shrine,I usually go to Meiji Jingu for quiet walks whenever I am in Tokyo. It's a  good place to reflect and participate in their traditions and customs. Also good to research about doing ritual cleanse before visiting
19,One of the best Shrines,"If you've seen lots of temples this one will feel average. Beautiful grounds in and around the temple, but if you're heading to Kyoto, the temples there will feel more impressive."
20,Beautiful ,"We found the city of Tokyo to be an even moving hustle of people and business, especially after the fun and madness of Shibuya crossing.    Walking through the massive Tori Gate into Yoyogi park surrounding the shrine was a gentle slide into a green calm.   Tourists thinned out as we got closer to the temple and we passed small side gardens, now closed, that we wish we'd be around earlier to explore them.    A second enormous Tori gate announces your arrival to the Meiji Shrine and you are entered into the grounds of the shrine itself.   We saw a lot of shrines over this trip and you get a little ""shrined out"" however the majesty of Meiji remained with us and cemented itself as our favorite.   We performed the ritual washing of the hands (some wash their mouth out as well) as an act of respect before proceeding into the shrine proper.   One inside, it opens itself to you and shows the grandeur of it's size.   Stop on the edge and wait for a few minutes, take it all in, feel the timber that surrounds you and see the construction while the sweet smell of cedar wood and incense.    A spiritual moment?   Maybe...    but for me, I really enjoy traditional timber construction and craftsmanship, along with the tactile sensations you get from them.    What can I say, it's my bag!   From there, move into the main courtyard and up to the actual shrine and burial place of Empower Meiji, the 122nd Emperor of Japan and the man who modernized the nation. I feel the shrine really is a cultural must-see for Tokyo visitors.   There are information boards all around describing the emperor and his rule.   The shrine itself is a beautiful thing to behold and like us, you will want to buy one or the prayer boards (500 yen), write a prayer on it and place it on the hanger for the priests to present and offer the next day.   You can also purchase any number of small charms for whatever luck you want.   This is a fun think and it gives you some unique souvenirs.   They may be a little pricey but if funds go to the upkeep and maintenance, I’m cool with that.   Toilets abound through the park and pathways and there is a large cafe/restraint complex with souvenir shop.   Good shop for traditional quality items over tacky fun ones.Getting there is easy, either by walking up from Shibuya like we did or getting off at Harjuku, right on the park entrance.  Come early or late as it appears the park gets busy in the main part of the day.   If you are in Tokyo for some cultural satisfaction, this really is a must."
21,Gorgeous gardens. Peaceful,It sits next to the busy area of Shibuya but takes you away from the hustle bustle. Perfect getaway from the city craziness and is a lot cooler during summer days.
22,Amazing Shrine,"You miss this cultural icon - so easy to wander around, and so much to take it. Definitely an easy way to spend a lazy saunter."
23,Stunning,"Big, beautiful shrine in the middle of a thick forest, in the heart of a busy city! Quite a long walk from the entrance to the shrine but it was worth it because we get to walk underneath big, green trees that provided fresh air.. Unfortunately the main shrine was under renovation at the time in preparation for the Centennial celebration of Meiji Jingu Shrine in 2020."
24,Traditional ,"This is a place where modern Japan gets to celebrate its birth and dedicate a lovely part of it's Capital City to the Emperor Meiji. I was fortunate enough to visit in the Centenary year 2020 as the grounds were developed in 1920 when it was a desolate area. Many signs in English showcased the history and I was also fortunate enough to visit during the Covid19 outbreak as crowds were very small. Easy access by both train and subway lines, i thought it was well worth the visit."
25,Major and popular shrine,"This was my favourite place in Tokyo city. Super close to the metro station. A beautiful walk, so peaceful and tranquil. The shire was lovely, a few places to pray or write a wish/hope down. The vibe was calm and just beautiful."
26,Such a calm place,"If you can't walk a lot, there is a fair walk to get to the shrine.  It's very nice and worth a visit."
27,Peaceful,"A must-see shrine surrounded by a beautiful park in the middle of the city. If you're lucky, you'll catch a wedding ceremony on the weekend."
28,Shrine and young children,"Visit this majestic Srine surrounded by hundreds year old woods in the middle of Tokyo.  Listen to the trees, the wind and the crows, you would never think you are in a city with 15 million people."
29,Lovely place,Depends on whether this is the first shrine you have seen in Japan (therefore great) or the 100th (therefore OK) but as there isn't a huge amount of traditional japanese culture to see in Japan it is worth the visit.
30,Beautiful ,It’s really peaceful to walk through the giant Torii gates through the greenery here. It always helps me clear my head if I feel overwhelmed by the city.
31,Public restrooms at the shrine ,A corner of great peace and serenity in a modern and fast metropolis. The Meiji shrine It is mainly a beautiful Oasy of peace and tranquility especially during the days of the week when it is not crowded with tourists.  A beautiful forest surrounds the sanctuary erected in honor of the emperor of the Meiji dynasty. Definitely recommended a visit at least for a breath of fresh air and to take a break from the speed of Tokyo
32,Beautiful Shrine near Harajuku in Yoyogi Park,"Don’t miss Meiji Jingu, the most famous shrine in Tokyo. Plan on walking quite a bit in good shoes on flat ground. Lots of cafes and restaurants nearby for lunch. Gift shop has fun souvenirs."
33,A very zen escape from the city,This place was very worth a visit. It was very tranquil and peaceful amongst the chaos of Tokyo. Cafe and gift shop of site as well as toilets.
34,temple walk,"peaceful quiet place. I love walking, but for most people who don't want to stay outside for a very long time in summer, it's definitely not the best place to visit, especially in the afternoon."
35,Was the highlight of our trip!,"Starts perfectly with a walk through the park to reach the shrine where you can see the absolutely enormous gates and trees. You could say the park is an attraction in of itself. The shrine is quite the spectacle to behold and exudes a wonderful atmosphere (just hope it isn't too crowded of course!). Like in most shrines, you are able to purchase charms for varying purposes that also serve as first-rate souvenirs."
36,Nice walk away from the hustle and bustle,"Well Meiji Jingu is one of the most popular shrines that Tokyo has, it's very easy to find and to get there!You can see the beautiful architecture of the Shrine, the nature involving it, and if you can just go further inside into the hidden roads there to get a pleasant surprise!Ah the omamori, Japanese talismans, are very nice looking! You can get one for almost every thing.It's a nice place to be with your family, friends or significant other."
37,Enjoyable temple walk ,Begin with  a beautifulWalk through a park and find your self cleansing before saying and clapping at he gorgeous shrine. A must in Tokyo.
38,Worth seeing!,Walking through the Torii gate at the entrance to the park removes you from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo.  There is quite a long walk to the shrine itself but it is through a forest of greenery.  It makes your visit much more enjoyable than Senso-ji which is too crowded to enjoy (in my opinion).  There is a lovely smaller garden called the Inner Garden that is also quite beautiful.  An admission is charged for that part of the garden but not the main shrine area.We ate a light lunch at the cafe by the entrance.  It was a great place with delicious food and fun people watching.Would definitely recommend this oasis in the middle of Tokyo.
39,Peaceful Oasis,"A must see when in Tokyo, it's free, a couple of shops and restaurants along the route.And lots of places to take nice pictures."
40,Magnificent. Even in heavy rain,"Overview:Shinto shrine in Tokyo.Pros:Surrounded by Amazing garden/rain forest.Plenty to see and learn.Peaceful If you arrive early before 9am, you’ll have it almost all to yourself. So much history. Cons: None. Summary, Must visit if in Tokyo"
41,Meiji Jingu Shrine- janpanese spirit,"As other travellers have mentioned this park is a tranquil haven in the city and yes the temple may not be the most stunning buildings compared to others in Osaka and Kyoto but the setting in the park make it special. We also were lucky enough to visit when a wedding procession were leaving the temple to be photographed in the gardens and they looked stunning in their traditional clothing especially the bride in a magnificent kimono. Within the park is the imperial garden with a pond which is so beautiful but you have to pay 500 yen to enter and last entry was 4.30. In the area of the shrine and park by Harajuku station you can also visit Takeshita- Dori street which was one of the most crowded streets I’ve ever seen but very vibrant, such a contrast to the calm of the temple."
42,A great end of day excursion,"Nice quiet, serene. Air is fresh. What can you ask for!!! Especially right in the middle of Tokyo. Try to go on a weekdays and early. After 10am, bus load of tourists."
43,Lovely place to wander ,"Massive, compelling, and inspiring.  Surprising to find in the middle of the massive city of Tokyo, and among the best Tokyo finds if you are looking for scale, history. interest, and authetic Japan in one location.  Be preapred to walk a distance, bring comfy shoes.  Highly recommened."
44,A must visit,"Going to the Meiji Jingu Shrine is a walk of faith for visitors as it takes an average person a good 10 minutes to navigate on a gravel lined path to the shrine itself.  Along the way, you'll be distracted by the lush foliage, and the sounds of nature permeating throughout.  The shrine itself is a monument of beauty, and we were fortunate to witness a wedding ceremony happening on the grounds.  Wonderful place to be in."
45,Interesting/important shrine set in peaceful forest,Such tranquility in the heart of Tokyo. Surrounded by forest and greenery. A very different side of a bustling city. A must to visit.
46,peaceful walk at a great location,"A place to go if you are a fan of nature, history and shrine. It's beautiful. Enjoy the stroll with birds chirping and fresh air."
47,Nice walk,"A few steps away from the hustle and bustle of busy Tokyo, you enter a quiet and serene path.  As you stroll deeper into the man-made sanctuary you find yourself relaxing.  We had limited time and did not explore any structures, but enjoyed the walk and external views.  Ticked by the area where people can bring their vehicles for blessings.  We also enjoyed observing the sake barrel ""wall"". Each barrel wrapped and decorated differently.  Our escort explained that some of these were commercial or ad related, but still so beautiful (especially to those of us that don't read Japanese!)    Recommended for a calming visit and casual stroll"
48,Hatsomode at Shrine,"This calm, serene shrine, set in the hustle of Tokyo, is a wonderful place to meditate and to learn about Japanese history.  It's dedicated to an emperor and his wife, although they aren't actually buried here.  It's set in a large park that's full of beautiful flowers, and it's also apparently (and quite understandably) a popular place for weddings."
49,"Historically and culturally significant for locals, skippable for tourists","A nice long walk to the temple.  Cool fresh air, lots of greenery with an amazing history in the midst of busy Tokyo."
50,Stunning but...,"Go early if it’s hot as a reasonable walk to get there but worth it. Very beautiful and peaceful even when crowded, we saw a couple of wedding parties which was very special, such gorgeous outfits.  Well worth a visit"
51,Peaceful walk,"This place is stunning! We went on a weekday morning and it wasn’t too crowded. The walk to the shrine is shaded and peaceful. The washing of your hands before entering the shrine was amazing to watch. There are instructions in English, but we just observed the locals and followed suit. We were lucky to observe a ceremony going on inside, very moving. This is undoubtedly a highlight of our visit to Tokyo."
52,Gorgeous shrine,"Great cultural experience, put your walking shoes on and step back in time.  Plenty of english info along the way to help you understand the history of this shrine"
53,Amazing,"The Shrine itself is beautiful, but the surroundings truly make this a special place. Walking from the bustle of Tokyo into this peaceful oasis is stunning. Definitely one of the top places to visit in Tokyo."
54,Hire a guide-beautiful place,This is one of my favourite spots in Tokyo in the middle of the forest near Harajuku. So peaceful. Currently the crowds are lower too!
55,One of the Historic Shrines in Tokyo,"Its a long, peaceful walk to the shine from the nearest rail station and on a hot day the wonderfully big trees provided shade.  The shrine was beautiful and it was very pleasant to sit in. shaded spot and just watch people visiting the shrine."
56,Shrine in the city,"A temple to honor an emperor. The place is inside a huge forest, and a beautiful one. It has a lot of very interesting explanations about how the Japanese worship. I found it both very interesting and beautiful, I highly recommend paying this place a visit even if you have a short stay in the city."
57,Good not great,What an absolutely beautiful shrine! The history in Japan is insane and all of these shrines dotted around only add to that. The experience here was lovely and it was a very beautiful place to be able to see
58,Time travel back to the Meiji era within the modern Tokyo City,One the main attraction in Japan. Very different from the buildings in Tokyo. It is very important that you read about it before you go so you can get educated on the proper way to pay respect to the temple as well as the tradition.
59,Impressive!,This is was a really relaxing and serene shrine to visit. What is crazier to think is that this is located in the middle of Tokyo. Even before you can get to the shrine you have to go through the forested park. This is one of those places you have to see in Tokyo if you like history and culture.
60,Go back in time to historical Japan,This is a beautiful Shinto shrine located in a forest; surprisingly inside busy Tokyo.  It is in an impressive green space that is amazingly quiet and calming.  You will enjoy the sounds of birds and smell the pleasant forest greenery.  The history is very interesting and educational.  Touring the site involves a lot of walking and the guiding signage is well numbered to prevent getting lost.  Meiji Jingu Shrine was one of my favorite places to visit while exploring Tokyo.
61,Much loved spot in the heart of Harajukyu,"This is a fantastic place to visit. Amidst the hustle and bustle of the city, this place offers a true escape from the noise and the crowds. The nature trails are exquisite. The temple is beautiful. The abundant shade offers relief from the heat during the summers. It's quiet, peaceful atmosphere allows for reflection. There are many unique plant species to enjoy and a lovely koi pond as well."
62,Worth Visiting,"A real escape from the hustle and bustle. The park is huge with wide walkways so lots of room for everyone. The temple is perfectly maintained, good experience."
63,tells all about japanese architecture,"My favourite spot in Tokyo. A real breath of fresh air abd calm.The park opens from 5 am in the summer,  head there before 9am to avoid the tourists.  It can get incredibly busy during the day which spoils the sacred atmosphere."
64,Beautiful walk in nature to get to shrine!,When in Tokyo we did visit a number of shrines.The shrine is very busy but due to its size and location within a forest the crowds distribute. Well worth the visit to breath a bit of Japan.Some male foreigners in undersized rental kimonos showing off their hairy chest i found simply disturbing and out of place at this still religious place of workship.
65,Peaceful - Meiji Shrine ,After a busy morning in Harajuku it was great to cross the street and enter the peaceful Meiji shrine. If you’re lucky you might even see a wedding take place!
66,Beautiful large shrine,"This shrine is right in the middle of the city but  located in a forest-like garden full of tall trees. The area is so big that even when there are many tourists, it feels peaceful. There are lots of roads running within the forest, leading to and away from the shrine. The shrine itself is a peaceful place with tori gates."
67,Lucky enough to see a wedding to,"I guess I might have expected too much for Japanese temples. It was good that there is a temple in the middle of the city but it was busy and crowded. I could not find anything special compared to other asian countries' temples. Not bad, just average."
68,Lovely walk on a sunny Sunday Morning,We enjoyed the Meiji Jingu Shrine today. The park is beautiful. It’s a great place to be outdoors. The shrine is lovely.
69,Visit Meiji Jingu,"After seeing numerous shrines and temples in Kyoto, as lovely as the Meiji Shrine is, it is not as overwhelming as many other historical sites.  That being said, the walk from the Torii to the actual shrine is quite tranquil and very enjoyable.  Take a few moments to enjoy the 39 foot high main gate or Torii--it is made from 1,500 year old Hinoki Cypress trees.  We also enjoyed the barrels of both sake and burgundy that had been donated to the shrine--great for a picture.  From what I understand, the trees that are now part of the 170 acre complex were donated by people from all throughout Japan. Check out my photos for more details."
70,"Meiji jingu, oasis in the city",The shrine was very huge and interesting and when we arrived there was a service ( not sure if that’s the right word) being carried out so we got to see the whole ceremony. There were a mass of prayer wheels on the way to the shrine and a place with water and bamboo cups to perform washing.We went around 9am and it was fairly quiet but on our way out there were huge amounts of people heading in.
71,Rainy day took nothing away from this beautiful area,Went to this shrine. Very near to Harajuku stationIt was very serene If you have time you can visit
72,Worth A Visit - Very Interesting History,What a beautiful and peaceful walk in a forest in the middle of the city. The trees were beautiful and the shrine was gorgeously well preserved. A must stop while in Tokyo!
73,Rich history and wonderful sights!,We chanced onto the Meiji Jingu Shrine when looking for a shady spot near Harajuku after a long sweaty walk from the Shibuya station. The shrine is a beautiful example of Japanese ability to be both ornate and simple at the same time. The massive structures of unfinished wood are impressive. The visit is free. The shrine is in the midst of a forest like park. Getting there was a pleasant walk in the shade after the hot busy streets of Shibuya and Harajuku.
74,A walk in Meiji shrine,"It’s the most famous shrine in Tokyo. Even though it was built in the middle of the town, the surrounding of the garden and trees can really make you feel relaxed. A must to visit!"
75,Bus City Sights,A peaceful oasis right by the Harajuku subway stop.  Enjoy the beautiful gardens and peaceful surroundings as they make for a lovely walk to get to the Shrine itself.  Splendid and majestic.
76,Worth the walk in,Visit the great shrine for a peaceful and inspiring walk and then go to the road with yellow gingko trees lining the side. Another great place that’s just off the Harajuku station.
77,Beautiful and Serene - if you arrive early,A beautiful temple awaits after a long but nice walk into the forest.  The main shrine is where you want to be.  It’s amazing how they have preserved the area despite so many tourists visiting it.  It’s near the city and just a train station away from Shinjuku station.  A must visit.
78,Beautiful Spot,Wonderful park if you like being amongst nature and walking. Has a private (pay for) garden made for the Empress which had less tourists in it. The shrine was relatively busy for a tourist spot but not unmanageable. Brilliant example of shrines in Japan.
79,Serene spot on the tour,Meiji was a very important man in the shaping of Japan. When visiting a country it is important to learn about the defining moments in history for that place.Gardens are lovely. Walking through the colossal trees was a nice break from the surrounding busy city.
80,Rainy rainy day,"It's just a short walk from Harajuku Station and located in the heart of Tokyo, in the middle of a beautiful, tranquil park with tall woods and singing birds. The Shrine itself is breathtaking and tranquil and seeing it you could never imagine you are surrounded by a metropolis of over 13 million inhabitants. This is place is a must-see if you are interested in history, culture and architecture!"
81,Worth the visit,A very peaceful shrine you could learn about the Japanese history. The shrine is very large in the heart of Tokyo city center and just next to JR Yamanote line - Harajuku station. A very refreshing walk from the entrance for a round walk. You could make a wish in the shrine and get some traditional souvenir from there.A nice spot to learn about the history of Japan.
82,THE GREAT SHRINE AND AUTUMN GINGKO LEAVES,Meiji Jingu Shrine is a place of peace the middle of the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The park that surrounds Meiji Jingu Shrine is lovely. It is dense and green and blocks out any city noise. The large gates are very impressive as you walk to the Shrine. The grounds and bathrooms were clean.
83,Peaceful oasis,Completely beautiful. A very calm and serene shrine. Busy with tourists but still relaxing to walk around. Definitely go to the gardens with the well - costs a small amount and totally worth it!
84,Nice place,"We loved walking to the shrine surrounded by trees, then saw a traditional wedding. A must see if you want to do a bit of “nature bathing” in amongst the craziness of Tokyo."
85,Must visit for a authentic Shinto shrine experience ,"After my 6th trip to Tokyo japan . I finally try a new sightseeing attraction for myself . I’m loving it - Meiji Jingu shrine . Liking the the natural scene over there on all of it . The historical park , building or even those wishes trees . Overall I loved the silence and felt so peaceful. I highly recommended this place to everyone to pay a visit . There’s many IG check in places to snap a nice photo ."
86,A nice place,"A very old shrine, with lots of old tradition, bringging back my tv memories if the ""Samurai"" and the new movie of the ""Last Samurai"" by Tom Cruise and Mr Watanabe"
87,A Great Shinto Shrine!,"Second time to visit since 2 years ago. If you’re planning to get temple stamps (Goshuincho), this should be on your top list. They usually close early, so my advice to visit in the morning. We also witnessed 2 weddings, and they say you’re blessed when you see the couple. Just a tip - exit at Takeshita-dori / Harajuku station (Yamanote Line). It’s the shortest walk and you can also check out Yoyogi Park after your Goshuincho. Make sure to take note areas that you can’t take pictures. Good thing my 7-year-old loves cultural trips like these, too."
88,The most important Shinto Shrine in Tokyo,"We took the train to Shibuya and then walked to the shrine entrance. Once you enter the hustle and bustle of the city just dies away. The lily garden and the pond area (500¥) are lovely. Don't forget to visit the shop close to the entrance, it seems to have nice quality merchandise. Harajuku also very close, you can enjoy multiple changes in atmosphere in one day."
89,Nice serene ,After walking through the park (really a forest within the city) we reached the majestic wooden carved gates of the Meiji Jingu shrine. The two very old trees in the back of the square inner court catch your view. Even there are many visitors but also locals who came to pray there is only a little murmur. Don't forget to exit through the right doors if you entered through the main gate to see also the rest of the buildings.
90,Meiji jingu Shrine Trip,This is really a peaceful oasis and a nice break from the frenetic pace of Tokyo. A truly lovely walk through the woods to the shrine. We were lucky enough to observe a Shinto procession.
91,impressive,"Gorgeous, expansive grounds and shrine buildings are hidden away from the bustle of Harajuku. A lovely walk that takes you away from the noise and into a scene of serenity. If you are lucky you may stumble upon a wedding taking place, as we did."
92, Serene beauty in the heart of Tokyo,"Beautiful Shinto temple to get away from the bustling city. Recommend to go before 9 am to avoid crowds. Also recommend to take a handkerchief and wear comfortable tennis shoes. Since it is a temple, people should try not to shout, fool around, run in the area and respect it. From the entrance try to walk on either side. It is easier to walk and also respectful to the God, who is believed to walk in the middle.Before the shrine, there is a place where you can cleanse your hands. First pour water on your left, then right hand, and finally let the water trickle down the handle for the next user. Then dry your hands with your handkerchief.Let your mind concentrate on the sounds, air, light, woods, nature that you see as you walk to the temple.When you pray, bow once, place the coin in the bin, clap twice, pray, and bow once."
93,"Beautiful, calming experience",Beautiful park and shrine. Quiet and tranquil. Well worth the trip to spend a hour to relax. Easy 5 minute walk from train station.
94,Serene part of tokyo,A must visit if you are in Tokyo. You will have a long walk in the green forest before you enter the temple. Both worth the time. It is right next to the metro station and the famous Takeshita street. Combine them in one visit.
95,Don’t miss,"I really loved this shrine - not joking when I say that it's the best experience I had in Tokyo. The shrine is in the city, but between its location on the hill and the long walk up the path to get there, by the time you get to the shrine it's almost as though you've been transported farther away from the rest of civilization than you really are.This is definitely, definitely worth a visit. I'd highly advise going early to avoid the crowds and really get a chance to experience that walk and the shrine at its most serene."
96,"Astounding gardens, Shrine, teahouse and well.","I find it to be the case at many shrines and temples in Asia that they are not really set up for tourists--they are often crowded with people, but there's very little translation of what you are seeing. This shrine is no exception. However, there is a seriousness and a reverence here that many shrines I have visited lack, and I think part of that is that to get here, you must walk through the most peaceful, wild gardens. You feel calm but invigorated by the time you arrive at the shrine. There were many tourists there--the World Cup was on--but they all seemed to behave a little better than you might expect. It was lovely. There's this couple of trees tied together by ropes representing eternity of marriage and of family. I stood under it and was quite moved as I looked up into the branches that have sort of woven themselves together over the years. I looked around, and I was surrounded by people, but I felt like I was experiencing a moment alone. It was awesome. There was a wedding that day--a really lovely thing to see."
97,Brilliant,This is a huge shrine with much to see. If you are lucky like us you can see babies being blessed or even a wedding.
98,Zen,"Have visited this place a couple of times. A nice stroll into the shrine area from the madness of Harajuku. Huge area, tranquil."
99,A must visit location in Tokyo ,"This shrine is interesting because it is located in the forest in the middle of the city. We didnt quite realize we would be walking through the woods to get to it. However, we did enter at the entrance near Yoyogi Park. I would actually recommend this as no one else was around and it was a nice leisurely quiet walk in the back way. Then we exited through the main entrance walking against the crowds coming in. It actually worked out nice. Bring bug spray as this time of year its humid and the mosquitos are out, even in the middle of the day! The temple itself is beautiful, especially the large wooden arches at each entrance. It was a nice change to see the natural wood and not the brightly painted orange arches that are so popular at every shrine in Japan. Like at most shrines in this city, you can buy a fortune or good luck charms. People were doing this and saying prayers at the main building of the temple. It was nice to sit on a bench in the shade for a bit and have a rest while taking in the peacefulness."
100,Gorgeous in so many ways,We walked past here on the 2.1.20 and found many Japanese people visiting this temple to start the New Year. It is beautifully maintained and so peaceful. The gardens are an easy walk and I think most families would love to experience this beautiful area.
101,My fav place in Tokyo ,"Nice place to walk thru; liked the sake wall; didn't have the ""WOW"" feeling with this place; didn't see the awesomeness in its architect."
102,Relatively quiet oasis in the middle of a huge city,Very busy shrine - queues for ages to get  a stamp in goshuincho book.Beautiful shrine in a beautiful park
103,Sacred sight that has extraordinary history,"Our first stop on our trip to Japan and well worth it. A vast garden with wishing wells, fishing ponds (to look at), Shinto shrines, and famous bottles of Wine and Sake. A great experience"
104,A Shinto Disneyland,"Definitely worth the visit to this sprawling park in Shibuya. Give yourself a couple hours to walk around and see both the shrine and park. Also, make sure you stop by the sake and wine barrels!"
105,Beautiful Shrine and Gardens,"Recommend Meiji Shrine, its very popular and gets busy as important to the Japanese people, nice to wander around and take it the sights and understand more about the shrine."
106,Nearly missed it,"This shrine is one of the most important ones in Tokyo. After a nice walk through the garden, you come to the entrance of the shrine. The shrine is open from 5 am to 6 pm. Getting there early is really important as it gets really crowded later in the day."
107,A Must See Location,A scenic trip with a lovely atmosphere. Not too far to walk from Takeshita Street and definitely a break from the busy streets of Tokyo.
108,Loved the inner garden,A great temple with a traditional feel set in a lot of nice woodland set standing on it's own much more than some of the others.Rather than red colouring this one is dark brown with the same mix of tourists and worshipers.We were luck enough to see a wedding party while we were there as well.
109,Oasis next to the famous Harajuku district! ,"Meiji Shrine is very peaceful and very authentically Tokyo. It's only a few minutes away from Shibuya Crossing and Harajuku, but is relaxing and very enjoyable to walk through. A little overwhelming if you go on New Years Day!"
110,We were there for a special blessing,Took a nice walk in Meiji shrine.. lucky day for me.. caught a wedding couple whom held their wedding at Meiji shrine.. the wedding was beautiful and it’s eye opening for me..
111,The most important shrine in all of Tokyo,What a treat to see a ceremony going on while there! The peacefulness felt and the details of the shrine and surrounding buildings were wonderful.
112,memorable and serene,Beautiful walk to get to the main shrine. If you have time wander around and soak in the nature in the middle of the busy city.  We came here on a rainy day and unfortunately while it was under a bit of construction and yet it still was a beautiful site to see. Not many people were walking around when we came in the winter. I imagine the area would be even more bustling in nicer weather. Worth a stop if you’re hanging out in Harajuku/Shibuya for the day. It’s right off the Harajuku subway station!
113,The must see shinto shrine in Tokyo,"Visited on 2 January and was amazed by the amount of people visiting the shrine for new years! Even though it was crowded, it was still extremely beautiful with a wonderful stroll underneath the trees. Would recommend visiting after sunset if there is a market - the lanterns were lit up and truly changed the atmosphere to something more mythical. Returned a few days later for a photo shoot in traditional kimono attire."
114,Some autumn celebrations these few weeks,"After spending several days squeezing into subway trains, strolling along the neon lit alleys of Shinjuku and fighting through the hordes of Shibuya Crossing, visiting Meiji Temple was a welcome repast.  At my daughter’s urging to see something cultural, we decided to visit Meiji Temple.  From the Tokyo Station, Google offered several recommended transit routes.  I decided to take what appeared to be the most direct route to the temple.  After exiting the subway station in a residential neighborhood, we followed a path by a horse stable and what looked like an isolated dead-end street.  There was nothing that appeared to be a tourist site or a temple.  We had visited Asakusa Temple the day before and fought through thousands of tourists to visit one of the most commercialized religious sites in the world. There was nothing that appeared to resemble a similarly popular tourist site. We followed an elderly woman through a path into a park located at the end of the block and discovered one of the most serene places I’ve been.  Beyond a small guard shack there was what appeared to be an archway one would expect at a temple.  Believing that we were on the right path we proceeded through a beautiful tree lined pathway with open fields and few other travelers. Although we had not yet come across a temple, out of curiosity we continued on.  Finally, we came across some fellow visitors heading in the opposite direction who confirmed that we were on the right path to the temple. I felt that we were on a pilgrimage.We finally came across the Temple and now scores of visitors.  We realized that we had entered the Temple from the back though a less traveled route and now were amongst throngs of tourists.  The Temple is a traditional large courtyard with a shrine where devotees could make offerings.  This is a working religious center where there are several buildings dedicated to Shinto religious practitioners.  There isn’t much to see at the temple itself but wander through the park surrounding the temple and the trip is well worth the journey.  If you arrived at the Temple from the Harajuku/Shibuya entrance, do not get discouraged by the crowds, exit through the back of the Temple and explore the park away from the throngs of tourists, literally bus loads and bus loads of tourists.  However, if you want to spend a day away from the concrete, multi story shopping complexes and crowds of people,  the park is a lovely way to spend the day.There is a very modern visitors center with a café, rest rooms, and a full service restaurant.  We stopped at the café and had a snack.  The food served at the café was surprising very good and very inexpensive.  They offer a full range of Japanese food from soba to curry rice and pizza.  Get away from the crowds and explore the park grounds.  Serene and beautiful."
115,Peaceful and beautiful,The ambience if this place will move you. The nature and the visitors add to its charm. If your lucky enough you may even see a Shinto wedding!
116,Great great,Going to Meiji Shrine was one of our itinerary while in Japan.Great place to visit..very accessible to everything.From Harajuku station.. we walked to the shrine..First stop to see and take photos of their iconic Sake Barrels.Great and beautiful Tori Gates.. Amazing..Going to the shrine.. wash hands first before entering n offering prayers and wishes..What a great experience indeed❤️
117,Meiji Jingu,"Everyone, vloggers and travel writers rave about this place. I give it a big MEH!  First it is big site with a lot of walking. Visually it is attractive. The shrine is in a park like area. In March, we didn't have overwhelming crowds, but we did visit on a Friday. I just was not impressed. For Japanese, this place represents an era. But I wouldn't waste the 2+ hours it takes to get in the site. I did it once, never again. There are more fascinating places in Tokyo."
118,Morning stroll,What a relief from the hustle of Tokyo traffic.....this perfect shrine brings total relaxation as you walk through its grounds. The highlight is the lake and beautiful garfens. The grounds are immaculately manicured. The temple is spiritual and well worth a visit.
119,Worthwhile visit,This is a major shrine and one of the most visited in Tokyo.  We took a train to visit this shrine near Harajuku station. Yoyogi park is nearby. Quite a peaceful shrine.
120,Amazing story of how Japan has changed over last 130y,"Just a short walk from busy Harajuku station, in the beautiful Yoyogi Park, there is this piece of tranquil zone with amazing shrine. Take your time to walk around both park and shrine, and if you visit it in right time you might catch a glimpse of old Japan..."
121,Great outdoor escape in central Shinjuku. ,Visited recently on a trip with teens from Australia studying Japanese. Loved the shrine and the culture associated with entering.
122,Part if a booked bike tour,"i love visiting all places of worship and shrines .regardless of beliefs, the sheer vibrations of this place make it a must see.get a prayerbook and get the seal from every shrine you visit"
123,Special place,"Great park and a must visit to catch the story of how Japan has changed over the last 130years take time not only to see the fantastic buildings but read the stories of how the 100,000 trees where planted and how Japan opened up to western cultures but has still maintained there values"
124,Beautiful Meiji,This l shrine is set in a man made forest with thousands of trees lining its entrance and exit. A very peaceful walk towards the shrine immediately helps you relax whilst passing through the tori gates. Very respectful area where the spirits are at peace.
125,Hands down - best experience in Tokyo,Lovely shrine and a beautiful and serene walk.  Talking a guide allowed us to learn more about what everything meant.
126,Quite moved,I’d been warned that it gets very busy here but it was absolutely fine when we went. The park is lovely and green and the shrine is beautiful.
127,Wow - what a beautiful & peaceful place ,"This was the first shrine I visited in Japan and it doesn't disappoint.The entrance and walkway is vast leading up to the shrine and when you get there the courtyard (can it be called that) is really beautiful.It's such a special place, good to sit down and reflect on life or just watch people go by.The architecture and materials used to build these shrines is hard to comprehend, just fabulous."
128,Special place in a beautiful park,"Meiji Jingu has a lot of signficance for the locals being dedictaded to Emperor Meiji- the one who restored Japan into modern world and is the spot for New Year gathering. However for tourists it doesn’t compare in it’s pure beauty to a lot of Kyoto shrines, and the main temple is not awe inspiring by any stretch. What is pretty amusing is the wine barrels donated by Japanese to the emperor and his wife. It’s location conveniently off Takeshita-dori Street in Harajuku is nice for visiting, and so is the fact that it’s free. So worth a go, but keep your expectations low."
129,Park next to it makes the difference,"After the hustle & bustle (code for - hassle & crowds) of Shibuya and the Shopping experience, this made a refreshing change ......Peace and quiet.Wide avenues.No one bashing into youThis hour was my kind of City"
130,Large major shrine,"This is a wonderful Shrine and Gardens in central Tokyo near Shibuya Station. We came through the other entrance and worked out way through the Gardens and Shrine. Keep in mind no outside food or drink is allowed in and a guard is at the gates to be sure of that. But there is a place you can get a snack and drink once inside. There a number of water fonts throughout the gardens. They are there to express respect and not specifically religious beliefs as I understand it. Approach the font and rinse your left hand in the water, then your right hand, then cup the water in your hand and rinse your mouth, then rinse your left hand again. Use normal hygiene so as not to contaminate the water, the dipper or the water you rinse in your mouth. It may sound complicated but watch a few locals do it before you jump in and it's a great picture moment while you are there. Continue walking through the gardens and get to the temple in the center. There you can pay your respects by dropping a coin in the slot and praying or remembering loved ones. Again, watch the locals to see how to do it properly. Weave your way past the wine casks. You can read about why they are there. Around the same area there is a private garden you can pay a few dollars to walk through if you are so inclined. When you get to the other end of the gardens you are dropped off in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Shibuya where you can eat and do some high end shopping."
131,Meiji,"Beautiful forest and shrine inside the city. The walk from the train station was pleasant. Being a holiday weekend, it was busy with visitors, but pretty organized. Interesting to see the Saki and Wine for consecration on the way to the shrine."
132,Serene,"After an entry gate you are in ancient forest, walking on a wide pathway towards a shrine. Total opposite for hustle and bustle in Shibuya streets."
133,Tranquil and beautiful shrine,Still a very beautiful place to visit with lotsa people. Very vast area and needed a lot of walking. A must visit for first timer.
134,Impressive ,The temple is quite large and the visitors are here in numbers !!!  Anyway yo have to make a stop there but spend time in the nearby garden very quiet and beautiful for its harmony
135,One of the most important Shinto Shrines in Japan - beautiful,A pleasant visit. Nice and clean. It's big and amazing. Must come and visit if you were in Tokyo. Its raining when I was there.  But it doesn't stop us..
136,Popular Tokyo Tourist Destination,"My favourite place in Tojyo, simple as that. When combined with its gardens this wonderful, beguiling shrine will keep you captivated for hours as it did me.The main shrine is stunning with is huge torii and beautiful colours  I loved the row of burgundy wine barrels and sake barrels opposite, gifts for the consecration of the shrine.. There is a beautiful prayer wall too on the right as you look at the main shrine.They ive you a nice little guide going in and you starmp it yourself with a lovely old ink stamper.The pair of sacred Camphor trees in the forecourt are gorgeous. One was planted in memory of the Emperor who died in 1912, the other for the Empress who passed in 1920. They are two trees tended to look like one, a beautiful sentiment.Now, one main bit of advice. Don't limit yourself just to the main shrine. Wander around the grounds as there are some simply gorgeous smaller ones dotted about. Anyway, a wonderful, spiritual place, very moving and captivating. An absolute must do."
137,Peaceful shrine in the woods - great place,"One should not miss this place for the sake of the park next to it.We were bid bored of shrines visit after been to kyoto. If you have visited enough shrines, pls skip to the park"
138,Absolutely Beautiful,"We went to the Meiji Shrine on the second day of our Tokyo trip.Very easy to find after leaving Harajuku station.Lovely walk up to the Shrine thru a couple of vast Torii gates.Some maintenance work currently going on, but didn't really detract from the special feeling from the shrine and its aura. A must see if you are in Tokyo"
139,Sacred shrine in the brace of green forest.,"Peaceful and cool, this is a tranquil oasis in Tokyo. Large, well maintained and very popular. The shrine is classic layout and large. We observed a ceremony and said our prayers, bought our charms.  May I please ask you to observe the rules and customs: do not walk down the center of the roads, keep to the sides, and do not use the center gate of the shrine it is not for people. And lastly, please observe the ""no photography"" signs"
140,Great walk in a Park,A lovely walk through a forest brings you to the shrine. The setting is lovely & serene. I felt the walk made the shrine feel much more peaceful and a world away. Enjoyed the Meiji Jingu shrine.
141,Beautiful serene place,"This shrine and surrounding forest/park is beautiful and tranquil. It’s a decent walk from the entrance to the main shrine area, so wear comfy shoes! When you’re there you can pay your respects (don’t worry there are instructions on how to do so) and also purchase a little wood placard to write your wishes on."
142,"Another big temple.., look for the garden ","A large park area - over 100,000 trees with large and level pathways. Great place on a hot day. Easily accessible from the subway. See the Sake Barrels stacked to honour the Emperor. The entrance to the Shrine, called the Torii, is the largest in Japan and is a fitting gateway to the magnificent Shrine. 2020 is its 100th anniversary. The larger gift shop is excellent and there is good food available here. Plan 2 - 4 hours."
143,Favourite place ,"This is a beautiful place to have a photoshoot with a distinctive Japanese taste. It is common for the ladies to visit with traditional clothing, which adds to the atmosphere. There are many stalls to buy goods from, and the temple itself is very beautiful. Around it, there are many smaller shrines and features that are worth watching as well."
144,Peaceful and beautiful ,"I really liked Meiji shrine because the colors of their buildings and torii gates constrast nicely with the surrounding nature, occationally you can also see a Shinto style weddings."
145,Wonder Off from the Crowds,"Nice, peaceful and easy walking amongst the forests to the shrine. An interesting shrine and a lovely place to visit"
146,Peaceful sanctuary,We were there on a Sunday and saw four wedding processions. It was interesting- certainly busy with weddings. There are a range of buildings with the main temple being quite simple. There are nice walking paths in the gardens also and it is quite peaceful. It is a bit of a walk but you can also visit the hip young shopping area where you can see the weird and wonderful colourful Japanese youth.
147,Interesting place,"The Meiji Jingu Shrine is a must see on any tour to Tokyo. Beautiful well kept grounds and a very peaceful and serene spot to be quiet and take in the amazing architecture.A shrine built by the emperor, it has all the hallmarks of royalty. We happened to be there on a wedding day of a traditional Japanese bride. Even though we did not see the ceremony, we were able to witness her in her traditional attire being escorted to the shrine and other important spots to pay homage to the deities. The weather was misty so it gave the whole appearance at the shrine a mystical ambiance."
148,My first Shinto shrine,"Be prepared for a longish walk, but certainly a lovely walk.  Wonderful to see such a sanctuary in the middle of a very large city.  The coffee shop at the entrance was a great place to sit down and people watch at the end of the visit."
149,Beautiful and peaceful!,"Visited this shrine while on a walking tour one day, we had a guide & she was able to give us lots of information.  The entrance gate is enormous & i loved the saki & wine bottles lining the path up to shrine. It was a good experience & i would recommend."
150,Beautiful ,This temple is in the heart of Tokyo. This is one of the popular shrine to visit in Tokyo. You will find it as a lovely place surrounded by thousands of tree. It is prohibited to take picture inside the shrine.
151,Peaceful stroll through the premises,A beautiful shrine. Many shrines have become too commercial and the Meiji Jingu Shrine has retained its elegance and solemn vibe. The Kiyomasa's Well is small and not much to see but provides an escape from the crowd.
152,not to be missed,"Lovely Shrine with beautiful grounds for walking around. Nice to look at some of the people who have come for a special ceremonial blessing. Dressed in traditional clothing, people of all ages go to the shrine at certain times in their lives."
153,Shrine Experience ,"I arrived very early on this area and I really recommend that in order to avoid crowds and so that you get to enjoy the peace and tranquility of the place. The temple is very simple, built in wooden style. But its simplicity is exactly what makes it even more beautiful and special. I had a better experience here than I had at the amazingly packed Senso-Ji, for instance. The Inner Gardens of the Temple are the absolute highlight here and are truly NOT TO BE MISSED. They do charge you 500 yen for admission in the gardens, but this was a lovely walk at one of the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen with different blossoms at each season of the year. We visited in June, and I heard that was the best time of the year to visit it, so I felt very glad and lucky. A consolation prize for having missed the Sakura (Cherry Blossom)."
154,Beautiful shrine where you can feel the spiritualism,The shrine is set within an enormous park with lots of trees. As befitting an imperial shrine it is very impressive. Be prepared to walk quite a bit.
155,Very interesting!!!,Quite a walk before we reach the shrine. But it was a nice walk (especially if the weather is good). The shrine itself is pretty nice and spacious so quite a few good photo spots. But it can be touristy on weekends. We were lucky to caught a wedding procession when we visited. It was interesting to watch.
156,Nice but smaller temple,A must visit Shrine in Tokyo. We were very lucky to see a traditional Japanese wedding in procession. It brought our experience to another level! Recommended for visitors who have never been to a Japanese Shrine.
157,Famous and pleasant Shrine ,"An imposing modern shrine which is away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Entry is free but the gardens are charged for, cafe, toilets and shop all on site."
158,Walking tour,"Is really a place worth visiting. Very relaxing and peaceful place. Need to spend some time to walk around and enjoy the scenery. Make your wish and also able to buy some lucky charms for friends and relatives. Plan a morning visit, hopefully to witness a traditional wedding ceremony. Is amazing."
159,Best Shrine in Tokyo,"Tranquil place, better to go with a guide who can provide some background information and explain the rituals etc. Charms are sold (eg. for passing exams, better job etc)."
160,The shrine was lovingly rebuilt after WWII and its showed,"This lovely Shinto shrine is located in Shibuya and is located on enormous forested grounds in the middle of busy Tokyo.  We saw a few vans so there must be some tours and transportation, but most people seem to take the long walk through the forested area.  We walked from one end to the other and found it rather exhausting but fortunately it is all shaded & overall pleasant."
161,Experiencing Tranquility in the heart of Tokyo,Beautiful scenery and perfect place for a family walk. Good area to take pictures and enjoy nature/trees.
162,Natural Haven in Shibuya ,"I am sure there are tons of info on internet, but just a couple of points from personal experience: definitely go during a week on a non-holiday. Even then it’ll be busy. For travelers with kids, there are public restrooms at the shrine, behind the gates with the train station name. O the photos it’s behind the gate to Sangubashi Station. Also by these restrooms is a well where you can do the washing rituals. Empty, no people. As opposed to the well in the front of the main entrance overcrowded with tourists"
163,Glorious Japanese Shrine,This large shrine is in a very large green open space in the middle of the city. The entrance to the shrine has arches/gates at each entrance. At the main entrance you walk by a large row of sake barrels and wine barrels.Outside the entrance of the shrine building there is a cleansing station where you cleanse before entering the shrine itself. This process alone was very interesting!Very interesting and very ancient site. Well worth a couple hours. We saw a couple who was getting married in typical Japanese culture which was interesting.
164,Serene place,"Loved the sake wall, the two 12 meters toriis, the walk to the shrine and all the details like the lamps. We weren't lucky and didn't see a Shintoism wedding. We went on Monday at 10am on August."
165,Japanese Shrines,"A very nice shrine, with lots of English information through the path. There's quite a beautiful park that surrounds it as well."
166,Shinto Ceremony is awesome!,In the heart of the city the walk up to the shrine is set in beautiful gardens.  There are great views of the city close to the Imperial Palace .
167,Just an OK,"Like it very much, has a part where the un born aré been takes care about, Great area Togo, very near Tokyo tower"
168,a really nice sanctuary,You can find out more about Emperor Meiji here. The shrine is huge and it provides many photo-worthy views as well. It is extremely accessible as it is just right next to the train station.
169,Great Shrine hidden from all the business of Tokyo.,"Such a lovely respite from the bustling city. Lovely grounds with such history. Easy to roam about with wonderful displays explaining the history and current shrine events. Additional displays commemorating the centennial as well. Maps are readily available at various entrances and easy to read. Also, easy access public lavatories, and cafe."
170,Great for pics but don't waste time here.,this is a very unique and great experience for me. plenty of photo opportunities. the temple is interesting and special from a foreigner point of view.
171,Shrine Surrounded by Forest Inside Tokyo,"WOW  the  whole   area  is  just fantastic  to  walk  around   chill  out, the shine  is not to  far  from  shibuya crossing,  I use  the metro to  get  around  Tokyo,   when I'm  in  the area That  I  want then  I just  walk  every  where   and  just   love   it.So  This  Shrine  covers   a  very large area,  this  is my   second  visit and  I just  happened upon  a  wedding it  was  just  fantastic  and I  managed  to  photograph the  procession it  was beautiful  the  bride  looked  so  gorgeous. As  soon as you enter  the  large arch way  you  can  here  the noisy critters  fascinating and  I evenmanaged  to record them,  I  must  have  stayed   here   at  least  21/2  hours  as  it  is  so  lovey  here  I  just  wanted  to  stay.   It was  very  busy  with  visitors  but  its vast  and there was plenty  of  room  to  move  about.This  place  is  very  easy to  find, I  walk  very  quickly so it  took  me  about  20 mins    from  shibuya  crossing and I  visited  some  shops on the wayCheck  out the  good  luck  tree"
172,A very nice temple,First of all the walk to the shrine is beautiful.  It is like walking in a forest.  It was very calming.  There were little creeks along the path.  It is just amazing that this is in the middle of Tokyo.  The Shrine itself is very ornate and well taken care of.  It is just beautiful.  It took us a morning to walk around.  I think you could spend even longer.  It was just such a nice calming morning.
173,Calming,I have been to Tokyo at least once every year since 2015 and always go to the Meiji shrine first. I don’t know why but it’s one of the few places in the world were I always feel relaxed. The sounds of the crows and the rustling of the trees are very soothing. Just don’t go to it on new year if you don’t feel comfortable in big crowds. You will be in one for 3 hours at least.
174,Not so special,A lovely Shinto shrine which I throughly enjoyed visiting. Conveniently located and luckily when I visited I saw few weddings taking place which was an added attraction. One should definitely include it in ones itenary when visiting Tokyo.
175,Worth seeing,Still has maintained some semblance of a sacred place despite the tourists wandering around. Lovely place & park to walk around. Happened upon what appears to be a wedding ceremony & a local advised against paying into see the Kiyomasa’s well as the garden isn’t currently in bloom this time of year
176,Tranquillity in the middle of Tokyp,Beautiful attraction. The history about the shrine was very interesting. Even more beautiful in person
177,Beautiful peaceful place in centre of Tokyo ,"This shrine was packed with people, but you could still navigate through and get to experience everything the shrine had to offer. We were here on a tour, so we didn't get to explore the surrounding area too much, but you could easily spend three hours in the general vicinity."
178,Beautiful Shrine in the forest in the middle of the city!,"Really interesting to see the proud families in traditional dress, lovely peaceful place and a great walk through the woods to find it."
179,Amazing place,"This shrine is just 100 years old, a baby compared to many of the shrines in Japan.  It has informative signs describing the sake and wine barrels, as well as a nice Inner Garden area (for an fee)."
180,An oasis in Tokyo,Top tourist destination. Visitors can place their vows in a particular point of the beatiful garden all around the shrine. Gates at the entrance and and close to shrine make part of the experience.
181,Beautiful gardens,"This is very close to Takeshita street in Harajuku. The walk inside is really beautiful, great green scenery. There are also internal gardens that cost 500 yen to visit, also really well taken care of and beautiful. the shrine is very nice too."
182,Largest in Tokyo,"After chatting with a local guide, it was explained to me, that a person could visit this sacred site three times during their life. Once as a child, once when they come of age and thirdly when they get married. The traditional outfits that are worn are so beautiful, I would recommend asking a parent first prior to just taking a picture of their son or daughter, it shows respect and understanding. There is also a lot of history with both the wine barrels and the sake barrels, make sure that you read this."
183,An absolute must.,First time here and I loved it. Very historic and traditional. Great pictures were taken and good memories created!
184,Tokyo trip,"Not sure what has happened to this place, but there were so many tourists that it lost all its peacefulness and beauty. Even the park surrounding it was heaving with hoards of people, which was surprising to see on a rainy day. Definitely something to see for a first time visitor, tick the box and then go see some smaller quieter shrines outside of Tokyo."
185,Peacefull and serine ,"Living in Asia, we've seen our share of shrines, but this one really had a unique spirit about it, so don't miss it out. Also take the time to walk around the park it is in, it's beautiful, wild and relaxing. It's best to go there on a Sunday and maybe catch a glimpse at a traditional wedding ceremony!"
186,A must see stop for all tourists.,"We were lucky enough to visit the shrine while there was a wedding going on so we got to experience part of the ceremony. It’s in the middle of the city next to one of the noisiest areas. However, while you are walking inside the park around the shine all you hear are birds!!!"
187,You have to see a shrine,I found this shrine by accident while I had some time to kill and it's just lovely.  Such an incredibly peaceful place despite it being just off the main road.  Loved the koi pond and just walking around the whole area although it would've been fantastic to have been able to sit nearby and absorb the tranquillity.
188,Average,"This shrine is not colorful or flashy like Senso-ji and is very serene and set in a forest. The massive torii gate is cypress. I did love the colorful sake barrels along the way. This Shinto Shrine also has the rituals of hand cleansing, writing wishes and tying onto a prayer wall, bowing and clapping. My guide told me 3 million people make the walk here for New Year on Jan 1 and it can take hours in the cold! This shrine means a lot to these people. It also was badly damaged in WWII and restored."
189,"Beautiful, tranquil shrine ","What a beautiful place....From the entrance to the road that leads you up to the shrine, there are a lot of displays with explanations about the shrine and it’s history.It is presented in a beautiful way along the side of the pass .The shrine itself is a beautiful architecture structure of the Japanese emperor history.You can write wishes for Health, Good companionships, success in studies, good fortune etc,The monks will take the requests and for a contribution, they will pray for you."
190,Impressive Shrine and garden,"It's a nice walk through history. And a nice walk, too. Conveniently located and so it's packed with tourists. But that doesn't matter as the place is huge."
191,A stark contrast to the bustling city,Had a great time walking through the area and seeing the shrine. We had great weather which made it a lot more enjoyable. Great for kids too.
192,Simply Simple,"This is our first sightseeing spot in Japan. We arrived relatively early in the morning and it was very quiet and peaceful. The whole area is huge, we walked around for an hour and only see a small part of the park."
193,Mediocre...,This is a beautiful tree-filled area that is cool on the hottest day. The shrine itself is large and hosts a number of fascinating cultural and religious festivals. It’s possible to wander around for hours.
194,Simply Beautiful ,The shrine and surrounding buildings and structures are well looked after and beautiful. It’s good to see it well patronised by the japanese.
195,Japanese wedding and delightful park,"Though trains are racing by on the east of the park, this is a pleasant, relaxing park for strolling. The Shinto shrine to Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken is definitely worth a sacrificing a few hours from the hectic Tokyo city life. When exiting Harajuku Station, turn right (south) and walk to the first cross-street, turning west (right) and you will arrive at the gate for the park."
196,Beautiful and peaceful,"In addition to the shrine, I also recommend the garden which has awesome scenery (just make sure to get in before 4pm). The garden also has a stamp right by the admission booth, if you collect those."
197,Nice grounds ,Well maintained and somehow really well sound proofed park that houses the shrine from the Meiji era. Really great place to take a stroll through the park and get a sense of what it was like back then.
198,First stop in Japan,really nice temple- we spend about 1 hour to visit the temple. Really great feeling pure- refresh.In general good palace to see in Tokyo.
199,"Beautiful park and shrine, worth visit",As an Historic shrine right behind Harajuku Station we decided to go.  Two days after New Year there were still large crowds going to the shrine but it is amazing how security and the people maintain order.  Its located in a forest within Tokyo and you can't hear any sounds of the city.  If you've seen a lot of shrines it may not be high on you list of things to see.  There were so many people visiting the shrine for Hatsumode that we didn't really have a good look at the shrine.
200,Well worth a visit,"Set in beautiful and peaceful gardens, this Shinto shrine in a real contrast to the Buddhist shrine in Asakusa."
201,Avoid tour Group(Bus),"This shrine is set in gorgeous woodland all begun around 100 years ago, when the shrine itself was built, but yet which feels utterly natural. It's a peaceful oasis in the midst of Tokyo and hard to believe that shopping culture is a short walk away! The shrine itself is a fair walk into the park, but well worth it - beautiful, calming and peaceful in itself. You sense the reverence and respect with which the shrine was built."
202,Beautiful Walk,Beautiful gardens to stroll thru.  There were many 3-5-7 ceremonies with children taking place while we were there. It was lovely. Definitely a must see
203,Peaceful shrine,Pure bliss.  Got to see a Japanese wedding.  The walk up to the shrine is amazing.  I would definitely return.
204,Oasis in the middle of Tokyo ,very good to walk around see the intricate work of art of this shrine for its Japanese architecture and one can see people all over the world.
205,Fresh air in the city,"As we walked into the temple grounds, we were shocked by how different this place was to the rest of Tokyo. Giant trees covered the landscape and remoteness of the shrine within the park made it seem like we were miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Ample toilet facilities meant that we could take care of our baby, and chairs outside the cafeteria and in the shrine area helped us rest and recover. The shrine itself was a beautiful reminder of Japanese traditional landmarks at its best."
206,170 acre forested shrine near Harajuku Metro Station.,Beautiful park-hiring a guide was very worthwhile (Hiro). Spoke English well and has some person stories of the park which was fun - along with the historical significance.
207,So beautiful,"Beautiful, calm peaceful walk from Harajuku station up through the park, screaming hot day so glad of the shade. Beautiful shrine area to look around, lots to see and some great photos to be had. Half way down on the way back found a very nice cafe to get a drink to cool down, also outside stalls selling ice creams etc - very welcome."
208,Well worth the walk,"I visited this Meiji Jingu on June on sunny day. There were so many trees like a pretty jungle. This place so wide, that we are exhausted. And we just walked until sake barrels. We can reach this place by exit on Harajuku (Meiji Jingu mae)"
209,Great visit,Strolling around the gardens was a treat. The teahouse is a blank canvas of early twentieth century Japanese lore. You'll swear you can see the beautiful kimonos wandering the weaving paths to the spring water well.
210,Peaceful and beautiful,The Meiji Shrine is a very impressive temple. It was quite a long walk from the Harajuku train station but well worth the walk. It was surrounded by lots of trees and bamboo plants. We enjoyed the walk and the scenery
211,Peaceful Break,The entrance is located near the metro station.  Once you pass under the first Torii Gate it is a long walk to the Shrine through a park like setting.  It was opened in 1920 to honor Emperor and Empress Meiji.  The two large Torii gates are the largest in Japan and made from cypress trees more than 1700 years old.  While we were there we experienced a wedding procession with the wedding party in traditional Japanese dress.  A wonderful experience.
212,Peace and tranquillity ,"Our first stop in our Harajuku and  Shibuya day is Meiji Jingu Shrine. It was a bright sunny wintery morning, perfect walk towards the huge Torii gate, past the sake barrels (and the less noticeable wine french bottles, just opposite). This shrine named after the first emperor of modern Japan, Emperor Meiji, is a Shinto shrine and very much different from Sensoji temple (a Buddhist temple).This temple is vast and grand. We had an opportunity to witness a shinto wedding procession that took place on that day."
213,A must see,Wonderfully peaceful walk amongst the trees and learnt a lot of history from the tourist information provided throughout the walk
214,A beautiful shrine,Harajuku metro station close to park entrance then a  10 minute walk to the main shrine site passing through some huge imposing Torii gates as well as Saki and French wine barrels.l with interesting history. As mentioned by other travellers the shrine is the most important rather than the most imposing Tokyo shrine due to its dedication to the the much revered moderniser Meiji Jingu emperor. It is still an interesting shrine but always remember this is a place of worship requiring the attendant respect and etiquette. The paths around the forest are cool and peaceful in the heart of the Tokyo bustle. Must do Tokyo experience and best visited with a knowledgeable guide.
215,Taking photos and good air,"The entrances to the shrine were very beautiful and gave of a ghibli vibe. The trees were tall and the temperature was cool even for the summer. There is nothing much that’s interesting in the shrine besides it’s historical value. There are shops that sell lucky charms, as well as restaurants and other touristy things nearby. I won’t recommend this place if you are going for friends seeking unique experiences."
216,Beautiful & large shrine,"Definitely a must to visit and if you're lucky, you may chanced upon wedding ceremonies that are taking place!"
217,Lovely garden and shrine - great first day adventure in Toyko,Being considered the most important Shinto shrine in Tokyo makes it a Tokyo highlight. Both the emperor Meiji and his wife are enshrined there. The main shrine is accessed by a wide gravelled road under a huge wooden gate. The curving roofs of the shrines are said to be examples of the finest Shinto style architecture.  A votiv area can be seen in the courtyard and is worth the visit as well.
218,Stunning ,"The entrance frame (which is called Tori I) is really huge. I walked from Harazuku station to the first Tori-I, already flow of visitors is moving in and moving out. It is a long walk until reaching the third Tori-I to see the shrine in sight. Large crowd of visitors going in and going out and around. At the shrine front clap hands three times and drop contribution and come back. Large and tall trees all around like in a forest, Flower exhibitions along the wide pedestrian-only street. It is a serene, sober, respectful worship place.  It is main part of Japanese culture. I came to visit Tokyo I tried hard not to miss this place due to long distance of walking."
219,Hot Day in Tokyo,"Meiji Jingu Shrine is the most visited and popular shrine in all of Tokyo. Being located right next to the Yoyogi Park in the vibrant district of Harajuku, you have great access to it.The surrounding forest and the walking paths are very nice in a spring month.You can by yourself a good luck charm of visit the nearby gardens for the full experience.10/10 would recommend!"
220,Peace when everything else keeps moving.,This attraction should not be missed too. You'll understand a bit of their history and culture. It would be nice to jog here in mornings of spring and summer.
221,Breathing tradition,"The park, surrounding the shrine is good enough for a visit. But probably the magnet  is Meiji. You may clean your hands and drink a bit before entering. Or you may prefer to watch the locals to do so, cleaning their souls and bodies before entering the shrine. You also may leave a wish and it might happen. At the moment part of the complex is under restoration, but it is worth the walk."
222,Must do in Tokyo,"This was my favourite p,lace in Tokyo and we nearly missed seeing it because it was low on our list of things to do, how lucky we managed to fit it in on our last day in the city. The shrine is located in a large forested park which is good for enjoying a stroll, there is a charge to enter the Meioji Jingu gardens but it is worth it.There are several Torii gates around the shrine and one is enormous, supposedly the biggest in Japan. The shrine itself is very impressive and while we were there a wedding blessing in progress with the bride & groom in traditional dress as were most of the ladies, they all looked beautiful. Apparently this is fairly common occurrence at the shrine so there is a good chance of seeing one. For a complete contrast after visiting the shrine we walked down Takeshita Street which is not far from the entrance - it's very popular with locals at weekends and the shops are very tacky."
223,Beautiful shrine in the heart of Tokyo,My wife and I did an escorted walking tour of this shrine.  This was day 1 of our Japan tour.  It was an easy walk around.  Even witnessed a wedding at the shrine.  This is a significant shrine in Tokyo and well worth a look.
224,long walk from the nearest station,Bit of a walk in but beautiful surrounds. Interesting for a quick visit and insight into culture. Good to have guide as you need to understand cultral rituals.
225,Peaceful Oasis,"This is a large temple complex with a number of impressive tori gates along the way.  Situated not far from Harajuka station (5 minutes walk) and set in lovely, peaceful surrounds.  Makes a nice break from the city atmosphere."
226,Serenity In the heart of Tokyo,"Lovely, just lovely. I  got off at Yoyogi station, I would recommend this route going to Yoyogi Park and Meiji shrine. Cause you get to see a little bit of Yoyogi area and it’s people, it’s so different from Harajuku. Ppl say hi to each other there. Walk along the route to Meiji shrine which is a great place. The routes and space in it is part of the whole Meiji experience. You cannot just look at the shrine itself. And don’t forget the trees in the shrine, I sort of wonder if someone do attend to them or they just grow to the shape they are. There are 3 trees there that the Japanese consider them to be sacred. Enjoy the Meiji shrine."
227,Loved it!,"We took the Ginza Line from our 'b' Shimbashi Tokyo Hotel with 1 transfer to the Harajuku Metro Station.  Crossing the bridge, we noted the 1964 Yoyogi National Gymnasium (1964 Olympics) then made our way to the 1st torigi arch marking the south entrance to this 1926 shrine. It opened to a wide pedestrian lane through the quiet 100 year old forest for 1 km, passing the odd Burgundy/Sake Barrel displays, then winding to the 2nd Grand Torigi Arch (40'H x 56' W utilizing 1500 year old cypress trees from Taiwan) to the 3rd torigi arch fronting the 2 story Main Gate to the Meiji Shrine Compound.  Arriving at 10 AM, we joined other tourists, locals, and 3 guided tour groups enjoying this serene natural atmosphere in the middle of Tokyo.  We used the clean restrooms on the return to the metro."
228,The serenity of Japan in the middle of Tokyo,"If you go during summer, I suggest going in the morning or the afternoon (around 5pm) and couple this with a walk through Yoyogi Park (close to Harjuku station) which is a 2 minute walk from the Southern Entrance to the shrine. Read up on how to pay your respects beforehand here on the Meiji Jingu website. The actual grounds are shaded throughout and magical to walk through, if you walk slowly, stop to take photos, it would take you a couple of hours to really appreciate the shrine and grounds, although you could easily do a few laps of the grounds and spend a few hours here. There a public toilets situated within the park which was useful and there is no entrance fee."
229,WOW its  Big & Amazing so  much  to  check  out a  very  lovely  place  to visit,"Went there the first time and it's closed at 4pm so had to go back on another day. Really great place. Once you entered the park, all the noises from the cars/ the city's noise are gone. It feel so peaceful and silent there. Really a relaxing place."
230,Fantastic place with a lot of nature,"The gardens the self would be worth the visit, the golden leafed trees were stunning and provided cover from the rain. Very busy on a Saturday but this did not subtract from it. Grab a pamphlet at the entrance for plenty of information"
231,Beautiful ,"We visited this sacred place on Sunday after  typhoon hagibis lashing Tokyo metro.However, the weather was so perfect with clear blue sky and sunshine. There were 2 wedding pageants of bride,bridegroom and their relatives. It ' solemnly sacred ceremony at this place. Many tourists visited shrine complex, with two couple trees and place for making our wishes with Ema."
232,A classic Tokyo experience,This was one of my first visits and I was amaze. The information available to me from internet was helpful.it was a wonderful experience.Avoid large tour group(Tour bus)!
233,A must to visit!,"This is 173 acres of gardens and magnificent shrine to Emperor Meiji who is known for modernizing Japan in the late 1800s. Lovely walk. Also see the gardens and Kiyomasa’s 400 year old well where the water is crystal clear. Entrance to Shrine is free but gardens have a charge. Easily accessed by metro and JR lines. In summer it’s VERY hot and they do not sell water, bring your own."
234,So peaceful,"unique location, dark(ish) forest in the middle of busy city. very serene. simple yet stunning. there's a traditional ceremony when i was there. perfect"
235,Must See,Most likely the most impressive shrine in Tokyo. Worth a visit. Don’t forget to buy lucky amulets. They have some for any kind of occasion!
236,Good for Cultural Experience ,"Long distances to walk to the main shrine. Several entrances. Best to visit during weekends as normally there are traditional marriages, including procession."
237,"Lovely, peaceful setting","It was lovely, can’t deny that however it feels wrong to see them playing with the faith of others. For instance, tickets sold to pray for “safe child delivery”, “good marriage” and “improved health” ."
238,Greens!,"I enjoyed the spectacular nature paths covered with trees that led to the beautiful Meiji Jingu Shrine. The paths and shrine were not too crowded like other shrines. If you are looking for a nice hike outdoors mixed with a nice shrine without the crowds, this will be a great option!"
239,Perfect for an early morning activity,"The extensive grounds of this former Emperor's shrine are worth a visit themselves, with many strolling paths in well-kept grounds.  But the shrine itself is stunningly beautiful and revered by the population.  It is best to have some knowledge of the history of the Shrine and the background of Shinto to truly appreciate how important this is to the country and its people, but even without it, it is very impressive with its magnificent architecture and scale."
240,Peace in the City,"took the JR to Harajuku Station and walked to Meiji Jingu.  Stopped by the sake barrels for a good picture spot and on to the temple grounds.  Walked back to Harajuku station and went down Takeshita Dori/Street and then back to Omote Sando and the condom kiosk.  Then walked down from the station again to Shibuya Crossing and Hachiko Mae.  Good picture taking from the Starbucks there on the second floor.  Back on the JR from Shibuya station, very efficient way to see this part of Tokyo"
241,Lovely walk,"Beautiful and peaceful shrine. With a wonderful park to stroll in, souvenir shop and cafe available. Restful garden and interesting temple"
242,Serene area for a nice walk,We took the subway and then enjoyed the walk down a tree lined street with shops. Once we entered the shrine area it was very park like and peaceful. We witnessed two weddings and many people dressed for the occasion. The most peaceful part of the walk was the garden area.
243,Prepare for a good walk from subway station ,this is located just bang outside the station and is a very nice walk to the main shrine. There is also a orchid garden on the path which you have to pay to visit. we especially liked the walk to the shrine as it was laid with trees and old lanterns posts. we even caught a glimpse of a wedding procession
244,Beautiful,Impressive shrine  in a large garden. IT is the most important  Shinto shrine in Tokyo and also a place for the locals to enjoy a green lung in the busy city.
245,Very Scenic,"If you take a look at our pictures, you'll understand why. Been here before, and we're so glad we revisited when we did:)))"
246,Idyllic,"I went here in the evening towards the end of closing time. The walk in the ground was mesmerizing, esp with very few people around. I couldn't believe this exist in the middle of a bustling metropolis."
247,Interesting place ,"It's important to understand some of the customs when entering and leaving and good etiquette. They are simple, so good to take the time to find out. One of the largest temples in Tokyo and very well utilised. We visited in October so the weather was cool. Would have liked to stay a little longer."
248,"Beautiful, must-see",The family and I really enjoyed our visit here.The walk into the shrine was wonderful and once we arrived at the shrine enjoyed seeing it and the surrounding features. Well worth a visit.
249,Beautiful,Lots of historical importance.  Park around the temple was amazing and to think most of the trees were hand planted.  There were not too many people so we could enjoy the sites.  Fairly quick stop as we only needed about 30 - 40 minutes.
250,Incredibly peaceful ,Get to know more about the history of this temple and is worth a visit. The area is huge and ideal to stroll along and enjoy the beautiful ancient architectural structure while taking in the cool fresh air. I really enjoy my time here.
251,Top tourist destination,We visited unexpectedly after finding ourselves in the area. The gardens were lovely and we took a gentle walk through them to the shrine. It was a lovely calm break in  what is otherwise an extremely busy city. Perfect way to spend a relaxing few hours.
252,Completely and Utterly Captivating,"As recommended, we went on a Sunday and managed to see a wedding. It was truly lovely! The road leading to the shrine is full of little rocks so I would recommend avoiding heels. In all honesty, there wasn't much to see. The highlight of our trip was the wedding that we managed to catch."
253,Beautiful,"Amazing shrine! Located in shinjuku area, this shrine area is huge, a lot of big tree and you will forget that actually you are in the middle of busy area. From this shrine you can just walk to takeshita street."
254,A little bit of peace in the middle of one of the busiest cities in the world,"It's a bit of a trek in the rain from the parking lot. Nice shrine, big area but not any more impressive than any of the others we went to."
255,A quite palace in the city,"We were here right around 10 AM and it wasn't too crowded. We started our morning very early at the nearby park and spent a lot of time strolling around and watching the adorable dogs play in the dog park. After killing some time, we headed to Meiji Jingu and as I said, it wasn't too crowded around 10 AM. I'm sure it gets more crowded the later it gets. It's set in a very pretty area with a lot of trees surrounding it. Even though you're right in the middle of a city, it has a magic about it that feels quite secluded and almost like you're in the mountains."
256,A peaceful Sanctuary,Beautiful walkway towards the shrine and stunning forests. The shrine itself was impressive and we enjoyed watching several wedding parties come for photographs
257,Relaxing getaway ,We enjoyed the walk the the temple and then a look around. Good facilities (toilets) and lovely gardens
258,GOOD BASIS HALF DAY TOUR OF MEIJI JINGU PLUS,We were fortunate to visit with a guide who explained the washing ritual and other aspects of interest - then we were able to witness the procession of a wedding.  A beautiful place but also keep an eye open for the gates and the sake barrels which are beautiful in many ways.
259,Respite from Tokyo crowds ,Well worth a visit and thoroughly interesting. The shrine sits beside Yoyogi park and has free access. You can buy charms and amulets which make nice souvenirs as well.
260,Beautiful setting,"Such a pleasing experience! Although it was raining, the whole experience was still a great one. Went on a week day and was not crowded at all. Broad walking space so it's very family friendly. Not all venues in the shrine are accessible to public. Convenient access from Harajuku station."
261,One of the great sites in Tokyo,"Very beautiful shrine dedicated to the souls of the Emperor Shoken and Empress Shoken. It's a Shinto shrine, Japan's most ancient religion. Nice long walk to the main shrine and a nice garden with a picturesque lake. Entrance is free, except for the garden were they charge a small entrance fee for the upkeep of the garden."
262,A highlight of our trip,"i went here as a part of a day tour, and was surprised to find out that this was all man made forrests what started out as around 170,000 plants being planted is now well over 270,000 plants trees etc plus a whole heap of new plants that were never planted there in the first place. This is a easy place to move around in and disable friendly as well. I was lucky enough to be there when a blessing ceremony took place and it was really good to watch"
263,Hidden Gem near the city,"From the first bow at the massive ancient Torii Gate to ritual wash before entering the Temple, there is a sense of peace that pervades. Watched the local priest making ritual greetings to the newest novitiates before they went to the temple for prayers. Many people leaving messages of wishes, or prayer requests for the Shinto Priests to chant on the adjoining 'message walls'. Others consulted their fortune in other ways. Beautiful surrounding forest, belies it's close proximity to the city."
264,A Shinto shrine deep in the heart of Tokyo,"This shrine is beautiful and the courtyard is big.  We went early, early in the AM and got to witness their morning ceremonies.  It was a nice stroll to get to the temple through a wide forest trail.  It was so calming and peaceful to walk through woods.  This shrine has everything that Sensoji has, just on a smaller scale and no HUGE Lantern and scandals."
265,Bring your camera and get ready for a photoshoot,"We’d seen a lot of shrines by the time we visited. Pleasant as the Torri gates and buildings were, they’re not as impressive as Nikko for example, however the park and overall setting is a lovely recess from the hustle of the city. I’m not a Buddhist so can’t comment on the shrine from a religious perspective."
266,One of our favourite spots,We visited on a rainy Sunday and it wasn't crowded at all - but beware during high season. It was simply lovely and 2 min from Shibuya station.
267,Surprising oasis in central Tokyo,"Located next to the Yoyogi Park in the Harajuku district, really found this shrine and the surrounding area very relaxing, serene & calming. And to think that this is located in the middle of the bustling city area of Tokyo. This is one of those places that you have to visit if you are the type of person who likes & enjoy culture and history."
268,Natural discovery ,"The shrine is nearby the Harajuku street. You can come in the back and make your way to the front. So that you can continue to Harajuku Takeshita Street. There is a display of sake barrel on the way in to the shrine. There is a believe that only the spirit walk in the middle of the passageway and mortal walk on the sideways. One you reached the shrine, cleanse yourself before entering the shrine. You can throw a 5 yen and make a wish."
269,Beautiful,Nice walk through the forest to visit the shrine. Arrived thirty minutes before closing time which was enough time.
270,Large yet worth it,Beautiful place. As expected not for young children but brought them along anyway. Just didn’t spend a long time there.
271,City Hideaway,"We arrived at the park surrounding the shrine at about 8 am. We were so pleased that it was quiet and peaceful. We took a stroll through the lovely man-made forest until we reached the shrine. It was quite a humbling place to be, and I appreciated that there were signs in English explaining how to show respect and perform rituals correctly (for example, the hand washing). We also paid the 1000 yen per person to visit the inner garden, which includes a stroll around a lake. We did not see flowers because of the season.However, when we were leaving around 10:00, a steady stream of tourists was making their way through the park. I think our experience would have been very different if we arrived with them.Do yourself a favor and visit this shrine as early in the morning as possible. You may even see a Japanese couple taking wedding pictures, like we did!"
272,Historic and architecturally important ...,"Not as good as asakusa sensoji shrine. Went to sensoji thrice in a week instead. Theres not much to do, nothing much to see too."
273,Large beautiful shrine ,"Nice scenery around but there's nothing really special about this shrine, might be different during festivals though. Would love to see that."
274,Peace,From an entrance gate to the shrine took about 15 min. Be prepared to walk up slight inclines. The main center paths are lined with gravel. The side paths are concrete. The surrounding is serene and very historical. I really enjoyed how authentic the setting and architecture is. You can imagine how it feudal Japan was like in this surroundings.
275,Beautiful,"It was good 10-15 minutes walk from the subway. The shrine is surrounded by the forested park, it was really refreshing to explore around the park in the midst of the bustling city life. A good place to explore if you are into nature & culture."
276,Quiet nice area,Both the park and the shrine are quite impressive. Very nice flora around. Many locals attened this shrine as well.
277,Relatively new shrine,"In November, some autumn celebrations will be conducted. When I go there, just happened there is Autumn pray ceremony, every city contributed its selective production to the shrine, including wine and food. It’s good to understand their culture."
278,Another “Must Do” in Tokyo,Perfect for an early morning stroll before everything opens. The thick trees offer a bit of coolness in the summer humidity.
279,Nice Shinto Shrine,Definitely worth a visit. Takes about 2 hours to see everything. Very peaceful walk and the shrine was beautiful.
280,Calm and serene walk,"This is Tokyo’s most important shrine dating from 1920 and rebuilt after the Second World War. The large grounds are filled with huge cedar trees and it was a beautiful walk to the shrine. We were lucky to have warm, sunny weather and enjoyed walking through shade and sunny spots. The shrine comprises of many buildings around a large square. Photographs are not allowed at the beautiful temple itself as people are praying. Also you are not allowed to sit on the steps here. There are plenty of immaculate bathrooms and several cafes. When you leave the peace of the park it seems a surprise to be back on the busy streets of the upmarket shopping area nearby."
281,Beautiful,"my 18 y/o daughter and i spend a couple of hours here, and the grounds and shrine itself, along with the cafe area, were all lovely and peaceful. We even got to see a wedding procession while we were there. Please don't miss this lovely area.I would recommend that tourists keep in mind that this should be a place for quiet conversations only, and to be respectful in your photo taking etc."
282,Go on a Sunday!,Strolled thought the wooded paths to this lovely rebuilt shrine (originally early 20th C but rebuilt after the war).  Very peaceful place with some interesting features including barrels of both sake and Burgundy wine!  There happened to be a wedding on when we were there which was a highlight
283,Worth a visit,"We went there early in the morning while jet lagging.  It was a beautiful walk early in the morning, even in the rain!  The temple was beautiful and had a lovely assortment of bonsai, including one that was flowering when we were there.  The rest of the park was beautiful and we happened to be there during peak iris season and it was just gorgeous.As a note, the temple services (like goshuin) do not open until 9:00am."
284,Beautiful shrine surrounded by nature,"The Meiji Jingu Shrine and surrounding gardens is certainly worth a visit. Get  off at Harajuku  Train Station and walk around the corner to the entrance of the shrine. Great history of the shrine and to the Emperor Meiji. We attended on a Sunday and was honoured to watch a traditional Japanese wedding ceremony. Went for a walk in the surrounding gardens, pay 500 yen to go into gardens but for us we felt it was worth it. A very good experience for us."
285,Nice spot to visit,This park & shrine is well worth a visit.Only a 10-15 min walk from Shinjuku train station it’s hard to believe you are in a part of Tokyo city.The pathways are easy to walk around & well maintained.The shrine itself is an amazing piece of craftsmanship. Beautifully maintained & presented for all visitors to enjoy its splendour. The day we visited there was a display on.Plenty of surrounding cafes & restaurants to get a bite before or after a visit.Enjoy - this is relaxing place to go.
286,a must-see on any visit to Tokyo,"Of historical importance, ⛩ Shinto Shrine/Complex area is relatively peaceful, a stark contrast to the Harajuka streets right outside its main gates.Worth a visit but there is no “wow” factor here."
287,"Nice Range of Sights, Not just Temples",This is a huge park situated centre of Tokyo. Easily accessible by metro that just across the road opposite Main entrance. Interesting attractions to see along the walk to the Shrine nestled among huge old trees and other greenery. There is some attractions eg ponds etc has an entrance fee. Otherwise there is no entrance fee to this Shrine
288,Go early for less of a crowd,"A shrine dedicated to the spirits of Emperor Meiji & his consort, Empress Shoken.Before entering the Temple complex you are able to go thru a ritual wash process.Grounds house a Large Tori gate made from Japanese Cypress.Look out for the wooden Sake barrels.A wedding was taking place when we visited which was lovely."
289,Favorite place in Tokyo,5*Meiji ShrineShibuyaShinto shrine dedicated to Emperor Meiji (founder of modern industrialized Japan) and his wifeCan view very special ceremonies with Shinto priests in ceremonial room (tatami mats; no shoes allowed) – VERY COOL!Clean bathrooms in the ceremonial building
290,Beautiful green space in the heart of Tokyo,"Set in the midst of green cover provided by over 100,000 trees of varied species, the Meiji Jingu shrine is dedicated to the spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife Empress Shoken. One can spend a whole morning here and either relax in the cool environs of the park or just take long walks in the shade of this mini forest donated by the Japanese people to honour the memory of their beloved late monarchs. While we walked there from Yoyogi Park, one could take the train to Shibuya and walk from there too,"
291,In The Middle of An Enormous City?,"Set within a large spectacular park, the shrine is accessed via an avenue of towering trees, which offer pleasant shade from the sun.The whole place is very peaceful and it offers a nice contrast and break from the city, despite being located not far from the madness of the Shibu Crossing.It is free to access the surrounds of the shrine and up to visitors how much time they spend there.Worth a look..."
292,Beautiful and nice walk,"First of all, please remember that this is a religious place. So please show some respect and don't be one of the morrons who think it's ok to pose and dance for your latest insta, or shout and be loud...Very refreshing place when not overcrouded by tourists. Avoid the weekends ;)The forest around is huge, and the park just after is a nice place to relax."
293,First Step Into The Shinto Culture,I came here (for probably the 5th time overall) on a really wet and miserable day in November. It was terrible weather but off I went anyway. The walk from Harajuku station seemed longer than usual and definitely with less people but there is just something about that walk that transports you from the madness of downtown Tokyo to the serenity of Meiji Jingu.The buildings and grounds are really special...as is the massive collection of sake barrels that you pass on your way in...some of them are works of art!I was privileged enough to see a marriage ceremony going on too...it was lovely. I don't think anyone should go to Tokyo and not visit here!You can get here from JR Harajuku station or via Meiji-Jingu station on the metro. Easy!
294,Beautiful shrine & park,Lovely stroll to the Shrine sheltered by the dense trees along the pavement. You will also see wall of sake barrels as you walked further before reaching the Shrine.
295,Enchanted shrine of worship ,It is a peaceful walk to the shrine even is theres lots of tourist. Shrine itself it not spectacular to look at. If you are pushed for time its a long walk in and out.
296,A Walk in the Woods,"We were somewhat overwhelmed by the heat so were unable to enjoy this visit as fully as we would have liked. The group guide explained a lot of the various meaning and customs along the route including the purification process needed to enter the shrine itself. Most of our group did not go inside the shrine, but you were able to observe believers that entered the shrine for their blessing. Huge shade trees were present throughout the short walk leading back to the shrine."
297,Cool shrine,"It is one of the best decorative and historical places in Tokyo. Spacious garden, beauty of buildings, informative writings and its position in between Shinjuku and Shibuya are attractions of it. Early closing time is drawback."
298,Beautiful gardens,The Meiji Shrine is a Shinto shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of the great Emperor Meiji and the Empress Shoken. Its in the middle of Yoyogi Park.It’s a pretty impressive collection of buildings and enormous tori gates surrounded by a lush forest. It’s easy to forget that you’re in the middle of an enormous city for a little while!
299,must visit,"The shrine was built in 1920 and was dedicated to Emperor Meiji who ruled from 1852 to 1912.  During this period, Japan became a modern state.  The Shrine is surrounded by Yoyogi Park which was partially constructed for the 1964 Olympics.It's a short walk from the Harajuku station and you'll see the massive wooden torii gates. Many events take place at Meiji Shrine throughout the year.  If you happen to be there at the beginning of the year, there is a ceremony dedicated to sumo wrestling which takes place during the first week of January.  You will see the sumo wrestlers receiving purification.  You can probably see it on TV but if you are there at the time, you may see the Yokozuna up close.We have seen wedding preparations and actual weddings at the shrine.  We’ve also seen visits by ambassadors from foreign countries.  US Presidents and foreign dignitaries all come to this shrine.  It’s definitely something you should see."
