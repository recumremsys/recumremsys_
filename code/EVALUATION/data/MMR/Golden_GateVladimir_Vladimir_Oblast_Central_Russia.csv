0,Vladimirâ€™s old gate,"From the 5 gates from the fortress city, the golden gate is the only one which remains. Today as part of a roundabout."
1,has a history,It is 12th century remain of the great wall of Vladimir. It was once the main entrance as a fancy gate to the city.No glamor is presered.The walls are gone and a church golden dome was addeded. It serves as a museum history of Vladimir. Just nearby on the hill stands the water tower built a century ago and it exhibits the old Vladimir as well. Then combine these sites and the high platforn of this hill (or even the higher platform of the tower) for an observation point.
2,Interesting place for a short visit ,"The Golden Gate is an interesting landmark from the outside and houses some very interesting historical artifacts. There is a lot of information to be found inside and is definitely a must for a tourist in Vladimir. Beware of the stairs, there are quite a lot. Probably too much for an elderly person but very manageable for the majority of adults and younger people."
3,City gate,"I visited the Golden Gate in Vladimir, which is an example of Russian military architecture of the 12th century, with a tour guide to explain the details and sketch the historic background. In the past, it served as the main entrance to the city from Kiev. Nowadays, the Golden Gate indicates the centre of Vladimir. This UNESCO Heritage Site is well worth a visit."
4,Very Interesting museum,"The Golden Gate and the museum are very much worth visiting. The museum focuses on the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. See more here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate,_Vladimir. I loved seeing the Gate and the city of Vladimir."
5,Important monument,"It's important to realize that this museum is located in what used to be a fortress gate on the road to Moscow.  Strangely, many of the exhibits are focused on World War 1 and 2.  The diorama is neat and if you know how to ask politely there is an English soundtrack available."
6,Important site,The beautiful gates is located in the middle of Vladimir.  You won't miss the historical site when you pass the city center.  Recommend you to have a photo stop there even if you have no interest on the displays in the museum.
7,"Very ancient, full of history",The impressive gateway is on the main street in the middle if Vladimir. Check it out as you walk or drive past to other sites.Some reviews mention q display upside but we didn't stop to go in.
8,Historical site in Vladimir,"A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it decorates the city and gives a majestic appearance. You can feel history flowing through it..."
9,Look on the way past,In the middle of the road you have to pass through it. It was the main entrance to the city in olden days and an UNESCO world heritage site.
10,It reminded me of the old gates in Harar Ethiopia,"This is located right in the Main Street and is nice for a photo stop. Unless one is interested in military display/history, wouldn't recommend this as a must do."
11,On the main road,a must see in vladimir. rich history of the area. good place for photo. but I learnt more from our tour guide.
12,Interest Site,"The best way to visit this great gate is along with a guide or after having read its history, since it has suffered many changes in time since it was built, so without understanding them, the visit will be practically meaningless."
13,Historical monument in main street,This is also easy to get to.  It is quite impressive.  We didn't visit he museum inside maybe if we have time later in our visit
14,Most interesting site in Vladimir ,"As far as I know, this is the only remaining gate to the city that is still standing. Oddly enough, it is still a gate of sorts, as it stands in the middle of a traffic circle."
15,Interesting for the military enthusiast,My wife and I visited the museum and for me it was the most interesting of all the places we visited in Vladimir.   The model of the attack from the Mongol/Tartar's in 1238 was especially interesting - they will play an audio in English or Russian that is very well done so ask them about it if they don't offer it.  Very nominal fee for entry.
16,Very Interesting Historical Exhibits,Fantastic spot to take photos. Not recommended for people with health problems. Can't remeber if their was a lift
17,Best place for photos,"Didn't really go out of our way to get here as if you are walking down the main road you will come across the golden gates. It helps to know a little if the history to make your time worthwhile,  otherwise you will just be admiring an interesting game arch and building. So stay on the main road and  you can't miss this site."
