0,Pretty,Really loved the beach here but we went when it was windy so umbrellas were flying everywhere and the sea was too choppy to go in as the waves were too high. We found a lovely cafe near the beach and the staff running our hotels section were really nice. We also bought watermelon for £5 off a man on the beach
1,Relaxed experience,"Beautiful beach with a lot of activities, I went during January but the weather was pleasant for walking and jogging - they have fountains around and nice coffee shops ... beautiful laid highly recommend this place while in Alanya"
2,"Beautiful beach, clear water 💦","We loved to visit Kleopatra Beach. We were there in march, it was warm and lovely and almost had the place for ourself."
3,Best beach ever!,This beach has very nice potential but the sea was very dirty when we visited. The were chicken bones swimming on the surface and some more waste swimming along. People around the beach pointed the visiting tour boats disposing their waste to the sea. It will be great if municipality addresses this issue.
4,Beautiful!,"We really loved this beach. Beautiful mountains, sunsest and waves. It can be a little bit difficult to get in and out the water though, because of the waves. The water fastly gets deeper also. But the water is refreshing, not too cold, and the beach is wonderfully. Very clean and a lot of places to get drinks and cocktails. We loved it here."
5,The most beautiful beach,We really enjoyed the stay on that beach. The sea was clean and trasnparent but the beach is not with sand.
6,Nice beach ,"The scenaries are amazing but the sea had lots of sea weed and the wave were really rough, it's not easy to get in and out of the sea , I have bruises on my legs from the waves tossing me around and on the stony beach"
7,Perfect,"Nice clean beach, When we went water very choppy but kids enjoyed it. Little pebbles mixed with sand."
8,Holiday ,"Lots said how lovely this beach is. It truly is. Soft sand. The sea is clear and was still really warm in september. We used beach 10 and 11 but all looked lovely. Sunbeds were very reasonably, but fine to just put towels down on the sand. Even though busy,it was quiet and serene.very relaxing. Definitely recommend"
9,Alanya,"Beautiful scenery all round. The beach is stunning, the sea was easy to get in and out of. We did a bit of snorkelling which wasnt brilliant but ok. Food and drink was reasonably priced. We were at no 14 beach location and the guys which serviced that bit of beach were friendly and funny, do try out their beach bar/cafe the food was good."
10,Stones,"Very nice beach with lovely clear water and wasn’t over crowded, but we went there about 4pm.Ended the day trip to Alanya with a lovely swim in warm water"
11,It’s a must,This is a beautiful place too visit.The sand is golden and we went at a nice time and got to walk along the beach. Think it's the best ever beach I've ever been too
12,Love it.,"Huge waves, not able to come out of water, one day it was very dirty and horrible No more sand inside, some huge rock is now inside and it is deep! The moment you walk in water you're in deep! It's okay, bit it's not very safe for children, red flag is always up, I hope next year or soon, it will get better. But still nice comfortable sunbeds, and nice place to enjoy"
13,Superb Beach,Stayed Alanya in October. Weather still over 30 c.Went beach every afternoon. We chose beach 3 because it was closest to hotel.Didnt bother renting a sun lounger .Just put a towel on the sand. You can get right down to the sea with a towel.Sun beds are set well back.Great location. Very clean.Just a warning as you get into the water for about 10 foot sea has smooth very slippery rocks.If your not expecting it you will take a fall.Once you clear the rocks it goes deep quickly. Same problem getting out very slippery. But its a great beach. Highly recommended. We spent every afternoon at kleopatra beach.
14,Sandy toes ,My stay in Alanya was great and the beach was right next to my hotel so that was good aswel. But people understand very little English which kinda sucks tbh..
15,Beautiful ,"We loved this beach, great waves plenty of beds, gorgeous fresh juices and corn on the cob lovely restaurants around it"
16,Great beach ,"Excellent beach, gorgeous sunsets. Really well kept and clean. Visited in December and water temperatures were lovely and not at all crowded. Would like to go back when not working to really enjoy it."
17,"Good beach, but very crowdy","Stayed at Grand Okan, and used there beach area quite a lot, lovely beach plenty of loungers and umbrellas 30tl per day, well maintained and excellent bar service.Water was warm and plenty of people in just bobbing about plenty of waves.My husband who is not a sea person once in could not get him outToilets close at hand 2tl, spotlessCertainly best beach I have been on in turkey"
18,Great beach ,The beach and the guys on beach nr 22 made our holiday perfect 😊 They are so nice and friendly that it is nice to be a visitor there. We will come back
19,Very nice beach,"clean ,beautiful golden coarse sand and water,not so many people around,the waves are high because of going by ships and boats,beautiful green area around with umbrellas and sun loungers.beautiful green area around with restaurant ."
20,Beautiful beach with castle views,"Very communal feel from all the cafès along the beach and the people around, the sea is clear when you swim a bit further out but near the shore it has a fair amount of sea weed and can be quite wavey, it provides a great view of the castle and has a migros (supermarket) very close by (2-3 mins walk)"
21,Golden beach,The beach itself is lovely however the waves can be quite big and the pull is very strong. Wouldn't recommend going into the sea but the scenary is beautiful. The beach is split into sections and you have people that show you sun loungers and will bring you drinks/snacks etc and then you pay when you leave (for 3 beds it was 40 lira)
22,Nice place ,"The beach could be little bit cleaner, but water was very warm and we spent very good time in here :)"
23,Nice,"It's always nice to be in the beach, but beware, it gets fast deep and high waves almost always And it was not clean."
24,Wonderful beach! ,Nice Beach and the water was Nice. There is a Nice playground and you Can but soda and beers in the bar nearby. We also played beachvolley on one of the 3 courts. We gave 20 Lira for one hour.
25,One of the best beaches i have ever been ,"We visited this beach in June 2011.  It was a pleasant beach.  The sand was actually tiny pebbles, so the normal mess you get with sand was non existent.  The water was a lovely deep blue colour.  We found it very relaxing here.  The only downside was that the water goes deep quite close to shore.  So you need to be a little cautious with young children.  All in all a good experience.  Would recommend this beach as a family friendly space."
26,Quiet Winter Beach,"Nice beach,but crowded in july. Some of the beach numbers you can find free sunbeds, some you need to pay."
27,Nice beach,Love this beach not rocky lovely clear blue sea sometimes can have rather large waves price for sun beds and parasols not bad at all
28,Gorgeous Beach,"The beach is lovely and easy to get to, lots of sunbeds available, sea is also warm and the waves are great"
29,Great beach ,Big and nice sandy beach. Very clean beach and the water is amazing and hot. There may be some waves and you should allways be careful in the water.
30,The best ,In comparison to the other beach in Alanya I would definitely stay here and we did. The party boats are mainly in harbour so this beach is kind of less mess and fuss.
31,No sand ,We loved this beach as it was part of Cooks Corner hotel so the access to it was easy. Lots to see while you are lay on your sun bed. At one point seven ships must of been on the water. Paragliding going on above . Lots of families out for the day This beach had a lovely relaxed atmosphere and no lucky lucky men are allowed so you can relax in peace This beach is perfect to watch the sunset
32,Very nice beach,"Lovely sandy beach which at times can make you think your back in the 16th Century because looking out across the ocean the horizon is full of Galleons.Extremely long with café/bars strewn along the shoreline we stopped at Bar 18 which was very good, moderately priced with good service.The beach is extremely popular an therefore busy with the busiest part starting close to the mountain that houses Alanya Castle but the further along the coast you go the less people on the beach, the same applies to parking, on the road opposite you can park for free but the further along you go the easier you will fin the parking.A multitude of shops, cafés, hotels and souvenir establishments are located opposite the beach.The promenade in front of the beach hosts a multitude of places to get a cold drink or snack and a number of small parks where you can sit in the sun or the shade.  On the opposite side of the road you will find vendors selling Camel rides, not for us but we did pay the owner a few pounds to have our picture taken with them."
33,Kleopatra beach 22,"If you like warm temperature, sand and sun - you should try Cleopatra Beach in Alanya! Nice waves  and very nice temperature in the sea! And many  exciting restaurants serving good lunches."
34,Nice beach,Lovely beach stretching for about a mile with lovely beach cafes.Not good for small children as the sea goes deep straight away with big waves
35,Nice sandy beach,What a beautiful beach to visit. The sea is lovely and warm and just a great beach. If your in alanya you have to go.
36,Very beautiful beach,"Love this beach!!! Been here so many times, only problem is there’s lots of pebbles, and you can’t really walk with out something on your feet But a really nice and relaxing"
37,Stunning sunsets,"It was a peacfull, clean and beautiful beach where you can sit down for hours and watch the waves. You can get drinks , snaks and whatever you like from shops near the beach. You can take your dog for a walk or enjoy a long run close to the beach"
38,Beach,"The beach was near our hotel and it is located near varied shops.  It is a wonderful place for different activities, many restaurants and so on."
39,FANTASTIC BEACH,"Most beautiful beach with golden fine sand, a pleasure to walk without shoes, only just with feet. That's it."
40,Nice,We go beach 3 by cable car.Love it.Sunbeds available but we just take towel.Lovely warm water.Nice beer bar.Good prices
41,"It was ok, but big stones under the sea.","Really good beach, water warm and clean. Here is nice,not noice, you can bay water, eat and you can go to look castle."
42,Clean,A very nice beach the water isn't very cold when you go in only a bit. Its just got a big rock as you go in. You after pay for you're sunbeds and umbrellas. The sand is not that sticky it comes of fairly quickly when it dry's
43,beautiful beach,"It's a long small pebbles beach , were you can rent long chairs and unbrellas , cafes are spread all along the beach , overall it's a clean and safe place."
44,Beautiful surroundings!,Kinda good and sand was perfect. And I recommend you to go in morning 'cause water is perfect at that time.
45,Stunning beach,Big beach with beautiful sand and beach chairs for rent. Restaurants nearby. Good warm water but be aware the waves can be very big. I managed to lose my swim trunks while getting knocked over by a big wave.
46,A perfect beach for everybody,Good clean beach and low price sunbeds to rent. There are some rocks as you enter the water so I would recommend some suitable foot wear.
47,Clean sandy soft ,Really beautiful place. Nice beach and Good place to take Sun and swimmimg. Many good food places around.Beautiful
48,Nice beach with huge waves,Really good sandy beach with blue water and sometimes very high waves. Beach is parted on beach bars which is renting sun beds and umbrellas. Usual price for 2 sun beds and umbrella is 15-25 TL.
49,Just lovely,"This is s great beach, very clean sandy beach, clear blue water, good place to swim.  Not great for practising Muslims"
50,Fantastic,Cleopatra beach has everything. the sand is nice and water clean and nice temperature. there is a lot of possibilities and activities. Nice restaurants and cool beach clubs
51,Great beach,Great beach but very grainy sand but apart from that it’s great lovely little park next to beach front and lovely aqua water
52,Very joyfol,"Such a beautiful long beach, Amazing surroundings, fun waves, Cheap sunbeds and umbrellas and has all the necessary facilities, although I didn't see any life guards on the coast, I did see rescue boats. You won't feel like swimming in any other beach in Alanya after you swim in Cleopatra beach."
53,Really nice beach,Brilliant Lovely place to visit.  The weather was hot hot so you need a sun brolly Bring water shoes to protect your feet The sea was lovely and warm.
54,Beautiful location,"the beach here is gorgeous but beware as you walk into the sea as there are shelves of sand then deep then shallow again. parts of this beach can get quite rough waves, but for me it just added to the enjoyment of the sea. sit close to a bar if you want waiter service. 30 Turkish lira for 2 sunbed and 1 umbrella."
55,Was busy but ok,nice beach but lots of small stones at waters edge need crocs or shoes to wear into the water as its quite painful on your feet otherwise.
56,Beautiful beach ,"There is good sea on Kleopatra Beach. Not good for children, because it is deeply in two steps. Be attention, there is shark rocks! You can go to Šatal kale (castle), it is very nice and cheap by taxi."
57,kleopatra beach,I was there with my family.  It’s very good and beautiful place for holiday.  It was clean and very good
58,Summer vacation,"Whilst staying in Alanya we visited this beach everyday without fail. The Beach is clean and tidy with sun loungers to rent for a cheap price that you can keep all day and there are many drink and food options to choose from. There are lots of showers and toilets which is very convenient. The views from the beach are picturesque of the mountains, cable cars and castle and the sea water is warm and crystal clear. The most beautiful beach ever and a must if you visit Alanya!"
59,Kleopatra Beach,The Kleopatra Beach is a very nice sand beach with a very bright blue sea! You can eat and drink in a lot of beach terraces with sun beds and relax beds. It's also clean all over the beach. A beautiful beach near the centre of Alanya.
60,Beautiful beach,Stunning beach and plenty to do if you like keeping yourselfs fit.Next to the beach you have excersise machines and there is a play area for children.There is a beautiful area to sit and relax with fountains and beutifull gardens.There are places you can sit and have a drink or something to eat.There also is a cable car that you can go up to the castle and see some stunning views.
61,Wonderful place,"Visited this stunning beach a few days ago and it was lovely, one of the cleanest beaches I’ve been on! The sea was a nice temperature and I’d highly recommend a day on the beach as lots of bars and restaurants close by!"
62,Superb beach,Fabulous waters and beach. Some great bars. Beach 15 with Charlie who looked after us all day is great
63,Wee break,"It is the most beautiful beach of Alany. It can be very busy here as well, but it is still a very nice place to go for a swim."
64,Beach visit ,"Many nice eating places, so they deserve a visit, but the beach itselves, had a lot of big chunks of chewing gum, beer bottle caps(those you pull off, with very sharp edges), sigarett butts, and other garbage...not very inviting"
65,Good,"Beautiful, very long and clean beach. the sea temperature in August was about 28 degrees. You have to pay for loungers (5 Euro per day approximately). Very nice place."
66,Beaches ,Beautiful beach with castle views . Crystal clear waters with great surf waves. Watch the pirate boats come round into the bay.
67,Beautiful beach,"Hot sand. Remember shoes. Beautiful water. Soft sand in the water. My daughter and I rented two sun chair. We Lay at nr 16. Super service and there is toilet and a place to wash sea salt of your body. You can buy icecreame, Coffee, soft drinks. And if you stay at Kleopatra beach hotel you have free wifi. Not the fastest one."
68,Super sweet,"2 times a day we went to this beach. In the morning and in the late afternoon. The waves were sometimes very big, but I was also very fun. Swimming is possible along the beach. I did 1,2 km one day. Facilities are very fine with cheap sun beds and umbrellas. Always easy to buy drinks and food. Many areas with showers."
69,Kleopatra Beach,Beautiful white sand and clean. Near beach there are so many restaurants and bars. Childers park just near beach and there so many rides for them.
70,Nice beach,Perfect beach for holiday. It was the best part of my holiday. Had a great time. Alanya is amazing place. The right place for holiday
71,Cleopatra beach ,Nice beach but to much big stones under water. Tried one time just for swim and go back :D So could be better.
72,Great place,"The water was nice and warm and the sand was a lovely light golden close to white and the water was a variation between a nice blue green and turquoise, its also shallow most of the way out to the buoys so its great all around. There are so many bars and restuarants located along the beach you have a lovely selection of eateries very close by."
73,Best location ,"Kleopatra beach is one of the most wonderful beach I saw in my life ..the sand was beautiful,water is not cold, there are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas, toilets,bars...cannot wait to come back!"
74,"Done it, did it... Not doing it again.",This place is stunning. Fabulous water. Lots of bars and cafes always something going on and views of the castle and passing boats
75,Almost dangerous place to go swimming,"Beautiful beach, lot of people but there is a never problem with sun beds. Beach is clean, just one problem are cigarettes on sand"
76,lovely beach,"The beach is a nice place to stay. White warm sand and possibility to buy parasol. But!!! The most places are full av hard big uneven stones that skratch your while body if you fall. The waves arr usually så intense that it’s diffucult to go swimming withour harming yourselv. I’ve been there with my mother and family. My mother could not go swimming at all, neither could a little one. Not a good place for elderly people or for small children."
77,clean beach,"Very nice beach and even free wifi!Not so good for kids as the water gets quite deep instantly, but apart from this a very nice beach. I came there every day during my stay."
78,Just WOW! ,The beach is nice. Long. You have the dalmati cave close. The water is cristal clear. Worth a visit!
79,Bright and clean,The sea season just started. Clean and nice beach for swim. There is lot of restaurant and cafes near the beach.
80,History and nature together!,"Beach has stunning views, beach not sandy, gritty.worth paying at hotel for sunbeds and umbrella,as cheaper than on beach.Be aware strong current, not ideal for children or non swimmers, take swim shoes as pebbles going in, great for sun bathers"
81,Historic,Visited this beach on the 3rd of June at around 2pm and couldn’t find a single sun bed or even a little space to sit down as it was so overcrowded! Only way to get a spot here is to come as early as possible or book your spot via your hotel. Apart from that the beach and it’s surroundings are absolutely beautiful and it has some real nice bars and restaurants. If your visiting or staying in the area of Alanya then visiting Kleopatra beach is a must but do remember to try arriving as early as possible to avoid any disappointments.
82,amazing beach,lovley day out at Cleopatra beach..my young kids an teenage ones they loved every moment of it..Beach was very clean.
83,Highly recommended,"Such a beautiful little beach and very well kept, clean and tidy 💗 they also have lilos which can be rented for a small fee 👌🏽 plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas to! Most definitely the best beach I have seen in turkey itself 💗"
84,Not so great,"Lovely clean beach, quite peaceful even though its a busy one. You can have a bed and umbrella for a reasonable price. There is a beach on the other side of the castle where you can get an umbrella and bed for free but it is not so clean."
85,Decent,"The best beach in Alanya. The infrastructure is good, close to the everything, nice sand. A lot of entertainment offers"
86,Good enough,It's one of the best if not the best beach in Alanya. Beautiful to swim in the clear water. I'd say it's a must to go to.
87,Mediocre ,"I loved everything about this wonderful place : the landscape consisting of green mountains that surround all Alanya, the palms which gave the exotic vibe, the Teleferik lifting people to castle just by the side of the beach. Being in the salty warm water made me feel as if I'm not only having the best holiday but also having a little therapeutic session because I could hear my neck and joints cracking. The sunbeds and umbrellas are a must because the sand is as hot as lava especially in the middle of the day. There are showers and changing cabins, toilets and bars so that every wish is catered. Probably one of the best beaches there are."
88,One of the best beaches ever,"The end of the beach towards the castle has better sand! There’s even a cat park next to it for the cat lovers like me hahah. The water is so beautiful and clean, I preferred this beach more compared to the beach in belek which had so many stones :( and just wasn’t as pleasant. There is a lot of people and it’s crowded but that’s holiday season for u!"
89,☆ Perfect ☆ ,"Its a very nice beach,  and if you are from One of the Sunpark hotels you get a good and cheep service on the beach so you dont have to go up everytime you need something to drink or eat. And you dont need to go far if you want to rent a jetski or try sitting in a bathing ring being pullt by a speedboat."
90,Nr 22,"Amazing beach and huge, loads of sand very little rocks, apparently the council removed sharp rock formations and replaced it with smooth marine concrete. This makes great footing when walking into the sea. The sands drop very quickly so one one minute your ankle deep then your waist deep. Water was clean clear and no seaweed or debris. Sand is great for building castles, even if your an adult."
91,Hide-and-seek ,The best part of my trip was enjoying beach and wonderful clean water the weather was amazing and if you are planning to visit Antalya don’t forget to enjoy it ‘s awesome beaches
92,This year not so great,"Amazing experience, the water was warm and the waves were a great experience.Be careful as a part of the beach has solid rock platform right at the entry level and you need to find the right place to get in the water.Super clean water and you can see through without binoculars."
93,Best Beach in Alanya,Peaceful surroundings this time of year still hot and sunny and I like to go beginning of Nov no kids around
94,Holiday beach no. 15,The best beach in alanyha loved it spent the day here picturesque views and water sports array of shops and beach restaurants would definitely recommend
95,great sand beach,Amazing beach and great for swimming.  They have many facilities and restaurants on the beach. You can play beach volleyball or go on a boat trip. A very nice beach in Alanya.
96,Kleopatra Beach,"The beach is beautiful, you can see the castle from the beach. The water is nice. The beach is made from small stones which get everywhere, but it is very nice and beautiful there."
97,Great beach with stunning scenery,"Amazing view both ways, just loving the sunset in there and lights from castle at the night time. Also really clean place, have to respect how they can keep it that clean even visitors leaves all thrash there!"
98,"Hotellopphold, frokost, basseng",A lovely clean beach with crystal clear water. The sunbed and umberella hire are affordable. They are all at good social distancing.
99,Cleopatra beach,You will definitely love it. I have been to many beaches in Turkey but this beach is my favorite since 1993.
100,Gets packed,Visited the beach every day for a week - always clean and tidy but sea was abit rough in occasion. Easily accessed and made easier by the numbers on the prom
101,Pretty standard,"Very nice beach, having everything, by nature and provided by people, for the visitors to feel and accommodate great."
102,Water,There is no sand on this beach and you need to pay for sun beds. Was terrible for children I'd never return. Very busy also.
103,Beautiful beach,"Nice peaceful place that beach area, very beautiful place and long beach, many kilometres long. Often there is much wawes. On the beach there is flags, different colors, when you see is it possible to swim. Next to beach is beach bulevard street, where you can walk and take pictures with nice statues."
104,Sandy Beaches ,Make sure to go at beach no.1 because the water there is more clear than at the other beaches. It gets deeps soon so watch out. Other than that one of the cleanest beaches Ive been
105,Nice beach ,"We used beach number 16, guys were very good but I did notice that the beach bar and cafe would bring the food in from a local take away when people ordered food. Beach itself was lovely. Sand gets very hot, enough to give you blisters on your feet."
106,Rough sea,"I've been to this beach as the hotel i've stayed at for the past 2 years when travelling was right on the beach. Its so beautiful, the sea is so clear, the sands are beautiful and golden and the view of the castle and sunset from the beach are just breathtaking. I will be returning to Alanya for the 3rd year in a row this year and i guarantee most of my time will be spend relaxing on this gorgeous beach, There are small charges to rent sunbeds etc but it is nothing to say you get the beds from paying until the end of your stay that day."
107,Great beach,Great beach great service if you want it yes there is some stones os you enter the sea but not a problem
108,"Nice, pleasant, very hot sand beware","This beach was ok , nice views only problem we had , was because of the 2020 covid 19 situation,  there wasn't a lot of social distancing,  water shelved quite a lot not great for non swimmers"
109,Clean beach ,Very beautiful and clean sandy beach. I had a good time with good food and drinks. Def. come back again.
110,Great day out  ,"Lovely beach, sunbeds and umbrella reasonably priced.  Great views of the Castle and the ships passing.  Great facilities, play areas for the kids and cafe's and toilet facilities."
111,Beach 12 Cleopatra Beach,"stayed at the riviera hotel, perfect spot..close to everything and beautiful kleopatra beach a stones throw away"
112,Lovely beach,Nice enough beach...rent sun lounges and umbrellas from hotel you staying in as its cheaper.table service is available but you are gonna have to tip but at £1-2 a day its worth not having to go to the bar.
113,Love this Beach,"Fantastic Beach ,golden sands, gradual incline to sea. lots of bars on the beach. Charge for sun beds 10 Turkish Lira."
114,Beautifull beach,"stunning beach but very hot sand make sure you have good foot ware,right next to shops and restraints and cable car to the top of the mountain very good price with fantastic views"
115,Great beach near the city,Nice beach with plenty restaurants and shops around. You can seat on the beach or restaurant and admire beautiful views. It is close to city centre walking distance.
116,Beautiful beach,"best beach in alanya , only down side is water gets deep quick so stay near the beach if your not a good swimmer"
117,Family summer break ,It is the best beach in Alanya. It is quite long and you can choose would you like to closer to city centre or further. In my opinion beach part closer to city centre is nicer but more crowded...also an advice 2 sunbeds and umbrella is 18TL closer to city centre...but some place ask 30 TL...so walk a bit around and you can save some money for fresh orange juice which could be found on the walking area.
118,Beautiful!!,"Cleopatra is not only a blue flag beach and has it amazing sand and view,but it the beach where history were writen on sand .the Queen of Egypt Cleopatra and her love Anthony where coning to this beach by the bug flot of ships to enjoy this beach and the view.As much As Queen cleopatra loved this place Anthony named as on her name as A gift of His love to Cleopatra and her where the name comes:Cleopatra beach where all love can start."
119,Very nice beach,"Very nice beach with alot of watersports. Parachuting, bananaboat and so on. Good food and very nice staff. Especially on ""beach 14"". But extremely hot in the sand so beachshoes is highly recomended. Also for going into the water. No fine sand and Big rocks when going into the water"
120,Best Beach.,Great beach and large enough to find a quiet spot. Sand very hot so would recommend beach shoes. Mainly sand but there are some pebbles. Very to food outlets etc
121,Stunning,Lovely and clean beach. Sea can be rough. Not recommend swimming in the sea if not a string swimmer.
122,Great beach,"Water was rough for are 2 weeks, coarse sand unless you go past beach 19, there is a shelf of stones and shingle as you go in which is difficult and dangerous getting out. A man died while we were there! They had padding pools for kids !"
123,Lovely get away,The beach is sandy and long but very busy in season and the sand stops at the waterline revealing a slippery rock reef that has to be crossed to get into swimming depths. Our party thought that this indicated that the beach sand had been dumped there - not sure. Alanya is all a bit 'bucket and spade' and Kleopatra beach typifies this. It is immediately backed by a big road (Alanya old road) for most of its length with the tourist shops and old hotels on the other - much like 'Blackpool in Turkey'!
124,Lovely clean beach!,"Very nice place, beach, sea with clear water, cave, mountain, ships on the horizon, restaurant and bars"
125,Beach n:o 1 is the best,"Great views and very clean water. I think the best spot is Alaaddin Beach .. the beds are comfortable and cheapest on the beach and of you're eating of drinking then they are free. Not to mention you can charge your phone and rinse off from a nice beach shower.  It's the part of the beach where the beds are yellow.  The Beach Boys there that will look after you are Sado and Serkan. Great guys, that really enjoy their jobs and taking care of guests.  It's an excellent walking beach as well. Enjoy your holiday"
126,Nice beach,Beach is best sandy beach in Alanya however it was very dirty. Cigarette butts and garbage many places. Too many russians..sorry. We visit every year but I think Cleopatra beach is no longer on our list. Alanya city should clean up beaches.
127,The beach is very good,Absolutely stunning beach kept really clean . Lots of stuff to do there is a park for the kids also ping bong tables in the garden part near the kelopatra statue.
128,Beautiful island,"This beach is a blue flag beach, really nice and family friendly, a really good walk from one end to the other( only if you are reasonably fit) the views are great especially the end by the castle and cable car"
129,Beautiful and quiet beach,"Well I came here as a friend recommended it and honestly, loved every second of it! As it was back end of the season, things were so calm and serene almost. The beach was spotless and the people sooo friendly. I booked a 5 star hotel miles away and honestly, if I could swap hotels to any on this strip I would do so in a heartbeat. So much more happening around it. You can hire a lounger for 10 lira and the staff around the beach are very friendly. There’s children’s play areas, gardens, exercise equipment all around it. Many of the 5 star large complexes could learn a lot from Kleopatra Beach!"
130,Beautiful ,"Nice beach with nice sand, well equipped with showers and changing cabins. To my mind is too crowdy due to popularity."
131,Beautiful wide beach,"We stayed at a hotel on the Kleopatra beach, so it was fine. The beach is quite clean, but there are bigger rocks in the water, which is not so clean every time. So it is okay, in Turkey, this is a really nice beach, but if you love the beaches in Greece, it will be completely different."
132,Stunning!!!,Here on a family break. While the hotel is great we sprnd more time on this fantastic beach. The hotel has its own section and the guys on there look after you. No lucky luck men and any inconsolable people are asked to leave. Gorgeous course grit sand and loads of space
133,Stunning,"Beautiful sandy beach with beautiful surroundings and the view of open sea, just beware of big waves when coming out of the sea, the rocks are slippery, I almost broke my toe as I got slammed by waves onto the rocks underneath."
134,Beautiful wide golden beach,First time we spend on this beach we normally use to be at Damlatas beach or as the new name Palm beach. We really enjoyed this beach easy for children and older people to get in and out to the water. Wonderful sand and great people who worked food was good and service wonderful 🌞🌞🌞. We really recommend this beach we will for sure come back next time .
135,Just breathtaking,"Good beach ,grain type sand ,steep water front access to sea water. Long beach with many things to see and do on it."
136,Mr Reg Roberts ,"Nice, wide and long beach with very small gravel and sand. The water is extremely clear. Huge, flat rocks along the shore in the water, slippery but you don't have to step on them, just swim. Wonderful place for young kids. Showers with sweet water at every entrance."
137,BEST BEACH TO VISIT AT ALANYA,"Blue sky, turquoise color ocean. It is a beautiful beach you can enjoy the sun, swimming and cool cocktail."
138,"Very nice place, good wiew!","Beautiful beach gets very crowded but well worth it, it's a must there are shops and cave you can visit don't bother wasting your money."
139,Perfect,"The beach was a nice spot to catch the sun. We paid around 20 lira a day to hire a couple of sun loungers from a lovely chap called Hassan. He would stop by every now and again asking if we needed any drinks or some shade which was nice. The beach itself is extremely crowded and you can almost always hear somebody’s music blaring from somewhere so it wasn’t the most relaxing beach I’ve ever been to! The sand gets unbelievably hot in the middle of the day so be aware of this. The sea is stunning here. Cristal clear and so warm! Some days it was beautifully calm and flat and others it was huge, crashing waves which made for a lot of fun. Take inflatables to the beach, it’s fun! Parking near by and easily accessible."
140,Beautiful location ,A long sandy beach with a great service and excellent Turkish coffee. The staff in cafés is really nice and kind as well.
141,nice beach ,"Wonderful beach!  Clear, refreshing water, spectacular view, waves not too big, sand ranges from fine to course to literally bigger pebbles (closer to the mountain).  Did some snorkeling, not much to see for underwater adventures! Walked up and down this beach enjoying the perfect temperature water and sunshine.  Also walked the sidewalk near the beach. Both are awesome.  During the day there are beach volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts and of course nearer the mountain the gondola taking you up to the Castle!  When laying on the beach enjoying the sun, a wonderful breeze carries off the water making tanning enjoyable (I do not particularly like just laying in the sun - but the breeze was fantastic making it very relaxing, just make sure to wear sunscreen and have a timer so you don't burn!  I literally dozed off it was so relaxing). The mountains on either side frame the ocean view, with Gulets (ships) of all sizes travelling through the bay regularly that are quite interesting in their design. I've been to beaches in Dominican, Mexico, Belize, and this ranks as one of the best in my opinion!"
142,beautiful,Who want to be in White sand beautiful sıra blue sea that must be there in kleopatra beach and you can stay with good Turkish massage
143,best alanya beach,Best beach best location and good street very clean sea and so beautiful hotel there love it best for the holiday go and have good time
144,Best beach I've seen,"... But not the nicest around the coast.If you go in the middle there are stones when you are entering the water and on stones are algaes so it is slippery and for sure not pleasant to step on it without water shoes.If you go at the begging, it is nice and turquoise water and no stones, sand is ok but of course it is crowded as everyone want to be there.It is for sure place to go if you are in Antalya becuse public beach on the harbor side is not really good- water is kind of muddled."
145,Beautiful ,This is one of the loveliest beaches we have been to. Soft sand that is comfortable to walk on. Friendly tides that allow swimming. Toilets and changing rooms are available.The beach area is ringed by a park with gym equipment and sports facilities and some nice sculptures. Whats makes it even more stunning are the pine filled mountains in the background and the fortress on the cliffs.Try to go the portion of the beach labelled no 1 (next to cliffs ad where the basketball courts and parks are). Its much less crowded and has a great entry to the water.
146,Cozy and warm beach.,"Nice beach, nice restaurants and good facilities. Sunbeds and Parasols/sunshades are a good price, though definitely price changes from one beach to the next. The furthest from the center the cheaper it is."
147,Cleopatra beach where all love and history starts,As far as Alanya beaches go this is definitely the best beach out there and boy was it packed. The waves were fun. We went to the beach near the Alanya castle and the water there becomes deep very quickly and it gets colder at depth which could be dangerous for kids. TIP: Avoid dark water for it's full of seaweed.
148,Peaceful,This sandy beach is a must visit place when in Alanya. Stunning views and a lot of place to lay in the sun and swim
149,Better beach.,"Kleopatra beach is big sandy beach but one part of entrance to the sea is not sandy but slippery stone. How can you know which part of beach has sandy entrance? Beach has numbers from 1 to 22, and beaches from 1-14 have sandy entrance and from 14-22 are slippery. So be careful!"
150,Beautiful.,Absolutely stunning this place beautiful  clear water absolutely Gorgeous  loads beach bars  cafes had an amazing time x
151,Amazing beach,"Lovely beach Very clean Has showers on so you can wash sand off you upon leaving.7.50TR for an umbrella 17TR for beds and umbrella Staff are nice Only think you will find is there are a few stray dogs that come up to you occasionally.Be careful also first day we came the sea was lovely and kids went in the seas. Second time we came to this beach the sea was SO rough, cudnt let kids in I went in to see how rough it was so see if I was over reacting as my 7 year old was moaning to go in. My god I nearly drowned I nearly didn’t come out !! Mega rough and massive waves over and over again. Please be careful going in if it looks rough it is rough xox"
152,Aladdin Beach,We had to pay for the sun beds even though they were all empty. The beach itself was lovely and clean.
153,Somewhat disappointing,"Not a particularly good beach, there is no actual sand just small stones and the seabed is very dangerous with holes and slippery surfaces, however the temperature of the water was nice."
154,Lovely beach,"It is a normal wide beach, but not only sandy, there is a lot of pebbles and some left litter. I don't understand why it is so popular with applauses, it isn't bad of course, but didn't leave me very impressed. Of course a green park nearby is very beautiful."
155,lovely sandy beach,"It is a long coast and Kleopatra beach is very long beach, there are many beach clubs and facilities. Sea is warm and sandy, sometimes wavy. Enjoyable colours."
156,Too many russians,Kleopatra beach is going down. It’s dirty and there is garbage everywhere. Beach nro 7 ambrellas was in bad shape. Shower doesn’t work every time.
157,Warm sandy beaches,"The beach is beautiful and tidy 🏖 our family was satisfied 👌 near the beach is a bazaar , selling ice cream 🍦 and other snacks 👌"
158,Kleopatra comin’ atcha! ,Extremely lovely part of the beach. Friendly attentive bar/beach staff. Loved that they played reggae. Loved the beds to sunbath on even though we didn't use one. Beach 22 check it out you won't be disappointed...
159,Turkey blazer,"Clean sandy soft beach, many shops and food places nearby. Loads of sunbeds available with spaces and not fully taken. Many people were swimming in the sea which shows how clean it is. Sun would shine on the sea and make it look as if it is sparkling. The sunset at night would look beautiful. The prices of the shops on the beach are a little bit more expensive. For example, a twister ice lolly in a normal shop in the streets would be 1 lira, on the beach it would be 6 liras. But I guess that's just business. A friendly man would walk around to see if everyone is ok or whether they would like anything from the shops etc"
160,Recommended beach,Very nice beach with quite clear warm water (depends on weather). Mix of sand and gravel. Not to big. Little bit crowdy at high season.
161,Great but busy beach,"Tide can be a bit hectic... go to the beach at 6pm... in August this is the best time... cool sand, warm water. ..etc"
162,Beach,Amazing sand and amazing place Wonderful beach with perfect blue and clear water. Nice beach nr 12 . Amazing people. Definitely I will come back next year
163,Great beach ,It's so beautiful.  Make sure you be there when the sun goes down. The beach is surrounded with beautiful parks and nice cafes.
164,Wow,if you wanna be in alanya u must try this beach its quite nice place near the sentrom also telefirik also there
165,Lovely beach,The best beach in the Europe no stone no roksandy beach and all the way along you can very good swim there and have a great time.
166,Hot and crowded,Best beach in Alanya. The area is full of restaurants and cafes and various hotels.I recommend going here.
167,Clean beach,Visited cleopatara beach whilst in alanya. Lovely sandy beach with cafes and restaurants dotted along it. Definitely worth a visit sunbed hire very reasonable
168,Frank,"Kleopatra Beach has different sections - some with cliff as ground, others the whitest sand. Depends on who you are, and what you preferences are (mine’s sand), but both are options. Along the beach are small restaurants, some better than others, and at a reasonable price-point. Note that most beachchairs belong to the hotels along the city, so you either have to buy from the restaurant located close by, or stay at either hotel."
169,Local beach ,Beautiful beach with plenty of free sunbeds if using the bars. warm waters with crashing waves. highly recommended.
170,Kleopatra beach,Some really nice sun sets .smalls pebbles rather than sand. Plenty of seating  just off the beach as well as fitness and children's play areas
171,Lovely beach,The water is warm all day long.  It's more warmer than the swimming pool ! It has guests in it from 6 in the morning till sun down . So blue !!!!
172,busy beach,"Beautiful beach, service to your chair and pay at the end of your stay ! Food was lovely the sea was a little nippy getting in but once in was refreshing"
173,Its a beach like others,Lovely beach and sea ..... be aware on the jetty they really really stress out people I know it's their business but if your not interested walk further along the front and you miss it
174,Nicest in Alanya,Beautiful wide beach with tiny stones and great landscape pictures. You can see beautiful castle on the top of the hill. Water is very clean with comfortable entrance.
175,Beautiful,Pictures: Kleopatra seen from a boat tip. One day later we went for swimming at Kleopatra. It is a fantastic view every time again.
176,Brilliant beach ,"Sand is coarse, pebbles are sharp.Beach is clean, staff friendly, food was nice, lots of soft drinks availability."
177,Very open,Fun waves and nice sands. Completely overrun by hotels. “Renting” a sunbed is a must. Better then I expected.
178,The most beautiful beach :),Such a wonderful beach to visit and plenty of amenities close by too ! The sunsets are so magical to watchband the cable car is very good value for money too !
179,Amazing beach,"It took us 5 days to find that beach lots of people existed of. The whole beach divided into numerous parts, and we checked most of them to find exactly that one. The beach is free, that pleases. There you can buy chaise lounge or bring blanket and no one will treat you. The depth was too unexpected and it was very dangerous for me, because I am not able to swim and hardly didn't dawn (thanks to my friend). On the beach I didn't see any rescuers this was unpleasant. And almost whole day long were big waves (but I think it depends of time of the year)"
180,The beach where's flamingo live ,Stunning beach! The water was very inviting & everything was clean & tidy. Worth the visit if you are near by
181,Paradise on Earth,Arrived for Easter break with friends across road from our hotel. Very clean. Beach bars not open yet. Even loungers just arrived. Lots of hotel bars and facilities open to use. Highly recommend this beach. Walking along leads to many locations in area. Lovely views. Sea still cool. Can’t wait to return.
182,White sand,"A beautiful stretch of sand on the west side of Alanya, this beach is well worth a visit. Lots of cafes, shops and sunbeds. Sea is fantastic to swim in, clean and warm. Best place to view is from Castle or cable car. Stunning."
183,Lovely,Busy beautiful beach it's more like grit than sand but white and soft. It's located at the other side of the castle near the cable cars and lots of busy big hotels.
184,Great views,Don’t miss the opportunity to go here when in alanya . Great beach and good facilities. Enjoy it and let’s not forget the weather and very cheap places to eat
185,Good time out there,This is a big beach. All sections numbered so you cannot forget where you are on the lovely tree lined promenade right into the main town.
186,Wow,"This beach was fairly beautiful....the waves were incredibly rough and completely knocked me over, I didn't want to go back, but we did another day and luckily the sea was very calm, clear and enjoyed it more.There are a few cafes on the beach very friendly staff, I had my first Turkish coffee! Which was beautiful...There are showers there also to rinse yourself.....which was helpful.....can I recommend the cable cars, very enjoyable....Go and have fun!"
187,Best beach,"We went for a week. We really enjoyed it. The hotel is very clean, the service was nice and the food was good quality. The town itself is very clean, safe to stay out all day long regardless the time. People are very welcoming. The beach is very clean and easily accessible from the hotel."
188,"Hot Sand, Strong currents",Hello my friend!Kleoparta beach is cosy place.  It's a place where the time is nothing. The quiet waves of salt and crystal Mediterranean sea lay appon your leg's. The only word- The land of legends.
189,excellent beach,Great beach with plenty of space to relax on the sand or one of the restaurant sunloungers. The water was nice and warm but gets deep fairly quickly!
190,Clean and White sand beach,"One of the nicer beaches we found during our stay, but it’s very rocky - good for snorkelling if you don’t want to go too far out, there is fishes to look at. But I was worried about the kids slipping on the rocks, although they’re flat and didn’t appear sharp.Water was Chrystal clear and warm. Worth a visit. Little shop on the beach for drinks and ice creams."
191,Fun beach,"Great beach for all type of people. You have to pay for the bed and umbrella 2,5 euro. The beach is very clean"
192,Nice beach,Dirty beach and the first two lounge chair lines were kept by the beach workers who  reserved them for money although they were provided free by the hotel.The sea has stones and gets very deep about 2-3 meters depth after 4 meters from the shore
193,Lovely beach,"Loved this beach, veryclean and great atmosphere... service was really good i would definitely recommend... only down side u have to pay for everything eg towels,  sun bed etc"
194,Beach no one says,"Love Alanya beach, plenty of sun beds to hire at reasonable prices, lots of bars. In particular The Green beach, I thoroughly recommend see my remarks. Lots more bars, and shops. Everything you need for the beach is close at hand, warm safe sea. Lovely walks along the beach gardens too, with fountains and bars here. It makes Alanya, perfect for children."
195,Good beach,"My son and I had an amazing time in Alanya, we had a great stay at the Kleopatra Atlas Hotel, the rooms where very clean and comfortable. The staff where very nice and helpful the food was ok but we were out of season so the hotel was quiet, so I felt the breakfast was quite poor for choice and evening meals were repetitive. I have visited Alanya a number of times and always have time to go have my hair done when I have time to spare and have had no complaints in fact always say how the hairdressers seem to give me a better cut. BUT I popped into CONSTANTINES hairdressers as they had a tattoo shop next door that my son was interested in having a look so I thought I would kill 2 birds one stone! I made an appointment was asked for a £20 deposit which I found a bit weird! As I had never been asked in 6 years for a deposit before? Anyway I say d I'm looking for a colour and cut and was told it would be £40 and would I pay 50% I said ok. I went back the next day and had 2 young lads apply my colour then another cut my hair then dried it, there where puffs of smoke coming of my hair! Soon it was all over I went to pay and was told that will be £100!! I didn't pay it of course! Anyway we settled the price at £50 which I was still not happy with! But NEXT DAY I washed my hair and couldn't brush it, it was a tangled mess as these idiots had completely fried my hair! I have to pack it with serum or it looks like someone is holding balloons all round it! Totally static all the time! ITS A TOTAL MESS! PLEASE PLEASE DONT BE FOOLED BY THESE RIP OFF ARTISTS THAT DESTROYED MY HAIR! GO TO ONE OF THE SMALLER MORE RELIABLE HAIR SALONS!"
196,have to go,"Kleoatra beach is perhaps not the prettiest I've seen but that said the views are good, with lots of beach side restaurants. The sea is quite calm,with water sports and boat trips aplenty, check out the pirate ships... price includes a buffet meal."
197,Not bad,"Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor, we went to Cleopatra beach, thinking that it's a sandy beach. There are NO sandy beaches in Alanya and in places around it. It's covered with fine shingles but not sand. So, bear that in mind. It is clean but you have to pay for sunbeds and parasoles. 10 TL per sunbed and 10 for a parasole. It can be pretty windy and the waves can be pretty strong, so if you are not a good swimmer, be prepared to end up on your bottom😀. All in all, not so impressed."
198,Nice Beach,"We accessed this via beach '6' was affiliated with our hotel. Rented the sunbeds and sunshade.The sand is very loose and course, yet comfortable to walk bare foot on. Swimming in the warm Mediterranean sea is a lovely experience. Getting out however is less so! There is a sharp shelf and with the strong waves hitting you it can be a struggle.To describe my exit from the sea would be more 'beached sealion' than anything else!Facilities to wash feet are available and plenty of places to eat and drink.Exceptionally clean and free from litter."
199,It's a beach,A lovely clean beach that is well maintained. Most of the beach is taken up with sunbeds and umbrellas.
200,Great beach,"Great beach with plenty of beds etc. Tennis courts, beach volley ball and all the facilities. Just be carefull going in the water as has a steep slope a few feet in but once in you can paddle out about 10meters and its still only waist height.Just keep change as its 2 lire to use a loo"
201,Golden sandy beach,"Lovely sand with clear water , very big beach more than 2 km . The turkish Miami beach . location is near an old castle and the city . Must see the view from the castle ."
202,Beautiful and clean beach,This is quite a long beach. A beautiful sandy beach. You can also go up to the castle and see this beach from aboce. The landscape it truly amazing. There are cool places around the beach where you can eat and drink.
203,Lovely beach,Clear water nice clean beach beautiful place to watch the sunrise or sunset great place to spend it with your family
204,Deep,Visited kleopatra beach with my friend omg was clean and beautiful service on beach was amazzing the sea was crystal clear absolutly stunning !!!!♥️
205,"A gorgeous beach - that says it all, really",It is very nice beach in Alanya. Long sandy beach with nice sea entrance. There are also showers in the beach. Very famous beach in that place.
206,Amazing view from the top of Ahmadek citadel,One of the best beach in the world . In the evening especially sunset is wonderfull . There are a lot cafe near beach . Service also good enough.
207,Alanya,Hi everyone! I want write something about this fantastic place! It was perfect experience for us! History and nature together. While you swimming in the clean&fresh sea you can see Alanya Castle which is construction by Rome Empire&Seljuk Empire. Beach is also good. along from beginning till end  fcompletely sand. We liked it!!!
208,Great beach,"Beautiful blue flag beach.  Sand is amazing. History behind the beach. And so much to do.  I’ve cream brought near by. So tasty, cheap and man so friendly and made the kids laugh. Lovely castle, lot of steep walking. Cable car to the top. Beautiful views. No need to go right at the top, can enjoy the views from the end of cable cars 🚠 if have difficulty walking. Beautiful gardens and seating area. Definitely visit it is so worth it.  Take time and enjoy the waves and the breeze and the noise of the waves.  Never enough time. Just to beautiful."
209,This is NOT a sandy beach!,"I Recommend it. Clear water aquamarine colour. Clean white sand. Bars on the beach, shower, Las Palmas, green gardens."
210,Allaadin beach ,"It's just a beach, it has ""Kleopatra"" in the name, but it's just a beach. It's worth to go there to see it, but than again - there are thousands of other beaches there, same like this."
211,Good place,Good place to stay for couple of hours. Facilities are available. At this month weather was excellent.
212,Amaizing Blue,"this is a sand beach located in the center and accumulated everything - civilized beach service, cafes, entertainment , etc"
213,BEAUTIFUL,We found two sides of Alanya - the beach or the harbour. The harbour takes you to boattrips to see fish or places to dive. The beach is nice. Do make a visit to Alanya Gardens. You must see the blue bridge over the waterpond. Nice! Every pier has a small bar/restaurant too. And free wi-fi.
214,Extremely Blue ,"Great stretch of beach No pebbles , bars offering free lounges Water sports Warm seas with plenty of fish for snorkelling fans"
215,Amazing place to be. ,Beautiful clean beach with numerous sun beds and loungers at around £1.50 each a day nice beach bars and lovely staff our beach bar was number 6 hut bar manger there (echo) was so lovely and helpful 👍🏼
216,Holiday,"Stunning beach, lots of little bars across the seafront. You can hire a 4 poster sunbed for €8 for the day, which we didn't think was bad at all.. one end of the beach offers water sports. It's a little pebbly as you walk into the sea at first but after a few steps it's smooth sand & the only beach we visited in Turkey where it's like that. There's also shops a stone throw away if you wanted/needed to get anything."
217,God on the beach 🔱,"İf  you came to Alanya, you should see!Because  the sea here is wonderful. In the center of Alanya. Attention too crowded"
218,A lovely week spent on the beach,"A clean and sandy beach, with lovely blue warm sea.  Good facilities,  numerous sun recliners and parasols for hire (10TR each, about £1.30) lots of bars/restaurants on the beach and close by."
219,Very nice sandy beach,First holiday on a beach with my wife and son. Started off with some issues. Manager saw I was upset with a few things he came up to me to ask me how they could improve my holiday. Really nice guy really went above and beyond. Shops close by aswel. If your have any special requests ask he dies all he can to help out. Thanks for the great holiday
220,Nice beach,"It not good for children, To deep from the beginning of the beach, so you need really to keep eye on them"
221,Great beach ,The beach itself is nothing special. It's not fins sand it's more like minirocks /rough sand. The wster was nice tho and the surroundings looked beautiful from the beach with all the mountains going around.
222,amazing,"Excellent beach with very warm, clear water. The beach is nice and spacious with drinks available. You can also get water sports here for the thrill seekers. Recommend. *****"
223,Very nice,Wonderful beach with a wonderful view. To left up on the cliff you see the castle. Under the castle amazing rocks with lagoons. Be careful when you swimming if it’s red flag. The waves are so much stronger than you can think of.
224,Very nice beach with quite clear water,"Beautiful sandy beach with bars,playgrounds,gardens,toilets,changing rooms and showers all along.The waves can be quite rough and there's a slimy rock as you enter the sea so not very suitable for children,that's why one point down."
225,goood :-),"Great beach. Comfy sun loungers and umbrellas. Drinks service to all areas. Clean, safe and amazing sunsets"
226,Nice Beach,What more could you want good clean beach and water great to chill ..try night time 8 9pm water is still warm swimming under the stars also get yourself a snorkel
227,Great Beach,The beach is quite long so everyone should be able to find a good spot to relax and swim. Lounge chairs and umbrellas are available for a fee all along the beach. There are plenty of snack places and bars nearby on the beach and on the main street. The new cable car to the castle hill (worth visiting) departs from this beach.
228,Beach,This is by far the best beach in Alanya Plenty of water sports etc. Plenty of Beach bars with free wi-fi.
229,Very nice beach,"İt's really beautiful and cozy, not far from the city center. The main attraction of Damlataş is the beach, and it's parks, tennis courts and table tennis."
230,"It not good for children, To deep from the beginning of the beach","When going there out of season, you can feel it as your own personal territory: quite wide, nice clean sand & blue and clear water."
231,Tourist beach ,This is a beautiful beach with masses of facilities to suit all ages.  It is very clean with very soft sand.  The water is crystal clear and the setting magnificent.  It is a wonderful place to relax.
232,Nice beach,nice beach clean and free entrance when u go there take the teleferic to kalezi for 18 TL round turn
233,Beautiful ,"Beach is cleanService is available you can take chair, you can buy food and drinks for an average price.Recommend"

235,Nice Beach,"Amazing view from the top of Ahmadek citadel, where the beautiful and clearness view, it's so beautiful."
236,Great beach,"Beautiful beach with many beach bars,And long pathed walks plenty of seating,Many activities.Water fountain.Cable car for castle (Worth a trip)"
237,direct acces to the Mediterranean,"One of my favorite beach in Alanya. Clean, sandy, sunbeds available to a good price. Not recommended for really small children because of that it’s deep fast, but great waves. I prefer part of the beach near Alanya castle. You can visit Alanya castle in the morning and after that spend time on the beach."
238,Alanya beach,"We are staying in Hatipoglu hotel right across the Kleopatra beach.It is a big sandy beach.to rent a umbrella and two beach chairs cost about 4euro a day,if you stay for more days they give you discount (buy 4 get one more free).you have bars with wifi on every sector of the beach.water is warm.Today is 1st on September and it is very hot,water is above 26 degrees.To summarize this is the best beach in Alanya,you will enjoy it."
239,Part of Alanya Tour,The golden sand of the beach make you feel like ancient god. That heals your skin to shine like sun. Warm salty water of sea helps to get cool and relax. Beauty time travel takes you another world of life. 〽️
240,"Great sandy beach, but wavy","Quite simply a stunning beach, must be seen for the views. Pure sand, warm clear water, no wonder it's legendary."
241,Beach 16,"Wonderful sea and beach at town center with dining facilities around. Also Damlataş Cave , which has asthma healing properly has been nearby."
242,Great sandy beach,Our hotel was across the road from this beach and just wow! Everything about it was perfect. We were on beach #10. Just wish we weren’t going home. Sea suitable for young kids and there a small stream flowing in to allow kids to build their sandcastles without the waves destroying them
243,Small rocky wavy,"We did not go to Kleopatra Beach, so cannot comment on that.  We did go on the beach, it was ok, i went into the sea, big stones were underneath the sea  big boulder's wasn't very nice to swim in."
244,Beautiful ,"Nice and clean. Good service on the beach. But when u bought water or soda it cost two, three Times more then the regular shop, that was located 3-5 minutes from the your sun chairs on the beach."
245,Golden sands,"Okeey beach, kinda dirty, would recomend this for the youngsters that wants to party due to all the bars around. If you want a clean and nice beach, visit the small locations around."
246,Gorgeous beach,"A beautiful clean beach, wasn’t too busy and plenty of options for places to have a drink and chill. Water is very warm also."
247,😍,"ITS realt Good beachvolley , and activity .many shops  and restaurants so near by .And many attractive places."
248,love it,"Cleopatra Beach is the most beautiful beach I have been to so far. It is made of fine gravel, which I personally adore because it does not sting when walking and yet it is not like sand that it cannot be removed when it is glued to everything possible. Sunbeds are mostly rented from the hotel but can also be paid for at your own expense and I think the price for two sunbeds and an umbrella is around 25-30tl depending on the number of the beach and the person in charge of the sale. I was at beach 7 and everything was correct. Each part of the beach has its own bar where you can buy drinks or ice cream. The very entrance to the beach is tiny pebbles that turn into stone slabs as you enter deeper. We were there for 10 days and there were waves every day, which we like. It may be a little more inconvenient for small children but it’s not that scary. It is important to go through that first part where the waves break (if they are stronger that day) and the rest is really OK. Plenty of kids bathed with hoses and muscles. The beach is quite wide about 80m and deck chairs are placed away from the sea so you can put a towel in front or bring your umbrella. The beach has a free shower and a changing cabin."
249,Good trip in general,Clean - plenty beds -showers - service good - sea easy access lovely and warm . Good fun in waves. Reasonable prices good bar service . Usual water sports
250,Beautiful beach,"Beach is kept in good condition. Obviously a lot of people, but not to a point where it's uncomfortable. Strong waves, super salty water."
251,Lovely but be aware,"One of my favourite place in Alanya. Without being there, a holiday in Alanya is not a real holiday. This is where sun, sand and sea meet eachother and delivers outstanding moments."
252,"Nice beach, but becomes deep quickly","Clean beach , warm sea big waves , cool beers  worth a vist it’s the camera as the sun goes down as the sunsets are fav"
253,A must do,You must try the beach 19.50 lira for sun beds and parasol to be paid at hotel reception good value.
254,Nice beach but not very clean ,Wow. As the beach is separated into different segments we visited section 22. What a place. Had to be simply the best beach in Turkey. Simply beautiful
255,Best beach in Alanya. TIP: Avoid dark water for it's full of seaweed,"If you love beach life and travel to Alanya, yuo have to go to beach n:o 1. You wont find another place with a such of sand like that in whole Alanya. Pay a visit, you won't be disappointed."
256,Stunning beach!,"Free public sand beach with extra umbrellas and sunbeds. Oriental style sunbeds with baldaquin available in some sectors. Some sport activities - parasailing, banana, divan, water motorcycle, place for basketball."
257,Beautiful but very busy!,Good enough. Clear water. Good service. Lots of people. Pay for deckchairs. Bit noisy. Toilet 1lira.
258,Very dirty,"We stayed at the Grand Zaman Beach Hotel, a five minute walk to Kelopatra beach.  Although hotel experience was not good, the beach was fantastic.  The water is so clear and waves are almost non existent and old castle just a stone throw away."
259,Beautiful,Nice n clean water perfect shops and  taxi nearby. Food and drinks avail on the beach sunbed 30 liras
260,Okay,"Perfect for couples, wanting to enjoy a day at the beach. But be careful bringing kids here... when you walk out into the water - it suddenly is becomes very deep."
261,day out,"This side of Alanya has unspoilt, white, clean sandy beaches, compared to the otherside which is stoney and full of sand flies(that bite!)."
262,Best beach in Alanya,"Not over commercialised. Lovely golden sand, very clean with a few nice bars and restaurants tastefully done. Do expect a small charge for sun beds etc. Can walk to the castle end and look round the pretty gardens and perhaps get the cable car up to the castle."
263,Great beach 10 also good food at beach bar to be paid for very cheap.,First 2 parts are really so dirty to many tree leaves which comes from trees around castle have to find out for that and make it more clear 3 point is for rest of it i would say perfect if all would be same
264,Beach,The beach pefect! i love it! sand beach littil bit rocks deaper under water. mant restaurants near. and around mountains.
265,We visited the beach once or twice,"Beautiful clean sandy beach. Excellent location next to cable cars, cave and castle. Free toilets and changing facilities available. Parking only cost 5 lira for 4 hours. Can sit and relax for hours."
266,the best beach in Alanya,The Cleopatra Beach was just amazing!!! It was we;; worth the visit. would have liked to have spent more time there.
267,Good,"If you like to relax for a full day on  board of a boat; you should book the boat trip to Kleopatra Island.The person in charge of this tour will pass and pick you up from your hotel in Marmaris, take you to the port then your day will begin.You can have a tan, swim whenever they stop for a swimming break then at noon you will have about 2 hours to visit Kleopatra Island where you can find some archaeological sites and spend a relaxing time on the white sandy beach. N.B: You cannot sit on the beach, it is forbidden in order to save the environment but you can stay on one of the lounge chair nearby.However, the water is clear, deep blue, clean, the island is nice.Some tours to this island include Jeep Safari where you can spend some more time visiting the Island ; it depends on your preferences."
268,Best Beach in Alanya,"Crystal clear water, mountain with history, sitting area with park, many cats playing around, cable car within walking distance. Worth a visit."
269,Beautiful beach would come again ,"Nice beach but nothing special , much prefer olu deniz and Fethiye beaches . Would not really recommend at all"
270,Alanya best beach,Wavy sea with very small rocky. Per sunbed and umbrella is 7.5 tl. There are showers and cabinets. Food and drinks are expensive.
271,Wonderful beach!,"Alanya is a very busy beach town big enough to be called a city.Hustle & bustle vast amounts of traffic the beaches are best described as sharp sand/ Gritty NOT soft sand.Fruit & veg on markets unbelievably cheap the rest of the market selling fake clothes are decent quality but best avoided they can be found cheaper in the thousands of shops open til midnight where you can see the displayed prices & avoid the hassle & rip off prices.Lots of big retail clothing shops reasonable prices but take a walk a couple of streets back to avoid tourist prices just like the restuarants if the Turkish are eating there it's more likely to be cheaper better quality and more authentic.Travelling by buses are so cheap approx 3TL gor 3 mile journeys from Oba etc, but be warned in summer months & peak times it is like cattle trucks squeezed in standing only & upto 100 people on the bus. Mahmuttlar well worth a visit more Turkish & cheaper than Alanya bus only 3 TL.Coaches to other towns are totally different very cheap travel to Manavgat 15 TL each way every 30 minutes on ac coach with guaranteed seat some offer free water & coffee NO standing luxury travel compared to buses & so cheap for long distance & great way to see other towns check out just go to Alanya bus station Octogar you can travel to almost anywhere you do not need to buy tourist tours which take you to carpet shops etc, just use the coaches so you are not time restriced.All in all Alanya is a thriving busy seaside town but think of it as a busy city with traffic thousands of shops open til midnight lots of hustle and bustle with pirate party boats & buses full to the rafters and beaches with sharp sand the sea can be very rough with large waves & get deep very quickly."
272,Nice 🏖 ,nice beach dedicated to Kleopatra who swam in this sea in this beach.All along the beach are toilets and restaurants. chairs and parasols(20TL for 1 day)
273,Great beach,The location of the beach was lovely and only a minute from our hotel. There were plenty of beds available as well as lots of places to eat and drink.Only downside was that the sand is shingle and the sea is very rocky to get in. The current is very strong and quickly takes you out. There is also a sudden drop from shallow to deep water. I didnt see any life guards whilst visiting.
274,Best Beach and best Beach Bar Boys .. ,"The sand is very hot, very hot. You will not be able to walk bare foot on it. There are plenty of sun lounges and umbrellas for rent on the beach, which you will need as it was so hot. They only cost a £1 or so. Each beach bar has a section of beach renting areas but you can sit right at the front by the water for free, you will need a towel to lay on and something to keep the sun off.We stayed at Bar 15, food and drinks are well priced, with the food being particular fantastic.They has a shower, changing cabins and loo nest door, which cost a 20pence to use. However it was clean.The edge of the sea drops down quickly to waist height but then remains a shallow decline the further out you go. As other people have said, the waves are large and powerful, I'm 6 ft 3 and struggled not to get knocked over a couple of times. You can not leave small children unattended. OUr teens were ok and enjoy the waves. As it was so hot you can go to the beach at 5pm and its still plenty warm enough for a couple of hours."
275,Beautiful beach with a festive atmosphere.,"It is a clean and well-equipped beach not far from the centre of Alanya. You can find free toilets or changing rooms there, as well as restaurants, parks... And, of course,a clean beach with safe parts for families with little children."
276,More clean up,"Beach 12 you are fantastic, Ali you are Number 1 always helpful and polite.Your beach is always clean and the food and drink is amazing.See you in 2020 ."
277,Perfection ,Relaxing there is sand there is water. Cant think of anything else to say to make up the words as its a beach
278,Nice sandy and long beach,"If you've visited Greece, then you won't like it. Huge rock is inside, and small ones everywhere else! It is deep and not very safe for children because of huge waves"
279,Beautiful Beach,My 8 year old daughter jumped from a rock intothe very shallow water (about 20cm) and into sharp broken glass which was embedded into the sand. She lacerated her foot in 4 different places and had 10 stitches! Hospital charged us Euros 500 for the anaesthetic injections and stitches. We didn’t have travel insurance (first time ever I didn’t take it!). Worst holiday of mr life!
280,Wow ,The beach is sectioned into zones from beach one up to beach 18 ( I think) each zone has its own sun loungers and umbrellas and beach bar. I think the WiFi is better on some beaches than others and the charges for the loungers is different.
281,Worst beach ever!,"People wanting to visit this beach should know that there is no restriction on what you wear, so those with children should preferably avoid. However, those going alone or as a couple, this is definitely where you want to go. The night view of Alanya Castle is stunning."
282,A normal beach,Beaches kleopatra beautiful beach Just across the street from hotel Riviera. Family friendly water sports
283,Lovely beach,"Great location, solid facilities, highly affordable in general... But what separates this beach from the others I've seen in Turkey, is the magnificent turqoise blue of the sea."
284,Good,"Since it was only 18 degrees, not many visitors were there. With sun chairs and two beers, our visit cost 42 Lira. The bathrooms were locked, but perhaps one of the bars had the keys.Enjoyed a quiet sunny afternoon after visiting the castle by cable car."
285,topless women on the beach,"Great beach, just below the fortress of Alanya, clear and warm sea, sand of phenomenal granulation.There are 2 great beach bars right next to it, as well as a Damlatash Cave that is well worth a visit."
286,Beach is Amazing 😉 AVIOD CONTANTINES HAIRDRESSERS AT ALL COSTS!,"Clean sand, plenty of sunbeds and parasols for a reasonable charge,beach cafes and toilets.The north side of the castle has some rocks in the water  so you need to be careful. Plenty of activities, paragliding, jet skis etc"
287,Best beach in Alanya? ,"A beach not so big, but good enough. Clean, sunbeds available to a good price, free for hotelguest (Palmiye Beach).The ocean is crystalclear and clean. Not recommended for really small children because of that it’s deep fast, but great waves!! Not too big or so, but fun. Restaurants available at many places. Kleopatra is the best here in Alanya!"
288,Vacation,The water within 10 feet of shore was full of garbage. small pieces of plastic to large plastic bags. Lots of trash was like swimming in a sea of gaebage.  Once you got about 20 feet away from shore it was much cleaner.  I had small children so very unpleasant. I will never go to this beach again.
289,A place to spend few hours,It may be disappointing sometimes but I can say that the beach is so good at all. I recommend you to go here mornings.
290,Sun sand sea,"4 from 5 because of small amount of trash in could be found in sand, it's aloud to smoke on the beach and dogs were running around the beach."
291,Not as beautiful as the photos!,Best of the two beaches. A walk from Damlatas caves along the prom towars Konakli is a perfect way to relax.
292,"Family friendly beach, with pebbles not sand.","Kleopatri beach is a nice 2,5 km long and well-equipped beach near Alanya city. Near the beach promenade you find cafes,restaurants and shops."
293,The best beach in Alanya,This was part of my Alanya tour. Nothing special. But it is part of the tour. Wouldnt make a special visit for it; however the pirates of the Caribbean ship is there; that will make your day. The beach it self looks like every other beach.
294,Enjoyable view,beash was great waling wiht naked feer it made some masage to freets its great effort pecialy if u have some problems in legs its andu have them ofter n tiered after walking there u can feel ur legs geting bether feel greatalso must say if u not great swimer water gets deep quick but u have some like 3-4m water juts to knee so there are some great walinkg in sea
295,Not suitable for children!,Alanya may be a lonnnggggg way from Antalya airport but it’s certainly worth the journey. Absolutely spotless and buzzing. On the main strip and in the thick of everything. Can’t go wrong. If you’re not staying in any of the named hotels you can still pay a small nominal fee to use the sun loungers. Everyone is very helpful and there’s toilets so it’s a win win deal!
296,Fab Views,"This bustling stretch of sand can be found in Alanya, a resort town in southwestern Turkey. Kleopatra Beach extends a considerable length on the town’s west end, featuring lounge rentals and a promenade. The Mediterranean Sea here is well-suited for swimming and water sports alike. Numerous beachside cafes and bars line the coastal road, though Alanya’s historic section promises far more authentic charm. Beachgoers can enjoy views of the looming Alanya Castle, though trekking up to the well-preserved fortification is worth the effort for expansive vistas over the surrounding sea and town below."
297,Nice enough beach ,"Hey, if you have kids and you don't want to allow them to see topless women, just choose to go to another beach. Topless women are sexy and attractive.I have daughters and they don't mind at all seeing other women topless on the beach. Now, maybe a teen boy could be aroused but I highly doubt that he would mind enjoying the view. So, stop being prudes or go to another beach."
298,Holiday review,If you like to have a little bit more privacy then come join Aladdin Beach the staff is very helpful and serve drinks and food on your sunbed the prices are normal and the bathroom is free of charge
299,Kleopatra Beach,"Dårlig frokost, rommene burde vært bedre, basseng virker ut som om det burde trengt en rens....So so ålace not good anough to recomended good coffee good cheese for breakfas thats all the rest i cant say so good no place to go back"
