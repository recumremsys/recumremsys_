0,Amazing beach to have,Cleanest beach in Goa visited so far. The beach has a great view of Taj Fort Agauda and the most cleanest beach ever visited by me. Beach known for shacks and amazing food. Visited with family in the month of September.
1,Clean and Calm Beach,The sinqurium beach is one of the most beautiful white sand beach in North Goa. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is broken glass bottles found everywhere. It was cause of concern to all visitors there who had a risk of being hurt. Else it was a calm quite and beautiful beach. We had a good time there except being focussed on not getting hurt. I think Goa administration shall look into the matter with concern and take corrective action.
2,My Local beach,recommend the tourist in Goa to visit Sinquerim Beach. the most scenic calm n less crowded beach of north goa. Sinquerim beach is quieter than Candolim and a lot quieter than Calangute. This beach is perfect
3,Good Place to Relax.,"It a a nice beach near Candolim. Not overcrowded with other popular beaches of north goa and is easily accessible. Not very far from Fort Aguada as well. Some water-sports are also possible to enjoy here. Not being a rocky beach, sea bathing is also possible."
4,Relax under shade on beach,"It's a very beautiful beach of North Goa.This beach offers amazing sunset view.As compared to other beaches of north Goa, this beach is less crowded and its clean as well.Good place for photography.Must Visit."
5,Gud place to chill out,"The beach is very clean and close to Aguada fort and walking distance from the 2 Taj properties. It has few shacks and options for water sports also. However, water sports is costly as compared to other beaches. This is may be due to the prime location (close to 5 star properties). Less crowded compared to others and yes we spotted dolphins near the beach.."
6,Best place for couples,This is a very good beach in north Goa.It is on the way to fort Aguada.this beach has a bastille entering in sea & it gives excellent point to see beaches far away.Beach is long & wide also has some rocky patch near bastille.Approach road is narrow & the road has many big hotels blocking the road with their vehicles.lot of photo points at this location.
7,Fort and Beach ,One of the best beaches in north goa. Maintained well and not much crowded. The view is also very good next to fort aguada implementation from taj management. Overall a nice spot to hangout in the evenings or early mornings.
8,Better than Candolim beach,"Sinquerim Beach is one of the best beaches in North Goa. As it is less crowded, you can spend some quality time with your partner. The view during sunset is really good."
9,one of the best beaches I've visited!,The lower Aguada fort is on of this beach. Great view with the Sea all around. Must visit in Goa. Suggested time twenty to thirty minutes.
10,Nice beach-great for sunsets,"It is adjacent to Taj Vivanta. Awesome view from the Aguada fort. They had some construction going on. So, we had to trek a bit to reach the beach. But the Sunset was very beautiful here."
11,Overcrowded ,One of the good beaches to visit in Goa . Overlooking Green water and yellow whitish sand . Not very populated and hence an ideal place . Have fort like structures near shoreline .
12,A beautiful beach with affordable cost of water sports,"This beach is adjacent to Aguada fort. Nice, comparatively less crowded beach. Can visit for the sunset view after visiting Fort Aguada and spend some peaceful time."
13,Clean Beach,This is one of the more clean beaches of Goa. Its not visited by many people and hence is nice and peaceful.
14,"Clean Beach , close to Aguada Fort",A very good beach on the one side of Taj hotel Resort Fort Aguada and Arabian Sea on the other side. Beach is very clean and sandy but tidal waves are quite big. Though very njoy able. Life guards are there to guide you always. And it’s not crowded so you will njoy the sea bath. Near to Fort Aguada . Njoyable.
15,Nothing Special,This is one of the cleanest beach I visited in Goa. Next to Taj vivanta it wasn't crowded though tourist buses were coming. No beach side shacks were visible maybe bec of off-season (monsoon). Waves were hitting the shore with ferocity. Rang de basanti shooting happended nearby on the fort Aquada wall remains. Must visit.
16,scenic beaches,"This is one of the less visited beach in goa and offers a lot of beach activities at a great price, the road to the beach is getting revamped and they have made a makeshift road which is a difficult to take especially for old family members."
17,1hr Boat Ride (Just to kill time & visit one more Beach),this beach has direct access from Taj Properties. Very clean and has nice white sand. However not safe for swim or even for just being in the waves with kids. We have been told that during monsoon sea takes all the sand and gives a sharp slope to the shore. so be very careful during monsoon. there are lifeguards as well to caution you. Hopefully its safe in summer.
18,Nothing great,"The beach is located close to Candolim. The view from the fort area is amazing. The beach is clean, and good to spend an evening."
19,Good,One of the best beach in Goa. The water is very clean and clear the place is too awesome. You can find decent people enjoy sunbath and enjoying water sports. View of this beach is too awesome.
20,Clean & hygienic beach,You get awesome sunrise & sunset view from the beach. A road beside the Taj Vivanta leads to the beach.
21,Super clean and uncrowded!,A lovely scenic beach. Just near to Fort Agauda. You can see the sunset from part of the fort. Average crowded beach but surely one of the top 3 beaches of North Goa
22,Not a very popular beach but peaceful,"One of the best beach in North Goa.There are lots of water sports activities like Speedboat,Water Scooter, Sofa ride, Paragliding and dolphin watching in morning. I must say a very clean and beautiful beach near Panaji."
23,Sinquerium ,A must visit beach in North Goa.. Near to candolim.. this beach give you a view of turquoise water and next to lower aguada fort for a panoramic view..
24, peaceful and clean,"White sand beachVery cleanLess crowded as compared to Calangute and Baga.Has friendly water sports guides.Very near fort aguada.All in all, worth a visit"
25,Nice place,"This is the closest beach to Aguada fort, which is one of the most spectacular beaches in goa. The small stone pathway in this beach is very special. Less commercial and less crowded."
26,Clean Beach,This is a quiet clean beach in north goa primarily shared by Taj Fort Aguada and Taj Holiday Village.
27,Good fun,"This is one of the better looking beaches in Goa, the beauty of this beach is it is not overcrowded like Baga beach. One can have a great day enjoying waves and frothy beer."
28,Okhay! Good for walking.,This beach is very peaceful compared to Calangute or Baga beaches. It provides a host of water sports facility but has also a long stretch of sand by the shore to just sit and laze.
29,Another good beach of Goa but same like Calangute,One of the better Goanese Beaches whcih are still tolerable and nice and not like baga so worth going there
30,A family vacation,"This is one of the best beaches to visit while in North Goa. It is quite clean, less crowded, and offers good water sport activities. Including jet ski, para sailing, banana boat, boating trip for dolphin watching, etc. Nice place to visit for family."
31,Dog alert!,This is a very small beach and picturesque. can be easily viewed from the Sinquerim fort which lies just above the Sinquerim Beach.
32,Must visit,This beach starts from fort and has a decent shore line. Clean water and with fishes of many varieties.adjacent is taj hotel. Motor boat  ride for dolphin watching and cellular jail sightseeing possible.
33,Calm & Serene Beach away from hustle,"Sinquerim Beach is 1st beach to start the long shore line of North Goa...once u enter from Panjim side. Fort Aquoda n This beach makes together a lethal combination to spend some time in tranquility. Great views from various heights of the ocean. Different views, photo angles, proximity to Taj Resort. This beach has in all which other beaches do not have....sunset view was breathtaking from a height...must go place...but recommended cab with chaufer or best is to ride these with rented Bike.."
34,Good 🌊☀ beach with lot of activities,"Sinquerim beach like all other beaches of Goa was nice, calm and pleasant. We went there during monsoons so it didn't have much to offer."
35,Awesome experience,"Right out the Taj Holiday Resort and Spa, this beach is accessible from Fort Aquada also.  The beach is clean and has a string of restaurants all along it's stretch offering a choice of stay to suit different pockets.  Water sports activities are available.  Worth a visit."
36,Worth visiting,"Sinquerim beach is very beautiful, view's visible upto north beaches from sinquerim fort and beach. Swaying palm's, white sands, clear view's all'are charming and soothing."
37,Clean and neat,This beach is at opposite side of the Aguada fort. Certain part is occupied by TAJ hotels. Check my pics
38,Clean safe beach,"It is just beside aguda fort, after visiting aguda fort you can visit this beach it is calm, silent and less crowded."
39,It is nice,This is one of the best cleanest beaches I have visited in a India. Large stretch of the coast makes it good for a long scenic walk especially at sunset when the sun is the size of a dinner plate and has a beautiful colour!!!
40,Beach with a Bastion,Just 3 kms away from Aguada fort lies this pristine beach - Sinquerim Beach. Perfect escape getaways. This is next to Taj Aguada Hotel - away from hustle clean and one can enjoy watersport activities there. The Sinquerim Beach is beautiful with the blue sea on one side and the coconut trees on the other. One can see the view of the sea water hitting huge rocks at tremendous speeds next to fort line.
41,"clear sands, sparsely crowded, clean waters","this is one of the calm beach in Goa, not as crowded as the beaches in north goa. You can relax under the sun in this beach"
42,Sand like icing sugar,Nice beach specially visit in evening at the time of sunset. It is very near to Aguada Fort and after watching this fort (time of closing this fort is 5:30 p.m.) you may go to this beach. There is a small fort on this beach and watching arabian sea from this small fort is really amazing. Here wind blow very fast and you can feel a mood refreshing relax here. You may also do water sports here but I would prefer this beach specially to watch sunset.
43,Very peaceful! ,"it is the best beach in goa as water is quite clear, sand is white , its less crowded place and have awesome view."
44,Serene Sinquerim!!,"As compared to rest of beaches in north goa , this seems to be quiet and clean . Some activities were there as it was the end of may so they were closing down the activities on the beach but staying with vivante by taj and coming to sinquerim I feel it's a very nice place ."
45,Peaceful,"Very much next to Taj Fort Aguada Beach Resort of the Taj is this beautiful clean beach, where u could relax with few drinks of any sort and nice food of ur choice served right at relaxing spot.."
46,Exciting place to be at.,"It's a good beach with white sand. Few water sports available but more charges compared to baga may be because of a bit low in crowd. Beach is nearer to Aguada fort, Aguada beach and boat riding."
47,Secluded and almost private,"The sinquerium beach is a lovely beach with a distinct charm as it's near the fort and its a pleasure to the waves colliding with the fort. It is relatively clean and calm, a different experience than the more commercial Bagha Calungute etc."
48,Beautiful beach on Arabian sea,This is a very picturesque beach with flat shore of yellow sand bordered with coconut trees and an adjacent fort which acts as a stunning view point.
49,Great beach,"Quaint beach next to Taj Fort Aguada, great eating places around, best to visit in the off season and early evening"
50,Most beautiful,"Lovely beach on the shores of the Arabian Sea. Very good quality sand and excellent beach bars where the beds are free so long as you buy a drink/food. Near Fort Aguada, it can be a bit noisy with locals playing cricket an  the water sports. Sea can be a bit dangerous, but lifeguards patrol."
51,nice clean,"Peaceful beach surrounded by the fort area. Must try the water sports there as Sea is clean, beach is less crowded, you will see the nice view during the water sports. If you have large group of more than 5 people try bargaining for water sports."
52,Amazing Place ,"A clean beach, situated next to Taj hotels and accessible from these hotels. The beach is calm, less crowded and not very commercialized, hence one can relax and enjoy drink and dine with the family. The clean and long beach facilitates a lovely walk, especially when Sun is not blazing. The beachside shacks serve good drinks and foods. The water sports facilities are also available in the beach."
53,Serene,"Nice and peaceful, most of the area is covered with Taj hotels ( holiday village and fort Taj fort Aguda) but accessible to everyone. View is nice and you can have some peaceful time !!"
54,Superb stretch of beach spoild by rubbish,"housing mainly the fort aguada as well as taj fort aguada, this is a fairly clean beach. most of the water sports activites happen here and hence is abuzz with tourists. the walk from candolim beach till sinquerim is beautiful"
55,Beautiful beach,The furthest end of the beach near Aguada Fort is a huge attraction for local Indian people who travel to the beach for a day out. So that part gets really busy - but its fascinating to watch the fun and games. The boats - offering the usual sports - are noisy and a bit of a nuisance. Further up the beach becomes quieter before it heads up to the noisier and busier areas of Calengute etc.We stayed at the Taj by Vivanta holiday village and loved staying on one of their sun beds all day in a clam and quiet spot. Other people took advantage of free sunbeds outside the numerous shackes Dont be alarmed by cows strolling along the beach ! Quite a lovely sight .There are a lot of stray dogs on the beach - but they werent a nuisance.I walked a couple of miles on the beach most mornings and never felt threatened in any way .Litter is an issue. Every morning businesses would clear up the litter in  front of their shacks etc. But it didn't appear to be cleared up near the  Aguada Fort area - as if no one took responsibility for that section. So this area is obviously nt as clam andquiet as South Goa but not as mad and busy as the bigger resorts further North. I am planning on returning next year
56,good beach,"This beach is very neat and clean , less crowded, great for going with kids and fort Augoda is very near by"
57,Best beach in north goa,Sinquerim Beach is not a famous beach and hence less crowded. The beach and the shore is much beautiful. There are many rocks on the shore. Transport facility to the beach is available. The beach is calm and neat.
58,Great views,"Awesome place, this beach has got one of fort gates this is must visit place. clean beach with some food stalls."
59,Beautiful,"This is the best beach in sequence of beach starting from Bagha, calangute, Candoliem and Sinquerim Beach. Actually beauty of the beach is in reverse order may be it has inverse relationship with crowd. Sinquerim beach is comparatively less crowded among all above beach. View of beach from above the fort near Taj Aquada is really amazing. There are usual attraction like water sports etc. However, this place is relatively peaceful and you have private time compared to other North Goa beach."
60,Land of Taj,"One of the best beache with all sports activities here. Topping is fort view, which makes this awesome."
61,Very good views,Its a nice beach in north goa and most of the big hotels are near this. Only problem is there are many jellyfishes to watch out for at the beach.
62,Beautiful beach but full of jellyfishes,This is one of the less crowded beaches of Goa and often people take small boats to go for Dolphin sight seeing from this beach.
63,Quieter alrernative to Calangute/Candolim,Great beach with lots of water sports  at very good prices. It’s next to Aguada fort so good for sight seeing Don’t miss Tony’s for lunch best food in Candolim.
64,Nice beach almost on fort aguada,"this beach was a bit different from other beaches in Goa as it was next to for aquada and view from the mountain hill was amazing.it was bit risky as well as we had to climb down from the hill through narrow and rocky lanes... there was always a danger of slipping down... but upon reaching down onto the beach ..it was a feeling of achievement.it was very hot there, scorching heat... please cover your body properly and put on sun glasses for sure"
65,Clean beach ,A beautiful beach in north goa where you have lot of water sport activities. Watching the sunset here is too beautiful.This is one of the famous beach of north goa. It is famous for its amazing view and the activities.
66,Beautiful beach,"Very close to Agoda fort. Very less crowded. Some water sports activities are available here.but you have less time then skip and go to Calungate or baga beach. Agoda fort,  sinquerium beach, condolin beach  ,calungate beach and Baga beach these are in a line."
67,Water Sports in Goa,Probably.the most scenic calm n less crowded beach of north goa.. sitting the hours or watching sunset from this beach will always b a gud idea.. in.short a must visit place in goa..
68,A secluded and less visited beach,"Sinquerim beach is around 3 to 4 km from Aguada Fort. There is Taj Aguada Resort overlooking this beach. We arrived here late in the evening, it was dark and peaceful. You can also observe remains of lower Aguada Fort. You may visit this beach while on return from Aguada Fort."
69,Clean but costly...,"I really love visiting Sinquerim Beach. Situated right next to Aguada Fort, this beach is known not only because its beautiful, but also because of its peace and calmness. It is not one of the 'IT' beaches to visit in Goa just so that you score brownie points for showing a check-in but if you really want to enjoy a relaxed and peaceful time looking at the sunset, sitting by the shore and just observing the surroundings. Its proximity to Candolim beach is almost like walking for 10 - 20 odd minutes on the shore and you are right in midst of all the action that Goan beaches are otherwise known for! Must visit for all the nature, sunset lovers who want some time away to sit back and relax."
70,Superlative View ,"Sinquerim beach is clean beach with water sports activities like para sailing, banana boat etc. It is not very crowded and much neater than other beaches"
71,Clean n beautiful beach with shacks which provides awesome food,"The beach goes from the Fort for miles .At the fort end there are the usual tourist attractions --para sailing etc. and very popular with Indian tourists .The beach is clean and since the stranded ship has now gone ,the sand has returned and erosion at the Fort end has reversed .All along the beach are shacks and some are excellent for both lunch and dinner .For the energetic a long walk can be rewarded by an hour or two sitting in one of the shacks drinking an ice cold beer and in my case enjoying excellent chicken tikka"
72,Beautiful beach,A peaceful and clean beach on the foothill of Aguda Fort. Less crowded and thus it is clean. Not many shacks .. fish hut is one of the two shacks opened at the time of our visit. Water sports are available..
73,"Nice beach, little less crowded then Baga and Calangute","Taj Vivanta!! Makes this beach More attractive...This beach is quite clean as well as way to beach journey is enjoyable!!! To be very honest this beach's main attraction is Taj Vivanta Hotel!!! You have to go through the entire market area and Beach has a one passage to reach through Taj Vivanta!!! So Journey towards Sinquerim is nice rather than a beach, hence average ratings to the beach"
74,Small but very popular beach,This beach almost gives a feeling of a private beach as it is easiest accessible through the Taj Holiday village and Taj Fort Aguada. Sea can be quite rough on this beach during monsoons.
75,a nice Long Beach,"Sinquerim Beach is around 13 kms from panjim and it is in southern most point of the calangute. this among the best beaches of goa. if you want a soothing atmosphere and wanna spend some hours at the beach witnessing the beauty of Goa then you definitely need to visit Sinquerim Beach. its very beautiful, less crowded, clean and filled with scenic beauty. the beach is underrated, it is on the banks of Hotel Taj, Aguada. its very mesmerising to watch sunset there."
76,Pleasant,beach is less crowded and clean.. it is great if you are staying at taj which is near the beach so that you can go for a early morning long walk with your partner
77,Mesmerizing view,"This beach is not crowded. Good for water sports. The waves are also not big compared to the Calangute beach. We went for parasailing here and was a very nice experience. There is also a small fort which is next to the beach. This is very near to Aguada fort, you can visit this place along with Aguada if you are interested in visiting forts."
78,Skipable  Beach.,Visited Sinquerim beach as stayed at Taj Aguada Fort Resorts and Spa .The entry to beach from Hotel is like private beach with clean sand and little crowd.The view from small fort like structure adjoining the hotel is great for photo shoots.Life gaurd was very strict with red flags as during monsoon season high tides were to be seen throughout our stay.Few stray dogs were not a pleasant site.Beach side sports and eating joints were closed during monsoon season
79,"Clean, Quiet and has the most reliable water sports","Sinquerim beach is a small beach located at the southern most point of the Calangute, Goa. Many water sports tour operators who operate from this beach woo tourists into taking rides on jet ski's, dolphin sightings and paragliding. The beach has some of the largest resorts in Goa and is well connected."
80,Clean and safe,"Clean, beautiful and serene beach. Perfect place to unwind with family and friends. Must visit by all in Goa."
81,Peaceful place to sit and look at the stars in the sky,"The beach is beautiful and much less crowded (not private) than the other touristy beaches of Goa. Water sports are avaiable at one corner of the beach, when walk towards Aguada resort"
82,One of the finest beaches of Goa,Very accessible from Taj properties. Nice place to relax. Has a decent shack as well. It is open all through the year. Can go on nice long walk. Beach has steep slope. So not very ideal to go in the water.
83,Small is always beautiful!!,Very clean beach and moderately crowded place but still can enjoy to the fullest. Many hotels are also present offering different cuisines.
84,Nice beach after lot's of search,It is very cool and peaceful beach. You can enjoy some water sports. Beds are also available very near to beach with paying.
85,Two lovely Shacks,The little fort is here is def my favourite place to spend evenings in Goa. The views are splendidly beautiful. You feel the waves so high hit the fort and leave the spray splashing on you. Definitely my favourite place in Goa. And being a Goan myself that definitely counts ;)
86,Blue Blue Lovely Blue water !!!!,Found this beach to be extremely crowded . Beaches are much better further south. However many good restos and bars on this beach.
87,Clear water beach,Sinquerim Beach is located near Fort Aguada. This is a quite beach and the entrance of the beach is next to the entrance of Taj Resort. The beach shares itself with the boundaries of Taj. This might be one of the reasons to keep the beach clean (Am not sure). This beach offers water sports or activities as well. There is also a Fort/Watch tower structure in the beach which adds on to the beauty of the beach.
88,Crowded most of the time,A very beautiful and as good as a private beach which is quite clean. Lot of water sports are also available but not during monsoon.
89,Good beach,"This beach is somewhat less crowded (have gone there only during monsoon/off season).Sea was pretty rough wen we visited.The stretch near to the fort was pretty dirty. This place requires some cleaning to make it a good destination.+ Point: But if you get to view from the fort/structure, the view of the sea and beach  are beautiful and you will definitely love to click pics from these views."
90,Peaceful,This beach is nice quite and away from crowd.. very scenic. Went in rains so the view was extremely beautiful.
91,Great,Quiet and peaceful. Clean waters. Water-sports available. White soft sands and the Sinquerim fort at the end makes a picturesque setting.
92,Calm and Clean Beach,"One of the stunning beach of North Goa - Super clean and less crowded, noticed few water sports activities were ongoing like JetSki, Banana Rides,  ParaSailing,  Speed Boats etc.  You can park your vehicles near Taj and walk down for few mins to enjoy the beautiful view of this beach. Munchies like corn, tea,  carapace etc was available in stalls outside the beach. Must visit if you are in North Goa. Best location for all photography lovers too."
93,Amazing beach specially in high tide,"This is a beach attached to the Taj resorts but also accessible to public. The parts of the beach close to the resort are sort of maintained by Taj, so its quite clean. The vibe of the beach is good and so is the vibe of the crowd there.Parking is a bit tricky, and the road to access the beach is narrow and can get into traffic jams."
94,Morning jog,It is one of the best beach to visit there you will find fort as well as beach surrounded by coconut trees. You can also enjoy slow tide hitting the fort walls. You will see the old and strong architecutre and its beauty. You can also enjoy the beach there. Beaches are very clean. Try to go there early ae the route to the beach is narrow and only two vehicle can pass at once. If you want to enjoy the beach go in month of sept as crowd will not be there but at the same time you will not find any vendor so try to go there with your beach cloths.
95,Clean and less crowded,"Sinquerim beach is very close to Candolim beach but is less crowded and is very clean . One can enjoy water sports - Para sailing, surfing, water skiing, water scooter ride etc. Few shacks will offer freshly cooked  fish n beer to soothe your taste buds."
96,Must visit beach!!,beach is full of water sport activity less crowded and best for sunset view...beach is long enough for hrs of walk...
97,Beautiful & calm,Lovely beach for family time. It is clean and there are a lot of sea activities too. the restaurants on the beach are a must try.
98,Peaceful and Clean Beach,Sinquerim beach is very good for rides experience. Good crowds here. Boat rides available here and we done that.
99,One of the cleanest beach,"One of the best beaches in Goa where one can enjoy water-skiing, para-sailing, fishing, scuba diving and windsurfing. Somewhat Parking problem is there at this beach."
100,A peaceful sporty beach,This beach is closest to Fort Aguada and you can enjoy the rhythms of sea water at any time if your are staying at Taj. This beach attracts most shacks and water sports during peak season.
101,Tranquil,"We were staying at the Taj on this beach. The beach is lovely, water's not deep and very welcoming. Great place to take extended sea-baths and to ride those beautiful waves. The beach is dotted with tiny shacks and shanties offering delectable food, a good selection of beer and unparalleled views of the beach. You can, if you so choose, sit on a recliner on the beach while having food, the waves lapping at your feet. Lots of activities to do on the beach too. One word - Marvelous."
102,Simply clean and pristine! ,This was supposed to be a good place to visit. This is home to luxury resort by Taj. Property by taj looks real beauty. Beach now is not v clean. Not in my list of must visits Goa.
103,Less crowded beach ,"A very clean beach and safe for families.  A large portion of this beach, starting from Taj Fort Aguada, is owned by Taj.  Hence, the general upkeep of the beach is good.  Special mention of the Lifeguard team that keeps monitoring the beach during duty hours (before sundown).   Water sports available.  There are a lot of beautiful beach shacks (i.e. bar & restaurants) that also have deck chairs laid outdoors for sunbathing/general lounging.  However, you need to order something from the shack or pay a fee to use these chairs.  Went for my morning runs barefooted on the beach, much recommended!"
104,"Water Sports, Beach & A Fort- Thats what we needed.!",This is a must visit when in Goa. Great views for photos. View is gopd from both top and at the beach as well.
105,rough sea,"its a beautiful and calm beach. unlike the commercialized beaches like Baga , this is little far and nice place to visit."
106,Clean and quite beach in North Goa,"We visited this beach when we were staying in Candolim area. It is one of the best beaches as it is clean, less crowded, multiple food options  (Shacks), amazing water sports and the big plus is the overlooking fort which bisects the shoreline into two. This is the place for people traveling in groups or families wherein everybody wants to do their thing and since it is less crowded there is hardly any waiting time for the rides. You can see people enjoying water sports, taking a walk on the beach, enjoying great food at shacks or even reading a book in peace.  This beach is the perfect mix of things one needs to spend an entire day chilling and enjoy the sunset..Just a word of caution please check with the sack owners for the situation of Jelly Fish in the water as in some seasons there is more Jelly fish in the water and that is considered to be not a good time to take a dip in this beach."
107,Super relaxing-neat-not much crowded,We were staying in Taj fort aguada which is by the side of this beach.Large no of people come here to  see fort aguada and to take pictures.Beach was not very clean as lot of garbage lay there.The staircase leading to beach is in miserable state.
108,Nice beach,"Visited this beach at candolim in first wk.of Nov.Candolim is nearly 17 kms from Panjim nd nearly 45 kms from Airport at Debolim. it is a beautiful beach. Very clean. Not crowded. peaceful area. Good number of foreign tourists visit this beach.shaks at this beach are well maintained . behavior of shaks walas better then calangute beach.We enjoyed sea nd sun at this beach sitting in shaks for long hours.khana penna in these shakes quite good at reasonable cost. Water sports like jet scooter, sailing etc available at this beach."
109,Clean,This is one of the most beautiful beaches in Goa and is definitely worth visiting with friends or alone for a good time
110,clean white sandy beach but not safe fro swim,"Been there while returning from Agoda Fort. Expectation was low because the beach near the densely populated area are not recommended. But to our surprise this beach was far superior than many famous beaches of that area in terms of beauty, cleanliness & location as well.Lot of option for water sports at affordable prices."
111,Combination of flat beach and fort,Great place absolutely peaceful and calm and the place is absolutely clean and the natural beauty is beyond par
112,Peaceful place !!,This beach is less popular compared to other beaches probably because of its less accessibility but provides awesome views. You have the waves crashing against the rocks and fort making for a magnificent view. You can also reach this beach through the public transport bus that runs throughout North Goa
113,Peaceful beach ,"Guys do visit on one hand it’s Taj Holiday & on other hand Taj Aguada Resort both properties are beautiful & in center is Sinquerim beach, Awesome beach, clean & high tides in Monsoon.  Must visit place in Goa."
114,"Some sun, less people, a few friendly stray dogs and lots of sand & fun","The beach is very close to the Fort Aguada. The waves breaking in this beach are bigger. During high tides, water from the waves even drench tourists inside the fort. The beach is not very clean as many tourists throng this place. Not too many shacks are there on this beach."
115,clean beach,"This is lower deck of Agauda fort, so cool and breezing beach, beware of sea as waves are stormy at times."
116,Palm fringed beach,One of the good beach can find in Goa. Been spent good amount of time and it was fun being here. Enjoyed the time off.
117,Clean n Serene,"Well, after visiting Fort Aguada and returning to Baga there is straight road end to Sinquerim beach. This beach is in front of Hotel Taj Vivanta with excellent scenic view. It's white sand beach with many sports activities like banana ride, parasailing, speedboat etc."
118,lovely beach near the fort,"Located just around 13 km from the capital city of Panaji, Sinquerim is considered the first tourist beach in North Goa. The beautiful beach lies south of other famous North Goan beaches like Candolim, Calangute and Baga. You can spend hours hear lying on the soft sand, swimming in the ocean water or going windsurfing, scuba diving, fishing, water skiing and parasailing. If you are visiting Goa for the first time, Sinquerim Beach is a good place to head to for a good time."
119,Awesome beach,"I would Suggest who are visiting Aguada Fort, it is good to visit this beach.This beach is very calm and well maintained. Crowd will be moderate and you can enjoy in water for a longer time along with your beloved ones or Family. As there will be high tide, it is good to have more fun while playing in Water.If you are a photo lover, stay till Sunset and capture a best view. as there will be Tide crashing aFort wall which gives a nice pic for water fall.There are few Water sports activity like Scooter Boat, Ship, etc.A view behind the Beach is really Awsome, occupied by  the Hotels.One of the India's best hotel Taj Vivanta is be situated over here. The vie of the Hotel after SunSet is really Superb.There are open Parking Space on the Road Side, in Peak season it will bedifficult to find a Parking Space."
120,Nice,As far as Goa beaches this is one of the best and cleanest would definately come back here.Only downside is a lot of stray dogs frequent it in the evenings
121,Excellent beach,It's another beautiful beach of Goa. We walked for miles on the clean golden sand early one morning .It felt so fresh and exhilarating!!
122,WOWsome beach!,The beach has Taj hotel on its Bank . the entry to the gate is narrow and you have to climb down the stairs to reach this beach.The beach is beautiful with palm trees and hotels on one side and open sky on the other side.
123,One of the best attractions in Goa,"Very nice, clean and not at all crowded beach. From here Dolphin view ride is there, but this is not a good idea to book from here."
124,One of the better beaches in Goa,"Located beside Taj Fort Aguada, the Sinquerim beach has a couple of shacks, water sports and a quiet beach front. It's perfect for early morning run or walk because you won't see any bottles or garbage strewn around"
125,Great open sandy beach by Taj Village hotel,astounding view and clean beach along with cold and clean water just doubles the pleasure of visiting goa
126,A calm place to enjoy the sea,Having a great time in Goa visiting most of the beaches in the northern part and I found this the best one of all.
127,Water sports,a great scenic locale. the fort aguada stand on the beach and the makes a perfect picture postcard . the beach is not big but that mean less people. there are restaurants along the beach that offer great views and ok food
128,Clean bath,If you are staying at the Taj village resorts or at the Taj Aguada fort property this beach is a must visit. Very peaceful since it is mostly frequented by the hotel guests. The beach is also very clean unlike some of the other beaches in Goa these days. We visited during the end of monsoon - great time to visit but advisable to stay a little away from the waves.
129,A different view of the sea from the fort,This is really a nice beach with not many notorious people around as you may find in other north goa secluded beaches.
130,My FAVOURITE place in Goa,"It is very good beach with a lot of water sports and activities like dolphin spotting, jet ski, para gliding, banana boat ride, etcThe beach view from the fort is nostalgic.Water is clean so you can have dip.A lot of shacks to allow yourself a good drink and meal.The only problem you may face on a busy day the parking and the approach lane,there is almost no parking space, so people park on the approach lane which itself is narrow. So on a busy day it might be better to walk to the beach."
131,"This is lower deck of Agauda fort, so cool and breezing beach, beware of sea as waves are stormy at times. ",This beach which have clear water and also very less waves. At the same time it has few dangerous sections. life guards are present to have a look on those. Restaurants on this beach are much costlier but you get their shacks free.
132,A great Place to start your day,"This beach can get busy during the peak seasons, but it is relatively clean and the water was a perfect temperature  when I visited in November 2017.  Just keep an eye on your belongings when you go in for a dip, and never leave anything of value unattended.  There are lots of informal sales of goods and services (like getting massages done right on the beach) going on, and some of the vendors are slightly suspicious characters."
133,Nice beach with huge waves breaking near the shore,"Very close to taj vivanta. Clean, calm,  less crowded and ideal for morning walk. One end has remnant of Fort Aguada well kept giving beautiful view of combination of beach & rocks."
134,Beach ,The beach is a small one but right next to the sinquerim fort ruins. A very pretty picture. Plenty of fishing boats or trawlers in the sea. Many water sport options available on this beach. The famous Tony's shack is right on the beach.
135,peaceful beach,"I went to Sinquerim Beach. At Sinquerim beach you can also find water sports options such as windsurfing, jet skiing, water skiing etc. The entire stretch makes for the longest beach and also hosts some of the music festival. It is great place to go."
136,Clean Beach..a must visit when in Goa,"It is difficult to say which one is best beach but Sinqueriun  beach is less crowded in comparison to Candolim, Calangute & Baga beaches near to fort Aguada.Lovely view of the beach can be enjoyed from Taj Vivanta. Other budget tourist can go straight to beach. Tourist face parking problem here Over all a nice beach to visit."
137,NEAT CLEAN AND PEACEFUL BEACH AT THE FOOT STEP OF HOTEL FORT TAJ AGUADA,"At the end of the series of beaches from Baga to Sinquerim which is the last. Fairly crowded because of availability of water scooters, parasailing. There are 1 or two restaurants facing the beach (forget names) that offer a great view of all this. The well known hotels Taj Holiday Village and Taj Aguada beach resort also face this beach and in the distant past we have enjoyed accesing the beach from these resorts. Nowadays the crowd at the beach seems not to be the hotel guests but more the general public"
138,Clean Beach,One of the nicest beaches in Goa. Neat and not that crowded in comparison to that of Baga and Calangute. A must for nature lovers.
139,Good Rides ,"As I say, its less crowdy in comparison with other beaches in this area. Also, its scenic and gives you alot of Me-time. Just hang around a shack and unwind in Goa's aura."
140,"Nice, less crowded beach",Nice beach with good outlets around the place. Not great a Baga beach. But it’s a good place to hangout with friends and nice view and the beach colour is very blue in this place.
141,beautiful clean beach with palm tree surroundings,"A beautiful beach in Goa with clean blue water and white sand !!! If you are on a family trip searching for a beach that is not crowded , go for this one in North Goa . Its very next to TAJ resort & Fort Aguada . One end of this beach has a small fort which is built inside the sea . I have visited 5 beaches in North & 3 in South Goa . Out of all these beaches this is our favourite !!!"
142,water sports,Nice and clean beach. Just stay in hotel on beach.  Crowd also good. Water sports not available in monsoon but in September to may probably.
143,Nice Beach!,A beautiful white sand beach. Quite and relaxed . With fort aguada on one side and sea on the other. A great place to enjoy sun rise and sun set.
144,Quite clean beach,"This beach starts from the Hotel Taj Vivanta and goes on till Calangute beach via Candolim. Waters will be a bit rough in the later afternoon, with heavy winds."
145,Great Beach,Sea itself is very warm but we had questions about its cleanliness. The beach itself is clean but can be full on weekends with alot of watersport activity nearby. Night use is difficult as there are many wild dogs on the prowl who've been known to attack people.
146,Quiet,"Sinquerim is a nice small beach, which generally is not very crowded. Does not have too many shacks... has just 2 of them. But it is a beautiful and calm place."
147,Great beach...cool shacks,This beach have many options for water sports and i worth to visit beach is beautiful n calm nice options for hangout also have a chilled bear n fell the cool breeze from the sea in hot afternoon...
148,"Good beach, not too crowded",Super clean and uncrowded beach! The water is crystal clear and it slopes down very gently meaning it's quite safe to go into the water!
149,Clean and good sand ,"This is a wonderful place for discovering ""Educated looking"" person scribbling on Sinquerim fort walls. Have a look at this pic below.Sinquerim fort has an amazing Aura.. Try to visit it before sunrise!!.. The gush of waves can easily make one nostalgic.."
150,Slipper,"I stayed at hotel Fort Taj Aguada and Senquerium beach is just at it foot step  Senqurium fort is nearby ,which adds a further charm .The beach is very neat clean and serene .It is less crowded and wave are smooth.one can take pleasant bath without rough waves ,just ripple of waves touching the body.This beach merges with the Candolim beach on its north side.I had morning and evening walk at this beach which was very pleasant experience..In the evening I saw many young lads playing volleyball. I also joined them and enjoyed the game and beach sand.and sea. Water sports activity is also very good.Few very good beach side restaurents which serve tasty  disces  ."
151,Sink or swim,One of the best beach! Scenic and clean. Less crowded compared to rest of the beaches I visited. A must visit especially at sunset. The beach walk during sunset will give you the best feeling <3 <3
152,Clean and we felt safe at all times,"A lovely beach just besides the Hotel Taj Fort Aguada, where we stayed. Very clean, quiet and peaceful beach. Strongly recommended if you want to stay away from the crowds without travelling to far north or south."
153,Overall Good Beach ,Sinquerim Beach is close to fort aguada and last one in Canlangute-Baga stretch close to Candolim. Beach is relaxing and lesser crowd compare to any other beach till Anjuna. Few Shacks and relatively less lively.
154,Beautiful ,"i love this beach because it is very quite and sea is quite calm there, and food in shacks you get there too and all drinks you want or fancy,just lovely beach ,"
155,Amazing view from the top of the Aquada fort hill,Now in North goa this is the only place where I would love to spend my whole day clean beach few people that too foreigners genuine priced food good place too enjoy beach and sand
156,Sinquerim beach,A very good beach and has a host of water sports and activities. A must visit beach in NorthGoa. It’s just adjacent to Fort Aguada and one can visit this along with the Fort.
157,Nice Beach,Very clean nice place . the view point is very nice . You can enjoy watching the waves.A must visit beach
158,Pristine,This beach offers you a calm place to relax...there is very less crowd in this beach most of the time and thats what makes it serene. Star gazing at night on the empty beach beds is a must do...unlike other more popular beaches like Baga and Calangute where they charge exorbitantly even for beach beds like rs 500 or so !
159,Clean Beach,"A lovely beach which we only found at the end of our 2 week holiday. We visited Calungute & Candolim which were so busy & overcrowded. We visited beginning of October, so slightly out of season for the main tourists & beach huts were only just being set up. Saying that this beautiful, calm, quiet beach was such a contrast to the others. If you like it mad & overcrowded then go for the others but for tranquility & peace stick to Singuerim Beach, you won't be disappointed. It's gorgeous!"
160,Lovely beach,"This beach is very clean,  you can take a walk or splash around.  The watersports are well priced.  They have a few nice shacks!  Bon appetit and calamari were my favourite for dusk Timings.  Lots of guys giving foot massages and they are quite good too."
161,SINQUERIM BEACH,It is a very nice Long Beach and therefore not crowded. There are lot of shacks würde one can have a meal or a drink.We were there couple of weeks ago and we were quite disoppointed with the water quality. There were some Jelly fish swimming very close to the Strand.
162,Clean beach ,"The beach is clean and crowded. Water activities like parasailing, jet ski, banana ride are also available. Beach also has some popular shacks like Tony's shack."
163,Goa unravels peace.,"The beach is a fab one among all i visited, its close to Fort aguada so it takes just 10 mins drive from there, the views is amazing and beach is clean with very few shacks for relaxing.Water is clean in this side."
164,Is there a competition?,We visited this beach just after the cyclone hit Goa and found only a few shack left on the beach. The beach itself is lovely and long and you can get lost in it. Leading up to the beach was quite busy with little stalls selling food/drinks and lots of motorbikes/scooters. The first shack was very busy with mainly Russian visitors but the next couple were English and other countries. There were a few beach sellers but nothing to worry about. It certainly didn't spoil my visit and we returned a few days later to spend a lazy day on the beach.
165,Rapidly becoming Benidorm,"Nice to take bath in the Beach and lot of activities exist in the beach like parasailing,  boating and water scooter"
166,Less crowded one,Huge waves High tides not suitable for swim during AugustBut u can't miss this. There is a fort too. Photogenic view also
167,Lovely beach.,"Even in the monsoon months, this beach retains its accessibility albeit with embargos on entering slightly deeper in water n water sports etc. still if you want to/ have come for those long walks on the beach with little or no one disturbance, this is the place to be. My fav time - early morning pre 6am"
168,Goa Off Season,"Arrive at this beach via the road alongside Taj Fort Aguada Resort & Spa and take a flight of stairs to this calm beach where you can enjoy the beach and the gentle waves. I am sure there may be times when the waves become enormous. However, the day I visited I was able to enjoy the waves along with my five year old daughter who didn't want to leave the beach and enjoy some more. The beach is clean and the lifeguards are attentive. I nice place to hangout especially in the evenings (I visited in the afternoon which was a bad time but we enjoyed nevertheless)."
169,"Nice, clean & not crowded","Sinquerim is far from maddening crowds, the beach is cleaner, sand is softer and the the view of the sunset here is our favorite in all of Goa. There are water sports activities here and some good shacks in high season. If you enjoy your barefoot beach walks like us, the Calamari shack, which in our view is the best in Goa, is a lazy 10 mins walk away as Sinquerim merges into Candolim."
170,Not a Famous one...,This is a must visit beach and the small view point (the fort) if you happen to visit the Aguada fort area. Don't miss it if you go to Aguada fort. The beach is really clean white sand beach compared to other north Goa beaches.  The small view point is built in such a way the you happen to walk inside the sea area a few meters. So from there you get to see the sea waves moving away from you!! The view is worth seeing as we are always used to see the waves moving towards us from the shore :)The road leading to this beach is narrow and you need to careful if you drive on your own.
171,"Small, nice and clean beach",This is a very long and gorgeons beach for taking great walks.  We appreciated that at this time of year this beach wasn't crowded.  We did notice many stray dogs and one nipped at my husband's leg as we passed.  This was totally unprovoked and we never engaged with these dogs.  We noticed that some beach walkers carried sticks with them.
172,Wondering where the heaven is?? its in GOA at Sinquerim,"This beach is just next to Vivanta , Its beacutiful ,The way to the beach is very narrow so most of the people go by walk or 2 wheeler."
173,"Average Beach, good for photography",It have small fort type n beach too.. It's a best beach to get swim. Tides are less n also safe.. Sand is little dark n tight so less chance to get die in beach water. Here u can have some great food too like bhutta n 🍍
174,Nice beach to relax and chill out,A place worth seeing once when you are in Goa. They charge about 300 for a boat ride where the boat takes you in middle of ocean to see dolphins. If you are lucky then you will see few. We were in luck to see mesmerising dolphins playing in the ocean.
175,Water sports ,Want to spend some good time without crowd at North Goa then you should definitely spend it on this beach. This is after the candolim beach and a decent one. Taj has it's property here so they have tried to keep it clean.
176,Clean and safe!,"Find few good viewpoints for photography here, rest is ok only. Don't expect good sitting place and food here."
177,The quite end of Candolim ,It's a sun trap and ideal for playing in the Arabian sea. We stayed adjacent to the beach and loved the short walk from hotel steps past people and families of all ages to the fish hut beach bar.
178,Visited after the cyclone hit,This is a nice beach. Small but therefore also uncrowded and clean. Good for a morning and evening walk and run
179,Senquerim Fort,"We stayed at the Taj hotel located next to this beach. You can walk for miles and there are loads of beach shacks to stop off at.There were quite a few dogs and cows on the beach. Although they did not bother us.The beach is not impeccibly clean but certainly not a dirty beach. People leave their litter and expect others to clean up. We did see staff walking up and down collecting rubbish.We were there early November. The sea was warm and the shacks were all open for busy. I believe early November is the start of the season. I was unlucky to be stung by a jelly fish, but there were loads of people in the water who weren't.Plenty of water sports to keep you entertained. Located by thd Taj hotel, and fort wall.Overall a good beach and would return."
180,"Good crowd, quaint waves","From Calamari to the Taj, what a beautiful beach, especially after that eyesore of a ship has been removed.The beach cleaners are wonderful & they really make a difference but there is so much dog pooh around, especially half way down, so be very careful. Don't walk barefoot- lots of broken glass too.I do wish someone would get rid of these flea bitten dogs."
181,Calm beach,"This beach is wonderful because there are no crowds of people, you can just walk along the tide line relaxing in the sunshine without getting hassled"
182,Clean and Nice one,"Accessible from Taj Holiday village and Taj Aguada, with very few other beachfront restaurants, the beach is almost secluded and hence less crowded. There are water sports facilities available here which are slightly more costlier than other popular beaches. But the crowd is great , so no hard feelings."
183,Serene beach just next to Ford Aguada! ,The place is nice and can spend time during less summer.The look is good and nice place to visit.The beach is nice.
184,Nice beach,"Absolutely beautiful beach, TAJ folks have a keen eye for the places they select to put up their properties and hats off to this selection. Never ending beach front with beautiful views from the fort side. Only if you are staying at the Taj Aguada, you may want to go back to your room or else you may just continue lingering on the beach side, playing in the waves especially if you are with your kids."
185,Lovely beach,"Baga n Calangute are crowded beaches and the crowd is also bit too much, if are looking for doing nice water sports go to sinquerium beach its clean, the crowd is mostly of foreigners and lately you can go n check out taj property for drinks it near the beach side"
186,Scenic Beauty,"This one ia clean, long of course, has some good shacks but beware of the people selling water activities - they're way more expensive than the other beaches. But then it is much cleaner than the others too."
187,"A beautiful, less crowded beach. Best for water sports.","This beach is very good if you really want to enjoy, with shacks around you can relax here from sunrise to sunset."
188,Nice beach,"Not a very clean beach , mostly deserted and very close to the Taj hotels. Parking can be an issue as the approaching road towards this beach is very narrow."
189,Excellent beach with the cleanest of golden sand,"Whole beach is clean n tidy. Good for kids. Food service at shacks is good. Fish fingers was our favourite. U can find beautiful 🐚 n if u r lucky then u can see starfish, hermit crabs. We found hermit crabs, small prawns n beautiful tatooted shells. Water sports r also available on this beach. Not so much crowded. Lifeguards r also available here. We had lunch at Ram's shack who also provide us sittings near beach. So it's an wonderful experience to have lunch on beach listening to beautiful music of waves n offcourse with a great view.Thanks"
190,Less crowdy beach,Great if you're into adventure sports. The beach was not too crowded. There is a a Taj hotel property which is maintained very well and the entire beach has a luxury feel to it.
191,Get relaxed get scenic views,"This is a very small stretch of beach compared to nearby Candolim and Calangute, but we preferred it as it is more peaceful."
192,Nice and quiet,Nice beach. You Can do here some water .. you can see here nice look of  blue sea.. this place is wonderful for all.
193,Peaceful,We had a private access to this beach which was a great timesaver. it was very very less crowded as compared to our last visit in december. Very nice for a jog or to play.take care of being barefoot due to small jellyfish??
194,Beach at your feet,"By far one of the best beaches I have visited. Clean, safe, not much non-sense, wonderful powdery sand and good shacks to chill out at."
195,Harmful fishes like stingray and jelly fish in beach,"3.5 Star for Beach1 Star for Water Sport ActivitiesBeach is adjacent to Fort (Lower aguada Fort/Sinquerim Fort) Disappointed with Water Sport Activity as activity can be carried by couples only.If you are single avoid water Sport Activity here , also boat driver keep on asking for Long ride for extra money totally got ripped off. Jet ski ride for couple - Stay away.Overall avoid Water Sport Activity at Sinquerim beach , Good beach for visit."
196,A beach with a fort ,"Sinquerim Beach is quite decent. It's kept clean and is perfectly decent for swimming (though there are dumper waves which require a degree of caution). The most unique thing about the beach are the Portuguese-era fortifications at the far end, including a rounded bastions which projects out towards the ocean waves."
197,Beach with lot of activities ,"Small yet popular and clean beach with dolphin spotting trips, shacks with decent food and chilled beer and the Sinquerium Fort overlooking the sea. It also has a lot of resorts like Taj Vivanta and Taj Holiday village resorts nearby. Sinquerium beach is located 13 km north of Panaji.the capital city of Goa is the Sinquerium Beach. Not very famous and that is why I have chosen it as one of the places where you can just run away from the crowd and just be yourself. Near this beach is the most famous Aguada a Portuguese Fort that was built in the earlier days to defend attack from the sea route.If you love water sports this is the one beach where you should be and not miss it for the world on your trip to Goa. Although it does get a little crowded during season time due to tourists visiting the Aguada Fort, it is quieter and peaceful on the other days of the year and should be visited."
198,"Busy with Tourists, but Pretty Beach in Goa",My driver suggested to go there and it turns out to be one of cleanest and calm beach i have seen . and i have seen a lot . you can hire a beach frond bed for day and enjoy swim in nice calm water
199,Sea water is warm,"One of the beaches that should definitely be on Your goa bucketlist. Top attractions for this beach:-> Perfect sunset spot (better than thalasa). The sea becomes glimpse of dark grey and green .. A perfect sight to behold at sunset.-> Affordable water sports (specially parasailing where you don't have to pay extra for dipping your feet in sea unlike water sports in baga and calangute beach). We did Parasailing, jet ski and bumping for Rs 1000 only per person.-> The beach is overlooked by Taj vivanta and the view is breath taking.-> There is a perfect food shack where the food is perfect and you can enjoy the sunset. (we incurred only Rs 900 for total of 5 people). Try mushroom red pasta for sure over there.-> Fort Aguada is close to this beach (approx 10 mins) on scooty. So You can have our whole day spent at these locations."
200,Good beach for those staying at fort aguarda,"It offers a lot beach activities, less crowded. A calm, quite, place. good for honeymooners , need to visit in hot seasons, good sunset view."
201,Water Sport activity,They take you for 1hr Dolphine Boat Ride + some nearby places to see while in boat. We were not lucky to see any Dolphine. But Yes Average day time place to spend some good time with friends and Family.
202,nice one....,We strayed at the Taj hotel and found Sinquerim Beach very pleasant compared to Candolim beach where we normally stay. There is more space around your sun beds and quieter overall. The fort is a great view along the horizon.
203,Nice beach,Nice beach.. Has a lot of options for water sports and activities... If you walk Lil further.. U can find Lil calm place to sit or enjoy with family and friends
204,Beautiful beach.,"This place actually more like private beach with very few, shacks and chopping huts. Secluded, clean and beautiful"
205,The sunset beach..,It is very peaceful here as not too many people visit this place. It was infact quite clean as compared to many other beaches in Goa. One can just sit there and have sun bath and feel relaxed.
206,Quite and calm,"Beautiful beach, very clean, with great shacks with delicious food and drinks. Perfect for rest and relaxation"
207,Beach closest to Taj properties in North Goa,Nice beach and less crowd that's what i prefer :) Good variety of shacks and water sports option also available ..
208,Longest Beach,"This gorgeous beach with fine sand and a part of the fort on one end makes up for a gorgeous sunset spectacle. The food stalls in the parking serve a range of delicious street food. The sparsely crowded beach makes up for a beautiful setting for water sports, even though the water sports cost a little more than on other beaches. There are a couple of decent shacks to grab your beers and seafood."
209,Better looking beach in Goa,"This is really a very beautiful beach with great scenery. You can take so many photos. Also there are so many professional photographers roaming there so you can take their photography advantage also. The biggest plus point for this beach is it has water sports options & that too with affordable cost compare to other beaches. So all in all a must visit beach for family, couples, friends."
210,Clean quiet beach,"Beautiful clean beach with beach shacks all, no litter, no bad smell... no nonsense, very safe for children."
211,Water sports,pretty clean beach. good crowd. lots of water sports and activities. went for para sailing and it was pretty good. lots of restaurants and shacks along the beach offer a great sea view.
212,Good Beach ! great water sports !,Stunning to look at and great for walking but didn't fancy swimming due to pollution.   At high tide lot of plastic waste etc is swept onto the beach.
213,Beautiful Scenic beach,"Accessible and a good walk from the hotel. Safe and secured. Be mindful of the tide, monsoons are rough, swim is not advisable."
214,A long beach with soft sand,"Probably the quietest beach between Calangute, Candolim and Sinquerim. The sand was still laden with rubbish from domestic Indian tourists but the shacks were quieter. Loads of stray dogs roaming the beaches and quite aggressive."
215,Beautiful and peaceful,"Sinquerim Beach was right outside our hotel property. It was less crowded, clean and had loads of Water sports options"
216,Decently located beach near Aguada Fort,"Dolphin watching trips are very popular in Goa. We are lucky to catch glimpses of dolphins.You will grab hold of one of the many boats-for-hire for a bit of dolphin spotting.Rates differ from season to season. Along the way you’ll also get to see Coco Beach, Fort Aguada Jail and Jimmy Millionaire’s {Parsi entrepreneur Jimmy Gazdar} house, where many movies has been shooted. one time watch place.."
217,Good clean beach,"Sinquerim beach is quieter than Candolim and a lot quieter than Calangute and Baga beaches. There are some nice shacks, especially Ganesh shack. Lovely soft sand."
218,Nice secenic beach,"The beach and fort is just fine, if you have nothing else to do, there are better beaches in Goa to explore."
219,Decent place to visit,"Beach was lovely and sandy, however dont attempt it bare footed as the sand was BOILING! beach is relatively clean with several food shacks to pick from."
220,A beautiful beach ,Its a clean beach..Nice to get some foot massages done..Around 400 to 500 they charge..Good for hair braiding 150 rupee...Some nice shacks including Calamari...Our favourite... Greek looking..Awesome food.
221,Clean & Beautiful,The beach itself is very clean and not so touristy. If you are looking for watersports in the north of Goa then head out here.
222,good chill spot,"we did water sport activity in this beach  i.e parasailing & speed boat & it was so thrilling& we enjoyed a lot .My suggestion is to stay near to beach which is less crowded in North goa (viz Arambol(we stayed here),Kerim etc)& come down to Sinquerim/Calangute/Baga which 30-40Km from above places& do the water sport activity.Stay one or two of days in old goa(panjim etc(v stayed in colva-south goa,hence the suggestion which saves lot of time for you )) & visit Bom basalica Jesus ,Mangeshi temple etc"
223,Excellent Place to walk around,A short bus ride from candolim and 10 rupees later coupled with a short walk and you are there.Palm tree lined beach next to fort aguada with a great restaurant for lunch called bon appetit.You do pay for sunbeds but who cares!Tranquil and peaceful for a quiet day away from the beach sellers further North in Candolim and Calangute
224,Serene beach,"It is one of the finest beach pick up point for adventure sports. There are several agencies offering you a ride to Monkey beach, where you can take a dive in the middle of sea with life jackets on. Whether you swimming or not it is wonderful to spend some time in the middle of sea floating. The one hour boat ride from Sinquerim beach to Monkey island is exciting. You can also see dolphins on the way. After the ride you are taken to an island for lunch and games.Tickets are sold both online and offline. Buying tickets directly cost Rs.1,500 per head. It include food unlimited beer and soft drinks. Online ticket costs 500 rs extra including GST. You can also do some underwater bathing. Never miss it"
225,a 16th centruy fort overlooking the beach. 5* view,"It's a clean, beautiful and peaceful place. We visited in the evening. As such no changing rooms available nearby. Some hotels / restorant offering good tea / snacks."
226,Less popular but awesome views!!,"Great beach and lovely sunset view. Just take a your evening snacks, few cool drinks and music and find a great place to sit and relax for hours"
227,Sinquerim beach,"Most people who visit the beach probably end up there because they come to check out the Aguada fort. The beach itself doesn't have much going on for it, it's a flat sandy beach. There are more scenic beaches up north and I wouldn't come down here to enjoy the beach also because that water doesn't really appear to be very clean."
228,Leisure trip,"Love the beach. Its s private beach wre we can spend quality  of time ,clean ,water sports amazing. Jus loved it"
229,Taj Vivanta!! Makes this beach More attractive,"Sinquerim beach is a beautiful and a much cleaner beach. Yes,it is definitely much less crowded than calangute n Baga beach and perhaps that's why more preserved. It makes for a beautiful post card picture kind of beach. There is a key shape kind of spot on the beach where you can get some amazing clicks. N yess u have water sports too. Infact there were quite a few people doing watersports here and I think it's a good idea since it's very very crowded at calangute n Baga and thus often u have a waiting time.There are some amazing shacks too. I think it's a must visit place if u are looking for relaxation and tranquility."
230,Best beach,"We were staying at Taj Aguada and so got to enjoy the beach as Taj has steps that take you down to the beach. The beach is clean, not crowded and has good views. Lovely sunset with the Aguada fort as a backdrop. It is not commercialized like some of the more popular beaches and we liked it that way. It has nice food shacks as well as steps going up to both the Taj properties. Water sports are available. My husband liked to go for a run on the beach in the morning. We enjoyed going for walks on the beach at different times of the day. It is not an over crowded beach and we loved it. We found we could relax and enjoy the scenic beauty here."
231,Cleanest and favorite beach in central north,We visited the place in evining n it was mud changing. Such a nice surrounding n gud sitting and sport activities. Must visit the same
232,Less crowded beach,"Went during the rains,it wasn't pristine,found it always crowded with tourist.Good for walking as the sand is hard.Rubbish lying around.May be a better season ,or a tide,can change the face and feel of the beach."
233,Excellent beach!,Good beach near Aguada fort. Luckily got a decent deal on Jet Ski ride here. Was a good experience and fun at this beach.
234,Nice beach,Went for an early morning walk/jog.Cool breeze was so refreshing and the beach was almost crowd free. No major shacks till mid october mainly because of the storm alert. All in all sinquerim beach is at no. 2 9n my goa beach list.
235,"Average, less crowded but dirty",We visited here on 2/6/19.The beautiful fort attract ed us.We went to beach.We did pyra sailing.They take 2000rs for two persons.The take us to the sailing point by boat.It was awesome experience.Aftrr pyrasailing they offered a jumping into the sea .That is 200rsbper person We did that also.But check lifejackets first.The beach is clean.Banana boat jump also here.It was must see point in Goa.
236,Goa Trip 2016,A good beach to have fun and spend some time with children or spouse. Less crowded but less visited as everyone can not visit all beaches of Goa
237,"A once clean pristine beach, now destroyed with broken bottles and pollution",Just stunning.  Lovely beach. Great sun beds. Nice clean beach. Unlike some in the area. Just what I hough a beach in India would look like Worth the little trip to it
238,Nice,"Not at all crowded, and well maintained too. Has a lot of water sports as well. Right next to Taj so mostly just the hotel crowd here."
239,Nice quite serene clean beach next to taj,"well worth to spend time at this beautiful beach,,,as the waves roll in u can feel the sand move beneath your feet....locals have told us to be careful of this...as recently they have experienced this happening around the coast..."
240,beautiful beach,Goa beaches have become extremely dirty. I would say this one is better. I would say this is cleaner and has some interesting water sports. The dolphin sightings in the morning are good.
241,Very good beach-has a great view point,"We had a good time at Sinquerium beach, this is inline to the Aguada Fort, we first visited the fort in the morning and then we headed for this beach. There are many beach shacks, but we preferred eating near the parking area, there was local maggi guy and other local options, from the parking area we enjoyed the view while eating. Overall a great day to remember."
242,Sereeene,"nothing special, literally normal beach clean and chill. watch out for the dogs keep a stick handy. cows might be present as well"
243,Must visit in north goa,if you like to be away from hustle bustle then this beach is the one. less crowded. can find water sports activities too.
244,Accessible and a good walk from the hotel,Our hotel had direct access to the beach and hence we were able to go quiet often. Can spot the fishing boats in the morning hours... quiet a beautiful sight.
245,Beautiful beach,"I spent 3 days in Goa for beach sightseeing. I hired a car at the rate of INR 2200 per day recommended by my hotel (Raikar Guest House) owner from Bogmalo near Airport. Normal charges are 2500/- per day. By the grace of God I was very lucky to have an excellent host as well as driver with me.

The beach is neat clean with white sand & long. Those who cherish long walk on the beach this is the one for them. On one side Aguada fort is located & other side Beach Resorts. The portion of Aguada fort divides the beach. Resorts have nice greenery. In the evening the beach provides a nice view for sunset.You will find following water sports at this beach at very affordable rates: Parasailing, jet ski, bump ride, banana ride, dolphin trip, speed boat trip, luxury boat ride etc.I have attached the photo of the advertisement board that displays rates for above water sports activities at this beach.  Also see the attached photos that will provide you the real feel of the place.If you are first time travelling to Goa then read below few helpful tips:Transportation system:Car hire with driver Rs. 2500 per day Car on rent for self driving Rs. 1200  per day Motorbike with driver Rs. 900 per day Motorbike on rent for self driving Rs.400 per dayThe things I felt nice about Goa are:Neat & clean beachesLess population of public & trafficThose who are fond of drinking. Goa is a heaven or paradise for them as variety of beer wine & whisky available at a very economical rates. Wish you all the best for your Goa tour."
246,Excellent view of the beach from fort walls,"It’s an ok beach, not the fine sand that you’d want but not to coarse unless you get caught unawares by the tide - the beach slopes sharply into the water and the tide can easily knock you over ... We were shocked by the amount of dog faeces with some dogs happily doing their business in front of their ‘owners’, who didn’t seem to care, even though this was right in front of the sun beds / bars that they were touting; speaking of which, you could hardly call this beach relaxing unless you enjoy being offered free sun beds/WiFi for a beer every 10 metres or so.Each to his own, it’s worth a visit if you’re local but I wouldn’t bother making any special effort to get there."
247,Excellent surrounding view,The beauty of the beach was captured just at the sunset with the Ford Aguada as the backdrop and the crimson sky and its reflection in the sea. A Kodak moment!!!!The beach is not that crowded and has only a couple of shacks. As we reached at dusk... we were unsure of the water sports available there. A short duration visit is suggestible!
248,Excellent beach ,walked along the beach a few times during a three day stay in the vicinity.  Very safe  and fairly clean beach . the water sports that included a ten minute jet ski   and para sailing was enjoyed by the family
249,Dolphin Safari,"This beach was far from our hotel but we decided to head on there as people said that you can see dolphins from some activity there. But to our disapoointment because of bad weather, we didn't got chance to see any dolphin and it was a waste of time there. So i would recommend to better go to another beaches."
250,Super Sinquerim ,"Here you can  find water sports options such as windsurfing, jet skiing, water skiing etc at competitive prices. Its the longest beach in Goa and also hosts some of the music festival. It is great place to go."
251,Nice clean beach with comparative less crowd,Its something nice and location is also good one heighted place is also ther from therepics are captured nice
252,Serenity ,"As our stay was at Fort Aguada, this beach is a stone throw's distance. Remember walking down from Candolim Beach last year and it was so clean, but this year was a sad state. Completely polluted and dangerous with broken bottles and glass shrapnel strewn across the entire length of the beach"
253,The best one!,I did not visit this beach but i have seen this from the top of light house which was so astonishing to me. Its still a virgin beach with not much crowd and i liked that
254,Better place for water sports,"What a lovely sandy beach. The water is warm and there was enough oomph in the waves to make it fun. The beach is cleaned daily and it stays pretty clean throughout the day. There are loungers with very beach bar, i don't think it was necessary to buy anything to use them but i think you should. The ones we went to were all very reasonably priced.  The beach nearest the Fort is occupied predominantly by Indians and the further you walk the more europeans there are."
255,Clear waters and long sandy beach,"it was very clean , and less crowded , we went in april all water sports were closed ,you can climb a small fort like structure to have a top view , which is really amazing in the evening , it is just beside Taj Hotel."
256,Good pleasant beach,"One of the few beaches which hasn't seen the rowdy explosion yet. Mostly frequented by foreign tourists, the beach has a full time lifeguard and a lot of shacks to satisfy your taste buds."
257,Very nice and quiet beach,"Great place to swim if the tide is right, but need to take notice of Lifeguards and safe bathing areas as can be dangerous otherwise. The beach is much more crowded further north but with plenty of beach shacks for cheap eats and drinks."
258,Fun Filled Day,Great place to roam around with your loved ones... Peaceful and lovely beach to walk. Less crowded....
259,Dirty beaches,"The Goan authorities are trying to tidy up, but it seems that the young affluent short stay visitors from Mumbai and Delhi dont take notice, and leave all sorts of rubbish on the beaches .I myself have picked up bottles, complete and broken then asked a shack if they could dispose."
260,Very GOOD Clean Beach,"The beach is calm, clean, silent and less crowded. there are so many professional photographers roaming there so you can take their photography advantage also. There are so many professional photographers roaming there so you can take their photography advantage also. Long stretch of the sea coast makes it good for a long scenic walk especially at sunset when the sun is the size of a dinner plate and has a beautiful colour!!!"
261,Less Crowded Beach in Goa,"Good to have a stroll. Have shanties to on this beach, where you can relax and spent some me time. Loved it."
262,Nice place for sunset,"As it's at the far end of the Baga - Calangute - Candolim -Sinquerim,  it's less crowded.  Walking on the soft white sand and watching the sun go down around 6:30 pm was a pleasure."
263,This beach is perfect guys!!,"If you are a water lover and do not fear it. Go in high tide, enjoy the water streams on beach. The motorboat ride can be best enjoyed on this beach."
264,What a fab walking beech,"Though there is not much night life here, perhaps proximity to Taj Augoda has made it relatively costlier for whatever water-sports fcalities are available here..."
265,Decent Beach ..less crowded than the other North Goa Options,"Romax Shack is located on Sinquerim beach, Excellent cooks delicious food and Hilary is the Financial Controller"
266,calm n scenic beach of north goa,Locals dropping litter and dogs pooing everywhere not clean at all..such a shame that some people have no respect for their own beautiful country.
267,beautiful beach,The beach does not have much to offer than a few shacks and water sports options . However if you want to avoid the crazy crowds of Baga and Calangute and dont wish to travel all the way to Vagator then this is one beach you can certainly visit . It is surrounded by a few high end properties like Taj Fort Aquada and Holiday Village which have got excellent food if you are looking for expensive / fine dining . However there are plenty of options in terms of the shacks available to eat and drink on a budget . The good part of being on this beach towards evening is that you can certainly move on for you late night party to some of the most happening clubs of Goa which are around this Beach - Cohiba and Soi.
268,"Nice , clean beach","Clean , calm , beautiful .... A must visit for people who love a peace ful sunset ... Spent 4 days in this beach and there are no words to express the joy. ."
269,Quietest of all the beaches!,We visited 10th june17.Very beautiful n it's evening time so pleasant weather.The circle shape wall looks like a fort.Taj vivants hotel is beside.Even steps are there to go to beach.Parking problems is there.For two wheelers no problems.worth to watch.
270,Wouldn't go out of my way to visit,"We went in off season. Less crowd, the way we like it. Clear water, clear beach, friendly travellers, had a great time."
271,Beautiful clean beach,"A quiet and calm place. Not much crowded. However its not neat, you have to be careful as sometimes you will notice glass bottles floating."
272,Just perfect,"This isnt a private beach but its relatively better than the rest, totally worth the time spent driving here"
273,Big coast line,"7.5km of golden sands. Every day a small army of workers move slowly along the tide line clearing the rubbish that washes ashore. Thus the beach is 99% rubbish free and a great place to relax and people watch. Pretty it is not as rows of sun beds and beach bars dominate the back of the beach (there must be several hundred!) and a cocktail or cold beer awaits.Beach vendors are discouraged but despite not being pressured or harassed we bought sarongs, rock crystals and had a massage daily from one of the many men offering the service along the beach front."
274,Beautiful!,"Hello Guys,Please be safe at this beach , there are harmful fishes like stingray fish and jelly fish available in this beach corner sides as well, which may be very dangerous if they bite.Same thing happened with my wife , we were just being standing at the corner side only having water level up to knees , A Stingray fish which is very dangerous have bitten my wife on leg and it was really very painful experience , thanks to god she is safe but that bite may be very harmful to everyone and children's as well , please avoid going to water in this beach and be careful."
275,Beach full of water sports,"lovely beach great for just lazing about, there are a few shacks about so you can get a snack or a drink, it didn't get that crowded when i was there,nearly every day for two weeks."
276,Beautiful beach,"Clean, peaceful beach front...a small bother is the street dogs; however they let you have your good time on the beach! :)"
277,good clean beach,"Totally the cleanest and even then , happening beach on the vicinity of where I used to stay.Located centrally , it was always nice to visit in the morning.Hosts of activities , however bargaining with them is important."
278,Loveliest Beach!,We went to Sinquerim Beach a few days back. We found that it was one of the cleaner beaches in Goa. Thoroughly enjoyed the water sports there. Spent a relaxing day .
279,Nice and clean,Mornings are hectic and noisy with crowds but  after sunset one can sit and relax peacefully. Look at the stars and moon in the sky.
280,Beautiful beach near Aguada fort,"Calm and peacful beach...u will find less people here..so if u enjoy this,this beach is for u..close to calangute...can also visit agauda fort on the other side of road..."
281,Curve beach,Nature comes to its best on the surfing ebb of the waves under the sun on the golden sands and bestows smiles on all young and old collecting fond memories for a life.
282,the perfect beach !,"Enjoyed with my spouse and kid, quite and less crowded. Really nice place to visit. would surely visit again"
283,Beautiful <3,"beautiful moments to spend with friends and family. a quiet beach with no interruptions. minimal visitors, not exactly a public beach. greater privacy and hotel security from Taj Holiday Village and Fort Aguada make this a memorable beach to visit"
284,Amazing Sunsets lovely beach,when we stayed at  the hotel Taj Holiday village during the monsoon season ...it was raining incessantly...the sea was too rough ...the beach is very beautiful...a bit rocky...it was clean nevertheless...
285,Awesome sunrise & sunset view,Sinquerim is just the type of beach that I love... there is no rush... you are not pestered by hawkers every now and then and you can have a really good and undisturbed vacation along with your family... the beaches are really beautiful and clean unlike Calangute and Miramar and the likes... the place has just enough shacks that are required and they too are classy ones... the water is pretty clean and calm and one can have a nice swim.. we also tried water sports there... Would definitely come back for more...
286,Scenic Beach,"In February this was significantly less busier than Candolim beach, with slightly nicer shacks and fewer pushy waiters trying to get you to occupy their sunbeds. I still wouldn't call it quiet or relaxing."
287,Great beach to walk,Average beach that is losing all charm as the sheer volume of beach shacks that have sprung up. Strewn with rubbish daily although the locals do there best to clear the beach in cycles - lots of plastic etc..The beaches further south are far superior.
288,One of the good beach in goa,"Maybe it was the peak season and that’s why it was quite packed. Parking was difficult too for the same reason.There were guides offering various packages for water sports, namely jet skiing, speed boat ride, parasailing etc. We didn’t do anything as they were highly over priced.The beach of course is beautiful, but it do well to be more organised. With authorities taking care of parking, cleanliness and washrooms."
289,Busy beach but still areas of peacefulness,I am totally in love with this particular beach. I wanted to go to this place when I was planning the trip but just happened to visit unknowingly and I ended up spending around 3 hours in the place. The view from the top is also beautiful
290,good beach less crowded,My grandson was doing cart wheels in Caravela and one of his slippers flew out and lodged on the ac vent pelmetNobody realised and spent hours finding it since my grandson was very upset. The staff finally did find it and this will be a story for a long time with my grandson
291,Quiet Beach,"The beach is good otherwise, but is infested with dogs so need to be careful if you are going for a walk or run"
292,Must visit Beach...,So much cleaner than it used to be but the Shack scene is not so lively or good anymore.There are still dogs wondering around doing their dog dooh everywhere so watch your feet!I wish the life guards could be understood.
293,Best Beach - Water sport activities for Sporty people,Cool place best for couples asa lgts h ma o ki sea ke beach me aa gye ho  night me ghumna jyada thik hota h
294,best view of sunset,"Been coming for last 16 years on n off, still a wonderfull beech. Not as littered as it used to be but still room for improvement."
295,Scenic beauty,A morning Jog or even a walk can refresh you with the cool breeze and waves at your feet. A Great Place  to have Evening Leisure romantic walk
296,Good view ,"these are my practical reviews, and u will not dissapointed.sinquerim less crowd peacfull must visit. scenic beachvagatur beach visit this before 9 pm after nine shacks will be closed. must visitand arambol beaches crowded scenic beaches must visit.but do not go for dolphin show in goa, its waste of money and time. they may charge 300rs. or 400 rs,"
297,LOVELY NORTH GOA BEACH,Lots of choices. Liked the fact that there were less people. unlike the baga or the candolim ones. Can take up wate rsports too
298,Beautiful & Scenic,"...but just a shame it wasn’t safe to swim. We knew that there might be issues, but as I am a strong swimmer I had just hoped the reviews might be wrong. The beach itself is lovely and convenient for waking into Candolim avoiding the dirty dusty road."
299,Less crowd in North Goa,"There is a small tuck shop that sells corn, maggie and sandwiches. Chutney mayonaise vada pav is something to try without leaving that place."
