0,Good day out but will be better when fully open,We enjoyed it but could onlySee floors 2 and 4 as others closed due to covid Was a interesting day out Will be back to see the remaining floors when they reopen
1,Great Artifacts. Interesting Stories.,"We managed the first 3 floors but I was scared from the 2nd floor as the lifts are glass and the stairs are open and there are glass bridges to cross from one exhibit to another. The layout is a bit disorganised too.It would be better laid out in time order to see progression. However, what I did see was impressive. The displays and shows were good too. We caught the water taxi from the train station straight to the armouries. That was fun and only ¬£1 each. Lots of places to eat next door if you don't fancy the museum restaurant You could easily spend a day out at this museum if you read all there is to read (&manage to get up to all the floors ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£)"
2,95% fantastic. ,"Great free museum! Many of the interactive parts of the museum weren‚Äôt working which was a shame! Some great, informative displays! Can become a bit tiresome!"
3,Interesting collection of weapons and armor.,we were not expecintg to see this place here but found it whilst walking by the docks and noticing a strange looking building which people kept going into. well worth the visit.
4,Loved it,Lovely historic place to visit. Was well impressed how big the collection was on 5 floors. Entry was free as well but donation boxes near the exit. Lovely cafe on 3rd floor was a nice touch to rest as alot of walking involved. Situation at the side of Leeds lock which is a nice place to walk if you come to Leeds it's a must see.
5,Superb,"As this was a 70th year treat as one of my choices we were quite disappointed, the museum is badly laid out and a bit disjointed. However the displays of suits of armour, one of my interests and the Asiatic galleries were interesting. Some of the displays notably the Elephant Tiger Hunt could do with a good clean and a dust. Also some of the descriptions on the exhibits were not very clear and quite bafly lit, we appreciate that light can damage certain exhibits but not others. All in all we were glad it was free entry. You cannot compare the quality of the Tower of London Armouries to this Leeds is a poor comparison."
6,Blow my mind!!!,Fantastic huge very varied displays and free we only had a few hours here which was not enough time to get round.
7,White Collar Boxing,"We visited this attraction and had a fantastic day out so much to see a real eye opener into arms of the past and the not so distant past.  You even have the opportunity to fire a cross bow for a very reasonable price and it was good fun.  There were different shows put on which the younger visitors seem to love very much,  The actual building stands in a very beautiful position and it was all very clean. I would say there was something for everybody there is a lot to see."
8,Great day out,"Visited Leeds for the day ,this was on our to do list even though it was a sunny day,was so much more than I expected,we were greeted by a pleasant young man who welcomed us and provided a programme  and told us that a performance was due in 10 min s and gave us clear directions to the gallery,and what a performance I was enthralled ,I could have been at the aftermath of the battle of stamford  bridge so vivid was his telling ,and a great prequel to the the usual 1066 and all that ,if this young man was sent in to schools every pupil would love history lessons nothing dry and dusty about this ,dont know if other periods are retold if so I would travel over the pennines again to here of agincourt or charge of the light brigade.This was followed in another gallery by a display of hand to hand combat between a saxon and a viking again really well done and informative .There was also a very good exhibit  of the sepoy rebellion ,and many other interesting things ."
9,Fascinating piece of History let down by the lack of maintenance,"Visited the Royal Armouries as we had been advised that it is a must see attraction. However as we left it until our final day in Leeds , it was impossible to really take in all the ares of interest in 6 hours. Another trip will have to be made in the future"
10,Excellent day out,"Visited with family aged from 75 down to 4, females and males we all thoroughly enjoyed a full day very informative and plenty to see and all the staff were great from Thor and iron man at the entrance right through to the leaflet guy, info staff and the cafe staff all were polite helpful and working their socks off well done to all"
11,Great Museum,"We thought our visit would take a few hours at most but in the end we stayed for five!Static displays are interesting and comprehensive, especially if you like armour, swords, guns etc. However for me the best thing was the half hour talks and re-enactments which were all superb and pitched just at the right level. Very nice and good value cafe on ground and second floors."
12,Perfect for a afternoon.,"Well the answer to that is definitely no!What a fantastic place, we only had three hours which barely scratched the surface, if you are studying the exhibits in detail.You could spend an hour alone at the huge model of the battle of Waterloo! The huge model of Agincourt could swallow another 30 minutes.I suspect it will take another two visits to do it justice.I can‚Äôt wait üòÉüëçüèº"
13,Great collection,"What a gem. We spent at least 4 hours in the Armoury. There are 5 floors of treasures all reachable by lifts or stairs. Wheelchair access is excellent.There are folding seats which hang on the walls of every floor. Just lift one down and take the weright of your feet, then replace it and get another when you need it. The famous mask\helmet belonging to Henry V111 is on display. Reenactments take place about every hour. All this is for free. The staff are very friendly and helpful. When you think you have walked enough, you can enjoy refreshments in one of the cafes. There is also a good gift shop. You can try your skill with a crossbow. 8 bolts for ¬£3.00. Enjoy."
14,Must-See Museum.,4 floors of extremely interesting items even if you‚Äôre not into weapons etc. The elephant and horse armour were great. Most of them were works of art.
15,ONE Day is not enough time to get the full benefit of a visit,4 floors of mainly armour but very interesting and free to get in. Interactive events bring history to life. Great for a rainy day. Wheelchair accessible. Only criticism is could be better signposted to get around each floor as was hard to know where to start.
16,Disappointed ,Our first visit to Leeds but I accompanied my husband to this place as he really wanted to visit I found it interesting for a while but we came across a show at lunchtime about the Spanish Armada and I have to say the young man had his audience mesmerised even the young children sat and listened and we all enjoyed it  I would highly recommend this and all free
17,Good day out,"An excellent surprise, didn't have much time as we were in Leeds for the triathlon, only did one floor, but fascinating! Will return to see more next time, both cafes very nice, very user friendly, a great place. The Leeds Dock area was very good, we took the water taxi back to the station, check out the underground arches and tunnels for the river, all lit up, amazing! River taxi 'captain' was entertaining, friendly and knowledgeable. Really worthwhile trip!"
18,Fabulous and free,Attended a Company meeting hosted on Level 3. Room was suitable for the number of people but inconvenient not having any restrooms on this level. Unfortunately didn‚Äôt get chance to look around but what I could see was interesting.
19,A look around ,"Was taken away by the amount on display on 5 floor, amazing history and very helpful staff. Well worth a visit."
20,Badly organised,We had visited the Museum on a previous vist.   the Museum is very large - exhibits cover four floors so it can become a bit overwhelming.    It is certainly a full day visit or preferably a visit spread over two days.   the exhibits are wonderful and well set out
21,Very interesting ,My sister and niece of 11 years visited from the Wirral. Enjoyed the visit especially the crossbow activity. Lots to see and do with other interactive displays available. There were live shows almost every hour to keep people of all ages to enjoy. Best part is it was all free. Keep up the good work and thank you for the time and effert put into the museum.
22,Always a pleasure!,"An extensive collection with in depth information. Only issue was that it was half term and you could hardly move in some areas. Had to wait ten minutes for a lift due to queues by them and having a pushchair. The short shows required waiting for 30+minutes if you wanted a view, and lasted 5 minutes. The areas they have the shows are hemmed in by display cabinets, which make it impossible for many to view the shows. Only concession is it is free, so I can't complain too much. Will visit again at a term time weekend."
23,"So busy, but extensive collection.","We went here on the 31 oct 2019 it was s fabulous day out we spent 4 hours here just gazing around at the artifacts and amazing Intel that it gives you, there was also reenactments for the children with the ghost busters and other shows which we didnt watch but they were around the museum. A great day out for cold weather plus really friendly staff and a well stocked gift shop which can be a little pricey for certain things, but it all depends what your looking for ... but considering it is free they have to make their money somewhere csnt wait to take the rest of the family"
24,How many guns and swords?,"This is an interesting place to spend the afternoon. The exhibits were well done and my children enjoyed the demo in the theatre. Admission is free, so take advantage of this museum if you find yourself in Leeds."
25,Great attraction,Visited with my family my two children aged 7 really enjoyed looking at all the different weapons from history and so did I really informative and loads to look at.
26,Interesting collections,"Went here on a wet Sunday as came up as a place of interest on trip advisor.Ended up spending 2. 5 hours here as the place is fascinating. Never seen such a large collection of weapons from over 600 years ago. Easy to move around and every floor has a different theme.Had coffee and cake at the cafe which was very nice.Can't believe it's free to get in. Probably a lovely spot in the summer by the river, but not in January.Worth visiting if you're in Leeds for the weekend as we were."
27,Underwhelming,Ideal for kids that enjoy weapons and history. Free to Enter so ideal if your in the area. Shop not too expensive and cafes all over.
28,Wonderful day out!,"A Brilliant Free Museum, with plenty to see for all Age‚Äôs, this place is huge so make sure you have plenty of free time to explore it fully, during school holidays they also have lots of extra things to do from jousting events to talks & shows around the galleries, not only does this place have great exhibits but also the views of Leeds from the many floors are amazing, another Stakes Family top place to visit."
29,Lots of guns ,"We haven‚Äôt been to the Royal Armouries for so long but decided to spend a day us, our son and 3 children and time sure flies when your having fun. 4 hours, but it isn‚Äôt half as long as you need for a good look around this very interesting facility. There are stacks if exhibits with live shows and items to touch and try. There‚Äôs a cafe and a picnic area if you want to bring your own food, drinks machines and snacks too if you have come unprepared. We would recommend this as a great day out and will make sure we visit again but wait too long next time."
30,Great Collection,2nd visit and still enjoyed itInteresting to wander around in my spare time Good food and a wee trinkets shop where you can buy Armoury related tat.
31,Excellent,"Visited here as our children are doing different projects at school in the Greeks and Knights and Castles, we were in leeds on a couples night away anyway so thought while we were there have a look around, really enjoyed it, lots of different exhibits of armour/weapons etc throughout history, lots of interactive  things to do to get children involved , different shows of reenactments  of history to watch, we watched the swordplay which was informative  and funny, would love to go back with my kids in the summer to one of their event days, and it's free,  well worth a visit"
32,Amazing collections,It is a fantastic free museum you could literally spend days in but the curator has not done a good job and things are often illogical with weird bits of knife crime just randomly dotted around. There are various free talks during the day which is a nice addition and various interactive exhibits. A better map is needed.
33,Royal visit,"A great day out for all ages, free entry and lots to see. Only downside was they have taken the WW2 stuff off display which my partner was disappointed about."
34,Leeds armoury,Very helpfully people to give you information the place is huge with some wonderful things to see on all floors with demonstrations going on at different times will be nice to gl in summer and sit beside the locks
35,Super heroes,"I visited with my partner, my daughter age 1 & my nephew 9. Was  surprisingly easy to find in the centre of Leeds and easy to park once we arrived. Car park literally over the road, good lifts and reasonably priced. We got there early afternoon so didn‚Äôt get time to see everything but what we did see was really interesting and informative. Tried the crossbow firing on the top level which everyone enjoyed. Food in the restaurant was good quality with plenty of choice. Coffee is beaut.All in all a great day out."
36,Half term visit,"We had 3 days to show our family around Leeds and this was on their list of things to visit. As residents of Leeds, we'd never been to the museum and were pleasantly surprised by how much there is to see and do! Split over 5 floors, you could spend an entire afternoon here - I found the exhibit on Feudal Japan particularly interesting! Well worth a visit."
37,Fantastic museum ,Very good museum. Its free entry and for the content and artifacts in the museum thats incredible.The staff greeting at the door were fantastic. Dressed in replica period gear and very friendly and welcoming
38,Great day out! ,"It's worth a visit, very interesting with broad exposition. They also organize tournaments! We spend there 3h and it was not enough :)"
39,First class Museum,"Brilliant and free, Donation always given great time caf√©s inside and canal basin outside with a small boat taxi I believe it's free."
40,Good day out,"Many exhibits over 5 floors , plan to spend a few hours in  there , sometimes Special  events  are  on. All floors are  accessible  by the  lifts so wheelchair  friendly.  I really enjoyed  going  round  at my own pace  ,staff  I spoke to  were  friendly and helpful  , bonus  in the afternoon  of live fun firing  in the  marina area, also the  staff  doing the  demonstration  very  knowledgeable about the  weapons they were  using.  The  only negative thing  about the  day was the  restaurant, come on  ¬£2.40 for a  can of  pop ,¬£12.00 for  fish and chips  no wonder  not many people  were in  there !"
41,Amazing place!,The missus is a history buff so this was right up her alley. 5 floors of history with plenty to do for everyone. She had a blast! üòé
42,Fab place! ,"Great museum every weapon you can imagine start on the top floor and work your way down Few cafes in the museum to get a bite to eat, see the knights amour and you can also see Henry VIII‚Äôs armour Also people telling stories or see how knights would fight there‚Äôs also a jousting area next door and shop the kids can always find something to buy Definitely worth a visit if in Leeds"
43,Great place to kill a few hours,"Lovely activity for a rainy day and free! We were greeted by a very friendly front desk man who quickly provided us with a leaflet, told us what was on and outlined what would be busy due to school groups. Great displays, although the Make:Believe section was smaller than I expected. Not that busy on a Friday as it's so larhe you can spread out even when school groups are in. Definitely worth a visit what a lovely selection of armour, information and interactive displays."
44,Network event,Visited this place in July 2019. Lovely modern building with plenty to see. My kids really enjoyed seeing all the history of British armoury. Could easily spend a half day here if not longer.
45,Best museum!,It was really boring and I hated it. Although it was free though so that is a good thing. No idea why it was rated the best thing to do in leeds though
46,Great venue for free,"Lots to see and do with our 11 & 9 year olds. Saw several of the movie themed shows that tied into weaponry. Plus Henry viii suits of armour. We happily spent about 4 hours wandering around interspersed with short live educational activities and shows.Good quality food at the cafe although a little pricey. Lots of toilet facilities, lifts and mobility access. Good for families and war/weapons nerds alike. Amazing that it is free too."
47,Not a lot to see if you are not into war history,Reception/information was desk very helpful. The exhibits were ubelievable. I highly recommend anyone visiting Leeds to visit the museum.
48,Amazing,"visited as they had a special event on stars wars, was Daleks, r2d2, Darth Vader, was nice seeing the childrens faces,as the Daleks came towards them, had a walk round rest of musuem, then popped into cafe for a hot drink, very nice and not to expensive."
49,Amazing,"Heard good things about this place so decided to go and it was free. It was kind of confusing to navigate, the signs weren't very clear but aside from this all the artefacts were amazing to look at and know that Henry VIII wore some of the armour on site. Photos were allowed as long as flash was off which is fine.  While looking around there was announcement over the intercom, whoever was on the intercom was difficult to understand because they spoke so close to the microphone. Shortly after this the fire alarm went off and we were all escorted out the building before we would be locked in as shutters started coming down. This kind of ruined the experience as were then stuck outside in the sun for 30 minutes without any shelter and the fire wardens wouldn't let us sit in the shade. I'm unsure if it was a drill as when we were allowed back inside the fire shutters were still down on the entire first floor which we had to skip as a result.  I found the Asian section was a little weird. It had weapons from almost all Asian countries aside from Korea, which was weird. The fifth floor was a little weird, it didn't really have a purpose. I don't think I would be back."
50,Interesting Medieval Weapons,Really amazing of arms on display- my favourite the suits of armour. Lay out of the building a little confusing but great trip with teenage sons.
51,Amazing place,"Visited today it a while since I have been here and it‚Äôs all changed especially surprised at the parking and prices to park ,but there seemed to be a lot shut off and there was exams on for obviously schools or colleges going so areas was closed, there used to be a great exhibit about World War One and two but that was gone and there was didn‚Äôt seem to be anything to pick up and test or see how they worked rather disappointing there are better museums"
52,So interesting ,I was at a two-day conference in the Armouries and sadly had little time to explore this stunning museum.From what I saw I'd happily recommend it and want to visit again!
53,Love it!,We really enjoyed our trip here and the museum itself was really good and informative. There was something for people of all ages.We decided to eat in the cafe and I'm coeliac and finding something I could eat was a nightmare! They had a really confusing allergens folder and virtually nothing was gluten free.I'll definitely be back to the museum but wouldn't go back to the cafe again.
54,Was worth it!,"I was completely amazed by this place! ‚ù§Ô∏èMy family and I can spend hours here. Seeing all of the weapons and equipment is just fascinating, my son thoroughly enjoyed it. The different events that take place over the course of the day are very interesting. I can‚Äôt wait for our next trip!"
55,Loads to see!,"With 3 boys 10,12 and 14 this was a really good way to spend an afternoon. I would highly recommend it as a day out"
56,Be careful if have allergies ,"Ok, actually my partners choice to visit here. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my visit. Many suits of armour, for horses and even an elephant, not just people. Fantastic to see close up the amount of detail that goes into making these, engraving and etching patterns etc onto the metal, Not just armour, there were canons, swords and lots of guns. Also items about more modern policing and crime investigation. There are also a number of live demonstrations and talks which take place during the day, I watched one on two handed sword fighting, which was interesting."
57,Why have we not been before?,"We hadn‚Äôt initially planned on visiting the Royal Armouries Museum but we wanted to walk to the river and the museum was right there. Approaching it, you see a tall building with windows through which you can see weapons and armour hanging all the way up the walls. There was no admission fee and when you go inside, that display is even more impressive with a mirror that allows you to look up and view the whole display. The rest of the exhibits were interesting as they covered different regions, topics, and time periods. Before we left, we also visited the crossbow range where for 3 pounds, you get 8 arrows. Overall, an educational and enjoyable experience, and a great activity for a rainy day!"
58,take the day for this,"This was a great interesting place with loads of different things to see & do really big place with five floors loads of war weapons and different sections to see, a lot of armour & plenty of places to listen to stories from over time, the museum has many places to sit in the glass front edge to look over the river which was lovely. Great enjoyable day, cafe staff downstairs very friendly & biscuit & cuppa lovely."
59,Good for a family day out,We only spent an hour here because our daughter was rather tired but if you had older kids you could spend a lot longer. She just enjoyed having some space to run around in on a rainy day. There is lots to see and also actors playing characters from the past. The hall of steel is really impressive and not to be missed.
60,Trip to the armouries,"We had a great day out here. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of weapons and armoury but the history is interesting and there‚Äôs lots of interaction for young children. They can shoot a real crossbow for a small charge of ¬£3 for 8 bolts, meet Queen Elizabeth and other characters, and there are various other demonstrations on throughout the day. Entry is free, but there‚Äôs a charge for the horse show, which I would highly recommend. At ¬£5 per adult and ¬£3.50 per child it‚Äôs well worth the money. The show features horses that have been in many popular TV shows.Overall, it‚Äôs an enjoyable family day out."
61,Great family day out,"Four of us went; two really enjoyed it and the other two found it to be one big gun fest. We went specifically for the Movie Night attraction and were all a little disappointed. I suspect this museum is like marmite but the only way you will know whether you love it or not, is to visit."
62,You can loose youself in here for hours,"This was our 2nd. visit. I just wish I didn't live 270 miles away as I would be here every week if I could!!!This time there was a demonstration of Tudor horsemanship going on for a small charge of ¬£5 per person (¬£3.50) for concessions. We finally finished level 3 this time, only 2 more levels to go. Will do them next time in Leeds visiting my mother in law again soon I hope.The museum is fantastic and the staff very helpful and knowledgeable, only to pleased to answer any questions.Just to much to take in a day, you need at least a week to look at everything properly.Main museum is Free but donations are willingly accepted to help with the upkeep.Cafe prices aren't over the top.Would Highly Recommend to young and oldDisabled facilities are very good. Toilets, refuge points and lifts and plenty of staff to help!!"
63,Great place for adults and children,"We visited as a group of three and were pleasantly surprised. It was great, lots to see and do. We spent several hours here and enjoyed every minute of it."
64,Great,Family visit to to Leeds during UK half term. Decided this would be a good option for a wet afternoon. Most amazing collection of weaponry throughout history and across the world. Great for kids too. Recommended.
65,Museum,"Having visited before my wife & I decided to take our 6 year old granddaughter. We parked in Leeds city & took the water taxi from behind the railway station via the dark arches. Our young traveler really enjoyed the short (12minute) trip at ¬£1 each one way which drops right outside the museum. One thing to watch for is the boat capacity is only 12 people which includes toddlers & is strictly enforced so you may not all get on which would lead to about a half hour wait for the boats return.The museum is free we went in & looked around the first two floors which has many interesting exhibits & watched a sword fight demo. Then we went out & tried the Maze which out little one thought was great, followed by a short walk over to Pizza Express for lunch, we then returned to see the other floors before returning via the water taxi, however this time we just missed out due to it being full & had a 30 minute wait as I mentioned. The city can be reached by about a 1/2 hour walk but we decided to wai."
66,Mixed Results,"Amazing and informative displays, the presentation of the weapons and armour is stunning. Only had a couple of hours and literally only scratched the surface. Could happily spend all day in there will definitely be making more time to return and visit again."
67,First visit to Royal Armouries,This is a great place to visit lots to see & activities change regularly.Plenty of eating/picnic tables for those who have brought their own food.There's a lovely cafe too. Shame we didn't visit when our son was little but still worth a trip!
68,Day out,Visited with family including children (10 & 8) and it well exceeded our expectations. The museum is free to visit and car parking nearby will cost less than ¬£10 even if you stay all day. The children loved the displays which worked well for the adults as well and were very professional and informative. We need to go again as 5 hours passed with still tons to see. Thank you.
69,A great day out,Always plenty to do - never enough time! We came again last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed watching the sword fighting display.
70,Great selection of armour through ages with fun and informative displays,"It was  worth a visit even if I only went there because  a few hours to kill.The objects were interesting for me, weapons, armour.On the downside, I cannot say it‚Äôs easy to access. 30minutes from citycentre, no frequently buses. But it was still time well spent and I recommend visiting."
71,Very good ,"Visited several years ago with the kids, had forgotten how huge the building was.  Five floors of arms and armour make for an interesting visit, the shows where aspects of the collection are brought to life are interesting to watch."
72,Free!,"Initially I wasn‚Äôt going to visit as a couple of the exhibits are closed, but my daughter said it was worth a visit as it‚Äôs free. What a brilliant day, there is so much to see I will definitely be back. Yes it was midweek, but it was still very quiet, we were the only 2 for the tour of weapons and armour used in films, very interesting and the guide was personable and very knowledgeable, if he reads this - Thankyou again! We also watched ‚ÄòRoman vs Celt‚Äô with a lot of excited school children, the guys giving the demo were fantastic. We went back for another demonstration, this time on the samurai sword skills and again we were the only 2 watching (so a massive Thankyou for still running the show! Again excellent and insightful and Thankyou for spending extra time at the end to chat. I really cannot recommend enough, go and see the demos and tours it adds so much to the visit and the staff were fantastic.Food in the cafe great too."
73,Ok but needs to be more user friendly,We did not expect it to be so large or have so many exhibits; and other attractions each day. We planned to be there for the morning but it took us over 6 hours to get round and visit ecah display.
74,Awesome Armouries Museum,This is a great place to spend an hour but it‚Äôs good that it is free to go in. The amenities are a tad shabby and there are a few bits falling apart on the displays which is a shame. Tickets for special displays outside are worth it and pretty enjoyable if you are into all things medieval.
75,Tricky for the sensitive,"We have just spent a great 3hrs here ( could have spent longer ) and our grandsons aged 6 & 8 had a super time. The exhibits are first class with clear easy to understand descriptions.  We also enjoyed the live presentation about the start of the battle of Waterloo , the chap doing this was very , very good üëèüëèWe started on the first floor and worked our way up to the 5th where the boys enjoyed their first attempt at firing crossbows. Thoroughly enjoyable for all of us so no hesitation in recommending the Royal Armouries."
76,Good free activity,Very good for a day out with your friends espcially if you have kids to teach them about history..We really enjoyed the swordplay they played as well..And do not forget to donate gerenously if you enjoy it ;)
77,very enjoyable,If you interested in history and especially history based on war then this is the place for you. It's massive! I've recently been to the imperial war museum and was disappointed with the lack of displays. This place even had a demonstration which was awesome! All this and it's free. I can honestly say for me it is the best museum I've been to in years!
78,Royal armoury,We enjoyed a great day out at the Royal Armouries Museum. There were excellent demonstrations and presentations every hour and plenty to see. The crossbow range was a particular highlight. The ground floor cafe is very good and the second floor cafe had good value lunch options. We found it slightly hard to navigate - there are some great exhibits tucked away in the corners of the main galleries and comparing notes at home afterwards it seems we missed some that would have been really interesting which is a shame. It's great that the museum if free - and it's very well worth a visit.
79,Great days out ,"I have to admit when my husband said we were going here i wasnt to keen as i expected a dark dull array of guns ect . Wow what a surprise , The museum is modern light and airy and had a vast array of armour and weapons from all around the world ,we spent ages in there . A really interesting great day out"
80,3 generations visit,Firstly it is free for all. Avenger characters were a nice touch for the kidsLots to see here but not all was open which was a shameLots and lots and lots and lots of guns
81,Grandsons loved it ( we did too ) ,This is a fascinating museum with plenty to see and all very well presented. Spent several hours there quite happily. We will certainly go again
82,Armouries ,"Very impressive collection of historic armours and culture. Specially enjoyed the detailed asian part.  A must if you‚Äôre into history, armours, wars or just curious."
83,Armouries,"This was our 3rd visit, the 2nd this year up in Yorkshire from Kent visiting family.While we were there, we were able to see a couple of the staff practicing for a combat demonstration. After speaking to them about their weapons we were invited into the arena to film their demonstration so they could watch it and see if it needed any changes. Only 2 more levels go and hope to see them next year.Great Disabled Access and very helpful staffA MUST if you have some time to spare in Leeds"
84,Royal Armouries,Excellent educational place for kids and adults to visit. And for free too! We also had a go on the crossbows.
85,Ideal wet weather activity ,Very beautiful place and interesting for my son. He loves the wars! They also have a free water taxi outside and there was a really nice looking restaurant opposite. will have to return to see what else is here.
86,An amazing find.,We ended up at Royal Armoury  by accident and what a lucky accident. My memories of boring rows and rows of pikes etc. The museum is laid out amazingly with so much supporting history to the exhibits. Definitely a place we will visit by choice many more times
87,DAVE'S ,I was surprised how many exhibits were from overseas and it was not just British Armour and weapons. It was interesting to find out about many countries in one building. Everything was well laid out with room to move around easily.Unfortunately some of the displays you could try out were not working or looking a bit shabby but this may be because i visited at end of school holidays
88,Amazing,"My title is self explanatory,however what we did differently was to use the fantastic yellow water taxi from granary wharf right up to the museum.( saved big parking fee)The museum is brilliant and the building itself lovely with great waterfront views.What was a teeny bit disappointing was ,nothing had really changed in the last eight years or so since we came last time.Also no outdoor events on which was a surprise on a Sunday in May.But definitely worth a visit."
89,A log day but plenty to see and do,"Its free to enter,bonus, not many attractions are free these days. At least 3 - 4 hours to fully appreciate this place.  There was a 2 handed sword fighting demonstration also knights in armour sword fighting.  Each floor had different years of armour and weapons. On the top floor, for a small fee you could shoot a cross bow. Some of the exhibitions had empty display cases. But, as it is a charity they have to build up their displays over time.  Down side, it does not have its own car park, but parking is near to hand.  We parked in the brewery car park which was cheaper than the one nearest the Armouries and only a short walk.Wife is now adding her bit:  On the down side for me it had lifts (I don't like lifts) and they were glass, I had a massive panic attack and had to get out.  There are stairs.Also, the places to eat: there is a nice cafe on the ground floor, where we had a coffee on arrival and on floor 2 is a coffee shop, where we had a sandwich and coffee, but, be mindful that after the combat had finished at around 12.15 ish people flocked there, even people with pack up, who were taking up tables and seats from people who were buying from the cafe, even though there is a picnic area on floor 4."
90,Super,We are not really museum lovers but the Royal Armouries is a brilliant experience and not just for weapons buffs . You can try your hand at crossbow shooting as an example of a hands on experience . The setting is great as well on the river . If you can get there on the little yellow water taxis from near the station in Leeds  which makes the day complete .
91,Fantastic and interesting place to visit,An amazing place for those who love history and are passionate about military. A great idea to spend a weekend day with your children.
92,Enjoyable trip but the restaurant wasn't great!,"I have visited before, probably more than 10 years ago. It was good then and It‚Äôs still an amazing place to visit and the exhibits are stunning. If you do visit, please remember to make a donation to enable this fantastic exhibition to continue for all future visitors."
93,Fabulous museum !,Our students had a fantastic time looking around all the guns and armor. Especially like during crossbows and watching the duel handed display. Only wish they could do educational workshops in holiday time.
94,Awesome! Just wish I had more time!,"Excellent museum, well laid out, plenty for children. Could have really done with 2 days at least. A couple of places to eat but central location so eating places outside as well. Xxx"
95,Worth travelling far to visit,Very interesting Museum. Although it is displaying things meant to kill human beings it is interesting to see their evolution. The Museum is Wells organizer and free of charge to visit. Recommended.
96,Well worth a day of anyone's time ...,"Had the day on my own during a recent visit to Leeds, so decided to walk to this museum and boy am I glad I did. Fabulous musem, spread over a number of floors, with a wide range of exhibits. There is so much to see here and it is so well laid out - and it's free. Would strongly recommend this to everyone, it ranks as one of the best museums I have ever visited and I've been to a few over my lifetime. I was there for several hours but need to go back a few more times to really take it all in. It also has a very good cafe with a good choice of food. Thank you for a very uplifting experience."
97,Wow,Not being particularly interested in military history or weapons I was hesitant to visit - but it is so interesting. The exhibits are well displayed and offer insight into global history for those who love weapons and those who don't!
98,Better than expected ,Put it on your bucket list.Fantastic day out with so much to see.It helps of cause to now about war to bring everything together.If your interest are 'Love Island' then don't bother with any museum.'The greatest risk to our heritage is ignorance'.
99,Dads birthday trip,"I had never visited before but was blown away with this place. Would 100% recommend it to anyone for an amazing day out. The armoury has live action performances and a variety of events and different exibits, including artwork. It was full of information and so much to see and interact with. Was very impressed with it as well as the exhibits the armoury has a gift shop and cafe on site."
100,Great day,"Great family day out not to be missed when in the area. The programme of events are interesting, educational and fun. Enjoyably for all the family. Only negative point for me was the ground floor cafe. I enjoy a pot of tea and was looking forward to one, but teapots not available only a mug of hot water with a tea bag thrown in. Certainly not my satisfaction, but I do appreciate this is norm in a lot of establishments. What I do find difficult to understand his how they can charge ¬£1.90 for a mug of hot water, a tea bag and a drop of milk !"
101,Something for all the family,We were very impressed with the exhibition we would visit again and recommend it to others .we couldn't believe it was free to visit totally unexpected .the tall stairs with the different weapons was stunning and the Asian display was my favourite
102,Wow,Great day out. Myself and my dear dad enjoyed our visit so much. Lots of history on view. Especially appreciated the way displays. Cheers for a great day.
103,Over rated,"An amazing Museum with collections is Arms and equipment from throughout history, a great day out very informative and plenty of interactive talks throughout the museum."
104,Took a friend from Spain,"An amazing day from start to finish. Particular praise must go to Keith and Andrew: their live demonstration of two-handed swords both thrilled and educated us; we then went on the weep at Andrew‚Äôs dramatisation of the D-Day landings, which had even the 7 year old riveted. We also loved the crossbow range, and the man staffing this was hugely helpful and engaging. We spent all day here, and still had more to see. Highly recommended."
105,Excellent museum and it's free,Not my first visit and probably not my last. This museum is free to enter and charity funded which is how museums should be to encourage people to learn about the past.This is a must for anyone visiting Leeds and only a short river taxi ride (¬£1) from Granary Wharf  or a 20 minute stroll from the city centre.
106,Little gem of leeds,Visited in the summer with my elderly mother and sister. We done the water taxi from the city centre to the museum for ¬£1 per person. The Armouries are a very interesting place to visit and ideally you could spend the whole day in there wandering around the numerous exhibitions. There are various live demonstrations throughout the day and we would certainly visit again. Overall a cheap day out for the whole family.
107,A full day experience,Child friendly.  Cafe.  Gift shop.  Loads of galleries.  Military lovers heaven. Lifts to all floors. Outside areas and near canal for walking or boat trip. A jewel to visit.
108,Visit with my granddaughter,Went there about a month again in a Saturday. I had heard about but never been. I was amazed at how big it is. We worked our way through each section in order. But the time we got got the middle it all started to look the same. Up until the floor with the elephant which I enjoyed. Do take the golden elevator if you can find it to the top floor. Overall a great 2.5 hours of history.
109,Nice experience..,A ‚Äúmust do‚Äù if in Leeds with the kids or in you‚Äôre own. Brilliant value I.e. free! First class collection presented in an engaging and thought provoking way. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough
110,I really wanted to like it,A brilliant museum. One of the best I have been too. And the large above-head display of armoury is stunning.
111,The most guns I‚Äôve ever seen,Worth to see the Royal Armouries Museum.Beautiful exhibits of interestingly shown scenes Everyone should visit this place no matter what the age.
112,Really good day out,"A fantastic place full of history, awesome demonstrations and staff that know there stuff and always ready to engage with you. Gift shop and cafe worth a visit as well"
113,Leeds,"A visit to Leeds is not complete without a visit to the Royal Armories it has something for everyone, adults love it and kids love it"
114,"Great Free Museum, worth a visit","The museum has lots of interesting exhibits but also some bits which can get a bit boring, so I advise being selective about what you want to see to avoid getting tired. Also, if you can go and see the performances, these are super interesting!"
115,Interesting day,I was surprised by the volume of items on display and exhibits. The museum is free and also holds informative talks/demonstrations throughout the day. The young man at the help desk was such a gem- so enthusiastic and helpful. Would definitely recommend a visit when in Leeds.
116,Great day for all ages,"Massive conference hall, for the Award ceremony we went to. Again everything was modern and clean, and staff were very helpful."
117,Family visit from Wirral,"We visited here this past weekend and it's a great attraction for families, loads of things to see and do and they run a number of events during the day, be sure to pick up a timetable when you arrive."
118,A great museum for hours of free entertainment,Some new exhibitions since we last there but still a lot the same but talks always good and informative.Facilities not so good! Cafe on second floor closed and drinks machine on 4th floor out of order so could only get a drink in ground floor cafe which is not good when you are looking at exhibits.Toilets were untidy too could do with referb
119,Really boring,Iconic experience in Leeds - a must visit for kids and make sure to ask reception about when the time events are on throughout the day. Some cool demonstrations of fencing and all sorts.
120,Good school holiday activities ,"We struggled to find it and were not sure what to expect but were amazed by what you get for free. Don't judge it by the front or the reception where staff just sit about looking at each other. The shows and performances are incredible. Its like being in a film and seeing a live action film in person. There were lots of teenagers on a school trip but they were well behaved and the place is so huge that you don't even notice them. Plus its good to see them in a museum and learning. There were members of staff getting artefacts out for them and keeping them entertained, which is great to. Highly recommended!"
121,Great place ,Very interesting and something for everyone. Great cafes and plenty of parking nearby. Plus it's free entry! Looking forward to going back.
122,Quick visit with 11 year old and 19 year old,This is such a good museum. There is loads to do and if your just in the city center you can get a ¬£1 boat ride to the museum.
123,Worth a visit,"Found this Museum, whilst out and about over in Yorkshire5 floors showing much history about guns Armoury and other stuff, we spent two hours in the museum, on all the five floors, think we got lost once or twice as so much to look at, and many Different walk waysCar park only 5 minutes away and located fantastic on the docksWell recommended if you like history all about wars, guns, EctSo much to look at, and a fantastic day outMany different stories and actors you can watch, you could spend hours in here looking at stuffWe will definitely go back and take Kids next time"
124,Great activity in Leeds! Free and suitable for everyone!,The frequent ‚Äúshows‚Äù were brilliant and covers a wide range of topics from ghostly goings on (Halloween) to the science and stories of armour.We could spend another day there but the kids could probably do with a break.....Really fun and informative day. Highly recommended
125,Great history be visited. Something for everybody,"You can easy spend half a day in the museum.  Knights amour,  large collection of arms , few cafes etc..."
126,A Must see!,Thoroughly enjoyed it a real eye opener and the exhibits are amazing and the staff were very helpful
127,Such a WOW experience!,Had a fantastic couple of days visiting the museum. Easy to get to from the train station. Cafe on the ground floor serves lovely food at avreasonable price. Plenty of exhibits and things to do. The shop stocks a variety of gifts books and toys for all ages. Well worth a visit.
128,great exhibition,"A very disappointing visit to a museum we have wanted to go to for a long time.  When you exit the very expensive car park there is no signage (theme of the day) for The Armouries. So we toddle the long way round, mentioned this to the meeter & greeter who found it amusing. Handed a flimsy leaflet for displays that would be taking place. We didn‚Äôt buy the ¬£5 Souvenir Guide Book as it was more Souvenir than Guide. The signage is appalling in the museum and there are no Museum Assistants visible in the exhibit ‚Äúrooms‚Äù to interact with. There is no flow to the exhibits, you need night vision binoculars to read some of the descriptors, all descriptors are in English only, no audio guides available and no story attached to many of the exhibits. It felt like a hoarders overflow warehouse. This museum has so much potential but is poorly curated. The shop underlined this as in a display ‚ÄòMyths & Legends‚Äô the goods on offer were Star Wars and Game of Thrones merchandise!The cafe is overpriced and the toilets were average. They are checked hourly and the one I visited had been checked 2 hours in advance of my visit!We would much rather pay for a Museum visit and have it curated in a more inviting and inclusive way. And have it staffed by people interested in the collection."
129,Tourist ,Really enjoyed visiting this museum and such a wide range of exhibits. Can spend a good few hours here without getting bored. Highly recommended. I really enjoyed the section Oriental on level 4 with the elephant in armour including exhibits from the Mughal India era. Has a cafe on ground floor along with a well stocked souvenir store. In the city dock area. There is a multi storey car park next to the museum and also some free short term street parking less than 5 minute walk away if lucky to get a space.
130,Great place with lots of security personnel.,Visited the Royal Armouries and spent three hours here - could have been a lot longer! Fascinating collection of arms and armour split into different time periods and locations. Highly recommended.
131,For Business Use,So much to see. Unexpected visit.  We really enjoyed the Star Wars section and the shows. Would recommend to families and couples
132,Fascinating and educational,"Good day out worth a visit ,easy access parking not to bad but expensive 6.50 for 3 hours but apart from that a interesting time was had"
133,Good way to pass a day,"Great history be visited. Something for everybody, Close to city centre, so no excuses, This place just keeps evolving and getting better."
134,a day out,"It was good , really cool , would recommend and I think that‚Äôs it‚Äôs interesting but don‚Äôt know if young children will enjoy ."
135,Free entrance and interesting museum,We called at  the Museum for a quick visit and were taken aback by the wonderful and extensive dis[playes.  There are five floors and frankly you could easily spend a day on each floor there is so mch to see - this is what I plan to do!  I can honestly say it is one of the best museums I have visited on my trip around the world.  It caters for families and children  and is easily accesible .  The shop is well worth a visit and it has all sortds on offer and a wide range of books.  There are also cafes and rest areas.  The bonus is that it is all free..  However the ouside restaurants are far from cheap..
136,Perfect time killer,"Lovely day out and suitable for all ages. Met by a very lovely enthusiastic gentleman who gave us loads of advice as first time visitors. Lots to see, managed to catch part of one of the demonstrations which was very interesting. Well worth a visit."
137,Very interesting museum and free entrance,"Fantastic museum- huge variety of exhibits and shows- all for free! Would recommend to anyone, could easily spend all day here if you go round the whole place and watch all the shows. Had a great day out here!"
138,Superb place ,"As we live not too far, we've often visited this museum this year. There is always something happening there (shows, demos, talks ...) and it has been very interesting for us and our 3 years old daughter. And the entrance is free!"
139,Michael Walker,"Beautifully displayed weapons from stone age through to First WW.  Fascinating stories, films and displays.  Sadly did not time it right for any of the many activity days (including sword fighting, jousting etc) they put on but I'll make sure we do next time."
140,Interesting visit,We were looking for a place with air conditioning to escape the heat but found a gem that sucked hours from us. Amazing! Britain has an amazing bit of history tucked away in this museum.
141,Amazing,"An interesting visit, especially for the medieval artefacts but I was disappointed that it ceased at WW1. Very little on WW2 and beyond. Excellent ‚Äòbring to life‚Äô presentations."
142,Disappointed ,What a treat this place is! My fianc√© and I visited and were so surprised to see it was free entry as the collection inside is amazing! We watched some really interesting demonstrations and the gents involved were very knowledgeable. We also received a little talk from a guy working on reception who saw us walking around and shared his knowledge of elephants in battle which he was very passionate about. Suitable for all ages and the crossbow range was an added bit of fun
143,Free to enter ,"We were staying across the canal from the Royal Armoury with its distinctive tower. A fascinating free museum which is really a history of war. Beautifully displayed items with lots of information. Also enjoyed the live performances highlighting aspects of history. We visited the Armoury over two days and were lucky enough to see a live re enactment from the era of Charles II with costuming , jousting and horses. The circular tower full of all types of arms is quite magnificent."
144,Excellent visit and a highlight in leeds,This place has a lot to tell you about the history of the British Army but I was quite surprised to see oriental pieces on display such as the repeating crossbow! Really did like the chair made out of weapons to show the importance of peace.
145,It just gets better each time. 3rd Visit,"Amazing. Had wonderful displays and actors, great cafes and gift shop. It is free to get in, and has 5 floors with different armouries from many eras. Would definitely recommend for people interested in the context of what the museum has to offer."
146,A very interesting visit.,I liked the bit with the armour. Lovely surrounds and an ideal place to have a cup of tea with a biscuit.
147,Ok,I absolutely loved it at the armouries. This is a fantastic day out and suitable for all ages. The tower of weapons is amazing and I would definitely recommend a visit with a trip into Leeds afterwards as this is a lovely city for shopping and going out - it has a friendly vibe and good feel about it ...I will be coming back!
148,Review,"I travelled from Portsmouth (also home of the Royal Armouries) especially to visit this museum and I was not disappointed. Being the start of the school term, the museum was fairly empty, so I was able to enjoy roaming around at my own pace. On arrival I was welcomed and given a timetable of events happening every 45 minutes. The costume interpreters were brilliant. Entertaining, informative at times poignant. I have a special interest in medieval armour and the armour of Henry VIII but found every floor was worth a visit. I especially enjoyed the Oriental Gallery.I had a welcome break in the cafe. The staff member serving polite and welcoming. The shop a typical musuem shop. Staff helpful.I would assume an average visit is 2-3 hours, but I was happy to stay all day.I found the museum well sign-posted from the city centre, where I was staying. It took me about 20 minutes to walk there.   Really pleased I visited and the museum far exceeded my expectations. well worth the trip from Portsmouth."
149,Mike Thomas ,really good jousting and sword fighting . though children do get bored after being there for over two hours
150,"Mr,Mrs Minter","We'd been looking forward to visiting the armouries for a while, however we both went out separate ways inside to follow our noses. Our conclusion was it was quite a disorganised place that didn't really seem to flow properly. Sorry Armouries."
151,Many exhibitions  ,"I had always meant to visit The Royal Armouries Leeds but never got around to it. Somehow the expectations I had always carried in my head were realized.The Armouries are to me what it says on the can, swords, muskets & guns from around the world.......lots of them ! Found myself walking past showcase after showcase not bothering to look because after a time it became very much a sameness. The building and presentation are excellent, but my I rather fear the place was really a kind of overspill warehouse for artefacts they don't have room for in London. Won't be rushing back!"
152,Good,The Royal Armouries Museum is free  and a very interesting place to visit  the Museum is fantastic so much to look at . Yes you must visit Visitors and Travellers  do it .
153,Not a good showing for the armouries,"good well-spaced building with arms and armour with good historical information. really good are the demonstrations, get close and interactive. crossbow rage really fun, though they need zeroing"
154,"Free, interesting, but a little repetitive","Me and my 9 year old son visited this museum this morning. We arrived 10 minutes before the opening hour. I was surprised to see many families with young children were already there. Soon the place was packed. You can tell how popular this place is especially when there are tourists too. Can‚Äôt believe there are so many things to see. It was an educational visit for us too as we had learned a lot about different types of swords, guns , amour etc...Amazing place to visit. Highly recommended!"
155,Great afternoon with Family..,Excellent museum for the whole family. Lots of great interesting exhibits arranged logically. Some quirky innovative experiences. Really liked it and should have given it more time as it looked as if the restaurant was great.
156,Overwhelming museum,"This museum is first rate and absolutely free. In no way did we see everything so it warrants a return visit. The exhibits are displayed well with good explanations. It is such a huge complex it is hard to explore in a methodical way. Throughout the day, during the school holidays, there are live demonstrations which are well worthwhile, bringing history to life. At the end of the building is a full height tower full of armaments displayed artistically. About 3000 pieces, I believe."
157,"Excellent museum with numerous interactive events in a lovely, canal-side location in central Leeds","Fantastic place to visit, great value for money. Educational and some very interesting talks. Parking reasonable in the Leeds Docks multi-storey. Lots of school trips on my trip with some teachers not doing very good at supervision."
158,Best museum in Leeds,"What a great way to spend a day, took our grandson as he is army mad. I didn't realise how large the museum was. There are a number of daily events which take place, these range from combat demonstrations & gun firing to talks on different subjects with the en-actors in period costume. There is also the opportunity for visitors to handle some of the swords etc. There are cafe facilities along with a ""picnic area"" where you can bring your own food and drink.Admission is free but donations are gratefully received. In all a cheap day out with an educational experience & would definitely go again as exhibits do change and I am sure we did not see everything."
159,"Great artefacts & shows/demos, confusing layout & not for those scared of heights.",me and my massive family had a hoot at this place - the soldiers and armoury and my boy Yusuf loved it so much. so many memories are created and we had ONLY come to eat at restaurant next door. asad from the restaurant recommended we come over here and it was not a disappointment. shocked we never knew ot was there but OMG amainzg times.
160,Just a quick visit but very interesting.,Lovely clean cafe in the the armories ..staff super friendly...and probably the cleanest toilets ive ever seen ..super
161,Arrived at opening time. Left just before closing. An excellent day.,"If you want a free day out with the kids then this can be great. It is big with lots to look at. If you like suits of armour and guns hidden behind glass cases then go for it!  There are plenty of activities that entertain kids (and even me with my short attention span) like eagle flying, jousting and story time.  The archery on the top floor is FUN! Most people tend to enjoy it, I just find this sort of activity duller than really dull dish water. I have been with kids a few times, and my God it is boring!! The main thing that would change my opinion would be a fabulous coffee shop... give me caffeine... but it only has a rubbishy one... so I am out.! üòÉ"
162,Amazing !!!!!!,Worth while to see once but that‚Äôs it. There is a nice cafe and the staff are friendly.There‚Äôs a archery facility for practice on the top floor
163,Many Things to look at,My water taxi took me from my hotel to Leeds Dock where this museum is right by the dock. Absolutely fascinating over 4 floors and you need to put aside about a couple of hours to do it justice. Its free admission and I urge you to visit. You will be pleasantly surprised. Has a couple of coffee shops
164,fantastic!,"Close to city centre, so walkable if it‚Äôs dry. Multi story car park next door. 5 floors of interesting displays, live fights and great mock ups of how the armour was worn and used. Full journey through history, well worth a visit."
165,visit it for sure,"Trying to stay cool, we decided to visit, absolutely excellent, so interesting, again I learned a great deal, friendly and informative staff, great time."
166,Thoroughly enjoyed my visit,"The museum is amazing, BUT... the restaurant on the ground floor has a worrying, and potentially dangerous, error on the laminated menu we saw. Naturally this may change before you visit. My daughter has allergies to dairy and egg, so we are always very careful when eating out. The menu has several dishes labelled Vg for vegan. They did not really appeal to my daughter so we asked for the allergy book to check other dishes for dairy and egg content. It was at this point we decided to go with a vegan flatbread dish. However, the allergy book said it had milk in it. I asked the server and she said the allergy book must have an error. At the counter the server called '1 veggie flatbread' through to the kitchen. I am guessing this was from habit. I asked her to check again. I am so glad I did as the meal does contain milk.The server was great, we were re-embersed for the meal and they made up the other dish. But, they really should either withdraw the menu or have signs explaining the error. If my daughter had eaten the food she might have needed medical help urgently. So, great museum but check the menu carefully"
167,Don't bother,I wasn't sure what to expect but really enjoyed our visit here. Lots of history and great interpretation. Particularly enjoyed the live Samurai demonstration. Easy to get round and nice coffee shop too
168,Worth a visit for sure! ,"I've been to the armouries several times but it's still just as interesting. A very impressive Henry VIII collection. Takes a long time to look around, so many rooms and so much to see. Definitely worth a visit especially with free admission. Good day out for kids and the crossbow range is good fun too for a few extra pound."
169,"Amazing museum,great displays and fantastic demonstrations","... in fact, several days to do it proper justice. Not just stuff behind glass but also a daily programme of live events, interpretations, tale telling and hands on sessions by helpful and enthusiastic staff. The tournament and jousting days are great fun too."
170,Fantastic Place to Visit,I have visited this place a few times now. What a fresh breath of air! It's free entry and you can make a really good day out with the royal armouries. Friendly staff
171,Fantastic!!,A well laid out museum with plenty to see for young and old. Well worth a visit. The cafe s are reasonably priced with some good food.
172,The master's,Fantastic morning free entertainment full of  interesting artefacts demonstrations and interactive displays. Must seen to anyone passing by
173,Not to be missed!,"My son and I spent a whole day here. A huge amount to see, including the excellent presentations by Armouries staff."
174,History,"This mueseum is great value, and not just because it is free.  They run interesting demonstrations with very entertaining staff (performers).  There is a lot of history and many, many exhibits.  If you're not a history buff, it's maybe a 1-2 hour visit."
175,Day out,"There were 4 floors of exhibitions showing weapons used for different purpose, hunting, self defense, war, etc. It is also informative showing how the weapons have changed over times. About 10 to 15 minutes from the bus terminal."
176,Brilliant museum!,We absolutely loved visiting the Royal Armouries museum and the walk along the canal to get there is gorgeous too! We spent about 4 hours in the museum and loved every minute.
177,interesting museum but very dirty,"For anyone that likes history, the art of war and very well put together displays - this is your place! While spending a few days in Leeds, I took the time to see what their version of the Royal Armouries Museum had to offer and I was blown away with amazement. It is easy to spend a few hours in here reading about the different periods of war times, watching live action displays that are out on daily, having a snack/coffee in the cafe and best of all, the cross bow range that allows you to shoot real cross bows at targets for a low cost! Highly recommend for locals, travels and the curious!"
178,Absolutely amazing,Quick visit on a rainy day. Spent an hour and a half. Especially liked the oriental section as son is a Japan enthusiast. Current exhibition of movie weapons a bit smaller than anticipated but still worth a look. Good shop.
179,Great History,Food in cafe is very nice and reasonably priced however service is slow and staff members slightly rude.
180,Thoroughly enjoyable,This is definately a place to visit if you are interested in armoury and/or warfare. I am not but I still found it very good and well worth the time spent there.
181,Family visit ,Took my siblings for a day and it was a very nice experience. Happen to walk in a reenactment which captured their attentions. My little brother has ants in his pants but he was really happy asking questions and actually wants to go back. And as a free option for a day out in bad weather kids dont have to be stuck at home would recommend.
182,Pretty cool place,We haven't been for a few years but really enjoyed ourselves once again. Wall to Wall weapons from every continent displayed over 5 floors. We also managed to catch a short history lecture (Waterloo) and a demo on broadswords. Both were excellent. Cafes on a at least two floors which served tasty competitively priced snacks. Gift shop was good too. All in all we really enjoyed our 3+ hours at this museum.  Very happy to recommend
183,One of our great museums - free,"Fantastic FREE museum so much to see and do. Great shows going on all around the venue. Buy the guide book for a fiver. It's really good value, absolutely love the place the tower staircase is worth the visit alone. Armour and weapons from all around the world. Wonderfully, great staff as well."
184,Truly fantastic,"Can't fault this place - for starters it's free, then it has a great collection of unique exhibits and also some great displays / reenactments of history.  So even in our visit we were able to hear a Napoleonic war story and also see some medieval fighting with weapons of the time, humourously narrated by the people who work there.  Only a 10-15 min walk from the city centre.  Highly recommend this."
185,Brilliant place,"So my son and I, having exhausted the activities in York, decided to take a 2 day trip to Leeds to visit the Armouries and it has to be one of the most interesting and well set out museums in the country. We got in when the museum opened (approx. 10am I think) and didn't emerge until about 3. We started at the top and slowly worked our way down, finishing like so many others in the gift shop.The displays are interesting and well set out, with displays stretching from relatively ancient to modern day examples of weaponry all displayed in a way that's accessible with easily understandable information alongside. We went to 2 recreations through the day, one with the 2 guys fighting in plate armour and the Cavalier recounting the tale of a particular battle from the civil war. The stand outs for my son were the recreations and the Crossbow range on the top floor (he couldn't hit the broadside of a barn and is getting a club when the zombie apocalypse hits). This is an excellent free day out (a donation is recommended, we did) and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."
186,Two day visit to Leeds,"As a student of military history and with a personal involvement in the military heritage sector, I was looking forward to my visit with a view to seeing how the historical interpretation is handled. Whilst there is a staggering amount to see, I felt the museum lets itself down in setting the human context adequately. And while the guide book is excellent with a good self-guiding map, it was difficult to translate this to orientating oneself in the galleries. And it was very easy to start at the wrong end of an historical journey. I was disappointed that the 1844 model of the Battle of Waterloo failed to explain the sequence of actions which I felt could be achieved using sequenced lighting and audio. Also disappointed that post World War 1 was not covered in the War section. I had had some glowing recommendations from friends who had visited it before, but overall I was overwhelmed by artefacts and underwhelmed by the interpretation."
187,Fantastic ,First visit. Really enjoyed the experience. Medieval horse show. Great bit of fun. Also hand to hand lance fighting. The kids all around laughed and laughed. Very well laid out with different levels. Old weapons and armour right up the the present day. You could spend hours and not see everything.
188,Great day ,"We went here as part of our honeymoon as my husband is ex military and has always wanted to visit here. We spent around 3 hours there and whilst there was plenty to see, some areas were shut or pieces missing but that‚Äôs to be expected in such a huge place. We saw a live demonstration of the samurai sword from a lovely gent named Keith. He was really good and it was an enjoyable watch. We also went and did the crossbow experience which was only ¬£3 and was great fun! The only negative was that after and hour or so I felt it was a bit repetitive."
189,Brilliant museum ,"A lovely day spent at this splendid museum, it is well set out and very educational ,all the exhibits are well described, ,staff were all pleasant and helpful, a small cafe and also an area where you can eat your own picnic, my granddaughter enjoyed and learned a lot , it is free to enter, I would advise buying a guide book for ¬£5, a good day out, the only downside was the overpriced car park adjacent to the museum"
190,Great day out,"Been so many times, and it never fails to impress. I especially love the top two floors. Some really interesting little gems up there. You can make this a trip for kids of any age, if you use your imagination a little."
191,Awesome,- Free entry - Wide variety of interactive stations - plenty of different shows - variety of different historical piece
192,Great Museum ,"For years i have been looking forward to a visit to the armories' museum, something always got in the way.  Well finally managed  it  first impressions were very good , but as i progressed, i started to see more of the interactive experience's were not working or broken,  cabinets that had  information labels in were either missing or were turned over so  you were unable to see the information typed on , The final part  of the exhibition top floor with the modern warfare i thought was very cluttered as if the items had been dumped in. The more I progressed i took a longer view of my surroundings and came to the conclusion. that the museum was looking tired and jaded  through lack of maintenance . I felt sorry for the children who the interactive part is important part of the experience. I would visit it again though if nothing more to see it had been improved  upon."
193,Something for everyone,"I haven‚Äôt been to the museum and was surprised by the amount of new buildings that have gone up since I was last there.  Parked in the multi-storey car park just a short walk from the armouriesOn the day we went there was also a practice for an up and coming tournament and for ¬£5‚Äôs you could watch it.  We close to all the action and it was worth the money even it was cold sitting outsideThe museum itself is free to visit and covers 4 floors, there is so much to see and do, besides exhibits there are live demonstrations which adds to the history There are a couple of places to eat and the usual gift shop to buy somethingIf it is warm you can sit on the canal side and there several places to eat outsideAn interesting place to visit and probably worth more than one visit, I would recommend a trip"
194,Outstanding,"Appeals to children and adults alike.  Particularly liked the flexibility of being able to wander around and spend more time in the areas of your choice. The collections are varied and spectacular, although the icing on the cake are the various shows timetabled throughout the day, these brought history to life!"
195,It‚Äôs Free,"This was our first stop on our Day Trip from London to Leeds yesterday.We walked there from the station after failing to find the boarding point for the water taxi from the station to the Armouries museum.The museum spans five floors.On the top floor you have a crossbow range,which was good fun to try just ¬£3 for 8 bolts.The Oriental section in the museum was especially impressive,a hunting section also caught the eye.So much impressive weaponry and armour on display from different eras of world history.üëçüèªThe jewel in the crown though are their fantastic demonstrations we were treated to a fun and informative performance demonstration of usage of the two handed sword.Was a privilege to watch.I would have liked to have seen the other demonstrations that were on during the day,but unfortunately,we had limited time and had other things to cover on our Day Trip to Leeds.There is enough in this museum to keep you engaged for the majority of a day if you have the time available. 5 stars for this brilliant museum,that is also free entry."
196,Really great museum!,Had a really great time time here today lots of things to see and do. With my wife being in a wheelchair I didn't know what to expect but everything is accessible and we'll planned enabling her to see everything easily.Only downside was the cafe on the ground floor is very expensive (¬£6.50 for a sausage roll!) Other than that a first class day out
197,The Best Museum,"What an amazing place and Leeds Dock is bustling with restaurants and people doing exercise and yoga, drinking coffee and having lunch. Really easy to travel to and park (pre-booked with CitiPark). 30 second walk to the Museum. There‚Äôs 5 floors of great displays, lots of interactive exhibits and videos for the kids (2yr and 6yr)What made this better was the range of shows and demos that were entertaining and helped to break up the day. They were informative and the kids enjoyed watching and then holding the weapons after. Who knew pulling back a bow took so much strength. Me and my wife also had a blast shooting crossbow bolts. This is an additional cost but fun and cheap 8 bolts for ¬£3. Compared to other archery things like at Warwick castle, this was so much better and our only cost of the day. We took a picnic and would recommend this due to the space outside to eat and being able to go straight back into the museum after. However, there are places to eat just outside as well. Both children enjoyed as much as we did and nice way to show them history and let them ask the questions. There‚Äôs so much to see inside. The museum was flawless for cleanliness, had a cafe on one of the floors and a restaurant downstairs. Always good to finish with a shop and this has to be one of the best historical shops ever for adults and kids."
198,Fantastic day out,"A fantastic display of history, but also so much more than that. I have been many times, whether with friends, partner or my family (with young children) everyone thoroughly enjoys it and wants to return, it truly is fun for all the family. The displays showcase immense pieces of history from all over the world, and the shows put on are thrilling to watch. To top it all off, its free to enter, so there's no reason to not go in and see for yourself. If you want to try, the crossbow shooting is great activity to try, and only about ¬£3 (if I remember correctly). I have been many times, and I'm sure I will be back many more, each time I go I find another part to become fascinated by, so it never seems repeated."
199,Amazing museum,"Our family loved this museum and it exceeded our expectations. It kept a 10 year old and a 7 year old interested for about three hours. The presentation of the collections was brilliant and the reflective tower was unique. We very much enjoyed the uncrowded space and the three shows that actors and performers put on to entertain visitors during the day. It is well located at the quay near large restaurants in an attractive area, it was just difficult to find the enormous building due to a lack of signage on it. The water taxi back to town afterwards was a fab end to our visit."
200,Wall to wall armour,I have been to Royal Armouries many time. Every time I visited I always found something new in it.There are always some event happening in Royal Armouries. This is the best museum I have ever seen in UK. Staff is also very helpful.Only downside is parking is only 2 hours free nearby roadside and its always full.
201,Amazing Visit,From history to modern day the Armouries has it all. You can spend all day looking around the marvellous themed exhibits. Really good shop and plenty of refreshments opportunities. Kids will love it.
202,Interesting & Entertaining,I only had time for an hour to take a quick look around. The place is packed with arms and armour from anywhere swords and spears have ever been used. And from all ages. I shall definitely try to return. My only minor critcism is that some of the display information panels were barely readable in very low lighting.
203,Amazing,"Impressive all round - some visitors from France and they were blown away and it‚Äôs free!  Take the water taxi too!  Well done, Leeds!"
204,Excellent museum.,Very large collection of arms and armour. Plenty to see for anyone who's interested in militaria of all varieties.
205,Outstanding,"Free to enter but you can donate if you wish. Covers all small arms from air pistols to machine guns and all sorts of blades weapons and armour. We only had 2 hours and all I got was an appreciation of what was on display, they do have daily talks on people and their weapons. I saw one on an American archer named Maurice Thompson, very interesting. To see it all would take at least a whole day. There are 4 lifts  lots of toilets and seating a cafe and coffee bar, lots of related dioramas and helpful stewards. There is a crossbow range (8 bolts for ¬£3) an arena in the grounds which also has events. An awful lot to take in in one visit. Overall excellent."
206,Great visit ,"I visited the Armouries on a visit to Leeds (whilst my wife went shopping!!). I thought everything was laid out really well, though the labels could have been a bit bigger, though maybe that's an age thing. The two live shows were good too, The Battle of Stamford Bridge, and the Saxon vs Viking fighting demonstration. I've seen excellent museums in Paris and Florence showing armour, etc., and this was every bit as good."
207,Great rainy day activity,Wow!!! The British really know how to do museums! My favorite part was the demonstrations and re-enactments. Throughout the day there were actors putting the history to life in period costumes and stories! This was so much fun and it really brought the history to life! The displays were well done. The swords from Middle Earth were also very special. I want to come back to see falconry and jousting!!! Also there is a cool water taxi that goes between the train station and the museum for 1 pound per person. It was cool to see Leeds from the river too!
208,An impressive collection,"We only had a spare hour so thought we‚Äôd try and squeeze a quick look around....this was definitely a whistle stop tour but even so it was a really good visit, very interesting, although we did get a bit confused with the layout."
209,Hours of interest!,"Royal Armouries is a great place to take the family. With interesting history, great views, and much more, there really is something for everyone."
210,Impressive collection,One of the jewels of the north and well with a visit. We didn‚Äôt give ourselves enough time but that‚Äôs OK we can come again. Simply a super collection in jaw dropping style at this purpose built venue.
211,Superior Museum.,Never been before even though it‚Äôs been there years lol. Didn‚Äôt know it was so massive!! Great place for a full afternoon when it‚Äôs rainy and miserable out. It‚Äôs hard to make such a subject sanitary enough for sensitive adults and children and they almost pull it off except perhaps for the hunting section ... sad to be associated with Humans when you see some of the stuff there ... but certainly very educational and well worth a visit
212,Can‚Äôt believe this is free,My son was boxing with the White Collar Boxing set up to raise money for Cancer Research. The event was very well run and well supported and loads of money raised. Fantastic support for this charity on the evening which delighted all concerned.
213,Great day out,"It is a must if you are in Leeds to have a look around this place. You can spend hours on each floor looking at the historic items that are on show. Unfortunately we went when it was a school holiday, so there were a lot of children there which slowed things down a bit."
214,Royal Armouries,Fun day out for all üòÉ free entry good for all ages. There is a gift shop and a cafe. No official car park so car park was expensive but the outdoor event was excellent. Birds of prey show was good.
215,Samurai exhibition and demonstration was brilliant!,Absolutely amazing museum packed full of interesting displays that change in a regular basis. So close to Leeds city centre please give this museum a visit and understand some of these fabulous displays.
216,Great museum!,"I took my 5 yo nephew in the summer on a day trip to Leeds, we arrived by train, walked along the canal and got to the Armouries. I had a whole day of Leeds based activities and places to go - the Armouries took over. It is free, fascinating, super well stocked with information and such variety of stuff to look at and learn about, a free 15-min demo every hour to space out the day and the demos are brilliantly performed by knowledgable staff. Upstairs there is an firing range for a small charge, there are a few cafes indoors and some very close by for more variety, and a fab gift shop. We spent all day there and took a free ferry boat back to the train station. We'll be back!!!"
217,Nice,"This is an absolutely terrific place as there are so many different things to see. There are also activities, which appeal to a wide range of people. I like the early armour, particularly that of the time of Henry V111 and Japanese artefacts. This is a real treat. There is a good cafe when ou need to have a rest."
218,A Great Surprise,Visited the Armouries on New Year's Day.Good as it is free and plenty to see.Its over 5 floors but it needs better signage .We found it hard to find the way to the next floors as there were plenty of signs saying exits but these were alarmed doors.There was a lot of dead areas where there was nothing .We were very impressed with the talks we heard especially the one on Henry Vth.The restaurant is OK but is very expensive for what you get
219,A great place to take the children.  Beautifully presented and FREE.,I can't believe this venue is free. There's many floors of things to see and do. A lot of cabinets of things to look at and a few interactive bits for kids. However given there's no entry it was great for a couple of hours. There was a reenactment on too which our boys enjoyed. Some of the interactive parts were not working downstairs. We found it very interesting and a great place to spend time as a family.
220,second time visit,So much to see and do.The museum covers armoury and equipment used in many battles over many thousand years.The miniature battlefield at the Battle of Waterloo is an incredible site.Staff are lovely.There is an indoor eating area to eat your own food.
221,Nice visit,As usual excellent display . This is a large comprehensive collection an needs a whole day. If you have specific interests it is a good idea to visit these first.
222,so much to see,"A huge museum over several floors. Free entry. The amount of artefacts in here are astounding, it really needs a few visits to take it all in. The suits of armour and samurai suits are amazing."
223,Great exhibition and it's free,Fantastic museum within walking distance of the train and bus station. Completely free entry and various activities for children to participate in. Well worth a visit.
224,"Food lovely, staff not so much ","Much more items and handguns than expected. Such an amount of items and so well organized that this museums was one of my best museumstour ever. I congestulate the staff for their excellent job creating this museum, but fist of all I congeatulate the Britons for stealing such amount from all over the worldComing to Leeds, this museum should be visited"
225,Amazing attraction and it‚Äôs FREE,"Enjoyable. Not been for a few years. Much tidier than becore. Very clean.Staff helpful and friendly.Watched the sword fight which was excellent. Daughter fired crossbows at an additional charge  and loved it (although could do with being just a touch cheaper).Tea and coffee shop was limited in what it sold but not overly expensive (apart from the crisps).Overall good access, easy car parking, clean place, kept us busy for a good couple of hours. Would go again."
226,Step back in time ,"I had time the day before my Tour De Yorkshire 2019 sportive ride to have a wonder round Leeds.  I did a lot of walking and walked up the embankment to the Leeds dock area where the museum is located at.  It's a lovely walk and it's free to go in and see all the exhibits.  There are 4 floors I think and each floor has a different galleries and themes and their own cafes and toilets.  well laid out.  I loved the oriental themed gallery.This is a great museum to visit and what is great is it is free, so take you time, roam and enjoy the exhibits.  I spent nearly 2 hours.  On your way out, you have to go through the shop and I couldn't resist a nicely decorated tube of Biscuits.Right opposite the square, there is a Pizza Express which brought a big smile to my face, Lunch was sorted.Great day out, I will definitely take my family if we come upto Leeds again."
227,Armouries,"The Royal Armouries Museum is the number 1 attraction in Leeds and its easy to see why. Brilliantly set out displays through the ages and around the world with many gorgeous exhibits, it is a must to visit when in Leeds.  Very educational, children will love it and the models of the various battles ( Waterloo ) in particular are a joy to behold.  It also has informative tours and actors playing the roles of fighters through the times. Arrive there via the Leeds River taxi makes it even more enjoyable. Thoroughly recommended. Enjoy."
228,"Kids enjoy it, it‚Äôs a free day out... but no good coffee shop!","If you like guns, violence and war then this is the place for you, if you‚Äôre not so keen maybe give it a miss! I can‚Äôt fault the museum, but my lovely sensitive daughter found it all quite upsetting."
229,Fascinating Displays,Amazing that it's free. Everyone should visit.  Great for kids . Leave a donation please. They have outside entertainment including jousting which is great fun. Inside they have archery crossbows and other things to try. They also rotate the exhibitions to keep things interesting.
230,Great Afternoon Out,"Perfect day exploring our history and the history of the world. So much to take in my brain goes on overloadCannot recommend this place enough, I do to everyone I meet!"
231,Good myseum,"Modern museum showing weapons and warfare upto 1918. Many interesting displays and models, but so many guns, swords and daggers on display that it all gets a bit overloaded.Most exhibits well annotated, but some subdued lighting makes it difficult to read in parts.Huge gift and coffee shop, and helpful staff. Plenty of tables / seating if you prefer to take your own refreshments.Make sure you attend the various demos / talks; lively and informative."
232,Visit the Armouries,"This is not the place to go if you are short of time, you do get carried away in reading the surprising and great facts that you find all over the building. A great fun way to learn English and European history."
233,Amazing Museum nr Leeds City Centre,The amount of artifacts are staggering! Beautiful displays and collections. Thoughtful plays/acts - we listened to an onstage performance of Yankee Doodle - brilliant!
234,Wonderful Museum,Visited The Royal Armouries Museum for the first time. On arrival there were actors dressed in Star Wars gear. They were so friendly they let us have a photo with them. Inside the Royal Armouries Museum there are many floors. There are stairs and lifts. The lifts are quite small. The displays are fantastic and informative. There is lot to see and it can be interactive too. You can try on the metal armour and attempt to lift a sword. There is so much to do and see - it is best to plan a whole day here. There‚Äôs a restaurant too and gift shop so take some spending money. I love this museum and would love to come back!
235,A great way to spend a couple of hours,"Had doubts about this especially with two young kids in tow. Should never have worried. Kids loved it. Plenty to keep them interested. Lots of gadgets, buttons to turn, things to look through. Plenty for the adults too. The life size models are fantastic and the whole place leads you through the ages. The hold talks at certain times of day, just overheard it really, but sounded great and not just for the adults. For a museum of deadly weapons,  it really comes to life. Excellent"
236,Educational,"My daughter had a school project on medieval jousting - rather than just looking on the internet and perhaps the library i thought it would be better to see some evidence of her project 1st hand - so off we went to Leeds on the train ! The Armouries are easy to walk to from town - and amazingly are free to get into! Each gallery and floor is packed with exhibits and information - but not in an old fashioned way , the galleries really cater for everyone - making history come alive. Whilst we were there we even saw a live combat between a Celt and a Roman! There are places to eat and also tables to eat your own picnic on , also a really good gift shop. We will definitely go again in Summer as the location by the canal is also pretty nice ."
237,Good place to visit,"My fiance and I checked the Armories out for the first time over the bank holiday, and had a really interesting afternoon out!At free entry you really get your monies worth, with weapons displays from medieval knights to modern conflicts in the Middle East. If you are into military history this is for you, or even those with a interest in a specific period (for example WW1) - there is something for you here.Demonstration on the proper use of European long swords in battle was particularly interesting part of the day! The guys really knew their stuff :)Huge purpose built car park over the road is an excellent bonus, especially for family outings.Only downside i noticed was that some of the displays were extremely dusting / worn looking, and they could probably do with keeping an eye on this so the longer term exhibits don't start looking a bit sad. The building itself is also a trifle confusing, so it is worth bearing that in mind as you occasionally find yourself on floors with no stairs and having to search out a life.Minor issues tho, and would 100% recommend."
238,Awesome collections and brilliant displays,This is a great place to visit to see outstanding presentations.There are a number of presentations during the day by members of the team that bring the history to life. Ensure you fit at least one in whilst you are there.
239,Great day out,"This is a really niche museum, not just for those interested in history but in military science. The level of depth and breadth of weapons captured from the world over is mind boggling and a bit overwhelming for an ordinary joe like me."
240,Great history,Wow what a fantastic place to visit we had a great time ...so interesting and in wonderful settings ...and all this was free ! ...restaurant also was delicious and nicely presented perfect end to a great visit .
241,Free entrance what more could you want,"Travelled with 14 year old son, mother in law of 84 and wife.Parking is via multi-storey near by, expensive but as museum itself is free it is hard to complain.Initial greeting was friendly and quickly provided a wheelchair. Lifts to all flours.Displays on floors 2-5, medieval, pike and shot, through to World War 1. Sections also on hunting with film about sustainability and oriental.Two good combat demos on two handed swords and Star Trek inspired combat. Very good monologue on War of Roses.We were there for around 3.5 hours and still didn‚Äôt cover everything.If you like to see an extensive collection of armour and weapons including ballistics and enjoy combat demos and historical stories, it is well worth a visit."
242,No structure,"I last saw the armoury contents in the Tower. Whilst the medieval arms may well look better in a castle, this museum offsets this with great displays, info and facilities.I hope that families and schools take full advantage of it. I will be going again soon."
243,"Wow, Not My Thing - But Wait",For a start this attraction is a freeby. and it really shouldn't be. the layout is wonderful and inclusive. it covers four floors and has a vast array of weapons from all over the world and from many era's. We got lost on a couple of occasions and had to backtrack to find our way. but the display is a must for education. Donations are asked for but I defy any well thinking adult to not put their hands in their pocket once they have seen the display.
244,A Very Good Day Out,"Well worth a visit, had a great day. Found a lot about the MGC from thr first world war. The children will enjoy the visit as well as the adults."
245,Fantastic,"I went to Leeds to meet up with 3 old Army friends for a 50 year reunion. We stayed at the Premier inn city center.On the Monday it was pouring with rain and we needed somewhere to go, one of my old friends had been to the Royal Armoury before and said it would be interesting to us all to have a look around. We drove to the Armoury and they had Disabled parking near enough outside the building,  others have to park in the multi storey car park which is still only a short walk. We were absolutely amazed that it was free entry . We went in at 10.00 and never came out until 16.00 what a great p.ace for a day out and at no cost.There is a reasteraunt just inside the main door and cafes on nearly all floors of which there is 5, one floor has a picnic area with plenty of seating and drink machines. We all agreed that it was a great day out and would definitely go again the displays are truly great and will keep you interested for the day. And on top of this 2 of us took our wives with us, thinking they would be bored stiff but they both enjoyed it as much as all the men did. If your in Leeds it's a must, even if not our group were 1 from Lincoln 1 from South end on sea 1 from Southport and one from the Wirral.  So it's not so far that you would be disappointed in a day or weekend visit for no cost but accomadation."
246,Conference ,"Sort of place which would have made a good school trip, lots of armour (big surprise) and the sword display is a site to be seen."
247,Lots to see with excellent information,Awesome if you're a history buff. The collection is not too expansive but is well presented and gives a great insight into the historic areas of weapons development with respect to UK history. Really is super if you also know the socio economic and class metamorpasis during the different eras.
248,A day can easily be filled. ,"Now what a grand surprise my visit to this wonderful place was.  I was completely taken with the architecture, the magnificent displays, the wonderful help the docents offered, and I so enjoyed my day.  I intended - perhaps like most - to see the Elephant Armour and the Henry VIII Armour.  Well - not so bloody fast.  I was completely taken with the fourth floor. The amazing armour from all over Asia was truly a spectacle.  Then floor after floor.  Now I admit some of the content held very little interest, nonetheless, worth a glance.  Even the vampire kit - was amazing.  Truly a museum not to be missed while in Leeds.  I cannot recommend it enough."
249,Fascinating museum with lots to see,It is a lovely museum with a big range of armouries starting from stones till today. Also you can find a selection of knives and guns from famous movies as well. I also loved trying crossbow.
250,A sword is just a sword isn‚Äôt it?,"My 5 year old loves the place. After a few visits ive seen all the swords I‚Äôll ever need to see. The knights on horse back were amazing but expensive for a family of 5 and the queues were ridiculously long, for an hour before it even started (shakes head) its a place you must visit if your in Leeds but maybe not too often."
251,family over it,This is a remarkably good place to visit. No expense has been spared to fill five floors with wonderful exhibits. My grandson was thrilled with the dramatic presentation of sword fighting. All is totally free - fantastic place to visit!
252,"War, what is it good for?",What a delight to meet so many connections in this wonderful venue.  So much to see and the food is excellent.
253,Brilliant,"Went to visit my son in Leeds with my husband and he took us to the Museum. I thought it would be a bit boring but far from it. It was great, the best was the Viking actor who told story that had us all glued to our seats. I have never seen so many guns in my life. Any child will love this place and the history they tell through the generations, So many children walking around with there family enjoying it as much as we did. Great day out."
254,Worthy of a visit,"Fabulous place! Really, really interesting. Well laid out & exhibited. Every one should visit, especially if you have children. Look forward to our next visit"
255,One of the Best Museums in the Area,how many places do you get like this stacked with things to see and so well presented and it's FREE. I would just say being a drink and Sandwich as I was disappointed with the coffee. but it was an amazing place well worth a visit or three
256,Great value and interest!,"It feels like you are travelling through time. The place is really dirty. Ex. there are an elephant and a tiger. The tiger seems yellow, full of dust. However, the place is really interesting."
257,Interesting,"Honestly loved this. Been meaning to come for a year, I can't believe it's free (although we did make a donation). The guys dressed up were incredibly knowledgeable and friendly, learned loads extra to what was written down. The only negative was I was reprimanded rudely by a female member of staff in the gift shop for not wearing a face mask, despite being medically exempt. Extremely rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing visit and I will definitely return"
258,Well worth a visit.,"Lots to see and do in this museum of weapons.  Hours and hours of fun finding out interesting facts, viewing artefacts or seeing live action demonstrations not to mention the shot at using a crossbow - take the gold elevator!!!"
259,lovely day out in leeds dock - museum and Mumtaz Leeds best Eid ever,This museum is very well organized and beautiful.  The subject matter is very well presented.  We choose to do this museum because it was a rainy day and I am glad it rained.  We learned a lot and enjoyed it very much.
260,The best war & armour museum I've been so far,"Visited in August whilst in Leeds. Excellent museum (free) with a huge amount to see. A great live presentation on the battle of Flodden and brilliant dioramas, displays of armour and weapons. Highly recommended."
261,Excellent,"something you rarely get to experience, especially on your doorstep. well done to the government for letting us have this in leeds"
262,Spanish armada,"This museum is really first class and would require many visits to take it all in, if you were that keen.  About 3 hours would be enough,  but I was fortunate to see live demonstrations by actors/staff? on mediaeval sword fighting and also rifles/pistols/revolvers as they evolved from the Wild West to the 20th Century.  These presentations were very professional and very lively, captivating the whole audience.This was my 2nd visit, and I enjoyed it even more than last time. Good views of Leeds Dock, the River Aire and Calder Main Line Canal and water taxis from the large windows on the 4 upper floors.  As a bonus, it‚Äôs all free - you can even sit at tables and eat your own food if you wish."
263,Great day out,"Good looking place  for a snack. The terrace, particularly, overlooks the canal boat  marina.Delicious looking salads but it is not obvious from menu how to order them. I chose my pastrami pickle mustard cheese bagel from The Premium sandwiches range. From the salad bar you get one spoonful of lettuce and one spoonful of a choice of salads beans, tomatoes and potatoes.The lettuce was old very old, I mean it could of been 2-3 days old. the bagel too was not fresh; thick and doughie. The other ingredients were fresh though and tasty. A well stocked bar included teas and coffee. Easy access for buggies and wheelchairs."
264,Free for all.!,I visited this museum when I was moving to Leeds and I'm quite passionate about history and war. It really is big and there is a lot to see from different cultures and historical periods.It's entertaining for kids too.Highly recommended
265,A fantastic day out! ,"If you have kids that are into armour and battles .... but then again you dont need to be a kid! The Royal Armouries is a regional branch (though in reality it is the main collection) of the Royal collection of arms and armour, othe r parts  being on display at the Tower of London and Fort Nelson. There are displays of combat, at times jousting tournaments and different exhibitions. The weaponry on show is not all antiquities, muskets, chain mail and the like... the conflicts of the 20th century and the 21st are covered with their weaponry nad armour also. Its easily accessible on foot from Leeds city centre or by boat from the train station for a slightly differnt way of approaching it. Its a national collection so is FREE to enter (but do donate!)"
266,Fantastic museum,"I have a teenage son who loves history of any kind, so it was a given that he would love this museum. My teenage daughter really doesn‚Äôt enjoy history, so I expected to be hearing that she was ready to leave after 20 minutes. After 3 hours, she finally told me her brain had absorbed all it could handle. The museum is set up in such a brilliant manner that you want to keep looking and can‚Äôt get enough even though there is so much to see. We all really enjoyed our 3+ hours. We‚Äôd probably go back if given the chance-especially my history loving son."
267,Great Day out,"This is one of the places that I visited when I first came to Leeds.It's magnificent, spacious and splendid.A lot of armours and other war weapons to see.The place is gothic yet modern.It's also beside the cannel where you can take a boat trip to the train station.Overall, it's a combination of various landmarks in Leeds."
268,Good museum,"Modern museum laid out on 5 floors. Free entry, and a large car park (you have to pay) nearby, so very accessible. It was interesting... up to a point. Unless you are a real gun and sword enthusiast you will get enough of five floors of continuous relentless displays of these weapons. I would say about two floors of this is enough. Don't be too surprised if the kids play up after an hour. Museum displayed  many videos with occasional live talks. Restaurant was expensive with baguettes at ¬£7 to ¬£8.50. Worth a visit for an hour or so."
269,Night away,What an absolute surprise this place was! Five floors to visit with exceptional displays everywhere.   A beautifully kept place.  So interesting. Free to enter too. Highly recommend this place to suit all ages.
270,Vast History!,"This is the ultimate museum to visit with my husband and son.  What other museum in the world has a crossbow range?  That alone would make this place worth a visit, but then just the breadth and depth of the arms and armor collection makes it a must see in Leeds.  If you can imagine a weapon, it's here.  There are historical and cultural exhibits, thematic exhbits, interactive areas, videos, everything.  You can simply stroll through, or take your time and really connect with the works.  And the best thing is that it is free, and in a really wonderful building in a cool part of the city."
271,DAY VISIT,Great day out and very impressive collection. You will need a few hours to truly admire what it has.
272,History,"This is an excellent museum. There are excellent displays, some with interactive elements. There are regular displays throughout the day which appeal to young & old alike. It‚Äôs situation close to the Aire & Calder Navigation affords excellent views over Leeds city centre. Admission is free with a suggested donation of ¬£5, there are two cafes with reasonably priced food & also am area to eat your own picnic. Our only criticism is that the signage could be improved."
273,2 Years since our last visit but even BETTER,"I was a little unsure as to what to expect from the royal armouries, however I must say I was very impressed.The armouries have plenty on offer for you to see, with a wide variety of different weapons and uniforms. I will be going again in the future."
274,Great family visit,"Last time I visited the Royal armoury it was based at ROFNottingham. It is now based in the Leeds docks area. If you don't know Leeds very well get to the central bus station and follow The Call, see map at bus station. You will eventually pick up the usual brown tourist attraction sign posts. You will need to cross the River Aire by footbridge and need to go the the car end of the Armouries building to gain entry. Entrance is free and there are plenty of guides to show you around, if required. The exhibition is spread over five floors but there are plenty of lifts as well as stairs and ramps. As well as the obvious exhibits there is a snack bar, cafe and shop."
275,Worth a visit once ,"Had a great day at the royal armouries. My grand-daughter was fascinated. A free fun day out had by all. Lovely cafe, with a view of the canal. Look forward to visiting again this year"
276,World Class Museum,"The museum has great exhibitions and amazing shows//demos//tutorial sessions. The water taxi, from the train station to the armories museum,  costs only 1 pound per person. The water taxi station is near the south entrance of the train station, a bit difficult to find the place."
277,Always a great day out,Haven‚Äôt been here since I was young with my parents. Lots to see and do. Didn‚Äôt get round all of it and going again soon
278,Lucky to have this in leeds,It's just boring. There's nothing interactive to do. The kids were bored. We were bored. The staff looked bored. Even the kids' playroom that used to be there has disappeared. Completely boring
279,Great location,What a wonderful place this is. You could spend a day here easily. If you brink your own food you can sit in the grounds. The cafe is very good also. The museum is fantastic and has something for everyone. It‚Äôs so well laid out. It‚Äôs accessible for everyone. The staff are very friendly. A must visit if you are in Leeds.
280,Well worth a visit!,"It is a museum of weapons and armor. Most of it was located in the London Tower, being the oldest museum in the country. Admission is free."
281,Re visit after a few years,"My husband wanted to visit while we were on holiday in Harrogate. It wouldn‚Äôt have been my first choice but I was totally overwhelmed! I could have happily gone back the next day. The displays are stunning and the events are really fantastic. Well done to all the talented actors/demonstrators/experts who made the day even better! Make sure you leave a whole day for this museum, you‚Äôll need it!"
282,Fantastic but... ,a purpose built building only a 30 minute stroll from Leeds Station or a 12 minute trip on the River Taxi.An astonishing collection is on show spread across 5 floors; there is a cafe and shop on the ground floor  Access is good via lifts or stairs and there are a number of seating areas on each floor looking out over Leeds Dock which is a great idea. There are various shows and talks at timed slots .We attended a one man show about the Battle of Balaclava --it was excellent.The friendly staff are really helpful.
283,Even my teenage daughter who isn‚Äôt a history fan enjoyed this location ,"A nice museum in a nice part of town, can go for a nice stroll along the river and stop off to look at some swords in a quiet museum!"
284,Absolutely in love with this place,"Free entry and if you park nearby there is free parking on the street for 2 hours. For a longer visit use the car parks. Too many artefacts to see in one visit so limit yourself to a couple of floors before returning  ata  later date. Exhibitions and demonstrations, especially in the tilt yard are worthwhile. Great day out."
285,Truly Amazing,This is a must visit for young and old.The variety of historical artefacts and exhibitions is fantastic.Great facilities and access for disabled persons.Thougherly enjoyed our visit.
286,Well worth seeing,"To answer the above question; for making excellent exhibits at the Royal Armouries Museum. This is a great place, me and the Mrs spent about 3 hours there but I could have spent half a day there easily. It has a crossbow range too where you can fire a crossbow. It was ace!"
287,Fantastic,"This is the Royal Armouries Museum, even though it's in Leeds Leeds! ...and it's Free Entry as it's a National Museum.It's an incredible collection of Military and Historic Arms from around the world and all well documented.They also do live action talks and discussions (sometimes in costumes of the time). There is an outside arena where exhibitions and shows are held during the year but there is a small fee for these events.There is also a restaurant and Souvenir shop.There is a fee paying Car Park on site.  All in all its a good day out and very interesting."
288,Love this place ,"Brought my teenage sons here for a return journey. We usually make a trip from Hull to Leeds Armouries every year or two, and everytime we come we feel that there is so much to look at and discover. Despite its compact footprint, it packs a lot into its 5 sprawling floors - everything from caveman spears, though medieval swords and spears, and all the way to sci-fi blasters from a well known movie franchise in a galaxy far, far away. We jusy 'popped' in, and next thing we knew we had been there for 5hrs!!! Thankfully there are places for refreshments and evern some places to sit if you have brought some picnic provisions. Whilst it is free admission, I highly recommend giving a little of what you can to help keep the upkeep of this amazing place so that future generations can continue to enjoy it for a long time to come."
289,for all who love a bit of cathartic killing and maiming!,I've come here a few times and love it every single time. Definitely a great place to bring children as there is so much to see and learn. I love seeing all the old costumes!
290,Full Day Activity,This must be one of the best presented museums in the UK.All the exhibits are very clearly identified and displayed.Expect to spend at least 3 hours here. You could be here all day.
291,very good,"You don't have to be nuts about weapons to enjoy a visit to this museum.The hall of steel is stunning- a mirrored tower rising 4 storeys lined with weapons.From there,you can visit 4 floors showcasing the history and development of weaponry.The displays not only focus on the functionality of the equipment,but also on the artistry possible.It ranges from suits of armour right through to the modern day.It is very easy to spend a couple of hours here"
292,so big it takes a few days and it's free,"At first, i thought this will be a bad idea. Then it actually took me by surprise and became a good time out, me and my friend who lives inleeds recommended this place and it were clean, staff friendly, interesting. Also had a cafe, shop and every few hours small classes where you can learn about the different suits and weapons used. Will be expressing my thought to friends and family."
293,Great day out,"What a great trip, really well worth the visit. What an enjoyable few hours we had. If you want a rest from the extensive shopping that Leeds has to offer then this is definitely the place to go.  What a great building. Fantastic exhibits and shows put on by museum staff. Really very good indeed"
294,Excellent and free,"Great place to visit, any time if the year....... take your own food. Plenty to see & do & all free. Great. Kids, adults, young & old"
295,Impressive..and free ;-),Me and my friend support two lads who have autism. We took them to this museum for a day out. We watched Andy and Tom‚Äôs talks and mini shows. The lads we support find it difficult to sit still and engage but they enjoyed the roles that Andy and Tom performed and sat through 3. Andy‚Äôs last performance was him telling a tale on his own which we didn‚Äôt think the lads would sit through but they did and one of them even took his ear defenders off to listen. This is massive. A big well done to Andy and Tom üòÄ made our visit fantastic to see The happiness in the lads faces as they watched.
296,Worth to see,"This museum is housed in an impressive building. The collections are extensive and well displayed. The facilities in the museum, cafe , shop etc are good."
297,Fab museum,"On the one hand, this is a fantastic museum with a great collection and live demonstrations. On the other hand, if you suffer from allergies, you had better bring your food and anything else you need with you. Leeds dock seems to be that little bit off the beaten path; so when you arrive, you're likely going to be in the museum for the whole day."
298,Family orientated,"The Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds is an absolutely excellent and World class museum.The exhibits are comprehensive and well arranged. The collections of oriental and especially Japanese arms and armour are truly brilliant. I liked the full size Japanese tea house on display.The building itself is nice designed, and the surrounding district of Leeds is modern and attractive. The only problem is it's a little bit difficult to find from the centre of Leeds."
299,Very good.,"You don't have to be a serial killer, psychopath or warmonger to want to have a look round this museum. There are several floors of stunning displays from medieval knights in armour to modern day soldiers. Whether you want to see Police equipment, horse armour, oriental warriors or hunting scenes, it's all here.  There are cafes on different floors, a large gift shop, a crossbow range where you can have ago, live presentations and quiet seating areas to take a break whilst looking out of the large windows over Leeds dock.  To top it all ... IT'S FREE but don't forget to pop a donation into one of the boxes on the way out."
