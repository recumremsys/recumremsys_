0,100% Cuteness,"Nara is a small town on a Japaneese scale with just over 360 000 inhabitants, 40 minutes by train from Osaka. The city was Japan's first capital under the name Heijo-Kyō and 8 of the city's temples are today on the UNESCO World Heritage List.Nara Park. Where do I start! The park was established in 1880 and is one of Japan's oldest parks. The park houses several major attractions such as Todaiji Temple and Kasuga Taisha Shrine. Well over 1000 fallow deer also live here! In ancient times the deer was seen as saints and as helpers for the Gods and were well taken care of. They are still well taken care of. The fallow deers in Nara Park are wild and completely able to find food on their own. But, you can buy special fallow biscuits (shika senbei) to feed them if you want. The foundation that organizes this donates the profit to take care of the deers in the park. Many of the deers have learned to bow to ask for biscuits and they are just so incredible cute. The park itself is beautful and I can highly reccomend to spend 2-4 hours in the park - especially if you love fallow deers as much as I do :-)"
1,Filled With Deer and People,"Nara is an amazing city, probably the nicest in Japan. Over 1.000 deers are walking on the streets and in the park and you can feed them or play with them. The temple is amazing and the entire atmosphere is really great."
2,Extraordinary Park to visit - Unique even,"The park is beautiful, deer are very cute and it was only a short train ride from Osaka, the Japan Rail Pass covered the ticket from Osaka station. There were more deer then I thought there would be! Make sure to bow at them, as they will bow back (usually if you have food for them). When we got the biscuits a lot of deer did run up to us, so just be aware of that. But they just want your biscuits!"
3,"Not a destination in itself, more like a path between temples and shrines","Nara is ca 40 min metro ride from Osaka. Nara is famous for its park, full of deers and the temple.Be careful of deers, especially if you have those cakes that are sold and deer seem to love. The deer easily check your pockets and ones with horns can push quite aggressively. Bowing is important for Japanese and these deer can bow for the cakes.Visit also Todai-ji Temple and others.Summary: Very nice with children, however deers are wild life and unpredictable."
4,So many friendly deer 🦌,From Kyoto take the fastest train--35 minutes called the Kintetsu.  There are over 1000 tame deep walking in the park and streets and pretty friendly--but Let the others pet them!Temples and the Largest wooden buddah and a few shrines.  About 20.00 dollars round trip and modern train takes you right there( May make one stop) easy -fun -cheap and you don't get stuck on a tour bus.  When you get there they have a free map of the area--Also many restaurants and some shops
5,Happy Japan trip,"Well worth a trip. Nara is very easily accessible from both Kyoto and Osaka by train. Can be done as a day trip but you may consider spending the night as there is plenty to see in Nara. Museums, cafes and plenty of scenic walks (with deer of course). The park is full of friendly deer. You can buy deer cookies to feed them. The deer will even bow before you feed them. They also love their photo being taken."
6,Beautiful park,"Nara park is the biggest and best natural park in Nara, Japan. We went on a holiday which means so many people. The parking place was quite far. Going to the park, there is a museum, deer park and temple. The deer comes from the mountain where they sleep, then they go to the park. These deer are so friendly, and the park sells biscuits for you to feed them.it is a very unique experience. The park is also so clean. This is a must see while in Osaka. It is about 1 hour from Osaka. Highly recomended."
7,Great day trip from Osaka,"Nara park is one of the main tourist spots in Japan as who would not love to walk among deer? After a few stops on the train, we arrived at Nara to visit the deer park. Just before the ascent to the park, you will find a famous shop making mochi where the guy beats his hands between the hammer and the mochi, which was quite entertaining. The park is huge, free to get in and full of deer. Yes, there is a musk smell and you still have to be wary of a wild animal but it's beautiful. There are plenty of temples, gardens but the most entertaining is letting the deers bow their heads in respect twice before excepting food.A great day out and well worth the visit"
8,Great day out. Love feeding the deers,I visited Nara as a day trip from Kyoto.  It's about an hour by train.  This is a nice park to have a walk in spring.  The deer in the park are an attraction.  It's fun to watch.  Search for the quieter places to escape the crowds.
9,Fantastic fun experience ,"We spent a day exploring Nara and it's beauty. The park is a short 15minute walk from the JR station. Once we entered the park we were immediately overwhelmed with the welcoming deer. They are extremely friendly and always looking for food. You can buy some deer snacks from the vendors for 200yen, only feed the deer the deer snacks, otherwise they can get sick. The park is large with many trees and very useful maps. Naras most popular temples and shrines are dotted around the parimeter. We would recommend exploring this area on a day trip from Kyoto."
10,Love walking around and meeting all the deer ,"This park's nearest station is Kintetsu-Nara Station. From the station, it is about 10 to 15 mins walk till you hit the inner park. There are a lot of deers roaming around freely for you to feed. Along the path from the station, there will be some vendors selling the biscuits that you can buy to feed the deers. Some deers are really hungry and aggressive and they see your stack of biscuits.It's a good place to visit and walk around the park and I feel that overall it is a fun experience. Try bowing to the deers and they will follow you. Best to take some boomerang photos.The park also leads to the Todaiji Temple but do note it is quite a walk. Use Google maps to navigate."
11,A lot of park and a lot of deer,"Nara has some lovely hidden spots, some great gardens and the main shrines. However, there are busy roads running up to and in the park and significant crowds which detract from the experience. I was hoping for more of the history of the site but it was overwhelmed by the hordes of people only interested in taking selfies with the deer!"
12,"ANCIENT and original seat of Japan, before Kyoto, Tokyo , lovely even in winter",This is the centre piece of Nara as its among many of famous tourist attractions. Its close to the bustops from the Station and very close to the Todaiji temple and the start of the walk to the Kasuga shrine.Its got a lot of kiosks on the side but its main attraction is the deer which walk around unmolested. They are quite used to tourist food and can be quite aggressive.I was butted by a stag for no particular reason! They are all quite dirty as though outdoors its not really a forest.
13,Amazing Shrine and deer who will bow to u.,I thought the journey  by train and walk through town up to the park was great very old world Japan peaceful town. The park itself is great big beautiful sculpted however very very crowded the feet are annoying feet poo everywhere . Very over rated
14,One of the highlights of our trip,"Nara Park is a train ride from the centre of Kyoto, but well worth the trip. Deer roam freely and nod their heads, Japanese style, when offered food which is really cute. They are not the real reason to go - that's to see the various world heritage sites all in one place. There are magnificent temples and the huge golden buddhas."
15,A Must Visit,"Nara is a magical place full of beautiful shrines , amazing temples and most interestingly friendly deers . We went in autumn season which was highlighted with colorful autumn leaves . One can touch and feed deers with the biscuits provided everywhere . Everything closes by 5 or 6 p.m , so try to start your trip early if you are going just for a day trip ."
16,Deer central!,Nara Park near to the temple was really a nice spot for visitors of all ages.  It was particularly beautiful during autumn period with the fall colors around.  Visitors would spend time taking photos around as well as spend some money to purchase biscuits for feeding the deers in the park. Highly recommended.
17,Come for the deer,"From the nearest train station (Kintetsu Nara Station) all the way to the park was an experience in itself. There's a local shop which sells and make super delicious mochi on the spot so its piping hot and ohh so delicious! Its was a perfect day, sunny and not so cold to feed the wild deers that roam about happily in the park. They do get frisky if you don't feed them and some may butt your ass.. hahaha! Nearby temples are picturesque for those trigger happy fingers."
18,Lots of Deer!,"A wonderful space, famous for it tame deer. It also links many of the Nara's attractions so come prepared to walk."
19,The Aggressive Deer Spoil it,Had a great time on our day trip to Nara from Kyoto.  It was a short 45 minute ride from Kyoto Station using the JR line. No need to make seat reservations. Visited the temple which was nice but we didn’t bother paying to go in since we have been to so many temples already. We saw lots of deer in the park. Some of the deer can get pretty aggressive when you feed them by nipping in your clothing to get your attention. It seems that the deer that were further into the park were better behaved so I would bypass the initial crowds and go closer to the museum. It was real cute to see some of the deer bow in order to get the cracker. I wasn’t able to do it but saw some who did. Museum was pretty good as well.
20,beautiful park with amazing landscape,Nara park is a must visit if you’re around Kyoto/Osaka area. You can visit the deer in the park or walk to the nearby Todai-ji temple where there are more deer. Buy the crackers (only thing you should feed the deer) and allow them to bow their heads for some crackers. Hint do not show them all your crackers and if they become aggressive show them your empty hands. They are very used to humans. The male deer have their antlers cut off (sadly) so they cannot hurt humans. Do not run from the deer they will chase you! Overall good experience.
21,Soooo many deers,"Going to Nara Park is a must do if you are in Kansai area. We went on a day trip on our own, riding the train from Kyoto to Nara. A few minutes walk from the train station, we experienced our 1st encounter with the deers who were just lazing around waiting for people to feed them. Walking thru the large expanse of the park, we encountered more deer and took some great shots of them and with them while feeding them.  It was our first time to experience being with deers unhampered by fences like you see in the zoo. Overall, an experience not to be missed."
22,Beware of the deer,"You could couple a visit here with a visit to Fushimi Inari as they are on the same JR line but whilst Nara looks like a nice spot to stop for a while I wouldn't be going just for the deer. There are cute deer and you can pat, be photographed with and feed them but it wasn't worth the 2 + hrs form Kyoto for mine. Good perhaps with younger kids.The park is nice enough for a stroll and there are some museums/exhibitions and temples.It's a 1+hr train trip on the JR line from Kyoto. The Local train is tedious as it stops at all 19 stations - organise yourself to catch the Rapid.One sheep, two sheep - one deer, lots of deer....my dears."
23,Bold Fallow Deers,"We took the commuter train from Osaka to Nara station. Another 14 minutes walk , just follow the crowd , and you reach the park. So many places, temples and a museum to see, you should take as a minimum a half day. When you are there, meet the deers."
24,A park in the traditional zone,"Caught the Train up here from Osaka and walked from JR Nara Station - almost directly due East - up a wide quite modern Avenue, then past the 3-Storye Pagoda, the Kofukuji Temple, then the 5-Storey Pagoda, then came to the Park.I was not ready for the Herds of Bowing (sic) Deer, hundreds of people feeding them and hawkers selling packets of Deer Pellets. Apparently they are sacred (hence all the 'bowingb - it's done by people, not Deer), so everything is tolerated and they (the Deer) know it. They also stick their cute noses everywhere trying to find something else to eat, so after the novelty wears-off, and you have the cute shot, they are a darned pest  and one has to look where one treads, as despite the sweepers best efforts, they produce more than anyone had bargained-for.There are some shrines, pagodas and temples for good measure, but all were mobbed by people, deer, tourists and School Groups on Tours - the Japanese love organised Tours.It will take a while to get round, due to the Deer, Mob of people and Entrance Queues."
25,Deer encounters ,nara & todaiji temple made for an excellent day trip from Kyoto. The children loved feeding the deers special crackers & bowing.
26,Good area to walk with deer ,"Would definitely recommend visiting Nara during a visit to Japan. The park here is filled with friendly deer, interesting temples, and a peaceful botanical garden. You can purchase deer crackers for 200yen to feed the deer from many places in the park, you can't miss them!Todai-Ji Temple is a must see whilst here. You can even squeeze through a hole in one of the ancient posts to become (more) enlightened!One of the highlights of our trip!"
27,Nicest park Ive been so far,"Nara Park is one of the must-see areas in Nara City. Sika deer who are considered messengers of the gods freely live in the park. Most reasons of tourists to visit Nara Park is coming close, taking photos and feeding the deer with ""Sembe"" (deer cracker). Most of them who have been cut antler are hungry all times. Some of them  bite or bow to visitors to ask for food, steal food from hand, bite the hands while feeding. Be careful walking on deer stools and walking up to the deer and take a photograph with them or feed them with deer crackers."
28,Interesting,"Nara Park is a great place to visit.  Deer roam everywhere in the city.  You can get special crunchy food for them at the stand.  It smells good, but do not eat it. It is for deer only!!  And say ""bow"" before you feed them.  Amazingly they understand English!! They will bow before eat it.  After feeding them, be sure you go to Nara machi, where you can see the houses people lived in 150 years ago.  On the way to Nara machi, you may see the famous rice cracker  performance!!  東大寺、興福寺、依水園はたくさんの人が訪れますが、奈良町はまだあまり観光客が訪れていないように感じます。"
29,Great day trip choice from Osaka. Lots of tame deer roaming around.,"Nara park isn’t far from the station and on a hot day a lot of it is under shade. The deer are very friendly and I was happy to see that the way people were interacting with them was ethical. You can buy the crackers for 150 JPY. The deer will ‘bow’ (some just do a head nod) for a bit of biscuit. Be careful, once they know you’ve got biscuits they can get a bit Pushy! It was lots of fun and a great low cost activity. We took he train from Kyoto, and we thought it was definitely worth the trip!"
30,Dont buy the biscuits,"The walk uphill from the train station through narrow streets does not prepare you for the expansive Nara Park, full of beautiful gardens, shrines lakes and of course the deer. We were marginally early for the cherry blossoms but there were still lots of beautiful plum blossoms. When you buy food for the deer from one of the many vendors, keep it out of sight and feed isolated individual deer. Otherwise you will be ""mugged"" and pushed around by numerous deer that forget their manners and have no intention of bowing for their reward. The Todaji Temple is also worth seeing."
31,Not Bambi! And Don't Touch - I got Deer Mites!,"Nara Park is not a specific location. Asking where to find deer in Nara is like asking where can you find water in the Pacific. They’re literally everywhere in the temples complex. Just go to Todai-ji temple and the entrance is filled with deers trying to come and lick you. The park adjacent to it and covering a large part of Nara city’s central area is full of deers. You can feed them if you wish. There are many hawkers selling deer snacks for 100 yen, and giving them snacks causes them to congregate. You don’t necessarily need to walk in this park to enjoy feeding the deers, it’s just a very nice preserved attraction by the city of Nara to enjoy time with these cute animals."
32,"Fun, deers are well looked after","Great day trip and worth a visit purely for the todeji and deer park. No where else have I seen deer so tame and willing to come near and interact with humans. If you now and choose the right temperment of deer you’re bound to get a good shot! For example some of the deer at the entrances were a bit more aggressive in their persistent of deer biscuits (150 yen a small pack) , outside the temple around the park there were smaller deer and if you bowed at them they bowed back (for a biscuit of course)! Then again the deer are wild sod don’t be surprised if they push or nip you (don’t worry about the teeth )"
33,"Deers, deers, deers","Nara is a big touristic town, but I don't think its worth it. The deers are interesting for the first half an hour, but they are so trained that it is not like seeing them in nature. The park is cultivated and many tourists and tourists traps (sovenir shops etc). I don't think nara is worth the trip, especially when you have do many Temples in Kyoto..."
34,Advice below on how to avoid an aggressive deer.,"Nara is set up like a mainland chinese grid of an old city, which it tried to mimic, making it very pedestrian friendly, to get around, Forget taxis, just walk, if you are lucky you do run thru the deer park"
35,VERY aggressive deer,"This is a great day out from either Kyoto or Osaka. The deers are free range however they seem to hangout in one area near the bus station. We had a 6 month in tow, handy to know the bus station has a full baby feeding area. Great fun, just watch little ones around the deers at all times. Temples are great here. (Side note, when we got off the train it seemed like a lady tried to hussle us a “guided tour”. Easily shutdown and unusual for Japan)"
36,Friendly deer,"Easy train ride from osaka (or kyoto) for a day trip. Love the deer, and they are everywhere. If you want to get away from the crowds go further up. We loved feeding the deer (and yes they can get very aggressive once they know you have food). If that distresses you, dont buy the biscuits, and they pretty much give you a sniff at most then leave you alone.We also went to Todaji temple which was huge and very impressive. Worth the entry price. This is the second time i’ve been to nara while visiting japan. Still love it."
37,Home of the deer,Lovely tour of Nara Park and Yoshi.  The temple and grounds are lovely.  The deer are the true caretakers of the area....they are truely the messengers of the gods.
38,Interact with deers!!!,"small but beautiful city,it was so clean and lovely. you can see cute deer everywhere.if you can wake up soon and go outside for walking in the morning....."
39,Super Nice,"Nara deer park is unique and well worth a visit. There are deer roaming everywhere, even in the middle of roads!You can pat and feed the deer. Be warned that they will mob you and push you around when they see you buy a pack of biscuits, this can be overwhelming for small children. The general Nara area has nice to walk around and the train ride there has interesting scenery. My only negative - I’m not sure how healthy it is for the deer to be eating biscuits all day every day."
40,beautiful place,"Nara Park offers a nature encounter unlike any other in Japan. Hundreds of deer, regarded as messengers of the gods in the Shinto religion, roam freely in the park. Being able to interact with them is almost like a spiritual experience. The deer are tame and affectionate, and can be fed by visitors with biscuits sold by vendors at the park. The adjacent Todai-ji temple is a stone's throw away. The park is easily accessible by public transportation. Highly recommended."
41,Nara Park ,"nice place to relax, pet friendly deer, feed them and take a strall towards the Todaiji temple.lots of photo opportunities"
42,Beautiful,"Nara is famous for the deer that wander around the area, not just at Nara Park. The deer are generally friendly, but perhaps due to frequent feeding by tourists (you get to buy food for them at 200Y, as part of their fund-raising efforts in the deer conservation), they could get a little aggressive and sniff you for food."
43,Deers galore,We visited Nara Park and the Kasuga - taisha Shrine on a lovely sunny spring day. Feeding the sacred deer was cool. They are everywhere and are very friendly and a bit cheeky. Buy a few biscuits from the local vendors for about $2.00 AUD. Stand in front of a deer and the deer will bow to you prior to getting a feed. The park is manicured and has history. It’s a really nice place. The deer will give your clothes a nip if they don’t get a biscuit but they don’t hurt. The walk uphill to the shrine is pretty easy and you’ll pass stone lanterns on the way. These lanterns hold peoples wishes which they light in fire. I’d recommend this spot to visit for a few hours.
44,Go for a rickshaw with kotobukiya( red shirt),"Nara Park is quite large. In addition to tourists, you'll meet tons of deers. They're wild, but very friendly. Inside the park, you have grass areas, small rivers and creeks, temples... Really nice. However, it's quite full of people. It's a good idea to sleep in Nara and enjoy the park early morning on your own, avoiding people coming on a day trip."
45,"Peaceful, Beautiful and lots of Deer","A visit to Japan wouldn’t be complete without feeding the deer in Nara. The ""deer cookies"" are sold throughout the park and can be fed to the deer. You have to raise your hand with the cookie first, wait for them to bow, and then feed it. They are so adorable when they bow! Aside from the deer, there are a lot of cherry blossoms trees in the area. It was a windy day when we went and we witnessed a Hanafubuki (raining cherry blossoms). It was really magical!"
46,A beautiful autumn day,The deer at Nara park roam around freely and seek food from visitors. It can get very busy in Nara but still worthwhile checking out these deer.
47,A fun place to visit!,"Really enjoyed nara park. Full of deers everywhere. Also full of temples and shrines in every street. The park is very big, it's hard to tell where you are. Enjoyable to walk and feed the deers."
48,Absolutely beautiful place with deers running around,The park here is clean and deer roam freely. You can feed them for 200 yen. There are lots of impressive temples hidden throughout as well.
49,Great experience with Nara deer,It was very relaxing park to visit with beautiful falling leaves and deers. It’s a walking distance to vist famous temples and a museum.
50,A wonderful day trip for the family,"Visited the park in mid Jan and was charged 200 yen for deer biscuits. Although wild, the deers are so used to Humans they almost seem docile, just minding their own business in this protected park. Animal instincts kick in when it comes to feeding with some, so conditioned, they have learn to bow for their treats.Just a tip, if you get tired from walking, a one way or one stop bus trip to both the train stations cost 220 yen. Although the JR passes are not valid with regards to bus use, those with Suica or ic cards can use them. Allocate between 3 to 4 hours to visit this attraction. Its a beautiful place."
51,Loved feeding the deer!,"It is one of the best highlights of my Japan trip. You have to stay at Nara Park half day or whole day to enjoy the deer. Beware of those deers with horns as they will run into you if they see you have food. You have to show them your hands are empty so they will stop attacking you. But overall, twas a nice experience. I stayed at the park the whole day just to enjoy na nature and the deer. Very relaxing exeperience."
52,Amazing,"Nara Park is a must to see and it's huge. Been there last month and the different colors and shapes of the trees and leafs are just simply unique, so as the view. If you go when there is not a big crowd, then even better because you can enjoy the peacefulness of the park. Plenty of cute deers that you can feed. There are local people selling the proper snack so you can feed the deers and it's pretty cheap and reminds me a thin smelly waffle. But 1st do show respect and do a small bow to the deers before you feed them. They will do the same. It's amazing and fun!!There are signs as well, to be careful with them as even though they are cute, you can't forget that they are wild animals and walk freely. Probably I don't have to write it, but ....Please do respect this beautiful place and don't trow any of your garbage on the floor as the deer might eat it and you will be spoiling a beautiful place.Better take a little bag for your garbage and then bin. I took a plastic bag from a deer's mouth, that was trying to eat it. Not cool."
53,"Come for the deer, stay for the park","The big attraction are the deers in the Nara Park, almost 1200 of them spread over the natural surroundings of the Nara Park. As one starts walking from the parking area to the Buddha temple, one can find all the deers around. One can buy crackers for 150 jpy each packet (has about 6 crackers) that the deers seem to love. Of course one has to be careful because the deers do come on their own very close to get the crackers but the miraculous part is that these are “bowing deers” .. you bow to them and they bow back! And then have the cracker ! Pretty amazing! I remember one of the deers bit me a little as I wasn’t paying attention to giving it a cracker :) so one has to be a little careful but overall a fantastic experience ! It’s an open space, when we went it was very crowded but since it’s a vast open space it helped ! Great experience !"
54,Returning to nature among gods and deers,"Nara Park is highly instagrammed for its closeness to wildlife...really it’s known as Deer Park since everywhere you look are deer! I was excited when we got there and immediately bought a small pack of cookies to feed them. Perhaps it is wise to think out where and when to open the cracker pack because THEY KNOW! Immediately they started to follow and at first it was funny, but some of the deer can be aggressive and one nipped my bum 😑 so just note, these deer are wildlife so do be careful. It is cool how some of the deer are “polite” and know to bow to you to ask for a cracker. It’s quite a cool trick! Also note, with so many deer = a lot of deer poo. I was there on a rainy day...so you can imagine how crazy it could be dodging parts of the ground...Overall, I’m glad I got the insta pic, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for it if I were to do it again!"
55,D’ highlight of Osaka-Kyoto-Nara Family Trip,"The deer park is very big if you consider the surrounding temples. You can find the deers everywhere. It is easy to have a snapshot with the deers. Very often, they would sit or stand still.Generally they are calm. You can make them bow for their cookie."
56,"Cranky deer, gross toilets, big park","Managed to cover all the 3 shrines and the deers in Nara within 2 hours upon arriving in Nara.  In Japan, everything is well organized and nearby.  A day trip is sufficient for those wanting to see the deer"
57,Amazing deer!!! Amazing park,"This park is amazing place to come and enjoy.From the moment you get closer to the park, deer 🦌 will come close to you.Bow to the deer and they will bow back to you....They are waiting for you to feed them with some deer cookies that you can purchase at the park.Beautiful Shrines are located at the park as well."
58,Cuteness overload!,It was a lovely get away from the busy city. Do take note which train you are using to visit this place. 1 train station is Nara station (15 mins walk) and the closes station to the Nara park is called Kintetsu Nara (5 mins) There are plenty of deer around the park. Be careful with your deer biscuit - don’t show the whole stack biscuit on your hand otherwise their will come in a group to greet you. Some deer will bite if you don’t give them biscuit. Please be careful and watch after your small children. It’s best to have a sign - to find where is the rubbish bin to dispose all this biscuit wrapper. Even the toilet nearby the temple don’t have a rubbish bin.
59,Bowing deer,"We toured the World Heritage Nara Park with Yoshi, a walking tour guide. It was a small group and we all met Yoshi at the Nara train station to begin our walk. We took a bus to the far end of the park and walked our way back over the next 3 hours. Yoshi was an excellent guide and had us feeding deer and touring the Kasuga Shrine, the Todai-Ji Temple and the Kafukuji Temple. She also explained the history of the site, customs and gave us an understanding of how Buddhism and Shinto religion relate to each other in Japan The cost was 3000 yen and included admission to the Todai-Ji Temple and food for the deer. We didn't have to pay until we met Yoshi. Worth every penny"
60,Get close (but not too close) to friendly deer!,"From the JR Nara station, it's about a 30 min walk to the park.  As you enter through the park gate, you begin to see deer all around.  There are biscuit vendors throughout the park selling a pack for 150Y.  It is advised not to feed the deer any other types of outside foods (like sweets or salty snacks). You will encounter some deer who are very mellow; the aggressive ones will bite the biscuits from your hands, nudge you or nip at your shirt for more.  A fun & cool experience."
61,Nara Deer Park (day trip from Kyoto by public transport),"This park is a MUST DO in Nara.  It's filled with gardens, shrines, temples and woods.  And of course, you must experience the bowing deer! They are literally EVERYWHERE.  We really enjoyed spending a day here."
62,Plenty of friendly deers,"This is a very large park area with deer everywhere. Gardens and Temples make for nice walks although the large Todajii temple area is busy. There are deer everywhere but beware they can be aggressive going after food. You can buy small packs of crackers for 150yen but as soon as you start to open a pack the deer are after them and many Japanese  while keen to feed them, found the deer were scary and just dropped pieces. Women especially fearful and the deer will nibble at your clothes and body trying to find food. If they even think you have food they will be aggressive so be warned.Overall a good visit but be careful"
63,Shrine and Deer Park,"You have to make sure you go early, we took the 8am train out of Nippombashi, so that you beat the tour buses. Once it gets crowded, it really isn’t much fun. In the morning, you can walk around and enjoy the park and the temples. We were pretty fortunate to visit while there was fall foliage and it was beautiful. The deer would follow you around, and some are actually a little more persuasive than others, but otherwise they were gentle and minded their own business for the most part. Deer crackers were ¥150 for a stack of about 8 pieces.  It’s a short train ride from Osaka so spending a morning here is a great idea! The food and souvenirs are expensive though, so maybe bring a packed lunch or wait til you get back to Osaka."
64,Loved Nara and the deer are delightful,"This place is amazing!  Not only does it have beautiful historical temples for the adults to see, but all the deers also kept my 2 young kids entertained.  They had great fun feeding those deers.  Be careful of the males, they get aggressive.  This is not to be missed when you are in this area."
65,Enjoy A Variety of Trees and Deers,"Overall Nara was great for a day trip out of Osaka to get away from the hustle and bustle of the shopping and nightlife. However, we were unsure how to feel at Nara park with all the tourists feeding the deer these cookies you can buy. Hopefully these cookies are designed for the deer and good for their stomachs because they are fed them pretty much constantly. The deer were very cute and friendly and seemed very accustomed to the crowds of people, but I did feel badly that we were all up in their business. It was almost like an open concept zoo but with only deer..The park is quite huge so hopefully the deer can escape into the less touristy parts.Overall this was a nice place for a day trip, even with all the tourists the park was very nice and there are lots of places to get food and things to see, like the museum and nearby shrines. However, I think it would be better if tourists couldn’t feed the deer and could only observe them."
66,Relaxing place,It is a beautiful park as long as you stay away from the most popular areas and you visit before or after the crowds. There are actually some good sports for autumn colours.
67,Lots of things to see besides deer,"The Nara park is definitely worth a full a day trip. The park is unbelievably vast and beautiful with friendly, brave deer walking around the place. Take your time walking around and photographing everything, but remember to respect the boundaries, and take a while to just breathe and enjoy the view of this sanctuary.The temples, the stairs, the shrines and the monuments are breathtaking. Whether you love architecture, history, animals or nature, this place brings it all together.It's a little difficult to find a place to eat here, although there are many, but they're scarreted around and if you ream free, you could end up just not running into any of them. I would not be afraid of getting completely lost, though, for there are always people around to ask for help."
68,Beautiful park,"Amazing literally get off the bus front the station, about 15minutes and straight away you can see Deer crossing the road lying in the grass next to the road. Such a wonderful sight. We found a place a five minute walk from where we got off that sold deer cookies for 150yen then just go find some deer and soon you will have a flock trying to get the food from you."
69,Amazing temple and surrounds.,"One does not need to worry about a deer encounter when visiting Nara Park, there are literally hundreds of them wandering around.Most of them are primarily interesting in extracting deer biscuits from guests, packets of which can be purchased for 200 Yen a time. The deer bow whenApproaching visitors to hope to persuade them to give them a biscuit.It is very endearing although it can be slightly tense when multiple deer surround you and you are running out of biscuits!There are warning signs about the usual dangers of wild animals but the deer were encountered were very friendly.The park is dotted with various shrines, temples and ponds and a few hours can easily be passed exploring. A unique and awesome experience."
70,Serene and relaxing time with the Deer,"Make your way to Nara and enjoy some local ""wildlife"". You can buy special deer crackers and feed the relatively tame beasts if you dare. I was out of crackers and one of the deer started to bite my pockets and then proceeded to take a nibble of my leg! It did not hurt but I was unprepared for this brazen attack! It was funny seeing Chinese tourists run away from multiple deer as they clutched lots of crackers. We even saw a 2 year old get head butted, but the little guy didn't cry or make a sound. He was totally fine so then it was funny. It is a surreal experience to interact with these normally reclusive and skittish animals. They do bow their heads (some more then others) to get crackers from time to time which is pretty cool. It is a nice place to visit and you can walk around some temples close by if you would like as well."
71,"Serene, relaxing & peaceful park",Nara park is absolutely worth a visit. Beautiful park with many things to see. I did not feed the deer but they are evrywhere so you'll be able to get close for sure. Thw international forum has a beautiful and free Japanese style garden tp stroll around. The walk up to the Kasuga Taisha shrine is beautiful even if you decide not to pay the entrance fee (I woild recommend you do). It's a park so lots of places for a picnic and enjoying the sunshine. Not to be missed if you're in the Kansai area.
72,Deer?  More remarkable than i expected,"Accessible by buses from the train station.Never wear brand new or expensive shoes to this park as stepping on the deers' poops are inevitable (they are everywhere, so are the deers).The deers are already used to humans feeding them with the deer senbei (wafers) that you can purchased around the park. They will bow to you, in return you are to offer them with the wafers. They may become slightly if they are not presented with food, and nibble on your bag or clothes, so do make known to them if you do not have food available (show them your open & empty palms).Other than that, they are really nice to hang out with.I must also highlight, please refrain from feeding any other types of food (and definitely not non-edible stuff, because I have witnessed it there!) except the wafers made just for them. Let's help keep the nature & animals alive for our future visits."
73,Huge and good,"Nara Park is quite a surprise. You don't have to even set foot inside the park to see deer streaming out. It's quite a sight. There are many vendors selling special deer biscuits for 150 yen. I think it's that price everywhere around the park. The deer in the park are actually quite friendly. They willingly pose for pictures and even bow to you when you feed them. As you continue to walk around the city, the deer that don't get fed as much and are hungry, might bite you. So, you should watch out for that."
74,BOWING DEER & History & Temples,The main attraction of Nara are the deer roaming the park grounds freely instead of caged or in an enclosure. People can feed the deer with biscuits and take pictures up close. The novelty wears off quite easily though and you notice the negative aspects such as deer poop lying on the ground practically everywhere you step. Hordes of tourists in busses create congestion on the not so wide avenues of Nara. Nara is an easy day trip from Kyoto or Osaka so it is still worth a short visit to experience close encounters of the deer kind.
75,For kids,"We visited Nara park and stayed there overnight, in a very comfortable inn, with wifi but no tv, wich was wonderful. The park is splendid, with its many temples and shrines scattered all around. The deers are everywhere, some of them more interactive, expecting to be fed with the proper food you can conveniently buy in the park. Others just pass or lie there, only to be admired, never in fear of humans. It is beatiful to watch. Your children will learn quickly how to distribute food among those that may come to you. Ideal if you respect nature and animals and if you like long walks in beautiful surroundings. Men and nature managed to create in  Nara an absolutly unique place."
76,Beautiful park in autumn,"It's a beautiful place, green grasses, polite vendors and the deer are everywhere.  The deer biscuits are ony150 yen per pack.  You can buy them to feed the deer, but be careful when feeding as they will pull and bite the bags.    My children enjoyed feeding and patting them, and in return, the deer bow as a gesture of appreciation.  It is also worth paying for the ticket to visit the temple and shrine.  There is only a small shopping alley, but the souvenir shops are everywhere.  It is truly a unique experience which must not be missed.."
77,Beautiful,"Vast and sprawling it's hard to review an attraction as diverse as this. As a park it is lovely with well tended lawns and forest and the deer that roam through it are wiite something. They are tame as you like from a lifetime of being treated with food by tourists! They are a sacred animal here and have free run of the place.Among the many highlights that you cannot miss are Kofuku Ji Temple Complex with its 5 storied pagoda, the serene Kasuga Shrine and the awesome Todai Ji and Giant Buddha Statue.Honestly you can just enjoy a day spend wander g the place with  beautiful buildings revealing themselves to you as you go.An amazing, wonderful place."
78,Bow to the deers,"This is a huge and lovely park, with a great museum and several separate UNESCO sites worth a visit.  It's also home to the quasi-tame sacred deer; the deer run the place, and most of the cit near the park, and can get pretty feisty when they think you've got food, to the point of chewing on backpacks and climbing on people holding the ""deer crackers"" many vendors sell.  Keep in mind it's their park and act accordingl."
79,Nice deer,If you come to Nara you have to come here.  The park is huge and definitely walk around in addition to feeding the deer.  The deer are not afraid to come right up to you to get a biscuit and some maybe a little more mean than others.  If you have small children this is something to be aware of.
80,#1 thing to do is feed the deers...,A must see when you visit Nara.Be enthralled by the deers and the Buddha templeBest visited during cherry blossom season
81,"Beautiful park, lovely deer and amazing temples","The park itself is a very unique place to walk through, with all the statues and lanterns all about.  It would be quite amazing to re-visit when they are all lit (I'm told twice a year).  It's very much a park feel, though greatly covered with trees along the stone paths and multiple small buildings / shrines scattered all about.  Do watch out for the deer, particularly if they think you've got food in your hand.  They have no problem trying to eat your clothes/books or engaging in a brief chase if you try to get away (hint: they move faster than you)."
82,Deer,"We had the 7-day JR Pass and took the Yamatoji Line from Tennoji Station to Nara Station. It was a fair distance to Nara Park, so we opted for the Nara city Loop Bus, 1-day pass, which was a good decision, for 500y.  You'll need to wait at Bus stop No.2.  Walk out of Nara Station building and seek the locals' advice on where Bus stop No.2 is located.  They'd be most willing to guide you.  There was a long queue, but it moved fast.  The bus dropped us at Nara Park, which was so convenient.We saw lots of deers roaming around.  A few approached us leisurely.  One, in particular, came up to us and began to sniff at our bags and pushed his nose against our bodies!  One of my sisters was squealing in fright.We didn't buy any crackers to feed them because we had the earlier experience at Miyajima Island, where they more you feed them, the more aggressive they become.There were many people around, taking pics, and patting the deers.  They seemed very tame here.It was drizzling, the ground was wet and we had to use umbrellas.  After taking some satisfactory pictures, we decided to take the city loop bus to see the rest of Nara city, while the younger ones in our group continued on to visit Todaiji Temple."
83,Awesome Experience ,"If you really feel lonely in Nara and want to do some socializing, the deer of the Nara Park would welcome you among their midst. Beautiful park that engulfs within its premises shrines, temples, gardens, and deer. If it is  a short stay in Nara, do spend a full day at the park."
84,Our very favorite spot from out trip to Osaka,"The main highlight coming here is the deers! It was a pleasant walk starting from the train station towards the park with freely roaming deers. They are quite cute to watch - some of them even waited for traffic lights with the crowds before crossing the road!We were very careful with the deers and did not feed them with the biscuits sold all over the park (150yen per 10 pcs) - they will come very near you once they detect that you may have food. Sometimes they get abit more aggressive and would surround those people holding biscuits in their hands. Best not to tease them (holding biscuits and not feeding them while taking too long to take photo). As we were walking in the park, it was nice to observe how the animals move around. However I once saw an unattended kid being kicked by a deer who was disturbed. So I believe parents should have been more responsible in taking care of their own children."
85,"Not very special, except deer. ","This beautiful park nestled amongst magical temples on a shady hillside is full of sacred deer , around 1200 of them. They are wild and roam around freely . It is possible to have a truly magical experience when interacting with them if you know what to do and what to avoid. The sacred temple deer have been trained to bow to people when people bow to them . It is truly a sight to behold . It is a considered a crime in Nara to feed the  deer anything other than the deer biscuits on sale from vendors in the park . When you buy these biscuits the deer will come up to you and if they are in a group may surround you and try to get you to feed them . It is not a good idea to try to feed a group of deer as they jostle for attention and can bump you or even bite. It is not a good idea to be backed into a corner by a group of deer . The best way to feed them is to buy the biscuits , put them away quickly into your bag (Preferably on your back)  and walk away briskly from the group of deer . Find a single deer standing on its own  away from the stalls . Then bow to it. It will bow back and then you hold out your hand and feed it a biscuit . They take them from you very gently when they are on their own . Like humans deer have their own personalities and some are really gentle and some more forceful. I met some incredibly gentle deer who were so polite and bowed and let me gently stroke them once I had fed them . I let them come toward my hand to be stroked I didn’t try to pet them uninvited . I loved the experience it was truly magical and if you follow what I have described I hope you too will have a wonderful day with the deer."
86,Up close and personal,"Large park, vile toilets, cranky deer. We rode a bus from the train station to the park, which was easy and short. A large grassy park with oodles of adorable deer. The novelty wears off when the deer start gouging their horns into your children, or biting at your clothes and skin. Apparently not all of the deer care for the ‘hand signals’. The toilets are the worst. I’m not a precious person, and I’m pretty tolerant of all kinds of smells but - wow. Bring as much hand sanitiser as you can carry. We managed to go on a hot day, the museum was closed, and one of our kids got sick. We walked back to the station without seeing anything else."
87,The Best Park in Nara,Unlike other park..this park is a home of hundreds of deer. You can feed the deer by buying a biscuit which cost you 200 yen..however don't be afraid..since you hold the biscuit a lot of deer will coming to get the biscuit instantly..the park is clean..if you continue to explore the park you will find the todaiiji shrine which you will find a buddha statue. Nice place to visit..
88,Exciting for children but exercise caution.,Nara park is home to 1200 wild deer who are also quite friendly.The kids loved it!You can feed the deer but they can get too friendly!Entertaining to watch though!
89,Worth seeing,"Cute deers and they interact with tourists. You can treat them biscuits that can be bought inside the park for 180 yen. Just walk deep inside the park, more deers you can find."
90,Sika Deer Delight,"Delightful clean park with plenty of deer roaming around to feed, it's just ashame about some the tourists letting their children run riot scaring the animals."
91,Devine Visit,Easy and short walk from the train station. Unbelievable to see deer everywhere.  Fun to walk around and get a few pictures. Our kids loved it. You can purchase deer cookies there for about ¥150. We chose not to because the deer are feed quite a bit. Also those who choose to feed the deer be careful as we saw people get charged by deer if they didn’t give the food right away. For those with small children keep them close.  We did see a younger child tease a deer with food then run- needless to say the deer gave the kid a good head butt and knocked the kid over ;) We are very glad we visited. Beautiful area!
92,Home of Sika Deer : the Messengers of the Gods,Visited recently to take in the Golden Buddha and the deer around the temple and park.  Beautiful place and the temple was awesome.  The deer are friendly (particularly if you have food) but very entertaining in there own way.  A great way to spend a few hours.
93,Great for the children,The park is very nice and designed to host a lot of tourists. The deer are friendly and welcoming especially when you feed them with specific deer crackers. The signs can be improved.
94,Nara Park Tour,Large parklands full of deer and people. All the other attractions are nearby. There is seating scattered around the park. Entry is free. There are hundreds of deer and are not afraid of people. U can purchase special buscuits to fee them.Great for the young children
95,Good place to de-stress,"Strolling around this park and feeding crackers for deer is the reason coming to Nara. Deers are walking in the park freely and they are not shy to ask for foods.We had fun here, they are not so wild as I thought. I was with my young kid. I was so nervous when I saw my daughter beat the deer because it tried to eat my paper tag of the stroller. But the deer did not get mad, it may know that my daughter is very  young kid and it did not bite her or kick her. The deer is very humanize.There is a temple after passing through the deer park. It's just like all other Japanese temple. I went inside and made a wish then we heard back for lunch.It was a very special and pleasant day trip.I highly recommend you to come here.Tip: Nara Park is a five minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station  but  20 minute walk from JR Nara Station. Tip: Hide your crackers as deer may steal them.Tip: Go early as it's a popular spot, deers maybe full if you come here in late afternoon"
96,"So many deer, so few biscuits ","To me, the park is just for kids. basically is like a zoo with free roaming deers. but it is on the way to the famous todaiji temple though"
97,Amazing,"This is a must when visiting Nara. The deer are friendly and you can buy food which they take gently.  I would recommend taking hand wipes or hand gel to use once you have finished as the only hand washing facilities are in public toilets which although are readily available, only water."
98,WonDEERful park! 🦌,This park is a gem. Lots of things to see and if you move away from the crowds you will find lovely gardens and places to explore. We went to a garden that was free for overseas visitors and it was quiet and peaceful. It was the highlight of the day. The deer were lovely but there is so much more to see at Nara park.
99,Sweet deer 🦌,"Pretty park, fall trees, deer everywhere, temples. Lovely way to spend a morning. If you feed the deer you're looking to get swarmed."
100,"An Incredible up-close visit with ""wild"" deer",A lovely big park that is roamed not only by humans but a large group of deers who are completely oblivious of the humans. They are very tame and would bow their heads to you in exchange for biscuits that are sold by vendors along the trails.Good for a slow walk with lots of places to rest and for the kids to run. Restrooms are easily available and shelters are strategically located should the occasional showers come.Great place to spend a half day and also take the opportunity to visit the Todaiji Temple which is within walking distance from the park
101,Super cool,"We walked several miles with small deer, many children, Japanese and tourists. There are water features, trees, bushes and easy access to several temples."
102,WOW !!!,Nara park is nice for a day visit. I recommend staying in Osaka and spending the day or even just an afternoon in Nara. There is lots of history but the main attraction is the deer freely walking around the park. You can buy nuts or crackers from vendors and feed the deer. They are very polite and bow their heads for food.
103,So many deers!,"Absolutely amazing, this place is breathless! Full of amazing shrines and there are deers everywhere. The park is clean and well kept."
104,Deer are friendly or some are a bit agressive,"It’s a beautiful and peaceful park. You can see deers everywhere to walk with you and ask your food. Don’t feed them too rush and too many, just little by little and avoid attracting too many deers around you, otherwise you may feel scared. I like to sit on the grassland to enjoy the calm atmosphere. Luckily we can see some red maples even it’s early November."
105,Hungry Deer,Visited the famous Nara deers. Docile and only interested in humans with deer snack. Snacks are sold at fixed price by vendors at various points in the park.
106,Fun with deers,"A half-day trip is more than enough to enjoy the whole area. Once you get out of the train station, take right and start walking. Enjoy the scenery all the way long. No need to take the bus, it's nearby."
107,"Yes, the deer do bow","Nara Park, of course, meets all the criteria a park as such requires. It's green and there are plenty of deer hanging about begging for deer cookies while beeing photographed by tourists. Still it wasn't a spectacular parks as such or as parks go (particularly in Japan). For me it felt more like the road needed to be taken in order to reach the desired temples. So it's nice - yes, but nothing special to my eyes."
108,Must-do place - feed the deer!,"A short walk out from the train station, the deer are walking around, sitting under the trees, etc.  There is a small stand where 2 elderly women are selling crackers in bunches - to feed the deer.  Be careful!  The deer will walk over to you, a little too aggressive for me! I dropped half my crackers trying to get away from them.  They tug at your clothing, push you... it's a little scary.  I pushed my daughter out of the way and tried to feed them as quickly as possible, thank goodness she wasn't holding the crackers!We walked along the path to the temple, and found other stands selling crackers, and there are less deer assembled, so feeding them is much more enjoyable.  My daughter chose to feed the smaller deer, and they were so adorable!  Some of them bowed every time she gave them a cracker!!!  I got such good photos and videos, she LOVED IT!"
109,Nara Park,As there are a kit of crowd everywhere. The park is nice place to relax. Easy to go around. At the end just a park with deers but wlrht sitting around for a moment.
110,Walk with deers and enjoy beautiful ponds with maples,Autumn has arrived but still a lovely place to walk around and be greeted by the deer.200 yen buys you biscuits to feed the deer. If you bow to them they bow to you!  They are gentle but still wild animals - so not to play with.  You must visit the Tokondo Hall and Kohfukuji national treasure hall and the Todadiji temple as a bear minimum.
111,Must-do ,"Totally worth the trip to Nara Park. The deers were roaming freely and no cages or barriers were seen in this park - we sensed ""freedom"" :) We were there at evening time and witnessed the beautiful sunset on the background with many deers early getting fed by the visitors - such beautiful setting !  We will visit again if we are back in Japan."
112,Fun to feed the deer,"Absolutely amazing time at the Nara park, the deer are well mannered and do appreciate the rice crackers that are sold all around the park. Rice crackers are very cheap so well worth buying a few packs to gain a large following of deer around you :)"
113,Good stuff and not so good stuff,"We visited this park because we were going to Todaiji temple and I just fell in love with the deers. They sell cookies so you can feed them, they are not shy to ask for food and some of them even bowed for it. I will give this half a day."
114,Must visit ,"Last time I was in Japan was in the summertime and the fallow deers (daim in French) had bright white spots (deers don't have the spots). This time, in January, we could barely see the spots. From nice gentle creatures, they are now emboldened by tourists giving them food. If not fast enough, they will try to steal your bag, whether it contains food or not. They are in many parks on the main route to the big Bouddha."
115,Nice quick day trip to Nara,"Nara park is full of small deers who mingle weith the tourists in the anticiaption of being fed with deer crackers being sold there at a cost of 150 Yen. The deer are very sweet but should be trated with some respect and can get a bit ""pushy "" if they think you have some crackers in your hand. Some of them have learnt to bow to get a cracker! Tie this in with visits to Todaiji Temple, Kasuga-taisha Shinto Shrine, Kōfuku-ji or the lovely Isuien gardens. Plenty to do and see in Nara to keep you occupied!"
116,Beautiful!,"- amongst all the places we went to our recent trip in Japan, the encounter with 🦌 deer’s were the best and we truly enjoyed- train from osaka was only 40mins & convenient journey - accessibility to temples were also extraordinary"
117,Beautiful park and deer,"Nara Park isn’t difficult to miss. Whenever one mentions Nara, one thinks of deer. Legend has it that the deer are offspring of a sacred white deer from Kashima Shrine and are messengers of the gods. There are signs throughout the Park advising that the deer are to be fed special biscuits that can be purchased by any vendors located throughout the park. The deer are friendly and seeing a couple of deers who were ‘bowing’ for a biscuit. They are scattered throughout the park and will even allow you to pet them. It’s a 10 minute walk from Nara Station.deer. There are lots of deer to be found. Legend has it that the deer are offspring of a sacred white deer from Kashima Shrine and are messengers of the gods.

The deer are friendly and saw a couple of deers who were ‘bowing’ for a biscuit. They are scattered throughout the park and will even allow you to pet them."
118,Good for an hour or so,"We were a group of four friends from Serbia visiting Japan for the first time. We have heard about Nara, its nature and dears, but honestly, we were not well informed about its historical and cultural importance. However, we were quite lucky to meet Mrs Reiko Imayoshi at the JR train station in Nara and to have her as our guide. In Todai-ji temple Reiko-san gave us very useful information about the architecture of the Buddhist temples, the sculptures/representations of Budha and the history of this particular temple, while in Kasuga shrine we were introduced to the basic concepts of the ancient Japanese religion, enjoyed the nature and even were encouraged to feed the dears, which we did for the first time in our life.  We are so grateful to Reiko-san for planning carefully our limited time in Nara and for showing us the most important monuments as well as the most impressive segments of the Nara Park thus making the most of our short visit to this wonderful place. Furthermore she gave a great insight into the Japanese contemporary lifestyle and values and she was a wonderful and friendly companion.The route with Reiko-san included the bus transfer from the train station to the Nara Park as well as the tickets for the park and the Todai-ji temple for the quite reasonable price.Reiko-san, arigato gozaimashita!Maja, Nevena, Miki and Gordana"
119,Ups and downs,"A huge park with a lot of shade and very interesting nature. A good place to escape the blazing heat. Unlike many other parks in Japan, it has a lot of vending machines and trash cans. Also a currency exchange machine (near the museum) and various shops.Basically most attractions you will want to see in Nara are within this park.Of course a huge and cute attraction are the hundreds of deers living in the park. They are totally friendly and absolutely free. They come very very close to humans and you can feed them special crackers that you can buy for 150 Yen a pack.Now this should be common sense but I will still write it: These deers are wild animals. While they are very used to humans and friendly, they can bite, buck, stomp etc. so be careful, mindful of your children and pay attention to your trash, bags and food you might carry."
120,Lots of deers,We had a great day at Nara Park the deer are very tame but can be quite demanding when food is on offer. Very relaxing walks through the grounds and beautiful gardens.
121,"Hordes of people, some great gardens and shrines but plan carefully","Nice park, very clean and full of deers. There are people on the streets that sells the deers crackers, I think they know and from time to time they are a little aggressive if you don't give them the cracker."
122,Nice for a short visit out of Osaka,"Awesomely fun place for young and old. By the time we reached Nara, we had seen many deer. Nara's deer has a history of more than 1000 years. They are known as the Oracles, loved and protected. Nara's mascots are deer. There are about 1,200 wild deer in Nara Park. They are very friendly to tourists and other sightseers."
123,A highlight of Japan,Beautiful park populated with hundreds of deers. Be careful feeding them. Park is huge- plan 2-3 hours for visit.
124,lovely walk with deer and people,"This was our second visit to Nara.  We discovered that deer around the great Buddha temple are more passive.  On this trip our three year old daughter was just standing on a sidewalk when she was attacked by a deer.  He charged and knocked her down and then later charged my wife.  There are signs clearly stating that these are wild animals and can attack and those signs are true.  Fortunately, there is at least one area where the deer are far more calm and passive. If you have small children you really must be very alert if you are strolling through the park.  Viewing the great Buddha is a must. Very impressive.  We arrived too late to view the museum so no comments about that. Also, take the bus or walk from the train station.  Taxi fares are super expensive (for the relatively short drive)."
125,Charming,This was such a lovely surprise to walk to around this beautiful park full of friendly deer and to walk towards the Todaji temple.
126,Not worth it,"Really easy to get here for a day trip from Kyoto. A lot of walking involved, but well worth it to get to see the giant Buddha in that beautiful temple. Other temples and a gorgeous little garden on the way, plus of course, the almost tame deer."
127,"The park, the temples & everything in Nara!","A lovely park with loads of friendly deer roaming around looking for deer biscuits.  Vendors sell biscuits that is approved for feeding deer ¥200.  Do keep belongings safe/guarded and please act responsibly - a tourist dropped his tourist map and was quickly picked up by a deer.  My partner and I had to gently wrestle it out of its mouth, but not before it devoured some of it!  Tip:  you can catch the JR line to JR Nara and don’t be put off by guise books saying it’s a bit of a hike.  And don’t bother with the bus either.  The walk from JR NARA station isn’t that far and quite a pleasant street to walk up.Tip #2:  keep a look out for where you step - there is deer poop everywhere!  :) (Especially of you have small kids)"
128,Romantic park shared with deers,"The scenic, calm and serene view of the park is fantastic. Abundance of wild deers around, however, be caution to ensure that you are not playfully gored by one of you intentionally do not want to feed it. Deer crackers are sold n you can buy it to feed the deters which is a good experience. Love the calmness, nice breeze and beautiful setting. Shrines and  temples including surrounding areas are well kept. Love it here."
129,Tranquil,"This was our first venture out of our AirBnB, we used our Kansai Thru Pass (great deal, it includes almost all public transit except JP rail) to get there which was about 1.5hr rail ride.  There is a market just outside of the train station (sorry I forgot the name) that has nara themed gifts and food.  The park where the deer are is just a short walk up the street on the right.  There will be a few carts/vendors selling these waffle crackers for the deer, about 200 jpy for a stack ***hide the stack from sight ASAP.  My advice with the deer:- go to an area with one or two deer- keep one waffle in one hand and the stack in the other- offer up a waffle, but bow when you do it - they will bow back, give them the waffle- the waffles are big so you can break them up easily to make them last longer- IF YOU ARE BEING SWARMED BY DEER - hide the waffles and show them BOTH of your empty hands, they will go away- watch behind you, some of them like to bump you for attentionOk, if you keep walking inland after the deer there are signs for the temples, you can walk around most of them but if you want to go inside the two big ones then you can buy a double entry ticket for a discounted price.  After the temples and down the hill there is a wonderful little pond with a scenic view, a good place to rest and eat some food if you bought anything from the street leading away from the pond (I got a fresh red bean hot mochi just a short walk away - yum!)"
130,Day trip from Kyoto,"Note that the park is nearer to (Kintetsu-Nara line) as compared to (JR Nara Line). Although you can still walk there from JR Nara Line (Takes abot 10 - 12 minutes). For first timers, do note that holding onto the biscuits in plain view will make you a lighthouse for the deers. You will be swarmed!! (Watching people getting chased around was funny). Try to bring a small plastic bag to keep the biscuits in if you intend to buy a few stacks. Also, the deers are known to sometimes chew on your shirt/shorts. So if you intend to wear your better outfit, do be careful!"
131,Beautiful fun walk in the park,"Must do for animal lovers! Deers roam freely through the park, spread over 500acres. Very friendly, though not overly interested if you don’t buy the biscuits. Packs of biscuits can be purchased around the park for 150yen (approx $1.70 AUD)"
132,Walk in the park,"The Nara Park is filled with deer, hundreds of them, and I did enjoy seeing them. However, with that being said, the experience at times seemed a little intimidating to me. Of course these animals are still wild, and were aggressive multiple times towards people during my visit. I enjoyed seeing them and since I am in Japan, it was an experience I had to be a part of. Though if you’re not planning on enjoying other sights in Nara I would think twice about going. If you are brave and have no problem going up to feed and pet a wild animal, then go for it! But the experience was cute nonetheless... who doesn’t love seeing deer?!"
133,Fun outing,It’s very interesting to see so many deers in a park which they are not afraid of people and after food around you!
134,Second time in Japan and still a must see,"walking through this park is wonderful and the very first impression, being welcomed by sweet (and hungry) deers is absolutely awesome!"
135,Nara park,"The park is famous for the deer that roam around freely, you can feed them by buying the crackers food from the side vendor that sells them. But prepare to be surrounded by a lot of them once you start feeding them, they can bow their head every time  they ask for food :) just like Japanese people bow for respect."
136,Highlight of our trip,Nice place for relax and watching deers and feed them with rice crackers which you can buy on every corner. So you can relax and rest before you will continue to enjoying beauty of Nara. Please just really don't feed the deers with anything else or you can harm this beautiful creature and don't forget to take you plastic garbare or you can again harm them.
137,What an experience ,"Moving East and out of the Kofukuji temple complex, via the middle path, you cross over into Nara Park proper.   And deer, and tourists.   Lots of Both!    Now, it's not exactly clear if this section was Nara Park or if the whole parklands area is known as Nara Park.   Check a map here for yourselves, you will probably want to work out which direction and shrines you want to see.   On the way in, you'll pass vendors selling ""Deer Buscuits"".   These are the proper approved feed for the deer and it's reccomended that you only feed these to the deer.    So grab some cookies and get some deer attention.   Let's be honest, that's one of the reasons you're here, right?    Us too!    There are deer all over the place and most are docile however some can become aggresive in the pursuit of food.    Keep you buscuits close to yourself and be aware of deer sneaking up behind you.   Due to the Japanese custom of bowing, a number of the deer have learnt to associate bowing with food and will bow to you as they think this is what they do to get food.    A word of warning here:  Recently, a number of deer have been found dead with a kilogram or more of plastic bags in their stomach as the deer had been eating them, thinking they are food, because they smell of food and food is produced from them.   Please keep you food bags and rubbish with you until you can safely dispose of them away from the deer.    Sooner or later, you will decide to leave the deer and move further along the park.    Nara Park is host to the Nara National Museum, which is in the Nth East quarter of the park and is split over two buildings.   We chose not to visit as the shrines were the target of the day, and that's about the only other attraction in the park.Overall, the park is a busy place with many self-guided and tour groups wandering around, feeding the deer and feeding themselves.    Not a bad place for a bit of people watching and seeing what the deer do to other visitors!    Toilets are located around the park as are drink vending machines and a couple of shops.  There are shady trees paved paths through the park and the gradients aren't too steep so it's good for elderly or disabled visitors.   To or from the shrines, you'll visit at least part of this park and if you're there for the deer, then this is deer central!We then moved out of the park via the Nth West corner.   From here you can go north to the Todai-Ji temple or East to another complex of multiple temples.   We went East.Watch out for our next part of the temple trek and hopefully we've worded you up on Nara Park.   So throw us a helpful vote to let us know we're doing it right.And Have Fun!"
138,Not Impressive,"Since we were staying in Kyoto and going to Osaka afterwards, we decided to stop by Nara for a few hours since it was ""on the way"".  We suggest taking the express train instead of the regular train since it makes fewer stops and will get there quicker.  We left our luggage in the lockers at Nara Station (very convenient) and took a taxi to Nara Park (since it was faster than taking the bus and comparable fare since there was four of us).  The park itself is quick huge so we decided to walk over to Todaiji Temple since we didn't have too much time in Nara.  There were many deer all over the park and seeing them was okay for us, as we've seen deer and other wildlife in the wild before.  It was interesting seeing them interacting with the public though.  I would've given the park itself three stars but gave it an extra star with the temples, shrines, and other spots of interested located within it's boundaries."
139,Nice time with the Deers,"As the title said, you can see the deer everywhere. And get the deer food at the stall which located around everywhere. It’s only 150yen for one packet. The deer know how to nod their head to beg for the food. Make sure you take a good video with that."
140,Oh Deer!,"Initially I was worried to see how these animals are treated but they are 100% free to roam around Nara park and the surrounding areas- they even cross the roads and climb up stairs just to have a look at what is going on. You can buy deer biscuits for 200JPY which the deer love. Do NOT feed them your own food. They BOW before taking the biscuit out of your hand. The ones who want to be left alone are having little snoozes in the sun and don’t approach you. It was very nice to escape the concrete jungle of Osaka and be in lovely fresh air with friendly, happy animals. TIP: Nara is small (but beautiful) and I would recommend day-tripping from Osaka and wouldn’t stay in Nara just for this activity."
141,Deers and temples,Nara is a must visit on your itinerary but keep in mind that you move near  or through Nara Park to see most sights. The travel brochures that show a few isolated deer wandering around miss the fact that there are absolutely 1000’s of deer and they get close and personal as people love feeding them. Unlike Myajama  where there are smaller numbers of deer and you are continually advised not to feed them. To be honest I am no deer expert but there are way too many. As at 2017 official numbers were put at 1700 with 164 people injured by them in 2017-18 alone. Trust me this 1700 is under reported - double that and you might be close.
142,Filled with deers and nature,it was really a good experience for my family specially my kids to have a close encounter with the deers at the Nara park. We fed the deer and they were very tame. you can buy and feed the deer with the deer senbei at 150jpy You can touch them and have photo with them without any fear of aggression. the park also have lots of temples and shrine. The best was the Buddha shrine which we entered. There was this hole in the pole that kids ( and adults maybe) should try to pass and crawl through which believed will give enlightenment to the next life. There were lots of food stalls and a big variety of food to choose from. Must try are the okonomiyaki and the skewers. the park is also very near the train station. Lots of souvenir shops and modern stores around the station. half a day is enough but if you wish to relax a full day will also work. you can have a picnic or stay at the benches all around. a starbucks coffe shop is also just around the corner. Please visit and enjoy the experience. Highly recommended!!!
143,"Oh dear, my deer 🦌!","Just a short walk from the train station. The deers roam free in and about the park, even on the road. They are pretty friendly but be aware not to agitate them. Walk through the park to get to other attractions."
144,Worth a visit,"Extremely beautiful park, lots of deer, people walk between them and tourits may also feed them offering special snacks."
145,Deer Visit,"You might come to Nara to see the Todaiji temple and it's well worth it. You start by entering Nara Park and you can't miss the deer.They are incredibly tame and will bow their heads for you in anticipation of getting a piece of a deer biscuit that you can purchase onsite. I know you think they might bite but they just want the food. However, they will nibble at your pockets or purse or anywhere you might have stored the biscuits. Nara Deer are hungry, and this is not their first rodeo. They’ve seen tourists like you come and go all day. The deer want you to get to the important part of your tour. Please feed me!In most cases, the deer will bow their head and indicate they wouldn’t mind a bit of cake. The problem comes from the herd mentality and when there is cake, more deer will join you. I had deer nipping at my jacket and my pants pockets. I had to show my open palms when I was done with deer biscuits so the deer could look for other sources of food!"
146,Stop feeding the deer,"Beautiful scenery and wonderful experience with the deer in the park. The deer also go down into the streets and interact with humans. it is a very special and wonderful experience. But please remember, if it rains, the deer do not come out of the forest into town.Will keep coming back here!"
147,It’s all about deer. ,"It was indeed a tremendous, joyful and memorable experience being with the Sika or Japanese deers at one of the oldest parks in the world established in 1880 with more than a 1000 Sika Deers at Nara Park. Locate in Nara, Japan it is a large 660 hectares park traversing the main city with small lakes and surrounded by UNESCO World heritage sites attraction including the Todaiji Temple and several shrines. Sika deers are considered holy here as a symbol of one of the Gods in Kasuga shrine. It is illegal to harm them but you are allowed to feed them by buying special designated Deer crackers (Shika Senbei) on the stores around the park. It is around 150 yen. Be mindful when feeding them especially if your surrounded by large groups of herds because they may overwhelm you and at the same time they do bite, especially the young ones. There are several novelty stores, food and restaurants nearby as well. If you wanna experience traditional Japanese rickshaw there are also rickshaw available for service. There are several openings in the park but we took the one near Todai-ji temple (will have separate review).  The park is for the public and free. So from JR Nara Station we boarded bus from the East gate which is easily identifiable. The ride is about 8 M but you could also walk for about 40 mins. We took shot beautiful photos and videos together with the lovely deers and got to experience feeding them. So spots are peaceful, some are very chaotic (with many deers). You could also touch them but be very careful for the bite. Overall it was indeed a lovely experience with them I will surely be back here at Nara Park when I visit Kansai, Japan."
148,Unique deer park,"The undisputed best part of the city! You can spend days strolling around this park if you so choose, and if you need crackers for deer there are various stalls that sell them all over. There are few places in the world where you can have quite as unique an experience as here. There are also other attractions inside the park, such as the Nara National Museum and Todaiji Temple. Just remember to be gentle and kind with the deer, they are still wild animals and they can bite or headbutt you pretty hard."
149,Deer and World Heritage sites all in one stop!,"The park and surrounding area is lovely. The deers are very friendly so if you are scared of animals this place may not be for you . Only buy the deer wafers if you want to feed them, break them in half to make them last longer. Bow to the 🦌 it will bow back to you."
150,Love this park,"I came here in January 2020 with my girlfriend, and Nara was on our list just for the Deer, we didn't go anywhere else(although we probably should have). you can feed the Deer crackers that you can buy from vendors that cost about 200 yen a pack. Be careful though, they can disappear really quick! my advice is to break them in pieces so that you get more. There were a lot of tourists when we went. but there were plenty of deer just hanging around so you can easily get a deer to yourself... or 10. i would recommend this place to anyone staying close by!"
151,Bowing Deers!,"Nara is identical to the deer which is the icon of the of Nara.More than a thousand deers in this park freely  even interact with visitors by feeding deer.Should not give any food to the deer, must be deer food biscuit that sold in the Nara Park area.Because lately some deer have been found dead due to plastic rubbish found in their stomachs.Prepare food and give it to deer.  Don't tease or hold food when you want to give it because the deer will act aggressively and will even bite.If there is no food enough just wave to them.Access to Nara Park from Osaka using  JR Yamatoji Rapid Line, Osaka Loop line or the Kintetsu Nara line.From Kyoto take JR Nara Line or Kintetsu Kyoto Line.The nearest access to Nara Park is from Kintetsu Nara Station."
152,Wild/Tame Deers,"I had seen this place on TV, so really wanted to visit. lots to see, lakes, woods and of course the Deer, so beautiful and very freindly, cost 200 yen for crackers but worth it. tip, they can eat the wrapping in they come in, I found out when a deer, stuck it's nose my pocket and had a nibble! I spent over 2000 yen feeding the deer, they are not aggressive, but they will come up to you if they see food! very tame and beauiful, will be back there again, my next trip."
153,Park of deers,"Second time here,deers are so amazing animals.Tourist have to remember to keep the area CLEAN.Deers will get sick eating rubbish or plastic left behind from inconsiderate people"
154,Amazing ,"Even if the park itself is beautiful it was awful to see all these tourists treating the deers in an inappropriate way. You can buy these rice waffles for 150¥ for the deers but people/tourists let them eat plastic bags and paper, and even feed them with plastic directly! It‘s a disaster. I won‘t come again and I hope you as well wont support this by going there. On our way back we picked some stuff up (as visible in the picture) and think about this: all this trash will land in the stomach of these animals, even when you throw it on the ground - they will eat it!"
155,Wow,"If you are visiting Osaka, make sure you put Nara on your itinerary. It’s very easy to get to, take a JR train will get you to Nara station, from there a short ride on bus will reach Nara park.Quite a big park that roam with heaps of deer and you would find vendor selling snack or cracker to feed the deer, careful when u feeding them as often u would draw a lots of them to you and next thing u know is some of them bid you, and sometimes they got aggressive as well. You will need to make the hand signals of “ no more “ and they would stop harassing you. Nara park is very beautiful all year long, you could just sit on the bench and admire the beauty of the nature once you get bored with the deer.Walk further a bit and you would find the massive, beautiful, ancient To-Dai Ji. There were quite a numbers of restaurant, souvenirs shops around as well to make sure you would be re-energized after the long walk or something to bring home for memories."
156,One Deer In Too Many,"It's simply amazing how Japan can make modernization, technology, wildlife, and nature live in harmony together.The experience of being close to wild deers is just one of those simple joys and priceless experiences.Being mugged by deers just to get that deer cracker is fun, exciting and scary at the same time.You should not miss this experience! This is definitely a must!"
157,Unforgettable morning in Nara with Reiko-san,"If you have kids and you're in Kyoto or Osaka, you should come here.   Feeding the deers was the highlight of our trip for the kids (and adults).  Our kids loved it so much, they asked if they could go back again. The deers nip me a couple of times, some are pretty aggressive."
158,Deers and lots of tourists,"Whilst staying in Kyoto for the weekend this July i decided to take the family to the Nara Deer Park. The park is easily reached by train from Kyoto Station, we caught the JR Nara line which meant we could use our Japan Rail Pass, so no extra train tickets costs involved.The Deer park is a short taxi or bus journey from Nara station,and there are drop off and pick up points located outside the station and by the park, which is located at the top of the hill. So if you visit on a hot day this is the most convenient way to travel rather than walking. We visited on a Sunday in July, where the temperatures reached close to 30 degrees.You are able to purchase Deer food in the form of dry biscuits from stall holders and the biscuits cost 150yen. The deer are free roaming and you can hand feed the deer, which is a wonderful experience for all ages. Even my teenage children enjoyed feeding the deer.The park has restrooms and water fountains for your use. There are covered picnic spots too.If you should be in the Kyoto / Nara area then i would definately recommend a trip to see the deer. You can also combine the visit with some culture, as there are shrines to visiti within the area."
159,Bambi-deers world,Large park to walk around with deers meandering and walking around freely. Very calming and beautiful place.
160,Wall to Wall Deer,"After 1000 torii gates then 1000 monkey photos, this was our 1000 deer experience. We walked pretty much aimlessly around ending up at the top of Mt Wakakusa. So peaceful and so beautiful. The deer are mostly friendly especially when you have deer crackers (200 yen per pack) although one did try nibble my trousers and another had a go at wiping it's nose on my coat but all in good fun. No damage done."
161,Lovely walk through ,"Park Nara boasts one of the densest concentrations of UNESCO world heritage sites in the world. There are the main sites of Nara here: Todaiji temple, Kofuku-JI temple and Kasuga Shrine. However, not that remains in the memory, and a huge number of deer, of which there are more than a thousand. They are not afraid of people and begging, which doesn`t cause no condemnation the majority of visitors . Crackers for feeding cost 150 yen. The only time deer are unsafe is during the rut - mating season. At this time males knock trees about trees, and they're dangerous to humans.They do this not because of aggressiveness or the desire to attract a female, but because hormones are produced in the horns that are responsible for puberty and the activity of the sex glands in adult life. They want to get rid of excess load quickly . The blood circulation in the horns ends at the end of the mating period and the deer rubs its horns to shed the skin. Park workers cut off the antlers with a saw. This necessary work is carried out in the autumn and furnished as a ritual. Workers dressed in traditional clothing, and horns have been portrayed God, as donations sanctuary. Tourism demands a spectacle..."
162,Lots of deers,"Nara. Boy, oh boy! It’s such an interesting place to visit. And if you’ve ever seen pictures of people feeding deer up close and personal while in Japan, well this is exactly where it’s done. T"
163,Great Day,"If you've come to see the wild deer in Nara Park who supposedly bow when offer food, you might expect to see a few contained animals. What you actually see are hundreds of deer. And they are not contained in the park. They walk all over the streets and in the shrine area. Buy the treats that are sold and spend an hour feeding these animals for a surprising time."
164,Nice stroll with deers,"When I knew we would be flying back to Japan this year I knew we had to go back to Nara Park. For relatively little spending money you can have an amazing day of fun.We picnic lunch from 7/11 and went to CoCo Ichibanya for dinner afterwards. I think the whole day cost us about 5000 Yen including both meals.It's easy to get to and walking distance *(follow the crowds) from the train station.If you think you've bought enough biscuits for the deer, you're wrong. Buy more, the deer will thank you."
165,Very cool park,"This park gave me a first deep impression is deers. The deers are cute and their eyes are stunning when they look at crackers. I afraid of them a little bit because I saw many people were been chased up by the deers. And they who were been chased up are taken the crackers. So I didn't buy crackers, but my friends are bought. However, the deers have not chased up my friends. They were harmless and tame. Maybe I have the wrong idea for them. I had an amazing moment with the deers. I had fun here, so I recommend it here for everyone."
166,First time with deers,"Unusual and surprising place to go where you can find thousand of deers begging for cookies (you better dont play with them), Great Buddha statue, shrines, amazing architecture and beautiful park. It's really easy to go there from Kyoto or Osaka (less than hour by train)."
167,Feed Deer Experience,Had a wonderful time feeding the deer crackers and enjoying the beautiful shrines. The deer are very friendly. The deer also look healthy and appreciated.
168,So nice!,"As a resident of the NE US, the idea of spending time in a city where deer rule made us leery given the fact that deer are associated with Lyme Disease above all things. But: we enjoyed feeding the ravenous deer, loved watching them bow after being fed, and enjoyed the city, temples and shrines."
169,Must go if you love deers,"We visited Nara whilst staying in Kyoto to see the deer. They were so tame and placid eating the deer biscuits out of your hand. We found the ones at the south park of the park near the shrines and museum very tame in comparison to the ones in the north open part of the park- they were very pushy! I would definitely recommend this as part of your stay, particularly if you want to do something a little different"
170,A lovely deer park ,"We hired bicycles near the station and rode through the park which helped cover bigger distances in the short time available. we weren't always sure where we could ride and where we had to leave the bikes though. Lots to see including impressive structures, thousands of deer and forest. Deer get a bit excited and pushy - especially the males in mating season! Be careful to avoid the poop everywhere too. Worth a visit though."
171,Tourists are killing deer (unintentionally),"The park itself is only so, so. There are lots of deer roaming around freely which is fun for Kids. If you have more time to spend than you know how to fill up, then Nara can offer a laid back 'day off' from the busy city. You can safely skip Nara otherwise."
172,The Lovely Sika Deers at Nara Deer Park,"My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, with Optional Excursion to Nara Park.If you are in a hurry, most likely you can see everything within 2-3 hours.  As with most attractions in Japan, very well organized (and of course, extremely clean!). We enjoyed seeing the deer and could interface with them with a bit of food.  As with the Miyalima Island, you have to be careful not to let them get too aggressive, and keep paper out of their reach, else it might be chewed!!"
173,Beautiful park with deers,Great park with lots of friendly deer. Maybe don't feed the deer the 150yen crackers. They seem to get more aggressive when being fed and they will run after you. Some great shops with Japanese knifes also on the premises. The walk through the forest towards the other temples is also nice and relaxing.
174,Where else can you feed deers,"We went to Nara park in July. It was hot and cloudy. Deer poo everywhere but fairly easy to avoid because it wasn’t raining. 10 deer cookies are 150 yen and I bought 4. There deer are friendly, just don’t annoy them or make sudden movements. Also the deer are hungry and more aggressive in the morning. We went went by about 1pm many were sitting under trees and not really chasing you for cookies."
175,Nara Park - Temple Trek Part 2.,"We bought crackers three times. Once along the main path towards the temple with the buddha. The deer there were aggressive. You had to run away as soon as they handed you the crackers. Don’t be afraid. Parents with small children, same the little ones the trauma of possible aggressive deer and feed them yourselves or risk crying children. Some deer do bow. Once you walk a bit further in the park, we saw more friendly deer. We loved this. And we’ll come back everytime we’re in the country."
176,Beautiful park and cute deers,"The park is spectacular and sets the scene for long leisurely walk watching the deer serenely walking about.  There was the occasional territorial scuffle that added to the realism.  Take a picnic, find a quiet spot and absorb the atmosphere. A great day trip taking the park and the Temple.  There are museums if you want added information."
177,The BEST part of Nara!,"There's a lot of cute deers! Nuff' said right?You just need 2-3 hours looking around the area, play with the deers, go to the Big Buddha temple just 10 mins walk away. It was a very simple place to visit, you don't need to rush for anything and it makes it so relaxing to visit.Just visit this place if you plan to travel between Osaka / Kyoto"
178,ONE DAY WITH THE DEER,A fun place to walk around. The deer are an added bonus. For a price you get these wafers that you feed the deer and they will come feed from your hands. Keep in mind that these are still wild animals and treat them with respect. We noticed a few people tease them with the wafers -- they got a bitten for their efforts!
179,Beautiful park with lots of deer,"We are headed back to Japan in September. This will be our 5th trip. We stay in Kobe when we are there but one of the absolute musts is a trip to Nara Park. It is a huge  place with a number of great attractions. Primarily the park is filled with little deer that are allowed to run loose in a natural environment. They are looking for treats. The park has biscuits for sale that they love. Its really fun for kids but we love it too. After walking through the park your payoff is an immense Buddhist temple with a very large Buddha surrounded by some other statuary as well. If you are within a couple of ours from Nara Park, don't miss it."
180,Very unique place where people and deer spend time together,"There are many deer here and they are rather calm until there is food. However, when you bow to the deer, some of the deer will bow back which is very cute. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery while strolling in the park. Love the environment."
181,Worth visiting,Beautiful park with the deers. Get up close and personal and spend time with the deers. The park is massive and the deers are confined. They are freely roaming around the park and tourist can feed them with the crackers that are being sold in the park for a very small amount. The park is close to Nara JR line by foot in about 15 minutes walk.
182,Getting up close with the deers,"This location looked so charming! It is not.1. I petted a deer, and got deer mites on my hands. Mites are not dangerous but I wasn't sure what they were, and wound up going to an Urgent Care in Honolulu and dermatologist (just to make sure the first doc was correct). I hadn't petted a deer since I was 10, and yielded to temptation - don't touch the deer!2. The deer are aggressive. I had no food on me, and no explicit scent, and a deer came up from behind and pushed me with its head. Deer weigh a lot and I was startled - and frightened.My husband bought the crackers and fed the deer. They gathered around him rapidly, which can feel overwhelming. However, what WAS overwhelming was that one  deer took ahold of his pants below the knee. Fortunately, it let go, but that was not a pleasant experience.I would never take a child near these deer. We saw kids teasing the deer with food - do the parents realize the risks?There appeared to be no town officials providing advice or anything else.If you want to go to Nara - they do have some lovely museums, stay away from the deer. They are NOT Bambi."
183,Cute . . . for a only a short while,Incredible and magic place! The deers are very charming and so sweet. As long as you treat them well they’ll do the same! Definitely recommend feeding them with the crackers that are sold on site.
184,Superb,"Fantastic shrine, fun time interacting with deer. Some smart deer will stalk u to get food from you. Just got be careful and not provoke these deers. Otherwise they are quite gentle and peaceful."
185,Meet friendly deer,"Worth the trip to Nara, even if just for a day or overnight, to see the scale of deer and their quirky little personalities. You can buy biscuits to feed the deer for 150Y and some of them become a little more impatient that you feed them at this point! They’re not afraid to nip at your clothes! There are loads of deer in the main part of the park but actually they are also all over the park and near the shrines too. There’s a huge hill up the back of the park where they hang out too."
186,lots of deer,"Deers were very cute and gentle.  Weather was good, Nice place for a walk. You can buy deer feed for 150yen yo feed the deers. You can also walk through the park to the todaiji temple."
187,Kids loved it,"It was a fun place for friends, families and couples. Note that you will need to buy biscuits to feed the deers (do not feed them with outside food). The deers are so smart, they learnt to bow their heads to beg for food, they are so very cute!"
188,Lovely Park and allows up close with Deer,"We took a day trip from Kyoto to Nara. We loved feeding the deer, but you need to be careful around them. They can be a bit aggressive trying to get at the biscuits. You just have to not be scared and you will be fine.  We also enjoyed the beautiful Temple and park grounds. After visiting the temple and deer, we walked to town and did some shopping. It is a nice town and there is plenty to see and do while spending the day there."
189,So many deer :),"What a fun experience this was, most fun seeing people buy biscuits & be chased/harassed by the deer (in a friendly way)! I Got a great giggle & a great selfie! The park itself is beautiful and as expected it was packed with tourists. We visited the todai ju temple, insuien gardens and we also attended a tea ceremony. You could spend a day or two in Nara it’s such a big area with plenty to do at a nice steady pace!"
190,Bowing Deer of Nara,Well planned tour and it was a full day including lunch. Deer park should be great for kids and there were so many hungry and greedy deer. Really enjoyed it
191,Magical experience,What a great morning. The deer are everywhere! All very friendly and eager for a deer cracker. 150 yen for a pack which was reasonable. Beautiful surroundings.
192,A full immersion in a fantastic landscape,The Todaiji temple was excellent - the guardian statues and the giant Buddha were magnificent.  The feeding of deer was horrific to watch ... children and adults alike teasing deer with wafers just to get a selfie.  The male deer had their antlers cut off just so tourists do not get rammed. The Kasuga shrine with its moss laden lanterns was great to see but once again the deer feeding and touching detracted from the experience.
193,Sacred Deer are really lovely,"The main feature of the park is a heavy population of deer that have learned to beg for food and when approached right, will bow for food. However, they also leave their droppings everywhere and can charge tourists, grab items you did not intend to give them, etc. Overall, a tourist promotion and definitely not the highlight of a visit to Nara."
194,Worth a visit ,"Deers are everywhere, from the streets to temples and grass landscapes.  Droppings  are also everywhere, but the locals are sweeping it up when they see it. Dont get too concern with stepping on them. Apparently i went during the mating season; where they may be more aggressive than what you have read in reviews, but everything seems normal... they are still aggressive. Somehow those bigger deers with antlers are more docile than the younger and female ones. You feed one, then u have another 5 butting you, nipping on your legs and waist. I almost have to run at times.Just raise up your turning hands to mimic that you do not have biscuits or food, it works! Overall it is an experience!"
195,A truly unique experience.,First time saw this place with many deer’s and they are friendly . If you want to feed them you can buy some crackers for them . Nearby restaurant was serving eel bento and ramen o try one ramen noodles here. I came here with the bus from train station consider here is convenient please remember to throw away all those plastic containers bag because deer may eat all the plastic here.  We shall cut down using thousands of plastics to save our environment now.
196,Better to be a deer in Nara (Japan) than anywhere in Africa,"Loved my time here, although I was here at the hottest time of day.  The deer are amazing and I can only imagine what the place looks like at 5pm. The stroll through is lovely with lots of temples to see.  I really enjoyed being able to escape the heat at the refreshment area which provided a cool space to sit, free tea and water and also an earthquake feeling experience.  I met the most interesting and informative visitors guide there who shared the history of Nara with me and his enthusiasm was infectious.  I really completely enjoyed this as a day trip away from Kyoto and now have an interest in exploring this area more."
197,One of the most amazing experiences you can have in Japan,Beautiful park with friendly cute deers as companions. Can relax enjoying the view while feeding the deers. Love it here
198,Feed them!,"The park itself is gorgeous and definitely worth the visit. You can spend a whole day here without getting bored if it wasn’t for the hordes of tourists. There are just too many people making the place crowded and loud. They should initiate some type of a reservation system to limit the amount of people because it definitely deters from the atmosphere. One of the main attractions here of course are the deer. They are everywhere and are not afraid of people. You can purchase deer crackers and feed them but be careful as they can get very pushy when they see the food. On the other hand, through, when you feed them a cracker you would receive a very polite bow - even the deer are well mannered in Japan :-)))"
199,Great experience,"Just try to travel between spring and autumn, in winter, i guess, colour of deer become darker (not attractive for photos :D )"
200,Great free attraction! ,We were expecting to see just a few and were so wrapped the who town was full of them. Kids loved it!
201,Cute deers 🦌,"The park has museums as well, but the deer seem to be the big draw. Suggestion: Try to go on a cooler day, and have comfortable walking shoes - it's a big place! Watch your clothing, maps, and purse, as the deer seem omnivorous!"
202,Walk through the park of deer,"The park is a pretty nice place to stroll around and feed some bowing deer. We were expecting a small herd and smaller deer. But there are a ton of deer here and they are pretty big. Tame and calm too. And they love the biscuits. If you let them bow then give them a bit of biscuit they'll keep doing it until you run out. Biscuits are for sale by venders all over. Easy to find and about ¥150 for several. Running and screaming from the deer is not the best plan. The deer can get pushy if you tease them. They will kick and head butt. Just ignore them and put your hands away when you don't want to feed them. They will wonder away then. Its a pretty unique experience. My kids will definitely remember this. We got there early and missed a large portion of the crowds. There is several parking lots around, all were paid and the price varied depending on location."
203,"You can stroke and feed the deer, free to get in, watch out for poop! great day out for all",With the lake reflections and autumn leaves it was very impressive. This one doesn't involve too much walking.
204,Overrated. Nothing but deers,"Nice to be in an open space, you can stretch your legs here. The deer are not big and quite tame, perhaps a little too expectant of being fed. Temples and shrines give the place extra interest and the visitor a route to follow."
205,"Aggressive deers, alright place ","It pains me to report that the Nara deer of today are in bad shape and mean, unlike the ones of yesteryear's.Back then, they had beautiful & clean fur and were much more friendly.  Today, they are dirty and greedy!  One stepped on my toes in a rush to fight for food, and oh boy, did it hurt!  A couple of them bit and pulled on the back of my husband's t-shirt to get his attention while he was feeding the others.  When my niece was holding the deer crackers she was swarmed in seconds and got very scared.  She ran and was chased after, so she threw the crackers in the air and ended up crying in fright.Many of them now have severe cases of scabies, too.  Such a sad sight.I was also very disturbed to have seen the deer being teased for food by some school boys.  I tried to tell them not to do that, but they didn't understand English.I think the poor deer in the Park deserve to be looked after better.  They are Japan's national treasure, after all.  There should also be security guards or some form of authoritative staff who look out for deer teasers and stop them because apparently some people don't read signs or don't bother to care.I was looking forward to spending time feeding the deer as it had been years since i last visited Nara but ended up very sad and disappointed.  The poor, poor things ... T_T"
206,Nara park ,A wonderful experience walking together with these beautiful animals that fearlessly approach and caress each other. Visit to the park of Nara It is a unique experience for both body and soul. If you can stay in Nara a whole day is a truly magical place
207,A lovely Sunday experience,It is fascinating to see so many deers in the park.  They will swarm you when you have the deer biscuits.  They pull your bag and shirt. The deer biscuits costs 200 yen.  It is worth trying.
208,Cool!,"The walk from the train station to the park was longish but not too difficult. The deer were lining the walking path looking for biscuits even before we reached the park.  They were very cute and gentle, except haha,... they took little nips of people's butts! You should hear the squeals from all corners when they did. It was a very unexpected, fun half-day outing!"
209,Oh Deer! ,"I went to Nara park this afternoon, walked around and fed the deers which were fun but my highlight was riding on the rickshaw. It was my first time so i was nervous but the experience was amazing. My driver spoke really well English and explained everything nicely and easy to understand. I learned a lot about Nara.and the deers .It was well spent money and great experience. He also stopped by many places for me to take pictures. Also took pictures for me which was great because i am a solo traveler and really didn't get a chance to have picture."
210,Novelty deer experience,"These deer are very gentle and used to interact with people, you can feed them but playing is not recommendable."
211,Vacation ,"In early April, when there are cherry blossoms everywhere, the weather is great, there are wild (but friendly) deer all around you and eating deer crackers from your hand, some lovely gardens with waterfalls- there is no better place than Nara. In my view it is best covered individually or with family"
212,Deers are very dear to me,It’s worth going here just to watch the tourists screaming and fleeing from the deer who get a little excited when the food comes out. You need to be careful as they can nip and leave a mark. Watch out for your bags and belongings as they will be into everything looking for a biscuit or two. We had lots of belly laughs watching screaming girls.
213,Plastic eating deers and rude tourists,In the park there are an abundance of deer. They are very tame and they follow you arround looking for food. It is said that if you feed them they will bow to you. I watched as many of them were fed by others but I did not see any of them bow. They are not to be fed with everyday food.  You can feed then with the crackers that can be bought from the vendors arround the park.
214,Fun feeding the deer,"Very nice park with lot of deers to touch and take picture with them. Be careful when feeding the deers. Many will surround you if you feeding them. They will bite your clothes, bags to gain your attention. There also a few shrine to visit. Overall a very nice place to take a stroll."
215,"Quaint, Romantic, Olde Worlde","As for foliage in the park and temples they pale by comparison to those at Tofuku-ji in Kyoto for example.  Nevertheless do enjoy them during the short period when they are in bloom Nov/Dec.For 200¥ here get yourself a pack of biscuits and you will guarantee yourself some good time.The gentle deers will crowd over you, nudge you and even chase you for their delicious treats.  Don't be afraid, they don't bite.Oh and watch out for all those tiny pellets all over the ground.  Your can easily miss them.  They are excrements from them after munching on tourists biscuits all day."
216,A Absolute Must,"Beware while feeding the deer. They bite, push, and surround the person. The temple is good slight to see."
217,One of the highlights of our Japan trip,"Guess is common knowledge there are hundreds of deers walking around so I’ll try to give some tips regarding other stuff. Morning time they are hungry, so be ready to have them coming after you if you have a cookie. Don’t stop and buy cookie at the first place after the station.. there will be an infinity of deers further ahead that will be less excited about the cookie. One actually bit me because I was holding a cookie. Didn’t hurt but better if I could have avoided. Be careful about dropping plastic, a few deers died already because they ate plastic. I could clearly see the difference when going back in the afternoon after they were all fed. They were just calmly laying there chilling and was much easier to pet and take a pic."
218,Once in a lifetime deer experience ,"Went on a weekday afternoon. A pretty decent walk from the train station. Fun to feed the deer, they were quite tame in the evening.  Maybe they were full from all the other tourists feeding them throughout the day."
219,Fantastic Place,Get close to deers and touch them. The male deer’s are aggressive and will bite you slightly for biscuits. Their horns have been sawed off. It’s not as dangerous. There are vendors at the entrances selling biscuits. Cash only. There’s a lake for a short walk and restaurants to try.
220,"Cool to see, but a little overrated ","We went to Japan to play on the summer vacation last year. The weather in Japan is very cool and comfortable. There are many deer walking around in Nara Park. You can feed them rice crackers,people who like to interact with animals must love this place.And there are many cute deer souvenirs, you can buy it and take it home to share with friends and family."
221,Lot of deer,"Very pleasant to walk around the park with deers roaming freely. They were tame, cute and so adorable. They could smell one had food and they really bowed !!  It's true they really knew how to bow for food. Very interesting. It was very relaxing day."
222,Good experience,"You can see the deers almost as soon as you steal out of the train station. They don’t only stay inside the park, but they also cross the streets and wonder around the city. The park itself is very beautiful, with different temples and things to see. If you decide to buy the cookies for the deer, make sure to hide them, otherwise they might crowd you or attack you (nothing dangerous really, maybe bite your jacket). Make sure to bow before you feed them and show them your empty hands so they understand they cookie is gone. This is fun actually."
223,Quick visit,"This was the second visit to Nara Park for my husband and I. This time we visited in a group pf 9 family members and it was so lovely to see everyone feeding and interacting with the beautiful deer.It's wonderful that visitors are able to purchase deer crackers (which are very cheap) knowing that they are nutritionally good for the deer and not harming them in any way, and that the proceeds of the sale help support the care and protection of the deer.The deer were the main attraction for us, but there are many other sights to see in the park including the amazing Todaiji Temple which is also well worth visiting."
224,Good park,"Beautiful grounds and the deer are great fun.  They can be really pushy so do make sure that your backpack or bag is fully zipped up.  One actually used it's antlers to try to unhook my bag from my shoulder!  If you hold your hands up in the air above you the deer will ""bow"" which all my kids loved. Deer food can be purchased easily and cheaply from multiple stalls but don't overdo it as you may get sick of the deer a bit quicker than you expect.  The Todai-Ji temple is well and truly worth the entry fee (unlike many we came across) and the grounds are beautiful."
225,Some deer are gentle; some are aggressive,"Pictures and travellers' accounts don't lie, you can feed the wild deer which roam the area.  But kindly buy the proper deer food being sold by vendors to make sure the animals remain safe.  The park is about a 5 minute walk from the metro station and there are shrines further down the road."
226,Must visit if you are in Osaka,"The main attraction here is definitely the deers.  When you feed them with crackers, they bow you after that. So sweet.  You can walk around the park and feed the deers as often as you want. Some of them behave better than others.  The park itself is nice, with lovely picture perfect corners.  Enjoy!"
227,Deer Encounter,Very relaxing in the park.  The deer roam around and some of them will even do the bowing motion if you do it in return for deer cookies.great pictures can be taken as they are very timid but can get a little feisty when they see you holding the deer cookies that you buy for around a hundred and fifty yen from the local vendors.they are everywhere so as you go from monument to shrine to Temple you will run into them.
228,Unique Experience,"The park is pleasant enough but the deer seem to have taken over and battle for a place in streets with the many tourists that flock to this place.Nice park but the deer were a nuisance , provided an unpleasant odor and required constant attention as to where you stepped."
229,Deer love biscuits,So this was a visit to allow my 2.5year old to enjoy the company of the deers but the deers nearer to the train station on the way to the park are definitely conditioned to be way more aggressive than they should be. The term gentle deer didn’t go so well with my kid when a deer stuck his head into the pram and pulled out the banana meant for my kid’s lunch. I suppose we could have been better prepared but it did make her slightly upset and less willing to interact with the more gentle deer further into the park. Otherwise it’s a beautiful place to be at. We didn’t get any biscuits to feed them after that as we realized the more they know you actually have food the more aggressive they would be.
230,Must-see In the Kansai Region,"The deer in the park were with so many and very adorableWeather forecast was not great but we were lucky only few drops of rain in our way backWe decided last min to rent bikes. As walking to park from JR station is 20 minThe bikes were only 700 yen. We cycled through the park, and fed biscuits to the deerThere is a shopping street between station and park"
231,"Feed the deer, but be careful!","Firstly do note the deer are wild, they are not in any form of captivity so there is no fear of mistreatment or them being forced to be there.That being said they are looked after well due to their standing in local culture and beliefs so they are taken care of. It is amazing to get so cloase and to see them bowing for the deer biscuits. The area is lovely with loads to walk around and see, can be busy but due to the size you can just walk elsewhere and find a quieter spot.The temples are equally worth the visit as they are really nice and vary between each one. Especially worth seeing the huge Buddha in one of them.A really nice day out overall that creates lasting memories and is very special."
232,What a Surprise!,"This is the place to go if you'd like to spend some time with wild but tame animals, deer in this case. Their numbers were sparse when I went, not the hundreds that many other reviews state. Probably 50 tops, but it didn't detract from the experience still.It's a 10 minute walk or so from Kintetsu-Nara station, you can grab some food at the connected Higashimuki shopping district before heading to the park also. When first reaching the park there were just a few deer. Walking deeper revealed more deer and there's more around Todai-ji Temple.Do buy some senbei (deer cracker) for 150 JPY so you can enjoy a closer interaction with the deer as they come to you for food. I haven't had aggressive deer apart from one which was closer to the road heading towards Yoshikien Garden. Guy walked from behind me and bit my leg through my pants. Hurt but didn't leave a mark and it's okay, it's an animalDo not show all of your food to the deer, and a tip we learned from a musuem or visitor center nearby with information about Nara is make sure the deer sees your hand empty after they eat from you so they know you don't have any more food.As the title states, 30 - 60 minutes is good for this place."
233,Loved it,An entire (Huge!) park of friendly deer and many of these deers bow for their treats. I dismissed this as a typical tourist trap but the deer’s stole my cynicism and it ended being one of the more memorable experiences of my trip to Japan.
234,Worth the visit,"Trust me, there's a dignified way of ""feeding the deer"" in Nara. For the first time, I uploaded a short video on YouTube about ""feeding the deer in Nara RESPECTFULLY"". If you bow to the deer, they will bow back---and expect to be fed cookies. It beats throwing the cookies at the deer as most tourists were doing. It looked incongruous. By the way, it costs 150YEN for 10 deer cookies.In Nara, the locals treasure these ""messenger of the gods"". We were blessed enough to do a 2-day safari in South Africa in 2018 and we learned that the deer is like McDonalds fast food in the African bush. So it truly IS a privilege to get so close to a deer in Nara. Am so grateful to God for this experience:)"
235,Deers and more deers,I strongly recommend to visit this nice park full of domestic deers. You can easily feed them and caress these beautiful animals.Really worth to visit the Buddha temple.
236,beautiful park!,"The day in Nara Park was my favorite day of my Japan trip. Where else in the world can you wander around feeding deer that will bow to you? Nara was very easy to get to from Osaka and was ~40 min to travel to. We didn’t have the JR Pass but you can take the local lines. Once you get there, it’s an easy walk to the Park and there is clear signage. Granted it’s very geared towards the tourists but there were quite a few schoolkids on field trips in the Park as well. You can buy the biscuits from licensed street vendors all around the park and it’s all 150 yen, so no need to try to bargain. The deer would bow but they are also pushy about getting more food if they sense weakness/think you have more food, so don’t be bullied! They might headbutt you or bite but just keep calm and walk away quickly if that does happen. To feed them, hold up the biscuit so that they see it, then bow at a 45 degree angle. Wait for them to bow back and then repeat as needed. Give them the biscuit by holding it at their mouth level, grabbing one end of the biscuit so that your hands don’t accidentally get bitten. Rinse and repeat!The park was extremely pretty too: very green and in close proximity to all the temples. The park itself is free to enter so be respectful and don’t litter. Have fun!!"
237,The awesome deer experience ! ,"We love animals and wanted to see the bowing deer. They were great, BUT ask yourself if you’d be happy with thousands of humans harassing you, over-feeding you and touching you when you are pregnant and trying to rest under the trees. I found it kind of depressing to watch. We ended up spending more time trying to get away from the crowds and had lunch in someone’s home kitchen restaurant which was a real treat. The shrines and temples well onto the park are lovely."
238,Well-controlled deer population - though they seem always hungry!,"Great place to visit, feed the local deer. Trick is to stay calm when feeding them. During some seasons they get less treats so they may be more aggressive (little nibbles, or head butting to tell you they are behind you and want a treat). Also buy from a stand that doesn’t have a ton around, they know what you are about to do so once you buy and turn around yo have a bunch of deer in your face wanting the cracker. Overall they are really friendly and accept crackers gently. Nice open park to walk around."
239,Super deer’s Park ,"Our trip to Japan was at the beginning of November. We decided on this park after reading reviews. We spent a lovely afternoon in the park, up close and personal with the deer. Many around, all keen and eager to approach as you open up the crackers. Crackers must be purchased from the small stores on entry. Lots and lots of people around but still enjoyable. The deer have obviously been taught well by their Japanese masters as we were captivated at how many times they kept bowing their heads to us in appreciation of their food. My daughter and I really enjoyed ourselves, despite the odd push, shove and little nips from certain deer so be careful!"
240,It’s ok but not a must,One of the best part of the trip was the bowing deers. You can walk up to deers and bow to them and they will bow back if you feed them. The deers do get cranky if you run out of food though.
241,Another must in the Kansai Area,We got to Nara around noon. We walked to the park where we enjoyed being around deers and giving them cookies that you can buy there. Afterwards we walked to a couple of temples and we saw the Great Buddha which is stunning. We also purchased tickets for the museum that is nearby.We were staying in Kyoto so around 4 pm we got back. This is a great way to spend a day outside of Kyoto and absolutely recommend it
242,Lovely experience,I am not sure who was pushier - tourists wanting to take pictures of deer eating or the deer wanting to eat. Nara park is one of those places that is exactly as described. A weird mixture of absolute shambles and great curiosity.The temple itself is probably the most worthwhile part of this park but it was super difficult to get to because of the crowds.
243,Deers steal the spot! ,"I could get chilled  and relaxed there, observing and feeding cute deers. I will definitely visit there again."
244,Pretty park with temple and museum,Deers can be quite aggressive when they know you’ve food on hand. Park has deer poo all over. Follow the pathway and it leads you to a huge temple with rich history.
245,Oh my deer,"Had such a great time feeding the beautiful deer!  We bought deer crackers and were amazed when they immediately came toward us and bowed asking for a snack.  Be aware however, once they know you have food, they can get a little aggressive.  I provided a cracker to one, then turned to feed his friend and the first one bit my coat evidently informing me he wasn't yet finished!  It wasn't hard enough to rip my coat or anything, it was more funny than scary.  Just thought I'd mention it in case you're traveling with children.  They're truly beautiful creatures.  Loved it!"
246,Well worth a visit,"Please respect them, and only feed them the ‘authorized’ biscuits. They are really cute if you treat them well and don’t chase them around as we saw children do today 😠"
247,Watch Out for the Deer,"My daughter, who lives in Japan, took me to Nara park on a beautiful fall day-Halloween actually. We were a little early in getting the fall foliage colors but it was still a very relaxing walk. Several temples to check out for a price if you want. The grounds are very well kept. Great fun feeding the sometimes pushy deer. As soon as the bag of food is open they follow you everywhere. When the food is gone you’re of no use to them anymore. Haha. When the colors of the trees start changing I’m sure it’s spectacular!"
248,A wonderful mix of UNESCO world heritage and deer Kingdom.,Was a pleasant walk around the park. Deer are interesting and very friendly. We had a cold Starbucks on the patio. Ross from the park.
249,Nice park,"We paid for a tour that took us to Nara to see the Shrine there, and we got a quick chance to see and feed the famous deers that wandered the place entertaining people who visited the park. We really enjoyed the experience. We have teenage boys and they were entertained by the friendly deers. I bought biscuits to feed them and my son & I got chased by the deers. They pushed us and followed us to get to the biscuits. It was such a funny experience. The boys wanted to go back again the next day, but we ran out of time. The trip from Osaka takes 1 hour 30 mins each way. I highly recommend Nara Deer Park for everyone. You need about 3 hours to see the shrine and deers."
250,Well worth a visit.  Great for kids and adults alike.,"Anybody who likes one of the three things I mentioned on title will obviously have a great day in the park.Not too far from Osaka, you can easily reach Nara in 40 minutes from Namba station to Nara Kintetsu station.The park was full of colourful leaves as I visited the park during autumn. Absolutely beautiful.The deer is my highlight. They are amazing and can interact with human nicely.See more photos on my IG @small_world_for_all"
251,Amazing,Such a nice place to visit... you can walk around with a lot of deers... you can also feed them with some food they sell locally.. But be careful not to have spare food in you pockets because they can easily find them LOL). We enjoyed a lot!!!
252,Huge Park Area but beware the Deer,Fascinating being surrounded by wild deer that remain tame enough to pat. They roam the park freely coercing visitors to feed them....many vendors selling not too cheap bags of biscuits for those willing to part with their money for a great photo feedding the deerr.
253,Deers everywhere! Cute! ,"We really enjoyed our walk through Nara park. The autumn colours had started to show and it was wonderful to stroll among the ponds and deer. Feeding the deer was a pleasure, although there were a few naughty ones who pulled on our clothes."
254,A Trademark of Nara,"Loverly place as we strolled around taking photos and patting the deers. Walked around, sat down and just took in the  serenity. Must to go and visit. Had a great time."
255,At home on the range,"Deers found in every corner of the park! They will not hesitate to look to you for crackers, even to the extent of nudging you or even biting you. At least they would be 'polite' about it by giving the standard Nara deer bow. Which makes it hard to resist giving them the treat. Be careful of the poos everywhere though."
256,A day with the deers,"It's worth a visit to experience the deer roaming freely on the streets. But, as other reviews state, the deer can be a little aggressive. If you want to get away from the crowds, and the aggressive deer, you can climb to the top of the big hill near the park. Less people, less deer and a nice view of Nara. It's a bit of a hike, but it's worth the effort."
257,An experience like no other ,"I was here in November, but just before the proper autumnal colours had arrived...nonetheless it was beautiful!I spent quite a lot of time wandering around the park in the quieter places away from the areas near the main road. I saw plenty of deer as you would expect as Nara is famous for them, but also met loads of local people wanting a chat. Honestly it was a really memorable part of my trip.I got here on the bus from JR Nara, but walked back in about 20 mins."
258,Beautiful place and plenty of wildlife,"We can pet the deers, feed them with deer biscuit and leaves and also take photo with them. Kids love it too(some are afraid though). My 6 year old daughter said it’s the Japan trip highlight after Disneyland. But somehow many deers look unhealthy and thin. It’s also very crowded with tourists there (poor deers) even it’s 2 weeks after golden week, I don’t know if it normal. If you don’t have much time in Kyoto, you better skip it."
259,Oh deer!,"It's frightfully big park full of deers all around, seem they wanting food and a bit troublesome. The garden  is at the entrance of Todaji temple and the deer smell is a bit overpowering...the deers are so tame..."
260,A beautiful experience being so close and personal,"We were told there would be deer ... lots of deer ... at the Nara Park.  But there were more deer than I think I have ever seen in my life!  We were told that they were ""wild"".  But given the amount of interaction they have had with humans, they were very docil ...... unless they thought you had food in your back pocket or hidden in your carry bag.  Then they got a bit aggressive.  Many people who bought ""deer cookies"" to feed them discovered that in addition to attracting lots and lots of deer that some of them must have felt they were being overlooked and nipped at your pockets or hands.There were a lot of people at Nara.  But I think there were even more deer.  Big ones, little ones, deer with antlers, deer following you, deer just sitting patiently everywhere ... even deer sitting under the sign to the Todaiji Temple.You have got to go there.  It was an experience beyond expectations.  Bambi lives!"
261,We came for the deer,Deers roam around the park. Suggest not to get too excited when u see the first few because these are the ones that have been well fed.  Try walking towards Todai-ji Temple and there are many deers there.  They respond better because they are not so well fed. Lots of photo taking opportunities with these wild animals. Worth your time
262,Hoards of deer everywhere,"Really enjoyed visiting Nara Park! My husband and I had such a great time feeding the deer! They're so gentle and sweet. If you love animals, I highly recommend!"
263,Oh deer,"It is unusual to get so close to a wild animal. But years of being hand fed by tourists have made them very docile. They are every where, and so is their poop! So be careful where you tread. Plenty of vendors selling food for the deer. Plenty of photo opportunities."
264,Oh deer,Don't feed the greedy and aggressive deers in the beginning of the park. There are more friendly ones longer into the park.The park in it self is very pretty and many places you can avoid the crowds. Feeding and watching the deer is a big plus.
265,Unusually tame deer. A very odd but nice experience.,"We loved Nara and Nara Park.  Our 13 year old son was enamored with the deer and we loved how they bow for biscuits - amazing.  Very scenic and lots of temples, gardens, and shrines to visit.  We spent almost a full day here with a private guide and had an amazing time despite frequent downpours.  Highly, highly recommended."
266,"Mean, greedy and unhealthy deer",The park is BIG. The deer are friendly. The deer and park are awesome. My kids just love to feed the deer and looking the deer bowed to you when the deer asking for food from you (my kid bowed back to the deer). A place cannot be missed.
267,So cool ,"Love all the deer walking around. Easy to buy crackers to feed them. They can get aggressive if you done give them the crackers, but one of the coolest experience!"
268,Rent bikes,"Being around these amazing deer was a wonderful experience. But I also came away horrified. I was aware that the deer eat plastic which messes up their digestive system, and die as a result. The reality of this issue struck me when I spotted a doe fully invested in an empty plastic container and literally had to wrestle it out of her mouth. I went back in the evening, when there were very few people and most of the deer had retreated into the woods for the night. It was impossible not to notice the plastic water bottles and other trash that had been left behind all over the park. Did people not realize they were killing the deer they had come to see? I did not see any signs in the park explaining that plastic kills deer, so yes, I think people don't even realize what they are doing.Another thing I noticed was that there are very few trash cans in the entire park. If the park could invest in more trash cans, there would very likely be less littering - and thereby less unnecessary and unnatural deaths. What the park needs: 1. Signs to make the public aware of the issue and the consequences of littering. 2. A lot more trash cans (a type that deer won't be able to get into or tip over)."
269,"Extremely fun with lots of deer, and lots of deer poo!","We Enjoyed feeding and petting the deers but, the deer tend to be aggressive and they poke your behind begging for more cookies.We were lucky to see the wisteria in full bloom. ¥500 entrance fee was worth it.The deers were roaming freelt."
270,"Very nice park, with a lot of deer","Kids love trying to feed the deer. They’re so overfed that amongst the dozens of deer at the front of the park, it took half an hour to find deer that would eat all the biscuits we bought. There are plenty of deer inside as well so you can hold onto the biscuits and feed the more hungry ones inside. We saw a man standing in front of 3 deer. He bowed and they bowed back in return for treats. It was very cute! My kids tried it later with some other deer and it worked!"
271,Deer park and wisteria garden,"Walking near, feeding and taking pictures with the deer was amazing. Yes, the deer do bow before you feed them their cookie! The deer cookies can be bought from vendors around the park. It can be busy, but there are lots of deer around!It is important to note to feed them a deer cookie after they have bowed because that is what they have been taught. The bowing is amazing to see, but they also do deserve their reward."
272,"Lovely park, fiesty sacred deer","Always wary of attractions with animals but needn't have been here. The deer are truly free to wander around as they please, and there are plenty of fenced off areas they can go for some quiet time away from all the people. There is also plenty of fresh water on offer for them to drink in the summer heat, so I was very impressed. You can buy some deer cookies at various points in the park, and as soon as you get them the deer start to creep up to you. They aren't overly aggressive or anything but do come up very close so smaller children might risk getting knocked over. I loved the experience though of seeing these beautiful animals up close. I'm very happy to see that they are well looked after and they aren't forced to interact with people of they done want to, which is why I'm not a huge fan of the various animal cafes."
273,Lots of gentle deers walking around,"This park is famous for its deer. I heard they have been around for hundreds of years. They learned to bow for the food, which is very interesting!"
274,Spring!,"I know its surprising but you dont have to buy the biscuits, the deers will come to you regardless and let you pat them. If you have biscuits they will go crazy because they love the biscuits and do anything to eat all of the ones you have, so dont buy them! we didnt we spent 3 hours here and pat so many deers, and ones sitting near us and just laying in the sun.We saw so many moronic tourists get jumped on/rammed because they were teasing the deers.The poor deers are so food motivated but they cant help themselves and they become agressive, so remove the problem - biscuits - and then you're safe! easy fix."
275,The amazingly friendly & beautiful deer of Nara,"The deer are quite tame and comfortable around people... but are aggressive with food. Be sure to keep your hands visible to show them you don't have any food, or they'll pester you and pull at your cloths/bags."
276,Deer,"Lots to see here - the lakes, the forested areas, the deer and, in the autumn, the wonderful colours of the trees. We lost ourselves because one of the deer ate our map and only later did we see the warnings about it being the mating season when the deer can be a little agressive."
277,Head for the hills!,We had heard about the deer that roamed the town of Nara so we had to see for ourselves. This was by far my favorite part of the place. It was just so much fun to see and interact with the deer. You can by a stack of crackers to feed them. Some are a little aggressive but they mean no harm. Soo fun. I highly recommend.
278,A good day trip from Kyoto,"There are lots of deer here. They are cute, friendly, and are fun to feed. You can buy cookies to feed the deer (vendors all around sell them). If you want to feel like a superhero, feed the deer early in the day (but watch out they may want to eat all your cookies). Later in the afternoon the deer fill up from all the tourists feeding them.Oh yes, there’s also a park here that’s fun to walk around in, but that’s not the main attraction."
279,Hilarious. ,"We couldn't decide whether to visit the deer park while in Japan, but we decided to get up early and go! It was worth it in the end, but highly recommend getting there early because by 10-11am the place is flooded with tourists and the deer don't seem as happy. We arrived by 8.30am and they were on the streets, wandering up to us and happy for a pet, but by the time we left, they were moving away from the growing amount of tourists around"
280,Hungry Deers,"I admit at first glance it’s nice being so close to the animals, that are walking around freely, and to take pictures and videos. However, this aw-effect starts to wear off very quickly and you start to see the negative aspects.1) the fur of the deer does look unhealthy. This for sure is a consequence of a lot of fights amongst the deer for food. Another reason might be the crackers or other stuff given to them. Some even denied to eat the leafs and grass handed to them, which should be the natural thing for them to eat. Additionally the prefer to wander around in on the plains of the park near humans instead of higher up in the woods (couldn’t see a single animal in the woods).2) unlike the parks in big cities (e.g. Paris, London or New York) it’s hard to find a poop-free spot to rest and enjoy the moment. Of course you cannot expect to find a spot which the animals have not marked as they are amongst humans.3) towards lunch time the park gets very crowded. A bus full of tourists follows another. We were happy to arrive early enough to enjoy a few hours of calm.4) of course when facing an enormous amount of ppl, it’s hard to take pretty pictures without too many strangers in your frame. Even worse with the increasing amount of ppl in one place, the potential/share of mindless tourists increases too. On several occasions so called cellphone-photographers walked into my frame when I was taking closeups. At one time I got so annoyed I angrily asked them to clear my perspective.In consequence, do not trust the marketing material you find online or around in Japan. It’s definitely not that calm and good look taking pictures without massive crowds in your background (unless you arrive there super early or they close the park for your shooting), and the animals can be very aggressive. Morally it’s up to you whether you think deer should be accustomed (or even dependent) to humans."
281,Fantastic day trip,"I brought my brothers here during New Year's Eve and the park was packed full of people. The entire area was filled with festival stands selling amazing street food like grilled octopus, Kobe beef steak on a skewer, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, etc. There were tons of deer relaxing in the main thoroughfares, but most of them seemed a bit overfed as they were completely uninterested in the deer crackers that I bought. The ones further out in the less populated areas were more receptive in eating them. We never encountered any of the more aggressive deers though. All of them appeared completely used to being petted constantly. One of my co-workers suggests trying to feed them blueberries, but I never had the opportunity to verify if they like to eat them or not. All in all, it's a great day trip from Osaka."
282,Great to visit between Kyoto and Osaka.,"Then the deer become more of a nuisance than an attraction. And they are smart enough to see when one buys the ""deer crackers"" from the on-site vendors, so they follow those with treats in hand."
283,Deer stole my banana,"As soon as you get off the bus you’ll want to buy biscuits and feed the deer. Don’t.Get walking up hill and it gets quieter about 20 minutes in. Go all the way up and we found some younger, less aggressive deer who were more than happy to wait for the biscuits.The views from the top are incredible as is the walks around the shrines and temples."
284,A very enjoyable visit,"Be very careful around the deer.  One bit my daughter and while it didn't break skin, left a large bruise.  She was not teasing nor tormenting the deer in any fashion, nor did she have any deer biscuits at the time.  Another deer took a nip at me also, but only managed to bit the keys in my pocket.The signs tell visitors to hold their hands up to the deer to show that you don't have any food for them, but this doesn't seem to work.There are plenty of other attractions in Japan where you won't be at risk of physical harm from the animals."
285,Feed the deer freely,"I went here with my daughter yesterday.  It was a fantastic morning out, I would highly recommend going here.  The deer were so friendly and literally ate out of your hand.  The biscuits are sold at the far gate for JPY 150.  Although when I bought the biscuits a small herd of deer came rushing up to me and I threw them to my daughter to take them as it freaked me out.  One deer bit my daughter on the side and she also stepped in deer pooh which is to be expected.  There are also limited hand washing, toilets and bins around the vicinity, take wipes and hand sanitiser.  A good place to go and only a 5 to 10 minute walk from the train station with some nice eateries and shops close by."
286,A day with the deers at Nara,"We spent a wonderful afternoon wandering through the park surrounded by the gorgeous deer. The atmosphere was calm and tranquil and feeding the deer their rice cakes was an absolute privilege. They are so gentle, even the ones who like to remind you that they’re there are not out to hurt you, they just want to give you a nudge to remind you that they’re there. We’ll definitely be back."
287,"Great 2+ hours to see deer & shrines, gardens","We went to this park and spent almost the whole day. It was so magical being with these lovely deers.We were taking pictures of the temples when a deer came. I was so excited. Then came another one and another one until I realized they are all over me. My brother came to me with the biscuits and we started feeding them. My rother told me that these deers knew how to bow if we bow at them. And they did.The park is so amazing with the temples, forest, deers and birds.There's a museum also, restaurants and some shops.I would love to come back again if chance permits."
288,Fun to see deer,"The deer here were VERY aggressive towards my children, they kept ramming them and knocking them down. One knocked my 3 year old son by the nub of a horn (they had already de-horned these creatures) and flung him through the air like a football. I hope that my children aren't traumatized from this experience, and I will be having them evaluated by a therapist for PTSD upon their return to the states."
289,Good for 2 hour visit,"Nice afternoon with the deers! They are tame when left alone. However do be cautionary when feeding them, some do bite and touch you when they see you holding the rice crackers. Some do tend to snatch papers (your map) from your hands, and they eat them. Or eat leftover rubbish on the ground. And the park does tend to get a little dirty with their dung. Perhaps park staff should look into these factors."
290,Socializing with deer...,"It is an awesome experience, not only for my boys, but also for the parents!  We are lucky we have a very informative tour guide who informed us on what to and not to do with the deer in the park to avoid aggressive behaviors of them.  If you feed them, they will surely gather around you, but they are trained too.  Just show them that you have empty hands, and they will leave you alone.  They were, so far, very friendly with us.  We definitely had a lot of fun!"
291,Nice place for relax ,"We came here first on a day-trip from Kyoto to see the hundreds of tame, free-roaming deer before proceeding to some of the temples located in the 1,600-acre park and elsewhere. A huge grassy area, covered by countless sika deer and a mob of visitors greeted us. Many people had stopped at vendors, who sell special rice crackers to feed the animals, which are protected with ""national treasure"" status in Japan. I thought they were real pests, pushing me and others from behind and sticking noses in pockets, demanding treats. One bit my tote bag but did not put a hole in it. As I had nothing to offer, they moved on quickly. Some became aggressive with those, who teased them with a treat and then withheld it. Sometimes, a group of deer would chase one or two visitors for handouts. Many of the animals allowed themselves to be petted and stood quietly for photos. Children seemed to be quite excited about being so close to the deer, laughing and stroking them. When the deer got tired of the attention and had consumed enough food, they would stride off or take a rest, many choosing a ditch at the side of a road for a respite.We stopped in this part of the park, because one of my friends had not been here before and was curious about the deer. Less than 10 minutes and she was ready to move on with us to the Todaiji Temple and Isuien Garden, two more of the attractions in the park. My rating is for the deer area."
292,"Great day out, lots of deer","Im glad we did go here. We were greeted by lots of deers. We didnt buy the cookie though but they still came and greeted us with a bow. Fun to watch them rest, mingle and even snatch your bag 😜 The backdrop view was great too. This is the nicest park Ive been so far"
293,Free roaming deer,"We really enjoyed our time in the park.  There are deer everywhere.  Most of them are pretty tame.  There were some that were over zealous for food.  We noticed that many of them bowed if you bowed to them.  The kids took a ton of selfies with them, so it was a good social media spot.  Just watch out for the tons of deer stuff all over the ground."
294,The poor deer ...,"I always imagined deers to be too uptight and ready to flee upon sensing the presence of people, but these deers made me appreciate them up close, so friendly. Be careful though feeding them, because once a deer gets a piece of acorn or deer food, the rest would gang up on you, crazy."
295,Amazing place,"Had an absolute blast feeding the deer here. First warning: the deer here are not shy. On the contrary, they can get quite aggressive. (parents of kids please take note!) Once they know you have food, they'll shove you, nip at your pants, push their noses into your hands, and basically do everything they can to get you to feed them. Second warning: there's deer poo everywhere. Don't wear flip flops, and choose a pair of shoes that you don't mind getting poo all over.Otherwise, this is a fantastic photo opportunity, and it's LOADS of fun to feed and bow to the deer. (yes they actually do bow, and it's hilarious!)"
296,Place for the whole family,Deers. Lots and lots of deers. Please dont wear your best shoes and watch your steps as there are deer poop everywhere. The stink is unmistakable. Be careful while feeding the deers and do not tease them.
297,"Love the lanterns, beware the bowing deer","I'm not big into animals or into getting to feed them, so I won't go into that much. Although if you would like to feed the deer, you can pay like 150 Yen to get some food for them. For me, I found visiting Nara in general to be a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle I'm used to living in Tokyo. It's such a serene and calm atmosphere. The deer will bow when they'd like to be fed and if you bow back, they expect to be fed. There were some little kids who were chasing the deer around and teasing them, please don't do that. It's not only not nice to the little guys, but it's extremely annoying for other people at the park."
298,Fun place to spend some time,"It's always a pleasure to watch animals allowed to roam free. No cages, just the freedom to wander, graze, look around and not be alarmed by human company. Nara Deer Park is one such haven. One can spend the entire day in this beautifully maintained nature park, bow to the deer and watch in sheer delight as they (seem) to bow back ! Watch them gently nudge people, in an attempt to cadge an animal cracker or two. It's a wonder that these lovely creatures don't run off the reservation as it were. For those academically inclined there is the Botanical Museum to visit, for an entry fee of course. Otherwise the deer park is free for visitors. There are shrines also, for the spiritually-inclined."
299,it's a nice park and the deer are a bonus,"I played with dear in the park, feed the deer crackers, and ate ice cream. What's not to like about that."
