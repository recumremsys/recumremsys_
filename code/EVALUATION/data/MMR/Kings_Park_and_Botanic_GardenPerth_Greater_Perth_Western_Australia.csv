0,Who doesn't love Kings Park ?!,"I try to go each spring to look at the amazing wildflowers. If you don't have time to drive hundreds of km's to find them, just do a day trip to Kings Park! At other times of the year, I love to walk around, ride my bike around and the view never ceases to amaze. Take a picnic, take a book, definitely take your camera!"
1,Overlooking the city,"Spring is the best time to visit with the abundant wildflowers, but really it's a wonderful place at any time of year. Either to sit and look at the views across the Swan River and Perth's CBD skyline or explore the botanical gardens full of native plants to WA, or wander through trails. There are cafes and playgrounds and so much more."
2,Excellent views.,We advise to go in the botanic garden through spring season because you've got all the famous desert flowers at this time of the year.You can enjoy a barbecue with your familly. There is a part for kids.
3,Absolutely amazing,"Every time you go to Kings Park, there are always new things to see, as far as new flowers blooming, the view of the City is forever changing, and there are different functions on for every season. Open Air Theatre. The ANZAC Dawn Service is always a very big attraction. Don't forget the Fuction Centre, my son had his wedding reception there, many years ago. I went up there in January just for a bucket of chips and a cup of coffee, a very relaxing place for the whole family, spend as little or as long as you like there?"
4,Beautiful historic old trees with pretty city view,We visited this botanical garden in the morning and we did a couple of hikes to explore some particular trees and plants.The botanical garden is very interesting and it's also free!
5,Most see this place! beautiful greens! lovely winds! memorable vibes!,Whenever we have visitors from overseas or interstate we always enjoy a walk through Kings Park We never tire of the views or scenery
6,A division of bushland minutes from the city,"There are lots of walking trails at Kings Park and Botanic Gardens.  As you walk you can learn about the flora and flowers as there are signs.  There is also an off leash area for the dogs.  Within the gardens there are also many other gardens to see.  Such as Water Garden, Roe Garden, and Banksia to name a few.  There is a walkway called the Lotterywest Federation Walkway.  It takes about 20 minutes to walk on the walkway each way.  The walkway is a pathway , elevated walkway and has a veiwing bridge.  Bring a hat and wear good shoes"
7,If you love nature then this is it,Don’t miss out on a chance to visit Kings Park and the Botanical Gardens - gorgeous native flowers and amazing views over Perth.  Such majestic tall trees and a really moving war memorial overlooking Perth.  Such a treat to have had the chance to visit  as the walks are really worth the trip.
8,Perfect Park!,"Spent a morning strolling around this beautiful park admiring the Perth skyline. It’s great for taking photos and enjoying the lovely plants, statues and views. The cafe is good for ice creams at the end of it, the salted caramel and macadamia nut Connoisseur choc bars are to die for!"
9,Iconic views,"Best view in town. Get exercise in the calm of nature. Free walking tours three times a day. Or lay on the lawn and do nothing. Even has had a place for a bit of shopping therapy ,great cafes and restaurants. And its free."
10,"Wonderful park, wonderful views","The Kings Park with its Botanical Garden is so big and rich in sights that one could spend hours in here, coming again on another day. Unfortunately I didn't have much time, so I just had a glimpse of it. At the Tourist Information Centre I got a leaflet with a map of the 'Western Australian Botanic Garden'. Several hikes are shown on it like the 'Cliff Walk', the 'Law Walk', the 'Lotterywest Federation Walkway', the 'Bushland Nature Trail' and the Botanic Garden Paths.On my rather short visit I got the chance to see the State War Memorial, the Queen Victoria Statue, surrounded by cannons, and the 'Gija Jumulu', a boab tree that had been brought here from 3200km away. An information board by the thick tree tells about it. Very enjoyable, besides all the nature, are the great views towards Perth CBD with its skyscrapers, towards Perth Water and the Narrows Bridge leading to South Perth."
11,turn on more lights at night,"Worth having a walk around the gardens and views are magnificent, try and make the time to view, you will not be disappointed.  Great café to sit and take it all in."
12,A most amazing place.,Absolutely beautiful! The gardens are fantastic for a stroll and to learn about the local flora. Plus the history behind the memorial site makes for a very nice outing.  Great for a picnic or the food at any of the cafes.
13,Most beautiful views,"We saw this park twice. It should not be missed on any visit. It was wonderful, so clean and lovely."
14,Don’t do it - absolute disgrace. ,The gardens are beautiful and well worth the long walk around them. You can walk from the city but it can be strenuous. Taking the free bus (route 935) is the less adventurous option
15,Definitely worth a visit,"We live in Perth and we always love to come visit this park. Great to have picnics, strolls, exercise and just to see the views of Swan river and Perth CBD and surrounds."
16,refresh,"Had family over from Canada and spent the day walking around Kings park. Lots of fun, yabbies in the ponds, playground for the kids, great views from the whole site."

You can find a nice place to have a breakfast around there as well!Family trips - romantic dates - friends gatherings!have a good day everyone!
18,Stunning Stunning Stunning !,Whether its looking at the wildflowers and shrubs or diversity of birdlife Kings Park has it for you. Great photo ops of Perth and the river and enjoy refreshing cool as the Fremantle Doctor blows by in the arvo. Lots of History too as you wander and read the monuments scattered through the Park. Of course a climb up the DNA viewing platform and a stroll across the glass bridge is not to be missed. For those inclined there are plenty of Pokemon about. A great place to wander about.
19,Forgotten how beautiful it was,"Don't forget the excellent Botanical Garden, of the gift shop! You need at least half a day to appreciate this Park."
20,Enjoyable Morning at Kings Park,"A great place to visit, wonderful views of Perth.You can easyly spend a full day in the park.I'd recommend a picnic in the park watching the sun go down.A must  see in Perth."
21,Simply a stunning place!,"Had a half day at the end of a vacation and decided to wander.  This is one of the most amazing city parks I have ever seen.  Even in the summer with over 37 degree temps and bright sun, it is amazing.  The views of Perth and Fremantle are incredible. Plant selection is perfect. There are plenty of water fountains to keep you hydrated in the summer, but wear sunscreen and a hat.Shop and Cafe were great little places.  Staff very helpful,  this is definitely a must do on any visit to Perth,  even if it’s your tenth time traveling here.  You will never tire of the beauty."
22,Remommend! In the comment some tips,The gift shop has lovely momentos to purchase. The park well kept. We were on a tour with a person who had been there once before and she definitely wanted to go back.  There are sloping hills in the park. Plants are well labed. It is worth a look if you love plants and the environment. There is lots of parking for cars near by and tour bus parking as well.
23,Best place for an evening run!,Very nice gardens with lots of big trees and space for a picnic. You’ll find groups of friends or families enjoying themselves on the shade under the trees or playing on the green lawn. Lots to see and easy walks. Early evening is perfect to see the city of Perth lights! Breathtaking views!
24,The pride of Perth,"Love the vast space in the park and the different sections in the garden. We heard so much from the passionate guide Helen during the 10am - 11.30am guided walk of the garden although there was intermittent rain throughout the walk and chilly with the winds. She continued to share with us the different types of flora etc despite the rain, also lent her umbrella to follow walkers in the group. An amazing learning walk there. Lotteywest federation walkway (May be closed when raining / strong winds) and the city skyline view around the park are certainly recommended. Very welcoming place for a morning walk after breakfast and getting off a flight  and getting close to greenery."
25,very nice place to walk and relax,"We visited early morning, had a delicious breakfast and then walked around the Park visiting different exhibits.The Botanical Gardens were excellent set out in different regions.The tree walk was great showing wonderful views of the city."
26,Biodiversity at its best,Went here for a relaxing picnic close to the Zamia cafe.The grounds are amazingly manicured and plenty of shade.We have no children but was still able to find a relative secluded spot to enjoy the day.Toilets close and also Zamia cafe if you feel like a formal meal.
27,Enjoy a stroll through the well maintained park,I visited this park on a hot day at the end of February. Beautiful and relaxing place. Fabulous views on the river. Excellent information centre and very helpful staff. One of the best things is that an entry to the park is free and a free red CAT bus can take you there. I will certainly return !
28,Beautiful....a must do!,"Twice on our little minivacation in Perth, we went for a run to Kings Park. Love the open spaces and the topography makes our run that more challenging."
29,Peaceful,"Such a relaxing place to wander, lie down amongst the trees and take various walks to learn some history. We didn't have long in the gardens but they were very lovely to see.There is a memorial drive too which is very picturesque, and would be nice to ride bikes down so you can stop and read the plaques of the departed soldiers."
30,Great views,I did not get to go to this big beautiful park during thee day or even all of it but the view at night was amazing and well worth it. The view at night is beautiful. You get to see the whole city lit up. I got to see the flame that never goes out and had some friends tell a bit about everything. I wish I got to see more of this large park but to just see the over view of the city at night was well worth it.
31,Free bus to the garden and park,"We were lucky enough to visit and see the wild flowers, in particular the kangaroo paw which came in a variety of sizes and colours including black.   Easy to access on the free Perth bus, great view of the Swan basin."
32,Fabulous Park with spectacular City Views,"Good walk around.Lots of plants and trees.Beautifully kept.Walked along the glass bridge, its not very long. Great views of the city.Enjoyed our vist."

34,Fantastic views,"Went for a long afternoon walk in Kings Park. Truly a tranquil experience. The park is beautifully done, with spectacular views of Perth. They truly pay proper homage to the veterans at the war memorial located in the park. In Perth this is a must see."
35,my fav place in perth,"During our extended holiday to Australia, we visited the King’s Park Botanical Garden in Perth. This is one of the largest botanical gardens in the world with large lawns and a fantastic view across the Swan River. The park exhibits an amazing large variety of Australian flora. The large lawns are ideal for a family picnic and very clean gas burners are available free of charge to prepare a barbecue. A wonderful experience!"

39,A must visit if in Perth,Walked a very small portion Kings Park Botanical Gardens. The walk ways are very excess-able for every one no matter your age. The views overlooking Perth's city skyline and beyond are stunning. The Swan river so beautiful.  Free walking tours with guides to explain the different flora. Loved the big Boab tree. Lots of rest areas to sit and relax. There is a walk bridge to see even more stunning views.

41,Beautiful gardens with equally stunnning views,"Wish I could have spent more time here, stunning views of the harbor. The gardens and flowers were gorgeous."
42,Another oasis of calm in a busy city,The garden is spectacular and we visited it 4 times during our stay in Perth. It is a wonderful place to learn about the flora and fauna and around every corner is something new to discover. The views of the city and the waterways are a nice addition.
43,Great Day Out,It is worth a visit here for the view. The gardens are well looked after and you can spend hours just wandering about. Plenty of seats around when you need a rest. You can take a picnic or there is a cafe.The cat bus drops off at the entrance.
44,Well Manicured Park With Stunning Views,"Before visiting, I thought it would be more like an oversized botanic garden, like in Melbourne.  I was a bit disappointed that most of it is wild bushland, with some gardens around the edge.  Whilst it is great to have this in a city area, it was not what I expected.  It does though have magnificent views of Perth city and the Swan River."
45,Big Beautiful Park,"Simply an awesome display of wildflowers is a parkland setting that is easy to walk, ride or run through"
46,Amazing park with all kinds of walking trails and flowers,"Lovely place to come visit if you are staying in Perth, especially if the weather is nice. They have free toilet blocks around the park and multiple drinking fountains."
47,Beautiful botanic garden  in Perth.,"Like the glass bridge and the relax atmosphere : people having a picnic, jogging and walking with the whole family.  Quite a lot of unusual plants to see as well. Should have a clearer signage. We walked in a hot day and have difficulties of finding the exit. There’s also no waiting area for Uber. A bit difficult to leave the location for Uber driver to pick us up."
48,Soo lovely!,If you visit one location in Perth it has to be Kings Park!There are views across the Swan River which are truly stunning.Great for a picnic or just a stroll.Perth has a free bus service so to get to Kings Park costs you nothing!
49,Beautiful gardens,One of my favourite places on the planet. By day or night I love it.Lots to see and amazing views over Perth and the bay.
50,Lots to see and do here and all free,Great day on a Sunday in spring. There were lots of families everywhere. We walked around several areas of the park for an hour or two. There are bush trails for cycling and walking and then more curated areas typical of a botanical garden. The glass bridge is great and the ANZAC lawn has panoramic views of Perth and the swan river. A nice day out.We walked back to the mall in the city and it took about 30 mins. We also walked to the park earlier in the day from west Leederville station. Took about 30 mins but saved parking which looked a nightmare while wildflower festival was on.
51,Tranquility and beauty in central Perth,We walked through this park and was very impressed with some of the views you could see from it. The grass was absolutely immaculately well done and to see so many varieties of plants was very interesting. It is a very popular place as there were lots of people walking around enjoying it. They even had a concert happening in it the night we were there.
52,So well worth worth a visit for the wonderful views and the plants & trees,Loved this park. So many gorgeous gardens and points of interest. Nice cafe. Would recommend for families couples or singles. It has stunning views over the river at several points.
53,Relaxing Time,Can have a beautiful view of Perth from here. The park is beautiful and have lots of green trees.A good place to have a picnic while enjoying the spectacular view.
54,Beautiful space,"Whether you're looking to see Perth from a good angle, find a park to have a picnic or kick a ball with a kid, or go for a walk and read all the signs about the fauna and flaura, KP has it all. Enjoy. Free parking too. Also a number of restaurants to get something to eat or drink if necessary. Plenty of restrooms and shade too."
55,Beautiful oasis in heart of city,"Today was overcast and a little humid, but Kings Park always offers something. The birds were out in flocks savouring the flowers, and the view, magnificent as usual!I had scrambled eggs, presented with spinach and herbs...a very large serving, too big for me! The coffee was nice, having my fav. Hazelnut Latte.Good company, good food and amazing views mixed with nature. ( Kookaburras hunting for their own breakfast under the trees)"
56,Stroll through Park.,Beautiful gardens to visit on a sunny day and enjoy to views overlooking the city of Perth. Able to drive around or walk. May different species of plants.
57,beautiful,"Great views from Fraser Avenue over the City and Perth Water. Don’t miss it if you are visiting Perth - the locals already know how lovely it is. Walkable from the city ... just go up the hill westward on St George’s Terrace and turn left at the roundabout at the top. There are buses as well, of course, if the hill is too steep."
58,Gorgeous manicured gardens and lovely walks,Very well kept park. Fantastic views over the city. Botanically interesting for those who are interested and for the others a nice walk in a beautiful environment!

60,Beautiful place for a walk and to take in city views,It is a very big park with plenty to see and many pathways. Beautiful native flowers and many views of Perth and the Swan River. Tips:Take plenty of water and fly repellent.
61,Night is best,We drove nearly the entire park on bicycle and enjoyed the views of the Swan River and the downtown.  The parks are lovely with fantastic play escapes for children and plenty of places to relax in the shade.
62,Great tree top walk,We went for a leisurely walk in Kings Park recently with our dog. It's fantastic that dogs are allowed on leash in this reserve. Lots of reserves have total dog bans so this is exceptional that you can enjoy the beauty of the park and walk down the many trails and just enjoy the scenery. It was pretty hot this day so the grassed areas were a safe option for walking the dog when not walking along shaded pathways.There were lots of people with their furry friends as well as families and visitors.
63,Kings Park View,"We came here in 2010 and I really loved the bush lands around and all the lovely local flowers which were so different from the term flowers is usually associated with. This time it was no different. Very well kept, very interesting place especially in the cool weather we had. Do take a walk around and spend time to view the many plants and flowers!"
64,Just the Sunset,"Walking in the shaded areas on a hot day , Fantastic. The views are spectacular , the grounds are clean, my kid of place."
65,Fantastic Park and Gardens ,Caught the free bus (excellent) to the park then spent several hours walking around this marvellous park and gardens. Great views out across Perth & river too. A brilliant introduction to the plants & birds of Western Australia.

68,Beautiful!,"A very beautiful place to visit and walking distance from Perth CBD. The flowers are beautiful, the bushes that summon all the birds to happily play in them are Devine. It is close to the city and has brilliant views of the Swan River. There is even a bridge for the daring and adventurist to walk across while marveling at  the surrounding unique plants and trees.Thee is a Coffe shop and eatery very close and I recommend all visitors to Perth wester Australia to come and see with their own eyes the magnificent Kings Park and Botanical gardens"
69,Great views of Perth CBD and gorgeous relaxing place to be.,"Kings Park has everything for a relaxing day out.  The view of Perth and the river below are amazing.

72,Fantabulous,"Worth to visit, beautiful scenery with the city view and lake. Came in February, nice weather and windy."

79,Picturesque views,"Kings park has a lot of different spots to have a picnic, with a view of the city, or just near the bubbling brook, it is relaxing and a great place for the kids to play."
80,Highlight of a Perth visit,"I went to Kings Park to enjoy the view on Perth CBD but the park offers so much more than the view. It's an oasis in the city where people come to relax, have a picknick or a drink. The atmosphere is really relaxed.Next to King's Park, which also harbours an impressive war memorial, cafe and the visitor information, you'll find the Botanical Gardens. Yes, they are not as spectacular as other botanical gardens, but they're still worth seeing. Do not miss the Federation Walkway (open until 5 pm, free entrance).I would definitely recommend the park to everyone visiting Perth, as it's a place to relax and calm down."
81,A day in nature,A variety of species of plants and animals can be found here. A very beautiful and educative your. Will recommend it to one and all...

83,Spring is in the air ,Views to keep in your minds eye for ever and a tremendous selection of well nurtured plants. Great cafe and shop.
84,Walk in the park,"Every time we visit Perth, Kings Park is somewhere we make a point of revisiting.It is a truly wonderful park and is really quite spectacular. We took our Perth based grandchildren with us and although they go there often with their parents, its usually only to the extensive playground. This time we took them to the tree top walk which they thoroughly enjoyed and to the war memorial and to the 'whispering' seat which astounded them-they couldn't work out how someone whispering 50 metres away could be clearly heard at the other end of the circular seating-i have to admit that it was quite amazing.The entire park is so well maintained and i love the way soldiers who died in WW1  are remembered by the plaques placed under trees all along memorial drive. That was also something the 'Grandies' hadn't seem before.The views of Perth from the park are unbeatable and are always a highlight for me.If you're visiting Perth this really is a 'must see'"
85,Beautiful Park,"Kings park is truely awesome, there is so much to do! You can simply go for a walk or bike ride to explore the park or run the stairs if you’re more energetic. There are playgrounds and many large grass areas. It’s beautiful to have an afternoon picnic in the shade and then watch the sunset next to the city skyline. They have outdoor movies in summer that are always enjoyable, you can hire beanbags but take a blanket as it gets chilly when the sun goes down. It’s awesome to have such a massive park so close to the city"
86,Kings Park always changing,"If you visit little ol Perth you must visit Kings Park, the views out across the city are stunning, you must visit during the day & at night, lovely to take a picnic. The park has something for everyone, you can see a concert, you can see our wildflowers, you can exercise, picnic, take photos, visit the memorials, heaps of kids playgrounds."
87,The Inner City Getaway,"Especially now, to appreciate nature, and what a gorgeous, huge space Kings Park is. Easy to practice social distancing. First time in awhile that I felt I was breathing truly fresh air."
88,Beautiful park with great views,Strolled here from our hotel and despite the overcast day the city views were great. Spent time looking at the various war memorials covering several conflicts which was moving. Had a fabulous lunch in the Botanical Cafe in the park. Well worth a visit and would be a lovely place for a picnic and chilling when the sun is out!
89,Beautiful park,Kings Park is beautiful and has amazing views!You can relax and walk around the whole park at leisure without rushing as there is free parking... the only place with free parking around Perth... so enjoy the time and views without rushing.
90,Perfect,"The Botanical Gardens are amazing in their own right, however when you also experience the elevated views of the river and city it is first class."
91,Must do on any trip to Perth!,A really restful place in the middle of the city.  Signage interpreting flora throughout.  Grassy areas allow for picnics wherever you like.
92,Always stunning,"Beautiful gardens but visited on a very very hot day.  Lovely views of the Swan River.Beautiful tourist shop with upmarket goods like glassware, plates etc.  Loved browsing all their stuff.Had to buy a bottle of ice cold water which was very expensive that the lady selling had to warn us of the price to ensure we really wanted it.Spent a couple of hours there and found it well worth it."
93,Defiantly worth a visit! ,The park is lush and green with great views. The cafe was busy and we had a delicious lunch there. The gift shop is truly an art lovers place to browse and perhaps find a treasure. We walked through the park for a little while but found in the heat of 35 degrees it was too hot for us and not enough shade. Worth a visit and it is in the free transit zone.

The shop next door is stocked with many beautiful  artwork  from WA artists."

98,Great scenic and peaceful ,"Great views down over the river are and some fantastic photos of the shoreline. Very nice botanical settings with plenty of walkways in shade. Decent coffee shop at the start where the buses drop people off at the carpark.Popular with people holding bridal showers which is sweet !If you are looking for the Perth Explorer bus stops, they are mostly well hidden in the shrubbery."
99,Beautiful scenery,Walking take a picnic lunch and enjoy! So much to see and if you like walking you will enjoy. If you like to just sit and look at the. It’s you will enjoy!

105,Musee visit whilst in Perth,"Kings's Park is our number 1 place to visit when we go to Perth. It is glorious no matter what the season, but Spring is my favourite time when the place comes alive with colour, smells and wild life. We always find something new each time we go and this visit was no different. We found many different plants on our trip around and also the weirdest bird called a Frogmouth, looks like an owl but is no relation. Thanks to a local who just happened to come along and explain what it was. We always use the amazing free transport around Perth, so there was no problem with parking etc. The bus goes from the centre of Perth and is very regular, at least 3/4 an hour I think. We had morning coffee, lunch and afternoon tea there in differnet establishments, all good and freshly made. You need the whole day there to appreciate the space."
106,Lovely place to visit early morning,"Fantastic day out. Great views, stunning gardens with water fountains. Tree top walk was also lovely.walked in the gardens and then relaxed on the grass and enjoyed the views with a picnic. Perfect"

114,Stunning,Kings Park and Botanical garden is an exceptional place to walk and see real nature right next to the city It feels like a natural forest with the smells and incredible views that will take your breath away. Views of the river from glass bridge are a sight to see.
115,A visit to King’s Park in Perth,We visited the park twice during our visit to Perth. The first visit was at night to see the city skyline. It was very impressive. The second visit was on Christmas to walk the botanical gardens. We like visiting the botanical gardens at all of the cities we go to and this was among the best. Very nice walking trails and plants.  The war memorial was very interesting.
116,Lovely walk,"King's park is awesome, and HUGE!Some areas are thoroughly tamed and gardened, while the bulk of it is natural bush.Zamia cafe is the pick of the eateries...In springtime, October/November, the wildflowers are spectacular, but at any time of year the abundance of different trees and plants is a credit to the curators.Plus, the views over the city and Swan river are unforgettable."
117,A pleasant walk with great views of the city and river!,It is beautiful !! Kids can go wild run around and there is also a play area for kids with activities to do. It is huge so one has to plan in advance. It also has movie screenings in open.
118,A quiet wide park,"The walk through Kings park is so relaxing and a place of many thoughts when your walk among the tall memorial trees. The views of the swan river, Perth City, South Perth, and all areas a the best"
119,Very nice park,"Probably one of the top ten, if not top five, parks I have ever visited. The walkways, ponds, architectural features, and  grassy open spaces speckled with trees are beautifully paired with the bay view.  I wish I had known.  I would have planned a couple hours to bring a blanket, picnic, and frisbee.  Do try to carve some time out for you and nature at this park.  You will be well rewarded!"
120,amazing,Lots of information about the flora and forna in WA and how unique they are compared to the rest of Australia. Some great views of the CBD and river on offer here and walking.
121,Fantastic Day Out,"Amazing place to walk through with the kids, many play areas for them to play in, heaps to see and do. Awesome views of the Perth Skyline."
122,Beautiful as always ,Great place to chill out with family or friends. The environment is so nice and clean. We had few activities and games there such as reciting poem.
123,Kings Park is a very large urban native Parkland in very close proximity to Perth City.,The sightseeing is beautiful you get a good view of the city od Perth and the Swan River.Also the war memorial and the surrounding areas
124,Great place to relax and enjoy life,You could literally spend hours here! A fantastic place to go for sunset and watch the world go by. It did not disappoint
125,"Kings Park, Perth W.A",This is the place my family visit whenever we holiday in Perth. Well maintained! Spacious! No crowd in most morning
126,Beautiful Sightseeing,It just amazes me that you have such beauty in the heart of the city The gardens are pristine and the views Would love to go back in spring to see the wildflowers in bloom Would strongly recommend a visitTake a picnic and enjoy on 1 of the many lawn areas
127,Kings park,"Vast, but most interesting points are fairly close together. Brilliant views of the river Swan and Perth. Botanical gardens are well maintained. Good cafe, playground to keep kids amused. The hop on hop off bus stops at 3 points within the park- that's how big it is!"
128,Some thing for everyone,"This is definitely a place to go to when in Perth .Beautiful gardens , great views , lovely place to take children for a picnic . There are also lots of walking tracks ."
129,The jewel in Perth's crown,Had a lovely walk around the park today.  Well worth a visit.  Lots to see.  Can spend an hour or a day.
130,Spectacular,"Really enjoyed coming here everything is pristine and the views over Perth are special, there were a few people here not not over busy and a lot of walk through the trees and springs"
131,Beautiful park in the middle of a city,We were staying approx 2klm from here. It is beautiful. Beautiful way for a lazy hour in the park. There was a wedding being photographed there and the back drop was great.
132,Great park,"We went there twice during our stay in Perth.  Not only is the park beautifully arranged, it is also very interesting and provides visitors with valuable information about the flora, fauna and and animals in Western Australia. Definitely worth a visit."
133,"Beautiful Park, great walks","We went to Kings Park again this morning with family members from Brazil and, even though we've been here possibly hundreds of time before, the magic of this wonderful place still grabbed us. Of course, the views of the City across the Swan are unsurpassed but strolling through the park, enjoying the landscaped areas, as well as the natural bushland, makes one realise how lucky the people of Perth are! There's something for everyone here, open parkland for families to socialise and picnic in, plantings of common and rare botanical specimens from all over Western Australia, beautiful walks which provide landscapes that change with the seasons. It is clear that the people who run this marvellous park really care about it, as do nearly every inhabitant of Perth. International travellers might tell you about the marvellous parks in London (I know they are great - I lived in London for 22 years), Paris, Berlin, New York and San Francisco. I can tell you from experience, Kings Park knocks them all into a cocked hat! This park is worth making a special trip to Perth for!"
134,Highly recommended,"The Botanic gardens are worth a visit for so many reasons: a superb collection of Australian plants arranged by geographic location, great views over the city and river, lots of walks in the bushland area, an excellent gallery/gift shop and very good free guided tours. The gardens are vast and not to be missed."
135,Beautiful Place to Picnic,"Have spent a number of days visiting Kings Park, and also attended a Boho picnic, here, over November and December. My daughter had a few medical appointments prior to a surgery in December, so KP was a great stop in-between appointments, and during surgery. Love the Cafe and the Aspects Gallery/shop. So many unusual gift and art ideas.The cafe food was lovely and i felt it was also reasonably priced.... and who can beat the views of our stunning city and surrounds! How lucky we are, to have such beautiful gardens and our amazing War Memorial, in this outstanding location. Definitely worth a visit!"
136,a place to easily spend a day,"This is truly a must visit when coming to Perth, a magnificent Botanical Garden. The views of the harbour and onwards are absolutely stunning. Plan this in."
137,Wonderful views over Perth from these gardens. ,"This park has paths and views that cater for all. From full on bush walks, to gentle strolls on maintained and signed pathways. The gardens are well maintained and present great photo opportunities."
138,Fantastic,The wildflowers in full bloom and the whole place was amazingly manicured / the gardens were amazing and the view was great
139,An easy walk in the park,"Stunning views over Swan River, city and a fabulous sky. Cafes and good parking; really liked the native plants - inspirational."
140,Beautiful ,This is a gorgeous oasis right in the City. A must for the best City Skyline photos. The Best shots from near the War Memorial are breathtaking.The Botanical Gardens are lovely and relaxing with plenty of space to chill and relax. The gift shop is packed with great local crafts....allow time to visit it!
141,"Lovely Park, leave a lot of time!","This is just a fantastic place to visit, great for all ages and all abilities. This is a massive Park, with natural bush and trees, plants and shrubs from all over the world. And just to top that off the views over the city of Perth are breathtaking. Well worth a visit. My Wife and I just love this place."
142,Beautiful afternoon walk,"A park, botanic gardens and war memorials; a must see! The walkway through the trees overlooks the river providing great views."
143,Beautiful tranquil place,"Like many others we always visit King’s Park when we come to Perth.  January is probably not the best time, but it is still spectacular.  There is a shop and a café at the top end, and we explore the native garden close to here.  There have been new developments with a big sign, new paths and a pergola.  But I am most impressed with the garden itself: obviously planted and maintained by people who love their work, and many plants with neat labels.  And it is good to see the giant baobab tree doing well."
144,Beautiful gardens and natural vegetation,"Loved my visits to Kings Park. The buses going to Kings Park from the city center (CAT Buses) are 100% free, so make sure you use them, you can do plenty of walking in the gardens.Kings Park is perfect for those who are into plants or photography, but also for families who just want to take a bit of time and relax in the beautiful surroundings of the park. Perfect place for a picnic!For me as a solo traveler, the free guided tours were perfect.The lotterywest federation walkway is very pretty and gives you a great view of the Swan River.Note; there are not many trash cans in the park. So make sure that you carry a bag with you! Staff at the visitor center is lovely. Good selection of food & drink options at the ‘restaurant’ and lovely gift selection at the gift shop."
145,Beautiful gardens with great views of the city.,"Great place to spend all day, walking around and exploring. Lots of cafes , coffee shops around for food and drinks. No age limit for this attraction the park caters for every age."
146,"A bit disappointed, most of it is wild, but great views of city.","Wide free park.Large range of plants. A very shop with very useful books.Nice place to spend part of the day, just walking around.Good written explanation on panels.Just one comment on glass bridge : do not expect any scary place. It is a normal bridge, only sides are transparent..."
147,Beautiful park,It's really nice to see how they maintained and kept the trees and all for such long time. very relaxing to be there.
148,Beautiful park ,"Kings park and Botanic Gardens is a great place to go as a family .... beautiful view of the city, time with mother nature, time to walk, time to play ... enjoy a picnic lunch/brunch with family and/or friends."
149,Beautiful gardens to see and relax,"Well worth a visit to this lovely park. The walk through the Botanical Garden was excellent and made it to the walkway, not as far as I thought. Lovely views of Perth along the way. An ideal place for wheelchair visitors."
150,Lovely walking trails,One thing I really liked about this beautiful garden is that throughout there were paths  suitable for a wheelchair.  Might be a bit of a push going uphill in places.  Lots of trees provide protection from the sun. Cafe service was too slow - not enough staff.  Gift/souvenir shop is excellent - very large selection.
151,A walk in the Park,Couldn't believe how big this place was. Well kept gardens with so much to see. Great views of the city.
152,Tranquility in the City,We had a great walk around the park and botanical gardens.  Fantastic views of the city of Perth skyline and the Swan river. The park and gardens cover a large area so give yourself a good bit of time if you want to see it all. There are several toilets throughout the park. There are restaurants and a really good shop close to the large car park. It’s free to enter a well worth visiting.
153,Beautiful relaxing place to visit,"What a beautiful place! We only had half an hour to stroll round but you could easily spend an entire day or two walking around the different gardens, look out points, memorials and coffee shops! If you’re visiting Perth this is a must do!"
154,Stunning,"One of the few free destinations in Perth that is absolutely worth visiting, Kings Park is MASSIVE. You can spend pretty much half a day here enjoying the beautifully manicured gardens, flowers and wildlife here. Just take note that the glass bridge (a metal bridge with glass sides) is only open from 9am to 5pm."
155,make a day of it,an amazing place to visit a few attraction and a very nice memorial garden and walk a beautiful view point over Perth aswell
156,Just fabulous,"Stayed across the Road in the Quest KinPark 10 days and Ran 10-Klms a day in Kings, every Run was an adventure .Views of Perth Stunning"
157,A good place to visit,"This park is a natural wonder in the middle of the city, beautiful views of the city, interesting war memorials, cafes and restaurants. There’s a suspended bridge walk through the gardens, bring your walking shoes there’s a lot to see!"
158,Fantastic views and great location,Wonderful place with lots of diffferent areas and themes.View of the Swan river from the park is breath taking.
159,Fabulous city park,"A must to visit- flowering gums in all colours, beautiful vast flora, great design. Simply so beautiful. One of the best parks in the world."
160,Beautiful park,"This is a must see when visiting Perth with fantastic views of the city and the Swan river..There’s heaps of walking trails,all kinds of beautiful flowers and birds.They even have concerts and a cafe too ...the only downside to visiting Kings Park is it can get very crowded during the peak season yet the park is big enough where you can still trek alone without a lot of people near you...definitely worth a visit"
161,Great open spa e,Model park in that it's huge and well-maintained with incredible views.  We thought Perth was a beautiful city.
162,A haven in the city,"The people of Perth have a real gem here. This massive park has something for everyone to enjoy and explore. Amazing views, plants and wildlife on a huge scale. On an evening lovely restaurants and an occasional outdoor cinema."
163,Absolutely stunni g,"While staying in Perth we took the free bus to Kings Park and Botanic Gardens.We spent some time looking around.The gardens are beautifully layed out and we were lucky enough to be there when there was a festival. There was a lot happening, with music  and food outlets.This is a must do when in Perth."
164,Great Family Outing,"Fantastic park , a lots of activities for kids ,with very clean bathroom.The lake is very nice to have a picnic around, and the glace bridge really cool, and is for free"
165,A worth while escape,Beautiful scenery but the inner park was closed due to the heat and possible bush fire. We only canvassed the outer park facing the lake.
166,Took afternoon there,Kings park is verynice place to visit especially in the evening where you get a beautiful view of the entire city and you have people just sitting on the grass and benches and doing nothing but watching the views with some wine and small snacks.
167,Day Visit,Beautiful views of Perth city from Kings Park. Ample parking. Cafe at the park which was nice to stop in for a drink after walking around the park. Have been here during the day and in the evening and both times have encountered pretty colours in the sky. Lots of old historic trees to admire. There’s grassed areas too if wanting to rest awhile.
168,The Women’s’ garden,Beautiful spot with fantastic views of Perth . Cafe in the park is good with views again. Botanical gardens have lots of informative signs.
169,Beautiful place to spend time in,"This beautiful park is located on a very large hill overlooking the Swan River. There are many pathways including treetop walks, so many different trees and plants, water features, and cafes. The views were lovely that we went there twice during our visit in Perth. The first time, we walked there. The second time, we took the free Cat bus that travels around the city center."
170,Walk around,"We visited here in 2016, so when we decided that we were going to Australia did more research into Kings Park. It was well worth it. Our resident hosts were not aware of the glass bridge, so a first for both couples. Reminisced at the views over the city. to be able to walk further into the park was very enjoyable with many plants and trees to see."
171,Grand Park with a Grand View,Easily accessible with fantastic views overlooking the city and river. Lots of walking paths and many grassy areas to relax in and soak up the views. We caught the free 935 bus to the park.
172,Peace and quiet.,"Great place to relax and soak up the amazing views of the river and city below, beautiful old trees and amzing gardens to walk through."
173,Never Disappointed!,"Fabulous view of Perth city and the river from Kings Park. Lovely walks and special play and interactive areas for the children.Nice restuarant if you want something a bit fancy or cafe for coffees and ice creams etc.Plenty of parking areas around the gardens, plus areas for picnics and group functions.I highly recommend anyone visiting Perth visits Kings Park.You can see Elizabeth Quay from there and watch the ferries crossing the Swan river."
174,beautiful views,"Please go to see views and flowers. A large area of preserved bush with beautifully maintained gardens as well,  fantastic views. The gallery is worth a visit, pity about luggage constraints"
175,Holiday 2020,My wife and I visited the Kings Park and Botanic Gardens on a warm afternoon in March. We arrived by a Perth explorer hop on hop off bus and left by one. There is a wonderful view of the city and Swan river from the park. The state war memorial is in the park overlooking the river. A few minutes from the memorial you can enter the botanic park. The diversity of plant life is amazing with everything labelled in common name plus Latin name. There were interesting walkways and areas to sit amongst the plants.Overall a great afternoon out.
176,Lovely gardens,This is where we came to spend some time on our one day in town.  The bus took us here and once we arrived we wandered around to enjoy the great green space and lovely plantings.  Some great views as well.
177,Beautiful big and small,These fantastic gardens are a must see in Perth. Lovely views over the city due to their elevated location. The gardens are very extensive and the botanic section is beautifully maintained and interesting. There are nature trails and a really good cafe. Tough walk up so you could use free bus 935 to go up and stroll down.
178,Great way to spend the day,This place is a must when visiting Perth. The city views are fantastic. The raised walkway is a great experience. The visitors centre offers lots of valuable information from super-friendly volunteers.
179,Great day out,"Where to begin!! We had a glimpse of  the wonderful area of bushland which is King's Park, from the top deck of the Hop-on/Hop-off bus. How we wished we had had more time in Perth as we could have spent a day exploring this wonderful place, and even then would not have done it justice!! What we did do, however, was spend several hours exploring the sensational Botanic Gardens, with its amazing views of Perth and the Swan River. Where to begin!! We so very much enjoyed wandering around the well signposted paths, exploring the huge range of native trees, shrubs, plants and flowers, the themed areas, the walkway and the stunning birdlife. And how beautifully kept everywhere is! We visited several botanic gardens on our tour of Australia, and none compare with Perth Botanic Gardens (in our opinion!). Simply magnificent. We just loved it there. Be sure to visit, you won't regret it."
180,Kings Park,Beautiful walk with a friend and coffee overlooking the city. It was raining but they have big umbrellas out the front so it did not spoil our catch up.The flora is nothing short of magnificent.
181,Great place for a walk and meal,"Nice sunny day so we decided to visit Kings Park which we haven't done for any years now, and am very thankful we did. It was beautiful. We had forgotten just how wonderful the park is and how blessed we are to have such a large wonderful park on the outskirts of the city centre. Gardens were well maintained, amazed by just how much greenery there was, and the walk we did was very relaxing. Plenty of places to stop for a rest or to take in the great views. It is winter so obviously there were not many wildflowers to see, but there was more than enough to keep us very satisfied. We will certainly do this again but this time we will take. picnic lunch so that we can enjoy it much more."
182,A must-do!,Great place to visit whilst in Perth.  Can get a free bus (935) to the park.  The walk along the coast hilltop path was great with its treetop section.  Good signs explaining about flora and fauna.  Good restaurant and bar and cafe.
183,Another great visit,"With so much to see here, I'd recommend spending a full day here really. Theres so much to see and to stroll around all of it you should give it plenty of time.We had to park a short walk away because the main car park was full. Perhaps this is because we visited on a weekend? But either way it wasnt a problem to walk back to the visitor centre. We started with an ice cream from the little cafe, it was a hot day and much needed. We then wandered down to the memorial which is hauntingly beautiful, a really special tribute indeed. The views of the city from here are second to none. You can see for miles and it's hard to take it all in! The perfect picture opportunity for sure. We the wandered round d all the different gardens this place had to offer. Each one was super well maintained and easy to navigate. Pathways are wide which would be perfect for prams. The treetop walk is a short but high bridge over the trees with again more beautiful views of the brewery below and across the river. It really was stunning all round.It was never too crowded anywhere inparticular. People were dotted around enjoying the views or having picnics, nowhere was crammed with people despite the car park being pretty busy.Could have easily spent all day here!"
184,Fabulous vantage point,What a brilliant park...so much to see with amazing views and walkways.  Also easily accessible with buses or walking both doable options.Well worth a visit....
185,Wild Spring Flowers,"Visited here on New Years Day 2020.  What a beautiful, tranquil place even though there were hundreds of people out celebrating. The gardens are very well maintained and the monuments are a sight to behold.  We wandered through the park and saw a lot of regeneration of plants, they really are trying hard to reintroduce plants/trees back into WA.  Such a lovely, clean place.  The views over Perth City and Elizabeth Quay are amazing.  Well worth a visit."
186,Well worth the trip. Views of Perth are fantastic,"Clean, well kept gardens with native plants, not overly manicured.  Lots of freedom to sit and lie down on any grass patch-to soak in the sun and atmosphere. Easy gentle slopes for pleasant walk. Take city bus directly into the heart of the park if you don’t want to walk too much.  For a more ambitious day, walk from Elizabeth Quay, up the hill.  The WW1 memorial is an important monument."
187,Better than last time,"Lovely, cool, interesting.  My husband and I enjoyed visiting Perth and its parks.  A welcoming city with friendly people."
188,Great piece of nature near Perth,"My review is mainly about the city view,We decided to take in the Sunset over our beautiful city from the excellent vantage point at Kings Park.We had our dog with us who was on lead (though some weren't) and sat on a rug with just some Dips and Biscuits.The atmosphere was friendly as it was a warm night, also the bugs were out so make sure to take something for the bites.The view was wonderful as usual and the only thing that would have made the night better would be more benches placed around towards the view as some of us can not sit on the ground for too long.we will be back before the weather starts to cool down."
189,"Nice Park, great free tour","King's Park is an absolute must see when in Perth. The main draw for me were the views from along Fraser Avenue, which are draw-droppingly stunning - panoramic views of the Perth CBD and the confluence of the Swan and Canning Rivers.But there's a lot else to do in King's Park, even just in the tourist precinct. You can wander through the sizable Botanic Gardens (including the Lotterywest Federation Walkway), have a picnic or just sit on one of the many lovely grassy spaces, have lunch at the restaurant or cafe, browse the gift shop (which isn't full of cheap rubbish like many gift shops, but accordingly isn't cheap. I bought a nice scarf.)The State War Memorial was really well done in my opinion - sometimes I find these things a bit much. There are a lot of other interesting statues and memorials around too, for example a monument to firefighters and a monument to Edith Cowan, who was the first woman to be a member of an Australian parliament.You can also climb up the DNA Tower, which offers a higher vantage point. In my opinion the views from Fraser Avenue are actually nicer, but it is a different perspective an I don't regret having done it. You can also go for a bushwalk (most of the park is actually bushland) and for families there are various children's play areas and BBQ areas. I also stopped in at the visitor information centre - the volunteers were so helpful and friendly. We had a long chat and then they gave me a map and showed me a good route through the garden. If you were working there in the afternoon on the 13th of December, thank you! As it was a hot day they were also providing free sunscreen here.I had a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon at King's Park!"
190,Large and nice park ,I was told if you ever get the chance when in Perth. Do your self a favour and take a stroll around Kings Park just before sunrise. I wasn't disappointed absolutely stunning views and the gardens and lawns were fantastic. The walk was exactly a great way to start the day. It's a 10 out of 10. I didn't get a chance to sample coffee from one of the cafes. I will definitely do it again. Well done Perth.
191,Fantastic collection of Western Australian plants,"Worth visiting if only for the views over Perth and the Swan River. As well as the Botanic Garden you can also see the State War Memorial. The gardens and Kings Park feature several walks which take you through a variety of landscapes where you can see examples of plants native to Western Australia, some of which are endangered. Kings Park also features a large bush area and walking through here is quite scary when you think of the recent bushfires the country has experienced. There are also a couple of eating venues, a shop and information centre at hand."
192,A walk in the Park,"We have travelled to Western Australia for 12 years visiting our family and one of our favourite places is Kings Park in Perth. The entrance itself is famous for the tree lined avenue honouring lost soldiers, it is a remarkable sentiment to those heroes. On entering the park the walk down to the war memorial just takes our breath away every time with the amazing view over the city and Swan River, go there you will be smitten as we were."
193,Fab place to visit ,"The park is very big. To get a good view of the city, we need to enter from the city entry. In the centre of the green walk, next to playground, there could be outdoor movies in weekend evenings."
194,Great morning wandering the garden paths,"Free to visit,free city CAT bus and full of fun activities for literally everyone! From young to old. From the mant children's play areas to the war memorial to the stunning Instagram worthy day and night views of Perth city, this is definately worth a visit."
195,Walk and coffee ,"Overlooking the city, this garden has several focus areas such as the water garden, banksia, and more. Even for non plant lovers, the garden is worth the city views. Lots of paths and options for access."
196,Amazing views of the top of Perth,"A very pleasant garden, plants were labeled, well maintained. The War Memorial was another highlight."
197,A must visit when in Perth!,A super park with stunning views over Perth. Well worth the walk up the hill from the city. The botanic and remembrance gardens are excellent.
198,Beautiful botanical garden,so refreshing walking around this park. the park is really big that it needs 3 hours to walk around and still not finished yet
199,Fantastic place for a walk with great city views and sobering war memorial,My wife and I had a lovely day there with some friends picnic lunch and a glass of wine overlooking the river and city just perfect
200,3  meals at this restaurant,"Kings park has to be the no. 1 botanical gardens in austraia because of its strategic location which you wont find anywhere else in Australia. What amazed me it was the great scenic view looking into the swan river, aboustely breath taking !"
201,LOVELY PLACE TO VISIT,"Take the free tour from the information centre-run by volunteers who “make” the park experience so special. The view over the city, where 2 rivers meet ( The Swan and the Canning)is stunning. The floral display is well maintained. You can drive through the park and explore its diverse landscapes. Bigger then Central Park."
202,"City view, hiking, outdoor movies",Well maintained lawns. Plenty of parkland with gazebos and free BBQs. Food kiosks near the war memorial. Great view overlooking the city.
203,Gorgeous and relaxing!,Fabulous park and gardens with stunning views over Perth. Stunning avenues of eucalyptus trees and beautiful walks. Don't miss it if you ever visit.
204,How lucky are we West Australians! ,Have visited several times and still find a brilliant location.The War memorial is not to missed a sobering place .
205,"Iconic landmark in Perth, Western Australia",Beautiful place to visit for all ages. Plenty of parking and a whole host of walking paths both short and long. The views of Perth and the river were lovely. The glass bridge was a pretty cool gimmick as well. Enough shade to walk around even on very hot days. The restaurant was surprisingly very good for a park cafe. It was big and had big tables to cater for large families. The food was very good and the coffee was excellent. There is an ice cream bar as well.
206,Walks + Views,This is a brilliant place to walk and walk and walk. so many different areas to see and all well looked after. Take a picnic or visit the cafes on site. It's a very relaxing place even on a very hot day.  Wheelchair friendly for most of it. also great views and little bits of history. They do a great job here in preserving the indigenous plant species.
207,Night view,"Nice park, with a lot to see and a great place for walking. In addition, there are spots with splendid views over Perth."
208,Wear good shoes,This park is massive. We visited using the CAT transport system and came in through a side entrance so it took a little time to find the visitors facilities. However once found the park is well set up for visitors both local and overseas. The volunteer guides are knowledgeable and helpful in explaining how things work. The bush trails are extensive but on the day we visited it was too hot to attempt them. The Botanical Gardens offered interest and shade. The formal gardens around the war memorials are well kept and sensitively done. The views of the city as you walk through the park are superb. There are food outlets in the park and the food coming out was good. More importantly for us there was ice and unlimited cold water.
209,Beautiful park with great views,"nature walks, beautiful grassed areas, views over looking the Swan River and the city, views over looking south Perth  to the hills lovely Botanical gardens a must see."
210,Park walks,It is increadibly beautiful. Full of native flora and fauna.  It is a nature reserve but has well maintained gardens and lawn areas for picnic and other activities.  Has a couple of cafe and restaurants where you can enjoy the view of the city and Swan river while you are enjoying you meal.
211,Walking trails,A fantastic multi faceted park with plenty of room to move. Amazing flora and fauna. Lots of things for the kids to do.
212,Great views and gardens,Well worth a visit! Take a picnic and enjoy the view. War memorials very well done. Great shop with lots of unusual items.
213,little forrest amidst of the City,"Visitd after site seeeing in Perth.  Nice walk and very nice.  Forget the resturant, poor service,  Resturant was dirty which is odd from all the other places we visited."
214,Wow what a view!!!,The park is vast with a whole range of vistas and something to offer for everyone - and it’s completely free. Extremely well maintained and the views over the Swan River are stunning. A place to sit and appreciate the world.
215,Unbelievable views,Enormous gardens and open spaces with a spectacular view of Perth. Highlighting the plants of various regions of WA ang great spaces for kids to play.
216,Great views of Perth and swan River,"Taking the free tour around the botanic section was brilliant. The guide was so informative and engaging, we were all engrossed by the flora, fauna and aboriginal history of the park. Well recommended."
217,My favorite place in oz,It was very hot but well worth a long walk around this quite beautiful garden.We did the high tree walk which was interesting and I had never see a memorial to the Jewish fraternity who had lost their lives in the world wars - so that was just so moving and lovely.We could have spent much longer here but we were too hot but if we were ever again in Perth we would revisit. Thank you Botanic Gardens
218,Lovely views and interesting memorials,"If there is any place to go to in Perth, this should be at the top of your list. Great day out with stunning views overlooking the Swan River and city."
219,BEST VIEWS OF PERTH CITY,Love than the Aussies do so much with their public space. Well maintained and interesting informative signage
220,Great afternoon out...,"If you had just 2 or 3 hours transiting Perth, then a visit to Kings Park would be the “top of a list” activity. From Mt Eliza you will view the lay of the land from Perth Hills to the East  right around and across the Swan Coastal Plain West towards the ocean, with the wide estuarine Swan River linking all between almost at your feet. Kings Park captures the Australian bush both naturally and botanically with walk trails, The  WA Botanuc  Garden, family picnic and playgrounds appearing in random bush clearings featuring kid friendly water features, with  BBQ facilities and sun sheltering pavilions etcYou’ll learn a little WA  history viewing a number of commemorative monuments including the State War Memorials and the avenues of trees; each tree a dedicated memorial to a particular fallen soldier. But there are several pleasant cafes and a very nice restaurant to quell any hints of hunger after walking or cycling the trails and if you visit on a Summers evening you may catch a movie at the starlight cinema or enjoy live concerts from touring artists , sometimes playing in company of The WA Symphony Orchestra. Kings Park is great place to gain a little feel for what makes Perth one of the most liveable cities in the world; and it’s open and free to visit 24/7."
221,Beautiful spaces,Excellant views of perth city. All the grounds have details of all the plant life and its history. War memorial very moving. Maybe not ideal for kids to walk around but enty of areas to sit and have a picnic
222,Reliably excellent,"Something to do for everyone, well kept and beautiful views over the city of Perth and the Swan River."
223,The largest Park,What a beautiful view of the city. We stayed there for long and night view was even more stunning! A place must visit
224,A great place to show your visitors,This was a very impressive park and the trees in memory of the soldiers killed so long ago in the war that now stand majestically tall and straight is awe inspiring.  What a fabulous plan that has been maintained over the decades and still in place in such a booming city.  Well worth the visit with the pristine grounds and the fantastic views of such a growing bustling city. Impressive.
225,Wonderful urban park ,This is a must to visit while in Perth very iconic place. This time of the year is just beautiful and the right time to explore the best place in Perth.
226,A Beautiful park so close to the city,"No visit to Perth is complete without a visit to Kings Park.Whilst hugely popular in the daytime as residents and visitors come to enjoy the park and the botanic gardens (and the occasional concert they hold here), and get panoramic views of the city, South Perth and the Swan River meandering from the south to the east, it’s particularly spectacular at night time when you can see the city all lit up. Surprisingly, it gets busier at night than it does in the day, although that could be because everyone is concentrated in one area at night (on the eastern side of the park), whilst they are more spread out during the daytime. It’s free to visit, and a lovely way to spend a couple of hours."
227,Heaps to see,"This enormous park provides a place to view the city of Perth. As well, the park is surrounded by natural bushland. This gives the visitor, with little time, to get an indication of what the outskirts of the city looks like. The park proudly boosts many local species of Australian plants. There is a cafe, restaurant and gift shop in the main part of the park."
228,A must do,"Unfortunately, we had no a lot of time to walk there. But we got a lot of pleasure. There is a very nice viewpoint with picturesque view on the city. There are some cosy place to relax."
229,Leisure walk to enjoy gorgeous summer day,Lots of lovely walks and beautifully manicured grass areas. Treetop walkway is well worth the walk. Great views from various vantage points of Perth
230,A botanical delight!,There was so much to see with good paths to walk on. There were great views from many area's of the park. The glass bridge was great and had fantastic views of the old swan brewery and Perth city. I liked reading the informative signs about the different areas and gardens throughout the park. There were plenty of shady areas and seats along the pathways to have a rest or just sit and enjoy the surrounds. The Aspect of Kings Park Gallery shop has lots of locally made products and giftware for sale. I went to the cafe next door to the shop and had a cappuccino and scone with fresh cream and jam which was delicious. It would be a great place to go for the day and take a picnic.
231,Amazing highlight of any trip to Perth,"I can now believe it is the largest city park in the world! Great views ,plenty of parking and so many interesting things to view. Do not miss the Boab tree and read  its journey to get to the park ,understand why John Forrest is so highly regarded in WA. So easy to get there ,bus, drive or walk from the city"
232,Absolutely worth visiting!,We climbed up to this stunning park from our hotel in the city and we are so glad we did. It has terrific views and is a stunning place for anybody of any age to enjoy. There are many walks and views. Lots of plants to enjoy. Our favourite experience from Perth.
233,Kings Park and Botanic Garden,Got to go. Great views and atmosphere. Pleasant staff. Great to wander at your own pace through miles of well kept and clean gardens.
234,Perth Best Tourist Attraction (and Don't Miss It!),An outstanding natural park area with amazing views of Perth City. A must see for people of all ages!
235,Lots to see and do.,"There is so much to see at Kings Park including the stunning view out over Perth and the Swan River. We enjoyed climbing up the DNA Tower, seeing the native plants as you walk through the Park, spending time at the State War Memorial and looking at the amazing items for sale in Aspects, the gift shop. It is definitely a place to visit and enjoy in Perth."
236,"Great family day out, top botanical gardens in Australia","Had not been here for over 20 years and wow has it changed. Gone are the rambling bushy tracks that you had to fight through and avoid cyclists as well. Now it is very modernised with footpaths ,toilet blocks,cafes and auditoriums. The views across the river to the city are fabulous and if you want to take a picnic lunch and a bottle of wine and spend a lazy afternoon,then this is the place. The flora is abundant however depending on the time of year you go,this will differ,so check out the best times. The huge boab tree that was transported to site from outback many years ago is still hanging in there although you can see where it has struggled. Banksias, wattles,eromoflia and bottlebrushes are abundant. Get there early and enjoy the day in the park. One of Perths great spots to visit."
237,beautiful ,"This is in the free transport area so you can access it using the transport buses.It is A large park with free botanical garden, war memorials and walks.Take a inconvenience a good relaxing day out"
238,Beautiful views over Perth,Returned hear after 30 years and even better than I remembered. Definitely worth a visit .Amazing views of the city and swan river.
239,Beautiful ,"Got to be my fav place in Perth,Gardens allways well tended,lawns well trimmed,and what a view of the city skyline.Take 935 bus from CBD. or walk up"
240,Gorgeous Park,"The view itself, night or day, is perfect.  Has been many years since last visit and Kings Park has so much to offer.  Due to limited time,  unable to explore as much as wanted,  but when able to, will definitely return. Will do one of the indigenous tours on offer. Also,  so many park areas to explore. Always love how the plants have informative signs on them.Spent time at the impressive War Memorial. Respectfully done with the Eternal Flame very popular with photographers."
241,Great spot for a relaxing picnic,A well maintained site and a pleasure to spend many hours there. The thought out decision to plant a first world world war soldiers plaque under every tree is a great reminder of the sacrifice made by so many young men to give us the freedom we have today. The authorities and staff need to be congratulated by the love and care shown on this vast expanse in the centre of the city.
242,This has to be THE Reason for a Visit to Perth WA,"A short drive or bus ride to this magnificent park will add to your Perth WA experience. Expansive views over the city scape and Swan River, great public amenities including gallery with Australiana, art, mementos and items for you to remember your visit by. Cafe's, amazing native gardens and wildflower displays in season. Many lawn areas for picnicking, fallen soldier & war memorial, so many great spaces to visit & so close to the city."
243,Botanic garden,"Although the park overlooks parts of Perth, and traffic is visible from the park's edges, take a few steps away from the edge and the tranquillity is palpable. A slow stroll around the green grass moves you past locality-themed gardens, well-equipped with explanatory plaques and notices. Hot day? Plenty of trees to provide shelter."
244,MUST SEE VISIT IF IN PERTH,Great gardens presented magnificently. Central is the National memorial which is very moving. Off to one side is the Kodoaka trail memorial to events in WW 2 in PNG. Having clime / crawled that trail I am awestruck that the 16th Bn got guns up there.The botanic gardens are superb and the walk is a must.
245,a 'must see' feature of Perth,"KINGS PARKKings Park was a very interesting park. It was an eye opener.  Its local maps of the site and surrounding points of interest was a joy to behold.Seeing the City, the expressway and trains from Kings Park was a delight. It was great to see the landscape of Perth over a larger scale. Kings Park is ideally suited for walks and visiting the various venues within the Park environment was also an enjoyable experience. Congratulations to the many people over many years who have made Kings Park what it is today. Brilliant landscaping of the various plants and trees. Well done."
246,Best Park ever ,"Without doubt, a must see attraction in Perth. I was blown away by the views, the beauty and peace of the gardens. A wonderful glass walkway through the trees and the backdrop of the Perth skyline was one of the best views in Perth. There’s a cafe and restaurant here and plenty of parking. The Anzac memorial and whispering wall are not to be missed."
247,Great anytime of the year,This was one of the highlights of our visit to Perth. Beautiful and extensive parklands. Excellent view of the Swan River and surrounds. The botanical gardens show all the plants of the native Australian bush. The highlight of the park is the suspension bridge.
248,Lovely Park With Beautiful Views Of Perth,"We had day out at Kings Park on our recent stay in Perth, the park is very well laid out and well worth a visit. The free tour which we did was excellent, Hamish gave us a great insight into the different sections of the park and was great with the kids keeping them engaged and interested. In fact our daughter spent the remaining few weeks of our trip in WA identifying plants that she had learned about on the tour."
249,welltravelled2019,The park is located very close to the city and offers fantastic views over Perth City and the Swan River.
250,A haven of peace plus good facilities,"Kings Park set in as a beautiful backdrop to the city.  Lots of walks, gardens and views of Perth and surrounds.  Restaurants, cafe's, shops and childrens playground abound."
251,Beautiful Park,"Overlooking Perth and the Swan river this is a beautiful place with so much to offer.  The free bus will carry you from the centre of town to Kings Park and a short walk finds you at the entrance of the Botanic Garden.  The gardens are so varied and have areas to picnic, sit and enjoy or walk.  There are attractions such as the DNA Tower, the Federation Walkway and more. Highly recommended."
252,Spectacular - largest public park in the world,Visited multiple times and always stunning should be on anyone’s to do list when visiting Perth! Lucky to have this in our state!
253,Good view of Perth and artistic gift shop,Great variety of wildlife near the Perth CBD. Great facilities including BBQs and gazebos for gatherings and other events.
254,As lovely as I remembered it in 2010,"My image of Kings park was of a standard and traditional park space...I was totally wrong! The park itself is huge and incorporates a native Australian botanical garden...the views from the park of both the city and the sea were superb, and it was an excellent place to go for a walk in order to de-stress. I especially enjpyed the tree top walk which was a bridge built above the tree line. Many families go there and have picnics on the open grounds, which creates a safe and inviting environment..highly recommended!"
255,Pictures do not do it justice ,"This was a really nice side trip tour, before sailing out on our second of two back to back cruises, this one from Fremantle.  The park is very scenic, with great city views of Perth and the surrounding waterway.  The Botanical garden was really nice, with a lot of winding walking paths. And, there was a very moving war memorial, where yearly ceremonies are held. All in all, this visit was well worth it."
256,Natural Beauty,What a great experience we had when we visited Kings  Park as part of the Red Bus hop on hop off tour.  It is a huge park with lots of variety and interesting trees  and plants and I think anyone who visits  Perth should definitely go to this very beautiful park
257,Place of peace,"Would recommend a trip here to anyone visiting Perth. We took an Uber there which was less than $10 from CBD, but you can catch a bus or walk. We went on a Sunday and it was lovely to see so many locals enjoying the park. We started at the WA state war memorial before taking a walk through the botanical gardens. Great views of the city from here, reasonably priced cafe serving food and drinks and a gift shop with a wide variety of australian products."
258,So much to do,Highly recommend coming to the gardens as one of your first stops. We came here after our 6hr flight from Brisbane and it was a lovely introduction to Perth as you can see the city from the top and also visit the memorial. There are kids playgrounds throughout the gardens and are just so well thought out. Bring a picnic and just relax here.
259,A must place to visit,"We walked 30mins from Perth CBD area to the park via Elizabeth Quay. Interesting boards around the park to tell us Australia's part of story during WWII. We took the Kokoda Track, went up the 'Golden Stairway' and reach the State war memorial where there stands war memorials to commemorate different groups of people who sacrifice during the war. There's also a cafe up there for you to chill out. We had a bird eyes view of Perth City from up there as well as Swan River. It's a place where you can bring your pet for a walk, take a picnic mat, lie down under a shade to just relax. It's good for people residing in Perth itself as its the biggest city park in the world, an escape from infrastructures everywhere. However, if you are a tourist, its just another park with trees and unique flowers. There are more interesting places and more acitivities to do just a little drive outskirts."
260,Hot n sunny day,I had the most wonderful day here enjoying the views and sitting at the restaurant having a lovely meal and being treated so well by the staff.
261,Very scenic,"Kings Park and Botanic Gardens offer a world class experience.  Nowhere will you enjoy such a magnificent, proud and informative visit.  From the cafes, to the shop,  restaurant, magnificent scenery, amazingly presented zoned plantings, playgrounds.......It's to die for! Oh, to be a tree in that Park! An absolute must visit."
262,Best views of Perth - huge parklands!,"This is a massive park but does require a reasonably steep walk for access from the city.The avenue of honour of trees is quite something.The main tourist facilities did seem a bit tired but the park for a walk,run or ride was pretty nice"
263,You can forget the city bustle here,"I have lived in Perth for many years and had never truly and properly visited Kings Park until I had a friend staying with me from Melbourne. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the park and gardens, moved by the war memorial and loved the best view of Perth city. I will definitely go back again and it is definitely on my list of things to do for visitors to Perth now."
264,Most beautiful public park ever,Have lived in Perth for over 10 years an have attended the park many times beautiful surroundings views and many areas to sit a compelling day
265,A MUST DO for any visit to Perth,"An asset to the city, well located and maintained. Plenty of space to escape within. Great range of plants and facilities."
266,Stunning,"If you’re visiting Perth, then Kings Park at sunset should definitely be on your must do list. The view is spectacular, there is ample parking and the gardens are lovely. Next time we will bring a blanket and have a picnic."
267,The Highlight of Perth,"Kings Park is easily accessable from the City. Most of it is still bushland, although some areas commemorate the Fallen Soldiers of WA and Pioneer Women, amongst other things. The most attractive area is the Botanic Garden, which has plants from all over Western Australia (WA). WA has many clmiatic zones, from Temperate in the extreme south to Tropical in the North. Unfortunately, I'm told the massive Boab Tree died from overwatering. Most places within Kings Park are within walking distance. Points of interest include the memorial to the 10th Light Horse and the memorial to Jewish servicemen."
268,Visit to Kings Park,Once we had found the Botanic Garden and obtained a map from the visitor centre we thoroughly enjoyed our walk through the garden and the tree top walk.  There are fantastic views over the city.
269,Kings Park,"Just a short walk from the centre of the city. Mostly shaded  walking, great views of Perth plus the War Memorial...so tranqil and peaceful"
270,Visiting Kings Park,"Its beautifully laid out signposted, maintained and plants labelled. Wheelchair accessible for the most part. Good cafe but WiFi there hard to access."
271,Spectacular View,"What a delight, just on a heavy 30 minutes walk from Perth CBD. I took Mount streef, which was pretty hard on the calves... Up there there are several wonderful views, a very good information center and all kinds of walks to do. Very good information boards about indigenous and western history. So many beautiful plants and well maintained vegetation!Also recommended: lunch near Visitors Center. Pretty view from there!"
272,Display of Western Australia Flora ,Easy to get to from the city's Central Business District the Park offers great views of the Swan River.  Great place to stop for lunch or refreshment. The botanical gardens provide excellent descriptors and examples of plants native to Western Australia.
273,This is a wow trip,"Perth is an amazingly well-kept and manicured city and Kings Park was no different. Great paths for all abilities and wonderful views across to the city. Very nice gallery/shop showcasing local and more general Australian talent was also nice to spend some time in. Everyone encountered was lovely and friendly and the cafe does a pretty good coffee to boot. Definitely a nice place to spend some time in, whether it's a couple of hours before a flight or a whole day with bringing a picnic and games on the lawns. Simply lovely place to enjoy some of that famous Perth weather."
274,Stunning Views,"Bit of a hidden gem, views are spectacular and the variety of different spaces means there’s something for everyone, great events all year around and an outdoor cinema!"
275,beautiful views,"Within walking distance of Perth CBD, great views of the city by day or by night. Lots of walk trails, native plants and playgrounds for the children. Cafes and a restaurant available. A great place for a picnic and some relaxation."
276,A must visit,"Amazing views of the top of Perth, very clean environment also, nice rest rooms, decent amount of parking available also."
277,Must visit ,This is a must see destination and I don't think there is any need for expand on it.  You will not be disappointed.
278,Perfect way to spend a day!,"We had a lovely morning here. We are in the main restaurant which was surprisingly inexpensive considering they have a captive audience. The water station in the restaurant is free to use. Clean toilets. Beautifully kept grounds. The war memorial is also beautifully maintained and there is a real feeling of the care and respect that went into the design and upkeep. Lovely walk over the Lottery Bridge. Lots of information to read about the plants etc, very educational. Easily accessible on the bus which is free fro the city centre. Great views over Perth. Well worth a visit."
279,Wheelchair suitable paths,"How lucky are we to have the beautiful Kings Park right in our midst.So close, but yet a perfect, peaceful haven to get away from the crowds. Love this space, a must do for Perth visitors."
280,Beautiful Botanical Gardens and the moving War Memorial,Kings Park  is a gem  easy to access on a free bus 935 from CBD.Beautifully maintained grounds giving great views across the city and the confluence of the Canning and Swan Rivers. The botanical gardens are a delight  with native WA plants showcased throughout as well as  the lovely parrots  swooping around in great mobs.  You can walk for miles or If you wish you can just lie in the shade and take a nap perfect !
281,Spectacular Views ,"Apart from the view over all of Perth, Kings Park is worth a visit for its tranquility and its variety of native trees, shrubs and flowers. It is a wonderful place to just wander and contemplate, with vast areas of well kept lawns for you to actually sit on ! It really is one of the jewels in Perth's crown."
282,Amazing Location,Fantastic location with view over Perth City and Swan River. Very good service and exccellent Food. Had lamb and Fish and fantastic icecream
283,Beautiful enviroment,Without doubt a most spectacular location with views over Perth & Swan River not to mention very fitting location for war memorial & eternal flame. Botanic Gardens are a delight to walk through & there is also a sky walk. Plenty to enjoy.
284,Nice walk – beautiful birds,"Kings Park is aptly named as it is truly in a majestic setting overlooking the mighty Swan River and the quay and CBD of Perth WA.  With stunning views of the city and river, the park is home to the Botanic Gardens which displays and protects both native and endangered species of plant life.  Take a gentle walk though the gardens and follow the paths, taking note not to walk on the forbidden parts. Over the Glass Bridge which gives you a great view of the river, take a moment to look the other way into the canopy of the trees behind and you can see a wonder of foliage.  A must see on your visit to Perth."
285,Kings Park,"Beautiful place to take the children, great play areas suitable for different age kids, well maintained grass area clean and toilet facilities well maintained"
286,A must when visiting Perth,"Kings Park is an amazing green space in the city of Perth. It is easily accessible by public transport as well as car. The park is mostly natural with many trails for walking and jogging. In the botanical section, there is a huge range of Australian wildflowers. In season, the wild flowers are all in bloom and a sight to see. The wild flower collection is from different parts of the country. In the area near the botanical garden, there are refreshment facilities as well as a gift shop. In another part of the park there is a great children’s play area. As a bonus, one often sees all kinds of birds. In the last few years, black parrots have visited the park."
287,Very well maintained ,"A lovely place to spend a couple of hours away from the hustle and bustle of the city,i was particularly taken by the Memorial Garden area and spending some time reading the many names and regiments that are honoured here,it really does make you realise that the wars we know of in recent history were not solely won by the British and Americans as is often depicted.Total respect to the Australian authorities for this memorial,the people honoured here have my full gratitude.The views overlooking Perth are amazing too,so a very worthwhile visit and one that will certainly stick in my memory."
288,This is what parks should look like,"Kings Park and Botanic Garden is fabulous... really well laid out,clean and very inspirational.. loved our visit there!"
289,A must-do Perth experience,"Right from the start driving in to Kings Park with the tree lined road was beautiful then you see the view which is breathtaking. We spent the day wondering and exploring, the kids even made comments of how beautiful it was throughout the time we were there. Well worth a visit."
290,Beautiful,Fabulous day visiting a beautiful park and memorial to those who lost their lives in WW1&WW2. Walk over the glass bridge amongst trees a spectacular view over Perth.
291,Lovely park with stunning views over the river,"For near central city, Kings Park is indeed something of a world apart. With its elevated position above the city, the views are exceptional. The park itself is open & sprawling. We did walk round most of it & it was relaxing, although a little breezy. It has good paths so wheelchairs/pushchairs are not a problem. All the gardens were well kept. The tree walk section was the highlight for me. The park has fountains, statues, cafes & plenty of seating. Even the grass was in good order, so picnics are possible."
292,Favourite Perth Park,"A magnificent park, provide splendid panoramic view of the Perth City. Impeccable manicured park greenery worth every second dwell on park with many historical monuments"
293,A good day out,"Kings Park sitting over the CBD of Perth provides a green oasis with million dollar views of Perth and the Swan River..The Park houses the beautiful State War Memorial and Botanical gardens. The gardens are big , well laid out and a testament to the flora of Western Australia.It's easy to bring a picnic lunch and hide yourself away for hours. Easy to get to and a wonderful day out."
294,Beautiful park,What should be an icon in the midst of a state treasure was an absolute shambles.  We ordered a meal which was cold and overcooked. The glasses and cutlery were filthy - hadn’t been cleaned properly and even had lipstick marks on them. We ordered pots of tea which came 20 minutes after our meal and were not what we ordered. We left disappointed and broke after being charged a fortune for basic food. Ruined a great grandmothers birthday celebration.
295,Nice Park ,"King's Park is an area  of untouched bushland on the edge of Perth, making it unique in Australia. There is lots of space to wander in. It has a number of features, including the State War Memorial and the Pioneer Women's Memorial . You can get a marvellous view of the City of Perth from the park. The Botatnic Garden is worth seeing, it hs a lot of native Western Australian (WA) flora.. Except for the extreme South West, WA is a dry State and there are interesting plants from the Wheatbelf and other semi-arid areas."
296,Kings Park,"Kings Park is one of the largest inner parks in the world. It is located in the center of Perth and occupies 4.000.000 square meters. More than 6.000 visitors go to enjoy the park every year. The amount of greenery all around the park seems to work as the lungs of the city and it is truly amazing to see. I felt like I was in a forest and felt small looking at the baobab tree, a tree from the Kimberley region that is 760 years old. Kings Park is home to Western Australia’s State Botanic Garden, which has over 3,000 species of flora. I also went on the spiraling DNA Tower and after feeling exhausted from the 101 steps, I have to say the view was more than rewarding! I couldn’t leave without visiting the famous Botanic Garden. Among all the amazing species of flora, 326 species are native ones. There are also over 70 bird species! If you walk on the Lotterywest Federation Walkway, you will probably see a lot of different species of birds. You go through a treetop and birds are nesting all around and flying over people’s heads."
297,Kings Park & Botanical Gardens,We came here twice over a stay of only a few hours following a long direct flight from London. So it was now tailing off for Summer but there were still some delightful flowers to see and the aerial walkway  was a treat. Definitely worth a visit.
298,Views and gardens,Oh my gosh. I had been told by many people to go here and it did not disappoint. Unfortunately we only had a short time here and would love to come back and explore some more. Just amazing
299,Wonderful ,"Wondrous. Beautifully set out, beautifully maintained, imaginatively thought through and the most effective memorial to a lost generation. It has not stood still. The nature walk although modern is as well laid out and thoughtful. The gallery and restaurant the same. West Australians do not know how lucky they are.  A must for every visitor and returnee. We go there every time we go to Perth and it is always just as good."
