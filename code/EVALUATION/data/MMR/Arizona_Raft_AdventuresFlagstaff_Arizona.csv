0,Upper canyon Bucket list trip ,"More than I could’ve imaginedThe guides were extremely helpful, fun and so knowledgeable Everyday was a new adventure Hiking, rafting and just hanging out Guides were always concerned for our safety and very encouraging and helpful for our 8 mile hike outAnd the food!!! Better than any camping trip I’ve been onChef quality menus And lots of itStaff was very good about the new covid cleaning/mask routines Never felt unsafeWould definitely recommend"
1,A Trip of a Lifetime,"Was the most fantastic trip of my life. The guides were superb-safe, fun, incredibly helpful. Food was great. One of the best things I have ever done for myself.Impossible to explain the life changing, heart-opening experience of a life time. Do it! and I think AZRA is the best company when it comes to safety, understanding the geology of the canyon and really going the extra mile.Went oct 22 to nov 6th. Best weather they had ever had late in the season. i loved avoiding the 110-120 degree summer days. Weather was great for hiking. Cold at night but i just put on a hat and gloves and snuggled down into my bag."
2,Hands down one of the best experiences of my life   Full canyon motorized raft,"Fantastic people run this amazing adventure.   I had never done anything like this and it far surpassed my expectations.    Adventure and enjoyment absolutely everywhere.  We ranted, hiked, explored and the food was supreme."
3,Upper Canyon Trip August 2020,"This trip was beyond amazing, exceeding our expectations in almost every way. The guides were amazing and knowledgeable, the food was great, the logistics extremely well executed. And of course the Grand Canyon is well worthy of its status as one of the seven wonders of the world. The only question to ask yourself is about how much hiking you want to do. On the 8 day trip, there is only limited time and the hikes are relatively short. I understand that the 10 day trip allows for more time to explore the canyon better on foot, which is a great perspective to add to the view from the river. AZRA did a TOP notch job from beginning to end."
4,Revitalization & renewal in an isolated pandemic bubble for my paddling family & friends,"The trip was fantastic.  Scenery unbelievable.  Guides were all very knowledgeable and capable and phenomenally hard-working.  Meals were first-rate and really hard to imagine that one could eat so well so many days into a trip.  They even created a special private dining area (complete with candle lights) for my wife and I on our 25th Anniversary which was Day 6 of the trip.Be aware though, this trip is not for the faint of heart.  The hike down Bright Angel Trail is a beast and you want to make sure you have given yourself the gift of training for it.  Every day you are up early breaking camp and setting up camp after a long day of rafting or hiking.  The silt is everywhere and though you get used to it, the chocolate colored river in the summer is a shock.  Bring clothes that you do not mind being trashed in the end.  Be prepared for all kinds of weather.  And be prepared for adventure.  It is a wondrous trip, and having the paddle boat as part of the trip was a real treat - you get to actually be a participant in the journey in the paddle boat, you are not just along for the ride."
5,Voluntary Social Distancing in the Grand Canyon,"Absolutely amazing experience with a great company employing stellar guides. Full days on the river and/or doing amazing side hikes (tailored to individual abilities of various group members) were always bookended with great breakfasts, nutritious hearty lunches, and amazing dinners. Really, it was crazy what they could pull off 13 days into a trip without a grocery store in sight. Really diverse guides allowed you to get a big workout in, chill and watch the Grand scenery go by, and/or really learn something about the history, legends, and geology of the place. Their preparation booklet is spot-on too, read it carefully. Go with this company."
6,Perfection in the Grand Canyon,"Awesome from start to finish!  Obviously the surroundings, but also excellent organization by the company and guides, entertaining and knowledgable commentary re history of exploration and geology of the canyon, outstanding food, exciting rapids, hikes up side canyons to idyllic pools and grottos, etc, etc, etc.  I felt I had been well prepared for the adventure by AzRA, thanks to  pre-trip information and gear lists they provided via their website, phone calls and emails answering all my questions, and an orientation meeting the evening before we put in at Lee's Ferry."
7,7 day upper Grand Canyon,"This was an amazing trip with a super professional group. It was, as many promised, a life changing experience. I wish I was back on the river right now!"
8,IF Grand Canyon THEN Arizona Raft Adventures,"Randy, Katie, and Somer are fabulous AZRA guides!  They all provided a safe and FUN adventure on the river. The food is fabulous and the friendship is even better!"
9,Great experience ,"Great guides, food, experience. I'd go again next week. Exciting, informative and a relaxed good time with friends without the intrusion of technology. Food was WAY beyond expectations when space, weight, etc. are considered for a 2 week excursion with no resupply."
10,Best Family Vacation ~ July 2019,"What an incredibly wonderful experience!  The guides are professional, extremely knowledgeable and care deeply that each person regardless of ability have an excellent time.  I expected that I would love the white water part which I did but also fell in love with the hiking.  Challenging - yes but to see the the beautiful canyons and their waterfalls well worth the effort.  Thank you AZRA for helping this novice enjoy the trip so deeply!"
11,If you missed out on the Zimbardo prison study...,"Our guides were incredible! They put on a fun and action packed trip and worked very hard to accomodate our requests. I typically don't like being guided anywhere but since most people in my group know nothing about rafting we decided to go on a guided trip. I have to say that I was skeptical at first but within the first few days, AZRA already had me enjoying myself and forgetting my skepticism. Many thanks to Kevin, Wade, Alan, Kelly, and Dirk for putting on the show."
12,Amazing! Loved our trip!,"Everything that can be said about how the Grand Canyon exceeds all expectations and how totally awesome fun the white water of the Colorado River leaves  you smiling, wet, and breathless, has already be said. All the good lines have been taken. But the rest of the trip was all about AZRA and our guides Jed and Somer. We were 14 in a group of family and friends invited to join the trip by our good friend Don Redfearn. The total care, great meals, unerringly cheerful, companionable willingness on the guide's part to ensure that everyone was well fed, looked after, entertained, and enjoying themselves was above and beyond our expectations. This was much more than a white water raft ride down killer scenery. It was a history lesson, a geology lesson, an awareness of our fragile ecology lesson, a social team building experiment in helping each other endure both the hardships and the joys of eight days in tough temperatures, and sand in every possible place you can imagine; it became a journey unto itself, facilitated with great generosity, from beginning to end, by our charismatic guides. If you didn't come away from this having been changed for the better, well, you just were not paying attention. Everyone should do this once in their lives. Really. You can do this at any age. Two of our group were octogenarians. And several of us in late 50's to 60's. We ALL had a great time. My only advice....Read and follow all the material AZRA provides for what you need to do to prepare, what gear to bring, how to take care of yourself on the river. It will make all the difference in how you enjoy yourself. And, one other thing....make sure you bring along an Irishman. Ours was MOST entertaining."
13,The experience of a lifetime. AZRA IS THE BEST,"Could not have asked for more. Everything  was professional and fun from the staff and website info as I got ready, to the care, education, food and support from the guides while in the Canyon. The passion and skill of the Azra guides are perfect for this special place. Thank you to my friends on this trip and to our guides who made this experience so wonderful."
14,"Not for everybody, but if you are up to it, this is the trip of a lifetime!!!","I cannot say enough wonderful things about our recent 16 day Classic adventure with AzRA. The guides, the equipment, the food and professionalism of this company are top notch. We have done several other guided trips in different locations of the world and these folks rank at the top. Bravo AzRA! Of course, the Grand Canyon itself is the star of this adventure. Truly a ""wonder of the world"". Every turn revealed another breathtaking view. Would highly recommend this trip to all fit individuals. It is challenging and stressful at times. You will grow in confidence as each day passes as you learn your capabilities. When its over, you will wish you had a few more days to experience the magic of this glorious place. Just do it!!"
15,Wow! What a special trip,"An amazing adventure in stunning country with constantly awe-inspiring vistas. A great balance between rafting down the spectacular canyon with a variety of rapid sizes and most days we also explored the surrounding slot canyons and ridges by foot and were fortunate enough to see a couple of mountain lion foot prints!  We loved sleeping under the stars almost every night which was very special.  The staff were incredible with a huge amount of experience, very knowledgable and entertaining - they all have their own unique specialty areas they are passionate about.  We were super impressed with the variety & quality of food that they manage to put together each day & we enjoyed fresh produce until the last day.  Thanks to a very special group of people who have a real connection to the great outdoors."
16,Experience of a lifetime!,"This exceeded all my expectations by a country mile! The guides especially Somer were a credit to any company by the standards they set. Enjoyment, education, expectations and most importantly safety for the whole party was first class :-) I travelled with my 23yr old daughter and her fiancé, my 23yr old son and my 46 yr old brother n law. i am 53yrs old and guides ensured that all our party was looked after be it walks, games, food and stories everything was was covered. Great holiday, great company and most of all, great memories...Thank you...Gordon x"
17,Awesome 10-day!,"The grand canyon is an extraordinary place in itself but AZRA's guides shared their love and knowledge of the canyon to create an adventure of a lifetime.  From delicious meals, hikes for all skill levels, to quiet time guitar in the most amazing of 'music halls', this trip was planned with amazing attention to detail that offered a full range of experiences to be present with all of the qualities of the canyon. Lots of laughter, excitement and stillness.  thank you AZRA. Do it - you'll never forget it!"
18,Grand Canyon rafting,"Our guides were fantastic and extremely knowledgeable about the history of the river. We were on 32 foot rafts, no paddling for 1 week. It was extremely hot in June but the river provided instantrelief. The hikes we did were the highlight for me. We hiked to other small rapids, waterfalls and into the canyons for some amazing views. Sleeping under a blanket of stars was also a highlight. The food our guides cooked was delicious, truly impressive. My 1 complaint was the buses we took to and from the river were very old with no AC."
19,Everything! ,Azra's organization and high-quality guides made the trip an experience of a lifetime.  I would highly recommend this service for your Grand Canyon adventure.
20,Can't name just one highlight,"The trip was the experience of a lifetime and well worth doing. AzRA organisation and staff were fantastic, with great pre-trip information on the website and through emails.  The River Guides were skilled, knowledgeable and delightful people who worked together as a team but as great boat women and men in their own right.  Food was fantastic and they catered to my vegetarian needs very well.  They adapted their style and daily schedule to the diverse needs of our group.  The walk in from the South Rim is an adventure in itself and our hiking guide similarly supported us.  Highly recommended and I would not change a thing."
21,Rafting trip of a lifetime.,"What an amazing adventure!  I just got back from a 14 day Classic Adventure Full Canyon trip.  Words and photos cannot do justice to the beauty and fun we had.  The AZRA guides where absolutely wonderful and provided an insane amount of geological and historical knowledge about the GC and the area (we had geologists on our trip with us so they couldn't get away with wrong facts!). They made sure that every guest was taken care of and having a great time!  They got all of us to let loose and act like kids again.  The food was great!  I was shocked at what kind of meals they can make for us day after day.  No one went away hungry!  As a brand new camper, and not sure if I'd like sleeping on the ground and not showering for two weeks, I came away from the trip wanting to go again! In my book that is the highest praise that can be given.  If you can, book the full canyon trip. I found that we all hit our stride right around day 5 or so and if you book a shorter trip that is about the time you have to leave.  Plus, the canyon is so different from week one to week two that you will miss a lot of awesome and amazing things.  Book your AZRA trip now! You absolutely will not be disappointed."
22,Amazing Adventure in the Grand Canyon,"Just completed a 16 day ""Hikers Discovery"" full canyon tour.  AZRA was the best!  Great guides, wonderful hikes, excellent food.  2 weeks of beautiful starry nights, amazing geology, intriguing native American history, and no cell/wifi interruptions.  A great way to put life into perspective.This is a great trip, but it is arduous; don't come unless you really want to be here.  You will be cold, you will be wet... follow the AZRA packing guidelines.  2 weeks of sleeping on the ground in blowing sand with primitive toilet facilities can be trying.  Hikes involve a lot of vertical gain/loss, bushwhacking on rocks, over boulders, and wading through waist deep streams... not a good place for high maintenance feet.  Rapids are huge & lots of fun, but there are only 20 some big rapids over 225 miles; so lots of flat water, often with strong headwinds."
23,AzRA Makes Lifelong Dream Come True,"We had a great trip.Wonderful guides, great place, great outfitter.  Going to do a trip with them again as soon as I can.Bert F"
24,Trip of a lifetime,"Rafting through the Grand Canyon was spectacular!! ...and fun, exciting, challenging, exhilarating, wild and peaceful, A timeless journey deep into the heart of the earth. Highly skilled and knowledgeable guides led an amazing trip... exceeded all expectations. AZRA provides great service."
25,Amazing 9 day lower canyon trip.,"My husband & I did this in May.  It was fantastic!  The guides were all very professional even while having fun.  I did learn that whatever they said about the ease or difficulty of a hike, I should take it up a notch.  It was an interesting mix of being spoiled and roughing it."
26,2 weeks of fun,"Superior in every respect. Great guides, wonderful sights, interesting history, superb food. Positive experience from beginning to end."
27,Lifetime of memories,"We had the most AMAZING adventure on our recent group trip with Arizona Raft Adventures (AZRA)!!  We were a large group with a fun variety of adventurous people. The guides truly were the best part of entire trip. Matt, Nate, Kelly, Summer, Kristin, Dave & Will were such a great team!!  They were so encouraging and patient with everyone from 15 year olds to 60 year olds. They encouraged and led group activities and fed us such gourmet food!  I can't thank them enough!"
28,Top Notch A+ Rating Continues ,"I and 6 of my friends chose the Stories and Dory trip this time for our 14 day trip through the Grand Canyon. We had 6 amazing guides, John, Randy , and Kim rowing rafts and Alan as our paddle captain; Dennis rowed the Dory and Brad rowed the Julius (replica of the boat Buzz Holmstrom rowed through the canyon 75 years ago, built by Brad). The added bonus to this trip is having Brad, storyteller and author, on our trip. Every night and through out the day,he related stories of the early Canyon adventurers and his own experiences on the river. It was also great fun to be able to ride with  Dennis in his dory.  All the guides are very knowledge and professional and excellent hikers. The hikes are an amazing part of the canyon experience with hikes into slot canyons and to waterfalls. They gave us options for all levels of ability and are always looking out for our safety, while encouraging you push your limit a little beyond what you thought you could do. And to top it off after rafting and hiking all day, they would turn into amazing chiefs and serve us great meals -- fresh food all 14 days. This really is the only way to experience the Grand Canyon and AzRA is the only company to do it with. You won't go wrong with them.I did a paddle trip with AzRA in 2006 and thought that was my trip of a lifetime, but the call of the Colorado River would not let that be my last trip so went again this year -- 6 years later. There is something about the Canyon that keeps calling you back. So if and when I do another trip it will be with AzRA."
29,Excellent rafting company,"I was amazed by how well coordinated this trip was, by the quality of the guides, by the staggering beauty of the place. I lead retreats all over the world and this was the most well run beautiful trip I have ever taken. Thank you."
30,Best thing I've ever done,"This trip is fantastic for people who love being outdoors, don't mind roughing it (think sleeping on the ground and pooping in a bucket!), want to see some of the world's most stunning scenery, and enjoy a physical challenge (hiking and paddling). The guides are super knowledgeable,smart, funny, skilled, sensitive and work beautifully as a team. They also can cook delicious camp food. Prepare to be wowed. Bring as little as possible other than hat, sunscreen, quick dry clothes and a sense of adventure and you will have the experience of a lifetime!"
31,14 day classic adventure,"The 14 day raft trip was amazing! The river guides and TL Jacob were very professional and kept the group as busy as they wanted. They were able to read the audience to ensure a pleasurable experience for all skill levels. The hikes were challenging and beautiful. The food was outstanding, fresh and tailored to any dietary needs. The friendships between the guests and guides were genuine. I highly recommend this trip to anyone seeking a multi faceted adventure."
32,14 day classic adventure,"Had a great time on our raft trip through the Grand Canyon.  Guides were great and very helpful.  Food was super especially when considering conditions under which it was made.  Scenery unbeatable and guides offered lots of info on history, rock formations and such.  Highly recommend for a get-a-way from everyday humdrum."
33,Incredible experience,"This was the most amazing trip and exceeded all of our expectations.  This was a bucket list item for us to do as a family.  My children 16 and 19 are still talking about our adventure.  Where else can you camp, raft, hike, learn about geology and history in one of the most beautiful places in the world.  Words can't describe this trip. You must experience it and AZRA does an amazing job from start to finish!  Dont put this trip off!"
34,Incredible crew and trip,"This company provides so much more than expected! When my adult daughter suggested a raft trip before she started grad school, I jumped at the chance to spend time with her rafting in the Grand Canyon, a life-long dream of mine. The staff was superb, the food was incredible, the experience was like a high end summer camp I never got to attend, and I can't wait to go back to raft with this company. We took the 14 day trip in May 2015, when it was unseasonably cool and rainy, but AZRA had included warm liners for our sleeping bags so that we would stay warm and comfortable at night. I've been on trips with other companies and they do not compare. There were singles, couples, and families on the trip, so take somebody with you or go alone, but don't wait, the hikes up the side canyons are an experience you do not want to miss."
35,Trip of a Lifetime!!,"Had the most incredible time rafting down the Grand Canyon with Azra! All the guides were absolutely fantastic, they hugely exceeded my expectations! Their knowledge of the history and geology of the canyon was amazing- I expected them to be knowledgeable on the river considering it was a white water rafting trip, but the extra information about the Grand Canyon was so interesting and really made the whole experience for me. The guides were all so friendly, easy to talk, fun and great chefs! The food was phenomenal- we had steaks on our 4th night on the river! The variety of food we had over the 6 for breakfast, lunch and dinner was fantastic! And we had fresh fruit and salad!Steve was our paddle boat guide, we spent 3 out of the 5 days on his boat and he was great- competent, knowledgable, fun and friendly! We spent the other 2 days on Kevin and Howie's oar boats and they were also really great, they've been on the river for years and knew so much about it and told us so many stories, it was so interesting hearing about it all! The other guides on our trip- Larry, Betsie and Dave were all really friendly too! We had lots of fun in the evenings socialising with the guides and the other guests on the trip. I would highly recommend this company for your Grand Canyon white water rafting trip!"
36,What an adventure!!!,"This trip was beyond epic.  The guides far exceeded my expectations and were not only masters of their vessels, but highly intelligent, extremely charming, entertaining and informative.  The food was excellent.  The memories of this adventure will last a lifetime.  I will be back."
37,Outstanding in every way,"If you are planning a float trip on the Colorado go with AzRA! From start to finish the trip was perfectly executed - full of fun, great food, wonderful people (guides and guests!), and of the spectacular scenery of the Grand Canyon!We took a 10-day motor trip through the full canyon (8/26-9/4). I believe AzRA offers a 8-day but I would definitely recommend 10 days as there is so much to see and do 8 days would not be NEAR enough!  Having time to get off the boat and hike some of the side canyons was an absolute must!Our trip leader was Ed Hasse, a veteran boatman with 30+years experience on the river, assisted by his wife Sandra and assistant Steve. Ed led our motley crew through miles of spectacular scenery, fantastic hikes and joyful rapids, always keeping us safe, informed and engaged. A river trip is a great experience for all ages. Our trip ranged between 30-70 years old, but everyone was active and up for great hikes and experiences. The camping is luxurious to those with backwoods experience but pretty rustic for those who are more used to ""car camping"" ie. flush toiliets, showers, etc. Be prepared to bathe in 48 degree water, pee in the river and sleep on the ground! These things might sound impossible to first-timers but they are in fact part of what makes this trip such a memorable experience. Talk about getting away from it all and out of your comfort zone!!The team worked tirelessly to provide fantastic meals that accommodated everyone's tastes and diets. You will not be hungry!!  There are 3 solid meals a day plus snacks and electrolyte drinks/juice/water available all the time!! We checked out some of the other river trips spreads at some popular lunch spots and AzRA's was 10x better!!! :) The rapids are fun but not at all scary on the motor rig. However you will be very wet (which is sometimes great and sometimes freezing)!! The hikes are always optional but I wouldn't miss them if you can help it. There are some amazing sites hidden in the canyon which you can't see from the boat! Depending on the group your guide will really customize the trip so each trip is unique. I will definitely plan to go again as one trip only scratches the surface of what Grand Canyon has to offer and I will definitely go with AzRA!"
38,Beyond my highest expectations -  superb in every way,"We took the Upper Canyon trip in September and it exceeded every expectation!  The AZRA team was wonderful - we always felt safe, the food was great and they took care of every need.  I cannot recommend this company more!  It was a fabulous trip and the pictures don't do the canyon justice."
39,GRAND CANYON PADDLE ADVENTURE,"The Upper Canyon all paddle trip was full of adrenaline, adventure, and awe-inspiring beauty.  We paddled down the Colorado River in synchronized strokes to the tune of churning water.  Flanking red cliffs of ancient stone soared towards the sky. Sometimes the river was serene and peaceful.  Other times, it was turbulent and angry.  We embraced nature around us and experienced the wonder of the Grand Canyon.The tour had 18 guests (6 paddlers / boat x 3 boats).  The guests ranged in age from 30's to 70's with an average age near 60. There were 6 staff members (3 raft guides and 3 support staff in 3 oar boats).  The trip was incredibly well-organized.  The staff was professional and very experienced.   Guides were knowledgable, hilarious, and entertaining.  A typical day: 5:15AM coffee call5:30AM breakfast call (scrambled eggs, toasted bagels, bacon)6:30AM pack up sleeping bag, tent, dry bags, load rafts7:00AM BJ (trip leader) whips out map and corny jokes.  Lectures about rocks and history.7:30AM-8:00AM paddle11:30AM stop for lunch (sandwiches or wraps)12:30PM paddle2:30PM go hiking up a side canyon (see waterfall or petroglyphs)3:30PM raft5:00PM set up camp6:00PM eat dinner (marvelous food!  Steak and mashed potatoes.  Ravioli and garlic bread.  Chicken fajitas.  Freshly baked carrot cake.)7:00PM stories or singing9:00PM sleep under the stars (or in a tent)AZRA is a reputable company with outstanding guides and staff.  The equipment is top quality.  (Tents and sleeping bags are new this year.)  Food was better than what I eat at home.   I loved the trip and highly recommend AZRA for your Grand Canyon rafting adventure.  Forward paddle!"
40,Absolutely Amazing Adventure,"Our trip started with not the best of weather. But our fantastic group of knowledgeable, professional, and super supportive guides kept our spirits up!  Joy, Kevin, Brad, Jacob, Matt, and Tess are the best. The sun came out and our trip was superb. Had a perfect run going thru Lava falls in a Dory !  Exciting rapids, great food & camp sites, and wonderful stories & history along the way."
41,Grand Canyon Rafting Trip,"This was an amazing trip. Our guides were experts on the history, stories, and geology of the canyon, were great cooks, and made sure our every need was met. They did a great job of tailoring our trip to the abilities and needs of our group, including our special-needs son, active teenagers, and older parents. Everyone had a wonderful time and I highly recommend AZRA to anyone thinking about a Grand Canyon raft trip."
42,Lifetime Adventure,"It was an adventure that both my husband and I loved. It was arduous, but we were up for it. We both wished we had been 15- 20 yrs. younger in our 40's or 50's because of the physical nature of the trip, but we made it unscathed. We bike, hike, ski, and  play tennis, so we felt in shape. It helped, but perhaps not enough in shape to climb boulders. But then we had the choice to do the hike or not. It was an adventure of a lifetime.The leaders of our trip were fabulous in leading, great cooks, and terrific at informing us of what was to be expected. We highly recommend this trip to all teens and older persons. The views were fabulous, and the company fantastic. An adventure of a lifetime."
43,Indescribably Excellent,"Its not just the fact you float and paddle serenely, lazily and then full on action with rapids in one of the most beautiful and peaceful settings you will experience, but its how you do it. You do it with a mixture of people you might never otherwise meet, with a crew that makes it fun, safe and seemingly never tire of attention to detail, and without the need for constant electronic communication or external intrusions. You go to bed when the sun goes down and get up when it comes up to the sound of ""coffees up"" and you pack up your camp (we did this in June when it was so hot you slept outside every night, no biting insects, but sometimes some fierce hot wind and sand storms!) and indulge in some heavy breakfast. Our team had 3 raft guides and 3 support crew (which is a little demeaning because they are pretty skilled themselves but row your luggage and food!) plus some extra staff experiencing what it means to be crew a trip. From our initial contact with AZRA we were impressed with their responsiveness, attention to detail and customer focus (sound likes cliches I know) but also their commitment/passion to the river. All the guides seem to have spent more of their lives on the river than on land, and it showed. They knew the river, the topography and geology, the wildlife and numerous entertaining and tall tails to enliven the longer drifts on the river. They could play guitar, cook, tell stories and at will conjure dress up costumes for ""summer solstice parties"" and ""lava falls celebrations"". Every night we had oven stove ""treats"" to celebrate little known birthdays, minor events and nothing in particular. In the day, after what we might call a languid mornings planning by team leader ""If i was more laid back and understated I might just float away"" Matt we would hear where we were heading, where we had been and what it all meant- then a little reading from the poetry/literature of the river- sounds corny but it wasn't. Then you jump on a boat and paddle- somedays it was lots of paddling and not many rapids, others the reverse, in June on average most days were 100F or above and getting wet was essential- rapids welcome, be prepared to ""flip"" and ""swim"" the rapids, be prepared to hike canyons to view other swimming holes/waterfalls and rivers, some easy, some challenging, none boring or repetitive. Its amazing how varied the canyons can be. Lunch is prepared for you and stops are usually beaches/rock platforms or magically in the river when you are at Havasu! In the evening you pull up at another sandy spot and locate yourself to avoid the intense retained heat of the canyon walls, be near the cool river. Naturally hardship needs to be broken and liquid refreshment appears from the ""bar"" and is cooled in the river- what sort of hardship must man endure when you can only bring 4 cans/person/night?! So whats the difference between the upper/lower canyon?- well its really how much time&budget you have to spare, whether you like walking in/out at Bright Angel trail and if you like camping. The upper canyon has less ""hikes"" but probably more intense paddling/rapids in the shorter time, and the canyon is more enclosed. Little colorado river is unmissable beauty and fun- floating through the intense lime blue waters on your life jacket and ""the exploration of the wild lands- aka your guides pretend to be water monsters""  is a highlight. The lower canyon opens up more, the water colour changes and the canyons are more their for hiking- the rapids are more dispersed but you get plenty especially Crystal (flip here tick!), upset and Lava just to mention a few.  We did 14 and regretted nothing except ending and going home.Is it hard? well the fitter you are and the more camping savvy the easier it is to settle in. But plenty of our travellers had little or no experience and most adapt to sleeping outdoors, portable toilets and ""weeing"" in the river. The paddling requires some attention but everyone seems to get it (flipping early certainly reminds you why attention to technique matters!) and the walking- its hard in the sense its often on uneven paths, climbing is needed and its hot. But nothing attempted nothing gained! But the reality is its still easy- the guides do the hard work, you help with loading and unloading. They cook and the food is fabulous and in excess..you wont starve!Would I recommend AZRA? Absolutely and I can say no ""paid adventure holiday"" has come close to the perfection of organisational skill, personnel and personal attention, education, fun and community. It was truly the adventure of a lifetime and we still wish we were riding a rapid or pulling in to shore for the evenings camp as BJ calls out ""dinners nearly ready""...Matt, BJ, Margaux, Claire, Doty and Wesley- thanks to you all, you did us proud."
44,Birthday Trip to Remember,My title says it all.  Yes it was that Good!!!  Guides great adventure great food great.  The ultimate outdoor adventure.  Good briefs daily u knew what to expect.My title says it all.  Yes it was that Good!!!  Guides great adventure great food great.  The ultimate outdoor adventure.  Good briefs daily u knew what to expect.
45,Checked off  on Bucket List,"well run, exciting, diverse experiences (rafting, hiking, swimming, nature), excellent foodnote that this is not for the weak or fussy-- it's camping for 9 or 15 straight days without bathing opportunities.  Laundry in silty brown river water really doesn't work very well.  Heed the warnings about foot care, they also apply to your backside and hands.  Be sure your underwear doesn't have seams around the bikini line or anywhere on the backside where they will chafe when sitting on a convex hard rubber surface all day.For better health, bring fresh dry clothes for each day, lots of wet-wipes, and pay the $$ to have your stuff delivered by mule at the beginning/end."
46,outstanding,"Spending 14 days rafting thru the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River with AzRA was a life changing experiences,  The beauty  of the canyon can only be appreciated by being there.  The slower pace thru the canyon allowed us to experience many side canyon hikes.  The guides have outstanding knowledge of geology and historical knowledge of life in the canyon. The rapids are only a small part of experience.I went during the rainy season so had some spectacular waterfalls coming over the side canyon walls. The river was a little brown, so I would recommend taking tan colored clothes to wear. Don't forget a camera in a waterproof case or a waterproof camera.If you have the time it is well worth taking  the longer Hybrid or Paddle raft trips thru the Canyon as you  have so much more time to experience all the canyon has to offer.The AzRA Guides are caring and a ton of fun plus excellent cooks.I hope to return again on of these years"
47,Expedition adventure of a lifetime,"We were on a 14 day trip led by Nate Klema.  It was outstanding.  This was the type of trip you could either choose to paddle or ride in a boat with an oarsman.  The rapids were  exciting, the guides gave us stories and knowledge and the group was cohesive.  I am recommending this to everyone.  Some things I would do differently.  1) fishing was poor so I would not bring that stuff.  2) no need for a towel, I air dried for the most part.  3) could have used a bunch more moisturizer.  I had brought what I thought was a generous amount but it was not.  4) I assumed the rain pants were just for a winter trip.  The splashing from the rapids made me cold. I could have used some rain pants even on this June trip.  5) someone brought a cheap pair of scrubs (walmart) for sun protection that would have been good."
48,Awesome!,"Our all woman crew - Ariel, Alex and Gwen made this fabulous trip even more wonderful than we had expected.  They went out of their way to keep the trip fun for our teenagers and oldsters alike.  They brought sand games, decorations for July 4th, dress up clothes to get silly in, loads of information and stories about the canyon, and a deep love of the canyon.  They monitored the group closely at all times - protecting our safety, gauging our endurance, keeping us motivated and interested.  Kudos also to the staff back at Flagstaff who kept the expedition well organized.  Meals were wonderful and healthy, amenities such as chairs were greatly appreciated. We always had excellent response when calling prior to the trip with questions, and the items in the store were high quality.  Everyone on the trip had a memorable trip and thoroughly enjoyed it."
49,The Only Way to Experience the Canyon!,"This was a dream: white water, native history, geology, sleeping under the open sky and best of all stories told by Brad Dimock."
50,Amazing 8 Day Motorized trip with family,"Fantastic experience. Besides the incredible scenery, cannot praise AZRA more highly. From the pre trip planning and communications, trip logistics, outstanding food - everything was excellent. But the highest praise is for the guides, they were professional, passionate about the river, history, and geology. The were incredibly caring and supportive for the customers, and extremely friendly. Paul Weiss"
51,"First the Upper (1998) then the Lower (2008), and then the whole thing.","This 8 day motorized rafting trip through the entire Grand Canyon (some 225 miles) was simply fantastic and is *highly* recommended. Apart from the astounding scenery (perhaps expected), the guides were wonderful in every aspect (knowledge, attitude, organization, personality, and professionalism), and the overall organization was excellent. The same top rating applies to the food provided - to all three meals served every day - quality and variety were simply amazing, all the way to the very last meal. We appreciated the considerable effort that went into their meal plan, preparations, and then the cooking. We had good friends from Germany accompanying us, and this was the trip of a lifetime for all of us. Kudos also for the spectacular views from some of the locations of the ""groover""!"
52,Fabulous trip for our family,"We were all pumped up to hike down the Bright Angel Trail and enjoy the magnificent views, and then to have 9 days rafting down the river was even more memorable. The guides from Arizona Rafting were awesome, and made the adventure even better. I can't think of a better way to spend a vacation."
53,Don't Need No Stinking Bucket List,"Loved the whole trip with Randy, Dave and Erin as our thoughtful, and knowledgably generous crew... happy to have experienced such a wonderland of rapids, terrain and exceptional hikes with waterfalls.  My family of four enjoyed the 7 night 8 day trip of a lifetime together and I will definitely recommend such a trip to my friends."
54,Amazing Trip of a Lifetime,"Our AzRA trip was fantastic. They are thorough, courteous and the guides' love of The Canyon was evident on all levels. We learned and saw the Geology, Wildlife and Plantlife. The tents/bags etc were easy to use. The food was fresh and excellent. The Spring trip meant clear water, an uncrowded river, and moderate temperatures. The hiking was good, but practice uphill hiking and be in shape! Will do it again👍👍"
55,9 day rafting trip in the Lower Grand Canyon,"Did a 8 day motorize river run program thru Roades Scholar and NASU.  Was probably the best experience of my life. The rapids were fun but the Canyon experience touched my soul. We had amazing river guides with Jed and Erin. Food was better than most high class restaurants. The knowledge and love of the canyon shared with us by these two individual cannot be measured. I know this review sounds ""touchy, feely"" and I am not normally that ""type"" of guy but this was special. My favorite times were shutting off the boat, drifting, floating and sucking in the ""full Canyon experience"". The rapids while fun and what initially attracted me is not what got me or what I am walking away with. The initial part of the river run thru the inaccessible Marble Canyon was an ethereal experience."
56,14 DAY RAFTING TRIP IN HEAVEN,"I taken 5 Grand Canyon trips with AZRA and they have been consistently excellent trips. The trip guides/personnel are the most important element of a great trip. Azra's guides in my 26 years of experience with them are great. There must be a company culture that has persisted because while each of the Guides is a genuinely unique person, as a group they share similar characteristics. Generally they are mature, fun loving, people-centric, competent and interested in sharing their love of the canyon. They are trying to make your trip one of self-discovery and want to do it with a suble, unobtrusive hand. A friend joined me on the trip this year and compared our experience to the trip she took last year with a different company. She said she preferred Azra. While the other company was a little more ""lux"", they were also more uptight and controlling. I hope to do this trip yet again and intend to do it with Azra."
57,Grand Canyon 8-day rafting trip,"Trip Advisor, you should revise this category. AZRA offers many different Colorado river trips; I took the 9-day lower canyon. It was FABULOUS in every respect: guides, food, scenery, weather. I highly recommend Arizona Raft Adventures to everyone planning a rafting trip"
58,AZRA Grand Canyon rafting,"This was an eight day motor trip that has exceeded my expectations eleven times. I enjoyed the last trip just as much as the first trip. A first class trip at a bargain price. It was worth every penny.I have seen a blind couple on a trip enjoying the sounds of the canyon, a handicap trip with people in wheelchairs. There is something there for everyone and AZRA can't be beat."
59,"Fantastic guides, beautiful scenery, magical experience","I just want to comment on the quality of guides that AzRA offers.  I have never taken part in an AzRA commercial adventure, but as a private boater I've had numerous encounters with their guides.  They have never failed to be friendly, engaging, informative and quite helpful--to whomever they come in contact.  It's this attitude that keeps boating on the Colorado special.  My gratitude to them and to the vision of the company for recognizing the value of keeping good relations.  On this principal alone, I would heartily recommend a commercial trip with this organization.Dennis Smith   Enterprise, Oregon"
60,Bucket List Trip,I did the full river with Azra and had a blast!  The guides were all really fun people and were able to share a wealth of fun and informative stories.  I really enjoyed learning about the history of the canyon mixed in with really great personal stories of river rafting and guiding.
61,Sublime 8 day trip through the Grand Canyon,"AZRA provided an outstanding trip.  We were on the motorized 8 day trip.  The crew was wonderful and made the trip very enjoyable.  The food was excellent and there was more food than we could consume.  The tents were comfortable but somewhat small so unless you are with your spouse, it could get uncomfortable.  I was traveling with my brother in law and we are both large so we would not have been able to fit in a tent.  Fortunately there was an extra tent.  We hiked most days the the crew provided alot of information about the canyon.  Overall a wonderful experience."
62,Upper Canyon Rafting Trip - 6 great days!,"The AZRA guides might not be Houdini but they sure will help you escape to one of the most incredible places on earth.Breathtaking scenery, world class whitewater are key ingredients in this adventure recipe.This is really ""trip of a lifetime"" and you have a choice if outfitters. I choose AZRA for my second trip.....Big ol shout out to Owen (trip leader), Andrew , Alexa, Liam, John, Alan and Kevin. Thank you for helping make some life memories.Steve T"
63,Upper Canyon Rafting Trip- 6 days,"Been down the Grand Canyon now twice with AzRA, great people. The food well just great. The guides , great cooks and very knowledgeable about the the canyon and all the people that have been there before us. I liked the motor trips best, one week was all my old body could take."
64,Eight Amazing Days,"I thought I would lose weight, but nooooo the crew cooked fabulous healthy delicious meals every day, three times a day!!!The crew..... Totally awesome!! Kevin, John, Margo, David, Kim, the two assistants, Jane and Scott.... Y'all rock!! They knew so much about everything, made everyone feel secure through every rapid, told some killer stories and made the trip magical!!!The group.... I didn't think I would have so much fun with such a diverse group. We all ended up on the south rim, enjoying the rest of the night AND morning!!! Can't wait for the pics!For anyone contemplating booking the trip.... DO IT!!!Everyone is kind, generous, helpful and full of life, let everything go for a week.... And forget the real world existsThanks again Kevin, John, Margo, David, Kim, Jane and Scott"
65,8 day motor rafting trip in Grand Canyon,"You can be in the parade of life or watch it go by. A trip for all who love some excitement surrounded by the most incredible setting you could imagine.Third trip with AZRA and it just  gets better each time. It's like any trip, better with friends and loved ones. Sometimes it's hard to get everyone to go at the same time. Just go, really just go. I've gone three times with these guys, two solo, you will make some great friends on your trip.Their guides are the best in the business. BIG OLD SHOUT OUT to Dirk, Jody, Michele , Claire, Jed and Aaron. Thank you ! Steve Thomas"
66,6-Day Grand Canyon Classic Rafting Adventure,"What a fabulous trip!!  8 days of getting wet, being hot & cold, being incredibly well-fed, and educated.  Our AZRA guides were expert boatsmen, great cooks, & incredibly knowledgeable about the river -- its geology, history, & just-fun-stories.  As this had been on my bucket list for most of my adult life, I had thought it would be the ""trip of a lifetime.'  In fact, it's just one of many trips of a lifetime -- I can't wait to go back, and for a longer trip."
67,well organized but could have been better,"On our way home after an amazing 15 day full canyon trip.  Indescribable what we experienced!  The boatmen were so professional and personable.  I was quite hesitant about my lack of experience in white water, but our crew was incredible in their ability to put me at ease.  Food was amazing, whitewater was exhilarating, and the company of fellow travelers was wonderful.  I cannot say enough about AzRA!  Thank you for truly a life changing vacation!  (Believe what you read about the sand - it gets everywhere, so plan accordingly.  Pack light and enjoy the journey)."
68,Trip of a Lifetime,"This was our 2nd trip with AZRA.  Our 1st trip was non-motorized.  Both types are outstanding adventures.  Our trip leader and crew were skilled, attentive, knowledgeable and FUN!  They work hard to make sure every guest can participate in activities at their comfort level.  Food!?!  It's tasty, and there's plenty of it.  You will not go hungry.  It's one thing to stand at the rim of Grand Canyon and look it over.  It's another to experience Grand Canyon from the Colorado River and see all of the geological layers that create its rugged beauty.  On our trip (April 18 - 27) we observed migratory birds, bighorn sheep, flowering cacti, and other blooming wildflowers.  If this is one of your bucket list items, start planning ASAP.  Trips fill up fast.  If you have kids, this makes a great family vacation.  Young and old will have a blast on, for many, this once in a lifetime adventure.  Choose AZRA - you won't be disappointed."
69,Canyon Rafting: Why you need to go again:,"This was a highlight of my life.  WOW.  This is a beautiful, raw, unspoiled, untamed, challenging trip for 14 days through the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River.  This trip will require your resourcefulness, is very hard on your hands. and you will find sand in places you never ever knew you had places.  AZRA has perfected the equation.  The guides are exceptional.  Our trip leader had 149 trips to his credit.  The food was incredible. From the 6 burner expedition stoves to the dutch oven lasagna and peach cobblers.  The guides will challenge you to exceed you comfort zones but make sure you are safe.  This ain't Disneyland. It is rugged and raw.  I'm not going to sugarcoat if.  But if you are up to it, this is a trip a a lifetime.  Very few people can take this trip, but if  you can , jump at one of the few chances to get on a raft or dory.  AZRA prepared me for the pre-trip, trip, and post-trip.  I'm getting too old to do this again.  But I would go tomorrow If my wife and let me and AZRA had an opening."
70,Best Rafting Company on the River!,"It is hard to know where to start, but this trip was way more than the sum of it's parts. When we started the trip, I was expecting to go rafting for 2 weeks, but was not anticipating so much more. The desert sky at night, waking early to watch the black canyon walls dissolve into textures and then colors. Camping on the beach under the stars with an incredible sand storm one night, great hikes, and swims on side canyons, checking out the slot canyons, and jumping off cliffs. Acting like a kid again. The guides were fantastic, the food was great, and the rafting was good too!. Got to paddle and row as much as I wanted, but the guides kept me from getting into too much trouble. Views from the groover! Did I mention the camaraderie, fun and games, hanging with the guides having a beer or two in the evening, listening to great stories.......... Rafting with the legend Randy Tucker, incomparable Bev, Katie as team leader, Dasch rowing sweep, and Jody as captain of Caballo Blanco. A wonderful experience I would recommend to anyone. And AzRa - they are the best!"
71,Big Water in the Grand Canyon,"Excellent from beginning to end. Paddle boat option, amazing hikes, solitary floating to action packed rapids. The guides are passionate about the river, canyons and maintaing the beauty. highly recommend this company for a perfect blend of adventure with a safe and supportive twist."
72,Completed another Bucket List Item,"Nearly as amazing as the scenery in the Grand Canyon and along the Colorado River, is the knowledge and service provided by the guides from Arizona Raft Adventures. Our trip leaders, Andrew, Alan, Derrick, Steve, Tess and Bev were as knowledgable about the Canyon's history and geology as they were experts at navigating the thrilling whitewater. In a potentially dangerous arena, I never felt unsafe. In the desolate desert, I was never hungry. Amidst the isolation, all of my senses were sufficiently stimulated. And yet, there was still plenty of time to decompress, unwind and reflect. My six days on the Colorado River with its thrilling whitewater, its sandy beaches, and billion year old rocks created memories that will last a lifetime. Will I be going back? Hell yes!!!"
73,Adventure of a lifetime!,"We did the 14 day classic oar boat trip. The AZRA team, both guides and office staff were  exceptional.  The  logistically complicated trip was beautifully choreographed from start to finish.   Food was superb, plentiful  and fresh after 14 days.  The guides are highly skilled at what they do, not only in their all-important rowing skills, but also in their knowledge of the canyon's geology and human history, plus they're just super fun to hang out with.  I'd go anywhere with any single one of them.  Can't say enough."
74,Excitement off the grid,"I'm a 50ish yr old avid hiker/skier who usually does self guided trips.  Not having rafting skills my husband booked a full canyon trip with AZRA and filled it up with our friends.  So with 17 kindred spirits we started down the the Colorado.  Ours guides were knowledgeable, competent, personable and fun!.  Sleeping out under the stars for 14 nights was a unique experience.  Where I live in the Yukon we can rarely do that due to insects.  There were none there and I found I loved watching the stars glide across the night sky.  The river keep us interested every day with big  rapids and interesting side hikes.  It was one of the best  trips of my life."
75,(Another) fantastic trip!,"I am not sure if we were amazingly lucky or if every trip is as fun as ours... I was signed up for the 6 day upper half hybrid trip with my in-laws and I know a couple of us were a little nervous- whether it was to be with the in-laws for so many days in a row- or to hike out the Bright Angel Trail we had a little trepidation....Turns out we were nervous over nothing!  The setting is breathtakingly beautiful, of course.... but the best part was the people.  Our guides, BJ, Kim, Somer, JohnO, and Jerry all were very knowledgable, kept us safe, fed us well, and made sure we had a good time doing everything.  Furthermore, we had an amazing group of people around us, all had great stories, amazing attitudes, and an appetite for adventure.  We could not have had more fun- between paddling through rapids, floating down the Little Colorado river, seeing ""sideways"" waterfalls, and learning about the geology of one of the seven wonders of the world- everything was well planned an amazingly fun for everyone in the group.... We had one group member who was 70 years old (though you would never believe it- he practically trotted up the Bright Angel Trail) and one who was 12, they both had unimaginable fun!  I can not recommend a trip with AZRA more, I never thought it would be that special to go down the Canyon- it is something I would absolutely do again, and recommend to everyone I know.  In fact, our group is planning a reunion trip down the second half in the future.If you have ever considered really seeing the Grand Canyon this is the way to go!"
76,Epic family rafting trip on the Upper Colorado!,"We recently completed the upper half classic adventure. It was truly on of the funnest family experiences we have ever had. My 15 year old and 12 year old son's loved the trip! My husband and I also enjoyed every minute of the trip and hope to go back some day to do the lower half. AzRA was great, they took care of our every need and created a fun and educational experience. I think the highlight for our family was the day we spent at the Little Colorado River. So magical! We giggled and played in the water all day, so much fun. I would recommend AzRA to anyone looking for a great experience rafting the Colorado!"
77,Two Weeks Unlike Any Other,"We did a 7 day river rafting trip with Arizona River Rafters.  This was so memorable it's hard to put into words.  The guides are fantastic and know so much about the history, geology, archeology, and they're awesome cooks too!  They navigate the river with such amazing expertise, I was never the least bit nervous.  I was the least ""able"" of the members of our group and there was always someone there to assist me getting on/off the raft, carrying dry bags to the camp, etc. We slept out under the stars each night on cots and it was incredible.  Tents are available but no one used one and they were completely unnecessary.  If you think you've been to the Grand Canyon, you haven't ""seen"" it unless you get on the river.  The helicopter ride at the end of the trip was frosting on the cake.  EVERYONE should do this.  We had a single mom with her 8 and 11 years old boys on our trip and they kept thanking her for taking them on this adventure.  It is definitely a must!"
78,Perfect Grand Canyon Trip / Expedition,"Azra is the way to go if you are going to raft the Colorado. I really felt like the guides individually planned our trip based on every single persons interests.  This was pretty amazing because because we had a full spectrum of activity levels just with in my family group, from very active to happy to be hanging close to the boats in the shade.  Everyday was a new adventure and really made me appreciate so much more than just rafting which is what I came for.   The food was top notch and they did wonderful things with their Dutch Oven every night for yummy desserts.  There was another memeber of our group who was on his 9th Azra trip and I can see why, when I return it will be Azra all the way."
79,Experience of a Lifetime!,"AzRA staff - from the back office to the drivers and guides - are second to none!  They take care to make your Grand Canyon experience special.  This trip is perfect for those who want to see the canyon from the river.  There is a good blend of whitewater rafting, hiking, sleeping under the stars, history, geology, and more.  The food is excellent, and the views are spectacular!"
80,GREATEST ESCAPE !!!!,"The Grand Canyon doesn't need a review.  Considering a rafting trip? It's the experience of a lifetime if you 1) want beauty and excitement 2) don't mind sleeping on the ground 3)aren't grossed out by peeing in the river and 4) don't mind defecating in a portable toilet that then rides in the rafts with you every day. If you are still on board, the experience with Azra was superlative.  Amazing guides - not just knowledgeable and technically superb, but genuinely interested in the guests and supportive of our  strengths and cognizant of our fears, getting us through rapids and up on rocks to waterfalls.  As someone afraid of ledges and edges, they helped me get through on most of them, and left someone with me, and others, when it wasn't our cup of tea.The guides are knowledgeable in everything from wilderness medicine to geology to archeology to group process!Azra's website, packing lists, etc were perfect.  A fantastic two weeks of beauty, learning, exercise, friendship."
81,"Awesome trip, top notch guides, very well organized.","Our family had the trip of a lifetime with the AZRA guides on the music trip in July.  Tommy, Chad, Patrick, Liz, Claire, Will, and George were simply amazing.  Our travel partners on the trip were also amazing and we've made friends for a lifetime.  AZRA staff are true professionals.  We can't thank them enough for the incredible experience they provided our family."
82,Hitting the rapids...........,"AzRA as an organization: 10+ out of 10AzRA as the facilitator of the vacation of a lifetime: 10+ out of 10AzRA as the steward of a treasured natural resource: 10+ out of 10AzRA as host and ""field guide"" for a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon: 10+ out of 10In July 2007 my two teenage sons and I embarked on an adventure that very nearly became a disaster. United Airlines canceled our flight to AZ, then failed to do anything with our luggage – yes, everything we needed for the three of us for 10 days in the wilderness – sat in SFO while AzRA staff (Kim, Diane) assured us that all was not lost. They went above and beyond to ensure we made it to the rafts. With little time AzRA helped us gather the essentials we needed and, after missing the shuttle to the South Rim, even gave us a ride. The trip down the river couldn’t have been more fabulous. Day 1 I cried at the thought of what we almost missed; day 2 I realized how little we really needed to survive; day 3 I was glad I had purchased travelers insurance. The other travelers from parts all over the US were easy to get along with (some of us still stay in touch), and our guides were gracious, fun, interesting, intelligent, and professional. The food was great, the hiking options suited to our liking, and the ""accommodations"" (camping spots along the river) were incredible. AzRA definitely knows what they are doing, and I could not recommend them more highly."
83,"14 days of Action, Fun, Education and challenge- just do it!","The 14 day trip is a glorious way to experience the Grand Canyon, and so much more than a river trip. You may think you are going for 14 days of a whitewater, hiking, and sleeping under the stars adventure, but turns out you will never be the same. The AzRa guides are amazing. Their passion and knowledge is apparent in so many ways that make the trip special. Getting to know them is a highlight of the trip. As you descend through the geological layers of time, the canyon seeps into your soul with stories, music, poetry, humor and just silence. Travelers initially hesitant to paddle and row are soon confident and happy to jump in. The guides knew just when to add frivolity, whether a swim in the Little Colorado with life vest worn like diapers or a birthday cake lit by a furnace of propane, but could create sublime moments with music to underscore the unfathomable stretch of time in the walls of a slot canyon. New friendships are created and old ones deepened. It is a magical 14 days."
84,9 Day Paddle Trip - Grand Canyon,"I spent a week on the water with AzRA rafting the Grand Canyon.  The guides were not only proficient in their water craft, but also very knowledgeable of the canyon and shared that information.  The food was well above expectations.  I am comfortable with stating that AzRA is a must do experience."
85,The Trip of a Life Time!!!!,"This was my second canyon trip, and first with AZRA. Both trips were oar raft supported, with some friends and me in hard shell kayaks.My first trip was 36 years ago on >50k cfs releases in 1984 on a private trip when I was in my prime years of boating before years and injuries took their toll. “It’s not the years it’s the milage”. - Indiana Jones. Actually it’s the years too.I remember AZRA guides from 36 years ago who gave my friends and me great advice on hikes and campsites. The guides on this trip were one and two generations younger, and had clearly learned much from their elders, while building much more, so that a safe, entertaining, and challenging trip was had by all.While this trip, at levels of 9k to 16k cfs, was an easier flow level (on some - but not all drops), my kayaking skills have waned, so I was worried (and I think so were the guides after I back endered and swam in Georgie) at the start. By the end I was renewed and revitalized.AZRA provided much more than kayak support, they supported my family and friends, providing each of them a unique Grand Canyon experience, sometimes together, sometimes in separate rafts, while I was able to focus on redevelopment of old skills, flush away cobwebs of doubt from under my helmet, convert about 10 pounds of COVID-19 fat to 5 pounds of muscle, get my river roll back, and learn some new techniques. I’m an old dog with some new tricks now.Thank you Liam, Adam, Colter, Maggie, Matt, Will, Omar, Kendall, and Mishael!—Boof"
86,Absolutely amazing from start to finish,"Traveling on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon is like a visit to another planet and 15 days was barely enough to time to scratch the surface of the place. It was easy to imagine the surroundings as the ruins of a giant civilization and the scale is so enormous that it's hard to wrap your head around. Our guides tired their best though and I'm certain we had 6 of the strongest, smartest, most experienced boatmen on the river at our service for the duration of the trip.  They gave us endless opportunities and assistance  to participate in breathtaking adventures while steering us away from those that were better avoided. They educated us, rowed us, cooked great food for us, shared great stories and generally passed along their passion for this amazing place. The trip was expertly coordinated, especially considering that conditions changed from minute to minute and there was no predicting what might happen next. Pre and post trip information was abundant at all the right times and all our endless questions were cheerfully answered by Azra. Nothing I can write will come close to describing the singular experience of the trip.  Many thanks to Matthew, Neal, Tess, J. Palmer, Brad and Lynn and everyone who helped make this an experience of a lifetime."
87,Prepare to have your life changed for the better,"This 6 day raft and hike out on the Bright Angel Trail was an amazing experience.  I have always wanted to see the grand Canyon from the bottom.  Azra was a great choice. They were extremely helpful any time I needed to call to ask a question.  I always felt confident on the rafts that we were in good, experienced hands.  The guides were very knowledgeable about the geology of the canyon.  However, it is a very strenuous adventure.  The day hikes were hard but well worth the effort.  You are outside for 6 days.  Wet, sandy, hot.  All worth it in my opinion, but not for everyone.  The hike out the Bright Angel Trail is 7.5 miles--up.  With full back pack.  Definitely not for the out of shape.  But it was all fantastic.  I can check this off my bucket list."
88,Outstanding!!,"This was the trip of a lifetime.  A nice balance of daily rafting, hiking and checking out slot canyons.  Being down in the canyon and riding through the layers was indescribable.  Just so beautiful.  Our fellow trippers were great and we shared many laughs during our time together. The guides were absolutely wonderful! Their experience in reading the rapids was evident and our confidence in our guides never wavered.   Each brought their own set of talents.......storytelling, geology of the Grand Canyon, guitar playing,  ""power stripes"" and stick on tattoos 😊,   The food was good and always plentiful.  Each morning, after breakfast, our head guide gave a rundown on the day's activities.  Time passed very quickly.  The camping sites were always interesting, mostly sandy but on rock ledges 2 evenings.  The 16 days on the river flew by and I started this trip being quite nervous about rafting the rapids!!  If you enjoy learning and being in the great outdoors this is a trip for you.  Some of the hikes involved exposure and you should be aware of this on certain days if you have height issues.  A waterproof camera is great on this trip.  Clothing is very much season dependent.  This was an October trip and I would say to keep the cotton clothes for camp with quick dry clothes on the rafts.  Rain coat with sleeves and necks that you can cinch down as water does get up your arms on some rapids.  I recommend light gloves on the rafts for holding on and preventing your knuckles from being rubbed and sore."
89,"""Thrilling Adventure. Outstanding Service.""",We just completed the upper canyon trip with AZRA.  What an amazing trip!  The lead guide Tom O’Hara was great as was all the other guides and assistants.  We went on an all paddle trip - it was much more exciting than just riding on an oar boat or taking a motorized trip.  We were a bit concerned about the hike outbon Bright Angel trail in the heat of the canyon but AZRA fully prepared us - it was a piece of cake and stunningly beautiful.  Thank you AZRA!
90,An awesome week on the River!,"Best trip of 4 months of cycling tours, trekking national Parks.Grand canyon from the river is just awe inspiring due to the 1200 m high shear walls which change in type and colour as the river has slowly eroded through millions of years of rock.The 5 boatmen were very skilled rivermen and women, but also could explain the Geology, and history of the grand canyon in simple terms that normal people could understand.We had fresh lettuce on the 12th night due to experienced packingand management  ofhigh quality coolers, and the steak was better than most high end steak resturants that I visited done the west coast of USA!"
91,One of the most AWESOME Adventures of my life!!!,"ARZA took care of every detail in the most professional fun fantastic way from being to end. I was totally impressed. Being a bit faint of heart we took the 8-day motorized boat trip with a group of 19 and five guides that were all so interesting experienced and amazing fun folk. Jay Summer Betzy Andy Emma. Started at Lees Ferry -226 miles of really fun rapids- lava falls the biggest but so many more in between big and small. Scenery was out of National Geographic as we rolled down the river stopping multiple times a day at points of interest and challenging hikes. We definitely pushed our limits with hikes involving climbs up and over rocks 1.8 billion years old and as big as a car and shimming inches along ledges and sheer cliffs. Our guides were always right there to verbally or physically help you get to the other side. Don't get me started on the food-never would you get hungry as a delicious meal was right around the next rapid it seemed. NY strip steaks cooked medium rare, full blown thanksgiving meal with mashed potatoes gravy stuffing cranberry sauce, breakfast maybe bagels and lox with fresh lemon slices, capers or biscuits sausage gravy eggs cooked to order and the best cowboy coffee you'll ever have. I could hardly wait for the coffee call in the very early mornings.Beautiful campsites to see the Milky Way and as many shooting stars your slowly closing eyes could ever see. Bit of advice- take half of the clothes you pack. You wear the same stuff all the time. Bring biodegradable soap and rinse your clothes out hang to dry (although we went aug and can't speak for May etc) as the hardest part was rifling through your dry bags.Yes the water is freezing and you get used to it. Take advantage of the waterfall hikes and bathe / rinse your hair but no soap!We waited almost two years for this trip....it was magical.....wish I was still there."
92,Trip of a Lifetime,"I waited to write this evaluation and let the late May 14 day Grand Canyon all paddle trip age somewhat to give me some perspective.  When I return to the Canyon next time it will not be with AZRA even though this was my second trip with them.  I had two major concerns.The first was alcohol.  River running is the only occupation I know that encourages and endorses drinking on-the-job.  We had a group of 17 with seven guides.  I cannot say I observed any of the guides inebriated.  However, they did enjoy their beers once we setup camp.  Many if not most back country injuries occur in camp.  I prefer that anyone administering first aid at 9 pm at night or 1 am in the morning be alcohol-free.  I prefer that anyone handling an evacuation be alcohol-free.  In fact, within two weeks of my return there were two fatalities on the river, one being a kayaker who drowned in Badger Rapids and a second as a result of an allergic reaction.  I cannot recall such alcohol usage on the six day paddle I took with AZRA back in 2004.  However, and how telling, after that trip I was discussing Canyon outfitters with a colleague at a national meeting and he described a dreadful experience he had on the river with a group he organized.  The guides just got stinking drunk.  I was surprised when he told me it was an AZRA trip.  I can also see from my trip this year that AZRA apparently endorses and encourages under age drinking including a member of the staff.  The other problem with alcohol in the backcountry is that it causes injuries, compounds the mechanisms of injuries and complicates treatment.  As the guides so accurately stated several times, we had a responsibility to look out for each other: sun exposure, hydration, patience, team work.  The only way to get through the rapids was to paddle “all together now.”  A person injured in the backcountry becomes a liability for the group.  We had at least one participant who got drunk every night. He was found wandering down by the river early one morning staggering about.  It’s not too far-fetched to imagine him slipping into the river, and since we camped by rapids many nights, being swept downstream and one bloated body being fished out of Lake Mead.  Alcohol also complicates hydration in a desert environment.  I have been around rivers long enough and I am not naïve to think that there can be an alcohol-free trip.  But it is certainly a criterion I will thoroughly examine before I book my next trip. Wilderness and alcohol just don’t mix well.The other consideration, more of a philosophical note, is why bring a stimulant or a compound which alters your consciousness into a place, to take John Denver’s phrase, that is “almost heaven.”  And one more consideration is that in my state there were about 20 water-related fatalities in 2013.  Need I tell you the common factor in most?  The second concern was minor in the bigger scheme of things but major when put in perspective.  The guides, much to their credit, detoured immediately to fish any trash out of the river.  Toward the end of the trip I spotted a piece and when we paddled closer it turned out to be an oar blade broken from its shaft.  With no objection from anyone else in the boat, I claimed it.  It would be a good match for the broken paddle I had hanging on my patio from the New River. I asked one of the guides to stow it until we reached the takeout.  When I asked about it on the last day I was told that it was left at the last campsite.This deception just kept echoing off the Canyon walls for three reasons.1.	To their credit, the guides practiced Leave No Trace ethics.  They appropriately and repeatedly emphasized to the group that 25,000 people traveled down the Colorado River every year and it was our responsibility to keep camp pristine.  Before we departed everyday there was always a yell about a water bottle or some other item left on shore.  Neither a scrap of paper nor a scrap of food was left.  Yet, somehow a paddle blade about 30 inches long and 5 inches wide was overlooked.2.	There was no reason for the blade to be taken off the equipment raft.  The next evening after discovery, I did ask a guide to saw off the jagged edge so I could ship it once I reached Flagstaff.  Afterwards, it was stowed again.3.	In the evening of the discovery, one guide asked if I was willing to part with my souvenir since the guide captain had worked for Outdoor Adventures (their name was embossed on the blade) and she would like to keep it.  I respectfully declined.  So I think I know what happened to the ghost oar blade.My patio is not naked without it.  However, perhaps my confidence in using this outfitter for 14 days on a river was laid bare.  Raindrops become rivers and little lies become deceit.  And perhaps my next trip to the Grand Canyon will be with an outfitter that values safety and can live with integrity."
93,Extraordinary Knowledge and Guiding Skills With Top Notch Service,"My husband and I just completed the 6 day Upper Canyon rafting trip and it was wonderful!  This trip consisted of 22 travelers and 6 AZRA team members, with 5  oar rafts, and one paddle boat.  We were on the trip with four other friends.The AZRA crew were fantastic!  We had the opportunity to raft with a different team member each day, and they were very knowledgeable about the geology, flora, and fauna of the canyon.  They were very friendly and made the trip all the more enjoyable.The rafting was great fun- be prepared to get wet!   But we were never concerned for our safety and we never felt like we would fall out of the raft.The crew were highly experienced and knowledgeable also with the various camping beaches along the way.  Each day after rafting, it was quick work to get the boats unloaded so we could get our camp sites set up while the crew set up the kitchen and restroom facilities.   The AZRA team also prepared three great meals every day- and this was not your canned meat and reconstituted eggs kind of food.  It was fresh ingredients, home style cooked, and plenty to go around.  We also had great desserts  each day!On our hike out, we had two additional AZRA team members who ensured we had plenty of snacks, water and electrolytes.  We hiked the entire upper half with one of them, and she was also very knowledgeable of the canyon and pointed out some interesting sites along the way.This was the best camping trip I've ever had!  Both the camaraderie of our fellow travelers, and the great AZRA team made the trip fun and memorable.   We definitely recommend AZRA and plan to do  another trip with them in the future.Thanks so much to Jed, Michele, Jody, Claire, Aaron, Dirk, Helen, and Lisa!  Hope to see you again in the future!"
94,8 Day Motor Adventure leaving 5/16/16 for 8 days,"When my husband and I announced our intention to join Arizona Raft Adventures on an eight day motorized trip through the Grand Canyon the responses from our families and friends ranged from “Wow” to “are you crazy?”  At age 62 and 63 our response to the latter was “maybe”.  But it was the adventure of a lifetime.  One that we plan to repeat.  With AZRA.Our crew: Dave, Jeff and Kara, were excellent.  From piloting the boat-to informing us on geology to- holding our hands when needed on hikes-to cooking fantastic meals-to reading bedtime stories after dinner, they saw to our safety, comfort and enjoyment over 225 river miles.  If you can't live for 8 days without flush toilets, icy drinks, showers and plush mattresses might I suggest a luxury cruise?  But if you need a chance to truly experience the thrill and peace of nature in its full splendor try the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.  There are toilet seats on the cans you pee in.  Canned drinks can be cooled in the river.  A cold shower (no soap allowed) under a waterfall is pure joy on a hot day.  And it is very easy to fall asleep on a foam pad in the sand under a glorious display of stars.  Throw in majestic canyon walls, rapids that run from bumps to roller coasters, your first sighting of a Bighorn in all his glory, the awesome beauty of the aquamarine water in Havasu Creek and, for me, AZRA and the Grand Canyon win hands down."
95,A really great adventure,"My Dad and I chose the 14 day dory trip to get a feel for how boats were run long ago through the Canyon.  We booked a year in advance and were not disappointed.  And as it happened, it fell over my birthday this year even better!  There were three dories and three oar rafts.  About 25 people total between guides and guests.  Food was superb from salmon and steaks for dinner plus eggs to order and biscuits and gravy for breakfast and lots of deli selections for lunch, we didn't go hungry.  And who would think a chocolate cake with frosting was possible for a birthday cake while camping!  AZRA made it happen.All hikes were amazing, but caution is necessary due to some exposure and creek crossings.  The guides were always present to lend a helping hand and nobody was left behind.Be prepared for hot weather in August and the occasional monsoon storm.  We had plenty of both and remember that you will be living in sand so it is crucial to use salve on your hands and feet and to continually drink water.  Tents are provided, but we chose to sleep out every night to stargaze.To sum it up, a Grand Canyon rafting trip is unique and not for everybody, but if you have no problem camping out for two weeks, being soaked by rapids and sandblasted by the wind this is the type of adventure for you."
96,"Spectacular, fun experience.  First class operation.","There are few places in the world where you can see rocks that are a billion years old, experience numerous white water rapids and hike into beautiful side canyons.  Only about 750,000 people have rafted the Grand Canyon, so you would be one in a million if you embark on this adventure.  For me, this was an opportunity to experience God's handiwork at its finest.  Our excursion lasted 16 days, and was over far too soon.  The river guides were extremely knowledgeable and were upbeat throughout the entire trip.  ""White water in the morning!""  We had a guitar and several guitar players in our group, and my biggest regret was not bringing the words to music that we could sing together.  I highly recommend the Hiker's Discovery trip, though much of the hiking involves a lot of steep ascents, since you are always starting from river level.  See https://azraft.com/trip-planning/hiking/hikers-discovery/ for more details."
97,We had a great time- active all the time on a hybrid float paddle trip.,"Start with the Grand Canyon, mix in some incredible hikes, big water whitewater, good friends, and incredible guides and it certainly makes for a trip of a lifetime.  The entire AZRA staff did an incredible job to make our trip just awesome.  The guides work their tails off and love every minute of it.  They are prepared, friendly, confident and pass on these traits to us so that  we can enjoy all of the beaty that the Grand Canyon offers.  A spectacular place to go and a spectacular company to go with!"
98,8 Day Motor Adventure leaving 5/19/16 for 8 days,"A 15-day float down the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon that rivals the best vacation ever!  Quiet beauty, stunning scenery, exciting rapids and challenging hikes...not to mention incredible food!  The guides provide a wonderful background of the canyon, including history, geology and folklore.  Sleeping under a blanket of stars every night reminds one of the beauty all around.  Loved every minute!"
99,"WHAT A TRIP! 14-DAYS RIVER RAFTING, HIKING AND CAMPING ON THE COLORADO RIVER, THROUGH THE GRAND CANYON",This is an amazing place and the guides were very excited to show us around. I would recommend using AZRA as a great opportunity to learn from people who have some great experiences and awesome things to share. Additionally the food was a never ending feast.
100,"Excellence, time after time","This is the best family vacation we have ever taken.  We have had many adventures with our 5 children (4 boys, 1 girl - all teenagers), but this trip pleased everyone.  There was adventure, excitement, comraderie, beauty, etc.  We loved every minute of it!  You must enjoy camping to really thrive on this trip - you will ""wear"" river silt for the duration of the trip!  AZRA is a well organized, experienced Grand Canyon float trip operator.  All of our guides were knowledgeable about the rapids and safety as well as the history and archeology of the Grand Canyon.  Two thumbs up for AZRA and this amazing trip!!"
101,The Adventure of a Lifetime,Several of us were turning 50 and wanted to do a hybrid trip.  The guides were fantastic.  It turned out that 4 of the 5 guides were girls and they were excellent.  Very knowledgeable and great chemistry.  What a fun trip!  I highly recommend spending 14 days on a non-motorized trip to commune with the canyon.
102,Outstanding ,"Just came back from the full Canyon eight day motor trip. Two boats, 24 guests, four guides. I won't repeat all the superlatives. You can see from the reviews that no one is disappointed. Our guides were the model of calm efficiency, teamwork and energy. They were always thinking of how to best match the trip to our diverse needs and desires, Katie in particular. Here are some examples:They did an incredible job accommodating the disability of one guest. We were all very moved and pitched in to help. They let our twenty something sons ""drive"" the boat a couple times on the calm stretches. Katie broke out the guitar on a long hot afternoon, got one son to play it, got the other son to do rhythm on the water cooler and led the ladies in an impromptu dance party on the foredeck of the boat. What a hoot!  They let the boys swim through some of the tamer rapids. Not to let them have all the fun, we all joined in on the last one. They brought candles to decorate the nightly fresh baked cake, one night as a surprise for our anniversary.  Although the sound of the motor was very slight, they turned it off several times and urged us to enjoy the majesty of the deep deep silence. We could go on but you get the idea. Here are a couple things you should know about a wilderness camping expedition, but are beyond the control of any river guide:We went before the monsoon season. The river was lovely and clear. If you go during the monsoon, it can be ""too thin to plow and too thick to drink."" (Not to worry they have an elaborate water filtration system on board.)Because there was zero rain, it was HOT HOT HOT, (105 degrees plus) especially mid-day. But we all learned to keep cool by jumping in the icy water, wrapping in drenched sarongs, and getting splashed by the rapids. And there was always a breeze. Sometimes a strong breeze. Our trip leader always managed to find a sliver of overhanging shade for our lunch stop. Packing out the ""solid waste"" and using the single communal commode (""the groover"") took some getting used to but it was a small price to pay. And you will never have a commode with a better view.  Bathing in 50 degree water will take your breath away. It gets a little warmer during the last few days. The gravel Indian-reservation road out from Diamond Creek will rattle your bones. You just have to suck it up for an hour. If you can handle a few of these things, DO IT, DO IT!"
103,an unforgettable travel experience,"What an incredible way to see the Grand Canyon - from the river!  We had a star crew...including the amazing Louise Teal who wrote the book, Breaking into the Current: Boatwomen of the Grand  Canyon.  Fascinating geology, unsurpassed grandeur and knowledgeable guides made the trip terrific.  We had fun hikes to spectacular waterfalls, a float in the aqua-colored Little Colorado river, lots of rafting on oared boats & a paddle boat, geology & history of the region along with some readings by authors of the Grand Canyon.  The AZRA company did a wonderful job making the trip enjoyable for all."
104,TRIP OF A LIFETIME,"Best scenery in the world, great food, knowledgeable and helpful guides, and interesting and friendly fellow travelers.  The rapids were exciting and the hikes exhilarating.  This trip is the trip of a lifetime.  While it can be considered 'roughing it' somewhat, it isn't as rough as it sounds. The guides ensure that everything is done as safe as possible and try to make you as comfortable as they can in every aspect. Sleeping in tents or beneath the stars makes for a memorable experience.  This trip allows you to do and see things you can never experience."
105,Five Reasons to Raft the Canyon:,"Just completed my third trip - the Classic 14 day.  Previously I had done the upper and lower Classic trips in 2012 and 2014 respectively.  AzRA covers everything from soup to nuts, and after 3 trips I think I can say with full confidence that they have the best and most experienced guides in the business.  The trip is not for the faint of heart because temps can be on the high side and sleeping in blowing sand can also be a challenge, but if you are an adventurous soul, AZRA is the team for you.  It’s not just rafting, but equally a hiking adventure, but you can pick and choose whether to participate in the more rigorous hikes.  A splendid time is guaranteed for all."
106,16 Days of rafting down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon,"My first Grand Canyon raft trip was in 1996 and was with Arizona Raft Adventures. I did a throrough research of the company and they offered exactly what I wanted. Just completed my 12th trip and it was ever bit as fun as my first. The food was great  and the workers were fun and knowledgeable. Geology, history and river stories. The company offers different options depending on your level of experience. The Eight Day Motor trip was my cup of tea. I did the 13 day hybrid trip a few years ago and was glad that I did. For the money AZRA (Arizona Raft Adventures) offers something that you will never forget."
107,16 Day Classic Rafting Trip,"Ten day raft trip down the full length of the Grand Canyon with AZRA. The level of organization, service and expertise is the best I've experienced in a guiding adventure in my life. From the pre-trip planning to the trip and the post trip follow up, the AZRA crew were outstanding. Definitely two thumbs up."
108,some things not so good,"Our experience rafting the upper canyon with AZRA was excellent from beginning to end.  Booking was easy, all inquiries were answered promptly and professionally; packing lists and FAQs were extremely helpful; pre-trip orientation was through; guides were professional, competent, passionate, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and enthusiastic; the rafting was exciting; hikes were interesting, fun and challenging, leading to waterfalls, views and through side canyons; food was amazing; campsites were well located and comfortable and the hike up Bright Angel trail was long and hot, but very doable with the proper preparation and support from the guides. It was amazing to look back on our campsite and see no trace that we were there. The guides are passionate about protecting the environment and maintaining the natural environment.  If you are considering a trip down the river, I would definitely recommend going with Arizona Raft Adventures."
109,Second raft trip better than the first!,"This is my second fall Hiker's Special trip with Arizona Raft Adventures. The first time I went in 2010 I had read the website write up with some trepidation. I took their recommendations on preparation for the hiking and was rewarded both times with an outstanding experience. The trip this year started with three hikes the first day. The trip this year also included a dory which allowed us to switch from oar raft, to paddle raft, to dory during the trip. The lead guide briefed us both night and morning on the days activities, and provided multiple options on most of the hikes. Two of the hikes were all day with us going up over the rim on trails while the rafts were floated down to the meeting point. The alternatives to this were floating with the rafts and then short hikes at the end. I agree with all the positive comments on food, guide knowledge, and equipment provided. We had six vegetarians with us as well as some food allergies and everyone was happy with the provisions. Will be doing the trip again, it is offered both spring and fall when the temperatures allow the longer hikes."
110,You have to see for yourself,"This was truly a once in a lifetime trip!  The full canyon trip could not have been more spectacular.  The rapids ranged in every class, the hikes from easy to very challenging, but our incredible guides helped us to see the canyon from every angle!  They were knowledgeable about every aspect and taught us tons of history, geology, and folklore.  Spectacular views at every turn, including sleeping under the stars at night!  Highly recommend this outfitter and the trip itself!"
111,Two Week All Paddle Grand Canyon Trip is Amazing,"We spent six glorious days on the Colorado River with Arizona Raft (AzRaft).  Our guides had extraordinary in depth knowledge of the history and geology.  They were wonderful.  I have done a fair amount of white water rafting and I have never seen such large waves as we experienced on the river.  The Azraft guides got us safely down that beautiful wonderful river.  What was especially important is how well the company prepared us for our hike out.  That was a challenge, but with the proper preparation it was another extraordinary aspect of this dazzling vacation."
112,15 Day Trip Dory Trip,"We arranged a charter 8 day, 7 night motorized trip down the Grand Canyon with Arizona Rafters and had an incredible time.Of course the scenery was amazing.  The guides, Laura, Al, Amanda and Newt were incredible.  The food was fantastic, gourmet.... and the side hikes were great.It exceeded our expectations.  We didn't have to think about anything!!!... just be disconnected from the world and relax and enjoy the experience.Dan and Georgana Finn"
113,"Oh, So Memorable!","My experiences with AzRA have never disappointed me. The overall experience is truely awesome.  From the first contact the customer service is considerate and friendly.  The guides are knowlegable, professional, safety oriented and fun.  The food is incredible and always more than enough.   And what other location can measure up to the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River.......very very few indeed.  I would encourage anyone to take a ""run thru the ditch"".  By the way, I have a physical limitation in my left leg --- the guides were more than accommodating to ensure both my safety and my enjoyment throughout the entire 14 days."
114,Experience of a Lifetime!,"For his 60th a friend threw himself a party like no other and invited friends and family on an AZRA ""Classic Adventure"" trip down the Upper Canyon. It was wonderful in all possible ways. The scenery always stunning at any time of day, the rafting a lot of fun and hiking side canyons exciting. The guides all were professional, knowledgeable about the canyon, intuitive to our group and genuinely good, fun people! The hike out via the Bright Angel Trail is challenging with stunning views. Age range of our group was 14 to 65+"
115,"scotsman on tour, trip of a lifetime","Wonderful!  Ten day motorized Colorado River trip through the Grand Canyon with the Grand Canyon Field Institute.  Azra boatsman and assistant? the greatest!  Food? Too much, too good!. Sleeping arrangements?  wide open."
116,Cliches ahead:  Trip of a Lifetime!,We took the 14 day full Canyon trip. The Upper part shows the unfolding geological story whilst some of the best rapids were on the lower part. The staff could not have been more helpful or knowledgeable. The food was fantastic and freshly prepared.Would certainly recommend if you want to see the Grand Canyon!
117,9 day trip from Bright Angel Trail,"8 day motor trip.  many good things about it, that other reviews have said.   but:  you have to work when you get to camp.  no relaxing, must unload the rafts. you must scramble to find a spot to sleep in and they are mostly far from the kitchen.  you have to be fast to get a place that's level and not full of boulders.  sometimes it is a workout to get to the ""toilets"".  many times we wanted to go, but kids were playing next to it or someone was hiking to a spot where he could look down at them.  women may find it annoying to see the men peeing right in front of them by the river.  and they have to look hard to find a place to pee that's discreet.  I agree that the guides seemed a little burned out.  they really had to work during the whole trip.  be aware if you like it peaceful on the river, you may be with a bunch of rowdy people.  on my trip quiet people were on one raft and the rowdies were on the other one.   in the morning, you have to load al the boats up again.  they say you don't have to help do this loading and unloading, but are you going to be the only lazy one who does not help?  another thing, it is HOT at night.....we had many sleepless hours waiting for the rocks to cool off.  you DON'T need 2 water bottles.   Oh, if you have to do poops in the middle of the day, you are on the ""naughty"" list.  I felt really bad when one of us had to go poopy mid-day on 3 different days and it was obvious  the guide  was really annoyed."
118,Blue Grass and Rafting trip,"Simply stated, the 8 day motor trip with Matt, Sommer, David, Simone and Julia was outstanding!!  The side canyon adventures were incredible.  Sommer and Julia led ""the Adventure Club"" stemming/chimneying up Matkatamiba canyon.  The AzRA trip guides were knowledgeable about the geology and culture of the canyon.  They love sharing the canyon with others.  We appreciated that the guides let the participants set their own limits for the hikes.AzRA is top notch.  Sign up for any of their trips.  They are OUTSTANDING!!"
119,Trip of a lifetime (Part IV),"Just returned from the 13 day excursion down the Colorado.  The beauty of the Grand Canyon was simply amazing and there are many memories we will treasure for the remainder of our lives.  Equally amazing was the warmth, expertise and amenities shared with us by the five guides from AzRA throughout the trip.  We have rafted with other outfitters in the past but the AzRA guides stand in a class of their own.  Their attention to every detail from setting up camps, explaining the geology and history of the Canyon, the incredible food served each day and tending to our everyday needs was awesome.  We knew at all times we were in good hands and were never disappointed with any of our activities and experiences.   I highly recommend this trip and thank the entire AzRA team for making this so memorable."
120,My favorite trip ever,"Just completed the 10-day lower half trip.  OUTSTANDING trip, guides, and group.  Team Leader Jed was great.  Knowledgeable, calm, cool, and collected.  The other guides; Zach, Gregg, Astrid, Joy, and Jacob along with Emily and Julian were equally outstanding.  Had done the upper half two years ago.  This was even more exciting!  Highly recommend d AzRA.  Top notch operation."
121,Everything on our bucket list!,"AZRA provided the rafting / camping services on support of a photo-tour in Grand Canyon. From the first moment that we arrived in Flagstaff to the moment we finally said goodbye, their staff were attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and concerned to ensure that we all had a great trip Their number one focus was on our safety and comfort, both on the raft and during our many hikes and explorations. They were prepared for contingencies and effortlessly arranged the evacuation of a fellow-traveler who was unwell. They had a great focus on food and personal hygiene, but at the same time, kept it all light-hearted and fun. Their equipment was all workmanlike, clean and well-maintained. Their boatmanship was excellent and they never tired of telling us about the Canyon and what we were seeing."
122,14 Day Classic Adventure,"We recently took an 8-day motorized rafting trip with a teenager and preteen with AzRA (AzRaft). Truth be told, my teenager was very reluctant to go. However, 1 hour into the trip, he was smiling ear to ear, laughing, and clearly having an incredible time. It was the trip of a lifetime for all of us, and it's almost impossible for any description to give credence to it. I'll try to cover a few highlights. First, I'll address my pre-trip concerns. Safety was my main pre-trip concern. AzRA has an impeccable safety record, and there was not a time in which we did not feel safe. The guides were well trained and kept a close eye on all of us. No one came close to falling out of the rafts, yet the rapids were thrilling and fun. I do not ride roller coasters (though one of my children does), and we all thoroughly enjoyed the rapids but also felt safe. I was also concerned about how we would do in such hot temperatures. We stuck to the AzRA recommendations for what to bring, and bought a number of items from their store. As a result, the heat was no problem since we had the right clothes and equipment (the right salve, water bottles, tee shirts, etc). The guides made sure we were kept hydrated with treated water and other beverages as well as cool by the river water. I chose AzRA over other companies for a number of reasons. One was that the 8-day motorized trip allowed us to traverse the length of the Grand Canyon yet also have time to explore the canyon in other ways. I am grateful for making this choice. As other companies' rafts whizzed by us, spending the vast majority of their days in the raft, having to traverse the same distance in only 5 or 6 days, we got to enjoy exploring some side canyon hikes and swimming in some of the tributaries. These side trips were among the top highlights of our trip.AzRA guides are well versed in Grand Canyon geology, history, river stories, flora, and fauna. This was our head guide's 164th rafting trip through the Grand Canyon, and he had a wealth of knowledge with a keen ability to keep all of us engaged with stories and information. Very importantly, our AzRA guides specialize in the Grand Canyon segment of the Colorado River. They know every nook and cranny of the 220+ miles. And, they took great care of us. They worked extremely hard and long hours, all very cheerfully, and made us always feel like we were their number one concern. The food was amazing!! Healthy and plentiful. We never came close to feeling hungry, and I was astounded how even on the 8th day we were eating fresh vegetables and fruit. Three other clients on our trip were a among a group of friends who commonly travel with each other and who are also National Park Service employees (and somewhat high ranking) from parks in other states. One of them had done a lot of comparisons of different companies, and chose AzRA. To me, that was impressive. Not only did we enjoy getting to know the other clients and becoming a ""tribe"" with them, our family also created some of the nicest, most fun memories. From rafting over thrilling rapids, to floating down tributaries arm in arm, to cheering my preteen on her first big hike, to lying on the sand under the stars together and picking out some constellations - we will cherish these memories forever. If you're wondering whether or not to do a Grand Canyon rafting trip, most likely the answer should be ""yes!"". It is a physical and spiritual journey, too complicated to fully explain here. Seeing pictographs and other Native American ancient artifacts in the Canyon, descending to some of the earliest known exposed earth almost 2 billion years old, and sleeping out under the skies with clear views of the Milky Way, all give one pause to contemplate one's role in this infinity. Living comfortably in a tribe of sorts with ~20 other human beings for 8 days without a watch, phone, internet, or email makes one wonder about the costs to our human relationships of these modern ""conveniences"" If you go on this trip, do expect to be changed in more ways than one. As our guide said, ""the river is reality; modern life is unreality"". And for me, Norman Maclean's quote now carries a lot more meaning. ""Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.” Thank you, AzRA!!"
123,Get ready for the trip of a lifetime,"I cannot say enough about how great this trip was. We are a family with very diverse interests, and yet each and every one of us found something to love about this trip. My sixteen year old daughter who ""hates the outdoors"" ended up hiking and rowing, and my twelve year old son who usually has only one speed (fast!) actually slowed down long enough to listen to stories about geology.  The guides were incredibly friendly and professional, the food was amazing, and of course, the setting was perfect.  I waited years to be able to see the Grand Canyon this way, and will never be satisfied with just looking over the edge again.  I know that there are other reputable companies that raft the canyon, but I am convinced that AZRA was the best possible choice we could have made.  I highly recommend this trip."
124,"Incredible, unforgettable and loved every minute of it!","My experience setting up this trip for 20 friends and family started with Megan at the head office a year before departure.  Her patience, knowledge, availability and professionalism were excellent.  I wish that I could have thanked her in person.Once on the river our lead guide Omar and his band of merry men and women (Dottie, Liz, Steph, Patrick and John) truly made the trip something special.  They were hardworking, professional, educational, entertaining and friendly.   As a two time private boater in the canyon I was reluctant to embrace the commercial option but with our group of none boaters this time it was the only option.  Not regrets.  I will recommend this trip to any of my boating friends. The trip definitely exceeded my expectations."
125,The Grand Canyon by boat,"My wife and I just returned from an Upper Canyon all paddle trip with AZRA. Words can hardly describe the Canyon and the experience. This organization is FIRST CLASS all the way. Our raft guides Patrick, Wes and Tommy were PHENOMENAL!! Many thanks to guides, Finger, Mershan, Tyler & Tom Jones too. Everyone from AZRA is ALL IN on making this trip the best one of your life. We have been on many adventures and this one was right at the very top. They have many surprises in store for you, so I won't divulge them here, although Tommy's ""river cake"" was an experience not to miss.Listening to the guitar on the river or around our pseudo-campfire to the knowledgable discussions about the rock formations and history of the Canyon were only a part of days filled with excitement, fun and laughter. Awesome hikes, phenomenal food and great company.We gazed at the stars at night and even saw the milky way. We hiked out the Bright Angel Trail and met Fred at Indian Gardens. My wife was struggling with the heat, but it was Fred who helped her through with his encouragement, canyon & wildlife stories and the occasional bottle of water dumped over her head and shoulders.There is never a dull moment with AZRA and we would HIGHLY recommend them. I am already planning the next trip and it will definitely be with the AZRA team!"
126,Grand Canyon Rafting,"My teenage daughter and I've been on a 6 days classical rafting tour of the upper canyon with AzRA. The experience of going down into earth history was absolutely great. The guides were fantastic, knowledgable and took good care of us. Everything was extremely well organized, the food excellent and going through the rapids was really exciting. Hiking out of the Grand Canyon to Grand Canyon Village was somewhat  torturous but we made it!!!!! It is absolutely worth going, I highly recommend this trip and there is a high chance of doing the lower part of the canyon at some point."
127,Everything was done to a very high standard.,Our family had a great time getting to float down the river and see all the beautiful sights. Staff was lovely and charismatic and kept us all safe. Such a fun day!
128,MORE STARS !!!,"I should preface that my girlfriend and I have traveled many places around the world, and our river trip with AZ Raft Adventures was probably our most fun trip of all time. The food is excellent, the guides are amazing, the canyon is beautiful and the fellow travelers are cool. We can't say enough great things about them. You have to experience it for yourself. It really is the trip of a lifetime!"
129,Experience of a lifetime!,"What a trip. Four of our family members booked a motorized rafting trip with AzRA which I will remember for a life time. Amazing rapids, refreshingly beautiful waterfalls and breathtaking views. You really haven't seen the Grand Canyon unless you have rafted in the Grand Canyon. AzRA give top notch service from the orientation, the guides, food and overall experience.  I would book them again in a heart beat."
130,AzRA is the best!,"We were on the 8 day motor trip which John B. reviewed and agree with him on all points.  Fabulous experience.  The Grand Canyon is amazing and AZRA is a first class company that knows how to get you through it.  Guides were wonderful, very knowledgeable and friendly and the food was amazingly good.  I think the 8 day trip was a perfect length and don't see the benefit of the longer, oar boat trip.  A cautionary point: you do have to be reasonably fit, willing to sleep on the ground, pee in the river, etc. but I did not find anything to be too challenging and I am so glad that I did it. I'll remember the experience for the rest of my life."
131,Fabulous Outfitter,"The rafting trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon with Arizona Rafting Company was the best!  The crew was absolutely wonderful--very knowledgeable and experienced, helpful and upbeat.   Although each crew member had their own special interests and areas of expertise they worked together as a team in every way--from paddling, hiking and educating us about our surroundings to cooking absolutely fantastic meals.  It was a memorable trip in every way and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in getting off the grid and interacting with nature and the unsurpassable beauty of the Grand Canyon."
132,8-day rafting trip down the Colorado River with BOW,"Has to be one of the best experiences of my life. From the natural beauty of the Grand Canyon seen close up to the high caliber river guides, Well organized, great food, sleeping out under the stars (and full moon). Good instructional info about the geology and history of the canyon. The rapids are not bad in the motorized rafts.  Best of all for me were the hikes up the side canyons to 'play' in the waterfalls."
133,8 Days on the Colorado River - 5/5 Stars,"Did the 9-day Lower Canyon all paddle trip leaving in early July. I couldn't recommend this trip or AZRA as a company any more. In general, I'd say the two things that surprised me the most was the variety of landscapes in the canyon and the differences between our days. Some days we paddled more, some days we hiked more, every day was spectacular. If you are healthy and fit, I also definitely recommend the all-paddle trip. It attracts an adventurous crowd as a whole and I think it allowed us to take some longer hikes and explore a little more. You also seriously bond with the other people on the trip as you work together to go through some seriously big water.The canyon is always going to be spectacular, but I think a few things set AZRA apart as a company:1) The Guides-- Our trip was led by Kevin, the other two paddle captains were Joy and Lynn, and the support boats were rowed by Kevin, Claire, and Doty. Each and every one of them was incredible. They all added something different, but in general, they were personable, fun, and, best of all, incredibly knowledgeable about the canyon. They could discuss geology, botany, history, and more at length. On the rare occasion they didn't know something, they would ask around or reference a book and get back to you. Couldn't recommend them more.2) The pre-trip support- AZRA provides a ton of documentation to help you get ready and purchase supplies for the trip. Every time you call, you are able to reach an actual human who will happily answer any questions.3) Attention to detail- They think about pretty much everything. Storing a suitcase for the course of the trip, recommending restaurants for post-trip dinner, bringing supplies to the pre-trip meeting for those who forgot to purchase something, and more. In general, I couldn't have felt more taken care of throughout.4) The food- I have no way of knowing how other outfitters feed you, but I can tell you that I absolutely enjoyed every meal that I had on the trip and even asked for a few of the recipes. Most luxurious ""camping"" meals that I've ever had.If you are thinking of taking a Grand Canyon trip with AZRA, do it. You won't regret a thing."
134,"All Paddle trip!  Wet, wild, way fun!","I went with the group of 25 veterans a couple weeks ago and had a blast.  The guides knew everything and were excellent hosts.  We ate like kings and got to sample every aspect of the canyon I was interested in, from side canyons and waterfalls to ruins and even a helicopter medevac when one of our teammates felt sick.  Jay, Owen, and Liam, you guys are amazing and I have been recommending you three and your organization to a lot of people ever since we said our farewells.  I hope to return soon and several times.  Hats off to you all."
135,8-day motor trip,"My husband and i did a 8 day motorized trip down the entire river.  This one was of the best experiences of my life.  I had never even been camping.  Everything was fabulous, The guides were skilled and knowledgeable.  The hikes were challenging but breath taking.  We slept under the stars and ate the most wonderful food.  Time did. not exist and for the first time I feel I literally was living in the moment.   I had researched many companies and azra was hands down the best.  A nice respite from the crazy world we are currently living in.  I can not say enough good things about this trip, the guides and my fellow rafters."
136,AZRA Colorado River Adventure,"My two week trip was planned over a year in advance and as the date approached I wondered if it would live up to the rather high expectations that had developed in the months leading up to it. It exceeded them in every way. AZRA was professional and well organized from the orientation the night before the trip through the return to Flagstaff.     As expected, the scenery was spectacular throughout. It's impossible to describe the feeling of being immersed in a Canyon that, while young in geological terms, is essentially unchanged since we began walking the earth.       Our six guides were extremely professional and provided a wealth of knowledge about the history and geology of the Canyon. Their enthusiasm of what they do was obviously and it was clear they enjoyed sharing their enjoyment of the Canyon with the group. They did and outstanding job of instilling a feeling of togetherness as we all shared the tasks of setting up and breaking down our daily camps as the river became a greater part of our lives each day.      The guides also did a superb job of knowing what each passenger could handle physically as they led us on side hikes each day ranging from quiet strolls to physically strenuous and at times hair raising experiences. Thanks to their encouragement and assistance I was able to cover terrain l may not have tackled on my own.     I'd chosen the latter part of July because I'd been told the weather can be more variable during the monsoon season and the AZRA person l spoke with when making the reservation was right on the mark with that advice. We dealt with temperatures over 100 each day though as our paddle captain Steve joked ""If you're hot on the river you're stupid"" and the first rapid each day gave us a chilly wake up call. We also got to experience tent flattening winds some nights as well as some serious downpours that sent water cascading down the Canyon walls as different waterfalls formed and then vanished following the rains.     Afternoons spent relaxing in the shade of slot canyons provided a sense of serenity that could only be found as a result of being totally detached from the outside world.     Fortunately, l was able to spend some additional time out west visiting our son following the trip so it eased the transition from river time to the ""real world"".      Several of the folks on our trip had been through the Canyon multiple times and at first I couldn't understand as there are so many things I'd like to see in my retirement years. Now I can hardly wait to return.     Thanks AZRA for making was was planned as the trip of a lifetime into two weeks unlike anything l've experienced."
137,Great time,"Just took a 6 day hybrid rafting trip with AZRA.  This is a top notch outfitter.  Very professional guides.  Jerry, Summer, Kelly, Nate and Billy were the best.  Highly recommend AZRA to anyone thinking of doing a rafting trip through the grand canyon.  And a river trip is the best way to see the canyon.  Great food, awsome hikes and fun guides.  You cannot go wrong with AZRA"
138,Great 8 day motorized trip,"We just completed our 4th trip thru the canyon this past August, all of them with AzRA ( Arizona Raft Adventures ). Needless to say, they are the premier outfitter for a Grand Canyon River adventure.I have said it before: if you are reading this, you are probably getting serious about a river trip. I can't adequately describe the experience, but I can say: Do it. It WILL be life changing. How many Caribbean cruises can you say that about? You are going to invest a lot of time and money, so my advise is to cut out the stress and book with AzRA. Think about it: running whitewater in the GRAND CANYON, sleeping under the stars, enjoying the company of a couple of dozen people that share your sense of adventure and love of nature. We have had 4 memorable trips with AzRA, and can't wait to do it again."
139,Great 10 day motorized raft trip,"… And you'll want to do it more than once. These guys are the best. Professionals at what they do, they convey a deep love for the canyon and a respect for its resources. They cook great meals and make for a thrilling but comfortable off the grid experience."
140,AZRA Delivers on Powerful Grand Canyon Adventure,"OUTSTANDING!  This is how I describe my rafting adventure with AzRA.  There is no detail missed from the initial sign-up through the last day of departure.  Everything is top shelf.  The guides were extraordinary, knowledgable, and awesome rafters.  Anyone who goes I would STRONGLY encourage you to sign up to paddle.  What a blast!  The food was unbelievable.  The ONLY way to really see the Grand Canyon is though a trip with AzRA.  I will definitely be signing up ASAP for the lower half trip to complete my journey."
141,Terrific company for a river trip,"These guys were top notch. They know how to ensure you get the best possible experience in the Canyon. We were there for a late May, paddle and oar, 9-day lower canyon trip. Everything was amazing. Our group passed a few other trips from other companies along the way. There's no doubt that I made the right decision on which company to use."
142,Grand Canyon Exploration/Hiking Adventure,"We just returned from a 9-day trip with ArZA that began with hiking down the Bright Angel Trail from the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and included 9 days on the Colorado River, paddling, exploring side canyons with spectacular trails and waterfalls, camping on beautiful beaches and having an extraordinary time all the way to Diamond Creek.ArZA river guides are fabulous -- knowledgeable about the river, the canyon and its history and folklore. They are expert boatmen, wonderful teachers, great cooks, fabulous storytellers and so much fun.Want an unforgettable trip of the lifetime? Take a trip with ArZA through the Grand Canyon!"
143,This is not a day trip!,"I went on the 8 day motorised trip. It was the most incredible experience of my life. The guides were exceptional with their knowledge of the river, cooking expertise and general easy to get along with. I travelled from Australia with some work colleagues and had no expectations apart from to view the scenery and just enjoy the break. It was so much more. I will definitely be back with friends and family."
144,AZRA....Simply the best!!!,"This outfitter is a real class act!  We went on the June 6 lower canyon trip and can't say enough about the experience.  From our guide down the Bright Angel trail to the bus driver back to Flagstaff, everything was flawlessly organized.  This is a life changing trip.  It is worth every penny.Our lead guide, Owen, did a fantastic job.  Our other guides were superb too.  Their humor, knowledge, and work ethic were great.  Alan kept us in stiches with his jokes and stories.  Liam did a fantastic job leading the kids around in the rubber kayaks.  I can't say enough about Kevin, John, Alexis, and Andrew.  How an organization can keep such top notch people is amazing.The food, while not gourmet, was delicious.  How we were still eating fresh fruit and vegetables 12 days into a trip was incredible.  We did not have a bad meal the entire time.The Grand Canyon speaks for itself.  There is not a more beautiful place in this country nor a better way to see it.  While it was hot (105 degrees) and the river was cold (55 degrees), the trip was still comfortable.  The side trips/hikes were all perfect.  The rafting was thrilling, fun, and completely safe.Other stuff:  The 8.5 mile hike down the Bright Angel trail was difficult but doable if you are any semblance of good shape.  Get used to the sand.  The first day/night is was bothersome and annoying.  The second day just annoying.  By the third day you stopped noticing it.  Have some good river sandals or shoes.  Several people had foot problems from the sand rubbing from the inside."
145,A Once in a Lifetime Trip,"If you are considering booking a trip with AZRA, stop reading right now and book it! We had high expectations for this trip, but all of our hopes and dreams were far exceeded by this amazing company and crew. We just finished a 9-day Classic Lower Canyon trip, which involved oar rafts and paddle rafts. We did a combination of both, deciding day to day how we wanted to experience the river.There are many unknowns leading up to a trip like this. What will the people be like? Why do they keep suggesting I sleep under the stars instead of a tent? Where will I do my no. 2's? All of these fears and unknowns are answered on the trip as if you knew what to do all along. The guides and assistants on are trip were caring and accommodating and really worked to help our group become a ""tribe,"" work together, help each other, and get in touch with the indescribable majesty of the Grand Canyon.If you give in and have an experience like ours, mental clutches of work, life and social media will be released during your time with AZRA. If you are introverts like us, you will find that the people in your group become like family and conversation is invigorating and not draining like it can be in the doldrums of day to day existence in the ""real world."" Your mind may be quieted and you may forget what day of the week it is, what time it is, and what troubles you have left behind. Most of all, adventure is yours to take. Beautiful hikes and excursions only accessible from the river will be available to you. The guides will help you through challenges you never thought you could face. Your other tribe members will lift you up if you need a push to get up that steep cliff. You will see beautiful, amazing places that I hesitate to describe here for fear of spoiling the surprise. The guides will take you through exciting river rapids and calm floating days where you can breath in the surroundings, spot a big-horned sheep or peregrine falcon, or get to know your tribe members on a deeper level.If this review leaves you with more questions, do not hesitate to contact the AZRA staff in advance. They are extremely helpful. I also highly recommend their Facebook page. They have several videos and tips that helped us get a better understanding of what we would experience on the trip.We would return to the Grand Canyon with AZRA in a heartbeat. We are very grateful to the company and our guides and assistants for this amazing experience."
146,AzRA ROCKS the Canyon,"Canyon Rafting: Why you need to go back again:We just returned from our 6th trip on the Colorado River thru the Grand Canyon. Of course, all of them have been with Arizona Raft Adventures (AzRA). They are a premiere rafting outfitter, so choosing them is a no brainer. They cover every aspect and have decades of experience on the river. The most common question we get is “why so many return trips?” For many people, a Canyon adventure is a once in a lifetime experience. But for a growing number of adventurers like us, once is not enough. A second or third trip offers an opportunity for a deeper (pardon the pun) Canyon experience. The view from the bottom up is almost overwhelming on your first trip, and the rapids will literally take your breath away. But a second trip, with its familiarities, opens up a whole new experience. You appreciate the serenity of being deep in the natural world. The weather (hot, cold, wet, dry) is no longer an obstacle, but is an integral part of the natural experience. Getting by with a minimum of amenities begins to make so much sense. When you return to your everyday life, you will question why you have so much unnecessary “stuff”. The deep dark starry skies become an obsession that you cannot recreate above the rim. Most of all, the people you share this adventure with will enrich your life. A river trip involves a couple of dozen people all banded together for an experience like no other on earth: enjoying the discovery of the Canyon, watching out for each other, and rejoicing in a common spirit of community. I guess that’s why we have returned so many times.Since this is a travel advice site, I need to mention a recent discovery: send your gear down to the river on a mule. If you want an option other than the full two week trip, you can hike down the Bright Angel trail for a nine day adventure. The hike isn’t easy but it is manageable if you use the mule service to carry your load. If you are packing in yourself, a backpack, water, and a minimum of clothes and gear for the week will amount to about 20+ pounds. We have done it several times but the 7.5 mile hike has become more than our old legs can handle with a heavy pack. The mule service has open up a whole new opportunity for us older adventurers. We carry a light pack with a couple quarts of water, PB&J sandwiches, apples, salty snacks and a cheap rain poncho (your good raingear is heavy and goes down with the mule). The hike is tolerable with 5 pounds as opposed to 20+."
147,Great trip!  But not for everyone...,"Rafting the Grand Canyon is definitely a challenge for which one must be well prepared.  I must say that our guides carefully instructed us on what to expect and demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the canyon.  They really worked hard to feed us and care for us.  This was my first ever rafting trip so I really can't compare it with any others or with other companies.  I read Jackel55's review with the concerns about alcohol in the canyon.  The reviewer does raise some valid points about safety and alcohol; however, I can't say that alcohol was abused on our trip.  Yes, the guides did enjoy some brews, but they didn't over do it, nor did any guests.  I will rate AZRA highly based on the hard work and knowledge of the guides, their concern for our safety, and their attention to our needs."
148,What can I say???,"We did the upper half ""classic"" trip that included a you-paddle raft as well as the oar rafts. Wow did we have a wonderful time! Green, green river, red rocks, cacti in bloom, breathtaking hikes...I could go on and on. The weather was perfect so we slept out under the stars most nights and could wake up a see the moon shadows move across the canyon. In the morning canyon wrens sang us awake. Our guides were fun and had deep experience on the river and shared their knowledge with us (when we asked). The hike up the Bright Angel Trail was easier than expected and it was just amazing to keep looking back down toward the river as you get higher and higher and the canyon area opens up more and more so that you can appreciate the vastness of this special place. Yes, do this trip."
149,"Fantastic ""Classic"" style trip - Upper Half 8/21-2/26","We went on the upper Canyon hybrid trip, where we had one peddle and 4 ore rafts. We absolutely loved it! The trip in it-self, probably, no matter what company you go with, is just absolutely amazing, but if you go with AZRA you will love it even more. They were extremely helpful, the main tour guide (Jeff) was very knowledgeable about the canyon geology and history. They cooked awesome food, and made our time extra special while we were there. We loved our trip so much, we want to go back for the full canyon trip one day. When we decide to go we will go with AZRA."
150,How do I get rid of all this damn sand???,"Yes, all of the things that have been written are true - the beauty of the canyon, the exhilaration of the rapids, disconnecting from cell phones - it was an unparallelled experience. However I must say that it wouldn't have been nearly as special without the wonderful AzRA guides - we built wonderful connections and learned great information from people with expertise in geology, ethnology-botany, and the history of the local Native American tribes. I'd recommend not only the trip but this company in particular."
151,8 day motor trip full canyon,"I did the bottom 9 days, joining the rest of my crew who did 14 days.  We loved our guides.  They were fun, knowledgeable, safe.  They taught us lots about geology, history, water, rafting.  The food was amazing.  The front office was easy to deal with.  I would do this again."
152,Knowledgeable Guides insured our safety,"Arizona Raft Adventures (AzRA) is a first class Grand Canyon raft trip outfitter in my opinion.  The staff members are all warm, friendly, helpful, and ""companionable"", from back office folks who handle reservations and such thru orientation folks who conduct the pre-trip training sessions, to the guides (captains, pilots, raft drivers, whatever)  who take you down the river.  The guides are experienced (our primary guide was making his 226th Canyon trip) and knowledgeable.  During quiet river sections they taught us (at least those who wanted to listen) about the geology, the history, some of the people who were important in the history, the wildlife we saw, and generally kept us entertained while educating us.  Very good!       Although AzRA is first class, with excellent food and very good accommodations, this trip is not for everybody.  Each evening my brother and I would comment on how happy we were that WE were on the trip and how happy we were that our wives were NOT on the trip!  (My wife regards Holiday Inn Express as ""roughing it"".)  To illustrate, the Park Service requires, very reasonably I think, that everything that's brought in to the Canyon must be taken out.  One implication, for example:  one must poop in a pot (actually, a bucket with a toilet seat on top) which is taken along and out of the Canyon.  Now, the guides locate this ""groover"" as it's called (older versions had no seat and left temporary grooves in one's backside) in scrub brush away from camp, out of sight, usually with a nice view of the river, all of which is good.  But one is still pooping in a pot.  And one must pee in the river, leading to some very amusing behaviors in a group with both men and women.  Not for everyone.     Please carefully consider the type of raft/length of trip that's best for you.  I took a motorized raft (that moves right along in the ""flat"" sections of the river) for an 8-day trip.  Paddled (non-motorized) rafts may be more alluring to some folks but the trip is longer, around 14 days or so.  I love the outdoors and I loved the trip but 8 days was just about right for me and most of the people on our trip.     Plan to be incommunicado (no cell phone coverage, for example) for essentially the whole trip.  The AzRA guides carry a satellite phone for emergencies -- but only for real emergencies.       AzRA also provides great materials, instructions, etc., to help one prepare for the trip and friendly folks who answer questions over the phone.     I can't compare AzRA with other Canyon outfitters because I have no experience with them.   We selected AzRA based on recommendations from an Idaho rafting outfitter and TripAdvisor and other reviews.  On the river the other outfitters seemed to be doing a good job and their guests seemed (from a distance) to be happy enough.       That said, I think AzRA did a great job and their staff is excellent from every perspective.  Highly recommended!"
153,AZRA not recommended,"Rafting on the Classic,14-rafting trip was about the most fun I have had in a long time. AZRA made everything so easy, from the hotel accommodations, to keeping my luggage stored. The guides were knowledgeable about geology, history, native peoples, Their skill and experience gave me confidence that I was in good hands at all time. I especially loved the side canyon hikes and swims. Even in record heat and an incredible wind storm, the guides kept positive. No one seemed left out. I went on the trip by myself, and felt part of the family very quickly. Thank-you for a wonderful adventure."
154,Great Experience with Arizona Raft Adventures,"... And this is from somebody who travels around the world! I've always wanted to raft the Grand Canyon, and I finally did it! It was amazing - better than I had ever imagined. My sister and brother-in-law went with AzRA 3-4 years ago and recommended them highly. We were impressed with their website, pre-trip responsiveness, and amount of information provided. Then, on the river they more than lived up to our high expectations. The guides were incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, professional, and helpful. And the food ... to die for! OMG - amazing what they could do out there, with so many fresh ingredients and such variety.This is such a worthwhile adventure, and the cost seems very reasonable for everything you get. The best part to me was the peace and quiet, drifting down the river, and especially lying under the stars at night listening to the river or first thing in the morning watching the sunrise illuminate the canyon walls and listening to the canyon wrens ... with no sights or sounds of modern hubbub. Of course, the rapids were exciting and fun, and we went on some gorgeous side hikes, often to beautiful clear springs or waterfalls. It was wonderful. I would recommend AzRA and a GC raft trip with no hesitation.We went on an 8-day motorized full-canyon trip. There are also full- and half-canyon paddle and hybrid trips you can choose from. We found the motorized trip to be ideal, as you get to see more of the canyon in less time and have plenty of time and flexibility for other activities like the hikes. The motors were not noisy or annoying; they just help you get through the still patches without having to work so hard. They can also carry more on the big motorized rafts, like thick, comfortable sleeping mats and chairs."
155,What a great trip!,"Just returned from a 14-day rafting trip with AZRA [Arizona Raft Adventures] through the Grand Canyon.  My head is still spinning with the awesomeness of this adventure--it was truly the trip of a lifetime.  The whole operation--from reservations, to advance information, to trip preparation, to the actual running of the trip itself--is A-1. It is thoroughly professional without being stuffy.  The guides were highly competent and well-prepared, as well as being highly knowledgeable about the geology and the history of our surroundings. They took us on wonderful side trips--hikes up to waterfalls and slot canyons, and they accommodated various levels of participants' abilities with grace and good humor.  They emphasized safety above all but also encouraged us to stretch and do things we didn't think we could and helped the group bond in a positive and constructive way. Guides were both male and female--which added a good gender balance and contributed to the highly positive atmosphere of the trip.  Food was excellent and well-prepared.  Campsites each night were beautiful and right on the river. I can't say enough good things about this trip and the AZRA operation.  I will be returning and bringing more friends with me."
156,What a great family experience!,"We did an 11-day motorized tour and it was the best. We had plenty of time for hikes everyday and the guides were extremely knowledgeable regarding geology, flora and fauna. I learned so much and enjoyed every minute."
157,"wonderful trip, fantastic company","We traveled for 8 days on a raised raft through the Grand Canyon carrying everything with us. The guides/pilots were magnificent: professional, knowledgeable, skillful and fun to be with. We camped beside the river and they made delicious meals for us. They solved problems and explained things in advance. They did a great job of timing our starts and stops so that it seemed as though we were the only visitors. We made some short hikes up side canyons and learned about the birds and wildlife, river history, and the geology of the Canyon. We were taken from and to Flagstaff on buses at the beginning and end of the trip. Some new buses might be in order as they are old and one of ours overheated on the way back to Flagstaff on the last day and we had to wait for an hour for the engine to cool. However the AzRA staff at the hotel were welcoming, informative, friendly and efficient. Anke drove us to find the shuttle bus back to Phoenix airport when we were about to miss it."
158,8-Day Motorized GC Trip with AzRA = Trip of a Lifetime!,"Our family including 2 boys, ages 13 and 15, had the immense pleasure of rafting the Upper Colorado with Arizona Raft in late August 2016. The trip was simply phenomenal.  We booked in early January and many trips had already been sold out, so if you're considering, book as early as possible to get the trip you want. On the Upper Canyon trip, you will begin the trip at essentially the start of the GC and see the walls of the Canyon grow around you as you paddle down the river, just amazing. Each day is highlighted by a stop to hike and explore fun and surprising parts of the Canyon. I cannot divulge the secret stops of the Adventure Club!  Evenings you will set up camp and sleep by the river, in a tent or under the stars if you wish. My 15 year old slept outside every night and loved it. (There is no reception in the Canyon = priceless!) The trip ends at the bottom of the Bright Angel Trail and you will then have a beautiful hike up to the top of the South Rim. This is very doable if you are healthy and in shape but you will carry your pack with everything you brought in up the trail; I believe there are mule options if needed.  AZRA is very well run and they provided us with lots of info before the trip (e.g., travel logistics, what to pack and expect) so we felt properly prepared. All our river guides - Owen, Steve, Clare, Michele, Dan, and Astrid -  were great. Not only did they regularly share their knowledge of the Canyon's geology and history, they also were experienced guides, kind, helpful, fun, and very good cooks.  I am somewhat particular about the quality of food my family eats and was thrilled with the menu every single day. We had tasty, healthy, and plentiful snacks and entrees. Oh yes, the rapids. Initially I was slightly apprehensive about the rapids (e.g., kid falling out of the boat or drowning or whatever). No worries. The guides are more than competent and the Upper portion allows you to ease into the rapids as they get larger as you travel down the river. Rafting fears sufficiently conquered.Our group of about 20 was a mix of 2 other families with teens, couples, and singles - great folks, all of em.  We were so lucky to have shared this adventure with such interesting and genuinely nice people. Overall, a truly epic family adventure that we will remember for a very long time. Thank you AZRA. I want to be a river guide when I grow up!"
159,The trip of a lifetime,"Our family chartered an 8 day motorized trip.  It was the vacation of a lifetime.  The Grand Canyon still feels like an Undiscovered Gem.  So clean and pristine.  AZRA was so good to work with from registration through the entire trip.  We had ages 9 through 52 and all had a great time--15 guests total.  The camping is fairly hardcore (some bugs, snakes, scorpions, setting up and taking down tents, and some bad weather) so those less inclined to camp were worn out and ready for a shower and a flush toilet a few days before the trip was over.  The highlights were the scenery, the side hikes, the food, the laughter after a rapid and fun and kind guides.  If my family were stronger campers I would make this a recurring trip every 2 or 3 years.  Beautiful, unique, active, memorable. Read The Emerald Mile as a warmup for the trip."
160,A Trip Beyond All Expectations,"My wife and I had a great 16 day rafting and hiking trip with guides Jed, Aaron, John, Lexie, Loren and Whalen.  The guides were very knowledgeable about the history, geology, hikes and all the rapids along the river.  They were also a lot of jun.  We saw amazing scenery in side canyons.  Some of the hikes involved numerous creek crossings, scrambling over boulders and climbing but the guides were always encouraging and helpful.  The meals were tasty with lots of variety and there was always plenty of food.  We would highly recommend AZRA for this kind of trip on the Colorado River."
161,Can't wait to go again,"It is an unforgettable experience just to see the splendor of the Grand Canyon and that experience is totally enhanced by the knowledgable and experienced river guides from AZRA.  It was a floating class room that included hikes to ancient sites as well as a complete history of the evolution of the rock masses that make up the Canyon.  All of that and some of the best food I have eaten.  I don't know what I can claim to have loved the best: seeing the early sun hitting the top of the canyon, falling asleep under the stars without need for a tent, the passion in the river guides about maintaining this magnificent area and the history that it holds, all the laughter with my fellow boat people and river guides, the fury of some of the rapids that were navigated so well by the river guides and then there was the food-heavenly.  If you are thinking of a trip down the Canyon-DO IT and let AZRA take you.  I had gone with them 20 years ago on a paddle trip and this time on a motorized launch with my partner who had never been to the Grand Canyon.  This company and its river guides truly are like fine wine aged to perfection."
162,A trip that should be on everyone's bucket list,"This was our first time to the Grand Canyon, and our first rafting in whitewater. Arizona Raft Adventures (AzRA) web site and email communications were excellent, and gave an accurate picture of what to expect.  The AzRA river guides were expert in all aspects of rafting, very knowledgeable about the Grand Canyon’s history, geology, plants, and animals, and always keeping an eye out for our safety – reminding us to get wet, drink a lot, and wear our shoes at camp.  They also were friendly, welcoming and fun. We are especially grateful to the AzRA team for their fantastic work in helping my brother cope with a sudden episode of atrial fibrillation.  The team's medical skills and calm expertise were remarkable, and the process of getting my brother airlifted out went incredibly smoothly.  Many thanks also to Fred for taking my brother to the hospital emergency room.  AzRA is top notch!  We highly recommend them."
163,An amazing escape from the modern world,"I did the 16 day, hiking emphasis, non-motorized rafting trip on the Grand Canyon (April 15-30, 2015) with AZRA, and it was amazing.  The canyon is spectacular, the hikes were wonderful, the rapids were exciting, the food was fabulous.  But, most important, the guides were top notch.  They really knew the river, and shared a lot of information that added to the experience.  Each guide had a different story and something wonderful to offer.  They were very concerned about the comfort and well being of participants. The guides just made it all fun! I felt so lucky to be in such beauty for 16 days.  I didn't want it to end.  But if you go, be prepared for some discomfort:  the water hitting you in the rapids is 50 degrees; the weather early in the season can be cool or hot or perfect; sand gets into everything; you definitely have to pay attention to moisturizing your skin in the dry climate. But it's all more that worth it."
164,Dories and Stories in the Grand Canyon,"So if you're serious about doing the Grand Canyon right, this is way to do it and the only rafting company to consider.  We recently completed the Lower Canyon after doing the Upper eight years ago.  If you can make the time to do it, Lower Canyon is the way to go. More rapids, waterfalls, hikes and wildlife.  The guides were an outstanding mix of experience and personalities that all worked together to make it an exceptional experience.  They love the Canyon and working for this outfitter who clearly values them.  This is a hands on, active trip which in the summer will push you.  But thats' what makes it so memorable.  You become a floating tribe for nine days.  For families with teenagers it's a rare extended break from electronics and pure family time. This is one of those significant investments of time and money that you'll treasure forever.  There's only one Grand Canyon. Do it right."
165,15 day rafting adventure down the Grand Canyon,"It's hard to know where to begin in describing my experience whitewater rafting in the Grand Canyon.  It's been something I've always wanted to do and a friend from college got the ball rolling.  My college buddy and family flew in from Texas and I took my 22 year old daughter and her boyfriend who flew in from Oregon.    We did a 6 day trip where we met in Flagstaff.  Had a meeting the night we got in to  go over logistics of the trip.  The next day we were taken to Lee's Ferry where we started our adventure!  It was an amazing trip!  All of the guides were great and made the trip that much more enjoyable.  My hats off  to Ed who was our trip leader!!  He knows the river so well and took us to so many cool places.  We did alot of day hikes that were awesome!  AZRA is an amazing company to book your trip through.  They've got the system down.  All the food was delicious,  the groover was always placed with awesome views of the river!  All the guides were super friendly and very knowledgable about the canyon.  I learned alot about rock formations that was very interesting.  Who would have thought  geology could be so cool!I feel like I experienced some emotions on this trip that I had'nt experienced in awhile.  The canyon is so beautiful and serene.  I loved just soaking in the beauty.  The rapids were exciting!The water was very cold, but refreshing.  We were there in July and had great weather.On the 6th day we hiked out Bright Angel trail.  It was a beautiful hike!!  Its great because every mile or so there is a watering station where you can fill up your water.  That was helpful because you did'nt have to carry alot of water.Made it to the top in about 5 hours and felt great!!I felt like I was still in river mode for about a week after I got back to Scottsdale.  I was definitely on a high and it took me some time to come down.In summary, I will be back to raft the lower half soon.I loved AZRA!!  They did such a great job with every aspect of the trip!!Thanks to all of you that made it a trip of a lifetime!!"
166,Be one in a million to raft the Grand Canyon,"Going down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon is a bucket list trip. AZRA made me and my wife feel safe every step of the way. This was our first multi day river trip and the crew, led by Summer, were incredible. Knowledge, confidence, whitewater skill and overall personalities were outstanding. We chose to do a hiking oriented lower canyon trip and I can't wait to go back and do the whole canyon with my boys. Thank you AZRA for an incredible trip and reopening my eyes to the world of whitewater adventure. Doug"
167,BEST TRIP EVER!,"Arizona Raft Adventures provided a once in a lifetime adventure floating the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.  From start to finish, it was an outstanding trip.  Expert, friendly guides, delicious food, and unbelievable sights, I loved it all!"
168,Bucket list #3- Rafting through the Grand Canyon,"Our family & two other families just returned from rafting the Grand Canyon. We went with Arizona Raft Adventures (AZRA), which is a top-notch commercial guide company.  Our group ranged in age from 13-52 and everyone had an amazing time. The guides were knowledgeable, experienced, friendly and really fun to be with. Obviously, the scenery is the main attraction here. The lack of cell service and media was never missed. Even by the 13-25 yr olds! We were all able to ""step out"" of our regular lives to be humbled by the awe of the Grand. Camping under the stars, hiking to waterfalls, paddling through rapids, exploring caves, viewing wildlife, and eating delicious food were just some of the experiences we had.There is the option of rafting the ""first half"" (6-7 days) with the mellowest rapids, the ""second half"" (9-10 days) with more exciting rapids, or the whole thing (about 16 days).The trip begins outside Flagstaff, at Lee's Ferry. The ""halfway"" point for those hiking out or in is via the ""Bright Angel Trail"" near Phantom Ranch. Those doing the full trip don't have to hike in or out. AZRA provides the camping gear (tents, sleeping bags, food, etc.) Participants bring their clothes and personal items. AZRA is very accommodating to those with special food needs.This is an ""active"" vacation. It requires general fitness and a sense of adventure. Safety is paramount and the first priority of the guides. Life jackets are worn at all times, while on the river.I highly recommend this trip and I'm happy to be contacted about it."
169,"It's AMAZING, the Grand Canyon","One of my best friends and I just returned home from the 6 day upper canyon classic trip with AzRA.  I've been to the South Rim several times but this trip blew all my other Grand Canyon experiences away.  Nothing compares to seeing the Canyon from the river - the vastness and magnitude of those walls in the ever changing light and shadows will forever be etched into my memory.  This was my first multi-day rafting trip and AzRA has set the bar impossibly high - first and foremost the guides were friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and experienced.  I was expecting some scenic hikes and exciting whitewater and they delivered on both accounts - but I also learned about Grand Canyon geology, history, and anthropology.  Deliciously amazing and fresh meals - I ate better on this trip than I do at home!  From the first pre-trip meeting to the hike up Bright Angel Trail at the end, AzRA was organized, professional, safety-minded, and customer service oriented. I cannot recommend them highly enough if you are considering a Grand Canyon rafting trip."
170,Be Sure of What You're Signing Up For,"I just completed the 10-day motorized raft trip of the Grand Canyon.  The trip started as a ""bucket list"" item and quickly became much more meaningful than a check mark.  Our guides created an atmosphere of community, kindness, and fun.  We came from all over the country and most of us didn't  know each other but quickly became a cohesive community.   Our guides were Omar and Kelli and they were outstanding.  They are knowledgable, passionate, and skilled raft guides (and they can cook some great meals)."
171,2013 kayak Full Canyon,"We have just returned from the 9 day Lower Canyon Classic trip; being Brits we became known for our understatement but in Arizona speak this trip was AWESOME! I had last done the same trip 34 years ago so was excited to be reliving my childhood experience with my children - 13 & 15 (and husband). This included BIG rapids, stunning side canyons, swimming riffles (mini rapids), challenging and easy hikes, jumping off ledges etc the list is endless.The Grand Canyon is arguably the most spectacular place on earth. To spend 8 nights camping under the stars with the moon floodlighting the canyon walls was fantastic. The rapids were exciting (particularly in the back of the dory or front of the paddle boat). Paddling was much more fun than I'd anticipated and our teenagers were so excited to paddle Lava Falls.The Guides were without exception completely first class. Not only are they immensely skilled and strong at handling the boats but their kindness and tolerance for their guests knows no bounds. They coped with all our stupid questions so don't be shy asking.The Canyon is an environment to be treated with respect, not only to protect its ecology but also because you quickly learn the fragility of your own body - keep drinking, then drink some more. You are in a remote and hot location and incidents are best avoided but do from time to time occur. The Guides were exceptionally professional at managing those that arose on our trip with good outcomes.The food was extraordinary - fresh salad even on the last day, steak, chocolate cake, mexican etc. What we came away with was a rounded view of the Grand Canyon; the history of its exploration, its geology, ecology, poetry and writings all shared by our Guides in morning and evening sessions and as we travelled along. Our group of travellers (16 guests, 6 guides and one office staff member) had great fun sharing stories, teasing each other and helping each other out - it was a team.Top tips if you sign up - 1) Put up a tent every night even if you never sleep in it - rain can start very suddenly and be very heavy- and it makes a good changing room!2) Long shorts / over the knee zip offs were good for keeping sun off your knees 3) Sand is a reality of life in the canyon - easier to just accept it will get everywhere4) Help with the cooking - it is good fun (top tip from my kids)5) Don't worry if you're shattered the first couple of days - you will soon settle into the routine6) Bring some extra plastic bags / dry bags to keep wet stuff separated from dry stuff in the kit bags you are provided with7) Different coloured packing cubes make organising your stuff and finding it much easier8) If you want to do a long day hike then have a daysac / hip bag big enough to carry 3 litres of water  (long hikes are not compulsory there is always a short option)9) Water bottles that have a solid loop for your carabiner are better than thin plastic loops as that stretches when hanging from a carabiner10) Try to keep your feet dry for a few hours each day - keeps them healthy11) Have some electrolyte solution each day (this is provided)"
172,AzRA Guides,"In May 2007 I participated in the 2 week float trip down the Grand Canyon River with AzRA. I can not imagine a more amazing trip exists anywhere on the earth. The beauty of the canyon and the river is of course unparalleled, but it was AzRA's knowledgeable and fun guides, the superb (and quite gourmet) camp food and the pace of the trip that transported me and the others into an entirely different world. My friend who organized the trip told us before hand that this was a once in a lifetime trip and it was something that everyone simply MUST do. To say she was right would be an understatement. The cost was a little daunting before I went, but after I got back I realized I would have gladly paid double. I hope to have the chance to do it all over again in the future and it will be with AzRA!"
173,2 week Grand Canyon full raft,"My raft trip with AzRA was a wonderful experience that exceeded my expectations by a large measure. My biggest surprise was the incredible hikes to side canyons that would have required multiple, multiple day hikes from the rim. The Canyon, as seen from the Colorado is beyond magnificent and borders on a transformative personal experience. From the office staff to the guides, the food, the logistics (there was a fair bit of that) were exceptional, professional and very guest oriented. I will definitely take another trip with AzRA, hopefully soon."
174,Grand Canyon 2 week hybrid trip,"Azra is simply magnificent: organization impeccable, food outstanding, venue 2nd to none.Staff courteous, helpful, fun and friendly - impossible to imagine anyone not enjoying this level of hospitality and care in a challenging environment."
175,AzRA 8-day motorized Grand Canyon trip,"My husband and son went on a 6 day river rafting trip through the upper canyon with AZRA.  They can't stop talking about it; it was the trip of a lifetime.  The guides were fantastic and knowledgeable.  The food was very good.  The experience A+.  The company is well managed, organized, and hires the best guides.  From the information we received in advance to explain what they should expect, to the instruction during the trip, to the way they took care of all the participants, there was no room for improvement.  They had a wonderful time and would highly recommend it if you like camping and the outdoors."
176,6 stars!!!!! Best experience of my whole life.,"Rafting the Grand Canyon has always been on the bucket list, and we finally did it during the height of Covid-19.  Thanks to a last-minute cancellation, we finagled our way onto a motor trip down the entire length of the Colorado River over 8 days and 7 nights.  This trip goes on the best-ever vacation list, alongside the Galapagos, Fiji and African safaris, and I’m even not that much of an outdoorsman!First - the adventure.  Over 100 rapids, amazing geological formations, wonderful Native American history from the indigenous tribes, beautiful side canyons with hikes, waterfalls, pools, lounging areas, great spots for lunch and overnight camping,  and 150 years of history starting with the first river-runner himself, John Wesley Powell.  Learning during an adventure is the best combination, and this trip does both.  Personal suggestion: read the Emerald Mile book before you go on the trip, you’ll learn a ton.Now, the guides.  Arizona Raft Adventures is rated #1 on TripAdvisor for very good reason. They are attentive, they are informative, they prepare well, and that’s before we even get on the river!  Once we’re on our way, the guides are helpful, insightful, careful, fun-loving, and entirely focused on ensuring we had a great time.  They work 16 hours a day, from before sun-up to well after sun-down, and their entire focus is on ensuring the trip is as memorable as possible.  Great meals 3x a day, excellent camping gear, very well-outfitted raft, and a “Groover” to take care of the unmentionable acts :-)Our trip was with two larger families and our group took up an entire motor raft - 11 of us in total.  Being on a trip where we knew everyone when we put into the water at Lee’s Ferry made the adventure even sweeter. We even had four children on the raft who were under 14 years old.  Seeing the Canyon and the adventures through their eyes made it even more memorable. Plus having the motor was really appreciated during the long hauls between rapids.  A paddle trip or even on a Dory would be even more beguiling, but not with kids.We had a chance to see some of the other operators in action during our trip, and that made it that much more obvious how great Azraft is.  They participate in every adventure, they helped us through the gnarly parts, they never tired of informing us of what was coming up next (even though I’m sure they’ve shared many of the same stories many times over), and they knew every rock in every rapid like it was their back yard.So, about as easy a 5-star review as I’ve written for TripAdvisor .  If you’re going to raft the Grand Canyon, call up Arizona Raft Adventures first.  There may be quite a wait to get on one of their boats, but it will be worth it.  And if you’re one of the 6 million who only see the Grand Canyon from the rim and not from the river, find a way to raft the river.  It’s a tremendous life experience.Freddie, Jan, Delaney, Tiana - you’re the best!  Thanks for the memories..."
177,AzRA motorized Grand Canyon trip,"In May 2010 we took an 8-day motorized rafting trip through the Grand Canyon with AZRA. From beginning to end our guides, Molly, Susan and Lisa, and team leader, Dave, made sure we experienced everything the canyon had to offer. We hiked side canyons each day, learned about the history and the geology of the canyon, experienced exciting rapids and also had time to read and write about all we were seeing. Each evening at twilight they offered stories, some about the earlier explorers in the canyon and some just great short stories. The food was carefully prepared, always fresh and extremely tasty. The cuisine ran the gamut from grilled steaks and salmon to Chicken Curry and Pasta with Pesto. Breakfasts were hearty and the coffee was great! AZRA easily accommodated my husband's need for a gluten-free diet by making sure that he always had options available. The list of recommended clothing items to bring was right on target; we were prepared for the swings in weather that occurred and also for the chilly Colorado River water. The tents and sleeping bags provided were clean and cozy.One of the best parts of the trip was meeting and sharing the experience with the 19 other guests. By the end of the trip everyone in our group had created a bond of friendship that continues now as we share photos by email.AZRA takes great care in making sure that their customers have the best river rafting experience possible. From the trip orientation person at the hotel to the bus driver to our wonderful guides, each helped make this a trip of a lifetime."
178,Grand Canyon River Trip,"This was an amazing trip for my husband, myself and our 17 and 19 year old boys. AzRA is an amazing company that makes a committment  to each guest to tend to  their enjoyment of the experience.  The guides are knowledgable, skilled and dedicated.  i highly recommend this trip to any family who likes an adventure and who enjoys the astounding beauty of the canyon."
179,Best vacation ever!,"If you've run across other reviews of mine on Trip Advisor, you might be thinking ""SHE went on a river-rafting trip?"" I'm more of a museums and mid-day wine-break traveler. I don't hike. I don't sleep on the ground. I don't like heat. But when a friend had spaces available on an 8-day motorized rafting tour of the Grand Canyon, I couldn't pass it up.I was anxious but couldn't pass it up. Thank goodness. It was an absolutely awesome experience, in every sense of the word. The canyon and the river were, indeed, awe-inspiring. The five guides on our trip were amazingly knowledgeable and so generous with their energy, grace and good humor. The food was FANTASTIC! The logistics were all handled beautifully. It was an all-around trip of a lifetime. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
180,Highly recommend AzRA,"I was part of the group that did a chartered 15 day combination dory and raft trip in August 2015 from Lee's Ferry to Diamond Creek.  This was a chartered trip, but it appears to be much like the Dories and Stories trip.  There were two wooden dories, two aluminum dories, and three rafts, one with just gear.  We rotated among the different boats.  Brad Dimock was one of the guides.  He probably know more than anyone alive about the history of running the river and is a great storyteller.  The quality of the guides was uniformly excellent, great on the river and all contributed in many often surprising ways to making the trip an adventure.  The trip leader managed the trip well and made good adjustments along the way.  The food was very good.  It was remarkable what came out of the kitchen considering where we were.  The AzRa gear and camp arrangements work well. The river is big, but never scary (at least to me).  In large part this is a credit to the expertise of the boatmen.  I floated a couple of smaller rapids, which I would recommend doing once you get far enough down the river for it warm up a bit.  The hikes get you to some remarkable places - Deer Creek and Havasu stand out.  The nigh sky is big and bright.  It gets hot, sand gets in everything, and the river was mostly the color of chocolate milk, but you quickly learn to deal with it.  Being in the Canyon for this long is an amazing experience.  Leave your watch in the hotel and enjoy.I can recommend AzRA without reservation."
181,So much fun!  We enjoyed!!,"Don't think that standing at the rim and snapping photos is the best way to experience the Grand Canyon.  Even hiking down a trail is not enough.  Get on the water, get in a raft and prepare for the ride of your life!  Arizona Raft Adventures is a personable, efficient, organized operation.  They anticipate your needs, prepare you in advance and provide the best experience possible.  Their guides are experienced, passionate about the river, its history and preservation. And the food--unbelievably gourmet! We just finished our 6 day raft trip on the upper canyon and I still dream about it at night. AzRa, thank you for the trip of a lifetime.  Ron and Lin Baesler"
182,Lower Canyon Hybrid Trip,"Over the past 15 or so years, we have been able to experience 5 AZRA trips, starting with a 6-day upper classic, then two lower classics, then an an upper all paddle, and most recently, a 14 day classic. Each and every trip has been special and inspiring. The quality and expertise of the guides, the AMAZING food, the variety of activities and the opportunity to interact with other guests and the guides keep us coming back again and again. AZRA makes it possible for us to 'get' the Grand Canyon.  It is a wonderful feeling to be about 10 or 11 days into your trip and realize that you have not spent even one moment thinking about your ordinary life and that you don't really care about what is happening on a daily basis elsewhere.  This is truly a get away vacation and everyone who has a sense of adventure should give it a try."
183,AzRA provided the most special trip of my life!,"I was on an 8 day, 226 mile river trip in early May.  I wasn't sure I wanted to be on motor rafts because of the lack of exercise, but there were many challenging hikes, always with spectacular destinations - waterfalls, swimming holes, granaries.  Our guides were very knowledgeable about the canyon and were superb boatmen/women.  The food was excellent and healthy.  We had a wide variety of  meals -- from salmon with quinoa to Thai chicken to steaks.  We had avocados every day.  Salads were plentiful and varied.  Sleeping under the stars on the quality sleeping pads, bags, and sheets provided by AzRA was a highlight of the trip. No worries about hearing snorers with the lovely sound of the river providing white noise.  We needed tents only 2 nights, and they were easy to put up.  (I am not usually a camper)  There were two guitars and a harmonica on the trip and lots of singing.  Everything was first class -- pure maple syrup for blueberry pancakes and french toast; Mrs. Meyers soap.  Hand washing was mandatory and easy with the set up put out first thing at lunch stops and camping sites.  AzRA provided lots of information before the trip, and we were very well prepared. Their little pop-up store at the Doubletree provided last minute items.  Don't forget to buy/bring a sarong!"
184,A wonderful experience in the canyon,"My husband and I went with another fifty-something couple on the 8 day motorised trip down the Canyon. This involved going down through approximately 200 mi of the best rapids in the river with arguably the most spectacular scenery on a raft powered by a 30 hp engine which could carry 18. We chose this option from the wide variety of trips as it suited our schedule, fitness levels (other trips involve hiking up or down the Bright Angel Trail or longer durations with paddling). We also liked the opportunity to hike in the Canyon.We were impressed with AZRaft from our first contact with their office staff who were prompt, informative and friendly. And it just got better. Clearly these guys have learned from their many years in the business as demonstrated by the detailed nature of their logistics- pre,  syn and post trip. They thought of EVERYTHING. This thoroughness is reassuring given the potential hazards and it allows the participants to relax with the trip. Once on the river, the guides were sensitive to the risk tolerance, fitness and interests of the rafters. They were clearly familiar with many aspects of the flora, fauna and geology and clearly had a love for the River. And they had a sense of humour and fun. This helped build a shared experience and camaraderie for the rafters. The food was abundant and excellent. The only niggle I had is that my sleeping bag and linen smelled of liniment- more thorough cleaning and airing between trips wouldn't go amiss. The pre-trip manual is invaluable - read it well in advance. Bring a bandana and LOTS of heavy-duty moisturiser. Know that everything on the boat will probably get at least a little wet so consider whether your $3000 camera should be left at home. Finally the scenery is magnificent, the rapids are scary-fun and for the most part the river is not congested- only a few stops get busy with other rafts. We are so glad we did it. I would have loved to have tried a bit of paddling - maybe next time!"
185,Fabulous rafting trip with AzRA,"We went on a charter motorized trip of the full Grand Canyon.  Azra did a fantastic job of organizing everything up front as well as throughout the entire trip.  Our trip leader (Rob) was super knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the geology of the canyon (and everything else about the canyon) and made us feel like we were part of the story of the canyon.  The other guides were wonderful and fun to be with the whole time.  Great cooks too!  Great food, very relaxing time.   I completely forgot about human time during the whole trip.  My wife and I would highly recommend Azra."
186,My experience was above and beyond my expectations!!!,My husband and I signed up for an 8 day motor trip down the Colorado through the Grand Canyon.  He had been down the Canyon before.  I had not.  We were a total of 13 people with 3 guides.  It was stunning.  Amazing.  Sublime.  Words and pictures will always fall short when I try to describe the experience.  Simply put- everyone should do this trip.  For me it was a process to settle into the Canyon.  There are definitely some things to get used to and discomforts to endure.  And then there was a point where all of that fell away and there was just the experience of a lifetime.
187,Best trip ever!,"My wife and I just finished a 15 day full canyon hybrid trip with AzRA. My wife rafted with 5 other ladies and she had no prior river experience. I kayaked with 5 other mates. Brad Dimmock was the paddle raft guide and he is quite simply a Colorado river legend. Having written books about the canyon he kept us all entertained between rapids and the ladies were in very safe hands with such an experienced guide and watching their  confidence grow with each day made our trip so much better. Dirk, Jody, John, Kristin and Lynn were our other guides. AWESOME is not even close to how highly I recommend these people. Great food, fun, stories, guidance and awesome campfire singers!Needless to say, the canyon was amazing too. The sights just kept on coming and really got in the way of my kayaking!! The rapids were incredibly good fun and nowhere near as intimidating as many might expect. Each day we also did side hikes up to the rim or along stream beds to see waterfalls or listen to someone play the guitar in a nice spot.We ate like kings and were treated like friends. It took me 23 years and 1 month to fulfill my dream to kayak the Grand Canyon......but I will be back much sooner next time. Thanks AzRA, thanks so much :-)"
188,Where to begin...,"My wife and I did a motorized raft trip with AzRA in May 2007.  It was a truly memorable experience, so when a couple of my hiking friends who live in Vancouver, WA talked about some sort of Arizona adventure, I suggested that we might do a rafting trip.  Because one of them has limited vacation time, we decided to limit it to a week and do a half-canyon oar trip in September of 2009.  The weather turned out to be wonderful, the AzRA guides took care of all our needs and kept us very well fed.  They showed us some really remarkable scenery in side canyons.  They let us give the oars a try.  When we hiked out, they sent a guide down to the river to make sure we did OK on our hike out.  All in all it was just a wonderful experience."
189,Adventure of a lifetime,"My husband and I and our 31 year old daughter took this trip. My concern was that the motorized trip would be too ""wimpy"" for really experiencing the river, but it definitely wasn't.  Be prepared for quickly changing weather conditions including cold and rain and some exhilarating rapids. The guides did a wonderful job and the food was terrific.  It was definitely quite an adventure and seeing the Grand Canyon via river rafting is a spectacular way to be immersed in the scenery and overall experience of the Canyon.  It was a memorable family vacation and I highly recommend it and AZRA."
190,Worth Every Penny,"We just finished a 14-day all paddle trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon with Arizona Raft Adventures, otherwise known as AzRA.  Everything was well-organized.  The guides were all knowledgeable and fun to be around.  We did a lot of hiking in side canyons as well as paddling the river from mile 0 to mile 224 at Diamond Creek.  We learned a lot about the history, geology and flora/fauna of the Grand Canyon.  It was a great trip.  Our guides were B.J., Somer, Nate, Liam and Betsy, with Amy and Lila as assistants.  They all did a great job on the rafts as well as making the meals and planning adventures every day, including helping us climb over up rocks and through creeks.If you are thinking about taking a trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, I would definitely recommend these outfitters.   Besides the 'all paddle' trip that we took, they have hybrid trips, oar boat trips, motor trips and kayak trips."
191,Amazing 8 Day Adventure,"There is nothing like this on planet Earth. Of course the breathtaking scenery is a given, and there is nothing that compares to seeing it from the bottom up! You can read all sorts of glowing reviews on the web, so let me offer a little different perspective: First, you need to go with a company called AzRA. With a 100% Excellence rating, the decision is easy. Wherever you are right now, you can be on a plane tomorrow, and be on the Colorado River the day after that. There is no other adventure on Earth that is this accessible.  If you are not sure about spending a couple of weeks camping out, you only have to be able to do two things: Eat and Sleep! The meals are all provided for you, and it is all good. Sleeping in a tent, or under the stars, is very easy to get used to. You won’t hear any complaints about it. At the end of a day of river running or light hiking, sleeping comes naturally. If you are concerned about running whitewater rapids, believe me, it is FUN! Watch some YouTube videos. It only looks exciting because it is! You won’t hit anything big until you have been on the river for a few days. You will quickly realize that you are in good hands with the AZRA guides. By the time you hit any big rapids, you will be used to the feel of the boat. Don’t let this be the reason for not doing this trip. It is an experience that you will remember and talk about the rest of your life. Daily activities usually include some “off the river” time, like hiking or exploring. There are always options, like hanging out around the boats reading, relaxing or exploring, if you are not up for hiking that day. Finally, something that you don’t hear much about is the “group” experience. You will be with two dozen like-minded people, ages from the 20’s to the 70’s. Everyone, including the AzRA guides, are there for the same reason: total enjoyment of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River. The group is usually a nice mix of singles, relatives, and friends traveling together. The group quickly becomes familiar with one another, and sharing the experience of the Canyon with travel mates is an unexpected pleasure. Plus, those experienced guides are right in there with you having fun. If you are unsure about doing something like this by yourself, it is a special shared experience that you need to do at least once in your life. I have been down the river with AzRA 3 times, and have made reservations for a 4th trip next summer! They are the best. I can’t wait to do it again."
192,Our 8 days on the river was the trip of a lifetime!,"First class trip down the Grand in mid to late August 2012.  Arizona Raft Adventures, which runs trips out of Flagstaff, provided everyone with an amazing time, very professionally run, with no major events.  The food the 3 guides cooked was amazing.  We usually traveled in 2-hour increments, starting about 8AM after breakfast, and stopping for hikes, lunch, more hikes, and around 3 to 3:30 we would stop for that night's camp.  Randy, our head guide, had many years of experience and was an exceptional guide, as was Dave.  We only had one boat, which I think gave our trip better flexibliity, 11 passengers, 3 guides.  We had a boat where we sat looking aside, not forward, and were constantly crooning our necks to see the vistas, sitting in a forward position would have been better.  And there is no back support, so the seats become uncomfortable after awhile.  Arizona Raft doesn't pack as many in a boat as other tour companies, which is a good thing, we never felt cramped.  The gear they sell at the Radisson orientation is first rate and includes everything you need at excellent prices.  The bus ride out of the canyon was much more jarring than any of the rapids we rode.  Although the bus seats were new, thick and softly cushioned, the stiff school bus chassis was a poor match for the rutted dirt rode and we were severely jostled for an hour, but I'm not taking a star off just for that.  The motorized trips offer a much safer ride, as we were never in danger of tipping over.  They are about 30% faster down the river vs. an oar boat, which helps cover more ground in less time, thus more time for hiking and less time on the water which I think is a good thing.  Nobody was bothered by the sound of the outboard, it was very quiet and run at low power almost all the time.Be forewarned about factors outside the tour companies' domain:  1) The temperature is hot this time of year in the canyon.  Around 110 and not cooling down until past midnight.  Most nights we slept in a breathable sheet on top of our sleeping bags, or didn't even use the sheet, getting into the sleeping bag around 3AM.  We used the tent once when it rained.  Riding on the boat with the air current over the cool water made it seem cooler than it actually was. 2) Although mosquitos were rare, the campsites had fire ants running around until dark.  They give nasty bites.  Bring hydrocortisone to relieve itching.3) The river water was continuously chocolate brown (see attached photos) from the monsoon season that supposedly ends around mid August and looked plain icky.  If I had to do it over again, I would have avoided this time of year.4) Bring a waterproof camera case, everyone had one, you will get splashed.If I were to do another trip, I would definitely go with Arizona Raft Adventures again."
193,Grand Canyon Rafting,This was a fantastic trip. It has been on my bucket list for 20 years since I first hiked the canyon. I had a last minute opportunity to fill in for someone who couldn't go. When my friend called and said they had an opening I jumped on it right away. I am glad I did. AZRA was the best. They always answered the phone when I had questions and answered my questions very knowledgeably. The guides were also very knowledgeable about the history of the area and jumped right in and enjoyed everything we did with us. We had people from age 12 to 72 on this trip and all were accommodated. Food was great as everybody says and lots of it. Great trip and great company! Gary F Tennessee
194,rapids: 10; Guides: 10; legacy memories:10,"Without a doubt a river trip down the Grand Canyon is a ""trip of a lifetime"".  As such, you definitely want to go with the best outfitter possible, and Arizona Raft Adventures (AzRA) is the best!In the fall of 2008 I did a fifteen day trip down the ""Grand"" with AzRA and I could not be more pleased with my decision to go with AzRA.  This company is one of the most experienced, trusted, and respected outfitters on the Colorado River and for good reason.  Their rafts and equipment (e.g. tents, sleeping pads, etc.) are in excellent condition and the guides are top shelf.  For example, the trip leader (Bev) was constantly networking with other groups on the river regarding specific campsites that would set us up perfectly for a hike the next day, or that would ensure we were on a particular section of the river at the best river flows, etc.  It was obvious that all of the boatmen respected and loved the Canyon and they want their guests to have the trip of a lifetime.In closing, if you are going to float the Grand Canyon, go with Arizona Raft Adventures.  You will not be disappointed."
195,All around great trip,"More stars in the rating and also in the sky.Completed a oar/paddle raft trip with AzRA in May '15. Cannot say enough, world class whitewater and the best setting on the planet. Day hikes were absolutely unbelievable.Even if you are not a camper this is not a trip to miss. The memories you make will have you smiling for a lifetime.You can be in ""life's parade or watch it go by"".A shout out to the crew Derik, Andrew, Kelli, Lora, Stinny & Anna. GREAT JOB ! Steve T"
196,Super logistics,"My wife and I have traveled all around the world and hiked in many of our National Parks.  This trip was probably the best trip we have ever been on.  The sights and sounds of the Grand Canyon/Colorado River were beyond description.  Our fellow travelers became ""best friends"" very quickly and the crew was helpful beyond expectations.  Very knowledgeable and trained us how to survive the wilderness - and provided four star food every meal.  We did the eight day motorized trip and may try the ten day ""oar boat"" version in the near future.  This was probably the only trip my wife and I have even considered repeating - a trip of a lifetime."
197,Not a trip for everyone,"Just completed the hiking emphasis nonmotorized raft trip for the lower half of the canyon (Bright Angel to Diamond Springs).  Everything was done well.  The guides were all terrific.  If you are thinking this trip belongs on your bucket list, you are absolutely right."
198,Best guides on the river!!,"If you are considering a river trip through the Grand Canyon, the only rafting company you should do with is AZRA.  We just returned from 9 days on the river with the best guides I've ever been with--and I used to be an adventure-based trainer/facilitator.  First off, the most important thing: safety.  This team of five (both women and men) were an awesome team.  Totally competent to navigate even the biggest rapids.  And our paddle boat guide continually turned a bunch of wanna-be paddlers into a crew that made it through Lava FallsL  So--you're in safe hands.  Second of all--they clearly take care of their rafts and equipment; everything was in great condition.  They took us on great side hikes to see incredible aspects of the Canyon that very few ever see.  And they did a wonderful job of taking care of us.  When we settled in the for evening--we enjoyed incredibly delicious food.  They empower everyone on a trip to push just a little beyond their limits, but only enough so that you end your trip knowing you've done something that only a very few people ever do.  I can't recommend AZRA highly enough--a 5++++++"
199,Grand Canyon 14-day Hybrid,"Want to take a short hike to a 12 foot cliff, jump into the Colorado River, float through some rapids, then swim like crazy to the other side where a pristine beach is waiting for your camping pleasure?  If so, this trip is perfect for you.  Our amazing guides showed us awesome waterfalls along our trip.  We also saw Native American artifacts and learned about the formation of the Grand Canyon.  We touched rocks that were 1.5 billion years old.  We saw big horn sheep up close.  Only one person got stung by a scorpion (like a bee sting--not fatal like I originally expected!).   We slept under a million stars while the bats worked all night to keep the bugs away.  We loved it!Jed piloted one raft, and Randy piloted the other.  They were both fantastic, telling stories about quirky river guides while sharing the history and environmental concerns of the area.  (My daughter thought Randy was especially wonderful!)  The other guides--Leslie, Barbara, John, and Thomas--were so helpful.  My 11 year-old daughter was quite the trouper, but got pretty cold one day from the constant splashing of the white water.  Barbara loaned her some waterproof pants which was a huge help and was much appreciated.  Leslie was wonderful as well. Both ladies always had a smile!   I really wanted to get to know them more.  And John and Thomas were such pleasant, well-mannered, young men!  Very helpful too!  When we were off the raft, the guides always made sure everyone was safe. The food was great and plentiful, and as promised, I did not lose weight, even with all of the hiking and swimming.  (Getting to the toilet was a hike itself sometimes!)  The crew set up hand-washing stations at camp and at our lunch stops--I figured we would just have hand sanitizer so this was a much better solution.  Overall this was the most amazing vacation of my live.  My daughter agreed that it beat a week in Disney!   She can't wait to do it again!"
200,"Our 9 day adventure with AZRA was fantastic.     It was a combination of great rafting, hikes, exploration, relaxing.","After reading The Emerald Mile, my husband was set on rafting the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.  After much research, we selected Arizona Raft Adventures (AzRA), to book our 6 day upper canyon trip.  We wanted oar and paddle rafts, not the big motorized rafts (although they do those as well), and we liked their many options of dates and lengths of trips.  We also liked their safety focus and their strict environmental ""leave no trace"" philosophy. The frequent, informative emails helped us to prepare for the trip and the information meeting in Flagstaff the night before was helpful.  The bus ride to Lee's Ferry for put-in was a bit rough. Sit at the front of the bus if you are susceptible to car sickness.The guides were wonderful- skilled, hard working, friendly, personable and professional.  They were all unique and added something special to the trip.  Aaron, our trip leader, took his role seriously and worked hard to ensure we all had a fabulous trip.  We appreciated how hard working each guide was for the entire trip- they worked from before sun up to sun down each day. They worked well as a team and set a warm, friendly tone for us all.I was nervous running the big rapids, but after spending a short time with the guides, my fears were alleviated.  The guides ran the big rapids skillfully and safely.  The times when we were floating down the magnificent canyon were also memorable- Tom playing his guitar and singing, Dan and Howie telling stories, Aaron and John teaching us about the human and geologic history, and Leah making us all laugh. The guides were flexible to the needs of the group and the weather conditions to ensure we had wonderful side hikes and experiences.  This was impressive considering the diversity in our group- from young teenagers to senior citizens.The food was wonderful!  John was an excellent head cook, ensuring we had wholesome, fresh food and all guides prepared delicious meals.Our teenage sons loved the trip and the guides made a point to check with them frequently.  We also were fortunate to have 3 other teenage boys on the trip as well.  The other guests were wonderful people to share our adventure.  All of the boys chose to swim through a rapid and had a blast doing so.  It was smart of the guides to offer this to the guests as a ""safely swim"" experience before the big rapids, just in case.  My boys were not nervous about falling out and knew what to do if they did.We went in late July-early August and loved that we could dunk/ swim in the river to cool down- the sarongs and buffs were invaluable on the trip!  All of our camping spots were beautiful and we loved sleeping under the stars (with a mild annoyance of an ant here and there during the night).  We set up tents in case of rain, but used them mainly for changing and keeping our belongings organized.The beautiful hike out on the Bright Angel trail was an awesome way to end the trip. (Keep the hike in mind when packing if you are not doing the entire 14 day trip- we did not end up using our rain pants or some of the clothing suggestions from the packing list- go light!)  It was stinking hot, but we kept hydrated, wet our clothing often, snacked regularly and went slowly.  You do not have to be a super athlete to successfully hike the trail, but you do have to have a base level of fitness and follow the guidelines of hydrating, eating and going slow. There is a ranger station with an infirmary half way at Indian Garden- if you do not take the hike seriously, you may need their services.  If you are concerned, AzRA sends out training suggestions/guidelines that some in our group said helped immeasurably.   At the end of the trip, AzRA also accepts donations for a Grand Canyon youth group if you do not want to hike out some of your personal gear you packed. (i.e. someone on our trip brought an extra therma-rest mattress and donated it at the end so he did not have to hike it out)My boys want to go with AzRA again an do the lower half of the canyon!  We are grateful to AzRA for such a memorable family experience."
201,Bucket List Trip,"After reading the reviews of AzRA and talking to a friend who took a trip with them a few years ago, I had very high expectations of my Classic trip.  My expectations were met and exceeded.  From my first phone call to the company to the last day of the trip, I was blown away by the professionalism of everyone involved.  The guides (Dirk, Jim, Clare, Owen, Wade) were fantastic.  They took great care of us and clearly love sharing the Grand Canyon experience.  The trip is challenging and absolutely worth the challenges.  It was more or less my first camping experience since I was a kid, I felt completely comfortable. The canyon is stunning--like nothing I've ever seen before--and the trip was life changing.Cannot recommend AzRA highly enough.Oh, bring gloves. That was the one thing I didn't have that I wished I did have.  Ended up borrowing a pair from a guide!"
202,rafting the Grand Canyon,This is one of the great experiences of my life.  It was our 25th anniversary and they did a private dinner with candles in the middle of the trip down the river.  Worth every dollar
203,A Perfect Adventure,"A raft trip through the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River is one of the few remaining great America adventures. We rafted for a week through the spectacular upper Grand Canyon and then hiked out the Bright Angel Trail on the last day. It was truly an adventure; a view of the Canyon that very few will ever know, great companionship, great food and camping, and professional group of river guides. It is impossible to describe the beauty of the Canyon from the bottom looking up. Only those that go. know. You will come to appreciate the solitude, the powers that created the Canyon, the exhilaration of the rapids, and  starlight you can read by. The Bright Angel is a world class trail, and is every bit a part of the adventure. Most of us will only get to experience a trip like this once in a lifetime. My trip advice is to go with the best, AzRA. Their website lays out all the details very well. They have the best guides and the most experience in putting trips like this together. They cover every detail. All you need is some sunscreen and an adventurous spirit."
204,Arizona Raft Trip - Grand Canyon,"This was my first raft trip in the Grand Canyon. My husband and I took the 8-day motor raft trip as part of a private group of 24 people. The AzRA trip leader, Ed, did an exceptional job of planning each day, leaving flexibility to address weather and other rafting parties using campsites. The drivers (Ed, Somer and Alex) showed skill in handling the rafts and made sure we stayed safe onboard and on land. The side trips - swimming in the Little Colorado River and hikes to waterfalls - were perfect. The food prepared for us each day was exceptional - I still don't know how they did it. Kudos to the crew, including swamper Bo."
205,Once in a lifetime dream realised,"We were attracted to this outfitter because they boast on their website about their small group sizes. We signed up for a one boat trip. Then, the outfitter added a second boat to the trip about a month before the trip (without giving us any other options) doubling the size of the group. While this wasn't a problem going down the river, the group was way too large for at least of the campsites we used. A big part of a trip like this is the camping and several nights were extremely unpleasant because we were packed in so tightly.The food was excellent. The camping gear was decent. The guides were knowledgable, even tho they seemed burnt out at times. The river and the canyon are incredible.I'd go again, but not with this outfitter because of the overcrowded camping and the doubling of the size of our group."
206,A trip down the Grand,"Just returned from an 8 day Grand Canyon rafting trip. One of the best vacations so far. The river, the canyon, the people and being disconnected....simply the best. A mental cleanse for sure. Something about that river and canyon that connects at a spiritual level. Thank you to our river guides Ariel, Jed and Kelli for being amazing . The guides are the difference between a good trip and an exceptional one. Arizona Raft Adventures I will be back!"
207,Best trip I've ever been on,"My son and I rafted 226 miles down the Colorado River on an AzRA motorized adventure, which ended on July 30.  We had the most amazing time shooting the rapids, hiking the beautiful high desert canyons, exploring Native American heritage sites, visiting cool waterfalls, sleeping under the stars, and being served the most delicious meals.  The best part of it was our guides Jack and Molly who were there 24/8 for us to ensure we were safe and enjoying our experience.  When our adventure concluded on day 8 we had bonded with our guides and fellow adventurers and were almost like family.  The worst part of it was when the journey ended and we had to go back to a clock and schedule.  This was truly the vacation of a lifetime that was ""over the top"" with the professionalism and courtesies from AzRA.  We selected our outfitter very carefully and were completely pleased with our trip."
208,Hot time in the old canyon,"I did my second charter all dory 14-night trip with AzRA in August/September 2012 (the first was 2 years earlier).  Both trips were wonderful -- the guides are terrific, know the river very well (two have probably several hundred trips, one was on her 95th trip), know the history of the river, and are great cooks (AzRA provides amazing food).  It is hard to avoid gaining weight on the food!  Two nights had grill-your-own grass fed steaks, wonderful flavor; all dinners were great.  Rapids are very exciting in the dories.  Frequent hikes, appropriate for the ages of the guests (age range 55-75), a number of wonderful waterfalls.  Brad Dimock was on both trips and gave wonderful talks on geology, with great visual effects, as well as on river runner and local history (see his publishing company, Fretwater Press, for his books on river history).  I believe he is usually on the Dories and Stories trips (currently, all-dory trips are done on a charter basis only).  Don't miss a chance to be on a trip with him; he's a national treasure!  AzRA is a first-class organization in every way."
209,A grand experience on the CO River,"...then I recommend go on an AZRA trip.Hint: you will not be a guard. However, you will certainly not starve, and the scenery is glorious."
210,Grand Canyon from the bottom,"I used the Blue Grass angle to get my boyfriend to come rafting in the Grand Canyon. This is a special once a year trip for AZRA. We had concerts daily in caves, side canyons or after dinner in camp. Guitars, Dobro, banjo, ukele, and fiddle. Some musicians were dedicated Raft assistants, some were guests. The music added a special angle to spectacular rapids and scenery. Wonderful staff!"
211,The Grand Canyon is Beautiful.,"Two weeks rafting, camping, hiking and absorbing the beauty of the Grand Canyon settles deep in your soul. Go with AzRA. The guides are knowledgable and fun. You'll explore many side canyons that you may never have known about if you weren't with this amazing team of experienced river people. They're filled with history, stories, jokes, songs, games and they can cook—meals like you won't believe you're eating on a remote beach deep in the Grand Canyon. Gourmet all the way. The Dutch Oven desserts are killer too. From the office staff to the last goodbye in Flagstaff, AzRA is first class. My last trip was in 2006 and I couldn't wait to get back in 2013. We're already talking about going in two years. The rapids are world class. The paddle boat is a hoot, but you don't have to paddle if you're not up for it. The oar boats are a thrilling ride with time to relax between waves and sip a cold drink. The beaches are pristine. Your group is always the only one at each site. No overcrowding. Only perfection. Ahhh."
212,Great trip!,"This was our second trip with AzRA, rafting the Colorado River through Grand Canyon for 14 days via raft. The guides were amazing and lots of fun. The food, music, and beauty of the canyon were awesome. The enormous rapids were navigated safely and were a blast. Neal, Steven, Mace, Faye, Liam, Curtis and Tom were a joy, each adding their own unique gifts to our adventure. LOVE these folks!!"
213,A Truly Grand Adventure!,"My husband and I had been on a lower river rafting trip multiple years ago and decided, at our age, we had one more trip left in us for the Grand Canyon (59 & 65) so, we decided to do the full river! We even got our not so active relatives to join us -- who live TOTALLY live ""techy"" lives. For 14 days, not only did WE enjoy it, but they did too. Okay, it did take about 3 days to TOTALLY  relax and realize we couldn't just google a question!:) We loved the daily hikes, the chatter among all of our new friends (23 of us) and the food was just as awesome as we remember. We had such a cohesive group of people and the teens actually talked to us -- couldn't be glued to their cell phones all day! I can honestly say this was THE first vacation I felt ready to return to work.  Our lead guide, Bev, was skilled, kind, and efficient. Margo, our paddle boat guide, kept us laughing with her energy and wit. Bruce, the most seasoned vet guide, was quiet, kind, skilled and kept us interested with stories his father had written -- he was just an old cowboy who loves the river! Jay had the funniest dry sense of humor and we didn't know at first if he was serious, but his mischievous smiles were infectious. Aaron was the scholar guide and we loved his knowledge of the canyon; Karla, in her last training, was a powerful soul and I loved to watch her row. James, our forever kid, was there to entertain us - a different superhero costume every day!  We felt safe, cared for, and entertained all the way. What beauty to behold each day and definitely a trip of our lifetime! Don't miss out on this one if you are adventurous -- well, even if you're not I think you would find it thrilling, and you might even find the ""inner lion"" in you!"
214,Rafting the Colorada with AzRA,"This trip was the hiker's special 16 day trip, April 2015.  One passenger who was on his 5th river trip runs a company that helps people select an appropriate company and trip.  I don't know whether all his trips were with different companies, but he said that this group of guides worked together better than any other group he had seen, and the food was the best he had had.  Hikes were interesting; the most challenging was an 8-hour hike with 2400' elevation gain (and loss) which required quite a bit of scrambling on the uphill.  Two other hikes were steep 1000' elevation gains to view points.  Advice on the website to hire a personal trainer is excessive; the hikes we did required only good conditioning; several hikes had some interesting scrambling but the guides were there to spot clients.  Guides were very friendly, knowledgeable, socialized with guests very well, really liked each other, and were a lot of fun to be around.  I was on the paddle boat (with no previous relevant experience) almost every day; it is a great way to experience the rapids; our paddle captain was considerate and didn't overwork us.  We did have several rather cold days (I had the same experience on a trip during April last year); appropriate gear is essential at that time of year.  AzRA is a great company and a wonderful choice for a great adventure.  If you do a non-motorized trip, I highly recommend doing a trip with a paddle boat and spending some time on it."
215,Amazing adventure!,"I have hiked to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and spent the night at Phantom Ranch.  I have visited both rims of the Grand Canyon numerous times over the years.  But until this trip with Arizona Raft Adventures, I had never seen or truly appreciated the majesty of the Grand Canyon.From the extensive preplanning assistance, to the very helpful orientation, to the equipment provided at camp each night, to the truely gourmet food (considering where you were), to the absolutely SUPERB guides, this eight day trip was one of the best I have experienced.Who would have thought that getting up at 5:00 AM and going to bed at 8:30 PM was going to be fun?  Since those were the hours of daylight, they quickly became ours.  We fell into a routine where coffee was at 5:30 AM, a remarkable breakfast followed shortly thereafter, on the river around 7:30 AM and holding on for the next of the 106 rapids we encountered.  During the day, we hiked to swimming holes, waterfalls, historical artifacts and hidden springs.  Lunch was always a surprise since who would expect fresh salads at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  Normally, we arrived at a camp site around 4:30 PM, unloaded the raft, set up camp and enjoyed a ‘beverage’ that had been chilled in the 50 degree Colorado River.  Dinners were a highlight…from salmon to pork chops to steaks to name a few selections.Besides for the absolutely astounding scenery around every bend of the river (I shot 2,000 pictures in 8 days), it was our guides that validated selecting Arizona Raft Adventure.  They were extremely knowledgeable, consistently helpful, hard working (by my estimation from 4:45 AM to 8:30 PM) and ALWAYS demonstrated a sense of humor.   Everyone is our group agreed that the expertise of Randy and Margeaux made the difference in making this trip a ‘once in a lifetime experience’."
216,Consistently Superior trips,"Family of 4 just returned from an 8 day motor raft trip from Lee's Ferry to Diamond Creek. Traveled 225 miles on the river. 12 passengers on the raft. Great geology lesson plus great river stories along the way. Camped each night along the riverbed under the stars. No need for tents in early June. Daily side hikes were unbelievable. Hikes to waterfalls, swimming holes, side canyons.Food was great.  Be prepared - you are camping. Bathing in the river and bathroom setup is a real camping experience. Be in good shape. Ages on our trip ranged from 14 to 67. All were capable to complete all but one hike. I brought a waterproof camera. Bring extra batteries."
217,Fantastic trip!,"My 16 year old son and I just got back from the 9 day paddle trip with AzRA (lower half beginning July 11). I have to say that the expectations were really high about a paddle trip on the Colorado and AzRA exceeded our expectations in every way. Just an incredible trip. The pre-trip meeting established expectations and set the tone. We started with a very early hike down Bright Angel Trail and the guide provided great info about the wildlife, history and vistas. Once we made it to the river, our real adventure began. Great Rapids out of the gate and an early camp with orientation. After that it was sleeping under the stars every night, rafting every day and plugging in a hike to a majestic place at every stop. Around every bend literally there was a new adventure, either in the water or on the trail.The guides were awesome and really gauged the participants to make sure we were all getting the amount of excitement that we were looking for. Some people were looking for a more mellow trip and they kind of gravitated to others. My son has a lot of energy and we were looking to hit the big rapids so they helped us by keeping us in the boat that routinely attempted the big water. Kevin, our trip leader also arranged for a 20 mile hike to an old mine to really challenge my son and other avid hikers - while that was way beyond necessary, all the members who attempted it loved it - that just shows you the lengths this crew went to to ensure we got the most out of our trip. After talking to the group on the 14 day (10 of them, 8 got off to hike out on Bright Angel while our 8 hiked on for the lower half, 9 day trip), I would recommend with the full trip 14 day or the lower half 9 day paddle if you are looking for more excitement. The upper has great views and some good hikes but everyone on the full trip seemed to think the lower half was where it was best. In terms of equipment - I would say ""go minimal"" for a July run. Literally maybe 2 long sleeve shirts and maybe 2 pairs of shorts for guys along with essential toiletries. I would also highly recommended a shamwow or hikers towel for each person - keeps you cool at night, along with lotions and sunscreen. I would also recommend a 3 liter came back hydration pack - keep the pack small, a great pair of sunglasses (polarized) with some croakies. I would also say get a pair of chacos sandles and give your feet about a month to adjust - they were great for hikes and my running shoes melted and shredded from the heat and terrain. Also one additional liter water bottle is a must (find a quality one) and a red light headlamp. One final thing is bring plenty of backup batteries and a charging battery for your cameras/go pros etc (there is no cell service in the canyon which is a great break). We had a solar panel and it crapped out after 2 days in the sand and tough conditions - everyone on the trip with a solar charger had the same experience regardless of brand.  Finally I would say anyone who is physically capable, do the paddle trip vs the motor or oar trips. It just adds so much to your experience to be down on the water. After seeing the Grand Canton from the rim 4 different times, I had my reservations about what the canyon offered. This trip made a believer out of me and changed my life, my son's life and created a lifetime of memories. The trip is expensive, but those memories are priceless."
218,Totally awesome,"I just returned from a 14 day trip with AzRA down the Grand Canyon. I can say without a doubt that it was the best two weeks of my life.Our guides were knowledgeable, kind, and made me feel safe at all times. Our trip leader balanced hiking, rafting, and swimming perfectly and always provided options. Even on days with very few rapids, I had enormous amounts of fun on the river.The food was sensation (better than most restaurants) and they accommodated my allergies well. Each night we had a salad, delicious meat, and freshly baked dessert.More than anything, the Canyon itself is breathtaking. AzRA allowed me to enjoy it, discover its history, and protect it's future. Don't go with any other company but them!"
219,9 Day Lower Canyon trip this past April,"We've rafted the Grand Canyon several times.  Twice with Azra.  Our first experience was wonderful, guides were stellar.  Our last trip, which ended 4/22/17 was a mixed experience.  The trip leader was terrible.  The other guides were fine.  The trip leader was not a good rafter, she was disorganized and not very pleasant.  I did not have confidence in her.  Thank God the other boat people were quite skilled.I tried to leave feedback with this company.  They first sent me an invalid link for feedback and then did not respond to my request.  I am not sure if the company is undergoing some changes or if this is just a fluke.  Previous to this last trip I would have given an enthusiastic shout out for AzRA.  Now it is more qualified."
220,Rafting the Colorado through the Grand Canyon,"I was on the May 12 - 25, 2016 Paddle/Oar Trip.  I can't say enough about our River Guides - Liam, Matt, Dirk, Dave, Aaron and Liz; Assistants Sam and Megan. They were true Professionals with years of experience.  They were always concerned about our safety on water and land, and taking care of the environment; they shared their knowledge and love of the River and Canyon by personnel experiences and various books and articles - there was a library available anytime; they guided and helped us through tough situations on the amazing hikes; they took care of our cuts, scrapes, etc; they fed us so well, and made sure good hygiene habits were followed; they were concerned about us in everything we did, and that we were all having a good time.I highly recommend Arizona Raft Adventures, and suggest the 14-day Paddle/Oar Trips.  I can't wait to go again, as every trip is a new experience."
221,Rafting the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon,"To anyone contemplating a Grand Canyon river experience, I highly recommend Azra as your commercial guiding company.  Azra offers a variety of trip styles and length. My husband and I started with their 8 day lower canyon and loved it so much we went back 2 years later for the 14 day full canyon.  Azra does a great job orchestrating the entire trip.  The whole staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The river guides are top notch."
222,14 Day Trip of a Lifetime,"Without a doubt the best way to experience the Grand Canyon is a raft trip down the Colorado River. And the best way to run the river is the All-Paddle rafting trip offered by Arizona Raft Adventures (AzRA).This summer marked my seventh trip with AzRA, and 1,000 river miles. The all-paddle trip this summer was the most fun of all the various types of trips I have been on.Paddling the length of the Grand Canyon might seem like it would be more strenuous than you would want to get yourself into. But if you are in reasonable shape and have an adventurous spirit, it is a very rewarding experience. My fellow travelers ranged in age from 15 to 69. A third were in their 60’s and another third were in their 50’s. So this type of trip is not limited by age. Most had some experience on a raft, although none had been on a Grand Canyon trip before.Paddling averaged about three hours in the morning and about the same in the afternoon. Most of the time you are drifting with the current and not actually paddling. The guides are experts at pacing the amount and duration of your paddling, and I don’t recall anyone saying they were exhausted at the end of the day.What makes this type of trip rewarding is that you are actually an active partner in moving the expedition down the river, just as all the explorers that came before you have done.Probably the best part of a paddle trip is the people you are sharing your adventure with. You are all sharing a common love of the Canyon and the joy of discovery as you progress down the river. The white water rapids are exhilarating, and conquering them together with your teammates quickly bonds the group together and makes for some lively conversation at dinner. Occasionally a paddler will get knocked out of the boat and do a little swimming in the rapids. These people are known as the Swim Team, and have a sort of hero status in camp at the end of the day.  All said they felt well prepared by the guides to safely ride it out until a boat could haul them back on board.The all paddle trip is only offered a few times a year, so you may have to plan a year or two in advance. My wife and I have already booked a paddle trip for next summer. Maybe we will see you on the river!"
223,Oh yes.,"My wife and I shared an amazing raft trip with 14 friends on the Colorado River in Grand Canyon with AZRA. We went on the ""14 Day Classic Adventure"" on oar and paddle rafts with a very experienced crew who not only piloted us through the rapids with great skill, they treated us to poetry, essays and geological information. The crew - Liam, Dirk, Matt, Dave, Aaron and Liz (as well as assistants Megan and Sam) - shared their immense knowledge of the human and natural history of the canyon, led us on utterly remarkable hikes, fed us fantastic meals, and ensured that we wanted for nothing. If I could return to The Canyon with AZRA tomorrow, I would. There are many companies that run the Grand Canyon, but I would urge you to book your trip with AZRA. The company is very well run, with excellent equipment, and outstanding staff. You need no look any further."
224,6-day Upper Grand Canyon rafting trip,"I am so grateful to have just completed the 14 day Expedition white water rafting on the Colorado River in Grand Canyon with aAzra. Every detail was professionally handled by this company. I have never camped and I am a senior citizen so this was a huge undertaking.  The guides are Beyond awesome, the scenery is majestic, the food is amazing, and the attention to detail marvelous. This was the most exciting, challenging, and rewarding trip of my life and I have traveled all over the world. I consider myself to be in decent shape, walk swim Bike yoga daily but the Grand Canyon physically fit is a whole new topic. But the guides were very helpful and I managed very well thanks to their professionalism and genuine care.  The excitement of this trip is off the charts and I highly recommend it as the experience of a lifetime. I will always be so grateful that I did it.  Michelle Walter"
225,10-Day Motorized Trip,"From October 4 - October 19, 2014, I completed the 16 day Classic Adventure (oar & paddle boats) from Lees Ferry to Diamond Creek (226 miles). I traveled all the way from Connecticut to do my first rafting trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.  This trip ranks at the top of my list as the most outstanding and exciting trips that I've ever taken in my life.  Leading up to the trip, I was a little apprehensive and had many questions that needed answering.  The people in the office at AZRA (Erin & Meghan) always responded to my questions in a timely fashion and helped alleviate any concerns that I had pertaining to the trip.  The night before the trip, an orientation meeting is held to further answer any questions that you might have and to explain how the trip works (how to pack your bags, how the bathroom situation works and so forth).  During the entire trip, I found all AZRA employees to be very organized and highly professional.  Our trip leader (Katie...you are the best ever), made sure that all aspects of the trip ran smoothly.  The entire crew acted as a team, a real cohesive unit that made every effort to make your adventure a memorable experience.  From the delicious meals that were served each day, to the spectacular hikes through exotic side canyons, to the other friendly people who shared the trip, to the views of the Milky Way stretching from horizon to horizon under dark, crystal clear skies, to the Desert Bighorn Sheep (which I saw for the very first time close up), this trip exceeding all of my expectations by a long shot.  Our guides (Katie, Neil, John, Shay, Dave, Jeremy, Lexie & Katie), were amazing.  Each day these guides shared their knowledge of the Grand Canyon, its Geology, History, Archaeology, information about various types of plants and animals, information about the rapids and so forth.  There was never a dull moment on this trip.  The trip was exhilarating, educational,  and quite simply amazing.  Based on the richness of my experience, I would heartily recommend this trip to all my friends who like outdoor adventure and don't mind ""roughing it""  for a  few short days. If the opportunity presented itself again, I most definitely would return and would consider only one rafting company... AZRA."
226,16 day non-motorized trip,"Got together a group of 9 (out of 20 rafters) to do the full canyon trip this June, 2018.  This was my fifth time rafting with AzRA. 1993-upper canyon.  1995 full trip.  2009 upper canyon.  2011 lower canyon.  The Grand Canyon, experienced from river level is something few people get to see.  Beauty all around you, austere, spectacular, awe inspiring.  Exhilarating rapids, skillful, passionate guides, entertaining stories. Good food, sleeping under the stars (tents available,) Up when it got light, to bed when it got dark. Two weeks of disconnect from the electronic world of news, chaos and stress.  Plunge into the river to cool off, dry in the sun. Listen to your guide tell the stories of the canyon between rapids: geology, early human pre-history, early explorers and river running, ecology, tragedy and comedy.  Side canyon hiking with waterfalls and deep pools for swimming, acoustics for music and room for frisbee throwing and lemming races. I am in my second day of recovery (adventuring can be physically exhausting,) but the memories and friendships will always be with me."
227,"repeat 16 day fall Hiker's Special, Company provides an outstanding experience","I can't believe I'm writing a five-star review about a trip in 110 degree heat where we had to use the bathroom in a bucket, but I am.  It was spectacular.  The AZRA staff was so cool, so game, so enthusiastic, so knowledgeable.  Our guides, Katy, Bruce, Lauren and Tracy, were tireless, positive, helpful, fun, eco-conscious, and they cooked their butts off.  They ministered to the sick, they inspired the young, they climbed treacherous peaks in flip flops.  This is not glamping; the hikes are not cakewalks, and even though ours was a big-boat trip with no rowing, it was still physically challenging.  But for our group, it was the perfect combination of sweating, swimming, and sitting around in chairs laughing and drinking.  The vistas were jaw-droppingly gorgeous from beginning to end, and thanks to our AZRA friends, every day was a perfect adventure.  We'd love to do it all over again."
228,"15-day full Grand Canyon dory trip: great company, amazing guides","Just returned home from an eight day full canyon motor trip with AZRA.  We flew into Phoenix drove to Flagstaff, spend the night and then boarded the bus for the trip.  Briefly, a fantastic adventure.  We traveled with  two kids age 11 and 14 and the trip could not have been better.  We are not campers but got into the swing of things with the help of our guides.  From orientation the night before to the bus ride back to flagstaff everything was well organized. safe and a blast.  I will skip all the details but most days had rafting, hiking and camping to some degree depending on the day.  You wont be sorry if you go."
229,AZRA 8 Day Motorized Grand Canyon Rafting Trip,"I went for an 8-day motor rafting trip in the canyon. It was SUPERB. The views were amazing, the guides were very accommodating and made almost all of the hikes we wanted a reality, they were very chill and knowledgeable (especially Matt Herman). It was  a great balance between hiking, rafting, and time at camp to socialize. The food was AMAZING. Great variety, and great cooking (probably the only outdoor trip on which I could actually gain weight). Absolutely worth the money."
230,14-Day full canyon hybrid trip exceeded expectations,"I just returned from one of the most fantastic outdoor experiences with AZRA.  My sister and I rafted the top half of the Canyon and my only regret was not booking the entire Canyon trip. I've done a bit of work leading backpacking trips so have some idea of how hard it is to lead a lengthy backcountry trip well, and an idea of how exhausting it is!  The guides were fabulous - knowledgeable, fun, safety conscious and incredibly hard working. They were very aware of how all the participants were doing and seemed to sense how to lead the trip at the right tempo.  Nate, Claire, Dirk, Whalen, Jay were awesome - thank you all!  I saw the post about drinking and camping.  This was not our experience at all.  We had an underage boy on the trip, he was watched carefully.  I thought it was great that AZRA encourages people to bring beverages - not only alcoholic, but also non-alcoholic (we brought both and were very happy we did).  We were on vacation and everyone seemed to enjoy having a drink.  I never saw anyone overdo it, the guides had a beer or two but were extremely responsible and it did nothing to lessen the impact of the beauty of the experience for me.  Regarding the leave no trace camping, it also was flawless.The beauty of the canyon is not to be believed and something I will always remember. I'll be back and I'll use AZRA, and I'll recommend them to others.  If you use them, you won't be disappointed."
231,An adventure you will always cherish,"If  you really want to see all the Grand Canyon has to offer, the only way to see it is from the bottom.  Rafting the Canyon is an amazing experience.  Whether you choose a 6, 9 or 14 day full canyon trip, you will NEVER forget it.  Be prepared to be in top condition if you are going to hike down from the south rim to raft the lower portion of the canyon.  The warnings the NPS give are REAL.  I hiked down (7 miles) from the south rim in 06 in June.  At 8:30 am (I started at 6 from the rim)the temp was 110 degrees at Indian Gardens (Mile 4).  Be prepared for a hike like you have never done before.  When you get to the river the guides, Arizona Raft Adventures, (AZRA) will take care of you for the next 8-9 days.  Full meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner even with Chocolate Cake for desert, all prepared by the guides from AZRA at each campsite. Great storytelling and ,if your lucky, like I was, one of the guides will have his guitar.  Hold on tight because the rapids are like nothing you will ever experience.  Certainly no ""Disney ride."" A longer trip without the hiking down from the rim is a 14 day trip from Lees Ferry.  AZRA busses you from Flagstaff to Lees and then picks you up at Diamond Creek back to Flagstaff.  Be prepared for some great times you will never forget.  I am going back for my third trip this July."
232,Grand Canyon Rafting,"Was thinking about this today, as it's been almost 10 years to the day.  I was 27 at the time, went with my immediate family.  We went on 14-day hybrid (oar and paddle) trip with AzRa in 2002.   We rafted over 250 miles through, essentially, the whole canyon.  As people have said previously, I was not left wanting for anything from their company.  The guides are at the top of their field, especially the ""veterans"".  These people are literal treasure troves not only of information about the canyon and it's history, but also life in general it would seem.  You are guided, but not in the sense to where you feel like cattle.  You have a certain freedom to ""choose your own adventure"" at the camps and side-hikes.  I really can't say enough good things.  We had the last trip of the year, so i think it was even more special for the guides, as they reminisced about the season.  If i had to choose a shorter trip, i'd go with the Upper 8 day.  That way you all get a chance to bond with your group and really experience everything together.  Although, I think the 9-day Lower trip  is probably more exciting in terms of rapids.  I just remember the people who joined our trip in the middle took a while to 'assimilate', as the core group already had been together for a week.   Either way, the guides were all very inviting and helped to ease the process.  If you're on the fence, just go.  AzRa is awesome.  First class all the way."
233,AZRA 9 Day Raft/Paddle trip of the Lower Grand Canyon,"My wife and I had the pleasure of taking a rafting and hiking adventure in the Grand Canyon. We chose AZRA as the company to use based on feedback we read online... and we are not disappointed! This company did an amazing job of delivering exactly what they set out in their trip descriptions. We began the journey in Flagstaff where we met our team and after seven days we left the team (half way) and my wife and I hiked out of the Canyon on Bright Angel Trail up to Grand Canyon Village. From beginning to end we felt organized, cared for, safe, educated, and confident in the skills and purpose of the guides around us. The guides are all very excited about what they do for a living - they love being in the Canyon and they are passionate to protect this beautiful wonder and to educate their guests about it. Whether they are just supremely patient and tolerant or truly this happy all of the time, the guides made us feel like the centre of attention and each took great pains to ""be"" what we needed them to be. They shared their stories (and their gear - Thanks Owen!) and seemed genuinely interested in ours. Lorna, Kate, Kevin, Stephen, Laura, and Owen - you did a wonderful job and we won't soon forget any of you.  The rafting was fun and exciting and safe! The paddling was educational and even more exciting. The hikes were the key for us - aggressive but completely do-able and supremely beautiful! A show worth the cost of admission! Here are some bullets to hurry this review along...FOOD - top notch, fresh and plentiful (steak, chicken, salmon, salads, etc...)Hygiene - much care taken by all for healthy food prep, hand washing, etc...Equipment - excellent! (sleeping bags clean, warm; tents great quality; boats great)Orderliness - very organized from our first email to our last stepping foot of the boatsEducation - from Water Politics to Native American history and issues - the guides shared.Staff - The best! It was nice to watch our guides enjoy their one hour of downtime before dinner each day where they could shut if off, have a pop or other beverage, and not be ""on"" for guests. Sorry guides for intruding on that hour a few times... I just couldn't resist the camaraderie. Thank you for including me!To conclude - AZRA is the way to go!Tobias"
234,Best trip of my life,"My husband, son and I joined AzRA in July 2009 for a lower Canyon hybrid trip.  The crew, of course, could not do anything about the grueling heat, but I'm sure they would have had they been able.  The food was good.  Every one of the guides were helpful and friendly.  They were happy to engage, but also happy to stay out of the way if you preferred to hang with your family.  The side hikes were rather challenging.  Not for the faint of heart or un-sure-footed.  It's an incredible experience to float down the Colorado River.  I recommend it to everyone.   The rapids are hairy, but I felt confident that the guides did everything within their control to ensure our safety.  This is the 2nd trip I have taken with AzRA and am hoping that there will be more in my future.  It was clear that the guides have a reverence for the Canyon which is inspiring."
235,"Going back to ""UnReality"" bites after you go with AZRA!","From start to finish, AzRa is a class act. Although, I have not been on another tour like this before, I can't imagine we could have had better guides, better food, or a better experience overall. We felt safe on the water and on our hiking trips. We were educated on how to keep ourselves healthy and in good shape while in an unfamiliar climate. I would recommend (and will) this to anyone young or old!"
236,All Paddle Trip was fantastic,"We just returned from our 5th Grand Canyon raft trip down the Colorado River. All five have been with AzRA (Arizona Raft Adventures). They have a solid reputation as a premier rafting company, and they work hard to stay #1. AzRA is the company that professional guides want to work for. Isn’t that reason enough to choose them? Here are five reasons to go rafting:Reason Number 5:  A raft trip is less scary, and more fun, than you think. Sure, you need to sensible. Just use the same skills your mama taught you: look both ways before you cross the street. One of the nice things about a river trip is the way fellow guests and guides are always looking out for each other.Reason Number 4: A raft trip is more affordable than you think. A typical vacation involves a hotel, food drink, paying for attractions and a rental car. On the other hand, a raft trip is truly all inclusive. It includes sleeping accommodations (a tent), food (chow), drinks (cowboy coffee and river water), a full day of adventures (hiking sandals), and free transportation (rubber raft).Reason Number 3: You will discover how little you need to be truly happy. Your spirit needs an occasional break from all that electronic information we have become addicted to. Reason Number 2:  Sleeping under the stars. Clear nights and few bugs. Even people, who say they would never dare sleep without a tent, regret not doing it every night once they give it a try.Number One Reason to Raft the Canyon: Run the river, change your life. In a small way or in a big way, a trip through the Grand Canyon on a raft will change you for the better. You will find yourself re-living the adventure for the rest of your life. Some people, like river guides, make it a way of life. Others, like you and me, find ourselves dreaming of a return trip……hope to see you soon."
237,My 2nd trip of a life time with AzRA,"I've been traveling with my family since I was a baby, and this was by far my favorite.  The canyon was beautiful, the guides were both knowledgable and just about the most fun people I've ever met, the food was fantastic, and the hikes were challenging in the best way.  Can't say anything but give rave reviews to AZRA."
238,Awesome Grand Canyon Trip,"I have just returned from my third trip through the Grand Canyon with AzRA.  Simply put, a fabulous trip.  Great food (fresh salad on the last day of a 14-day trip!), and very well organized.  Side hikes were geared to the capabilities of the guests, with opportunities for the more adventurous to challenge themselves.  Most of all, the guides were great. Without fail, they were knowledgeable and caring, not to mention just being nice people.  I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend AzRA.  However, one must be aware that whitewater rafting and sleeping on the ground isn't for everyone.  One has to be prepared for some discomfort, physical exertion, and things like pooping in a box :-)"
239,"10 years later, still the best trip of my life.","We recently took the 9 day lower canyon trip. I went with my son, brother in law and nephew. We started at the South Rim, hiking down the Bright Angel trail. This was a difficult hike, especially in the 110 degree heat. This hike is not for the unprepared or out of shape. We were lead down by an amazing AzRA guide. It was certainly an unforgettable experience. Once on the river, we joined the rest of the group who had started six days earlier at Lee's Ferry (the better choice for those not into major hiking down). The guides were amazing. Every day was an adventure, lots of hikes, waterfalls, surprises and rapids. You can assist with camp or paddling as you want or not. Being detached from the world was great!. The AzRA folks are attentive, kind and very knowledgeable. Experience matters."
240,AZRA Raft Trip--Grand Canyon,"We just returned from a trip with AzRA where we rafted 226 miles over 14 days. We've been fortunate to travel a lot with our kids, but this was one of the best trips we've ever taken. We had never been to the Grand Canyon before. We were blown away not only at the beauty but also at how much there was to do. Each day we felt like that day was the best day yet and wondered what tomorrow could possibly bring to surpass it.The guides added so much to our experience and they all did a fabulous job. John, Laura, Jody, Kristin and Andrew all were amazing (also the assistants Neil and Tiana). They were very knowledgeable about the canyon and we always felt safe when hiking or rafting. We couldn't believe how they were always so cheerful and energetic. Our group included people from 13 to over 60, so activities had to be tailored to different interests and abilities. The guides did a great job offering different alternatives so that there was something for everyone. They could also adapt when the guests showed a special interest in an activity. One day Laura offered a yoga class in the morning. Since it went over so well, they made time for yoga classes on 2-3 more mornings.The food was really great. There was always plenty (actually, I consistently ate too much because there was lots and it was so good). They accommodated the vegetarians, pescaterians and vegans in our group. My kids had a great time. The trip leader John took a special interest in our 13 year old and he just blossomed with this extra attention. He learned how to handle the oars and piloted the boat successfully for several hours on the last day.Rafting the river was thrilling and exhilarating. We were really glad that we had chosen a trip that had a paddle boat option - one of the 5 boats had to be paddled by 6 guests under the direction of a guide. We all took turns paddling and enjoyed it a lot, but my wife and I were also glad to have the option to relax on an oar boat when we felt lazy.Our trip was during the end of June and some days were really hot, even at night. But, it was great to have the option to get in the cold river water at any time to cool off.We felt very fortunate that we had such a great grip of fellow guests. We enjoyed getting to know everyone and miss them already.It's hard to imagine how the trip could have been much better."
241,"Extraordinary, memorable adventure","It has to be the most beautiful place on earth.  AZRA did a great job of keeping us informed from start to finish. The guides took great care of us from keeping us safe, fed, hydrated, shared personal stories and their knowledge of the canyon seemed endless.  I felt their passion for the river and it certainly added to my enjoyment of this trip. I can't wait to back again, and next time it will be for longer and most definitely with AZRA."
242,Adventure of a lifetime,"We went on the upper Grand Canyon hybrid raft trip to celebrate my wife's birthday, and our 38th wedding anniversary. I had some concern about 'sitting' on a raft day after day. As it turned out, the trip was just great. The guides were very professional and friendly, the equipment was first rate. The trip was well planned, with plenty of adventurous side hikes. We loved 'creeking' up the side canyons to waterfalls and pools. The guides were personable, as well, and made us all feel like they wanted to make our trip special. They even baked a birthday cake and an anniversary cake! Can't wait to go again...this time for the whole canyon"
243,Most amazing vacation we have ever had,"If you’ve ever thought of doing a rafting trip through the Grand Canyon, don’t let anything stop you.  If you can, do the whole Canyon (maybe think of J. W. Powell some).  I highly recommend a hybrid trip where you get to paddle the best rapids in North America.  And although I imagine there are some other good tour groups out there, I know you couldn’t do any better than AZRA.  We had a great set of guides who created the perfect balance between fun and safety.  Nice to be around people who enjoy their work so much and are so good at it.   Spend as much time as you can paddling.  I spent most days on the paddle boat and it certainly was some of my best times, especially with our inspirational paddle boat captain Jim.  Great hikes, beautiful water, and a wondrous place for quiet contemplation.  As Summer (one of our guides) would exclaim “what a beaut” of a time."
244,The best experience of my entire life,"Where do I start?  As one of our guides (Alan) wisely said, ""Ask me what time it is and I'll tell you NOW""  ""Ask me where you are and i'll tell you HERE.""  That is pretty much what you need to know to enjoy this amazing life experience.  I would never call this a TRIP or a VACATION because it is so much more.  I have NEVER camped.  I have NEVER been white water rafting.  I have NEVER enjoyed being outdoors as much as I did with AzRA and the crew who took the absolute best care of us.  A huge debt of gratitude to Andrew, Alan, Derek, Bev, Tess, Steve, Heidi and Thomas.  I was very anxious about doing all the ""nevers"" and they quelled that fear.  Derek had me paddling through a rapid on day two!  I hiked, scrambled, traversed all around the canyon - to washes, waterfalls and ancient pueblo sites.  I fell in love with cowboy coffee with honey (thanks Derek!) and Bev and the crew made the most awesome meals for our group of about 30.  The rest of the folks on our trip were also an incredible bunch and I was sad to leave them after our 6 days (7/1-7/6).  They were continuing on for another 7!  I almost.... almost considered calling my office to tell them i was taking another week.  Dear reader of this review.... just know that you will feel exactly as I did.  Balanced and refreshed and changed.  I could go on and on about story time, whiffle ball, sleeping under the stars (the night sky in the canyon is mind blowing) but I won't.  I'll stop here in hopes that you will book your adventure right now!  And please take me with you."
245,Fabulous experience for all,"Just back from an 8 day motor trip on the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon.  Let me first say, I am not a camper however if you want to see all there is to see at the Grand Canyon the river is the way to go.  The Geological information about the Canyon is fascinating.  The hiking from the bottom to waterfalls and  rock formations are a delight.  So it's not all running the rapids.  The Little Colorado river was great fun and such a beautiful color, I am still dreaming about it.  The shooting stars at night kept me from sleeping.  I really did not want to miss anything.  We used a Company that was recommended to us called AzRa and it could not have been better.  The guides were knowledgable and kept us entertained and safe throughout the entire trip.  The meals were a real treat. They even celebrated my husband's birthday with a chocolate cake, banners and candles.  Did I mention they baked the cake at the campsite?!?!  You really need to be in good shape to appreciate all of it.  This is a top notch company!   Arizona Raft Adventures and Grand Canyon discovery.  www.azraft.com"
246,Awesome!,"If you are thinking of rafting in the Grand Canyon, AzRa should be your first choice. From beginning to end this was the most well run, well organized experience. The guides were incredible, fun, knowlegable and patient. Their expertise in the canyon truly added to the amazing experience. I will recommend this company over and over again and can't wait to go again next spring!"
247,Trip of a lifetime (until next time!!) with AzRA!,"The summer of 74, a couple of New Yorkers fed up with a summer Fire Island share house, on a spur of the moment and 100 degree heat and humidity, opted out of the city on to a plane to Las Vegas and then Page to take advantage of a couple of spaces that opened up on a Grand Canyon trip with a company named ARTA (which became AZRA) - run then by the family who runs it now - the Elliots. There we were, two kids (me 28, my girlfriend  24), parachuting from the canyons of NYC to the canyon of canyons - an amazing journey and life experience.  Rafts then were a bit different - two pontoons and long oars, a couple pieces of plywood and some metal bars.  But the canyon and the boatmen and women then were the same as now - simply wonderful human beings.  Words do not paint the most beautiful of the images that will be embedded in your mind, and in the experiences the boatmen will lead you through. While any rafting trip through the canyon will be incredible, and those memories will be great, the effort Rob Elliot and his family and his employees put in to capturing all the canyon is about, will sear the memories into you forever. The knowledge they share - whether you are a  Creationist or Darwinist - will leave you a broader person. As now, even then you had a choice to let the staff do all the work, or pitch-in helping prepare the meals or oar the boats (unless you were paddling and then - well that is a whole 'nother experience) and I can say - don't miss out on being a part of the camaraderie of early morning coffee preparing or working in the ""kitchen"" for incredibly prepared dinners after a day on the river. Just a few short hours into the trip, our first couple of riffles and rapids, and the first experiences with our boatman and fellow trip members,  we both realized that a scant five days after our put-in at Lee's Ferry, my girlfriend and I would be saying good-bye and hiking out at Bright Angel. It only got worse as each day got incredibly better. Each day, each side hike, each taught moment about ""stuff"" in canyon history, geology, and lore, each terrible joke, each great meal, each rapid thrill, each jumping into the icy water to cool off brought us one day closer to saying good bye. It's our last night - about 11PM -  well after our last dinner (Mexican food, real margaritas with ice and real ice cream - go figure) and my girlfriend was sobbing her eyes out with no stop that one could reasonably foresee that this scrawny boatman with long hair and a long, black scraggly beard, quietly came over and tapped her on the shoulder. She looked up at him (pretty sorrowful sight after a few hours of crying)  and he whispered, ""How'd you like to hang out with us for a few more days?"". It took a while to sink in. ""What about equipment"" (there were new hikers coming down to join), she said. ""Not a problem"", he answered smiling. ""What about food?"". ""What about space"" ""What about what about as the stuttering questions continued, and he just said, ""Don't worry"".  She asked about what the owner will say, how will we pay. He looked at her (I was quiet - still blown away, as being a New Yorker in the 70s, no one did anything for anyone back then which is why we took off to the trip in the  first place) and said, ""He won't be worried, you'll pay when you can, and I know it's OK too"". And that was the beginning of my first full canyon experience - brought to me by AzRa. It was an incredible trip - still more ""one day incredible experiences"" after another - more incredible stories and education from the boatmen,  more sharing conversations and state-of-life with the other trip members, more jumping into the paddle raft that we first dragged behind us and then used every day (nothing but nothing beats Lava Falls in a six person raft - well, maybe a kayak but can't vouch for that, and now, Crystal rapid). But saying that, if you go on the trip with AzRa, you'll be saying the same thing. And please, don't feel that a short trip isn't worthwhile, Any number of days you can grab on the river, top part or bottom part, and with AzRa, are worth their weight in gold.Forward again, last day of my first trip - a float out on to Lake Mead - it all changes physically (the sobs, by the way, started up strong again the night before our take-out - so it just wasn't about the length of the trip, you see). But what doesn't change is the experience AzRa and the Grand Canyon gives you. My explanation of the experience of the canyon?  If you go in an atheist, you come out an agnostic. If you go in an agnostic, you come out believing in God. If you go in believing in God,, you come out in tears. No less of that being caused by the extraordinary people who share and lead you through your experience. What about  that scrawny and scraggly guy? Well, he turned out to be Rob Elliot - the second generation owner. No guest on the trip knew, nor did he ""run"" that trip. To us, he was just an ""ordinary"" boatman (frankly, none of the staff at Azra is ""ordinary""). And to the staff, he more than carried his own weight (I clearly remember cleaning and hauling a ""groover"" with him a couple of mornings).  So what happened between then and now? I am no longer scrawny as I was then. I no longer have hair - as I did then. But I had my memories from that first trip - better than any picture. So strong were they, that we came back the very next year for the full trip. A lot had happened in those 12 months between. It was also going to be a special trip for us. She didn't know it. AzRa did. At Poncho's Kitchen - a campsite you may get to stay at - we got engaged. And we had an engagement party with a new group of close friends. Surprisingly, the AzRa boatman were able to get, store, and keep hidden, a number of bottles of champagne that I had asked them to help secure before we got to Flagstaff. That trip too was filled with incredible daily experiences (no two trips are ever the same) - supported by an incredible group of boatman - not including Rob - but on this occasion, his son, Adam, was making his first trip as an assistant boatman. The memories, to this very day, are still bright and strong of that trip too, but the marriage faded (our friendship did not though, for all these years). Now, she is a great mom to two wonderful daughters and has a wonderful husband of over 20 years). I know we still share the same memories of the Grand Canyon trip with AzRa. Time passed. It was the mid nineties. I have a son - just turned 4. But new changes had and were occurring. The relationship that brought me a wonderful son, was dissolving. I had lost my dad, grandmother, and then mom within five months. I closed my business and was staring at some difficult neck surgery. It was time. I called AzRa. They had one space on a two week paddle trip. I signed. If there was one place to help me figure out where I was bound, it was in the canyon with the people who helped me experience it first. I stayed alone on that trip a lot. You see, you can do that and it is ok. It was a healing, for me, trip. I saw the canyon in a whole different light. Interestingly, a guy with a big straw hat and salt and pepper hair was on the trip. No longer scrawny, no long hair and beard, it was Rob. After a few days, most people knew what space I was in, and they were great to me. I wrote  letters to my son every night on special stationary I had prepared and carried in with me, each with a different quote from John Wesley Powell in the header- the first batch was going to be muled up and mailed from the canyon rim. I wouldn't get to speak to him until Phantom Ranch. I took my Polaroid camera with me (you have no idea what we are missing without that wonderful camera that lets you see, share, and pass around instant memories with, on the spot, with people you love), so I could mail my four year old pictures of the canyon with a promise that some day, he'll come down that river with me. One night, Rob wrote Aaron a letter inviting him as well. It was a beautiful letter. We took out at Diamond Creek then. I was a different person. This trip made a world of difference (there were a lot of nights on the river  when I was ""talking"" to my Mom, Dad, and Grandmother  - making promises to them of how I was going to take care of their only grandson). I returned home filled with new energy, new calmness, new focus. It was all part of that trip and I know that the members of AzRa helped shape that experience. Things turned out OK. Aaron and I went on his first river trip arranged by AzRa when he was five. I had a new and wonderful wife and we are still together - blended family, and extended family.  12 years passed. It was 2006. Aaron's 16th birthday had come, was celebrated and gone in January. But there was one more major gift to come that summer. One that would last longer than any ""thing"" we could give him. For Aaron's 16th birthday, it was AzRa and the Grand Canyon.  I know a 16 year old has different perspectives on life that one who is 62, so all I can tell you is that I do know his first river trip affected him as deeply and positively as mine did.  We both experienced incredible hikes, swims, stories from the staff, conversations about life, quiet times and wild water fight times. I was back in the ""kitchen"" (even got Aaron in - every so often). It really did influence him as the very next year he was back on his own rafting trip (he helped pay for) with Grand Canyon Youth - a NFP that the Elliots help support. Yet another person influenced by the canyon and by AzRa. What next? Well, this year I became a Beatles birthday person. Aaron is 20 and going to be a junior in college, his sister - graduated and out working. 2011  is pretty seminal - 65 for me, 21 one for him. It's time. And it will be with AzRa. I keep wishing that I could take Aaron's step mom and sister too - however let us say that I made the mistake of insisting on a  honeymoon river trip on the Middle fork of the Salmon -- with kids 7 & 8 -- NOT a bright move - especially when my new wife was looking for a tree with an electric socket for the hair dryer -- at every campsite. Some things are just not in the cards and a post card from the edge, in that case, will serve nicely.  AzRa and the canyon have touched a good portion of my life.    Maybe, on this next trip, I'll get to meet the rest of the Elliot family who now run AzRa. And if I don't get to meet them,  I know one thing: Aaron and I will be with a team, an extended family of dedicated and caring river runners who are as passionate and knowledgeable about the river, and dedicated to insuring an extraordinary and safe experience for the people in their care, as the owners of Azra are.  THAT is the best review and recommendation I can give."
248,8 Days Off-the-Grid,"A couple of friends and I took a 225 mile 8-day motor trip thru the Grand Canyon with AzRA.  If you're looking for a totally off-the-grid experience, this is it.  It was like living in a postcard.  We bathed in the cold river, slept under the stars, and ate amazing meals prepared by the river guides.  AzRA is a top drawer outfitter and will attempt to meet your every need as you while away your day floating down the river.  Our group consisted of about 23 people, including guides.  We entered the Colorado River at Lees Ferry as strangers, and came off the river at Diamond Creek as a new tribe.  It was a most awesome experience!"
249,Awesome Rafting trip,"I experienced the Colorado and Grand Canyon with AZRA in May 2009.Rafting the Colorado river through the Grand Canyon is certainly one of life's great experiences and choosing the right rafting company can be the difference between a good trip and a great trip.   I am very happy I chose AZRA as they had a great group of very experienced guides who kept things in the perfect balance of fun, entertaining, challenging and informative.  you never have any doubt these guys know what they are doing.  I can't recommend both this trip and AZRA enough."
250,Great Adventure,"My husband and I went on the 14 day classic adventure in April of 2018. The 14 day classic trip allows you to experience both the upper and lower canyon. I wouldn't have wanted to miss any of it. The white water is only one part of the trip. The scenery, the geology, the flora and fauna, and the hiking make this an outstanding trip. I really appreciated the professionalism and knowledge of the guides. The trip was exceptionally well organized and the food was excellent! Usually, you have to book far in advance, so I would encourage anyone who is interested to call Arizona Raft Adventures and book as soon as you know you want to go."
251,"When we go back, we will use AZRA again","My husband and I rafted the upper canyon with AZRA in the fall of 2008 and it was without a doubt an incredible experience. The guides did such a great job from day one communicating what to expect and teaching everyone about the history and nature in the Canyon. The guides really put everyone at ease and allowed us to enjoy the experience in their own individual way. They take care of all the details (like the meals which were great), the packing, the planning, etc. so that you can just take in the beauty and experience everything since it is truly overwhelming at times- in a good way.. The days were spend mostly on the rafts (mine was an all paddle trip) with stop offs for hikes, lunch breaks, etc. The evenings were spent at ""camp"" which was usually a beautiful sandy beach where we set up our tents and the kitchen area. Overall I can't say enough about how great the experience was and I think that AZRA played a huge part in making everything seem so seemless. We are booked for a full canyon trip this fall and I can't wait!"
252,Fantastic,"If you are considering a rafting trip, do not hesitate! We just had the time of our lives on a 6 day upper half classic with AZRA. SO MUCH FUN.  We've done a fair amount of Grand Canyon hiking, but the river takes you to many many places you'll never see any other way. The AZRA team took care of us in every way, the guides were super cool and knowledgable, professional, and FUN. Have I mentioned the FUN? They put me totally at ease and before I knew it, I was giggling through the rapids. We will definitely be back for more good times with AZRA."
253,4 trips - seamless memories - # 5 coming soon,"I'm at a loss for words to describe what an amazing adventure this was!  My husband and I just returned from an 8-day motorized trip with AZRA.  Even though my husband worked as a guide through the canyon many years ago and with a couple of other companies, we made a very good choice going with this group!  The crew was great, friendly and very knowledgeable about the canyon and it's geology.  The food was wonderful and we have become great friends with many of our fellow rafters!  I had been waiting for over 30 years to do this trip and it was much more than I could have imagined!  The scenery was breathtaking and provided a new adventure every day.  I'm very glad we chose AZRA and highly recommend them to anyone considering a trip down the Colorado River through the mighty Grand Canyon!"
254,Ready for the Great American Adventure? Grand Canyon and AzRA,"We're just off the river from a two-week All Paddle rafting trip on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon with AZ Raft. We've done the usual tourist visit to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and spent a few minutes gazing in wonder at the Grand Canyon. Rafting the Colorado through the Canyon is a totally different, amazing, and fulfilling experience. It is the River and Canyon at their core. It was thrilling, scary, and educational experience. We felt safe and well-cared for by AZ Raft. Not for the faint of heart, out of shape, or unprepared, mind you."
255,A trip of a lifetime,"We've done the upper and lower hybrid trip over the past couple years.  I cannot say enough about AZRA, the guides (and helpers) and the entire experience.  It can be life changing.  They do an excellent job balancing time on the water, day hike and at camp.  The day hikes can be spectacular, or stay behind and chill.  The food along the entire trip is great, their ability to provide fresh food over a couple week period still amazes me.Writing a review here is insufficient to fully describe the overall experience provided by a trip.  My advice would be if able, do a oar/paddle/dory trip.  The periods of quiet and serenity of floating silently are experiences that are nearly impossible to replicate.AZRA has been great to work with, good communication leading up to the trip, solid coordination all around, very professional.  I'll use them again."
256,This was a life changing experience and AzRa is simply the best!,"My wife and I completed a six-day upper Canyon rafting trip with Azra. I can't recommend it highly enough. The boat guides were just excellent; we felt very safe with them. The guides had useful information about geology and we're always cordial and respectful. Not to mention the awesome meals they prepared.!  This company is just terrific, from the pretrip orientation through to the guide who assisted us on the Bright Angel Trail. Just an amazing experience!"
257,Amazing Grand Canyon Rafting with AZRA,"I took this trip with my family, and I can honestly say that it has been the highlight of my life thus far. We took an 8 day motor trip down the Canyon, and from the very moment we stepped onto the AzRA bus to take us to Lee's Ferry, I felt like I was surrounded by kind, caring, and knowledgeable staff. Even our bus driver was a guide himself, who gave us helpful tips and told us about some early history of the Canyon. Our trip guides were simply some of the best people I've ever met. We still keep in contact with them! Their love and passion for the Canyon is evident in everything they do; they care as much for the environment as they do their guests. They took us on fabulous side hikes and to beautiful grottos that were unavailable to some of the larger commercial raft trips. And when our activities for the day were done, they doubled as some fabulous chefs- we had hamburgers, home made garlic bread, and even fresh baked cake- all in the bottom of the Grand Canyon. If you want to raft down the Grand Canyon, AzRA is the best company to do it with. They are simply fabulous!"
258,Rafting with AZRA,"I rafted the Upper Half to celebrate a 40th birthday in 1998, and the Lower Half, then years later, to celebrate a 50th. This year I asked myself why I was waiting for 2018, and booked myself into a June trip to celebrate my 60th birthday, one year early. All three of the trips I have done have been as a single guest: I highly encourage anyone who's equivocating about doing the trip on their own (with the AZRA group, that is), to go ahead. Do it! Your fellow travellers will be accommodating about sharing room in the rafts, and when we camp, we all look after one another. Without getting too ooga booga about it: for me, the trip is always transformative, challenging, and the beauty of the river and the canyon feed my soul and re-establish perspective and equilibrium in my life. I can't recommend AZRA highly enough, this was my third trip with them and the company's organizational skills, attention to detail, and staff continue to impress me.I'll be back."
259,Go With the Best,"Millions of people have visited Grand Canyon National Park, but less than 1% of them have travelled to the Colorado River at the bottom of the canyon. My wife and I, along with two friends, are fortunate to be of the few people who have experienced being at the bottom and have rafted the Colorado. We made this amazing trip in June 2017 with Arizona Raft Adventures on an 8-day motorized trip.  There were 25 guests and 5 crew members on 2 large pontoon rafts.The experience was outstanding and the trip of a lifetime, made possible by AZRA’s excellent preparation and the fantastic crew (Ariel, Owen, Simone, Maggie and Lindsay). When I looked for a company to take us on our trip, I chose AZRA because of its reputation as one of the premier outfitters for Grand Canyon river rafting trips, the variety of dates and types of trips it offered, and the convenience of being based out of Flagstaff instead of Las Vegas or other locations.  I made reservations 19 months before our trip to secure the dates we wanted, and chose a motorized instead of a paddle trip because we wanted to do the full canyon in a week versus 14 days.  We went in early June when it was hot and sunny but not unbearably hot.  We kept cool by frequent exposures to the cold water and use of cover-ups like sarongs and cotton clothing.  Along the river each day, we stopped at scenic spots for hikes, lunches and to camp.  While most folks chose to sleep out in the open, we slept in a tent to give us some privacy and to contain the ever-present sandy conditions.  Three times a day the crew made unbelievably fresh, wholesome and delicious meals.  More importantly, they were always professional, friendly, informative, efficient and very aware of our health and safety.Every aspect of the trip was perfect from the spectacular views, travelling past billions-year-old geologic formations, the thrilling runs through nearly 100 rapids (some mild, some massive), and the awesome side hikes to places like the Little Colorado and Havasu Creeks, Elves Chasm, Redwall Canyon, and historic Phantom Ranch.  (Motorized trips usually bypass Phantom Ranch, but we stopped and can now say we’ve been there.)  The rafting trip was a fantastic “bucket list” experience, made more memorable by the excellent guides and amenities provided by AZRA.   I highly recommend Arizona Raft Adventures for a Grand Canyon rafting trip."
260,Fabulous!  The trip of a lifetime!,"Words can barely express. Rafting down the Grand Canyon has to rate as one of my all-time greatest experiences. And Azra are the best. Fantastic and knowledgeable river guides, scarily efficient organisation, great food (goodness knows how they managed to still be serving fresh salad and meat 14 days down the river in >100 degrees temperatures!), and just the right balance of adventure and pure luxury. These guys are real professionals - I cannot recommend them too highly."
261,AzRA is the best ...,"We did a 10-day motorized raft trip on the Colorado River through Grand Canyon.  It was fantastic.  The crew was excellent in every respect, and the food was outstanding.  We were continually surprised by what the people were able to provide in the wilderness.  Tents, sleeping bags, pads, chairs -- you name it.  Our trip leader, Wayne Ranney, is a first-class geologist who made the trip so much more interesting.  Spectacular places like Elves' Chasm, only reachable by river, were especially memorable."
262,Trip of a Lifetime,"This was our second trip with AZRA. The first time we did the upper half in April. This time we did the whole canyon and because we decided to share this experience with our kids we had to go in June. Turned out to be a record heat wave. We still had the time of our lives. I actually think the tougher weather conditions demonstrated how great AZRA's guides really are. The canyon and rapids are as exciting and beautiful as ever, but our trip leader and his team managed to get us safely through many wonderful hikes, and fun water oriented experiences well timed to fit with the conditions. Because of the heat we had leisurely camp mornings, long days on the river or in side canyons, and got into camp after the sun had left the beach. The guides were universally helpful and upbeat, and the food was exceptional.  Every level of adventurer had a wonderful time. I really cant wait to go back. You cant beat this trip and this raft company."
263,Amazing Grand Canyon Rafting with AZRA,"The Colorado River through the Grand Canyon can only be seen from river level on a raft or boat. The 16 day raft trip we took was a full-on wilderness adventure, completely off the grid and out of communication for that time.  The spectacular grandeur of the Canyon, the wonderful sympatico guests, group socialization, stories and jokes, history and geology shared by staff each day, great guides and splendid organization of the AZRA trip made the periodic discomforts a small price to pay for the experience (3 days of chilly rain, sleeping on the ground for 16 days, and occasional shivering and sweating).This type of rafting involved a choice of boats - sitting in the front or back of an oar boat rowed by a guide, or being one of six guests in the paddle boat supplying the horse power through rapids, over calm waters, and into occasional stiff head winds.  The front of the rafts guarantee regular icy soakings from large and small rapids, and the large rapids offer the risk of being thrown into the river.  But this was just the kind of trip I wanted - a quick trip down the river in a big motor boat seemed not to offer the kind of adventure running the river that I wanted.This trip involved pitching in, by helping load and unload boats each day, setting up and breaking down individual camps in the afternoon and morning, and helping to wash dishes in the evening.  Prior camping and hiking experience will help guests settle into life on the river in this remote and harsh environment.AZRA was excellent in its organization, skill of the guides, quality of the 3 meals provided each day, itinerary (particularly the many challenging spectacular hikes), and the clockwork precision of the whole experience.  They have been doing this for a long time, and it shows.  The AZRA website is excellent and gives a good sense of what is involved."
264,Fabulous time on the river...,"I've just finished a 14-day non-motorized raft trip on the Colorado through the Grand Canyon with AzRA, and I cannot say enough good things about it. The pre-trip reservations, docs, references, orientation were very detailed and help set appropriate expectations. The guides were a total delight, knowledgeable about the geology, history and biology of the area, as well as skilled boatmen and women. The food was divine, and although I didn't require any special dietary restrictions, others did and they were accommodated very well. Side hikes were described well in advance, with variations available to suit different abilities. Safety and hygiene matters were handled as graciously as possible--imperative on a trip where people are self-supporting over a two-week period. Post-trip logistics were not stinted either--our luggage and even our hotel keys were waiting for us on our arrival back at the hotel. This was a great trip with a great company."
265,AZRA a great way to experience the river,"A friend of mine organized this 8-day motorized rafting trip down the Colorado River from Lee's Ferry to Diamond Creek as her 30th birthday celebration. And what a celebration it was! The twelve of us - from newcomers to seasoned adventurers in the Grand Canyon - had an amazing time rafting, swimming, hiking, and eating our way down 226 beautiful miles of the Canyon.We were definitely pampered - the food was amazing, and the accommodations were the best I've had out in the Wild. Our knowledgeable & friendly guides knew everything there was to know about the Canyon, and ensured that we experienced all the highlights of the Canyon as we passed through. All in all, AZRA did an excellent job of making this an enjoyable and approachable trip, regardless of prior experience, knowledge of, or travels in the Grand Canyon. Highly recommended.Shout out to Matt, Kelly, & David (our wonderful guides) for an unforgettable trip!Now, to planning our next outing..."
266,A wonderful way to see the Grand Canyon,"If rafting the Grand Canyon is on your bucket list of things to do, AzRA Is the one to go with. They will satisfy your need for adventure and create lasting memories for a lifetime. The guides are extremely knowledgeable about the rich history of the canyon and shared lots of details on rock formations, Native American history, historical characters who traveled the Colorado River, the huge variety of wildlife and let’s not forget the rapids!  Each and every day, the trip down the river was a unique experience. We were traveling with two families and a total of six kids, from youngsters to teenagers. The guides Freddie, Jan and Delaney easily accommodated all age levels and made it fun for everyone. There was hiking up slot canyons, hiking to waterfalls that pounded your skin with the force of the water, beautiful vistas that words can’t even describe and huge caverns for the “ultimate” in ultimate frisbee.  With everyday being a different adventure so was the camping experience. After traveling to different places throughout the day, the evenings provided some hiking if one wanted or some time to relax and reflect on the day, When coming into a camp sight everyone helped to unload supplies and get set up. We were in the canyon during the summer solstice so sleeping under the stars was the only way to camp for us. I have never seen so many stars, falling stars and a comet which made the trip that much more magical. The guides were such a huge part of making this trip so special. Every day they made sure everyone was happy and all of our needs were met. From the first cupof coffee before sun-up to the wonderful dutch oven deserts long past nightfall, they were always working. Thank-you AzRA for a most amazing experience in the height of Covid!"
267,The one trip you MUST take in your lifetime!,"Arizona Raft Adventures offers first-rate guided raft trips on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.  Our 2-week primitive trip was exceptional in every respect - from trip planning until they delivered us to the DoubleTree after we took out.Office staff were all extremely knowledgeable and helpful as we began planning our travels to Flagstaff.  They went out of their way to accommodate our group's particular needs and seemed genuinely interested in being helpful.The trip leader and guides were tops.  They were professional, knowledgeable, enthusiastic, interesting, engaging, encouraging, competent, friendly, efficient and fun.  They guided oar rigs and one paddle raft for our group of 21.They guided our river craft masterfully through the most difficult rapids and gave us guidance on rowing the smaller ones.  (Many of us wanted to try rowing.  We paddle whitewater canoes and kayaks but not rafts.)The guides knew the geology and history of the canyon.  They made it come alive in so many ways.  The side hikes they led were incredible.  We hiked to some of the most beautiful places we have ever seen.  And played in the water like 12 year old kids.  The guides taught us bouldering techniques we never thought we would use.The food was very tasty and nutritious.  For birthdays, they even baked birthday cakes in dutch ovens.  And, we had dressup nights, too.Great crew.  Wonderful wilderness experience.  Safe and secure.  Good equipment.  Phenomenal experience.  Trip of a life time.  Thanks, AZRA."
268,Colorado River thru the Grand Canyon -- the most awe inspiring place!,"The view of the Grand Canyon from the top of the South Rim may be mesmerizing, but nothing (NOTHING!) beats the experience of hiking and rafting in her depths. My husband and I researched and planned the trip for over a year, finally selecting Arizona Raft Adventures as our guides - which, in our opinion, made all the difference. We wanted a ""real"" rafting trip, one that we could feel proud of, so we chose the ALL PADDLE trip. Due to timing restrictions and wanting the largest rapids possible (like the infamous Lava), we embarked on the 9-Day Lower Canon trip. From our arrival in Flagstaff, to our final celebratory post-trip dinner, AZRA made sure all the details were taken care of (even the perfect packing list and night before meeting). After spending the night at the top of the trail (and staying up late to read ""Deaths in the Grand Canyon"" - don't ask me why) we left in the early morning for the 8 mile hike down the Bright Angel Trail to the waiting rafts. *Note - if you have bad knees you may need to prepare for this. I'm not going to lie - parts of the river are HARD WORK, and some of the side hikes push you to your personal limit, but even after traveling the world this trip remains our favorite thus far. The food was AMAZING (restaurant worthy food in a camp site - still hard to believe), the guides fun and comical (and professional and knowledgeable), the views magical, and the sense of accomplishment unbeatable. We can't recommend AZRA highly enough (and will continue to spread the word to all we meet). We hope to return with our daughter once she is old enough, and will definitely contact AZRA directly."
269,They are the best in the world,"I took the full trip down the Colorado River with AzRA  from Lees Ferry to Diamond Creek last Fall.  In all honesty it was the trip of a lifetime.  Arizona Raft Adventures prepared me on what to expect, both prior to the trip and on the water.  I was on a photography specific trip and the images we all got were terrific.  The efficiency of the staff and the pains they took to ensure all had a fabulous trip was really amazing.  While the trip was physically demanding on me (66 yrs old) at no time did I feel that I was in any jeopardy or danger.  The staff was exceptional...I have never seen 4 people work together in such unison.  And the food?  It was like a land cruise.  I have no idea how they managed to provide 3 delicious meals a day with snacks in between but they sure did.  I would do this trip again in a heartbeat.  I was back on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park again a couple of months later.  I will never look at the river in the same way now that I know what is down there..."
270,Amazing adventure.,"My husband and I found a couple last-minute spots (cancellations) on an early-May 2017 six-day rafting trip and went for it. Honestly, we didn't have any real expectations for the trip. We are typically hikers, not rafters, so we are beyond delighted at how much we loved everything about this trip. Arizona Raft Adventures was so organized, the guides very professional, the food tasty, and the Canyon beyond words! We didn't know anyone on the trip going in but our group and the guides were fantastic. We were sad to leave and want to come back for the whole-canyon trip (upper and lower) next time. We loved the early-May time slot. The weather was great (mostly blue sky and 80's during the day, good sleeping weather, and amazing flowers in bloom everywhere). Plus, the river wasn't crowded. On day six, we left the Colorado River and hiked out of the Grand Canyon to the South Rim on the Bright Angel Trail. This is challenging with a big pack (all our clothes, etc. from the trip) but doable—just make sure you are in good physical condition and take your time. It is a pretty hike but 4500 feet in altitude gain so be ready. We stayed that night at the El Tovar on the rim and recommend staying on the rim. Taking a hot shower and heading to the El Tovar dining room for dinner and a rim walk was the ideal way to end this trip. We liked our group of rafters so much that we hung out together that evening as well. If you are thinking about rafting the Grand Canyon, do it! We highly recommend Arizona Raft Adventures. Nate was our head guide and really great—all the guides were."
271,River rafting on  the Colorado river,"Ok, I can't really say that AZRA is the best, because I haven't sampled the myriad of companies that provide Grand Canyon trips, but I can say that AZRA was astoundingly good, and exceeded my expectations.  Furthermore, our group of 18 guests had *many* repeat AZRA guests (one with more than ten trips), so I'm leveraging their broader experience base in making my recommendation.The guide staff (we had six guides and two assistant guides) was remarkable, providing a breadth of different experiences (with many having been river guides all over the world) and expertise (geology, history, biology, poetry) but united in their love of the GC and their dedication to making the guest experience the best possible.Food was plentiful and of high quality, without being ""fancy"".  AZRA was cognizant of and embraced the particular food needs of some of my fellow-guests.Our particular trip was the 16-day, full canyon, hiker's special.  This meant that we got a couple of extra days to slow down and do more hiking.  Stunning.  The side canyons were my particular interest, and this trip provided a perfect match.Grand Canyon trips are adventure travel, and that means that a large part of your experience is beyond the control of the guides and the company you use.  This includes weather (we had no rain (unusual), but a couple of windy days which could be described as ""difficult"" in rowing/paddling against the wind down the river, and ""sandstorm"" while in camp).  This also includes water quantity (the amount of water being released by the dam + the inflow from side canyons) and quality (varying from clear green to murky brown).  Some of the hikes are ""sketchy""; you should be clear with the guides on your own boundaries and concerns; participation is always optional, and our hikes were adapted to the abilities and needs of the group.Pay attention to their packing list.  Bring the low end of quantity and plan to rinse/dry your gear at the end of each day.  A clothesline and clips was handy for us -- sometimes you're just clipping to bushes."
272,Rafting the Grand Canyon; Incredible!!,"This company offers top-notch, unsurpassed rafting trips on the Grand Canyon's Colorado River. Friendly, knowledgeable guides.They cook excellent meals and even dessert! This was my fourth trip with them in the Canyon and I wouldn't use anyone else.
