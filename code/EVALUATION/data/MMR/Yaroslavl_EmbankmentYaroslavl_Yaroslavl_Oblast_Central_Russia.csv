0,Unmissable if you are in Yaroslavl !!  Especially good for photo buffs.,"We saw this lovely city on our conducted tour around the Golden Ring, and we were here for one night and half a day.  In my opinion, the BEST thing, by far, in Yaroslavl was the riverside walk along the Volga River.  One of the best riverbank walks I have experienced, anywhere in the world.  The river looks great, and there are some very interesting churches on the walk, apart from some other beautiful buildings.  Very very photogenic.  Even in bad weather!  If it is a nice sunny day, you could not ask for more!  Remember, this city is over a thousand years old, our guide regaled us with plenty of stories of the past.  It is the biggest city between Moscow and the Arctic."
1,Watch your step!,"When on our river cruise, we docked for a few hours at this historic place and enjoyed the short visit very much"
2,Golden Ring for everyone Russian  trip ,We have walked here on a sunny September day and a snowy March day - both were beautiful. The views of the frozen Volga were stunning and all the church domes are beautiful
3,Lovely Views of River,Another location visited on our river cruise and quite simply clean and beautiful gardens with amazing scenery.  Well worth a walk around.
4,Wonderful Views,"We had clocked the embankment from the boat and again when we stopped to admire the peninsula.  I planned to use our free time to stroll along it.  However, by the time we had finished our tour of old Yaroslavl and had a comfort break I was not confident enough of being able to have that stroll and still meet our bus on time.  Maybe if I had checked out the lie of the land beforehand I could have agreed to go directly back to the boat.  It looked lovely."
5,A beautiful walk ,",I strolled just a short section of this embankment promenade, probably the prettiest part. This section overlooked the Yaroslavl Millennium Park with its fountains and Yaroslavl Millennium Monument and was in the vicinity of the Assumption Church. Along this stretch a white columnar folly looking like a small Greek Temple was an obvious sight. Couples liked to attach locks on the black wrought iron fence that surrounded it as a show of their love for each other. Many of the locks have inscriptions making this an interesting stop. At this point on the walkway, a good view of the many green domes of the St. John Church can be seen and makes for a good photo with the Yaroslavl Millennium Monument in the foreground. Some vendors have kiosks with souvenirs for sale along here. The area is attractive with several floral beds filled with colorful seasonal annuals; one even had a design of Yaroslavl's symbol, the brown bear in it. The walkway at this point was treed, shady, with nice views either to the park and the Assumption Church, over to the spit and the Church of St. John, or along the Volga River with its industrial section evident in the distance. The evenly paved walkway was wide so dodging others on it was not an issue. I enjoyed my short time on the Yaroslavl promenade and the sights seen from several vantage points."
6,Beautiful Volga,"We visited Yaroslavl during a Volga River cruise. It's a fascinating, quite large, regional centre and made an interesting contrast to Moscow or Saint Petersburg.  The well organised excursion included visit to the embankment, to churches and to a restored mansion where we were treated to a concert."
7,A beautiful location to view the Volga River and the lovely gardens.,"A lovely proper Russian city of approximately 600,000 people which is ideal for a visitor to see hoe Real Russians live. Not too touristy."
8,Wonderful! ,It is really a great place to walk and to admire the Volga river! You will never regret the time you’ve spent there! Worth the visit!
9,Lovely walk by the river ,Nice place to stroll (although we were there in October so not that warm!) with lovely views of the Volga river
10,Most popular destination in the city,one of the best banks ever seen in my travel: soviet policy preserved banks from buildings and it appears now as an example of what our european cities with river could have been (included rome and florence)
11,Gorgeous riverfront ,"This medium sized city is full of culture, history and historic sites. I only visited the older, touristy part of the city and it was very nice and felt very safe. I particularly enjoyed the area referred to as the Embankment. Beautiful church, pretty park grounds, very nice views, war memorials and other attractions make it great for a walk-- whether or not the actual historical facts are of interest. The upper and lower levels are both spacious and well landscaped. I'd recommend starting in the upper area and after an hour or so make the decision to descend a long staircase to be closer to the river. A picnic and 2 hours of strolling would make a great outing on a nice day."
12,walk walk walk,"Beautiful day to view the area and the bear made of flowers.  A stunning vista in north-central Russia.  Many sites to visit nearby.  Don't forget to rub the wishing stone nearby the newly-rebuilt church, Assumption Cathedral (Uspensky Sobor).The first wooden cathedral was built here in 1215, destroyed by fire it was then rebuilt in the 16th Century and was completely destroyed again in the 20th Century by the Soviets.  In 2005 it was decided to rebuild the cathedral once again and in an astonishing feat of construction the huge building was completed in just five years. The interiors of the church are now white washed with a few icons covering the walls and a new iconostasis and some wealthy locals have donated their antique icons to the cathedral which are on display. Just outside the cathedral’s original bells have also been assigned a place."
13,Missed the opportunity,After a hectic days travel we enjoyed a stroll alongside the Volga. Pleasant views and scenery.A good way to end the day.
14,Very neat place to take a walk.,"I think Volga embankment is the most popular place in Yaroslavl to go for a walk with your family or friends. You can rent bikes or roller skates or just stroll. There are couple of good restaurants close by and the meeting point of Volga and Kotorosl rivers is beautiful, decorated with colorful fountains and flower beds."
15,A nice typical riverfront,"We took a walking tour of Yaroslavl and stared out along the embankment. Beautiful walkway bustling with all sorts of activities. Buy an ice cream, sit and watch the world go by from a park bench, indulge in an array of souvenirs, or just walk and take in the beauty of the day."
16,Excellent for a stroll.,"We walked up here from the park at the ""strelka"" (where the two rivers join).  It is a nice stroll, with several souvenir kiosks along the way.  We ended up eating lunch at a restaurant on the pier, then booking a seat on the water taxi to cruise up to a monastery at Tolga.Not alot of touristy stuff to see along the Volga, but it is a nice river front area, very typical, but also nicer than many others I've seen."
17,Very beautiful,One of the nicest walks we had around Yaroslavl. Volga river is very impressive and the sunset is beautiful.
18,The one and the only,"Nice, all main sights along the way, interesting and picturesque. The best way to enjoy the feel of Yaroslavl."
19,Very nice view,"Walking along the embankment by the Volga was a lovely way to spend a few hours. It is such a pretty walk with gardens, fountains etc along the way, and beautiful views of the river. We even hired electric scooters to enjoy another loop around the embankment and this was great fun!"
20,Nice stroll,Everybody knows Volga and it's a symbol somehow in many Russian arts through time. Can't skip walking along it if you haven't had the chance to visit it somewhere else in Russia
21,Shaded promenade a joy to walk along,"The Yaroslavl Embankment is a very nice place to walk along the River Volga.  Nothing very special, just nice."
22,Nice place for strolling at leisure,great views when the river has frozen great for pictures or artists for paintings saw a lot of photographers enjoying the view
23,Walk the Embankment ,"One of the most important Russian little charming cities , the capital of Golden ring, I recommend to stay in this city at least for 2 days , as it’s so nice to study about Russian history ( city is more 1000 years old!!!! ) and you can see this city on the Russian note ( guess which one ) Really impressed"
24,Must visit,"I like this place. Been visiting Yaroslavl' numerous times during last forty years and always try to come here. Not a lot has changed around - same stunning views on the Volga river, same charming trademark pavillion, same gorgeous trees and same sidewalks in need of repair, scarce kiosks with souvenirs and almost total lack of places to sit down and have a cup of tea or coffee.This time one of us stepped onto a pile of dung left by some enormous dog (hopefully not a man). Dear residents of Yroslavl', please clean up after your pets - their poo's stench is remarkable! Thanks God that day was rainy and there were many pools around. (But still - he reeked all hell for quite some time.)"
25,Pleasant place for a stroll,"I love that there is a way to walk along the river for quite a ways. It was quite chilly the weekend we visited, the wind coming off the river was cold. I imagine it is lovely in warmer times of year."
26,The best in Russia,"One of the reasons to visit the ancient Russian City of Yaroslavl, which has already passed its millennium, is certainly going to the Embankment of the Volga River. It is not also the location of the main city cathedral - Uspensky (the Assumption) and several major museums but also a long and wide pedestrian precinct where you can walk. cycle, rollerride or relax on one of the numerous benches enjoying the stunning views with a cone of your favourite delicious ice-cream. In winter you can also go coasting, skiing or skating in the nearby parks or enjoy a meal or a warm drink in a cafe which are plentiful in the area. You may as well watch some buskers there. All major city sights are also in the immediate vicinity, Newly-married come there for memorable photos of their weddings. In nice summer weather it is a good idea to walk as far as the river terminal and have a boat-ride on the Volga-river. Even if you visit just the embankment of this marvelous old city you would definitely yearn to come back again."
27,If you travel by boat – this is your starting point,An interesting place to walk on a Sunday afternoon to watch the families out for walks. This is a cruise boat stop and you can easily leave the boat and follow the embankment path past colorful historic buildings and into the parks. A further walk takes you into downtown. Wear good walking shoes though.
28,stunning in the winter,"The Volga river banking is a long area, perfect both for Summer and Winter walks. From here you can enjoy the beautiful panorama of the river and the other side of the city, also this path allows you to see several major sights of Yaroslavl: the Yaroslval Art Museum, the Musical Museum, the Yaroslavl History Museum and the Uspensky cathedral.The main bridge across Volga can be spotted here, as well as old architecture – various old houses and estates are located along the riverwalk. At several points you can have a rest at the pavilions or enjoy a meal at one of the restaurants and cafes.If you're having a river tour, then this is the place, where you'll start exploring the city. From here you can get fast to the city centre with its monasteries, old churches and other sights. At the very end of the riverwalk you'll find the musical fountains and the monument devoted to the 1000 years of Yaroslavl."
29,Beautiful Location,"take a slow walk in the evening, all the main museums are here. Couple of good restaurants too. You can even take a ride on a rental bycicle."
30,Good,This place is as scenic as any other in the world. The confluence of two awesome rivers makes for a picture prefect setting. During sep-oct the winds start to get a bot chilly towards the evening so dress accordingly.
31,Must see,Go during the summer- it is much more picturesque . Don't go too early as I was too early that the ferry station isn't open yet
32,Lovely,"Lage space, very well organised with fountains, flowers and greeneries. Very pleasant waterfront place to walk, sit on a bench and relax."
33,Great for a Long Walk,"The place to spend a nice evening with a bottle of wine, great company and a marvelous Volga view. Feel yourself like the Yaroslav Mudriy but a 1000 years in the future"
34,A beautiful walk,Great walk. Beautiful views. Lotsof things to see and to do. Historical place. Placed to eat.Just Fab!
35,Yaroslavl Embankment,"Volzhskaya and Korostel embarkments - both are well cared, have nice views to other side and must visit placed"
36,Beautiful view,"Start be walking through the city park at Krasny Plochade to the banks of the Volga.  Check ot the river cruises.  You will pass at least three museums before you reach the point where a smaller river joins the Volga.  Founding of Yaroslavl park reminded me of Pittsburgh.  Cathedral, monastery and downtown all are close to the end of your walk"
37,I great walking area.,"This is a somewhat difficult place to rate, as your experience will depend on the weather.  This is a wonderful walk along the Volga river when the weather cooperates.  The Embankment runs for a very long ways, probably further than most people would care to stroll.  Great views of the river on one side, and the museums and homes on the other side.  The embankment is very popular with the locals, and you will have a chance to experience a bit of Russian leisure life."
38,For a great walk,"The stroll along the Volga River is delightful on a warm day.  The park is well designed, and well maintained.  There are wide sidewalks, fountains, excellent views of the area and river.  It almost like strolling in Paris!  Enjoy the statues at the end, celebrating the 1010 founding of the city."
39,"Lovely view, nice promenade","Lovely strolling path in the shade of trees - it was actually sticky due to lime-trees, obviously in Russia it is blossoming in August and not in June like in my home town. leads to a modern and very nice Yaroslavl park, laid down for city anniversary (formed in 1010 - city, not the park)."
40,Just An embankment,"The embankment is a great place to stroll along the River Volga. There is much to see and enjoy along the walk.  There are parks, gardens, churches, and restaurants.  The scenery along the embankment is beautiful and you will want to take lots of pictures.  Plan on spending a few hours discovering the embankment in Taroslavl."
41,"One of the best area to relax, perhaps, even in the whole world.","A really nice embankment along the Volga and Kotorosl rivers.  Unlike in other Russian regional towns, this embankment is very clean and pleasant.  We were here in early October during the golden autumn.  It was a very pleasant walk with lots photo opportunities.  We visited several churches along the way and had lunch in one authenticly-styled Russian restaurant right on the embankment."
42,We docked here,"The viewpoint above the confluence of the Kotorosl and Volga rivers is well worth a visit for the views of the Volga and the riverside park.  Yaroslavl also has some other attractions, notably the St Elijah Church."
43,Picturesque stroll,This walk will impress at any weather. Dress appropriately warm. Take your camera. Vistas are divine.Stray off into streets and check details on older buildings.Breath-taking.
44,Picture perfect,"Breathtaking views over the mighty Volga, manifold cute onion domes peeking out here and there, local families strolling about, well-behaved cyclists, zero cars, it all feels very civilized, even on a Saturday night."
45,Just wonderful. A rare mix of amazing natural beauty with well-planned and well-restored architecture.,Nothing to write home about...Just an embankment where you can walk along with a gardens and a few restaurants...Overated
46,Picture-perfect walking park and vista,"Visit certainly. Beautiful views of the Volga, pleasant atmosphere for walks. Nearby are historic landmarks."
47,Picturesque location on the Volga,"Volga embankment is a very popular promenade among locals. This is where people come out to see and be seen. It stretches from the port all the way around the Strelka to Spassky monastery. There are easy access points to all things downtown – Red Square, Church of Ilya the Prophet, the new Cathedral of Assumption and old parkland with exclusive tennis clubs. Considered a part of the “restricted area” during Soviet days it now boasts many boutique cafes and museums."
48,Visiting a regional city in Russia,"It was freezing cold. We actually walked all the way along the embankment,cant really feel our toes but the view are stunning..it was snowing heavily so everything was covered with snow.."
49,Great view of the Volga river,"Yaroslavl Embankment is truly one of the best in Russian cities. It is beautiful, long and has great views on the merge of Korostel river and great Russian river Volga."
50,Very pleasant walk,This is really beautiful place especially in summer. There are two embankments (levels) -lower and upper. The problem is that there not too much cafes and bars nearby. But anyway I suppose that everyone we'll enjoy the views and atmosphere staying here.
51,A memorable walk on Volga's bank,"The Embankment running alongside the Volga river is a good spot for a stroll in the sun.  Good views over the river and the ships on it, as well as running along passed Museum and Churches too."
52,Stroll around the river and enjoy the cool air,"The Yaroslavl Embankment offers a variety of walks. From the town to the Cathedrals to the marina and beyond. You can walk on two levels the lower Embankment or the higher.There are lots of bars, cafes and restaurants all along. Very enjoyable area to visit."
53,Picturesque walk,"I like the quiet atmosphere of this area, you can see old building, museums, cafes along the embankment. Lower side of the embankment is a little bit boring to walk whole way, but upper side is nice."
54,Nice stroll on the water,Although it was chilly it was still a pleasure to walk along the river as it seemed so peaceful and calm. There are areas with flowers and small gardens. Some small kiosks selling souvenirs around the are. It’s a pretty long path too.
55,Nice Riverfront,Excellent walking promenade: river and beautiful nature. Appr. 2 km length from the bridge to the fountain.
56,wowsers,"Great place to go for a walk, take some photos or even go for a run or rollerblade. There are various churches you can visit and it's just a really nice place to be in Yaroslavl."
57,realx 3hs in a wonderful landscape and atmosphere,"Volga river being one of the most famous rivers in Russia has lots of towns and villages on its bank and in Yaroslavl it is a nice touch. In summer there is a lot of activity and socialising by the locals. The promenade is not too far from downtown and the main attractions of Yaroslavl the Red Square, Church of  the Prophet, and the  Cathedral of Assumption are all closeby."
58,Very relaxing...,"The embankment runs along Volga River and merges with Korostel River at the other end.  Nearly all the river cruise boats will embark/disembark alongside this part of the river which is convenient to tour around the nearby churches, museums and tourists spots.  There are two levels of the embankment and recommend you to stroll along the river on the upper level which offers better views on both sides."
59,nicу to walk there,"Well maintained place with several restaurants, walking area, very good for jogging. River port is also there, enabling to trip locally or to Moscow and further by Volga giver."
