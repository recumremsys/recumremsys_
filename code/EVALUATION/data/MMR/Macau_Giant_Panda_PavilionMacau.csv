0,great act,"A must go to place for all the panda lovers out there!!! The cute puffy creatures just make your day by their adorable and lazy acts. The panda pavilion is a well maintained place, where you can find normal pandas as well as red panda, along with few other animals. The souvenir shop too provides cute stuff related to pandas."
1,visit in November 2019,"The panda are ridiculously cute,you have a great view behind the glass of them eating,,they‚Äôre so much fun"
2,Amazing,"Escape the busy commercial casinos and visit this lovely park! You are guaranteed to see several pandas, some very up-close through glass. The grounds are beautiful and there's lots to see. Well worth spending an hour or so here when you have to get out of busy busy Macau."
3,Amazing experience for introduction to pandas ,"Not a big place but for the entry price & convenience to reach, no one should miss visiting these cute pandas.The red pandas here were also pretty fun to watch."
4,Mini zoo in Coloane,"The pandas are the most cute creatures ever. They are very well taken care, their pavillion offers everythig they need and it is very visible to the tourists.However, the place itself does not have even a single cab to ride back to the city (is quite far). And most impressive of all: itheir souvenir store does not sell a single stuffed panda for kids. Isn't that ridiculous?"
5,Horrible customer service,"A clean park with other animals, birds and plants too. The pandas are very adorable with cute actions. Spent some time admiring them."
6,Cool to see the pandas but the other animal enclosures are sad,This is most probably one of the most aftordable places to see 4 pandas -at one go  Kai Kai Xin Xin and their twin son Jian Jian Kang Kang. The Panda Pavilion is located within Seac Pai Van Park. The park is free entry but only need to pay 10MOP ($1.70) to enter the Panda Pavilion.  The park also has a small avian and primate displays.  The only thing I hope the Panda Pavillion will improve is the display of panda name.  A adult panda is in the enclosure but both adult panda names are on display.  How do I know which panda is it?
7,Nice outdoor place to spend a day,"A great place to spend time at, especially to who bringing kids along to visit the cute panda. Able to view the panda move around his/her cozy living places, and watch the activities on the spot.The panda pavilion is hosted within a big garden/park, which can spend time to visit as well."
8,Very affordable place to see panda,"Brilliant place to visit, the pandas are so cute! There are two adult and two youngster pandas, although when we went there was only one adult (I guess because they are usually solitary). The two youngsters, at nearly 3 years old, are so much fun to watch: lots of play fighting, tumbling, slapping and gently biting. It was really amazing to watch, you normally only see this sort of behaviour in documentaries on TV.The park also contains other animals, including two wonderful golden monkeys. The park is free to enter, and the panda pavilion only costs $10 each for over 12‚Äôs. Well worth a visit, in fact it was the highlight of our trip to Macau."
9,Upclose to giant panda,"Macau has a small public zoo with Pandas!! If you have every paid more(I know I have) to watch Pandas you should definitely visit this park. Entry is just 10 HKD and very less crowd, you can enjoy watching them for hours. There is a educational center as well that kids would love."
10,Neat little zoo,"There is only 2 giant pandas in the pavilion, however, there is nothing more special in the Park.  I would like to suggest go to Ocean Park which is located in Hong Kong as that is much more animals and fish to see."
11,Great zoo,"It's a nice & clean place to be, but you should be lucky to see a panda in action, there are other animals too but it's called the panda park"
12,Amazing pandas ,"Wow, for just 20MOP you get to spend quality time with the Panda and an area with lamars, chimp, parrots and other small animals. Very much a well maintained park and a great place for kids to run around in good weather. We were worried about catching a cab back to our hotel but there were 5 bus routes that ran through there so there was no problem. I definately recommend this place for a morning or afternoon away from the hussle of Macau casino hotels."
13,We saw a panda climb a tree!,"The Macau Giant Panda Pavilion's main attraction is seeing the Panda, its good for the kids to the panda in real. The trip to the place is really worth it. Its little known attraction outside of the main tourist areas of Macau City."
14,Great place to vist,I super love seeing real pandas ‚ù§üêº great macau experience and will surely have a great quick getaway with friends.
15,Good zoo in suburbs,These guys are the best part of Macau - the babies are so funny! We went at 4pm as recommended on here for feeding time & it was great. Must see! üêº
16, I hope the Panda is not sleeping.,"Do not hesitate. Go to the Panda Pavilion. The pandas are up close, cute and adorable! The best time to go is during feeding time at 2:00 (14:00). To see them chomping on the stalks of bamboo is a memory you will surely cherish for a long time.  Don‚Äôt miss it."
17,Nice well kept place,"I enjoyed every moment, pandas are wonderful, so clumsy and slateke, we saw a little panda, I think this place should not be missed."
18,Pandas ,"Almost a secret and not easy to find, but so cheap and such excellent enclosures for the 3 giant pandas; 2 juveniles in one enclosure and an adult in the other.  Closed on Mondays and from 1 to 2pm.  Absolutely loved our visit."
19,1pm,"It is a Good Experience to visit Macau Giant Panda Pavilion as my kids  enjoy watching the panda eats, the place is comfortable with indoor with aircond only on the Pandas)From Venetian to Giant Panda Pavilion location is not so easy to get Bus,Hence we took taxi. Taxi driver very rude not willing to tell more about the location.Overall the trip is nice (Taxi journey within 5-8 min time).Going back Venetian we took Bus (any Numbers Except #50) Bus was available quite fast & the bus stop need to take bus will bein the opposite way of Panda Bear Center."
20,Very cute and cuddly,"The Panda Pavillion is located at the Macau Zoo!  Yes, they have a zoo with a variety of animals but he Pandas Pavillion was  built especially for the two (2) Pandas which are on loan from China for the sum of $1 million (USD) dollars annually.  The pavilion cost in excess of $5 million (USD) to construct. China provided the technical and design for the pavilion."
21,Entertained by the Pandas,Oh how much I loved those Pandas .. Cutttiee Cutttieee ones.. It was an amazing experience and the Pandas were not shy at being lazy selves at all ..
22,Cool :),"The entire place is so very well taken care of, perfect place for kids and adults alike. The entrance fee is only MOP10 for adults, senior citizens can get in for free! There is also a butterfly park but it was closed for renovation when I was there. There are other animals there to see and beautiful landscaping all around the park. I'd love to walk and explore more of the park but because I'm with my parents I didn't. The panda enclosure is open for visitors on a 1 hour slot each. So it sometimes depends on luck if the pandas will choose to wanna come out for food/ to play. We were lucky that one of them came out and she was happily eating bamboo shoots for the entire 1 hour :) the next slot wouldn't be so lucky as she was asleep unless her partner or babies decide to come out? I'm not too sure of how it works but it's definitely worth a visit although this place is a little bit far out. Hailing a cab from the panda park is difficult, so be warned. Taking the public bus is the most convenient thing to do as the bus stop is right outside (on both sides of the road). We left and took the public bus to the ferry terminal and from there we take the free hotel shuttle to get to our next destination."
23,Great trip,macau giant panda pavillion is a great place. my kids really enjoyed seeing how the pandas were nurtered here. enjoyed a lot.
24,The Giant Panda and friends,"Clean, well planned, interesing zoo for those who got tired in casinos :)Tho pairs of pandas look healthy and happy eating bamboo"
25,Not to be missed !!!!,"great place to visit for family, free entry to the park and only 10 mop for the panda pavillion. surely a underated place , but a must if you have kids"
26,Panda,"Great little 'zoo' and we had a truly wonderful experience with two giant pandas eating no more than 3m away from us!! The zoo is free, with a 10mop entry fee for a one hour slot of the panda pavilion (more than enough time). Following tripadvisor advice (thank you!) we timed our slot for 4pm and it couldn't have been better - the pandas were eating for the full hour and we had an awesome view. Cheapest and best experience of our time in Macau. Extra tip: the bus stop is right outside: SO easy to get here - whole experience for less than 16mop per person!"
27,Have fun witnessing why pandas are vulnerable of extinction,The park is free to enter and 10MOP to see the panda pavilion. That is so cheap! However you may not see the panda - up to him if he comes into the part of the enclosure where the public can see. We only stayed a short time and saw a panda lying on a bench for about 20 minutes. It looks like there was quite a lot of work being done to make improvements and provide future enclosures.
28,Beautiful Park,"we just made it in time to view the giant pandas - they shut fm 1 - 2 pm! The pandas were v v cute. so were the red pandas. other animals average. i guess its really a place for kids. BEWARE - transport back, even to the close by cotai strip malls is very tough! so may be a good idea to book a return taxi"
29,Love the pandas!,"We really enjoyed seeing the Panda at the very well kept facitilies.. they had take away food, great gift shop and young children play park as well. it was very reasonable priced..we took the free bus to casino and then a taxi from there.. much cheaper way to get there."
30,So much potential ,"Living across the road from the panda park is a great getaway from apartment living or the bright lights if Cotai.The enclosure is air conditioned and has various animals, birds and kids playgrounds to see outside of the zone panda,Kai Kai.The downside is there is only 1 panda and he sleeps a lot!!! Panda aren't known for there active lifestyle- great photos when he is awake/ eating/ walking around."
31,Feeding Time,"Very surprised with the nice set up they have for the pandas, lots of space for children to enjoy as well."
32,Panda,"The pandas are the star of this attraction.We were lucky, came while they were eating. Shurong, the female panda, gave us attractive show while eating the bambos.From  Rua de Sao Paulo, we took bus no 26.It cost only MOP 6 per personDont forget to buy some cute souvenirs from the Pandas for your relative back home."
33,Up Close with Pandas,"Unfortunately all the giant pandas were asleep when I made it to the park, but for 10 MOP it's very inexpensive so it's worth taking the risk. Fortunately, the red panda was quite active so it wasn't all bad news. There are some other interesting animals within the park, such as lemurs and squirrel monkeys, so even if you luck out on the giant pandas, it won't be a complete loss!"
34,Fun and cheap opportunity to see pandas in Macau,The view of pandas steak your heart. A good place to visit for setting pandas. Make sure you don't miss the bus stop if arriving by a bus.
35,Overrated.,It's a steal for 10 MOP. The panda pavilion is lovely and the panda was very nice to watch as he ate and played. One panda has recently died which was sad and means there is only one giant panda at the moment.  This place could do with a spruce up which is happening. I didn't like the cages for the monkeys and birds. Not big enough.  If you do come to visit which I recommend make sure you know how to catch the bus back because it is impossible to call a taxi in Macau.  For the price it's very good and something different to do apart from gamble. The bus stop is right outside.
36,Dream come true,"We had good fun at the beginning seeing those panda palying around the cages but after one hour it becomes a be frustrating to look at them in such small cages, good to visit for a short while"
37,Panda Panda Pandas!!,"this park is quite extensive, and has lots to see - the giant pandas are housed in a great location, but were all asleep when I visited; the red pandas, however, were very busy running around in their enclosure."
38,Very nice,"I visited the Panda Park with my family. It is a great place to take the kids and see an assortment of animals and plants as well as the famous Pandas! After running around the park for a while, there is even a snack bar and a restaurant to enjoy. The kids also loved the playground."
39,We're so lucky to see the pandas!,"Got to agree with everyone about the state of the pavilion; you can tell that the pandas are well loved and great pride is taken in keeping them safe, happy, and healthy. The other animals, however, not so much. The cages for the birds are rather small and I am sure that they don't get to fly around as much as they would like.As the title suggests this isn't the easiest place to get away from. Getting there is no hassle, but getting back does require planning. Make sure you know which bus to get and from which side as it can be a time consuming mistake to get the wrong one. If you are planning on taking a taxi back; also think again. There is no taxi rank nearby and the road that pavilion is on is small and there is relatively little traffic so flagging down can be arduous.in a nutshell, you have to to see the pandas, but you have to have an exit in mind when you are finished seeing them."
40,PANDAS ARE CUTE,"Nice little park for the kids, was hoping to see a few more animals, panda show was short, apparently they like to sleep a lot."
41,Must visit!,"Set south of the main hotel ""Strip"" on Macau this park has a large pavilion where you can see Pandas in a large enclosure through thick clear glass. When we arrived a Panda was pacing backwards and forwards as if very unhappy at its confinement. But the real reason, it was hungry. It was 4 pm and time to eat. The Panda retreated to its room, the door closed. Another door opened and keepers can out with bundles of bamboo branches and placed down near the spectator window. They retreated and the Panda door was open and it ambled down to eat the bamboo. What a sight! The speed at which it devoured the bamboo leaves was awesome. The park is worth a visit anyway but especially if you can time it to see the Pandas feed. At this wasn't all. In a separate smaller pavilion there were a number of red pandas on show too. So... twice as much to see for your money."
42,"Cute as a button and very hungry - the park has more to offer, so plan to spend a few hours walking around",The 2 new pandas have moved in. They are cute. No need to wait in line. Best time going there is 3:30pm. They are active after the feeding time!!!
43,Can‚Äôt recommend this highly enough,"The name can be a bit misleading as they have other animals as well however, the Pandas are the main attraction. It was like a small zoo and all of the animals seemed to be in great care. The Pandas have lots of room to roam around in as well as some toys to keep them entertained! I went with a friend but there were families and couples there as well. There was also an exhibit with information about Panda's and an Aviary with Peacocks and other birds."
44,amazing pandas,"Visit at the right time of feeding 10 AM so I was able to see 3 of 4 pandas. The daddy, mommy and baby Jian Jian.Jian Jian was lazying, stretching maybe he has already finished eating. But mommy and daddy busy chewing. Clean, well maintain area.The place easily can be reach by bus from Cotai , entrance tickets MOP10 and sold at the souvenir shop.The place also has other animals, such as the energetic red panda , monkeys, etc."
45,Worth visiting!,"you have to go see the pandas.  good viewing area and the animals are well cared for. however, it is not a large exhibit/area.  you can get close by taking the bus."
46,Love the pandas!,Good place for Panda viewing - a ticket can be bought for 10 MOP and one can spend an hour with the pandas. There also an aviary and some other enclosures for birds etc but they were all vacant when we visited. But still it was worth a visit for us as our 5 yr old was thrilled watching pandas.
47,The pandas are sweet!,"I went just before lunch - the pandas were all asleep! But there's other animals to see - the Red Pandas are generally pretty playful and there is a big aviary with exotic birds and some monkeys. The grounds are delightfully quiet and peaceful, there is also a lake with some swans and flamingos - it's a great and quiet escape from the chaos of central Macau, and cheap as entry is free to the ground and it's only 10HKD to go into the Panda exhibit. You can walk here from the Cotai strip hotels. I just wish the Pandas felt like doing a bit more when I was there!"
48,Average place,"Totally exceeded our expectations. We only had time for either Hac Sa Beach or Giant Panda Pavilion and we are so glad we chose the pandas. The pandas we see elsewhere are always eating and eating. But here, we saw the panda climb a tree, fight with one another, do forward roll, take a dump, stand against a wall and make a turn. We witnessed so much within one hour. There are 4 pandas - Kai Kai and Xin Xin are the parents from Chengdu while the male twins Jian Jian and Kang Kang were born here. Tickets at MOP10 per person for 1-hour visit by the hour, closed from 1-2pm. There are both indoor and outdoor area."
49,"Giant pandas very cute, overall pleasant park specially for kids",What a fantastic place and only 10 mop entry a place not to be missed cannot wait to return with my family.
50,Good place for kids amidst casinos,"Very nice set up with over 5 pandas, both children and adult can visit and enjoy.  Be prepared to take photos and you can even buy souvenirs"
51,Lovely Pandas very active,"If you are a Panda lover then you must go here. Scratch that if you want smile at looking at something ridiculously cute go there. In Hong Kong you could spend HKD 150 to visit the Ocean park, or spend HKD 10 here and see the Pandas up close. If you are tired of the casinos (or have had a bad run) then come here to recharge your batteries. You will not regret it! Unfortunately they had only 1 Panda when I went. His sister apparently died only 2 weeks before I visited due to some illness. So he did look kinda lonely and sad."
52,Family vacation to Macau,Happen to see them having their meal. A nice opportunity. There are a total of 4 pandas in this pavilion. Two of them are the twin male offspring of the original 2 pandas given by China. Currently the parents are kept in separation as they fight each other for territory. While their offspring play with each other.
53,Pandas,Lovely gardens with an inexpensive Panda display in the middle! Only downside is that it's a bit out of town and taxis can be hard to come by!
54,small park but still worth visiting,Not your top of the range zoo and you will need to accept it for what it has to offer but the Panda Pavillon is well maintained and you get to really see the Panda.  Also not a very busy space so good for families (we had our three small children and two elderly grandparents with us and felt very relaxed for the two or three hours we hung out there).
55,Loved it,"This is a very very small park completely isolated from Macau it is nothing great ,if you really love pandas you can go and watch them but the park will finish in five minutes there are two rooms in which the panda are kept,pandas are usually sleeping when we also visited they were asleep.rest are animals like monkeys and lemur kept in a bery small room. Can take a pass"
56,Rare species,I guess the pandas were taking a nap somewhere as we didn't see any. The place is also kind of hard to reach and there's no public transportation. See pandas in Ocean Park instead...
57,Macau Pandas,"Sole purpose if the attraction is seeing the panda. The tickets are sold with seperate sessions thus for every session, bamboo will be placed out for the panda to come out to munch and after finishing the panda just went back to sleep/rest. After repeating so many sessions and and for so long, the panda kind of got bored and doesn't bother who's watching them. Living a routine life behind the glass seems cruel, especially now when only one left. The place is really middle of nowhere, so you either take taxi or learn to ride public bus, in my case we took the scenic route and went around the housing estates and neighbourhood on bus, but the good side is, it's close (on the way) to Lord Stow's restaurant, for those hunting for the famous tart, the originator."
58,So cool.,Clean and healthy environment for this beautiful beast.Pandas looks happy and well manteinedlove the birds and other animals that they have around
59,"If you've never seen Pandas, a must","We went here when it was still hot, hot hot! So nice to be in the air con pavilion. Anyway, the pandas, were great to see - there are also lots of other wild life around the park, birds and monkeys and lots to see. Very affordable. A taxi here costs us around $70 from the venetian. Then we got the public bus back to central where we could catch the ferry. Wow - it was a good place to get on the bus but as it travels through town it gets absolutely packed! Make sure you get a seat at the back - tricky to get off! I would eat before visiting the pandas - not great food! BE sure to check out the dates, they close for a little around 1pmish."
60,Quick glimpse of a panda,there were only two pandas during our visit! the other one is sleeping and the other one is falling asleep to. we wish to see more
61,Three pandas of Macau,"We went there after visiting Ocean Park Pandas, Pandas were not active at all in ocean park Hong Kong. We arrived at Macau Giant Panda by 2pm and this was a totally opposite experience. There were three Pandas in two enclosures and all three of them were very active, we enjoyed and watched the Pandas for whole hour and even after that it was difficult to leave that place. Pandas were very active and fun loving here. This place is very cheap just 10 Macau dollars for adult and free for kids. I highly recommend this place if you ant to watch the Panda. just take the taxi to get there. taxi is very cheap in Macau. You will enjoy this place."
62,A little underwhelming,"This is a must visit place , i had never seen Pandas and its not very crowded, ticket is not expensive and lots of Pandas seen, about six of them. They were really fun."
63,Super cheap but worth a lot more!,This cute park is a perfect place to see the Pandas.  We went during the week when it first opened.  It was not crowded at all.  When we first arrived only one panda was out.  Within 20 minutes 3 other Panda's were on display.  The display makes it easy to view the Panda's even when there are others around.  It was worth the taxi ride to go see it.
64,Best place to see pandas,"Went Macau for a day trip on 21/1/16, not planned but suddenly wanna see pandas!We arrived there around 2:30pm, not very busy. There are 2 parts of panda pavilion, indoor and outdoor. KaiKai was happily eating the bamboo in indoor part! We r lucky that he suddenly walked down near us so we can have a close up look at it! So adorable! Really don't want to leave the place!The last pic is a statue panda with the landmark temple in Macau, funny!"
65,Visit to panda Park ,"they are heartbreakingly delightful and its a must see for young and old , great mix of educational information and watching an endangered species made comfortable in a man made environment"
66,Best Panda viewing experience,For 10mop you get to seat and relax inside a airconditioned dome where you get to see pandas. Big place to go around the park. There is a kiosk to have snacks and drinks. Fare is flat 6mop. Bring exact amount as the bus drivee doesn't give change.
67,Small facility,"If you haven't seen properly any pandas in Ocean Park, then I strongly suggest you go to the giant panda pavilion in Macau! My fiance and I went to this place the day after we went to Ocean park. I learnt that there's a lot of panda in this sanctuary and you can spend time with them for an hour, though of course they're still be a glass barrier. It's recommended that you visit the place during feeding time of the pandas cos all of them are awake. Some say its nice to visit at 10 am to 11 am or 3 pm to 4 pm. They said once they finish eating, they will spend the whole day asleep. We went there at 10 am, the opening time of the park. And luckily, there were 3 pandas who were out to the public. Maybe its because there were children who were in their field trip during our visit,that's why there were 3 pandas. The 3 pandas were very cute playing around, that they even tumbled down to the near edge of the glass barrier. We saw them upclose! It was a really fun day and I hope everyone will be able to see them as well."
68,First Trip in Macau,"The pandas are lovely and the enclosure is quite spacious, clean and green! However, there are other animal enclosures that are small and the animals look a bit sad. If you are an animal lover you might want to skip that part. The park itself is lovely to walk in."
69,Love the Giant Panda‚Äôs in Macau,"If you have a dream to see a panda in your life, this is the best and most convenient place  I can suggest. Entry is very cheap and they have many pandas including few rare red pandas. They are kept in good environment, taken good care of and are healthy. Apart from this there are many other animals and birds here which equally cute. And if you have some time at hand, this place also has learning center inside where you can learn about lifecycle of a panda. It‚Äôs really informative and interesting."
70,Out of the way.,"Our goal here is to see pandas. But we came here when it's 10 minutes before the closing time for the 1st shift of the Panda Pavilion. To appease ourselves, we tour around the area except that of the pandas'. There are other animals here that people can see. The sea animals like ducks, geese and swans have a beautiful sanctuary. They are together in one area.It's very windy when we were here, so it's quite refreshing to tour around. We didn't need to pay for a fee to just roam and see the animals.There is also a playground here where children can hang out. When we were here, there are lots of children playing but people in the same age like ours are nowhere to be seen.The place is far from civilization though and we had a hard time looking for a place to eat because its surroundings are buildings and constructions."
71,Not a normal tourist attraction,"As Indonesian, I barely see Panda for live. Even it is a small park, you can see the Giant Panda directly alive and I think it's worthed. There are any others animal too like birds and monkeys (not really vary). If you want to go to this place you can arrange your plan trip with another spot like Parisian Hotel etc because it's inline way with the bus."
72,Worth a visit,"Actually this park is so awesome, especially at winter time. But have a little problems at the souvenir shop regulation. They not allowed to us to check inside the plastic bag. Because my family like to buy something / souvenir from every where we go. In here, we choose 4 black panda shirt. We can not open the shirt that we want to buy. I think in many Disneyland/sea that we already visit, they allowed to see inside ( open the plastic bag ) for the check only. Then very surprise when we open the shirt at home. 2 shirt is ok but 2 shirt ( in picture ) have some hole ........"
73,"Have to see ,","We visited the panda pavilion Macau in May 2018 with our children. It is wonderful and our kids enjoyed to the core. Why kids, even parents go mad and it will take us to our teen age. It has pair of panda bear with two cubs. Cubs are very playful. father panda did some majestic walk and tricks. You can see very rare animals and birds there. You may also like the souvenir shop. You may get panda printed t shirts at discounted rate. please do not miss out it is worth seeing. Bus is the best and cheap option for Macau. At the end, you will come out with a feeling to visit the place again. please download local mobile app for bus routes and timings and local sight seeing places. Enjoyed it."
74,A wonderful experience!,"I went to visit the Panda‚Äôs park with some friends and it was a surprise to discover a natural oasis in Macau.In the park there are a lot of other animals besides the main protagonist, you will have a lot of fun visiting this place.Admission is free for most of the park, you need to spend only few Mops to visit the Giant Panda pavilion but don't worry, even if you will find him sleeping it will still have been a good experience and a good investment."
75,Good views & Great Value,"The pandas are very cute, but only 2of it,and not many other animals too . Very small zoo.its very far from downtown , not sure it's a good idea to visit there ."
76,Well maintained,Memorable Yulin doing his antics kept us engaged. Very well maintained facility and a must visit when you are in macau
77,Poor panda,Nice little zoo which gives you the opportunity to get a very good view of the pandas. It is very cheap to get in at around ¬£1.00 entry fee. Well worth a visit if you are in Macau with a spare few hours.
78,Good to see pandas,"The stars of the park - the 2 pandas - are housed in a very small, unchallenged habitat. Other animals are in small cages. It is especially sad to see the ostriches sitting in a narrow cage, not able to stretch their legs.The best part is the visitor center where there are regular activities for young kids - but you'd better check online in advance."
79,Best Thing In Macau,Transport from the Panda Pavilion back to the hotels was a little sparse. But the Pavilion it's self is stunning and the bears are beautiful.
80,Get out of the casinos and go to this park!,"I have seen this twice as I live close by. Best time to see the pandas moving are around 10 or 2pm ( feed time). the pandas are very cute, but mostly sit and eat the bamboo. The park also has other animals and birds to see, including monkeys, lemurs, and ostrich. there is an educational area for the kids."
81,Lazy and cute pandas,"We visited the zoo at 12 noon only to find out they have a rest break for the indoor viewing at 1pm-2pm. We bought tickets for 2pm and waited at the upper floor of the panda center (airconditioned!) where they have a display and a video explaining the life cycle of the panda. It was great to get the 2pm viewing because it was the time when they were given bamboo to feed. After feeding, the father (which was separated from the twin males) climbed to one place and slept, while the other enclosure housing the 3 year old twins, they frolicked and played with each other as kids and this was quite a bonus for viewers. What will be the view for the next hour viewing, I do not know. But it will be boring just to enter the enclosure and just see sleeping pandas!"
82,Cuteness overload,"Its a good place to visit, seeing panda's and other exoctic animals in Macau. However some of the cages were empty, not sure why but definitely worth going."
83,Loved the pandas,"I live opposite the panda pavilion and finally went over to see with a group of my friends.its 10 MOP per person to see panda, as we came early we tried to roam around and see other beautiful animals around the area. Few animals though but we were entertained when I finally see 2 pandas for the first time. It's fun to take kids and families here cuz it's peaceful and quiet! Beautiful flowers and trees that you can see if you love the nature."
84,Great place to watch pandas,"This place is a must do in Macau.  The grounds are really well kept, and you can see the panda's are well cared for.  we even came back a second time to try and see the junior pandas.Like previous reviewers have said the park should charge more money for the upkeep of these beautiful animals."
85,I can watch Pandas eating all day,"If you are in Macao with small children, this is the place to go. You can take any bus going to Coloan island and the bus stop is just next to the main entrance. The ZOO is small and mostly quiet. You can see two fett pandas in kind of 5* pavilion and couple of other mammals and birds in small cages. There is a library where you can stay for another half an hour to learn something more about pandas."
86,Cutttieee Pandas,"I think there were four pandas which is more than you usually see in one place.  They seemed happy and were surprisingly active, eating bamboo, walking around, even wrestling with each other.  The park itself is nice and was not crowded at all.  Several other animals were on display as well including monkeys, ostriches, a fat bunny, etc.  Not close to the city but cab ride was relatively inexpensive.  You might want to arrange for a pickup since it's not a great place to catch a taxi."
87,Well Worth a Visit,"When I visited, the pandas were walking around, eating, climbing, and being very active. They have a large space to move around in. There are multiple exhibits, each with only one panda. The downside is that one of the exhibits appeared to be empty at the time of my visit. The admission is very cheap as well, being only MOP/HKD 10!"
88,So much fun!,Needs a variety of wildlife. Is interesting to see the 2 pandas. They were up and about and we saw them having their lunch there after started playing
89,Excellent!,"I think the panda park will be very big, but actually it is extremely small! I was quite disappointed as we went to the panda park, the panda was sleeping, and there is nothing else to see."
90,Must visit for young and old. ,This destination is within 2-3 bus stops from casinos but is worth to visit and much cheaper than most sight in Macau. Pavilion has a huge territory of park to walk for children beside panda and rare Asian animals such as master Shifu prototype.
91,visit the pandas,Am so glad we were able to visit the Giant Panda Pavilion.  We go there at about 10:30 which was perfect as the teen Pandas were out and eating and were picture perfect.  Mama Panda was also out and about and Papa Panda was napping but very visible.  Loved that they shared their story and background.  And they also had the Red Pandas which not clear why they're called that as they look more like racoons but they were so adorable.  They also had different primates and birds.  If we had more time I would've loved to spend more time there but it's a definitely destination to visit if you're a panda lover like we are!
92,Pandas...what else do you need?,"If you love pandas, then the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is the place to visit when you are in Macau. As the other reviews state, the absolute best time to go is at 4pm. This is the time they feed the pandas, so they are awake and you can get awesome pics of them. I recommend that you arrive here at 330pm to make sure that you have enough time to see the panda while they are awake. By 415pm the panda was done eating and was no longer in view to take good pictures. The price is very cheap, only $1.25 USD per person. This is the cheapest place in the world to see pandas. The mother panda was the only one that was out eating. The best way to get to this location is by taxi. If you are by the St. Paul Ruins, the cost will be about $15 USD and will take about 30 minutes to get there. There is other animals to see like cute red pandas and lots of monkeys and birds."
93,Quiet place,"Saw two baby pandas and one adult panda.  The baby pandas are behind glass, but the adult panda can be photographed without anything between you and the panda. Really cool experience."
94,Must visit for Panda fan,"First time to see the Giant Panda (there are two in Macau), we went there at about 4pm and they just decided get up and munch on their bamboo, it was very cute. The Pavillion was pretty empty so that was nice. There was also other small animals outside of the Pavillion as it is a big park. The place was a bit hard to get too however, the bus and taxi might be better for you as there is not a hardly any car parking spaces. You don't have to pay to get into the park but you do have to pay around MOP10 to go see the pandas."
95,Absolutely loved it with these active Pandas,"Staff very rude and un helpful, Panda pavilion has only 1 lonely panda which sleeps most of the time behind a rock, Other animals poorly kept in cages smelling strongly of urine."
96,Pretty,"They need your support, you need about an hour for this visit, at least they are not in small cages, and when we there they had a lot of fun. Kids will love it!"
97,Nice place in Macau ,"travel away from the casinos so that your kids also feel part of the vacation. could well spend over 2 hours, activities available for kids to be engaged"
98,Ticking my wife‚Äôs ‚Äòbucket list‚Äô,"You only need to pay 10 MOP if you want to see the pandas. You need to buy your ticket for a particular time frame (you can go anytime in that hour). There are two pandas, chances are they will be sitting and eating. Kids under 12? are free, seniors over 65 are free."
99,Pandas!,"When in Macau with the family, take them to the Giant Pandas. Go early (10a) as they tend to sleep in the afternoon. Super cute and very cheap."
100,Pandas!! and that's about it,"The park is located in Coloane island. It is a good getaway from the noisy and crowded casino. There is also a museum and some other animals in the park. The panda pavilion requires $10 mop to get in. There is also a hiking trail to the top of the hill which is a A-Ma Cultural Village. Originally there were 2 pandas, named ""Kai Kai and Xin Xin"" which means ""happiness"". Unfortunately, Xin Xin died in June 2013. The park still hasn't received another female panda from China. So the lonely Kai Kai is inside a full air-conditioning room all by himself. He desperately needs some love. The best time to visit is 3:30pm - 4:30pm, it is the feeding time. So you can see him very active, juggling, eating bamboo and climbing up and down. Good Luck! ^^"
101,Short trip to visit Pandas,I gave reviewed this before as live closeby. Kai Kai the previous resident panda has left the building and 2 new pandas are now in residence. Feeding times is from 3-4pm is the best chance to see them playing and walking around- remember they sleep a lot.There is also a bird aviary that you can walk in and see the birds. Also kids area to make toy pandas. The panda enclosure is fully air conditioned- great for the macau summer.
102,Truly enjoyable for animal/panda lovers ,"nothing special about this place,its far from town and there is only one panda there. there are some monkeys and black ducks which is interesting.you can not call this place zoo."
103,The Panda experience!,They are cute. I blogged about them. Google dranshublog and giant panda to read all about my visit and see a cute video too
104,What a great place,"It is heartwarming and happy to see the pandas. I went to Macau Giant Panda Pavilion almost three times. Each time I see Kai Kai, Xin Xin. They are sleep. Haha! They are so lazy. The two giant pandas Kai Kai and Xin Xin are cute. The name of Kai Kai ,Xin Xin is chosen by the people of Macau. If you go to Seac Pai Van Park to play then you must go to Panda Museum. But it is very far from downtown.The museum is next to the park. You just pay $10 MOP to see the two giant pandas. If you are Children (12 & under) and seniors (65 & above) is free. But we can only see the panda separated by the window. Almost with the Ocean Park in Hong Kong, there are many souvenir. If tourists want to buy souvenirs, the outside of Macau Giant Panda Pavilion gift shop, the souvenirs are high availability, such as handbags and clothing. The Park is a good place for child and parent, it is nice for parents and children playing for a whole day. Child must like the two pandas very much. If you like this animal, you must visit Macau Giant Panda Pavilion!"
105,Lovely Pandas,"This is a small zoo with a small charge of about $6 AUD to see the pandas, otherwise it is free entry to see the other animals. We were enthralled to watch three pandas munching lots of bamboo, walking, rolling around and lazing on rocks in their enclosure. So cute!"
106,This is the place to see Pandas.,Good place to spent 1-2 hours to view the 4 pandas and other animals. Ticket is cheap though distance is quite far from Macau city.
107,"They were doing construction work, so it was a bit noisy.",The panda is must see. It was a quick stop for us to visit the Panda and other animals. We spent like one hour there. Just enjoyed the brisk walk. From here you can take a bus to Coloane Village for another quick stop.
108,A wonderful visit with the Pandas!,"Some friends and I ventured outside of our resort style hotel to act like a local and to see the sites of the city. We hopped in a taxi and pointed to the pandas on a map. The price for the taxi ride from the Okura was not bad; ask your concierge for more information. BUT there's a catch. The taxi doesn't drop you off at the pandas. The taxi takes you halfway up the hill to A-Ma Temple, drives in 3 circles in the parking lot, THEN lets you out. Did I mention that if he let you out at the bottom of the hill there is a shuttle to take you up the hill? I digress... Pandas. After coming down the hill the pandas are to your right, down the street. The admission price is reasonable. You are able to visit the panda pavilion with one panda, the aviary with two emu, and the education center. There are parks and statues all over which were great to see. We visited mid morning and got to see the panda doing what he does best: sleeping. Wondering why I gave it 4 stars seeing as most countries have more pandas in their zoos and emu on their ranches? I loved seeing the kids visiting. They were the best behaved kids, all standing in a row, marveling at one giant sleeping teddy bear. They were intrigued by the panda facts at the education center. They walked in a perfect little row. The were told to smile for a picture and all at once there were 24 perfect smiles - and 48 peace signs on their fingers. You see, the panda was good. The kids were fantastic. I came to see local life and that's exactly what I got.The pavilion is across the street from a bus stop. If you want to go north again towards Taipa, you'll need to cross the street and wait at that bus stop. Plant to have accurate change for the bus fare. Ask the gift shop attendant for more info. Expect to spend between 30 minutes to 2+ hours here."
109,"Happy, Lazy Pandas","We were visiting Macau for the Casinos but saw this on trip adviser and as big animal lovers though we would make the trip. And we loved it! It's not very big but when we got there we saw both mum and twin pandas having a play then dad next door.  They were all active for about 25 mins before a wee snooze. The wee gift shop was very reasonable and had some lovely panda gifts. To get here we got the free shuttle from the outer harbour ferry to the Venetian, then a taxi from there to the pandas ($40 hk dollars and taxi took hk dollars no problem) then coming back the lovely security guard from the panda shop was extremely helpful in telling us how to catch a local 25,26a,21a bus, just along the road back to the Venetian which was $5 per person. Every one at the park was very friendly and helpful and although we only spent a few hours there it was well worth the trip to see them so would recommend it to anyone who loves pandas."
110,Panda bears,"It was nice to have an opportunity to see and film a Panda.  The zoo is very small with a few animals.  Some are confined in a small area (Ostrich) with no room to run or roam.  The Panda facility is larger but there are still paths where the Panda's seems to pace.  Nice to see, but couldn't help feeling the animals all needed more room."
111,Quiet,"I lived in China for several years and have seen pandas in 4 countries, but the set up here is about the best I've experienced.  A ticket (MOP10, ridiculously cheap!) allows access to the giant pandas' pavilion for an hour.  Each session begins on the hour.  The enclosures (2) are huge and the care for the pandas is obvious.  Pandas are just a joy to watch.  The pavilion has both adults and young-ish pandas (two 2-year-olds).The red pandas (3 or 4? absolutely adorable and often more active than giant pandas) are housed in a separate, smaller building.  They, along with several monkeys, lemurs, and a few birds (plus a good-sized flamingo colony), are free to visit (only visits to the panda cost). There's a panda information centre which is free, informative, and interesting.  And the gift shop has many panda-themed products at very reasonable prices.  Most are kitschy, but that can have its own appeal. The park is quite compact, but there are also some shaded benches to get out of the worst of the heat.For those staying in Cotai, nothing could be easier than getting to Seac Pai Van Park. At least 4 local buses (21, 22?, 25, 26) go there for a flat cost of MOP6.  From right in front of City of Dreams, the ride was only about 15 min."
112,Best part of Macau! ,"Everyone should know panda is national animal protection. Panda is very precious so we must cherish and love more the animals. Firstly, Macao has less zoo, China give two pandas in Macau, therefore, we must treasure the panda well. So the government was building the place for panda to living. And put this joy thing to every people to watch, I was go there one time with family in our free time, before visit the panda pavilion, I had gone the mainland china such as some zoo to watch many variety animals and one of the panda. I think that the pandas were so cute and relaxing. They do not need to do everything; the breeder will give them some bamboo on time. I think that place suitable for family number to visit, but because of the remote location, and there is no shuttle bus, do not benefit for tourists visiting; In addition, the animal park is too small, relative to the number of animals in Hong Kong and the mainland zoo is really less and have less but park environment quite beautiful. Remember last time when I visited pandas, obviously have two pandas, but I only see one and the one just only sleep and eat."
113,must visit place in macao,"We've been to see pandas in Berlin, Taipei & Tokyo but here in Macau we had the best panda viewing experience. It was pretty empty since the Panda pavilion is out of the way from all other tourist attractions in Macau. If you stay in the Cotai casino strip then head South with a local bus which costs less than ¬£1 per trip. It takes only 10 miuntes to get there. And entrance to see the pandas is similarly cheap. It's not a ""zoo"" as the only real attraction are really the 4 pandas. There are a couple of Red pandas, too, and a few Lemurs and Monkeys, but that's it. The pandas are cute and have some pretty large enclosures to live in. And as I said, it was pretty ""unhurried"", like in Tokyo the wardens pushed us along because there were too many visitors. We stayed maybe 30 mins to look what the pandas were doing and in that time there were maybe a dozen fellow visitors, not more! Definitely worth a trip!"
114,Wow - Loved it,"This is a giant panda pavilion which is inside a public tracking park. In the park, there's also a research center of panda, but overall, it's not a zoo with lots of other animals. If you're expecting that, it might just disappoint you. The park is located in the south of Taipa, where is easy to get access by local bus. Entering the park is free, but you will need MOP10 for adult at 13~64 yrs. Children under 12 and senior visitors over 65 is free for entree. The pavilion is regularly off on Mondays, and break on 13:00~14:00. 6 visiting schedules per day, each visit is up to 1 hour. It's a great place to pay a visit, even though just watching panda eating, and you may be able to watch that for 30 min. That's how adorable they are. One thing you need to be aware. The staffs are restrictly following a order: Be quiet. They might just ""shh"" you if you talk a bit louder. Don't be surprise and feel insulted, they just do their best to keep pandas under great place of living and not to be scared by people. BTW, the viewing stage is basically connecting to panda's land."
115,Giant Pandas galore!,The Park is overall a nice place.  We only saw one panda when we visited but still it's worth to see one because of the cuteness of such creature.  The pavilion is informative and there are cheap finds in their souvenir shop.
116,Great to see Pandas,"The giant panda pavilion has got 2 pandas in separate enclosures. The room is cool inside and they have time slots for entering. However if you reach late you can wait for the next slot and till then your child can play on the slides and swings outside and see the other few animals.It is a cute attraction which kids enjoy and if you are lucky you can see the panda uprooting the grass and eating and the other one sleeping!However to get back it is difficult to get a cab, so u need to walk to the nearest bus stop and please ask your hotel concierge which bus number to take to reach back to the hotel."
117,A must whilst in Macau!,"Great way to spend a morning. The pandas are wonderful, there's a little quiet walking path around the hill, and a few other animals to check out. Thoroughly enjoyed spending a few hours there."
118,New experience ,"We were luck to see the pandas awake and active and their enclosure seems well maintained and suitably sized. Can't say the same for the half dozen other animals (gibbon, deer, monkeys) which were housed in tiny spaces. Really not good enough"
119,Great Panda House,"In little-visted Coloane, this is a little park with some zoo features and the panda pavilion. You have to pay to see the panda, but they're cool so it's worth it. Mostly they sit on their butts and eat bambo, but it's a panda... that's what they do."
120,Problems with the merchandise ,"If you like to see giant panda. There are two in Macau which their behaviors are the same like others such as in Chiang Mai, Thailand. They spend most of their time for sleeping. By the way, they are very cute animal."
121,Great location and a nice family outing,"It's pretty close to hotels area. Animals are clean and happy. Exept 4 pandas, there is 2 red panda, monkeys, lemurs( huge ), parrots, swans, flamingo etc . They are closing by 5 so better come before 4 to see all animals, Visit panda ticket around 20 MOP. Very cheap. Tips:in case you won't be able to catch a cab on the way back, you may use public bus on the opposite side of road, about 5 stops to Studio Hotel, 5 MOP per person."
122,Panda Pavillion,"A beautiful park with very cheap entry - around $2AU pp. Only 3 pandas were there, but they were so cute! The rest of the park had flamingos, red pandas, and so many other animals. A definite must for anyone going to Macau. TIP: get a taxi there. Don't try and walk it! We tried to walk back to the Venetian from here (a mere 3km away), and it is not pedestrian-friendly."
123,Nice place with good environment,Yes it is small but for only $1-$3 US you would be crazy not to miss this opportunity for a close encounter with Giant Pandas ... small groups are allowed in at intervals so it doesn‚Äôt become too crowded and there are other animals to see outside ... again it is free to enter and small but worth the trip truely !!!! ... here‚Äôs a suggestion book the 10am visit you will be guaranteed a close encounter every time !!
124,A nice and intimate zoo - a very pleasant outing for the family,Normally pandas are not easily available to see .. on that point it is good .. but rest of other angles.. it is not that much.. nice .. poor maintenance spoils its worth .. Indian rupees nearly 160/- is too high for this attraction.. for Indians inevitable.. (for pandas).. rest of others .. less value spot...
125,Good Family Visit,"We made the trip out to this place and it was absolutely worth it! It is only open tuesday to sunday (ie it is not open mondays - unless the monday is a bank holiday in which case it is also not open the tuesday - essentially make sure it is going to be open before you go!) and is open between 9.30 and 5.  You can take bus 50 from the ferry terminal (apparently) but it is much easier to get a taxi and was not expensive - we did get a bus back though as far as the Venician casino.  They feed the pandas about 10am so hightly recommend getting there about 10 as the pandas are awake and feeding at this time. It is a non touristy, well maintained, large place that seems to be genuinely trying to do the right thing by the pandas"
126,Beautiful animals,"Nice place to visit if you've never seen a panda, but very hard to get to as there are no shuttles only buses."
127,Pandas,"The Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is a seemingly little known attraction outside of the main tourist areas of the Cotai Strip and Macau city, although it is only  a very short taxi ride from Cotai.While there isn't a great deal to see and do at the Pavillion, it does offer the unique attraction of being able to get very close to and observe a Giant Panda without a throng of screaming tourists bustling by and getting in the way. For just ten dollars (MOP/HKD) the visitor gains entry to the Pavilion for a one hour viewing slot, allowing uninterrupted and very up-close viewing of the panda, all in glorious air con. There was only about ten other people in the pavilion with us when we visited and in comparison to comparable panda attractions such as Ocean Park Hong Kong, was a far better experience at an absurdly low cost. As well as the Panda Pavilion there is a park and a few other animals including ostriches and other birds and some very lively monkeys and apes. These are all free of charge to view. I would advise avoiding the walk through aviary unless you want to get bitten to death by mosquitoes.  Sadly, one of the pandas that used to be housed in Macau recently dies but the other (ÈñãÈñã) is still alive and well. Highly recommended, the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion allows unrivalled views of these fascinating animals."
128,Cute cute cute,My 10 year old insists on seeing the pandas. It did not cost us much but wasted a lot of time getting there by bus and getting lost on the way back. The Pandas has all grown up so nothing cute about it.  There is a centre which shows how the twins were born and grow. That was interesting. They were so cute than.  We arrived during  feeding time  so they were active.  Eating  and a little playing and sleeping right after. We had an hour slot. It is will aircon so it was fine inside the confined area.
129,Absolute Must See,"Loved it!!! The grounds are beautiful.  It is a great place to go and relax.  It has beautiful gardens, some monkeys and flamingos.  The panda exhibit was really nice.  You are able to view the pandas in a natural habitat.  I could of stayed all day and just watched the panda.  Only one was in the viewing area when we visited."
130,Cute pandas,"I came at Macau Giant Panda on December 2017 with familyThis place not big but very nice place for kidsThey have many pandas inside the park and we can see lively panda's activities, and have others animal inside the park like birds, monkey, fish etcEntrance park free for child under 11years old and senior citizen, and have souvenir shop, cafe inside the park"
131,Fantastic - hidden gem,Very good value for money at mop 10.Pandas in nice spacious enclosure and seemed relaxed and well cared for.Other animals to see such as monkeys and birds.Nice gardens to wander around.Cafe to get a drink etc.Lovely way to spend a few hours.Well worth a visit
132,Must visit,"The panda pavilion is part of a larger area with several activities and attractions. Besides pandas there are monkeys and other small and medium sized exotic animals. The general area is free of charge, for the pandas an entry fee is charged. visiting this mini zoo is a nice thing to do for families and kids. It is easy to get there, many public buses stop right in front. Also a good stopever when heading to visit Coloane village."
133,Great Pandas!,"OK, we went here to see the pandas and it was interesting to see them feeding but they did not come to close to the front of their enclosure so we had to view them from 20 m away. Two share one enclosure and the other one has an enclosure to itself. There are several more animals and birds kept in the park (which is free to visit), but there is a small fee to enter the Panda pavilion. There are many panda sculptures and a souvenir shop. The place is very popular for children on school trips. An hour would be enough time to spend here."
134,"PANDA, PANDA, PANDA, PANDA!!!!!!!","Be sure to visit at feeding time - 11 AM or 2 PM I believe - and you can see the pandas when they are active. If you're in this part of Macau definitely make a stop here and to the nearby Matsu Cultural Village, a 5 minute walk from the panda park."
135,Cuties,"Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is an inexpensive stop on the way to/from Coloane Village to get a close look at the adorable panda bears.  There are other areas (that do not even charge admission) that have red pandas and various monkeys.  However, the suffocating enclosures they are in is a bit depressing to see."
136,Twin babies !,"I have visited here for seeing the two giant pandas with my father. The pandas were eating bamboo when I visited. The amount of visited people was not that much so I was enjoyed to seeing the pandas quietly. In fact, I didn‚Äôt know how to distinguish this two pandas clearly even thought I have asked my father who knew their key differences. However, I like this place because the environment was fantastic for the pandas to live and was provided a good platform for people to appreciate. And I felt delighted when the cute pandas were playing the yellow ball happily. It made me wanted to be a panda which live such a wonderful circumstance. So I viewed you should go to visit this two pandas. Perhaps, they may fall asleep when you arrive, but you can pay attention to know their living environment while you are waiting for them to wake up."
137,Loved this ,The entrance fee was very low. The pandas were so cute that  I just couldn't stop watching. It was a Saturday and only a few visitors were there. Much less crowded when compared to the Ocean Park in Hong Kong. Could see the pandas more leisurely.
138,Panda heaven so cute! ,"We were very lucky arriving at 1415 and heading straight into enclosure to see them both eating, rolling, scratching then they went to sleep. So very cute. I can imagine disappointment if they slept whole time though. If you are a person who likes walking you can explore up the mountain behind the enclosure for free."
139,Great place to see Panda's,"For whatever reason my wife desperately wanted to see the Giant Pandas, whilst on Macau. So off we went. And I must admit that they were pretty cool - very active and entertaining on the day. We all had a great view of them frolicking - which pleased everyone. If you can handle all of the ‚Äòpanda merchandise‚Äô then it is worth a visit. We went by bus and managed it ok."
140,Be patient,"The park has nothing special, no other facilities to support like a restaurant or snacks bar. Summer is extremely hot and lots of mosquitoes. Maybe worth it to see if you ever seen a panda before."
141,Just Pandas!!,"Well, I almost wasn't. The panda lives in a large pavilion and hides from the crowds when it likes to so you chances to see it up close is probably lower than in most zoos."
142,So cute,"We really enjoyed our visit here. Not too many people so that is a plus! The gift shop is good too not very expensive. There are some other  animals to see at the park as well, the pandas are the highlight! We only saw one the male I guess the female stays in the back with the babies until they get older. We still had a great time being able to see the male up close, well behind the glass, still it was a great experience! We took a cab there and the bus back, the bus is very easy and much cheaper. Well worth a visit!"
143,Nice panda pavilion but not a zoo,"We headed here for the 3pm showing for the pandas.  One panda slept the whole time, the other panda was up and moving around, however looked more like he was pacing and was stressed.  The park needs some improvements, some of the enclosures didn't seem big enough for the animals housed there (ie the ostriches & the lonely deer).  To get here, we used taxis from the Cotai strip (was about $7 AUS each way). The park has a very heap entrance fee and the pandas are gorgeous."
144,Like a run down zoo,"There is not much beside panda, watching them being feed it is very interesting to see how they behave while eating bamboo leaves"
145,Good place to see Pandas,"At the time of my visit there were three pandas visible. I got a ticket for an hourly slot ten minute after I arrived and entered with maybe 6 other people. I‚Äôve been to a few places that have pandas on display, and to put this in perspective, Uneo Zoo in Tokyo has a 50 minute queue for the panda enclosure 5 minutes after it opens. I visited Macau on a warm Sunday at around 11:30 so I don‚Äôt think it was an anomaly that it was so empty.The enclosure is spacious and well designed to give plenty of viewing angles conducive to a nice photo. The pandas seemed content.I thought I had misunderstood the pricing, but it actually does cost about ¬£1 to view the pandas. I‚Äôd have happily paid twenty times as much for such a rare experience.This place is a bit of a pain to get to, perhaps that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not very busy. The nearest stop on the open top your bus is a 30 minute walk away (I know because that‚Äôs how I did it) and it‚Äôs not a particularly nice walk either, down a featureless highway. I think you can get a public bus, but it very much feels like it‚Äôs outside the main tourist track and into the suburbs.The park that contains the pavilion is fairly small but quite nice. I think it has a few other things there but I was on a schedule and left straight after seeing the pandas.In summary, if you have any interest in seeing pandas specifically, this is a great place to do it, but be clear that you‚Äôre making a trip out of the city to to just that.Tickets are sold for an hourly window that starts on the hour, so the ideal time to arrive is probably 45 or 50 minutes past the hour to avoid waiting around too long, though in practice I don‚Äôt think anyone actually looked at my ticket after I bought it, perhaps because it wasn‚Äôt busy."
146,Panda bears galore,"This small zoo is a great opportunity to see pandas, close up.  It is easily found and there is a local bus stop nearby.  The entrance fee was MOP10 - a bargain (!) for plenty of time to watch the pandas. The tickets were time stamped, but I did not see that enforced.  However, there were only a few people in the panda enclosure.The day that we went we watched the young pandas play for about 45 minutes before their lunchtime and then watched an adult panda eat lunch!The zoo also has red pandas, not seen the day that we were there and other tropical animals.  Clean and spacious.  Highly recommended."
147,"Pandas cute, not much to do here","I have been to Singapore, Hong Kong and just recently Macau to view Panda. If you just want to view the Panda alone, Macau's Panda Pavilion is the most value for money and the least crowded, even for he weekends,allowing you really relax and clear view of the Panda. I was told that during Chinese New Year we might have a chance to view all 4 pandas - mommy daddy and two babies! For now it was just daddy that we are able to see ! Nevertheless daddy was really good , he ate and played in front of us. The entrance ticket is only MOP 10 and free for people over 65 - you can't ask for more! There are other animals like monkeys and the flamingo as well as the ostriches that are there . There is a visitor centre which I didn't have time to visit - they seem to offer some arts and craft classes for children. In front of the pavilion are little statues of pandas decorated in different colours and designs an attraction themselves! I feel however there is more that can be done for this place , giving people more reason to visit !"
148,Great experience ,It is hard to see Pandas outside of China and this is a rare opportunity. It is only $10 entry and there are 4 pandas and a lot of other rare animals to see. Even in Hong Kong you have to pay over $300 to see them in Ocean park and this is as good if not better. Well worth doing next time you are in Macau.
149,Good place for Kids,"Tickets have a time on it but when we went there was only 2 other visitors so no problem at all for us to enter. There are 2 pandas to see, that's it. The first onle was moving a lot as it was time for him to eat so we could take nice photos. The other one, outside, was sleeping under a tree, far from us, so no chance to take photos. Well, for the price paid, we can not complain. We took the opportunity to walk to Coloane and visit this small village.To get to the Giant Panda Pavilion, we took a bus from Studio City as it was less expensive than from the city centre of Maau. You need the exact money to pay the bus (3,20 MOP with the bus 26) - no free shuttle bus to go there."
150,Macau Giant Panda,"This place is great. before the entry to see the panda, there are some other animals like the monkeys and parrots. The most interesting of course is the panda. We went at the time when the pandas are having their meals. The one year old baby pandas are the cutest. We watch them played with each other. The pandas seem to be well taken care of by the park.The gift shop is very small and simple. Nothing much to offer."
151,Good visit,"I love pandas, so so cute. Pavilion, itself could be bigger. The red panda had really small cage! Park is pretty run down too. But animals are sweet."
152,Excellent :),"This is a neat little zoo that you can access with taxi or bus from the major hotels in southern Macau. Entrance cost is 10 pataca and gives you access to view the pandas for an hour. There are also some other animals (monkeys, birds) to watch at the location. From this spot you can also access the nearby hiking trail, which was a nice suprise. When I visited, the pandas were fairly active and ate bamboo."
153,Overall worth the visit for those with Kids.,"Decided to make a trip to see Pandas as read a lot about it and my 7 year old was very keen.  This place is in the middle of a residential area so it is difficult to get there and back.  Here's hope we did it.  There was seven adults and one child.  We took the free bus to City of Dreams from the Macau Ferry Terminal.  Then we walked to the South Entrance of the mall (where the free bus drops you off, enter the mall and turn left.  Keep walking past all the cosmetics counters).  Head outside the entrance and turn right.  You should see a bus stop by the side of the road. Take 26A (or 21A) and it should stop you right outside the enclosure. Estr de Seac Pai Van is the road outside.  After the panda session, we took the same 26A from opposite the road and that took us all the way to St Paul's.  Each trip cost $6mop or hkd, they don't give change on buses so make sure you have sufficient coins.The enclosure was great.  Not many people and the pandas were right up close. We were there at 2pmand they were feeding and active so it was awesome.  Now if you are a massive animal lover and think animals should be out in the wild or have a lot of room, this might not be the place for you.   The enclosure is split into two for three pandas and each half is probably about 25m x 40m."
154,"Pandas, visible, in a landscape, no trekking involved","This place is easily accessed by public bus from either the large casino hotels or from the old Town (the bus stops just outside). It costs only 10MOP to see the pandas, which is extraordinarily good value. We timed our visit to coincide with afternoon feeding at about 4pm, and got good views of the pandas up and about eating. There are also other animals such as red pandas, monkeys, and a few other things, all of which can be seen free of charge. Definitely worth a"
155,Pandas always sleeping ,"It's free of charge to see animals as birds, parrots, gibbons, monkeys, flamingoes... and to see the pandas are just 10 MOP. There is a few information - like name, origin country, specie near each one. The panda pavillion is in a well maintained space with AC.In the park we can find a pavillion with a few activities for kids as well. The garden is beautiful and well maintained. It has a small coffee shop and a souvenirs store. Just missing more shadow."
156,Get Up Close to Giant and Red Pandas,Only a couple of pandas. All other exhibits look run down and not cared for. The also close the Panda exhibit for an hour and have high security around it not sure why.
157,Pandas!!!!,We're lucky to visit it right after it closed for some time. There's only one panda right now -- when we went it was sleeping :(The place is very nice and the tickets are priced fairly. Souvenirs are also aplenty and are very affordable -- would recommend buying your panda souvenirs here.
158,Well worth the visit,my wife and kid loved Pandas so we came here to visit. nice and relaxing little park and we were excited to see the Pandas. Just that there's no cafe or restaurants around so I could see people usually didn't stay there for long.
159,What an experience!,"This is a must do, the venue is easily accessed by cab and cheap entry.  There were two Pandas on our visit and the photo opportunities were wonderful. You have to cross the road a little way up from the entrance to catch a cab home."
160,Sheer Panda-monium,"Pandas is most protect animals in our country, because it is rare , i have visited here with my friends, To get here, we used taxis or bus, The pandas were eating bamboo when I visited, it always sleep and eat the bamboo, but you can pay attention to know their living environment while you are waiting for them to wake up. and the environment is good and quiet, It made me wanted to be a panda which live such a wonderful circumstance. but, i do not accept that it was lived in here, because they origin live in forest. but we tough to take it to satisfy for people, just to watch it, i think it is deprivation the choose power for pandas, so, i do not often go to here, just i have to go when my family call or school activity. because i do not want to see this situration. this is my feeling."
161,Very cheap experience and the bears are gorgeous,"Went to the park to see that pandas.  Made it just in time for their second public lunch.  The keepers call their names to wake them up and slowly, they start stretching, playing with one another, and finally they walk up into a closed area where they get treats.  According to one of the guards, they get juice and fruits on top of the hill.  We were lucky that one twins played along.  Their mother was quite lazy :) Other than the pandas, the park offers some very cute monkeys, a pond with swans, flamingos and ducks.  Unfortunately, the butterflies and birds area was closed.  There is a hiking trail behind the done, so one could easily spend a few hours in the park.  Panda feeding was at 2:30 and 3:30.  Keep in mind that the park is closed on Mondays and that they close for a couple of hours every day (12-2)."
162,Must visit!,"The Giant Panda Pavilion is an easy bus ride from the major tourist attractions in Macau. It is well worth the trip to be able to get up close to the Giant Pandas and the Red Pandas in the adjacent building. During the mornings, the pandas are outside, while after 2pm, the pandas are moved into the air-conditioned pavilion. We went in the morning and enjoyed seeing the pandas outdoors."
163,Amazing - so worth the visit (and crazily cheap 10mop!),"i don't know what I was expecting but this was a poor mans zoo that happened to have a few pandas in it.  The pandas were moving around and eating and made for a couple of good pics, but overall I felt bad for the animals in small cages."
164,Great place for the kids!,"Second time seeing the pandas here and just as good if not better than the first. Well set up, cheap and a great overall experience."
165,Clean and healthy environment for this beautiful beast,You must quietly visit them as part of the requirement. No flash light please.They are absolutely adorable.
166,MOP10 well spent,"It's a quiet and calm place, with some variety of animals ( Panda, Monkeys , Lemures , Parrots , Deer), Because i am in Macau long time is the 3rd time i go see the panda, and it's the 1st one that actually i saw him moving from his place. A lot's of people just saw him eating and some of them more unlucky don t really see him very well.The ticket admission (Just for Panda Pavillion) it's very cheap 10mop, something like 1eur.I Only recommend this for who have small children, or just love animals. If you are in a rush passing by Macau not a place to go.The last visit it's 17:00PM.Have a nice souvenir shop with a lot of Pandas toys and t shirts.Have a place to eat but very ""poor"" (Not a lot of food or juices to choose)"
167,Well worth the visit,"We visited Macau for a day trip from Hong Kong with the main reason for seeing a Giant Panda for the first time & we were not disappointed. We really loved this experience.  The entrance fee was surprisingly cheap & the two pandas live in a massive high air conditioned pavilion. There were few people there at the time, about 3 pm. One panda mainly just slept up on his bamboo perch but the other put on a real show prancing around her enclosure & eating some bamboo right down near the glass only a few feet away.  We spent about an hour there in total as part of a Macau highlights tour arranged at the port."
168,Best to go at feeding time,We went to see the giant panda but didn‚Äôt get to see them. They were sleeping it seems so not much fun in the visit.
169,Giant Panda Pavilion @ Macau,"A very well organized and maintained place. I'd definetely recommend it for nature and animal lovers. It's not a problem to get a taxi to the park but much harder to get one afterwards. Working hours and more information are in my pictures. I went there in the morning, before they even opened the pavillion, best part they let you in the park starting from 9ish though the pavillion itself opens at 10am. According to the guards pandas are the most playfull around 3pm-ish."
170,Terrible service and only 1 Panda that we could see,"Panda is a cute and not an aggressive animal. Although panda looks like dirty and lazy, they are very obedient and clever. The names of the panda are Kai Kai and Xin Xin, they are the presents that China government gives Macau. These two pandas attract many children come to see them. The thicket is not expensive. I have been go there for two or three times. When I went there, the pandas were slept and they had slept more than three hours, so I did not wait them wake up. The location, the pandas are live in Coloane. It is a far way to go there and use a lot of time. The place is very big and clean. In summer, Macau government wants the pandas to be comfortable, so they will turn on the air conditioner. If the tourists want to have a comfortable place for walk, go to this place is the best choice.See the panda maybe is the boring thing for adult but it is the interesting thing for children. If the tourists have children, they can go to see the pandas. Although they need to waste the whole day, their children will be happy to see the pandas."
171,Panda,I went around 3:30 pm during feeding time and it was the most adorable thing! I stayed there for about 30 minutes just enjoying watching the adult and the babies eat and play.  The area where the pandas were was cool.  The other animals were also a delight to watch.  It seems like they're taken care of.
172,Great park - sleepy pandas,"My second time to visit but first time to see the pandas. There were four pandas and they kept on chewing bamboo grass. Can't explain why they're so adorable to watch. We went there before 2pm, the ticket is 2pm-3pm where the pandas are awake, open for viewing & feeding time as well. It's only 10MOP.We bought souvenirs at the souvenir shop where we bought our tickets, very cheap and nice.Aside from pandas, there are monkeys and swans. Also, facility has a wide park to walk.Note: The weather that time was 10-12C."
173,Cheap and worthwhile,"This is great place, beside Panda house, it has very large park and loot of playgrounds for kids. They have some big Panda at the panda house, the ticket is 10 dollar for adult and free for children.They have some rare animals to be care of. Same mongkeys and birds, swans and big lake with gold fish.There are meuseum for panda at the top hill building. Merchandise store is available at the ticketing office."
174,Must see!,"We loved the Panda Pavillion, it was a good way to finish what we thought was a waste of a trip to Macau. Very hard to get a taxi from out the front. Gift shop was reasonably priced."
175,Collective Awwww!,"The place has 2 pandas (one just passed away recently) and many other animal including emus, giraffes and monkeys. There is a couple of play ground and kids can run wild."
176,Boring,"My partner said i went all gooey eyed!! :)  We went at 3pm and they let us in about 15 minutes earlier, i think probably because one of the pandas was out and about.  One slept while we were there so we just saw his/her bum but the other one came right down to the front and sat eating.  For me it was amazing and i am very glad we went.  We were in Macau on a day trip and took a taxi out and then the bus back. You need to go with specific expectations - pandas sleep a lot so i went expecting not to see them but was so excited when i did. I loved it."
177,Visit just to see the Pandas,"If you think that this will be the only opportunity you will ever have to see Pandas, then do visit, However, there are other facilities in China that are superior to this.  Oh, and don't visit between 1pm and 2pm because it is closed for lunch ( this may be for the benefit of the Pandas or the humans I'm not sure which )  There are two Panda enclosures in the exhibition building and on the day we visited ( October 28th ) 3 Pandas were visible.  Another building has enclosures holding Red Pandas, Lemurs and Monkeys and a small aviary.  The property is very well set up with facilities to keep young children amused."
178,Great excursion. Well worth the visit,"The place is very easy to reach from Cotai area, we took a cab there from Sheraton in 5mins (mop25). Park was relatively quiet, it wasnt crowded at all on a friday 11am. We bought the 11am-noon ticket to see the pandas. There were 4 pandas there (3 in one enclosure and the other aduit panda in a different enclosure). Maybe due the timing of our visit, only 2 were awake when we got there and both were busy eating away and the other 2 were sleeping throughout. Very soon (prob 10mins later), the 2nd panda who was eating also went on to sleep. So throughout the almost 1 hr stay, all I can see if 1 panda munching the bamboos. Didnt get to see other panda actions, eg playing etc. Maybe its to do with the timing of visit. I read somehow those who visited at 2pm seemed to be able to see more activities... All in all, i still think its a worthy visit if you loves panda like I do. Return was a bit tricky as it wasnt easy to flag a cab back. So we took the advice from this forum and took a bus from the bus stop across the street. Bus fare is a flat rate mop7 and they dont give change. There was a notice at the bus stop which show the routes of different bus number and their drop off points, so do read those notices  properly so u can decide which bus number to take if you want to stop at Parisian vs Cotai central etc as each route seem to have different drop off points. ps: I do noticed that the buses there also go all the way to the main peninsula."
179,Very Nice enclosure,"A must visit destination. A short trip over from Hong Kong & grabbed a taxi to the panda pavilion.It was so not touristy. You are given an hour slot to visit the panda enclosure, and on our visit, it was quiet. 2 pandas were asleep, but one was happily eating his bamboo. I guess we fell lucky as they do do a lot of sleeping.After our panda slot, we had a wander around the rest of the park to look at the other animals (deer, monkeys, flamingoes, red pandas), and checked out the gift shop.Then jumped on a bus from the stop on the other side of the road back to Macau casino area for a bite to eat before getting the ferry back to Hong Kong."
180,Very cute pandas üêº ,Only one panda is there in the pavilion. MOP/HKD 10 is the fee to see the panda for 1 hour. Panda is kept in a enclosed artificial forest setup. If you want to see a Panda go here. Easily accessible by Bus. Bus has stop announcement in English also. Only problem in taking a bus is the payment for ticket. You will not get change for the ticket price. The way the panda eats the bamboo is more like a human eating sugarcane.
181,Visit November 28 2016,You can wander around the sanctuary free of charge but if you need to pay to see the giant pandas.  A little disappointed there were only 3 but then I guess better to not have too many in captivity!  Very spacious grounds but it was late in the day and quite quiet when we got there by bus.  A little out of the way to get to.
182,2 giant pandas ... that's it!,"The entrance fee is 10 MOP but the staff accept HKD, as per. The animals look happy and are well taken care of. The pandas, of course, are the main attraction. I only got to see 3 out of 4. They were sleeping for most of my visit but my slot (15:00 - 16:00) is their sleeping time, so come earlier. Their merchandise is considerably cheap too and the funds go to the Panda Fund. Definitely worth visiting."
183,Panda,There was only one panda to view at that time and he/she was asleep :( But the rest of the park/garden was nice to explore especially when you are with children.
184,Very cute attraction for kids,"Macau giant panda village is not far from our hotel. We decided to go there by public transportation from in front of hotel. At that time there are 4 pandas. We go there at 2pm, that's their meal time. They are soo cuteee üòçüòç But remember to bring small money there since they don't have small money for change when i want to buy the ticket. So i have to use card. The ticket price only 10MOP for adult and free for child."
185,Spot a Panda,"When i visited, the pandas were busy mating. Apart from that, there is absolutely nothing in this place. So was kind of disappointed."
186,Expectations made me upset,"Not only you can find panda, they also have a few types of animals (Monkeys, Parrots, peacock, Red panda, Lake with Black Swans and Flamingos). A panda museum with their panda growth journeys, a small kids drawing play area at 2nd level of the museum. Playground can be found around the park and another plant museum on right side upon entrance. Quite a few decoration around the parks you can take pictures with. Kids below 12 and elderly above 60 enter for free."
187,Cute pandas,"When we were there, one of the pandas was sleeping, and the other one was eating.Nice park to walk around and relax.Overall it was ok for me.Good thing entrance fee is cheap."
188,The two cute pandas,"Macao Giant Panda Pavilion is designed to take advantage of combining the terrain's natural undulations with the architectural characteristics. The Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is in Seac Pai Van. Only few building around the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. You will comfortable and relaxed here. Only a pair panda in the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. There are so cute. They always eat bamboo or sleeping. The ticket of the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is only 10 MOP, there are full air conditioning in the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. Viewing location is near to Panda, so you could watch the panda nearly. The environment of the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is very beautiful and clean. Suitable for a family to visit. But the most bad thing is very far from the center of the city and have a lot of trouble to been there. Outside the park, there is the Macao Giant Panda Gift Shop, which is dedicated to selling gifts and souvenirs related to giant pandas. You could buy some souvenir there. It is hard to see panda in peacetime. But in Macau, you are easy to see the panda. Panda are national treasure and rare animals, we should protect them. If you let your child know more about it, you could go to the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion."
189,Pandas were busy making more Pandas,"There is plenty to see at Seac Pai Van Park and most of it is free. The only thing you have to pay for is the Giant Panda pavilion which costs $10 Macau (very cheap). When we were there there was 2 enclosures one with 2 quite active pandas and one with a single one just sleeping.We got a free casino bus from the ferry terminal to ""City of dreams"" and then a cheap taxi ride to the park.We went straight to the pandas - they weren't strict on times but I got the impression they might be if it was busy. After about 30-45 minutes we had a look around the rest of the exhibits for perhaps an hour."
190,"Cheap, peaceful and cute","I have always wanted to see a panda, and we saw 4 in large, open and well designed enclosures. Excellent designed park and we did the nature trail and explored the other exhibits. Great visit"
191,It's in the middle of nowhere and we didn't see any pandas,Hard to believe how cheap this was to visit. Catching the local bus was interesting but it does tell you next stops in English.  Only saw one bear but he performed nicely!  There are also other exhibits in the park which are free - unbelievably good value.
192,Really Value for Money to watch the lovely Panda,"Both pandas were out and about doing panda type things today. Eating, walking, playing, and dozing. I got there for the three o'clock times lot as other people have recommended and was glad I did. It wasn't too busy and they were ...well... as active as I imagine pandas get! ;) I'm always torn in these type of places about feeling sorry for the animals for being locked up and being grateful I got to see them. The enclosure wasn't too bad, but the same can't be said for the rest of the 'zoo'. Small cages, not enough shade, very little in the way of what would be considered natural habitat for the animals."
193,Panda!,"I brought my daughter here as pandas are rare. It turned out to be more of a zoo with pandas being in small enclosures. The enclosures imitate their natural environment but they are still small. There were other animals such as monkeys, lemurs and falcons in small enclosures as well. I would explore other ways to see animals in the wild. This didn't cut it for me."
194,nice park,"This place is actually a bit far off the urban areas in Macau, and you will have to take a bus or get there by taxi...The Panda Pavilion is in fact inside a nature park, where admissions is free, and there is a good range for a small park, including monkeys, gorillas, flamingos, a herb garden etc... But the highlight is the Panda Pavilion... The crowd control seems fine (as there weren't that many visitors), but the staff should start telling people to stop using flash on their cameras! Overall, this quiet little place can be a great relaxing point... Good for small groups or couples!"
195,A Must See,"We visited Macau Giant Panda pavilion in June 2015. There are local Macao buses available to go to the pavilion, but Taxi is the easiest. The first thing that comes to our mind, vast stretches of green garden. The pavilion is nicely organised and there is also a nature trek available past the Panda pavilion. There is a small kids play area and a small conservation centre, which explains about the lifecycle of Panda. The panda pavilion is a small dome which is centrally air conditioned for the pandas. You would be lucky if you are able to see the pandas near close, as most of the time they are sleeping. There are 2-3 enclosure for the pandas, not much to see after 10 min. There are other animal exhibits. Finally, there is a souvenir shop like all other tourist attractions. Overall this is a nice pass time for a couple of hours, preferable by Taxi but local bus services are also available from Stadium bus stop."
196,Good place to bring your kids to and enjoy a quiet escape,"one panda just slept for the entire time that we're there. Fortunately the other one stood up,took a bath ,scratched his body, ate for a few minutes then slept again. Most of your time will be spent waiting for them to get out of their hiding places or to wake up."
197,Giant Pandas in their natural habitat,Amazing pandas and the entire zoo show different animals from different part of the world it is good to enjoy with family friends and travelers who loves animals üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº
198,My first time seeing a panda this close!,"Part of the Seac Pai Van Park in Coloane, this is the best place to see the Giand Pandas in their natural habitat. The enclosures are fairly large, glass fronted and offer a clear view while maintaining a natural element for the Pandas. So it is easy to see the Giant Pandas walking, eating or just playing around. Plaques in front of the enclosure provide details about the name, age and behavior of the Pandas.The park is located away from the main attractions but is easily reachable by public transport.Definitely worth a visit if you are an animal lover or want to see the Giant Panda."
199,Pandas,A very fun few hours were spent here.  The pandas were active which was excellent.  The grounds were lovely.
200,Glad to see panda ,"It is relatively easy to get to this place if your hotel is in Taipa. It a barely 10 mins taxi ride. But do go for the 10-11am or 3-4pm slot as the 1 single panda will be feeding then. If u go during the other time slots. Chances are the panda, Kai Kai, is sleeping. Some monkeys, lemurs, black swans & flamingos around but the really nothing too much to look at. But with entrance fees at 10 mop, it's quite a nice & quiet way to spend an hour. Wear good walking shoes if you intend to take the natural trail with rugged steps around the park after the panda enclosure."
201,A Visit for a Panda,Decided to go to this place last minute was an hour early for the panda but there was plenty to do while waiting For the price you pay see real pandas it is well worth it. A good day out for the family or to enjoy yourself.
202,Lovely panda pavilion,We walked a 40 minute walk from the Venetian Hotel to the gardens. The entrance was free but to see the pandas was only 10MOP. We saw many animals and the pavilion was well kept. We were very lucky to see the two new baby pandas play and they were absolutely adorable! Staff are also very friendly.
203,tour,"We went to the Seac Pai Van Park since we wanted to do something more special apart from just gambling, eating local food and watching shows in Macau.Buses are quite easy to catch and most buses go to Coloane stop at this park.We went in a Sat afternoon and wasn't surprised at all how few people there was LOLTicket only caused HKD10@ but be reminded that the ticket is only valid for that particular session which lasts for 1 hour only, e.g. 3-4pm / 4-5pm...Don't worry 1 hour in that Panda Pavilion is more than enough.There are 2 pandas but I only saw 1 that afternoon.The female panda actually just gave birth to 2 little babies in June - pictures are sooooo adorable, so maybe she was taking care of the babies by the time.There are few other 'houses' for different species of monkeys in the Park as well.We spent a bit more than an hour in the park as it is not a big one afterall.If you are a hiking lover, there is a short hike starting and ending at the park as well.So my suggestion is, If you are staying in the Cotai area, you can had a full breakfast at the hotel then spend the afternoon hiking, followed by going to Coloane to enjoy lunch / tea at famous Lord Stow's Bakery (that's our plan as well =])I think this is still a good place to good if you have enough crazy time in the casinos and those crowded sightseeing places."
204,Pandas were welcome site.  Had to pay to go see them though.,"This place is shows the panda. It lives in there. The pandas come to Macau two years ago. Many children love them so much. They are so cute. This is the gift. Chinese government gave the gift to Macau people in two years ago. It in order to celebrate the Macau returns to china 15 years. It is lucky for Macau people. because panda is the national treasure of china. Chinese government is pay attention to the situation of panda. They care about the health of panda. They monitor the number of panda. This is very important to Chinese government. Because the number of panda is become less and less. Thus, this time they gave to Macau two pandas. This is so lucky for macau people. the panda is so cute. They always eat and sleep. They have a black eyes, hand and foot. Other place is white. This is funny. They climb the tree slowly. And they look like so stupid. But people like their image. For me, I will not like it so much. Because it just will eat and sleep. But I will recommend people to visit. Because this is the important note to macau. Macau also do well in take care."
205,Must visit!,"When I read how much pandas eat, and that the bamboo had to be imported from a particular region of  China, I was aghast! Also there was an electric fence around the panda enclosure!! They had ostriches on the same property on such small piece of land, it was just sad. All the animals enclosures seemed too cramped for space. This was a big let down."
206,Closed till mid July,"Pandas are definitely what you come for but the place also offers Ostrich, Gibbons, Lemurs, flamingos etc .. its a nice 2-3 hour spent there. Something off casino track to be done in Macau...."
207,"Only 1 panda now, sadly","We viewed the pans pavillion, and left feeling it had so much more potential. Although we got to see three pandas sleeping, and a rather active red panda, we felt the conservation aspect could be more. There were other animals on display including Lima, koi and swans."
208,Adorable Pandas,"This is a short bus trip from the centre of Macau, however well worth the effort, especially when the pandas are very active as they were while we were there."
209,Uninteresting park,"I have gone there twice, the reason for me to visit it twice is that the place is very comfortable, it is a unforgettable experience. The entry fee is 10 MOP, it is cheap, because it is very hard for people to see a Panda in Asia. There are two pandas in the pavilion and they always sleeping, it is almost no chance for you to see them moving, because they are too lazy. Advise for the people who visit there, please be quiet and it is a good place for you to visit if you love pandas."
210,Panda's,It is like small zoo with little animals and birds. It can be used for pleasure or for some facts about animals for educational purpose too. It is in good location not far from hotels too. It was worth visiting here if your in Macau.
211,Well organized place with 2 utterly cute giant pandas,"The Pandas were a very reasonable price to see.  The Park itself felt a bit run down, and there were not a lot of people there.  The actual viewing of the Panda Pavillion gave a clear view of the Panda if it was sitting in clear view."
212,Go before  the pandas eat ,"The panda enclosure is really nice. A lot of money has obviously been spent to make them feel at home, and when we were there, two out of their three pandas were active - well, as active as pandas can be. Which is to say they were sitting on their fat butts and eating bamboo...There are also other enclosures where you can see birds, monkeys and a red panda too. So Macau is not all about the casinos after all ..."
213,My wife loved it,"Located on Cotai Island and is a bit distance away from the main city. Kids can get to see Panda and few of the other animals like Ostrich, Monkeys, water birds etc."
214,Visit 2 Giant Panda on Friday evening,"If you love nature and want to learn more about animals, then visit the Macau Zoo. It is located in the Seac Pai Van Park, where you will find a lot of greenery, picnic areas, and playgrounds. After having a morning picnic, I wandered around the park. It is designed as a giant fan occupying 3,000 m2 and its goal is to coexist with the nature surrounding it. Part of the Macau Zoo is the Giant Panda Pavilion, famous for being the home of giant pandas and red pandas ‚Äì a species I didn‚Äôt know! The pavilion is surrounded by a 600 m2 yard, has 900 m2 of indoor exhibition rooms, and 2 parts of 33m2 for activities, all creating spectacular images never to be forgotten!"
215,Panda is so cute!,"The pavilion is a bit of a way out of anything else. We warmed from Paris and it was about 30 mins. Tried to hail a taxi back but there are none. We arrived at 12:45 and were told it shuts at 1, and we couldn't wait around so just had a very quick visit! You pay $10 to see the pandas, and you book an hour slot. We only saw 1 panda and it stayed at the top of its enclosure. It was nice to see a panda as I haven't before. There are also various other wildlife such as red pandas, monkeys, flamingoes, birds etc you don't have to pay to see."
216,A cool thing to do on a hot day,"Very easily accessible by public bus or taxi from Cotai, this is a real gem, and very cheap too. Beautiful giant pandas on display interacting with their handlers. We visited just before 4pm and saw them being fed which made for a lovely experience. They had the young twins playing around when we went and they were the cutest ever. Wonderful animals, looked very well kept in this facility. There were red pandas and some other animals too, but the black and whites have to be the star attraction.Highly highly recommended."
217,The panda is very cute~,"It's nowhere near the vastness of the Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, but this small zoo still offers you the chance to come close to one of the rarest animals in the world.Tickets (to see the pandas) are cheap (10 MOP per person; children under 12 years are free of charge) and the surroundings are refreshingly pleasant (with plenty of other animals and gardens to see). You can reach the Pavilion by taking bus 21A, 25, 50, or 26A to Seac Pai Van Park station. It closes on Monday.One hour is enough to walk around the premises and see almost everything.Right next to the Pavilion you can also find a (free!) shuttle bus to the top of the A-Ma Cultural Village. This bus departs every 30 minutes."
218,Macau Giant Panda Pavilion,They are very cute eat a lot of food play around best time to see is 2 pm when feeding them. Catch bus 26A from Macau worth a visit
219,Funny Day,It was great to see this amazing rare animal at so close quarters. Got an education which enlightened me to their plight. It is a must see.
220,Cute Panda,"There are so few pandas in captivity, especially outside of China, that we felt we must go and see the panda since we were only a five minute drive away.There a few other animals to see including some very cute ring tailed lemurs, but obviously the panda is the main attraction.  We were lucky enough to catch him at feeding time, which was between 14:00 and 15:00, and could see him being very active and enjoying the bamboo.  It was a brilliant experience, and the panda seemed to be well looked after and very content.There isn't a lot else to keep you entertained, although the area was extremely tranquil and a welcome change from the extremely busy Cotai strip. It is also worth mentioning that to see the panda they charge 10 Hong Kong dollars, which is less than 1 pound sterling!  an absolute bargain!!"
221,Cute Panda,"I wrote a review for another place which was supposed to be ibtended for this. Anyway, as I mentioned in my previous review, we really enjoyed here. The pandas are too cute! It's also my first time in Macau so everything really amazed me. I would definitely visit this again with my family next time!"
222,Fun visit to see the pandas!,The place is a bit far from the main entertainment and it's very difficult to get a taxi on the way back. Both pandas been asleep and very far from the windows so our child even didn't understood what are we looking at. All other animals also been hiding from the hit. So I thing it's a waist of time going there during the hot season.
223,cute!,"Went today. What a bargain! AUD $1.60 to watch the bears for an hour.I have been to Beijing enclosure for Pandas and it does not compare.The animals here look happy and clean, the pavilion is spotless and the staff friendly.Keep it up and do not hesitate to go here."
224,Cute panda,"What a gem only a short distance from the casino glitz.Caught the local bus (very frequent) from in Macau which drops you at the door to the park - 3.20mop with multiple bus routes serving the area (bus 25, 50, 21a). Entry to the park is free & you can see various animals for free - monkeys, birds, flamingos, red panda & 20mop to see the pandas (4 of them).After that we caught the same bus back hoping off in the Cotai Casino strip (only a few stops) for some sight seeing.I reckon a must do if visiting Macau, especially around feeding time (around 3.30 yesterday)."
225,Amazing animal,"We arrived for the 11pm-12nn slot but when we got inside the pavilion (2 windows only), there was only 1 panda and it was sleeping!!! We spent about 15 minutes inside with nothing happening and we almost left. Good thing we didn't! Because 3 pandas were let out and they were happily eating bamboo and playing around with each other! What a precious sight. I'm so glad we waited. Take note that taxis are not queuing here waiting for passengers to bring home. The staff are friendly though and they will direct you to the nearest bus stop (you need to cross the street).It's hot in the park but it's cool in the pavilion."
226,Wonderful,"The panda pavillion is in a well maintained park housing other animals, gibbons, monkeys, parrots, flamingoes that are free to view. The tickets are cheap at 10MOP. There is a interesting information centre about the family of 4 pandas staying in the panda pavillion. Visitors can have a clear view of the panda munching bamboos during feeding time. We enjoyed our visit here"
227,should not be missed,"My cousin with her son came to MacauÔºåso I decided leading them to Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. Because there are a few of places which is suitable for child at Macau. The Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is one of the best choice. There are many Furnishing in the park. I had taken many photos with my nephew. He looked so happy and glad. Then we started to visited the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. But we saw two pandas called Kai Kai and Xin Xin. They were continuing to eat when we visited. But it is cute, many children who in the Giant Panda Pavilion were attracted by it.The ticket is very cheap, it only costs Mop10 per person. Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is big. The pandas are cute and active. So I think it is worth to visit Macau Giant Panda PavilionBut traffic is not good, there are litter bus can arrive Macau Giant Panda PavilionRecommendation: Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is closed on Monday. Please don‚Äôt come to Macau Giant Panda Pavilion on Monday. Macau Giant Panda Information Center is free to public. There are a lot of interesting information which about foster pandas. It is very suitable that parents bring with their child to know more about nature."
228,Dream Come True,We went to see the Panda's and it was great.  We arrived just after it opened and there was no one there.  We paid to see the Pandas and it wasnt very much.  They cam close to the glass.  Loved it
229,Just so so ,"Our grandchildren enjoyed watching the panda as well as the grown ups. It's a pity, the partner passed away, now he is alone."
230,Love the pandas...not sure about the rest of it,"The Giant Panda Pavilion is located within Seac Pai Van Park near Coloane Village. Here visitors can spend up to one hour (MOP10) with resident pandas in a state of the art enclosure. The pandas are very cute and enjoyable to watch when they are active, usually during feeding time. Unfortunately, these are very lazy animals that sleep much of the day so there is also a high chance that they will do nothing but sleep during your visit. Opening hours are 10-1pm and 2-5pm daily (Closed on Mondays). You buy entry tickets from the ticket counter near the actual enclosure. Entry takes place on the hour, each hour in which tickets are sold."
231,"Amazing animals, terrible location",We had a short visit to the panda exhibit. They close early so we barely made it. Closure at 17:00. The place is well kept and the animals seem well handled too. Pandas are lovely creatures and the other animals were too.
232,Pandas!,Location at Taipa. Travellers are suggested by bus to be here. Suitable family visiting. Can spend half day.
233,Zoo!,"The cost from Venetian would be around HK 40 Dollars.  Its a nice pavillion with not only the Panda but also other animals like lemur, flamingo, fish, etc.  It has two Giant Panda and some really nice souvenir shopping."
234,Pandas!!!,"I read the reviews and I was uncertain when I said ""lets do this"" as we headed for Macao. We had kids with us so just gambling on Macao was never an option. We hopped  a cab from the Wynn Palace (39 hk$) and were dropped off at the entry to Giant Panda within 10 minutes. The cost of entry was $10 hk for adults and free for kids under twelve. We had two 11 year olds and the cashier asked to see their passports. Of course we had them as we needed them for the crossing. You are given a ticket for a one hour viewing and we headed directly to the enclosure. I knew that feeding time was four o'clock and as it was about 3:30 we wasted no time. The panda out in the enclosure was pacing and sure enough not long after we arrived his meal of bamboo shoots was delivered. It was awesome. He just sat down facing all of us and started munching! Awwww translates in any language and we all just sighed and laughed and smiled at one another, enjoying an international moment of joy. In my mind that is the ultimate travel moment and it came at the cost of ten Hong Kong dollars, barely more than a $1. I call that an amazing deal. So do I recommend it? Absolutely. Will some people say it's only got a few other animals and is kind of shabby? Yes, they will. No, they don't have a restaurant but they do have a small gift shop. I don't mind that it isn't overly commercialized. The staff was friendly and they did have a play area for the kids. Our kids said it was a highlight and that's good enough for me."
235,Nice to meet you KaiKai,"Took a taxi to see the pandas.   Very disappointing.   There was only one panda to be seen.   All but one exhibit was empty.  Panda that was visible was against the back wall, and we only caught a glimpse of it behind the bamboo."
236,Mini Zoo,"In my childhood, I have gone to the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion, because I like animals, so when I know that Macau have two Pandas, I feel excited and go to meet them instantly. I go with my family member, I saw the decorations in the Park, those decorations attract us a lot and let us get high expectation. Finally I saw two cute Panda, I think they have fun a lot and eat a lot, but one of them eat much more than another one, so this Panda is fatter than another a lot. I have seen an interesting thing that is they have a defcation in front of us, this is the first time I saw this situation, we felt astonished. I saw some messages said that this location is too far away, but I think Macau is a tiny city, we can go to anywhere within an hour almost one and half hour maybe. And if I don‚Äôt know how to go to somewhere, I search the internet, there are plenty of information online, so Macau people do not need to worry about the traffic problem basically. It is a nice place to children and family."
237,Activity for one hour,"I love bears and panda bears are my favorites. Came here with my son in June via a cab. Arrived before 4 PM and purchased tickets for the 4 PM showtime!!! It was feeding time and got to see the pandas eat bamboo. On panda put all the bamboo on top of its body and begin munching while lying on its back. Reminded of me eating on a couch lying down.When they were done eating, they slowly walked around, hit the tethered ball, dumped their butt in a big bucket of water and saw them poop stinky doo dooüí©Definitely a great place to visit to see panda. The facility was air conditioned and cool in the oppressive heat. Come during the 4 pm feeding time to see them wide awake üêºAlmost forgot, they also got cute red pandas in another facility. Don't forget to drop by to say hi to them too!"
238,Very cute and big pandas!,We booked a private tour at the ferry terminal and we had a very good driver who took us all around Macau and then finished at the pandas at 1500 which was a good time to visit they was playfull and full of life
239,Be lucky to see a Panda awake!!!!,"The location is far from city heart and only a few public buses can reach, yet it is worth to come and experience it. Macau is not only casino but also some outdoor place worth to spend a day on. The area is not as big as I think but you can see a variety of animal and plant over there. It is very releasing and the educational center is worth to spend an hour on it. It is surprise that the admission fee is not much too."
240,Very Active Pandas!,"I visit last year but i heard the panda die of kidney failure. It cost less than $1 for 2 people. small and tidy. But the cages are too small for some animals. It looks a bit abuse for the bigger animals. I don't like zoo fell a bit cruel for nature. They can keep some small insects, and big fish tanks or some tropical world will be more suitable."
241,Defiately worth a visit!,"Make sure to have a Macau's number, the staff will not help you to call a taxi even knowing that you have little children. To call a taxi you need to have a Macau/HK number, roaming won't work.Animals at this exhibit are healthy and great Pandas. I've seen the pandas but will never go back, had really bad experience with the staff here."
242,"Another must see while in Macau, if you can't make it to Mainland China, then do visit here.","Hi and thx for reading. Was there recently as 2A&2C (14&15years)Positive- excellent short trip. We utilised 2 hours only- superb price MOP10 per head, younger than 12 is cheaper- bus stop at less than 100 steps away- shaded fm heat, air condition for giant panda and its cousin the red panda- part of Seac Pai Van Park at Coloane and its mini zoo, exercise stations is free if one doesn't wishes to visit the giant panda - has sheltered place for a picnic with big fans to cool oneself and clean enough toilets- souvenirs obtainable fm the office where one buys ticket for the giant panda pavilion Negative- no food stalls though we don't mind as we brought our own.Tips:-- head straight towards end of Coloane to enjoy local food, historical sites, beach before visiting this park/zoo- public bus is cheap, high frequency (average 10mins wait), air condition, free wifi, clean and 10mins ride from Cotai or from end of Coloane.- exact currency are needed for public buses thus get ready with coins.- separate air conditioned, big size glass enclosure for each of the two giant panda. Place yourself at the 4-6 glass panes from the start or from the end to catch a good view. As it's only an hour allowed, get it best & purchase the 1530-1630 slots fm the office as feeding preparation is at 1545.Hope this helps :)"
243,Great place if you're lucky,"To get there you don't need shuttles etc. Go to the Lisboa hotel/Casino, to the left there is a lot of bus stops. Catch the 26A, it's 6 Mop each. The bus takes 35 mins and stops right outside the panda park. We got there at 2pm (closed for lunch 1pm_2pm). It is only 10 Mop each, over 65 is free. We saw the pandas first, they were sat feeding, we watched them for about half an hour. It was only us and 10 other people there. We got some brilliant photos. After we went to see the story of the Pandas, interesting. There are a few other animals to see and some nice grounds that are all very well maintained.  The animals seem well cared for. Don't forget....you are not going to a full sized zoo, it's all about the pandas here. We would of happily paid more. We went in their little cafe and had a decent coffee, again very cheap. When you leave, cross the road and get the 26A bus back to the grand Lisboa."
244,Cuteness personified and educational too.,"The park is good and it has two giant panda in its Pavilion. There are also birds aviary and animals in the park. Overall it is good, but do not have too much of expectations. Also visit the nearby A-Ma (Matsu) Cultural Village temple. The pavilion is closed on Mondays. If the Monday is a public holiday, the pavilion closes on Tuesday instead. Timings: 10:00-13:00, 14:00-17:00 (Last entry 16:45). Park is opened from 8am to 6pm.Entry fee to see the panda: MOP10Getting there: Bus: 25, 26A, 21A, 50 - The entrance of the park is on the right side of Seac Pai Van Park bus stop.Note: This park do not have drinking water facility. But you can buy from them."
245,Cute pandas,"The Panda Pavilion was initially not a part of our itinerary, we actually found it on the Tourist map and instantly decided we wanted to visit. And boy, was that a great decision!The Pavilion is large, spacious, uncrowded (as most tourists do not go here) and has a large variety of animals to see including ofcourse the Giant Pandas and the Red Pandas.Coming to the Star Attractions - the Giant Panda enclosure has 1 hour sessions. The enclosure is huge and houses 4 pandas- mumma, papa and two 1 - year old male siblings. It is preferable if you visit during their lunch hour (we took the 1pm session)- as pandas do only two things, eat and sleep, and they are much more fun to watch doing the former!They are insanely cute and adorable with all their antics and incessant bamboo eating. Do not forget to take loads of photos and videos!The Souvenir shop is a must visit. It has lots of cute Panda themed gifts which are very well priced. We came back with tons of coasters, magnets and luggage tags.All in all, must visit if you would like to see Giant Pandas!"
246,Tour of macau,"Very clean and well organised. There are 2 Pandas which are fed at 10 am, 2 pm and 3.30 pm. I would advise to visit just prior or at the feeding time as the Pandas are sleepy after eating. Taxis are difficult to find when you leaving but we used the public bus which was recommended by the staff which  stops at all the hotels in the Taipa area."
247,Nice place,"Our sole purpose of our visit to Macau was to see the Giant Pandas. We took a taxi from the ferry terminal. Entry into see the Giant Pandas is HK$10 per adult (children are free). There are also a few other animals that can be seen here, there is also a couple of small play parks for children. Great place to spend an hour."
248,One Panda.,"I went to visit the Panda Pavilion whilst in Macau. I was staying at the City of Dreams so got a taxi which was around $40.  It's only $10 to enter.  There are a few other animals but my main reason was to see the pandas.  Other reviews had said to visit around 1530.  We entered the enclosure around that time.  One panda was fast asleep but was hugging the rock and made a great photo opportunity.  The other Panda was outside and I was incredibly lucky to find it walking around then coming to eat some bamboo before walking to the top of the enclosure.I really think its hit or miss what you get to see but for just $10 its worth it.  Getting back to the hotel is a little more complicated, there arent any taxis waiting at the site and the staff suggested the bus.  It stops about 400m and its service 50 back to C.O.D and just $5(correct fare)  There is a display at the front to tell you the correct stop"
249,Fun place for all ages!,"Had a day in Macau so after exploring the north side, took the bridge over to see the south island. Coloane is a bit of a miss to be honest, but a visit to see the pandas mix in well with a trip to the big hotels just up the road. No need to spend longer that half an hour, but this trip will ensure a good bunch of photos and videos of pandas, and will enable you to knock this one off your bucket list."
250,Great value for money. Certainly worth a trip for families.,"Caught a taxi from our hotel (Sheraton Cotai Strip) direct to the panda pavilion cost 29 mop so cheap as chips and got us there in less than 5 minutes. Be aware the cabs do not have seat belts and the drivers like to go fast!  As you walk in the gates the shop/ticket office is directly to your right. You must purchase a ticket if you want to see the Pandas. Once ticket is in hand walk straight ahead to the pathway entrance to the pavilion- you‚Äôll see 2 or 3 guards waiting to take your ticket. Once inside there are two large areas with Pandas. On the day we went there was an adult with two young Pandas and in the next one just an adult. There is also an interesting display about the Pandas and how much they eat- you can even see some panda poop. On the glass there is information on each panda in Chinese & Portuguese, if you keep walking the next windows have the same information in English. You can stay as long as you like, take pics and videos. Really fantastic to see them close up. When we arrived about 2.15 they were quite active walking around, eating and interacting with each other. By about 4 pm they were all settling down for afternoon naps.We then viewed the red bears and various monkeys before making some purchases from the shop, all very reasonably priced e.g. 9mop for a cute little key ring.To get back to the strip exit the park, turn right and walk to the overpass. There is a lift and escalator up. Cross the road and you come down at the bus stop. We were told all buses (except 50) will take you back to the strip. We‚Äôd just missed one as we crossed so again flagged down a cab and again 30 mop got us back to our hotel."
251,"Nice experience, but not much pandas to be seen","To view these popular attractions with no crowd and for the princely sum of MOP10 ......... priceless. Access to view these beautiful animals is for one hour, and if you timed your arrival right at the start you get to stay for the full 60 minutes. These pandas are housed in a climate controlled pavilion with ample space to amble around should they choose to. But when we were there all they did was chew and chomp on their bamboo, as they would. However, it was the luxury of not needing to jostle with a large crowd that was the best highlight of this visit pandas are such a crowd-puller in any zoo. The Seac Pai Van Park that the Giant Panda Pavilion is housed in is a pretty park right on the opposite side of the high-rised apartment blocks that lined the Estrada de Seac Pai Van. Stay the full hour if you can but I was just happy to take my time, and my photos and video, without jostling for a vantage point."
252,lazy panda,This was the first time we had seen a panda and it was great to be able to get so close to see Kai Kai very clearly and for just 20 MOP. We were able to access this attraction by taxi from one of the large hotels and then caught a local bus back which was a very simple process.
253,Super Cute,"There are several public buses going here, and the bus stop is very close. The entrance fee is ridiculously cheap, panda is not an animal you see in many zoos, and there are not that many atractions in Macau, so this is a good spot. True, maybe panda will be sleeping and you do not get to see it. Also, do not expect it to do anything entertaining, if it is not sleeping, it will be eating and that is it. You get to stay in an enclosure for one hour, hopefully you are lucky to see it in that time, and if you see it, you will make a couple of photos and go away after ten minutes... Then you can have a great walk around the area through the forest, and the path will lead you again to the enclosure, so after an hours walk maybe you get lucky to see panda (once again). People generally do not try to be silent and they were extremely noisy when we were there. There are other animals in the zoo, many different birds, deer, monkeys, ostriches (most look very sad and bored since the cages are small indeed - this should be improved). There is also a plant area if you are interested - medicinal herbs, for example. There is a panda museum (more for kids than for adults) and couple of other museums related to plants and animals. Small cafe does not offer much in terms of food, but the coffee was ok. Gift shop has some nice non-expensive tshirts and all sorts of mostly panda inspired souvenirs. There is a lot of building around, but no noise. It is a green jem in the construction sight. Interesting place to visit, especially if you have never seen a panda before. Walk is really nice, try to do it."
254,Panda Boys,"It is easy to take bus to/from the pavilion but beware it is hard to get a taxi from there. And it close on Monday and lunch time.Panda mostly sleep after eating, when we visit we missed the feeding time. According to staff it was 10am and 2pm, do call and check again with pavilion before visit. The tickets are very cheap and free for kids below 12years old and senior above 65. (Just show passport to the ticket counter)The price of soveniurs is quite fair if consider to support the panda. And we bought each of us very nice panda t-shirt. It is a short visit but good scenery to take photo. We love panda and so happy to have many cute panda statues to take photo together along the way."
255,Well maintained park,This place is easy to get to via public buses. The best thing is : it is not crowded and the entrance fee at present is only Mop 10 per person.These pandas are very playful and active. It is really fun yo watch. The place is air conditioned so it is really cool. I can spend hours on it. An oasis of calm.
256,Giant Panda Pavillion,"We went to he panda pavilion in jan 2015.The place and set up was good, but the pavilion had only one panda. Initially there were 2 pandas, but some time ago one of them died, hence left with only one.They issued us a ticket for one hour, And within 10 mins, the panda left for lunch for an hour..Also the maps and signs very not very clear and informative..Overall..not as expected.."
257,So cute! Cheap day out for all ages,I've been here three times during three different months.   The pandas were asleep every time.  The garden area is pretty.  There are a few other animals to view.
258,Lovely Panda,"You will want to go here during the day, preferably when it opens. It apparently is mobbed on weekends.  They had several beautiful pandas who spend an awful lot of time eating and this was great fun to watch.  You are only allowed in the pavillion for about 15-20 minutes and then the next group comes in.  However, it is plenty of time to view these glorious animals.  They also have red pandas which look like very large and beautiful raccoons.  Definitely a must see. Ticket prices are inexpensive."
259,Waste of time sadly,"Our visit here was brief, as they only have a few Pandas.  It is a very small facility, easy to find on the 26A bus.  The entrance fee is cheap and we only stayed for about 20 minutes - that was heaps of time.  Probably not worth the trip out, unless you are absolutely desperate to see a Panda and you don't have an opportunity to go elsewhere to see one."
260,Waste of time,Easy to get to by bus or taxi. √ípend at 10am and is so cheap its practically free. You need only spend 30 mins here as theres not much other than the pandas which are the main draw. They seem well housed and cared for a√±d you get good views. To make a morning of it catch the free minibus next door which takes you to the temple and statue on top of the nearby hill. It runs every 30 mins
261,"Hello, pandas! ","We made 2 trips to Macau Panda Pavilion, one at 11am on a thursday and one at 2pm the following day...The reason we made 2 trips, at 11am they were both fast asleep and doing nothing, and it started to storm shortly after we arrived... we went back to do stuff near our hotel for the rest of the day.As its less than 10 minutes away from the Venetian where we were staying, we returned the following day at 2pm, we were told by another tourist they feed them in the hour break that they close the pavilion each day from 1-2... and as it turned out, that advice was perfect... we walked in at exactly 2pm, and each panda had large amounts of Bamboo spread out for them, both were eating the bamboo, walking, climbing and exploring. The enclosures were nice, and it looked like the pandas were comfortable...My wife had really wanted to see the pandas awake and this made her day... plus it only costs MOP$10 (about $1.60 AUD) for each person to enter. Considering there are also birds, monkeys and childrens play area in the park, it really is nothing..Other bonuses of this part of Macau, next door to the Panda Pavilion is the entrance road to the Ah Ma Temple and Statue (there is a free shuttle bus at the bottom of the hill to take you to the top) and its very close to Coloane... we ended up spending the whole afternoon in and around the area."
262,expecting for more,"Out of the way of all the hotels, but a taxi doesn't cost too much to get down. Entry is very cheap, 10MOP per person which is equivalent to about ¬£1. We heard it was best to go at 4:00, which is feeding time, meaning the pandas will be in clear view, eating for us all to see, so those who complain should go back at this time. Other things to do include a gift shop and more animals, which is nice for a sunny afternoon but not good for a rainy day. It's a day of fun so long as you go at the right time. Hailing a taxi back is hard, but in the housing estate opposite the park there seem to be some so head that way. Overall, worth the very cheap price."
263,Two Darling Pandas,"The Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is in Seac Pai Van. Only few building around the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. You will comfortable and relaxed here. Only a pair panda in the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. There are so cute. They always eat bamboo or sleeping, and fighting... The ticket of the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is only 10 MOP, there are full air conditioning in the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. The environment of the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion is very beautiful and clean. Suitable for a family to visit. But the most bad thing is very far from the center of the city and have a lot of trouble to been there. Outside the park, there is the Macao Giant Panda Gift Shop, which is dedicated to selling gifts and souvenirs related to giant pandas."
264,one panda,"A must see if you have the time. The place is quite far off from where we stayed. It's a nice park with lots of birds, Lemur and other animals. But the main attraction are the Giant Pandas. There are just 2 one male and one female. The preferred time to visit is in the afternoon between 3 to 5 as they are mainly active during that period. We had a good time."
265,highlight of our trip,Two-Three panda kept in air conditioned pavilion. Can be missed if short of time. Its 10 minutes taxi ride from Cotai.
266,Now 2 pandas,Went there on June 29th but were told Panda pavilion is closed till July 14th. We could only visit common areas like park etc around the Panda pavilion. Campus is great- well maintained. Can be visited en route to Hac Sa beach
267,Very small ,"We went to the Panda Park late August and there were very few people, not at all crowded. We got to spend the hour watching the two pandas sleeping. Fortunately they were quite close to the windows so we had a great view. Kai Kai looked as though he had definitely done a little too much celebratingof his 10th birthday as he was draped over a log.The monkeys and red pandas were much more active. The park is quite stunning. Beautifully laid out with gardens, koi ponds and lots of greenery. There is a children‚Äôs playground and plenty of toilets and helpful people.Besides the panda enclosure there is a wonderful information centre where we watched a very informative video. Upstairs there were lots of activities for children. A lovely way to spend a few hours."
268,Find It... If You're Lucky,I enjoyed my visit here. The prices where a little high but the panda's were treated well and i found my visit educational also
269,"Small, but nice and quiet!","An absolute bargain at just 10MOP, with entry to the rest of the park free (although there's only a handful of enclosures with monkeys, birds and of course Red Pandas) the modern enclosure with the pandas in allows you to be pretty close, and seemingly spend as long as you want observing them.The park closes between 1300 and 1400 and it appears the pandas are fed during this point, so aim to get there at 1400 and they'll be eating and fairly lively (for a panda).  The park is a bit too far from the Cotai Strip to walk to (and along main roads) but easy enough to get a taxi there for around 30MOP from the strip.  To get back though you'll need to flag one down at the road or jump on a bus, and taxi's didn't pass too frequently while I was waiting.After you've seen the pandas, don't miss the information centre near the aviary, to find out more about the breeding programme and their protection.  All the information is in English too."
270,Peaceful Panda Enclosure,"We took the advice that we found on here and arranged our visit at about 3.30 pm to coincide with feeding time. We were lucky enough to see both adult pandas and one baby panda eating away on the bamboo and wandering around in front of the cameras. The Pavilion is a $40 (MOP) taxi ride away from the Studio City Hotel and it was a $10 (MOP) entrance per adult with children free, so amazingly good value for money. We really enjoyed our short visit."
271,It's nice for couples with kids or people that love animals,We wanted to do this tour but it was booked out for a month in advance - which was good because apparently there were 2 pandas but one has died - so
272,cute,"Visited in the afternoon when they were feeding, had very close look at them.The place is quite close to the hotels in Cotai strip, easy to reach by taxi.Ticket rates are very less (additional discounts available for seniors)Difficult to get taxis on the way back, however buses are available (bus stop is nearby)Other animals /birds are also available (including flamingos in the open pond)"
273,"Panda was good, Culture was better","Stumble across this place by accident when we took bus from Coloane back to Cotai Strip, decided to explore and it didn't disappoint. You can see few species of monkeys, flamingos, birds and red pandas for free, but to see giant pandas, there is an entrance fee of MOP10 per person. There  were 2 pandas living in the enclosure (although in the information these 2 giant pandas have given birth to 2 new pandas, I guess the latter 2 are kept on special enclosure). The place are well kept and it was a nice experience walking around the park."
274,Definitely worth an hour of your time - feeding time was 14:00,"We arrived with most of them sleeping @ 3pm, but they were soon active with feeding at around 3:20.  One baby stayed asleep. We spent a whole hour just watching and being amused by their antics in getting food and eating.  The red pandas and monkeys were good too. Well worth the visit."
275,"Make sure your expectations are realistic, pandas are very inactive creatures","The place is located in the middle of nowhere. No taxis, no public transport - cotai strip is 1.5 km away. We were there around 13:00 and it was closed for lunch ."
276,Great few hours,"Visited for the first time after arriving at the ferry port from Hong Kong. As entrance to the park is free, you have to go to get the tickets from the main office to purchase a time slot (1 hr) to go into see the pandas.You can go up to the glass or there is a raised walkway to look at the enclosure. During our visit, it was not crowded and had plenty of room to look and whilst 2 of the pandas slept the whole time, we saw the other 2 move around and eat their bamboo (very cute)"
277,Panda is nice .. but maintenance is poor,"Getting to the Panda Pavilion can be quiet easy, even if you don't speak the language. When we got to Macau via the Hong Kong Ferry, we took a free casino bus to the Venetian Casino, (that is worth a look just by itself). There I asked the concierge for help. They gave us the directions to the pavilion and even wrote the instructions in Chinese for us to hand to the taxi driver. You will need a taxi to get there, but it doesn't cost much and they will accept HKD.The Panda Pavilion is in a small little park area. The park itself is nice but that is about it. When you come through the main gates you will see the office on your right, this is where you buy your tickets. Tickets are about 10 MOP ($6 Australian).From there you will directed to the Panda Pavilion. There are two enclosures and hopefully a Panda in each. There was when we went. The whole pavilion is air conditioned, and when it is over 40 degrees outside with high humidity, the area was a paradise. You are able to take photos and get right up to the glass. Take your time and look at both. They are wonderful creatures. That is all that is there to see. If you want a nice little side trip this is not a bad one. You get away from the Casinos and hustle and bustle of Macau, and you get to see Pandas.One bit of advice. Ensure that you get your taxi driver to come back for you or get the office to order you one. You end up a long way from the free casino buses and it is a long walk, especially in the heat. Trust me on that."
278,Quiet and spacious garden,"I lived across the road in One Oasis so visited a few times in July and August this year.Its so cheap - 20 mop to see the pandas and the rest of the park is free! There are 2 pandas and as stated in previous review, make sure you go at around 3pm as that is the feeding time.The pandas have great personalities, they look very happy and well looked after.There is also other animals including monkeys, parrots, flamingos and a friendly deer. The shop is also good and very cheap for souvenirs and also an information building that has a small area for children to read books. Regarding getting a taxi back afterwards.... you can jump on the bus directly outside for approximately 5MOP (very cheap) and most of them (every one but number 50 i believe) go to Taipa or the Venetian, then from there you can easily get a taxi.The only negative comment is that the information on the fence next to the deer says they like to be in groups, and the poor thing is all alone and although still friendly i cant help but think it must be so lonely :("
279,Go if you have time to spare,only paid 10 hkd/mop for entrance fee. I visited this place at  3.30 pm and I have seen the pandas enjoy their meals at 4 pm. You can reach this place by local bus no 26a/21a
280,Very Poor,"Though a small exhibit, it is done very nicely and the cost is very low at the time of my visit only 10 Pataca. Many wonderful opportunities for picture taking with both indoor and outdoor enclosures. Best time to go is late afternoon around 3 or 4 pm, Pandas are more active than during the day, they tend to sleep more."
281,This is a worth a visit,"We were passing after visiting the A-Ma Cultural Village, Tin Hau Temple and A-Ma Goddess Statue on the hill above. It was very cheap to get in and very quiet when we visited - in fact we were the only people in the Panda enclosure apart from one security guard.The Pandas looked somewhat bored wandering around aimlessly which was not pleasant to see although cute with their characteristic faces.OK to see if passing but don't make a special trip."
282,OK,"We caught a taxi to the Pavilion and arrived at 130pm. The pandas enclosure wasnt opened until 2pm, but we had a wander and saw some other animals....monkeys, swan, duck, turtles.At 2pm, we visited the Red Panda...cute, but then visited the Panda enclosure. It was a perfect time to visit as they all came very close to us to eat their bamboo. A wonderful visit!"
283,First panda!,"Waste of time sadly, hardly worth the time it took to get there, we walked around for about 45 mins and realized it was just a big park, no pandas, just a bit dissapointing"
284,Not worth visiting ,"I haven't been to many zoos in my entire life. But the one thing I really dreamed of seeing is a panda. When my wife and I learned it's possible to see one in Macau, we made sure we made a stop in this zoo. It's really out of the way but then again, everything in Macau is really a short distance away from another point. So we had no trouble at all locating the place, taking a bus, all using our map from a tourist information booth. When we got there around 2pm, both pandas were stuck in their nap spots. We wondered when they would move so we could see all their walking and striding. It was tempting to knock on the glass wall but that was a no-no so we had to wait. Before long, they awoke and moved back and forth, always at a distance from left to the right and back. I longed for them to come down the hill toward us. And sure enough they did, climbing a tree here, eating a bark there, and shaking their fluffy bodies. Really cute! For a first-timer like me, it was worth the wait. Fortunately, it didn't rain. It might have been difficult getting back to the city on a rainy day."
285,Cheap place for toddlers,"1st - You need to pay for it, which is not expensive.2nd - Children under 12 and adults over 65 is for free but you need to bring their ID. For adults, i could understand but my sister baby it like 10 months and they were requesting and if you don't show it, you had to pay, what i am pissed it was because another family was next to us being served by another person and he didn't ask for that family to show their kid ID (I think they were korean) and because we spoke Mandarin they were just giving us a pain.3rd - They should tell you that only in the weekends (Afternoon after 2 or 3pm), they show 4 pandas. So if you go any morning, you will only see 1 panda. So they need to tell people about this before paying.4th - I believe that tourist will take a taxi to go there, when you want to leave, it was so hard to get a taxi and they don't really assist you there."
286,"A panda, other animals and a nice walking path through the forest","We visited the Panda Pavilion at 2pm, which turned out to be the perfect time to go as it was feeding time! I would highly recommend visiting at this time of the day as the Pandas were very active. One Panda was playing with a ball, another was climbing over the wooden frames and the others were peacefully munching on bamboo. They are so fascinating to watch and you will find your hour observing the Pandas go very quickly! For 10 MOP it is incredible value. (Students with a ISIC Card get it free)The Panda Pavilion is like no other as it is very quiet with not many visitors. Even our taxi driver hadn't heard of it! There was only about 20 other people there when we visited so you a better viewing experience compared to some other places. At the Panda Pavilion there is also Red Panda's, monkeys and walking trails that are completely free to visit! You will also find a Panda Gift Store that sells mugs, cushions, key rings, t-shirts and the Panda Viewing Tickets. We spent so much in the gift store they also gave us a few freebies which was very nice of them. For someone who adores Pandas I could not recommend this enough."
287,A luxurious playground for the panda!,"We caught a taxi from the strip to the Pavilion. Very reasonably priced journey took about 5 minutes to get there from the Cotai strip. Pavilion is situated in a park that was recently affected by a typhoon so some areas need attention. Purchased tickets to see the pandas at a small building near the middle of the park. Cost is 10MOP per person - very reasonable. Then headed to the Pavilion for the 3-4pm viewing session. 4 Pandas on display- 2 of which were just over a year old and very cute and very active. Staff care about the Pandas and they look well taken care of. Staff will ask people to be quiet if they are too loud. As you enter they do hold signs asking for you to be quite. Pandas were fed just before 4. Panda souvenirs are available where you buy tickets and are reasonably priced. Staff here were friendly and helpful. There are also some other animals here - red pandas, monkeys, flamingos. Overall small park but if you love Pandas a must do. If you heading back to the strip after visiting, walk across the road and towards the red building and you will see a bus stop. You can catch the 25 or 21A bus. Able to pay with cash but change not available cost about $3.90MOP to get back to the strip."
288,Visit the giant panda in Macau,My husband and I visited the Panda Pavilion on our recent trip to Macau. On arrival we were met with surprise this place is a hidden gem! Extremely impressed with the cleanliness and upkeep of the animal enclosures here. The panda‚Äôs were adorable. The entry free of 10 MOP I felt was too cheap they definitely deserved a bit more for how well everything was presented and cared for. There is also a good gift shop to purchase souvenirs. Only downfall was it took as a bit of time to find a taxi to get back into town. Highly recommend making some time in your travel plans to visit!
289,Cute pandas and something more,"I've been to a few zoos trying to get a good look at a panda.  Each time I go, lines are too long, too many people or the pandas are sleeping while they digest their meals.  I went to the Macau Giant Panda Pavillion first thing in the morning (they open at 10am). It was 10 MOP to get in. And I was there with three other people.  Yalin was up front and centre eating his bamboo.  Got some great shots.  There are other animals but I didn't stick around to see them.  I was there for the panda.  Also getting there was easy.  Finding a taxi afterwards was challenging."
290,Place to feel happy!,"Our stop at the Macau Panda Pavilion was a very entertaining visit. From our hotel at the Cotai Central, we had to take a public bus - #25 or 26A. The panda park opens at 10 but make sure not to go there at 1300 as it closes for an hour.  We had to wait for the panda park to re-open at 1400.The ticket cost of MOP6 per person was a good price for the entertainment!  Watching the pandas eat and play was enjoyable as they were so cute to watch and observe. The place was well air-conditioned as well so it's a great stop to rest and relax."
291,Good for Kids to see really Giant Panda,"Only a short walk from my sister's and her family's complex. So glad I got to see the pandas even if they weren't very active. The kids loved it and especially as there's other animals in the park area. The pandas have their own enclosure and it cost 10mop ($2aud) for entry for 1 hour. It is also best to go on feeding times which I think are 11am and 3pm. The other animals don't cost anything and no time limit, there are monkeys, flamingos, birds, deers, ostriches and there is also a couple of kids playgrounds. Definitely one of my highlights in Macau"

293,Only if you never seen panda before,"Sadly one of the two resident pandas,  Xin Xin, died last summer, leaving us with just one panda, Kai Kai, at the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion.  This is unfortunate as pandas are very inactive. With two pandas, you had a much better chance of seeing at least one of them in action. Now with only one panda, odds are not great that you will see Kai Kai doing more than sleeping or laying around. Kai Kai has always seemed too lazy in our opinion. He is active when being fed so if you happen to visit at these times, you will see him moving around a bit. Otherwise, you are most likely going to see him just laying around, doing nothing.  We enjoy stopping by to see how he is doing (MOP10 for one hour). It is good way to spend 1/2 hour even if he is inactive, which is most of the time. During the winter months, they let him use an outdoor enclosure as well.  If you are interested to visit Kai Kai at the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion, this is a great opportunity to see a panda in a modern enclosure.  Just make sure your expectations are realistic when you visit and try not to feel disappointed if Kai Kai isn't doing much.  Note: For those planning to visit Hong Kong as well, you might prefer to visit Ocean Park, which now has a Panda Village where you can see a handful of pandas, providing a much improved chance of seeing pandas moving around and active."
294,worth the mission to get here!,"It was a bit of a Hike away from the main area of downtown and the Casinos.  We took a cab from the Wynn prob about 15-20min.  Don't go expecting a big zoo!! its is small and quiet and only has a handful of exhibits,  The day we went it was super empty, ghost town empty.  When we first got there all the pandas were sleeping and it was funny that  everyone was just sitting around in the panda building waiting for them to wake up.  They did eventually and it was super adorable!!"
295,Treat for the kids,"We stopped by during a day trip to Macau (from HK).  First of all, it was incredibly cheap to enter the pavilion (I think we paid the equivalent of $1.25 USD)!  For the great views we got of the pandas, this was a very good value.  The surrounding area (the rest of the ""zoo"") isn't much, looks very old and run-down, however the panda pavilion was in great shape, well taken care of and the pandas looked very relaxed and happy!  Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area; we probably spent about 45 minutes here."
296,More than just the panda,Rare animals and rare species.  Black and white in colour. Dits around the compound eating.  Food supply is bamboo.
297,Nothing special,"Good enough for me.  But getting there is hard, just had to keep pressing on till I got to that area. It is hard to find so get an english map with it listed."
298,Pandas missing,"Who knew?  This was an unexpected surprise.  A good friend of ours, who lives in Macau, took us around for a day.  We landed here and we had the best time.  The pandas were so interestingly funny.  If in town, then you have to head here in order to see the Pandas."
299,too small for keep animals,"We got lost on the way here. Turned the wrong way when we got off the bus, trekked more tha half way up the mountain before we realised our mistake. Came down again, went back to the bus stop, found ourselves in a very pleasant zoo/nature park.A short walk to the panda enclosure. You can only go in at certain times and can only go in when others come out. We were lucky and went in almost straight away.Pandas, two of them, lazing in the afternoon sun, in quite a large enclosure. Much more pleasant than when I lost saw pandas in a stinky zoo in Mainland China. We looked at them. They ignored us. After a while we had had enough and left them in peace.Loved the, They really are the cutest.Very informative exhibition in the pavilion next door, focussing on the birth of baby panders."
