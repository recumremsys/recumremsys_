1,"Great snapshot of the history, culture and nature of Khabarovsky Krai",Enjoy this place to learn Russian History.   Very helpful staff for non-Russian speakers.  I now understand the region and the history much better
2,Impressive collections,"This museum has so much in it, a complete history of the area.If you ever wanted to see birds and animals of the area, including the Amur tiger, mammoth bones and teeth - there are a million different stuffed ones to see.Loads of information on original inhabitants of the area including mock ups of their settlements, traditional dress, weapons and tools.The top floor is dedicated to conflicts.And... if you can read Russian, you'd be able to learn a lot."
3,Museum with a foreigner tax,"It is an excellent small museum in a historical building. Lighting is a bit dim for an old eyes and can improve on explanations.. No English no guide. Google translate. Display reminds me of the Victoria BC Canada's provincial museum,smaller. Excellent for family. Easy to walk to. It was very cold in Oct,snowed,too."
4,Very good,"History, culture and biology all in one package.  Top rated by visitors.  As always it helps to have a guide who speaks Russian to explain what you're seeing."
5,Interesting ,"This museum stretch on two buildings, and two floors well worth a visit.  So much to see from prehistoric times to present, and great information  about the tribes that inhabit the places.   There is a wide range of cultural, historical and ecological exhibits of the region. There is also a good geological section,  wide exhibition of stuffed animal in very good condition. Top floor is a painting montage depicting a famous civil war battle fought in the region. If only they could have signage in English. I fill missing part of the knowledge and it is very pity. After all it is not very complicated to print an English translation. All in all it is a must see attraction"
6,"Wonderful museum, but why no English translation?","Great place for far east Russian history. No english however. If you dont speak russian, bring along your dictionary tough."
7,Good Museum,"the kind I will always love.  This is a historical, a geological, a nature etc. museum.  I enjoyed the mammut, the wonderful wood-carving, the carpets..  Newest part is a exhibition about the Gulags who were at one time an important factor in this part of the world."
8,Residents are very proud of their museum ,The museum is geared for all ages.  I was there with my future grandchildren and they loved it as much as I did.
9,Bring a translator,"This is a great museum for anyone wishing to learn history of Russian Far East. They have exhibits ranging from natural history (see the remains of Amurozaurus) and ethnography, to history of Russian revolution in the Far East. Expect to spend several hours at the museum and do not forget to bring a camera. On the day we went, they a lot of activities for kids including painting and a play room. Overall a must see if you're in Khabarovsk.Here is a more formal quote from museum's website: ""The Khabarovsk Regional Museum was opened on the initiative of the Priamursky department of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in April, 19, 1894.    The museum has got the status of the scientific institution and is a member of the Russian Committee of the International Council of Museums (ICOM).    Nowadays the museum reserves contain more than 460 thousand items. Its expositions give information on the ancient history of the Priamurye, the unique nature of the Russian Far East, inhabitants of the Amur-River, history and culture of the region. Unique archeological, ethnographical, paleontological and historical collections are the basis of the expositions, which annually are visited by 180.000 people. """
10,"exceptionally good museum, definitely worth a visit",I think that better to watch out exhibition in new building.
11,OK...for a short walk through,Very detailed and well-kept artifacts and specimens of everything about this region — from geology to natural sciences and history. Highly recommended!
12,Interesting collection great display,"As a foreigner living in Russia, I have seen a lot of museums documenting both natural history and the history of the country. Unfortunately, the first category tend to be worn down and the latter to be unable to renew themselves for economical or ideological reasons. Not so in Khabarovsk. This museum starts with a great exhibition about the nature and environment of the region. Then it follows up with an up-to-date review of the region's modern history, with a lot of information and fascinating displays about the repression in the 30's, the thaw of the 60's and the havoc of the 90's. A guide is recommended if you can't read Russian. Do not pass by if you intend to visit any museum in the Russia Far east. 330 rubles for adults."
13,Learn the local history,"So much to see (from prehistoric times to present) but signage is only in Russian. The displays are well put together and the relics, artifacts and 'treasures' are worth seeing. Caveat: the old building is not accessible and there are many steps between floors. The new building is easier to navigate."
14,Very interesting exhibits,"It is a summer in the city. View from the one of the toppes buildings in the center of Khabarovsk. You can see the Amur river(Heilongjian in Chinese language). There are a lot of beautiful places in Khabarovsk ,especially in summer. In the year 2014 , the  bridge to a Bolshoi Ussurisky Island will be open, so the immigration control and custom service will be work in the 2014-2015. and you would be vizit China also..."
15,For the area and the distance from Moscow this museum was a wonderful day trip,"This place has so much to see, ranging from Russian history to indigenous people of far east to animals in the region. The entrance fee covers for both new and old buildings of the museum however they are not connected so you will have to walk out to the next building. We explore around in awe how big it was and the details of the items on display. Although the displays are not in English but we really enjoyed the experience. I definitely recommend everyone to go and visit the museum."
16,Lovely history about a part of Europe!,Was Ok..but less a museum than a collection of war stuff about USSR and not a lot about the ethnic or natural history of the area.
17,Great place to visit with kids,"The entry fee for foreigners is 100 rubles more than for Russians. There is currently an exhibit with carpets in one area, it is worth the entry fee all by itself."
18,A must see for the ones wanting to know something about the area,"Museum are okay but all instructions afre Russian language, thus hardly possible to learn details!!!???"
19,view from the top,My first to come to Russia and it was for a business trip. During my 7 day trip i had a chance to visit some museums and this is one of it. It’s interesting place. It’s kinda zoo but just that no living animals. You can take photos as much as you want. Many artifacts that you can learn from. A worth a visit.
20,Best in Khabarovsk,"My trip to far eastern russia has been more of a cultural investigation than anything else.This museum is a celebration of the rich history, Soviet, Chinese, Japanese and modern heritage of Khabarovsky Krai, and its wildlife exhibits in particular are very impressive.I also particularly enjoyed the fact that you can journey through various era of history and gain a view of how various elements of society, including indigenous Amur people such as the Nanai and Ussiri, have lived throughout.My only piece of constructive feedback is that i was somewhat incredulous why a higher price is charged for foreign nationals - given that i had a similar experience to what i would expect inhabitants of Khabarovsk to receive."
21,Must see in Khabarovsk,"Great regional museum. First floor has large display on indigenous peoples and flora and fauna as do most Russian regional museums.  Detailed sections on early exploration, negotiations with Chinese, settlement by Russians, Soviet era, and Russian Orthodox Church in the area. Lots of material on display - begs to be photographed.  Admission is 440 rubles (about $14.20) per adult, and go ahead and pay the 100 rubles (about $3.20) photography fee - you'll want to take photos."
22,Just unbeatable,"Full info about Khabarovsk region. History, nature and modern exposition.I like this museum. I invite you to KHV!"
23,Great museum for an uninteresting city,Along our Trans-Siberian Railroad route we were lucky enough to visit the Khabarovsk Regional Museum with our expert local guide who happily translated much of the museum for our English-speaking group. Really great to see.
24,Nice and big museum,"This museum has two buildings, and two floors. There is a wide range of cutlural, historical and ecological exhibits of the region. There is also a good geological section and two small gift shops. Definitely worth a visit. There might not be an english speaking guide"
25,Best natural and human history museum in Russia,"Well worth a visit with a wide range of exhibits covering all aspects of the Russian Far East from History, local culture to wildlife.  Need an English speaking guide as no English signage.  As a Geologist particularly liked the section on rocks and minerals found in the region.  On the top floor is a stunning 360 degree painting montage depicting a famous civil war battle fought in the region.  A must see attraction"
26,The main museum in the city,"The Regional Museum is located in teh Shevchenko St, fairly close to the ""foundational hill"" of the city and is hosted by a beautiful old red brick building (actually buildings). Admission is around 400 rubles for foreigners (around half for Russians). The exhibitions are really old, soviet style, no single piece of information in English. The route through the museum is somehow chaotic, as there are little indications and several rooms at different intermediate levels. Nonetheless, information is really interesting, ranging from local animals, lore, history, wars related to Khabarovsk (mainly WWII but also Sino-Russian wars, like the battle of Harbin, when Khabarovsk acted as army HQ), and common life through the soviet times. I really enjoyed it a lot. I do not give if 5* because of lack of English information and the need of renovation, cleaning and lighting in many exhibitions, but it is a must see in Khabarovsk, especially for those wanting to understand, learn and know more about the Russian Far East."
27,Old-fashioned real museum -,"We came from the U.S. to visit my family in Khabarovsk and I took my kids to this museum several times in July 2014. They loved it! My kids traveled all around the world, and visited so many places , so I was surprised how excited they got in this museum. They did not want to leave. I like that this place has educational exhibits (aquarium, animals), and also an awesome playground area. Everything was so clean and modern - not your old soviet museum. The museum staff was very nice too. This is my favorite place to visit in Khabarovsk!"
28,Nice place to visit,"Nice museum and good exhibitions: on Amur (flora, fauna, minerals), 70th anniversary of the Patriotic War, pictures of Valerij Shilyaeb ""Russian East from Amur to the Pacific Ocean"". In the old part of the museum was an exhibition on the native people in the region, natural history and local history (mostly Revolution, Lenin, Stalin)."
