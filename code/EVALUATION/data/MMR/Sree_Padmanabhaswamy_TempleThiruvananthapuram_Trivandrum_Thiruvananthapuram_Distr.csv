1,Divine ,"Temple has a rich heritage n history. Must visit place in Trivandrum.It has strict dress code for men n women. Must check before going.Huge serpentine queues would be waiting. Plan accordingly. Buy tinned prasadam for 200 Rs, it's handy if u r traveling further.Seeing the architecture was second best thing for me apart from darshan.No photography allowed. In fact no phones allowed. Carry a pouch with change currency for donations at many places."
2,A must-visit during Kerala trip,Padmanabhswamy temple is well known ancient temple of south India. It is historical and beautiful architectural legend of India. It has it's strict rituals  and you will not be allowed to go inside without wearing dhoti which is available out side on rent and on sale too. Temple‚Ä¶

4,Christmas vacation,One of the most popular temple in Kerala as well as in South India. This temple is located in large area. Temple fully covered  with security measures. Photographs are prohibited in some area.  A good temple with highly  spiritual energy.
5,My luck,"World famous temple, very beautyfull, god is vishnu, keralas very traditional temple, superb place ,,"
6,Beautiful temple,"Very good temple so many people from ll over india comes, inside the temple is very much maintained but the entrance looks very narrow ( not actually) "
7,Beautiful temple but poor management. ,This is one of the very old temple with its rich architecture and the its amazing to see huge stone pillars all around the temple. One has to admire the art and artisans who made it possible. The presiding Deity is very powerful and many sincere prayers gets answered. Its saddening to see it getting converted to a Tourist spot.
8,hari anant hari katha ananta - anantsayanam lord one and onlyDIVINE .WONDER,"One of the richest temple holding huge quantities of gold. This is revered and an old temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu called as Padmanaswamy in this temple.

9,A must visit for all,Landmark of trivandrum.... beautiful traditional and vry spiritual. Till date the temple follows the old age custom and rituals . You can go into the temple only in proper dress code. The one and only of this kind
10,Awe-inspiring experience ,"This is one of the oldest temples in Trivandrum. It is very famous and powerful. One must spend considerable time here to have a glimpse of all the important places like, the main deity sree Padmanabhan, darshan of all other deities inside, visit around the premises full of sculptures etcA crowded temple with limited darshan timings and dress codes.A visit to this temple will certainly make you satisfied, fulfilled and happy. Many poojas are available here to suit varied prayers of devotees.Definitely a must see temple and land mark in Trivandrum."
11,Must visit in Trivandrum,"A majestic temple built by travancore maharajas. Great architecture work. Must see once in life time. Padmanabha swamy to be viewed thro three gates one side head, middle portion and leg part"
12,Nice Experience,A very famous temple of Lord Vishnu and the idol is very big and brethtaking view. The dress code is very strict and any mobiles/smartwatches are not allowed inside temple premises. There are private rooms just outside the temple entrance for fresh-up or change dress. It's very rush when we visited and so took special entry ticket.
13,Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple,Really nice temple to visit still looks ancient inside and posture of Sree padma Swamy is must see. Don‚Äôt take more than 1000 rupees to be safe. Leave ur credit cards and wallet at safe place. Men should wear dhoti to enter temple and women must wear sarre or dhoti below‚Ä¶
14,Not very peaceful and inspiring experience,"The temple is probably the primary reason one would visit Trivandrum for. The temple is beautiful and it's a must visit for the religious ones. Others can also visit once for the experience.Do take care that you follow the dress code and the timings. Won't write much about it as it's well documented in other reviews. Do note that standard timings do not apply these days due to renovation work. Buy the premium entry tickets only if you see the place crowded.You can buy extra prasadam for friends and family after the darshan. It costs Rs. 80 per box. The dressing rules for women are a farce as we saw ladies in shorts/beach clothes being allowed entry by wrapping a near see-through dhoti, whereas traditional salwar suits and churidars are not allowed. Anyways, I won't get into the debate, it's just doesn't make mush sense to me.A note for non Hindus - you will not be allowed entry. :)"
15,WEARING DHOTI IS A MUST FOR MEN,It is a very old temple which to be visited. Near by two more place to visit. 1. Kuthiramalika and Chitralaya to bee seen .
16,Amazing,I glad that i visited this temple and admired beauty of dravidian architecture. When i visited this place it was less crowded. You have to buy dhoti from near by shops in price range from 40 to 50 to 150 because it is compulsory.   Odd thing i found there is that even after you‚Ä¶
17,Richest deity in the world...,"Sree padmaswamy temple is know as richest temple in Asia but I believe it's the most beautiful temple. Though cameras aren't allowed inside. There is a very beautiful sculpture of lord vishnu and lord narasimha. Lord Vishnu's sculpture is huge and made out of gold. This place reminds me of the old times.

There is a dress code too for women it is compulsory to wear saree though you can wear long skirts too and for men it's a bit strict they have to wear only dhotis with no shirts or vests."

They charged me Rs 100. We three changed our clothes and kept our belongings in that room ( under lock and key). It's safe and cheaper to other places (also cheaper than the govt authorised place)  , best part is that you don't have to stand in queue and in the crowd for keeping your belongings.

Source, Wikipedia which Trip Advisor does not allow me to provide a linkIt's a fantastic building but as it is a holy working temple, unless you are Hindu, you cannot enter. Still well worth a look though but don't take photos too near the temple, you will be in trouble with the police and numerous worshippers, pity no one explained that to me. Still, go visit!

The east side has a huge pond outside and is highly crowded whereas north gate is more quieter. It has an interesting story behind. Huge idol of Lord Vishnu in a sleeping pose.

Lord Vishnu is worshiped here as 'Ananthashayanan' i.e. reclining on the serpant Ananta. The massive idol can be seen through three different doors.

Three entrances to have dharshan of Thiruvadi, Thirunabi and Thirumugam. ‚Ä¶"
158,Devotional,There is no regulation in controlling the visitors to have the darshan of the swamy. There was a stampede in front of the sanctum sanctorum.  
159,Divine experience,"The Temple is very beautiful, spacious, beautiful architecture. But...When we entered the gate, some of the visitors were carrying shirts (not wearing). In a very rude and arrogant voice, the person at the gate shooed them away and told them that shirts are not allowed inside. Did not even guide as to where they could be kept. Mobiles are not allowed (which is fine).We got Rs. 250 tickets and were standing in the line (4th or 5th). At 5pm, the entrance opened for darshanam. And we went inside. At the same time from the side entrance, about 300 people, all from the north (apparently the governor's guests) just rushed inside creating chaos. They were just pushing and pulling each other and shouting. There was absolutely no crowd control. At the sanctum, the priests were shouting (never seen this in other temples in Kerala). There was no line - might was right. We just had a glimpse of the Lord and walked outside. And these 300 There is a Rs. 200 ticket, Rs. 250 ticket - the difference is an additional flower and a plastic bag. The east nada has steps to climb. The south does not. And there is a Boli and Chips shop (Maha Boli and Maha chips) near the East nada."
160,Intricate fusion architecture,My first visit to Padmanabhaswamy temple reminds me of in depth traditions being followed in hindu dharma right from the entrance. A auspicious day to have a close look of Sri Padmanabhaswamy and feel the power of almighty. One can find a serene and salubrious atmosphere inside‚Ä¶

164,Divine and peaceful place,"A temple to visit and experience spiritual and architecture. Must attend aarati. GOD is so enchanting and stunning with beauty. Butter applied to lord Hanuman doesn't melt or insects like ant etc doesn't infect. You must try prasad like panchamritam, aravani and Anna prasad. You must also see the clock installed above Palace near by. Worth watching every hour. Rgds sundaresh"
165,Lords Abode,"We went to this temple with my children. They have more restriction towards dressing to enter into temple. We can accept dhoti for adult but even for 10 year old son require to wear dhoti kind of material to enter into temple. Adult women are not allowed to wear chuidhar. They also supposed to cover up with short towel. I do not understand rational behind this restriction for women. In fact chuidhar is one of the best dress that cover up women fully. The temple is not that big compared to temples in Tamilnadu. The temple has nice walk path with sculptured pillars. When you are interested in watching sculpture, you can visit this temple. Unfortunately we could not do dharsan as temple was closed at 11:30 AM, will open only after 5 PM.You will face parking problem. You may need to park vehicle long back and walk."
166,Padmanabhasamy Temple,"One of the awesome experience of life time. Morning aarti and puja is really good, mahaprasadam I enjoyed."

After the Darshan go around the temples and see the glory of pandals and Kottaram which was constructed by the kings in old days. If time permits have afternoon food also inside the temple.

176,Temples of Kerala,A beautiful and ancient Hindu temple. Only hindus are allowed inside but as a non-Hindu you are allowed to walk around. No photography is allowed. Well worth a visit before entering the two Travancore museums. 
177,The best place in Thiruvananthapuram,1. Excellent Architecture of the temple.2. Good crowd management by temple trust.3. You can opt for only darshan at free of cost or take faster line and offer puja by buying a tickey at rs. 250.4. Dress code: saree for ladies but nowadays they allow you to rent a dhoti and put over your clothes.5. The temple gives  feeling of tranquiland is worth the visit
178,The primary reason for visiting Trivandrum,"Even if you cannot get in the temple, just the outdoor architecture deserves the trip. It is also ineteresting to walk around and check the atmosphere of this bustling area."
179,Must See This Temple,"Perhaps one of India‚Äôs cleanest and best maintained temples, the awesome temple has also a unique representation of Vishnu in resting pose. The sculpture can be viewed piecemeal through three doors. It was not crowded when I went to the temple but the male visitors do tend to‚Ä¶"

188,Land Mark Of Trivandrum,"Very calm atmosphere and the temple staffs having good behaviour, showing good respect to the visitors"
189,Impressive frontage!,"Visiting Padmanabhaswamy temple after 15 years, the most important change I could notice was the increased security and restrictions, even in the wee hours of the day. That said, the temple still has its charm. Managed to be on time for the Nirmalya Darishanam early in the morning (around 3.45 AM). Without doubt, this is the best time to visit the temple. There is not much of crowd. The rituals performed at this hour are special, and one can feel it only when one sees it. If you are visiting the temple, make sure you plan to visit at this hour for the pooja."
190,Traditional ,"Temple looks nice, but you may not take pictures near it. All arround the temple is a market, but the streets are full of dump everywhere. "
191,Limited,The temple is a fascinating place. It gives you the divine feel and the feel of full fillness.  A must place for all visitors
192,A must see in Trivandrum,AsUsual.Usually I went to Ganpathy  temaple by 6. 45 am for the  GANPATHY  KOOTU HOMAMUM pooja. From there to Sri Padmanbha temple  
193,Vacation ,One of the 108 Diviyadesam of lard Mahavishnu.. very well maintained clean and neat.we had a blissful and peaceful Dharshan thanks to the temple authorities for the great arrangements for the devotees
194,Heavily crowded,It is a place of Worship for Hindus. Not a tourist attraction. So Non-Hindus are not allowed inside. Quite understandable. Just admire the beauty from outside
195,Serene and tranquil...,"Sree Padmanabha Swamy is reincarnation of Lord Vishnu. This temple is strict in its rituals and mandated to abide by its rules. This temple is open only to Hindu pilgrimages. For gents, you need to wrap a dhoti and towel. Ladies need to wrap a neriyathu - The piece of cloth that‚Ä¶"
196,"An Old Temple, the major attraction in Thiruvanantpuram","Located right in the center of the city, it is an architectural marvel. Only tradition clothes are allowed and men cannot don shirts. If you do a guided tour you will be able to get the intricate details. Best time to visit is early morning."
197,Mesmerising !!,On 13 March we visited at padmanabhan swami temple.if I look back it gives ghoose bumbs as world was struggling with CARONA virus and we spotted in temple.no doubt no rush was there.it has opening timings we reached 7.20 pm n closing time was 7.20 pm.ine need to wear‚Ä¶
198,Neat & Clean Temple.,"Must visit for all, can‚Äôt explain how gud it is. Lot of effort by the king and his workers to built this iconic temple. Tons of rock were used to built this temple, will question our logic how they have built this with simple man power"
199,Wonderful and soulful place ,Wonderful experience to be able to visit the temple and being able to see and feel religious atmosphere only allowed to wear a Lungi white in colour and nothing else on the body security was very rigid hence you feel safe.Great Experience.
200,Famous temple in the area,"This is one of the most important Hindu temples of India.  Check timings on the website.  Men must wear dhoti and no shirt.  Women have to wear sari.  If wearing a salwar, a white dhoti should be worn over it.  There are no exceptions to this rule. If you do not have a dhoti, buy one from the shops outside the temple. There are cloak rooms outside where you can keep your belongings for a fee. Cell phones, cameras and all other electronic items are not allowed.  Better leave them in your car. No footwear (obviously). Free darshan is available.  If you dont have the time, a ticket of Rs. 250 (allows two persons) permits you to jump the queue and also you get to the see the deity from close quarters."
201,temple is nice with nice architecture,"The temple that gives Thirvananthapuram its name. The Lord is resplendent in his ""anantha sayanam"" and the temple is well maintained. One of the main attractions of the city"
202,Amazing Temple,"Very near to the city. Very strict dress code. Man cannot even take their tops in hand. Only dhoti allowed. Women are allowed only in Saris.  Need to cover with a mundu when in Churidhar.  The temple is divine and completely orthodox, religious and clod to heart. "
203,change in temple timing,i would suggest everyone to kindly hire a guide before darshan as the temple is big and you can only know its significance after knowing its history.fyi you can only wear unstitched clothes like dhoti for men and saree for women.You can buy the same at outside the temple for very cheap price. A must visit in trivandrum.
204,Peaceful and beautiful ,"A peaceful holy temple. Extra ordinary security measures which makes me more safe. A real holy divine place. The temple sorroundings and while premesies are clean and tidyA must visit temple for those who seek the blessing of God.Only problem is no specific parking area. The administration did some maintenance at the front side of the temple. Hence the temple became world famous after the inventions of the huge asset, the temple has more visitors then ever before. In considering that fact the administration must arrnage some parking area for the visitors."
205,Beautiful to look from outside. But non-hindus are not allowed inside !,positive Energy flow ever visited in my life thank God that I got the opportunity to visit this place.
206,Padmanabha Temple,"Visiting famous temples can be a daunting task in India , not here , take the 250 ticket and you will be done in a matter of minutes.Once you are in front of the deity there are three doors , the first door you will be able to see the hands of the God , you have to really pay attention to be able to see the face , I had to take a 2nd visit to be able to see that.The idea is black and the sanctum sanctorum is dim , so pay attention to see all its glory."
207,Peaceful abode,"This is a magnificent structure and very popular, but only Hindus are allowed into the temple itself. We had a tour of the outside of the temple which was interesting but we would have preferred to enter."
208,Busy Hindu Temple,We visited the temple when the Shabarimala festival was in progress. The ambience was very peaceful. Everything was very orderly. A must visit for the faithful.
209,Very poor and greedy management,"We visited the Padmanabhaswamy temple early in the morning. We had a great darshan of the deity. The temple is awesome for its structure, design, architecture and sculptures. The architecture of the temple, especially the stone and wooden architecture are very rare and historic. I feel it is a must visit for all those who visit Kerala."
210,Sree Padmanabha swami temple,Lovely place. Friendly people. Women need to wear either saree or lungi and men need to be bare chested and compulsory lungi. There is no entry fee but can get special darshan with fee of 150/-
211,Heaven in earth...,"It's great to have been there. Every gents need to wear dhoti while been in temple and ladies having dhotis have no problems but if they wear salwar, jeans need to take dhoti and wear it. There is arrangements of dhoti near the temple and locker rooms are there to keep your‚Ä¶"
212,A pious experience ,"Initially we learnt that we need to go in dhoti and saree. When I reached there, I was asked to take shirt out, but leather purse was allowed. Entrance is magnificent. Not too many people, still a lots of commotion near main temple. Hipocratical brahminical practice allowing purse to buy ticket for pooja. If you did not buy ticket, they would not allow to pray for more than few seconds. Shouting put put. Amazing temple run poorly."
213,Lovely temple,"When one thinks about a trip to Trivandrum, the first thing that comes to mind is the renowned Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. Touted as one of the richest temples in India, this temple is second to no other temple in attracting devotees world-wide. The temple houses an idol of Lord Vishnu in a sleeping posture, reclining on the serpent Anantha or Adi Sesha with five hoods facing inwards. The consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi are on the sides of the Lord. Offering prayers to Vishnu at this temple kindles the spirit of each devotee bringing in miraculous changes in their thoughts and feelings. The temple has gained attention especially in recent years due to its mysterious secret vault, the door for which is believed that no human or technology can open, defying which may result in havoc or catastrophy.  This is one of the very few temples with suggested dress codes for men and women. For those visiting the temple with no prior knowledge about the dress code, there are help centers just outside the temple entrance to rent dhotis, wearing which they will be allowed to enter the temple."
214,Visit to the world richest shrine,the temple is closed at 9.15 am now due to ongoing construction work.they open at 5 pm only. pls.plan visit accorsingly
215,Divine Experience,The custodians of certain temples in India believe that the the so called Gods resident in these temples are only menat for 'Hindus'. How do they know that the people entering are Hindus? By insisting that they wear certain kinds of garb which represent being a Hindu! The juvenile and ignorant minds of these so called custodians is not just sad but laughable. It is best to stay away from such places. God would never be present in such places.
216,A complete spiritual experience.,"If you visit Kovalam, do not miss the opportunity to visit the temple. We did the Darshan during the evening. It was beautifully lit. Men/ Boys must wear Dhoti and may optionally cover their upper body with a dupatta. Women/ Girls have to either wear Saari or if wearing salwar‚Ä¶"
217,An interesting place..,"A must visit place. Entry restricted to Hindus. The darshan of the lord is through 3 doors as the deity is huge. Lord Padmanabha is in reclining position. Don't expect to have a glimpse of the treasures of the temple. It's all safely locked up. The intricate carvings in the temple is worth the time. There is a saptaswara mandapa inside, where each pillar will give you Saregama notes if you can percussion it right. Thursday is a rush day."
218,Divine,No male person is allowed to enter the Padmanabh Swami temple with full clothes.Males have to buy Dhoti from the shops there & wear below waist and be bare chested.Females can wrap Dhoti over their cloths.There is a ticket of Rs. 250 for those who want to avoid long queue.Absolutely serene place.
219,Lord Vishnu Temple,"Not just gents who need to wear only dhoti to enter temple, even we Ladies wearing trousers or jeans had to drape a dhoti to enter temple. One of the oldest temples of south India. We had been here during morning prayer time. Temple can be reached by local auto. Local market is‚Ä¶"
220,Temple visit,Entering the Temple is restricted to Hindus in proper dress. The area is busy. There are souvenir sellers. The tower is nicely decorated.
221,Tips for an easy visit to the impressive temple,"The temple is so beautiful during day or at night. One can really experience the aura of spirituality the second you enter the temple premises. It's a must to follow dress code which is saree for women and dhoti for men. Inorder for people not to be disappointed, the temple sells dhoti for 50rs so that can be worn as mund by women if they are wearing anything other than saree or long skirt. The paal payasam is my favorites which is given as Prasad if you order one day in advance. The temple has a good locker facility as no electronics are allowed inside temple. The security can be a bit strict that they will not let u wear any smart watches. Make sure to leave everything except you wallet at the cloak room so you can have a peaceful darshan. There is a long queue if you are visiting the temple on an auspicious occasion. It's crowded and there will be people flooding from all directions without following the queue and it's something that can't do anything about. It's better to just stay calm as you will be the last person to have a great darshan if you wait patiently admist the crowd. Last but not the least make sure to stop by the famous clock which is said to have been installed in the 1840s during the reign of Maharaja¬†Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. The clock still works perfectly, and strikes each hour in a day. Don't miss it."
222,Its a Hindu temple,"Every temple has its own rules so do Sree Padmanabha temple as well. Dress code!Dothi/ veshti/ mundu - is allowed for men without a shirt or t-shirt.  So men who all are planning to enter the temple with pants and shorts have to buy or rent a dothi or mundu.For women - saree, skirts are allowed. If you are wearing a churidar, there is a place nearby where you can buy or rent the dothi and wear on top of the churidar pants.Beautiful architect, there are boards everywhere giving the history of the temple and how it is constructed. Do not miss the saptaswara mandapa...where you can hear the music inside the pillar. Speechless every time I visit this place."
223,Divine experience; must visit for Hindus,"Place is divine , need to be careful about what u wear. For ladies it's sari for men it's  dhothi ..."
224,Very worth to visit Padmanabhaswamy temple,Temples now a days are a form of business and this temple is not an exception to that. You are made to shell out money to take darshan properly and fictitious waiting time and what not. If you are going as devotee then it's ok otherwise can be viewed from outside only
225,Reasonably impressive but not allowed inside,we went on a weekday hence less crowded . Had the luxury of availing darshan of lord Padmanabhaswamy 2 times.  the total surrounding is maintained neat&clean.  For gents dhoti & angawasthiram is compulsory and for ladies it is saree.  Be sure to carry because this is a standard requirement for all temples in Kerala.  It is also available at the entrance of the temple for a price of Rs 100/-
226,Visit to temple on My daughters birthday,The temple is stunning and worth a visit. It evokes a feeling of being blessed.  The rules for entering the temple must be relaxed. We had to wrap a mundu (dhoti) around us.
227,Padmanabh Swami temple,Visited the temple with my family last week. I have to agree it is a beautiful temple not to be missed. Strict dress codes before entering the temple so please observe to avoid unnecessary stress otherwise there are dothi's available for rental. Police presence are everywhere‚Ä¶
228,Historic temple and the Richest,"On a trip to ribavirin it is worth a visit. 2500 years old. However, visitors are not allowed inside"
229,An outstanding heritage,"You can enter the divine temple in a dhoti only and are available at the entrance,in case you don't have one,and ladies can enter in a sarree only.Once this is done you deposit all your belongings,clothes shoes,watch etc,on a small charge.there is an entrance fee if Rs.250 .The vastness of the temple engulf you,there is a massive idol about 6 metered plus long in which the deity is lying on the bed of Sheshnag,the lighting inside is only by oiled diyas and you gave to really glare your eyes to see the gold moorti and understand what the pujari tells you.A big hand under which a shiv ling is there and then second half the Brahama is on top of the navel suspended from no where and the final door gives you the glimpse of the feet and all your devotion is answered by an unknown blessings on the way.Filled with a huge crowd of devotees who flock to seek blessings you feel marvelled at the structure of the same and a new gate being erected in a manner of such immense and intricate details of the carvings done on it.Do visit and seek blessings."
230,Must visit temple in Trivandrum,"We were late in reaching the temple and there was a big queue. The volunteer suggested us to pay 250 rupees and get a ticket for VIP pass. It included a lotus flower and fruits for offering to God. It also includes a can of prasad (like Tirupati). Also, this allows you to the innermost line of devotees and one is able to view the face of Lord clearly (the sanctum sanctorum is dark and lit by oil lamps only."
231,Spiritual Place,I am grateful for this visit. Darshan were hustle free. No rush and I got to absorb the whole place with no pushing around. Dress code to be followed but not to worry as the temple has a shop to buy the allowed dress code. No harm in buying the traditional stuff from shop.‚Ä¶
232,Great ancient temple,"You can visit the area but Indians can only enter into the temple, they must wear a dothy  Foreigners are permitted to view the surroundings from outside "
233,Nice from the outside,we went in the evening wether was nice we were guided nicely about where to get in where to deposit our cellphone even inside the temple volunteers were very helpfull in guiding
234,Holy place,"A massive, well maintained, highly divine Temple - one of the 108 Divyadesams for Sri Vaishnavas. Located centrally this Temple can be reached within 15 minutes from Airport, 5 minutes from Station. Male members should only use dhoti and Female members with sarees or decent Indian dress. Very organised queue system offers Darshan of Lord Padmanabha Swamy in 20-30 minutes. Entire Temple gives us a highly spiritual aura and a sense of great satisfaction after darshan. Must see for all."
235,Nice place to see evening life,"You will get this place in google when you search for the riches temple in the world. But the more the mystery and the aura when we know the fact that all that gold lay hidden under us, all these years. Still there will not be any trace of Gold in front of your eyes except the idol of Vishnu in a sleeping position. You have to personally scratch the grime out of the statue to understand that its made of Gold, which again is not allowed. But trust me it is made of pure Gold and the saga behind the temple and the statue and the mythical powers are enough to goad us to the centre of its mysteries. The structure is a fusion of Tamil and Kerala Sculpturing and craftsmanship. The famous Goat headed clock and the padmatheertha Pond adds sparkles to the mystery that will surround us.All these spiritual mysteries lies right next to a bustling city and a street covered with vendors selling everything you want to take back from Trivandrum.Truly wonderful and spiritual experience."
236,Historical and Architectural Marveel,"We didn't get in the temple, we just saw it from the outside. Like in many other temples in India, you're asked to leave all your possessions outside, including cellphones and cameras. From the outside, it doesn't look too impressive."
237,Great temple ,"Awesome peace for mind and heart, beautiful structure, incredible power in the temple just close your eyes and feel blessed."
238,Beautiful temple,The dress code for this temple is strict-dhoti for all men-Saree or long skirt for all womenEven kids below 5 years also have to follow the dress code.My daughter was wearing a frock and they did not allow her.We reached around 10:30 am and went to the south door directly to avoid queue and took ticket for darshan as the temple was about to close within an hour. The time to buy dhoti and wear it took a lot of time for us. Hence I would suggest whoever going to visit the temple carry one dhoti for each in order to avoid last minute bargaining with the local shops.Inside temple the Vishnu darshan went well and we were also given one prasad dabba as part of the ticket. There was also free prasad( kerala style) available.
239,Divine temple with awsome darshan,"It's a heritage temple,few things to keep in mind,1.entry to temple is allowed only wearing saree and dhothi  2. Visit early morning to avoid rush3.mens with shirt not allowed below portion with dhothi and upper body naked even towel type cloth is also not allowed however you can deposit ur shirt before entering temple with 5 rs to local shops 4.photography is not allowed in temple however it can be taken outside 5 . preferably if you can keep your wallet and mobile in vechile before going to temple,only take sufficient money required6.you can keep your shoes outside temple to local shops 7.purchase suvinors from outside temple with low priceVisit temple once in lifetime to have amazing experience of rich cultural heritage of India ,it's really interesting to see god with gold dressing in all time s"
240,What a spiritual feel at the temple pooja,Wonderful experience seeing the beautiful padmanabha swamy temple.By the time we reached the darshan time was over.So couldn't enter.
241,Holy vishnu darshan no,The Temple stands out for Divinity. One can feel the vibrations inside. One should ensure proper dress code while visiting and also better to check with Temple timings before planning...
242,will not recommend this place,The experience of the padmanabha swamy temple is absolutely mind blowing. Serene and quiet and clean.
243,Must visit... Completely divine..,Such a beautiful temple. My second time there. There is a strong vibration at this temple. A must visit temple in Trivandrum. 
244,Positive Energy flow,"The approach to the main gate of temple has been spruced up in recent years, the temple tank sparkling clean, the temple tower beautifully lit up. It has however become both a pilgrim destination and a tourist spot. If you wish to feel the peace, spend a few minutes on the sand‚Ä¶"
245,Blessed day@ temple,Too Divine and Godly place to visit. Do not miss this place. I really feel like visiting once again. Hope Sree Padmanabhaswamy accepts my wish.
246,Racist and unfriendly staff,"Grand temple with many photographic angles.  Unfortunately, no access unless you‚Äôre a Hindu.  Certainly worth a stroll around it just for the pics!"
247,"Jai Govinda, a place to visit.","I remember I went here very long back. To my knowledge, this is the only temple where you can find the lord vishnu in lying position. Did not see or hear about any other place in India about such a deity. There were strict dress codes for people to enter inside. Better to check‚Ä¶"
248,Magnificent Rich Temple,Good architecture. A peaceful place. Dress code is there.  You can't wear churidar or jeans.  Mundu is available outside.  Behaviour of security personnel is neither friendly nor professional. 
249,A huge place depicting Culture,"Truly one of the most architecturally outstanding temples in South India. For those intending to visit, I would highlight a few things that are different from other temples in Kerala that we visited and may be useful to know - 1. No smart watches are allowed in the temple‚Ä¶"
250,PADMANABHSWAMY  god present in form,"Its nice when everybody is treated alike in spite of varieties of culture and religion , No one is exempt from any of their rules,or services. One should visit in a life time all the famous holy centers to know the culture."
251,loved the architecture..,"I would always experience the divine feel during my early morning 4am visit to the temple. As many Nirth Indians are visiting this temple as part of their rameswaram kanyakumari package, enough information in Hindi should be displayed at entrances to knew about temple traditions, dress code, timings etc.,About 90% of first time visitors are not satisfied with feel of complete darshan due to unawareness, is my observation. The best time to see temple is either at 4am or at 6:30pm."
252,"Nice Temple, not so nice surrounding ",Arrogant temple priests like vultures after money and trying to sell their stuffs. They make their own laws and not respect people coming genuinely to offer prayer
253,No Access Unless You‚Äôre A Hindu,The calm and quite enviornment made the Darshan satisfying. The systemetic arrangement in offering prayer is exemplary.The sebayats(Pandits) are cooperative.
254,Nice Temple,"Sree Padmanabhaswamy templeSree Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu located in Thiruvananthapuram, India. The shrine is currently run by a trust headed by the royal family of Travancore. The Maharajahs of Travancore are Cheras and descendants of the great saint Kulashekhara AlwarReplica:-The Temple is a replica of the famous Sri Adikesavaperumal Temple at Thiruvattar. Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple gave its name to Kerala‚Äôs state capital - Thiruvananthapuram. Among other things, the temple is famous for having a secret vault that no human can ever open easily. Let us now revisit the history of the temple and learn more about the mysterious door.Sleeping posture:-The principal deity, Padmanabhaswamy, is enshrined in the ""Anantha-sayanam"" posture (in the eternal sleep of Yoga-nidra on the serpent Anantha). The Maharajah of Travancore bears the title, ""Sree Padmanabhadasa‚Äô (Servant of Lord Padmanabha)."
255,Must visit if you are a Devotee,Strict dress code in place. Was happy about that. Devoutness is a plus factor. The temple reflection in the water is beautiful.
256,Beautiful temple ,Visited with Family. There are 2 or 3 different lines/Que's  entering the Security checkpoint before entering the temple. Security at this gate is more concerned with checking if you are wearing the correct Indian outfit and not at all bothered with actually doing any security check. Perhaps the security is in business with the various shops in front of temple renting selling traditional outfits which is a must to wear when entering this temple. Most ladies had just some sort of sheet wrapped over Their clothes and it was ok. Once inside the queue moves fast. The entrance to the shrine is very narrow.  people just shove and push each other trying to get inside.  This entry could be better organised. Absolutely no rush once inside the shrine area and you can have a good view of the Lord. Very peaceful atmosphere inside the vast temple premises.
257,Holy Visit ,"Located near the city centre, the temple offers a surreal experience as you enter the premises. The temple was lit only by diyas - no artificial lighting. The sight of MahaVishnu resting on AnantSesha is a sight to behold. Men need to wear lungi only whereas women have the flexibility of wrapping a saree over the dress."
258,Wonderful Experience,"Non - Hindus are not allowed inside this temple, so we just gazed at the intricate stonework of the entrance. The stonework looks as though it has been painstakingly cleaned back to the original condition. Of more interest is the wooden palace, the entrance to which is in front‚Ä¶"
259,Devine Experience,"My wife and I visited the temple and wanted to go inside. First they told us to bring our bag to storage, we did that. The. They told us that foreigners are not allowed which meant my wife but I couldn't. They told us to go to West gate and we could enter there. So we walked‚Ä¶"
260,Aarattu at Padmanabha swamy temple is worth seeing.,This is the worst temple I have ever been in. The openly say no to foreigners and have the staff has an audacity to tell them to go to the PR office and they will decide if you are worthy to visit. This temple has all the attributes of a rich snob.
261,The Padmanabhaswamy temple,"This ancient temple is certainly an essential visit. Please do note that ladies have to wear a saree and the gentlemen have to wear a dhoti to be allowed entry. However, this can be bought outside the temple. Inside there may be a lot of rush but still it would take about 40-50‚Ä¶"
262,Please carry dhoti for all members if you plan to visit this temple,"It is so beautiful and majestic, did not imagine it will be so so beautiful ....one could see each block so clearly; "
263,Visit to Trivendrum,Just drove by to have a glimpse of the temple and surrounding. A busy city with heavy traffic and plenty of shops and malls. It is much busier near the temple with very strict traffic control. You could see Police patrol and traffic controller.  Had a quick check out from the‚Ä¶
264,Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple,Men need to wear dhoti & women have to wear sarees. Both are available on rent just outside the temple.
265,It was a spiritual trip,"Lots to do even if you are not allowed into the Temple itself. A museum housed in a section of an old palace, the ""Methan Mani"" clock, the reflection of the setting sun on the Temple pond, and the general hustle and bustle of pilgrims and hawkers is a great pastime around 6:00pm."
266,divine feeling,Dress code is compulsory for man with dhoti and no upper cloths.women should wear Saree or long skirt.if these dress is not possible to wear then buy dhoti and wrapped over it which is guided by temple official. There is special entry darshan  which cost 250 and see good from‚Ä¶
267,"Padmanabhaswamy temple, Trivandrum ",Once in a lifetime experience....must visit to experience the soul of the Divine Place and receive the blessings of just being there....no words can explain the experience
268,Awesome experience ,We took the special darshan thali for 250 per couple. I felt they could have done a better job in managing the queue. People from the general queue were also pouring into the special darshan queue. More than praying I was looking to come out from that body sticking crowd!! Temple premises is well maintained and clean . Dress code for ladies to be in skirts or sarees and for men it‚Äôs only dhoti . Very strict checking. Ensure you keep cables cans lotions everything in the cloakroom along with phones
269,Great temple,"Very impressive from the outside.  As a foreigner & non-Hindu I was not allowed inside, as entrance is strictly controlled by the brahmins. Lots of people making their pilgrimage - men in simple white dhotis, women in colourful saris. Surrounded by lots of shops/ stalls,‚Ä¶"
270,It was an experience to be remembered forever,Ensure that you wear doti for men without anything on top. Women should wear sari and pavadai and top for kids. The temple still maintains the tradition. The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu as Padmanabaswamy. Please stick to timings mentioned in the temple and do not carry mobiles and any accessories. Please store it in vlock room.
271,Simply great,i was asked to remove my shirt and ware a vetti .i have to buy one separate electronics and keep them at one counter and  I have to pay for it as well.I ask ask to remove my trouser at the entrance.because I was warering vetti over my trouser.Swamy at the entrance who body check at the entrance was very rude.This is the only temple I have seen guard by army with T 56 weapons.I did not go inside because as a guest of India I was very upset.
272,Divine experience,It‚Äôs a must to wear dhoti and shirtless for men . It‚Äôs a must visit place . The temple has some strict timings so please see the timings before you‚Äôll go .
273,Easy visit,Before going to temple you have to know about the timings. No Jeans Trousers Shirt Tshirt Mobile Camera watch is allowed in the temple. U can also go for special Darshan. Rs 200 for 2 person by this u can see the idol very closely. U have to wear Dhoti to enter the temple.
274,Must be visited,If you reach temple before 4:45 you can have the first darshan. Otherwise we will see the next darshan at 6;30. Women wear saree or skirt and men dhoti. Entering through East gate is the right thing to do. Either free darshan or special entrance with Archana and prasadam for‚Ä¶
275,Darshan,"Attire/Dress code: You need to have a Dhoti/mundu to enter the temple as a male. Gents need to take off shirt or banians. Ladies with sarees can go in, but ones with Churidars or jeans need to drape a mundu/Dhoti above it. So bring one with you if you dont want to pay to buy a‚Ä¶"
276,Divine and spiritual ,Its always a lovely experience but those who don't want to battle crowds or brave long queues can attend the mangal arati in the wee hours of the morning!
277,Divine Experience,Gents can only wear a veshti (White or off white) and go there. Ladies need to wrap a veshi over the Salwar Suit or Jeans.. Best if someone stands outside with your stuff while you go in.. The lockers facility is good and relaibel.
278,Serene and Spiritual,"We reached early in the morning at the temple on the first day of our Kerala tour but had about an hour‚Äôs wait till the next darshan at 6.30am. We walked around inside the magnificent temple complex, sat quietly till about 6.15am, when we joined the queue. We watched different rituals performed by the priests and watched regular devotees visit to offer their prayers before we went in for our ‚ÄòDarshana‚Äô. We came out feeling elated as well as humbled by what we experienced!"
279,Fantastic Temple,"A peaceful temple to explore but please keep your electronics items (including smart watch, phone cables) in your hotel room if you are visiting this temple. Or else you can keep them at the counter provided for a fee. Bring vesthi/dhoti if you are wearing kurtis or you can get a veshti for INR 65 rupees at the entrance."
280,Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple,Shree Padhmanabhaswamy Temple in Trivandrum now known as Thiruvananthapuram is a main Pilgrim Centre in Kerala and is one of the 108 Divyadesams for Vaishnavas. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the indigenous Kerala style and the  Kovil style  of architecture‚Ä¶
281,Spritual and peace ful,"We were lucky enough to be at the temple when the festival of light was taking place - it occurs every 6 years. The temple was lit from top to bottom and was beautiful at night. The atmosphere was great, the people were all extremely friendly. The show on the eve of the festival, which is held around the water at the front of the temple, was excellent. It was quite a spectacle and we got a birds eye view from a nearby building and the locals were keen to ensure we all got to see what was going on. You cannot access inside the temple unless you are a Hindu but the exterior of the building alone is certainly worth the visit."
282,Nice Temple,"Restrctions of wearing dhiti and removing shirts and banians though a old custom and tradition, unnecessarily brings god in between with man made rules. otherwise the temple is huge with great grandeur.It is huge also."
283,Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple Trivandrum,"Non hindu's cant get anywhere near it, no point going, and you can only look from away. Go elsewhere."
284,Interesting for Temple Lover who like to visit temple at tourist place,"The Supreme Principal Deity¬†Para brahman,¬†Maha Vishnu/Adi Narayana¬†is enshrined in the ""Anantha Shayanam"" posture, the eternal¬†yogic sleep¬†on the¬†serpent Adisheshan.  The dress code is very strictly followed Dothi is must for gents  Saree is most preferable for ladies or else‚Ä¶"
285,A anciet temple,"1) east nada / north nada 2  gate.  north les crowd.  2) male-strict dress code- bare chest + mundu(dhoti -)female  saree/MUNDU  is alowed JEANS-NO.drape mundu on salwar.skirt 3)nirmalya darsanam-(PUREst form  IDOL) at 3am,, entry at 3.30.- darsan till  4.45 am) stand in corner.‚Ä¶"
286,What an amazing temple to visit.,we spent couple of hours just observing devotees lining up to pray and partake in religious activities
287,great,Gents- You must  wear vesti and no shirts  saree/ vesti & shawl - for ladies ( simply the reflection of hindu custom)  
288,Temple visit ,A serene and peaceful place where you can spend some quality time away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The temple itself is beautifully built and the architecture is appreciable. You will feel the presence of the supreme power right by your side.  The only thing which is‚Ä¶
289,My view,Remain calm dont ever rush . Truly a Gem of its kind of temple. And dont miss the early morning darshan which is around 3.30 am 
290,Awesome Temple,"Divine. Abolsutely divine. The rush was too much, but had a great darshan thanks to a friend. They have maintained it very well."
291,Divine.,"But for non-Hindus like us, well, we were denied entry, and as such got to look at a somewhat unimpressive temple from a distance. I understand that inside is amazing, and either way, if you are in the city you will visit here, but white people: manage your expectations.If you have made the effort to get here and feel disappointed, at least spend the few dollars and go visit the palace next door."
292,Pride of kerala,Looks great from the outside but anyone looking foreign is not allowed in. No explanation- just a no. Quite disappointing.
293,Ladies wearing trousers or jeans need to drape a dhoti to enter temple,"My 3rd visit to the city and the Very 1st to the temple, and it did not disappoint. The attire for men and women is easily available at the temple, and not a hassle at all. The expansive layout, cleanliness and helpfulness of the temple folks was definitely welcoming. There are‚Ä¶"
294,Nice Temple need to visit ,"Though outwardly ornate, we refused to go in. I accept that there has to be a dress code but this was so prescriptive that you were forced to buy garments to wear. What's worse, although it was ""free"" entry, you had to pay to see the statues. The final insult came when my white husband (who lives by Hindu traditions) wasn't allowed in simply because he is white! SUCH OPEN PREJUDICE. HINDUISM IS A WAY OF LIFE AND DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE."
295,GREAT TEMPLE,I visited this place twice. Once during the day and once in the late afternoon when the night starts. Both time it was very nice just to be there and watch people commig for prayers. In the evening/late afternoon was more crows dan it is nice to see the temple with some lights. I am non hindu so could not go in..but still i liked it.
296,Divine,Visited the temple with great anticipation but must admit the overall experience left me a bit dejected.  1. No clear signboards for visitors 2. Special darshan tickets are sold at multiple counters but the volunteers were steering all to a single windo 3. Extremely slow moving‚Ä¶
297,Holy place,Holy placeTo much crowdedMorning 3.40 am is best timeOr 8.30 amPalpayasam is lords favourite offering
298,Divine place,"Which sort of ended that.   I had my lungi on, shirt off - even had the round stomach that most others had - I just wasn‚Äôt Indian enough.   Clearly it‚Äôs not about your religion  - it‚Äôs about colour of skin.  (This is the police outside - nothing to do with the temple ).  They‚Ä¶"
299,Holy,"If you don‚Äôt mind humiliation and few pushes and scolding, you may go to this place. I was terrified at seeing a guard pushing a small girl off the queue. Pathetic state indeed."
