The architecture is wonderful and maintained well.The historical places with great views and beautiful garden outside and tiger statue.one government Store is also their, do buy whatever you want. You really get sandal items in cheap price as compare to other store in city.Note that washroom facility also available, so no worry."
1,"""Most Beautiful Palace""","It is the most important place to visit in Mysore as I understand. The architecture and artwork speak volumes about the mastery in  construction and love of art in the royal family.I have been there once as a kid and now 4 times in the last 5 years as I now live in Bengaluru and Mysore is the best place to visit unplanned when you have guests who want to see around. The palace is very crowded on weekends (all of my earlier trips were on weekend), so if you have an option to visit on a weekday, please do it. On our last trip, which was on a Friday, we got a view of the palace like never before as there were very few visitors."
2,Historical and beautiful ,"The palace was spectacular and very interesting to walk the halls. Great artwork abounds, along with very elaborate rooms. We had a guide who was very insightful and provided additional history to us. A must see in Mysuru."
3,Wonderful Architecture and Interesting Visit,"Most beautiful place. Too much crowded, go with family & friends.The architecture is wonderful.This is one of the historical places with great views and beautiful garden outside and inside washroom facilities available for all. Most attraction place in Mysore."
4,Spectacular Palace,The palace is good and worth a visit. However I felt that some areas are neglected and not maintained well. Although the palace is more than 100 years old some areas can be improved. Can be visited once.
5,Mysore Palace,"Well, it is indeed a beautiful palace. I loved the colours used in every corner of it. It is really well-maintained in spite of the huge crowd. But the lighting in some parts could be better as it was too dark."
6,Beautiful Indian heritage,"A place like this needs no mentioning. The interiors are so well maintained and from the outside, the Palace stands worthy of a national wonder. This is one of the underrated places despite its existing popularity and should be on the lines of Taj Mahal or better."
7,Amba vilas palace,The view is excellent. Very well maintained. Amongst the best palaces in India. When lit it looks very grand.
8,stunning,A real Wow. Beautiful building and very interesting. Lots to see and the grounds are lovely too.Lots of visitors there but do not rush your visit. Hang back until the groups have passed to get great photos
9,Night or day,"Must see place in Mysore. The Palace is mind blowing. Illumination/ Lighting is excellent at night. In my opinion, one of the best Palaces in India."
10,Imagine the riches of the maharajah of Mysore!,We visited the palace along with family and friends. We hired a guide. The palace is very beautiful with intricate designs. The colours used are a sight to see. The walls are lined with beautiful paintings and cultural traditions of coronation and festivals. Very enriching history.
11,Rich heritage,This palace is beautiful and highly decorative. A real gem beautifully maintained. With a guide you can appreciate the history behind it.
12,Gilded glory,"This is a beautiful place in Mysuru  South India The palace your takes you around the gardens , the rooms, the Durbar halls where the kind used to hold his sessions, the clothes and jewellery they used to wear The weapons The intricate designs on personal belongings Artifacts collected by them and a few presents given by a few kings and queens of yesteryears"
13,Osam,"Beautiful palace, a must visit in the city of Mysuru. The city itself is very calm. The only concern is the administration is not looking after it as a heritage property. THERE were crowds of people allowed inside the palace when we visited. When it is a heritage property, the administration needs to regulate the foot traffic."
14,"amazinfg palace, worth the drive from Bangalore","The Palace is an impressive place to visit during the day. The Architecture is superb and there is many items to see especially the paintings with faces that follow you. On Sunday nights the palace is adorned with 1,000s of bright lights making it a real spectacle."
15,Worth a Trip to Mysore Just for this Palace,I visited this palace with my wife recently. Really it was very huge palace. We found too much crowd and howevev the security personnel control the crowd nicely. It was rebuilt 125 years ago. We saw the Darbar Hall and the gallery . Very well designed . It is also a must see place in Mysore.
16,Impressive inside and out,"Very unique experience. The palace is huge and the courtyard is awesome. Inside you will get a chance to get some royal clicks. The only turn off was that you got to remove your shoes before entering, and it rained so it was all wet and muddy."
17,Beautiful palace,"Recently visited here with friends. Magnificent and well maintained  place with picturesque historic importance! One could truly enjoy the experience of visit, that would take back to its glorious history. Must visit place if you happen to be in Mysore or around."
18,Light switch on not to be misses ,The beautiful palace is just pEyes pleasing to watch. A heritage worth spending time here. Just amazing
19,Beautiful architecture,Mysuru palace is like no other. Absolutely stunning and well kept this tells story of wealthy and rich culture and life of wodiyar rulers
20,Must visit while in Mysuru,The palace is just beautiful. What luxury. Beautiful halls   the interior is just stunning. A truly beautiful place
21,Very interesting palace,The Mysore Palace is a must see for every visitor to the city. It’s well maintained and I particularly enjoyed the family portraits. Some of the paintings were originals by Raja Ravi Varma! The whole tour will take approximately 1 hour since only a small portion of the palace is open to public. Try going on a weekday as early as possible to avoid crowd.
22,Beautiful palace,"Travelled with family.  It’s nice to see the place with wonderful interiors and painting. It’s better with good tour guide as it would be interesting to know what Kings life style instead of looking at on your own. This palace is well maintained.  The paintings and wood carved doors are wonderful. There is a huge parking lot near palace entrance without any parking charges.  TIPS: There is a direct Karnataka government Cauvery showroom inside the palace and they sell genuine sandal and Mysore silk. This is one of the genuine outlet out of two in Mysuru. Please buy from this shop if you intend to buy silk or sandal wood. Please don’t buy silk Sari or sandal wood from outside outlets as there is no guarantee on quality. Tour guide and cab drivers bring you to many outside shops to get commission. Please don’t fall in trap.  If you are in other state registered cars, they approach you that government shops selling Mysore silk without GST and try to cheat you."
23,Worth a special trip,Absolutely stunning and marvelous structure. It is very big. You have to remove shoes to enter palace. It was very crowded may be because of saturday. We could not see full lighting. Certainly best place in Mysore.
24,What a magnificant place,Very good place . Palace is very beautiful and historic. Well maintained by the government.loved to be once again there
25,An insight into the Royal life,The lighting was really nice to watch in the night. The palace really attractive. The inside can only be visited in the day
26,Definitely worth a visit,The palace is epitome of beauty. Heritage well maintained. It gave feel of time travel. Entry fee is 70 rupees for Indian nationlity. There is arrangement for keeping shoes at minimal cost. At 7 PM entire palace was illuminated. You should not miss this. The best part is you can sit down on the grass in front of palace and enjoy the view. These images don't do justice to the actual view.
27,Interesting and highly decorative.,"the palace is lovely and makes you think of a different era. Lovely patterns on walls etc. You can walk around at your leisure. In the evening it is lit, which is stunning as it covers up the dirt and dust."
28,Breathtaking!,Mysore palace is very nice. History re-visited. The Royals always had a lavish life.Entry ticket is Rs. 70 per adult. Footwear is not allowed in the palace. You need to deposit at the counter.
29,Mysore Palace,"A beautiful palace, extraordinary architecture, colorful interiors. The murals are incredible, the paintings seem to turn and face you while you walk along them. A worth while visit!"
30,Icon of the Mysore..,"The site is simply gorgeous!Soo rich by its architecture, colors, style.Silver's doors, huge columnThe garden is also beautiful.The market is very close to the palace"
31,The Fairy Tale Palace,"The palace is one lovely place to go to to see the royal's experience of living. Though not all areas are open for public, the ones which are are nice and well maintained. I do think the exhibits are few in number. I could not find a guide handy and mostly did a walking tour on my own. highly recommend to get a guide."
32,Heritage,Awesome experience. Amazing preservation of historical items included sculptures and paintings. A wonderful cultural experience.
33,Boring,"A vast area very clean and serene, surely missed the lighted palace which is only on Sundays we were told. The buggy ride for all those who don't want to walk the campus is a pleasure ride with few titbits from the guide. Palace stroll is very pleasant and good to see the preserved artefacts and the palace area. Good place to have pictures shot with palace background."
34,Incredible architecture!!!,"It's a must see palace in India. One gets enchanted by beauty and unique design, color combination and extravagant aura in it.Flower show is also organized post christmas till first week of Jan and it's really good."
35,Magnificent Palace,Great place to visit with temple nearby on site. Huge building with great architecture.  What luxury for the king to have lived in and green gardens add to splendour. Believe family still live in some part of palace but it's simply beautiful and my second visit in a few years.
36,A MUST VIEW PALACE WITH BAD ADMINISTRATION,It's a very nice tourist destination which I feel every one should go if time permits car parking is available but not very much nearby it's one of the best architectural excellence I feel and it should be in your list if you are visiting Mysore.Small babies can be carried in prams but there are lot of steps that you need to climb inside so plan accordingly
37,Just from outside for lighting ,This is one of the best place I have visited which is cherished with Indian history and a noble example for Indian architecture. Also this is a place with history in rich. One must go destination in India
38,The Kong’s Palace,"The palace is really beautiful but it was sooooo crowded (Saturday) and there are no signs, no tour guides, no information anywhere."
39,Wonderful,If you are in Mysore this should be top of the list. Stunning Architecture and art. Even though it was crowded it was still great. Very cheap too.
40,Palatial palace!,"A beautiful masterpiece that is maintained well by the government. The architecture is great and the palace is massive and will take half a day to roam around, click photos and view all the places."
41,Just WOW,"It was my first visit to this place . It was simply outstanding . Paintings , lightings , architecture amazes you . The view and over all visit was once in a life time experience"
42,Well worth a second visit,It's a striking building and that's makes it interesting to see from the inside. However there's not so much to see. it gives you an idea of the Maharaja family through the years. Can be quite busy during the weekend and public holidays
43,Amazing,The palace is a must see with all its lighting and grandeur. It’s a must see. Use local transport to avoid getting stuck in traffic and see the palace in all directions. It’s a beautiful sight.
44,"The Palace at night.......100,000 bulbs ...... astonishing!",One of the best palaces in india.The Durban Hall and Marriage Pavilion are superb.Be aware that you have to remove shoes and despite online messages stating no photography we were allowed to take stills and movie’s.
45,Well Maintained Palace. Worth Visiting.,"Everyone who's travelling to Mysore visits this Palace. So, you guessed correctly, it is always crowded.There's so much to show and the crowds need to be managed. So, things are lined up and you just browse through them. The big halls have an impact but some audio-visual could have improved their great appeal. Everywhere, there are cheap ropes or signage to manage the crowd. The grandeur is somehow lost.Having said that, if one is patient and visits at a less busy hour one can come back with a very good understanding of local history and bagful of good memories."
46,Mysore palace review,No 1 place to see in Mysore. The paintings are true to life - Caveat : need some time and patience to really appreciate the work. Impressive architecture both inside and outside. Will be more enjoyable on a weekday.
47,Beautiful Night and Day,This palace provides very good view of ancient kingdoms and sculptures since it's hot we could not enjoy the outdoors but looks are really good ..only problem are there are no clear signages and no clear guidelines over which you should leave chappal which has very big queue and little unorganised ...over all good place to visit which is not well organised in there
48,Must visit palace,The best place in mysore to visit with friends or family. It gives you the feel of our history in each of the wall
49,Amazing place,"We were there on Christmas Day so very crowded, but well worth a visit and we were lucky to see the palace all lit up at night, which was amazing."
50,Magnificent,What a grand palace!!!. Great architecture and located right in the heart of Mysuru city. This monument is the pride of Mysuru and is a must visit
51,Mysore Palace,"It's really looks amazing at night , I recently visited and it was really amazing at night .It's open around 7 at night .For entry no tickets required after 7 ."
52,History beyond imagination,Palace is huge and is the main attraction. Well maintained. One can understand how talented is architects of our india. Lot of decorations and huge structure. Mobile photography is allowed. On weekends there is light show in the evening.
53,Beautiful but small,It's the most famous tourist and historical place of Mysore.visitors favorite.and it's nice place to a lot of earlier times of history
54,Barely 100 years old,"Beautiful palace with lots of great photo opts! It was much cheaper entry fee than expected too, especially for the city’s major sight. Must see if you’re in Mysore."
55,Fascinating ,We loved the palace so much that we visited it twice. It was educational and felt very safe. If you visit this you must go on Sunday night to see the palace all lit up. Well worth a visit
56,Majestic..,It's an amazing heritage site.Very beautifully built and well maintained.It's a major attraction of mysore city.Must visit.
57,Splendid palace,"The good part about Mysuru is its simplicity, cleanliness and preservation.The palace is worth visiting. Go around sunset so you can see it in day light and stay back for the light and sound show."
58,Mysore Palace at night,It’s an experience of lifetime. It is big. Best is to get a guide for the tour. The palace has many things inbuilt otherwise which we cannot understand.
59,Must visit if you are in Bangalore ,"We've been traveling around South India and visiting many palaces, but this one way surpassed our expectations. The architecture is stunning and we wanted to photograph nearly everything. Yes, it is crowded, but the didn't seem that bad compared to other places we have visited. The residence museum on the property (charges separate admission) is also worth seeing, mostly for the art exhibit."
60,A Magnificent Structure ,"It's an absolutely stunning palace which worth a special visit. We didn't have the opportunity to see it at night time, but still could enjoy the visit."
61,Grand,Grand palace. Awesome interior. Well maintained. You have to leave footwear outside. Surroundings could be grander to match the interior.
62,Mysuru Palace,It is always a pleasure to see this beautiful palace and the magnificent and splendid illumination is really a treat for the eyes
63,Amazing palace ,I had no idea for what I was in for. Amazing palace; we took so many pictures. You were able to learn so much about Indian life and culture. I would definitely get a camel ride. We had ice cream there and it was great. I think you will find it worth your while. Parking could be a bit tricky. We also took a carriage ride around the city; that was just great too.
64,Worth to visit on Sunday evening and any daytime,"This is an impressive property with an interesting history. Definitely worth downloading the Pinakin app. The commentary is really interesting. No shoes inside so be prepared for a bunfight where you hand your shoes in. Typical Indian fashion, you get swept along by the crowd but if you step out of the flow to listen to the app, you get a different experience. I also visited the living quarters (separate ticket) which is quieter and there is some interesting furniture and other artifacts."
65,"Go twice, once on Sunday evening","Mysore palace is architectural marvel. We are astonished by the grandeur of the palace, its corridors, inner courtyard, durbar hall, marble flooring, teak finishings, ivory door works etc. The palace looks heavenly. Thoroughly enjoyed visiting the temple. The entrace is 70 rupees and worth every rupee.We also visited residential precincts of the palace, where we could find 600 year old wooden palace, where maharaja used to live. This place is not that much visited by people. but,l highly recommend this place also, as it gives a glimpse of the family life of the maharaja. The entrance is 40 rupees. it is definitely worth. I also took camel ride, which is very rare to get. Overall, very beautiful palace to visit. Must visit for mysore and top attraction in Mysore."
66,Fabulous palace,"It’s a place where the heritage, culture still exists Mysore palace it’s not a palace it’s a heritage palace.one of a kind experience witnessing the kings kingdom. Right time visit is during October dusheera time. Where one can witness the culture of the mysore and can enjoy the view of palace."
67,Nice,"I visited the Palace in Mysore whilst in Mysore for a business trip and to say it is beautiful is an understatement. The grounds and palace are stunning and on a weekend they are lit up 10000 bulbs. This is the fourth palace on the site, the first 3 burning down, and as a piece of information, the round things on the roof are water containers so that the palace was safe (learnt that on a tour of Mysore)"
68,Very Cool,This is a must watch place.as it's not like an ordinary palace as I saw many palaces but it's interior is so different and colorful .it's very nice to see in day time and totally different and nice to see in night time.don't miss it.
69,Architecture Masterpiece,"One must visit and enjoy the beauty of Mysore Palace. I rate this Palace as best in the world and the palace of Glory. Looks stunning when the palace lights are on. The lights are illuminated during weekends, Public holidays and during Navarathri. I am fortunate to be a mysorian who could enjoy it's beauty during different seasons and climatic conditions and looks awesome each time."
70, Skip residence wing!,"The Palace is centrally located, in spacious surroundings, GREAT condition and it IS the number one attraction in Mysore. NOT to be missed! Kehren and Rakesh 🙏🏻"
71,India trip 2020,This is a very attractive palace giving you a good perspective of it's proportions because of the space surrounding it. There are many beautiful ceilings and halls and an array of curios. It is quite crowded and one should choose a quiet window if you want to dwell on a painting or object. Well worth a visit
72,Fantastic,"Mysore PalaceUnlike Rajasthan Palaces, Karnataka is much more open. They actually allow you to take pictures. People touch the walls, the pillars, the mirrors and feel the legacy built over ages with sheer hard work....You can take a shared electric car ride around the palace as it is spread in a vast area. You will get to see the different parts of the property long with the explanation. The property is painstakingly maintained and is very beautiful.Internally, this magnificent structure flaunts elements of Odiyar, Islamic and English architecture. And of course, the 14 kg gold tower stands majestically with its head in clouds :)"
73,"Interesting place, but not that much to see",I have been to mysore palace 5 times. And it's one of the few kingdoms which still exist in india till now. The dasara festival is one the most celebrated festival in the region. And its higly recommendable to watch the palace at night with the lights on.
74,Not that historic a palace.,"This palace is one of the great sights of India. If you can arrange your schedule to suit, go on a Sunday evening between 7 and 8pm to see the whole palace exterior lit up with thousands of light bulbs. It is free entry (the palace itself is closed) and not particularly crowded. The palace itself, open in the day is again one of the most amazing buildings in India. Entry is Rs300.  It does get crowded but there is plenty of time and opportunity to see everything. There is a set route around the many spectacular rooms. It is a shoes-off visit, there is a shoe depository inside (don’t loose your shoe deposit ticket!) The extravagance and wealth of this palace is overwhelming. Photography is allowed. Highly recommended."
75,Spectacular bling,"This palace must be seen if you visit Mysore.  I have visited other palaces in Europe and Asia, but this is the best.  Well preserved and maintained.  Get there early due to the large crowds of visitors.  Very exquisite at night with all of the lights!"
76,Truly Worth Visiting,Must visit place. Beautiful ariciture. Good painting. Beautiful Lightings along with the museum good collection
77,Definitely Worth Visiting,"Nice location and very clean, properly maintained it required 4 hrs to watch and understand , at night it look so beautiful 😍 with lights"
78,"Crowded, crazy but worth it",Nice palace with interesting history... It's the highlight of Mysore. You can see it in like 15 min... The BEST part is in the back hidden next to the main gate where the elephants are... Nobody knows this and it's a cool place where you can see the elephants and get on them if you want.. Just need to pay tip to the handlers. ..
79,Visit to Mysore palace,Mysuru Palace is a beautiful place and a popular tourist destination.Its placed in the heart of the city and is easily approachable with all means of transportation. The lighting in the evening time is very impressive. Its surely a must visit place.
80,"A must do when in Mysore esp., Night Laser Show!!","Happened to be there on 1st January. Enjoyed new year eve at the Palace. Wonderful palace, beautiful flower decorations. Must visit during day as well as evening to see the illuminated palace."
81,One of the best palaces in India ,"Nice historical place with intricate design and artifacts. There should be a sign board or some literature detailing historic importance etc. BEWARE of touts and pick pocketers. It will take about 1:30-2 hours to see the place , I'll suggest have a meal and then enter as there nothing much inside for refreshments."
82,Fabulous palace!,"Most important place in Mysuru trip.ideal for all types of travellers.one can see the royal goods,articles  and materials as used by the Kings and their family.students, researchers,academicians ,painters and historians Must visit to study culture,tradition, heritage and history of Mysuru.one can see and enjoy royal world and learn in calm relaxing atmosphere in vast spaces of palace. I visited on 3 Sept 19.  Ideal for families touring .i takes at least 2 hours to visit and see charming palace and beautiful surroundings. It's a architectural and construction marvel of olden times."
83,Enchanting,"Wow the first Palace where we all pay the same price 70 rupees. What a pleasant surprise, it was well maintained with plenty of signage. It said somewhere no photos inside but this must have changed because everyone had their mobiles out😄 don’t miss it because it is clean, impressive and relaxing to visit the grounds and 14 temples 😄I didn’t do them all"
84,Loved this ,I visited Mysore palace recently. Really liked the place. Though it was bit crowded. But one definitely plan to visit.
85,"Can’t miss site, impressive ","The palace is truly one of the most beautiful in India, and especially in the evening when it is lit up with a million lamps. The tour takes about an hour or two. The best time to come is in the afternoon when it is less crowded."
86,Historical place,"This is a great Palace and pride of Mysore as well as India. View of this Palace is great .This is situated at heart of the city. There is nominal entry fee. Inside of the palace you can hire share auto to view out side of the fort. To view inside you should walk and upstair. The inside is very nice and you can enjoy old items used by kings and different type of paintings , statues, Singashans , wood work etc. To enjoy in total you cand spend 2 to 3 hours."
87,Legendary,"If you love history and architecture then you will love the visit to Mysore palace. I went on a Saturday so the place was bustling with tourist and school students. Perhaps if you have the leisure of time chose a working day to visit this place, hopefully there would be lesser people. The architecture is magnificent and grandeur. The only regret is I didn’t have a tour guide to learn the full history of the palace. As the place was too crowded, had to rush through the palace. Some places are worth pausing and taking in the beauty. A must visit if you go to Mysore."
88,must visit in mysore,I don't like to visit palaces and all things but mysore palace is beautiful and well maintained.i suggest to all visit atleast one time at palace.
89,Amazing Palace,"This is the highlight of Mysore, but there's plenty else to love in this fabulous city. Travel with a guide if possible, they will tell you details you're bound to miss on your own. We saw the six elephants owned by the family walking on the premises. Every room is a treasure! I would so gladly return at night!"
90,A must visit.,This is a great place to visit when in Mysore. External views of the palace are spectacular.  Internally there were many fascinating and beautiful areas with very interesting paintings and displays.
91,Mysore Palace Visit,"A friend and I visited the Mysore Palace recently, without any expectations or any idea of what the palace looked like in advance. I have travelled A LOT and have seen beautiful architecture all over the world and expected 'just another palace' before we arrived. I have to say, the inside of the palace took my breath away!This building is something very unique and overwhelmingly magical, completely different to anything I'd ever seen before. Do not miss Mysore or this beautiful example of architecture on your trip to India! ❤"
92,Magnificent Palace,The best attraction while at Mysore... everything is spic and span...well laid out and maintained. Visited during Dushera and New year..👌👌👍👍
93,palace build skill,"This is one thing you cannot miss if you visit Mysore. I was really mesmerized with the palace. I have seen a lot of places across the country, but none can beat this in terms of the royalty the palace has. Every inch of it is hand carved and simly awesome."
94,Must-see attraction if you are in Mysore!,"there is a wealth of things to see here , beautiful paintings on the walls , splendid rooms and chandeliers, wish we could have seen it light up at night , a young lady asked me to have a picture taken with her grandmother how nice was that , a lovely place to visit you can move at your leisure to take in the splenour of this beautiful palace"
95,A mesmerizing experience #1 must ,"The residence wing is terrible,  skip it!  The main palace on the other hand is amazing,  a must see. Old reviews saying you cannot take pictures appear to be out of date."
96,Beautiful palace-A must visit,Very magnificent place to visit.Much crowd.Online ticket system available valid for 6 months.Light & sound show a must watch.
97,A Royal Abode that is truly regal !,"A very good tourist spot. It is very important to take guide for viewing this. Guides stand at the entrance of the ticker counter. A lot information about Mysore, its kings & this palace can be obtained. Very very interesting"
98,Well maintained palace,Beautiful and truly something to see when in the area. It took us 3.5 hours to get there from Bangalore and then roughly 5 on the way back - ugh!!  The other challenge were all the people in the palace and you have to take off your shoes. I’ve never been that close to so many people at one time in my life. But beautiful!!!!
99,Beautiful ,"Must visit place in Mysore. You can experience the royalty with which Kings of past used to leave and so much wealth they use to have have to design place to such a level. Each carvings on doors and windows , color and painting on walls are You can come back late as well to see from outside 98k bulbs illuminating the Royal palace. It looks amazing.Go see for yourself."
100,Mysore Palace,Mysore Palace is one among the best i have seen great artwork well maintained palace.  defenetly a must visit place for people who are visiting mysore
101,Beautiful lighting,"It was our desire from many years and we did it on 30th May. It was simply superb. It is classic, benchmark example for Old Indian heritage. Highly impressed with grandness, richness & greatness. Guide helped to know many old stories of royal family"
102,GRAND,You can see the life style of King by their photographs and chairs and portraits. Costlier to see. Great look of Palace.
103,Nice palac ,A very impressive palace inside and out with huge history. Photography now allowed inside. Especially impressive when the lights switch on - but only on Sunday evening.
104,A Popular Palace for Tourists,"Normally very crowded in vacation time, but you can not afford to miss this place. It still has sufficient glimpses of those royal days and culture."
105,Never get bored ,"The Palace is a must for everyone.But ikeepk during dasara festival.but keep your legs strong to walk and take a look at the beautiful  structure,art,architecture of earlier time"

107,Palace visit,"Great palace. A must visit. The court area, the ornaments, the thrones, the paintings and the construction itself all worth viewing and appreciating. There was also a beautiful temporary garden set for the winter season. Being school holidays, many school teams were also there, very crowded."
108,Heritage palace ,The view of the illuminated palace from the close vicinity was a different experience.The flower show and the cultural program going on were added attractions.Too much crowd and that was actually what I did not like.Otherwise very good experience.
109,"Fabulous, do not miss","The place to be on a Sunday evening at 1900. The lights go on, it's a fantastic sight. Its busy, you queue for entry tickets, then to get in. Security is tight, bags looked in. The lights are on for an hour.Inside the palace again queue for tickets, shoes to be removed and paid for storing. There is audio via wifi, to guide you round. Lots of history, an interesting couple of hours inside."
110,BEAUTIFUL,The palace is a good place to visit if you are in the Mysore area. The highlight is the light and sound show from 7-7:45pm and the lighting after that during the weekdays. Unfortunately we visited when the narration was in Kannada. I understand they do have narration in English on other days. Maybe on our next visit we will plan to be there during the English narration.
111,First place to visit in mysore,The magnificence and grandeur of the palace is something worth seeing by all.The history and culture of the Mysore rulers is displayed in the palace. The architecture and the interior design  is Indo- Saracenic. A visit to the palace is worth every moment.
112,Stunning,"It was a unique experience. Palace open from 10.00 AM. We also took help of guide so that we could under stand things much better. Guide charges was Rs. 350 for 40 miniutes. it was an very good experience. Nice view of Palace from outside, visiting Diwan -a- Khas and Diwan - a - aam. Greenary around Palace. Overall worth visit"
113,Switch your lights on irrespective of rains,"I don't have to give much description about Mysore palace its a must visit place in Mysore you can explore more about culture and architecture, main attraction is 750kg ambari inside palace. I think its less than 100rs entry for Indians. Sun evening palace will be filled with lights it's amazing to visit."
114,Awesome Grandeur,"The Palace is a must for everyone. But it keeps during the Dasara festival. but keep your legs strong to walk and take a look at the beautiful structure, art, architecture of the earlier time."
115,Lighting is beautiful,"Beautiful day, flawless and symmetrical architecture. The teal and salmon colored hallway was my favorite. Beautifully carved wooden doors that I am sure hold the stories of 100s of year, cool marble tile under your bare feet as you glide in and out of history. It was an amazing experience"
116,Palace,"Worth a a visit for two-three hours. Extensive site. We missed seeing palace lit up which happens during festivals and Sundays. Would like to have seen this.Some very interesting artefacts. Doesn’t cost very much to enter grounds, but had to pay a little extra to look at private quarters."
117,Just beautiful,Visited Mysore palace with my husband to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary. It is a very beautiful palace with a royal heritage historical background. It is one of the most fanous tourist spot in India. I went there to be the queen and my husband to be the king. It feels like we are also from the royal entity. Must visit place in Mysore. A trip to Mysuru never be completed without visiting the palace.The entry fee is very reasonable. There are some temples in the behind the palace. There is a golden chariot for the Devi Sri Chamundeshwari.
118,Stunning!,"I had visited this beautiful palace of Tipu Sultan in August 2019.beauty of this palace can’t be expressed in words.From ceiling to the floor,walls to doors,everything has its own beauty. I like the wooden doors,those ceilings design,,,The best time to visit this is evening as you will also get to see the lighting show which is really mesmerizing....Restaurant,shops are there inside for eatables and soft drinks.There is residential wing also of this palace for which you need to take another ticketOverall great ambience...Ticket cost :Palace-₹70Residential wing-₹45"
119,Worth a visit,The grandeur of the palace is to be seen. The palace tour includes a large hall starting with a lot of dolls that were collected. The tour also includes a view of the court room from where the front grounds of the palace are visible. This may have been used in the past. There is an app available for an audio tour - though I did not use it. Additional quarters are available at the back with two temples. The front gardens had a flower decorated place. The entrance for parking (if you are driving) can be slightly confusing.
120,Very good,The place is about a 10 minute walk from most places in Central Mysuru. In my 3 weeks in India this was by far the best Palace I saw. Inside is stunning. We had a guide which helped to get a feel for the building. As always sometimes the detail given is a bit much to cope with and take it in. However on this occasion a guide was well worth it.
121,Ms,Seeing the Mysuru Palace lit up at night is well worth a visit.  This includes  all the buildings in the courtyard and the gates.  There was also a small band  playing in front of the palace which added to the atmosphere.
122,Fabulous piece of history ,This is a nice looking place however when the lights come on wow! I believe they only illuminate 7 to 8 pm on a Sunday evening but if your in town there well worth seeing. It was very popular but the place is huge so it’s easy to get a great view.
123,Beautiful,Mysuru Palace is one of the Indias most visited palace. It is a beautiful place to visit. The best time to visit the palace is during Dussehra festival. The Palace sparkles in the darkness with a thousands of bulbs which makes it more beautiful. Best day to visit the palace is Sunday during evening time. A must visit place when u r in mysuru
124,Impressive place to visit,"A must visit plac in Mysore, great architecture works, very well maintained, very good tourist attraction. Ample parking space available for tourists."
125,The Palace of Mysore ,"The palace is a good place to visit if you are in the Mysore area. The highlight is thatEvery Sunday, public holiday and Dussehra night it's stunning to see the whole palace lit up for one hour from 7 pm to 8 pm! apart the entry is free during that period. The palace interiors are so artistic that you will get mesmerized. Beautiful artifacts, paintings, furniture are on display. Architecture & beauty of the palace is awesome. There are many ancient temples around the palace."
126,Magnificent,"This beautiful palace and grounds is well worth a half day.  The main building is superbly decorated with pillared halls and excellent murals.  We were pleased to find that, since our previous visit, restrictions on videoing inside the building have been lifted."
127,AWESOME,Main interesting place in the Mysuru.. Icon of the royal City...Your tour not complete without the Royal Palace.. well maintained.. very pleasant visit.. Entrance fee for the adult ₹70 and for the children₹30..
128,Wow!,"This is palace in Mysore. Entry fees is Rs. 70 Well maintained palace. Palace is just amazing very rich, heritage palace. Maharajah chair mirror and many original products are displayed Must visit this."
129,Great Palace to visit to understand the life of Maharajas,"One of the most visited palaces in India specially at the time of festival called Dushera. exceptionally well celebrated. Lots of people from more than 40 countries take part in this festival. i visited this palace before festival on an ordinary day and on the Dushera Day, it was extraordinary felling can't explain, n number of people around you more that in a cricket match celebrating the festival with joy, ever one must have these feeling once, all people for one cause. exceptional work by the mysuru people. one of a kind. congratulations of wadiyar family."
130,Mysore Palace is recommended for tourists to the Mysore City,"We recently visited Mysore Palace and were amazed by its beauty esp., the night show. The same day morning we visited the palace and did a full tour which we captured with our 4K camera. We have posted both Day Tour and Night Show of Mysore Maharaja Palace on our website and also on youtube channel CoupleOnWheelz. A 45 minute sound and light show depicts the 400 year history of Mysore in various languages. Each day the show will be presented in a specific language. So go through the details and choose the language you are comfortable with.We have posted complete visitors guide too on our CoupleOnWheelz youtube channel.CheersCouple on Wheelz"
131,Better than possibly expected!,"There is so much to see and absorb in this amazing palace that it was good to be able to go back again after a 6 year gap.  It did not disappoint and, despite the school parties and tour groups, we were able to spend all the time we needed to look around.  We had an excellent guide who was able to give us much more information than we’d had on our previous visit and I was particularly impressed that so much of the materials that were used in its construction and decoration originated in my native city of Glasgow.The grounds too are beautifully laid out and the whole site is well worth a visit."
132,Mysore palace visit,a towering palace with its grandeur of royals who rule the state. the state of art and architecture that prevailed   a those t time is on display. the transport method and the warfare used also on display
133,Night light amazing ,"Nice historic place where one would probably like to spend some time and see things. However, the experience is more like buying a ticket and getting pushed along by a moving crowd. Take pictures as you walk and exit with the crowd.I appreciate that it is not advisable to keep entry-rates high as this would deter a large population.I know that the rich and political classes can visit this place at any odd time when the palace is empty due to their political clout. But what about the middle class??I feel the entry-fees can be in three slots. One of them free, one priced moderately and the other priced very high. This would spread the crowd and allow people the choice of paying higher to avoid getting pushed from behind by the crowds. In other words ... if you need a better experience, pay more and subsidise the fees for those who find it difficult to pay."
134,Huge palace,"Don't miss if in Mysore or near, truly spectacular, and then while in Mysore visit the market. Spices, perfumes etc. and with less hassle than many other Indian markets. We thoroughly enjoyed. A fine place to visit eg from Bangalore."
135,MUST VISIT,"Mysore palace is a good place to see and experience briefly the grandeur and lavishness of the lifestyles of the rich and the royal. There is art all around you, in the floortiles, the artisitically painted and decorated walls, the pillars, the arches, the chandeliers....plenty of photo ops."
136,VIP visit to the Mysore Palace,"It's a distinct feeling to visit Palaces and to ponder about the lives of Kings. Well maintained palace.Palace will be lit in the evenings from 7-8 pm. Except on Sundays and Government holidays, sound and light show will be held at the same time. The lighting and the beauty will be etched in ur mind."
137,Best palace experience in India,Historical place. Architecture is excellent. Takes 2 hours . Kitchen wing also eye catching. Portraits of  royal family is awesome. Must visit on weekends or national holidays as the lighting is marvelous
138,A visit to Mysore,Sorry to see the state it is in.A lot of restoration needed. There in pinakin app but no wifi to listen into the audio guide. Added to no mobile signal inside.This magnificent palace had seen some good days but now it has to be present even better. Lot of broken tiles and platforms.
139,Mysore palace,One of the best attraction in mysore.well maintained palace with grand feel.Avoid weekend s.winters advisable.
140,Great palace of mysoor,"Must Visit place if you are in Mysuru.It's beauty cannot be described in words. Once you enter the place, you can feel the history, architecture, decoration such a royal look. Only on Sundays and festivals, lights will be lighted."
141,Royal Circuit,"Several rooms in the palace are breathtaking, my favourite being the Public Durbar Hall with its magnificent columns. I particularly loved the tiger bronzes of W Rober Colton."
142,Excellent tourist destination,"This is the only such Big Beautifull Palace in South India,sarrounding having lot of place with gardens ,out of 4 entrence Mahadwar only north gate is open for visitors,nominal entrence fee,inside also it will take lot of time to watch all places ,better take guide,if u are intrested visiting temples ,u can visit sarrounding temples within Palace campus."
143,Major attraction of Mysuru,"We went on a Wednesday and as unexpected,still it was crowded.   Worth a visit if you are in mysore.Palace can be covered in max of 1 hour. No special charges for  taking photos, that's good. Ticket is priced nominally, just 70Rs and it's definitely worth a visit."
144,Visit to see,"take a drive from Bangalore you will not be disappointed visiting the palace, and the scenery on the drive is worth taking in...the palace complex is filled with rich architecture...the silver doors are intricately crafted, the audience hall and ceiling ornaments are also amazing..."
145,Beautiful Royal Palace,Huge palace and very famous one. Takes 2-3 hours if you are not in hurry. Is very crowded during weekends. There are some temples in the campus. You cannot enter the palace with chappels or shoes. So keep them at the shoe counter. Ticket price is 50 per head and photography is free.
146,Mysore palace,"Mysore palace, constructed in the ancient fort area, is one of the sought after destination in India and official residence of Wadiyar clan. Existed since 14th century but the current palace was built in early 20th century. Architecturally it amalgamates major Indian styles like Mughal and Rajput along with temples design with Gothic structures. Pink marble domes with shinning brass sits on top of a three storied greyish granite stone structure, is coupled with a Hugh tower. Surrounded by a large garden and three main gates and only the southern gate is used by tourists. Eastern gate is used only for especial occasions. Emblem and coat of arms of Wadiyar dynasty is coupled with ‘Never Terrified’ motif in Sanskrit. A sculpture of Gajalakshmi surrounded by elephants to indicate the wealth, prosperity and abundance. Several temples were built inside the original fort area. Durbar halls are used during Dashara festivities. The clan is devotee of ‘Chamundi Devi’ and not surprising the palaces faces Chamundi hills.The main audience hall’s passageway are beautifully decorated with artistic designed roof ceiling(s). At the start of the entrance passageway one can view the figures used during ‘Dashara Festival’ which are adorned by elephants at the entrance. A small courtyard is graced by two ferocious tigers. Many paintings can be found inside the enclosure. The royal wedding hall has walls outlining the royal Dashara festival of 1930’s in large oil paintings. The hall itself has Belgian glasses and chandeliers along with iron pillars. Massive public durbar hall views all across the main gate and the parade ground.Must visit on Sunday nights to admire the well-lighted palace with thousands of light bulbs gives it a dreamy view? The palace is open from 10am to 5pm."
147,Over crowded but still ..,"This is one of the most grandest and magnificent structures in India, steeped in history and tradition and the architectural grandeur is indeed amazing. You have to remove your footwear so please keep the token safely. The hall and the pillars are an awesome sight. Though I visited on Monday morning, still there was a big crowd. I missed seeing it with the lights. I did not have the benefit of a guide so was unable to appreciate the full history of the Palace. It takes around 30 to 45 minutes to complete the tour. Please don’t miss visiting this Palace when you are in Mysore."
148,Go twice. ,"We went there with family, entry tickets of ₹70 adults and ₹30 kids. Outside it was good but as soon as you enter there is huge rush with push and pull. Very few section is open to be seen others are all closed. It is only darbar hall which is good all other stuff is like a museum with display if gifts etc. You don't get a feel of palace. On top of that no ventilation or AC place suffocates when huge rush."
149,Good for a glimpse of Royal life,"I visited the palace and surrounding grounds one Sunday recently - the first weekend after the famous Dasara celebrations. My colleague and I soon realised that our choice of weekend to visit was not ideal. The place was packed with local visitors. In visiting the main part of the palace we found ourselves shuffling among a multitude of families - I was grateful that I am a good heads height taller than the average Indian, thus ensuring some fresh air. Negotiating the narrow stairs to the first floor was a particular challenge, especially in bare feet (you have to leave your shoes at the entrance area). All in all, the grandeur of the palace and surrounding buldings is magnificent. It's true that, close up, you can see that the years have taken their toll and certainly some maintenance is needed. As for the expansive grounds, we took a long, leisurely stroll around, admiring the views and enjoying the balmy warm, sunny weather. It's a pity that we couldn't stay long enough to see the place all lit up with the 100.000 bulbs that adorn the facade. Maybe next time - at a quieter time of the year."
150,Must visit to learn about heritage of Mysore. Well maintained.,We were three families but we decided to forego the place visit inside due to summer heat and long queue. The line for cloak room to keep shoes were serpentine. If you have elederly than pls note the washroom are at great distance from main gate. I thing this place can be managed better. People were pushing each other in the queue inside the palace.this place has historical significance and it needs to be captured in better manner perhaps with sound and light show. Pls avoid if u have small kids and weekends.
151,One time place(40INR),"We travelled to Mysore primarily to see the Mysuru Palace.  We were not disappointed!  All of us in our party commented that it is as beautiful as the Taj Mahal.  The history of the building is well-documented with text and photos through-out the palace.  I highly recommend a trip to Mysore to see the Palace.  Mysore itself has a different ""vibe"" to many Indian cities, and an appeal all its own.  Highly recommended."
152,Nice Palace,Actually according to me Mysore itself is a historical place.there are many Kings ruled over there.mysore palace is the one of The famous historical place in karnatak in india. Everyday they are many visitors come to see the buetyness  of the palace.not only the buety but also to see them historical things and metirials.when they see the that see feel happy and enthusiasm . To visit this palace there thousands of people come from different states and even different countries .
153,Fascinating place ,It is extremely beautiful. There are two palaces within same campus. One is new palace which you at the front and old palace which is just at the back of the new palace.You need some time to visit the palace as it has lot of treasure in it. Extremely beautiful.
154,One Word Excellent,The Mysore palace is a must to visit for all tourists. The entry to the palace is well organized. The palace gives a good history of the Mysore rulers using paintings. There are few artifacts but these are not missed. The palace is very well maintained and the colors on the walls and pillars are exquisite.
155,Mysore Palace under lights,An amazing visit both day when you can go inside the palace and night time Saturday and Sunday from 7pm to see it illuminated. The daytime visit you should allow 2 to 3 hours to walk around .such fantastic architecture and art on display. A well worth experience while in Mysore. Not to be missed.
156,You just cannot miss the Light and Sound show.,"visited this stunning palace with my sister on route to Ooty, last winter, stayed here for like 2-3 hours and took some great shots. Its an amazing place and as per me, the best tourist site in whole India."
157,The official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty.,Great site-seeing place to see the earstwhile royal living; better to visit in the evening so one can complete the inner palace visit and also wait for the lighting show thereafter
158,Great ,"Visited the palace at night when it was lit up - breathtakingly beautiful. I have not seen anything like it in Europe or elsewhere. The interiors are really nice as well. You can imagine how grandiose it looked back in the day. If in mysore, its an absolute must. I would recommend visiting even if you have seen the palaces in rajasthan."
159,Less Interesting than Udaipur or Jaipur Fort,Beautiful palace which is being restored by government one should hire a guide as it saves time and helps you understand everything about the palace and its history
160,Go on a Sunday evening ,"We have visited this palace on weekdays so could not able to see palace lighting.(lighting only on sat,sun and Government holidays).Palace timings -10 am to 5.30pm.About palace -well maintained palace and worth visiting at ₹70.However unable to understand why they still using old type of bulb where as they can use new LED lamps to save the electricity.Good thing is you need to visit this palace without your shoes.Overall good experience and njoyed lot.Note - Please do not waste time and money by visiting king stay building."
161,A royal evening...,"Mysore Palace is one of the top attractions of Mysuru. We were there to experience the famous light and sound show actually. But we missed it as birth centenary of Maharaja Jaya Chamaraja was celebrated on same day and  the light and sound show was cancelled for that day. The palace is beautiful. It is very well maintained and clean. The big flower garden and the Shweta Baraha Temple right at the entrance surely catch your eyes. The temple represents the typical South Indian temple architecture. Both are very well maintained. An evening walk in the palace lawn will be a memorable experience for everyone.If you want to enter the palace museum, you have to remove your footwear and have to enter the palace barefoot. There are lots of shoe-counter for keeping your shoes, so you don't need to worry. Just take the queue and enjoy the beautiful interior.Inside the palace, royal touches are preserved well. The beautiful wooden doors, the endless corridors, the colourful roof decors, each and everything the maharajas used are well kept and are very very attractive. You don't need to take a guide here as every information regarding each of them are written with. Though it is a crowded place, but don't worry, everything is very systematic here. So, take your time and observe everything, don't hurry. Don't miss the light decoration of the palace at evening."
162,Lights Up!,Get a look at how the kings of Mysore lived. Well preserved and beautiful. Recommend going with a guide because there isn’t a lot of information on site.
163,Mysoor palace,"Mysore is not a big Town on India,1 800 000 people,so the first impression of the town is not about  a «waouhhh ». But this monument is just wonderful and give to the town a magical mood....The price for the visit is not expensive and the monument is clean"
164,Mysore Trip,"Mysore Palace is a wonderful,  historical n magnificent building located in the state of Karnataka in 'Incredible India'.Built by Wadiyar Kings who ruled the Mysore area...the colourful n detailed ceilings, floors n walls are a treat to watch. Mysore is locally called Mysuru these days (after a demon Mahishasur who resided here in ancient times).Historically, Gangas, Hoysalas, Vijaynagara Kings,Wodeyars, Hyder Ali & Tipu Sultan have ruled Mysore.It is said that Hindu God Sri Rama on his way to Lanka, from Panchvati via Kishkindha(Hampi) route, passed through Mysuru.In 1897 AD,the wooden Mysuru Palace was destroyed due to an accidental fire during wedding ceremony of Queen Jayalakshamamanni .Queen Vanivilasa Sannidhana initiated the construction of New Mysore Palace and got it completed after 15years in 1912 under the supervision of Engineer Raghuvulu Naidu.Total area is about 72 acres. Also called Ambavilasa Palace, it's designed in Indo-Sarcenic architecture style. A spectacle of breathtaking beauty. Must watch . Thanks. Yours ..Rajesh Khoth, Sirsa, Haryana, India. 7988876084"
165,Architecture styles,"The palace for sure is listed in every traveller's to-go list when travelling to Mysore. The grandeur of the palace, the beautiful paintings, the well-maintained carvings make this palace of one its kind. But nothing compares to the beauty of the palace when illuminated during the late evenings. We went on a Sunday and on that day illumination from 7 pm to 8 pm was provided a free entry. The whole palace looked like a giant jewel in Gold. It will surely be cherished for my entire life."
166,Historical palace,"Must visit place during Dussara. LPalace is all decked up with lights are embraced with cultural activities and other activities around the palace,.."
167,Holyday trip,It is so great to watch Mysore palace lighting. 7 pm on all sundays. All stress gets instantly reduced when you view the palace. I have had the privilege of seeing old Maharaja in 1964 walking down Chamundi hills.
168,Grand Palace,"This very richly decorated Palace is a must see for those wanting a peek into a Rajah's  Royal residence . The pomp and splendor of the princely era is on full display . A knowledgeable guide will be a big plus, as they point out all the little details and tell you stories of the bygone days."
169,Fascinating glimpse into Mysore’s past,Fabulous building to wander round and enjoyed light and sound show in English on a Friday night. Leave enough time to be able to appreciate all this building has to offer and check the website for days of English speaking light and sound. Be aware you have to leave the grounds for an hour between 6 and 7.
170,Mysore palace visit during Dasara festival.,"If you ever go to Mysore please visit this place, very rich in history and the king still lives there. People are very friendly and helpful, take lots of pictures outside, pictures in the palace need permission/not allowed.Shoes not allowed. Tips: Bring water Bring umbrella Scarves Comfortable shoes Get souvenirs they are really amazing looking such as elephant etc."
171,Good,Go to see the lighted palace in the evening. Try to attend the lecture. It’s really a great spectacle and not expensive.
172,Magnificent but very popular,"If you are in Bangalore city for the first time, you will be tempted to see the Mysore Palace. It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. Frankly speaking I was not at all  impressed. The old palaces are must see for the history lovers. This is not an ancient building. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt. Any way, a palace is a palace. It is better to see this palace."
173,Palace visit. ,A definite visit with some amazing rooms to see.  A must and take some time to take in all the splendor of this magnificent Palace.
174,Beautiful,"This is the official residence of the royal family of Mysore and is surrounded by a large garden - set in the centre of town.  It is a blend of Hindu, Muslim, Rajput and gothic architectural styles.  Expect to see cows wandering through the main concourse during your visit.The interior has some grand columns and paintings all well worth the visit.There are crowds of locals also visiting so expect to be crushed by the sheer volume of people.  Shoes are left outside with a guard for a small fee.On Sunday nights the palace is illuminated, something we had travelled thousands of miles to see......it was not to be, unfotunately some dignitary had died that day and the palace was not lit up !"
175,Needs professional handling of visitors,Good and worth of visit. Good for photography. Avoid visit on Holidays due to rush. Good place to visit
176,Must visit place in Mysore,"The most famous calling card of Mysore, probably. Palace is huge, try going either in morning or in evening. Noon heat can be troubling. The grandiose of the kings is on display. There is lot of security here. Ground & first floors are open to public. Adjoining building is the actual residence of the royals and needs a separate ticket. One can spend at least an hour or two depending on time at hand and interest in history. Guides too, are available."
177,Mysuru Dushera,Mysore palace is a great destination for heritage lovers. Here have beautiful gardens and big palace.
178,The Day Trip to Mysore,Palace was brimming with interesting features.  A local guide is highly recommended to get the most out of this special place.
179,Palace of Glory,There are people visiting the palace n many flock around at 740 for the lights on. But when i went the lights on was cancelled jus becos it wa raining. U travel n wait in rain with your 9 month kid for this and you get a thumbs down?? Thats bad. Highly disappointed
180,Beautiful and Crowded,It is gigantic palace giving the glimpse of royal life. It is soo beautiful and of the famous heritage site situated in Mysuru city.
181,Good ,"Even in the off season, there are quite a few visitors going through the palace but we were still able to feel comfortable and take all of the pictures we desired.  Note that no shoes are allowed but there is an effective system for keeping your shoes safe while you tour (for 2 INR per pair).  The palace itself is very impressive—not just big, but quite ornate, especially considering that most of the palace is open to the environment.  It’s an all day trip from Bangalore to see the palace and get back to Bangalore but it’s a very worthwhile day trip.  Highly recommended."
182,Visit to Mysore palace during Dussehra,Great place to visit must go. Be ready to walk. Govt rules are little mess for process for keeping shoes.
183,Nice palace,"We visited in the evening for the Light Show. Unfortunately we missed the English version but it was still an enjoyable show with lighting effects that were obviously telling the timeline history of the Palace and its Sultan.Returned the following day and were approached by a guide (with an ID on a lanyard) who offered his services for 45 minutes at a very reasonable price. My husband is hard of hearing and the guide was accommodating. he also extended his time to allow for photographs. His patience was tested when we were stopped by numerous locals for a photograph of us but he eventually joined in the fun - pointing out the best places for the photos. The guide tried to assist a quick exit for us - but we were pleased we took the usual route past the museum and garden. Guards within the Palace keep people moving along - so 1-2 hours inside the palace is ok. Gardens and the museum added to that time.  All in all, people of Mysore restored our trust somewhat."
184,Visit during Dussara,I haven't seen a palace any better than this in my life... It was really so beautiful.. it was a treat to watch for us... The inside views give you so much pleasure... It's all golden...
185,Beautiful and lit up during dusshera,I love the staff and the caring from rupa she is always there with the guest for their help and suggest some good foods he really have a good communication and ability I would like to thank all the staff also its a good time in radisson thank you ..........
186,One of the best kep,Nicely maintainedPalatial beautyCrowded on holidays & weekends. Takes almost 4-5 hrs for full tour.
187,Visited for the lights,"History in full glory. Shoes need to be removed so wear accordingly. Avoid holidays as it becomes extremely crowded. And, lighting happens every Sunday from 7 to 7:45 pm. Must see."
188,Mysore palace,Mysore is an ideal stop over for many trips staring from Bangalore ending in southern hills. On one of your trips when you are in Mysore do visit the Royal Palace once in day time and once in the evening. It's a DIY tour but you can hire a guide if you wish. The main Palace is majority about court rooms and assembly halls. The Residential annex is at back side of main palace and displays Royal lifestyle. Both the buildings are to be seen bear foot. Refreshments  washrooms and shopping centred are available on premises.Visit to Main Palace costs  Rs 70 per adult and to Residential annex it takes additional  Rs 45. Footware to be left for Rs 2 per pair.  Tendering exact change is suggested for less hassle.
189,Look into history,awesome piece of history. dont miss the lighting and illumination of the palace in evenings. (if its not raining)
190,Great palace,it is a must visit place. if you are not interested in full tour then at least take a short visit in evening time to have a look from outside. you can drive your car around it to take different views from different entrances.
191,Royal place,One of the famous palace in India. Situated in the state of Karnataka. Here we can see the wonderful style of architecture.
192,Famous palace,Excellent..Palace and royal living discovered the best way..Masterpiece of architecture and royalty and rich glory of Indian past!
193,Grand place,"Museum parts are a well maintained collection of Royal arts, gifts and frescos that give visitors a better appreciation for the history of Mysore. Amazing architecture both inside & outside of the palace are reminiscent of Versailles in luxury & grandioseness. Helps to have a guide who can provide context for the various parts of the palace, but can be well navigated on ones own with some online references."
194,Just outstanding ,"Palace is an epitome of work of art; the detailing in every single door, wall, pillars, roof, artwork etc were mind blowing. The expansive garden in front and on the side add to the aura of the place. At the far end of the palace are 6 elephants; you can touch them and take pictures with them - it was really cool. If you have the luxury of visiting the palace during the weekday, I highly recommend it. The operations were streamlined to some extent, but the weekend  foot traffic makes it a bit ineffective. Please know that you barely have place to walk inside the building, people are literally pushing and trying to get ahead of you. You will be walking uncomfortably close to others ahead and behind you and almost the entire time you are inside the building you will have to bear with the smell of hair and sweat - just letting you k ow what to expect over the weekend. Another annoying part was not knowing that the residence visit was not included in the general ticket, so the guys sent us away. It wasn’t mentioned anywhere - I don’t mind paying, but please give a heads up. There are too many workers, mostly just sitting around sipping tea and head buried in the newspaper or phones, while they could be assisting visitors with information like these (do their job). All in all, do visit once for the experience."
195,Well maintained palace,Palace is maintained in pristine condition. Lots of display of gifts and items used by royal family. Palace is huge and need to walk around quite some time. Leaving footwear outside is a bit chaotic.
196,Amazing Views...,Attending light and sound show. The history was narrated in a simple but lucid way. The icing on the cake is illumination after the show. Wow.
197,Amazing experience,Enormous palace which would give a glimpse of how extravagant Indian Kings were till 19th century. The dusshera celebrations during October is the major attraction here.
198,Must see in Mysore,it is in the heart of mysore city. It is very huge and well maintained. There is also an elephant ride inside for those interested at an extra cost. You will require 1 hour plus to see the palace peacefully. Be sure to carry sunglasses and caps as it gets very hot and sunny in mysore
199,Royal feast,Not reccomend place . The thing far away from you . They take money for entry and for keeping shoes .
200,Wonderful,You must this palace if you are in Mysore. Best time to visit the palace is during dusshrea. This is a huge palace where you can opt for a tour. Photography is allowed in some area. Campus is huge and you can very well spend half day in this palace. This palace gets beautifully decorated during Durga Puja
201,Amazing artifacts and historical things,Light & sound show was very good and informative. It was a good presentation.At the end illumination of palace was excellent.One need not wait for Sunday to see illumination of palace.
202,Majestic palace - a must visit for art and history lovers,"One of the best hotel in Mysore which shows the real experience of hospitality, kudos to the entire team for such great service and specially the front office team for such quick response"
203,one of the best tourist places in Mysore,"Just so amazingly built, the architecture and mammoth building standing just makes it one of the beautiful icon of Mysore"
204,Must-see place in Mysore ,Never knew a palace in India could be so fantastic. Go with enough time. take a guide at extra cost of Rs300. make sure he speaks English. there is a lovely shop at the exit which sells nice pearl earrings. Great gifts. Enjoy!
205,Impressive,"We visited the palace for the night show unfortunately not knowing that the specific day was for a ""KANNADA"" show rather than and English one. The Lighting show was spectacular and the overall walk was awesome. We were informed at the gate that we could exit from the opposite side and the timings were from 7-8 p.m., but the Cop on other side of the gate tried to harass us by stopping us at 7:50 p.m. and telling us that we were illegally inside the premises with a valid ticket and the show timings were over despite us being able to still view the palace changing the lights. Honestly it wasn't a pleasing experience for two young foreigners in Mysore,India being harassed by the cop at the gate at night."
206,should not miss it.,"A marvel in its own kind. We went in the afternoon and were there till illumination of the palace and that is the best part of it.Day time, one can go inside for a detailed and elaborate visit. It may take you one whole day, to read the details and to fathom the sequence.A never miss visit to Mysuru."
207,The EVER CHARMING palace,One of the most important place in Mysore trip. The palace is really one of the most beautiful palace in India. Superb views at evening.
208,Must Visit in Mysore,"Its great place to visit. Well maintained monument. We need to take out foot wear out side for which proper arrangement is done.We visited in the morning on weekday , so not much crowd.We can capture photos using mobile camera without any extra charge."
209,good ,"Amazing to see palace during day and wonderful to see in evening.Best to take guide.Don’t miss the evening sound and light show, which happens daily. Some people may miss guide it happens only on weekend."
210,Grand,"To enjoy this i must suggest you take a certified guide, we took an english speaking guide from the security point at the entrance of the palace ... and that made all the difference ... We thoroughly enjoyed"
211,Mysore Palace,Mysore palace is also known as amba vila palace is one of the famous tourist attraction in india. Best place to visit with family as well as friends. And Dasara fastival is the main celebretion here.
212,Grand,Never gets old. This was my 17th or 18th visit. Visit during Dussera for best experience. The light show was not available due to rain expectancy.
213,Proud,Those who visit Mysore must visit Mysore palace and it is incomplete without visiting Mysore Palace.  One must take registered guide so that the minute details can be explained
214,Exquisite ,"I went during the day, so missed the lights, but if you are looking to get out of Bangalore, this is a nice day trip option (mind you the drive is not for the faint of heart, even as a passenger).  The Palace tour could take as little as 20 minutes or much longer if you wish to see everything in detail.  You'll need to remove your shoes before entering, which can be a process for a non-local to figure out with different lines for different reasons."
215,walk through the magnificient history,"every holiday (especially Sundays), the palace is lit up - sharp at 7AM .. it is good to capture that moment when the lights go on .. its splendid .. very well done lighting and enough area around the palace to relax and enjoy the view .. parking is available in townhall and is easy to access"
216,Grand Palace!!!,This is the main attreaction of mysuru. Entry ticket is cheap. Camera allowed to premises but not allowed inside palace. They have locker room to keep phones and cams. The palace belongs to mysuru royal family. You will get to see lot of antique works inside the palace and is worth visit atleast once. The palace is decorated with light every sunday evening for visitors. And it looks stunning in that.
217,Memorable experience,"This visit was the most unforgettable holidays of my life. we visited the world famous Mysore palace the first day  .the beauty mad us astounded, n the artifacts , paintings, architecture, was just mesmerizing. the lighting seen at night was simply good made us feel like being in heaven.we took photos and enjoyed a lot, we offered pooja to the lord Ganesha, n several other temples found at the entrance. All in all we ,we had a good holiday, which was a dream of a lifetime which was fulfilled, after watching the marvelous Mysore palace, which in itself is of a great historic significance,anyone who has not seen this marvellous palace at night would have definitely missed something in life."
218,Overwhelmingly Beautiful ,Just awesome place. Best place for family friends to visit and spend nice time with family and friends
219,It was an awesome visit,The main attraction of Mysore . Mysore palace is the most beautiful palace out of seven palace in Mysore located in Mysore central. Very beautiful palace with well maintained atmosphere. Parking food everything is available there. Mysore Palace is a historical palace and a royal residence at Mysore in the Indian State of Karnataka. Very well architecture work done by the people’s of that time. Palace will be mind blowing in holiday evenings after 7 pm because of the light works.One of the must visitable historical place.
220,Must do once!,"We visited on a Saturday and there were so many people, I've never been anywhere with close to 5,000 others visiting at the same time and it was overwhelming to say the least.The number of people aside, the palace is beautiful.  The architecture is unique and the paintings and tiles are beautiful.  I would recommend getting a guide though so that you can understand a little more of the history."
221,Beautiful palace with so big verandah and garden,Great palace guide charges are Rs 350 for 5 people photos are now allowed to inter area center of city shoes are not allowed entry fees
222,Incredible palace!,"Worth to visit by 6.30 for live music and lightingPlace maintained clean, don't drink tea worst quality"
223,A must,"Visited the palace along with friends & family on mysore trip,  the palace is huge and very beautiful from outside as well as inside. For tickets no cards are accepted only cash & i guess we need to have proper change available for the same. We need to deposit our footwear outside and then go inside the palace,  this is bit slow and time consuming as the counters are very crowded. Once inside the palace,  I suggest to hire guide which are available inside to get all the knowledge and to know what is what, some audio guide app is also available, but i didnot tried whether working or not.There are 2 palace in the premises, one is new and other is old wooden palace.  Overall good visit !!!"
224,better than expected,Small tour through the parts of the palace which are open for public. Interesting artifacts and displays about the royal family and Mysore's history. Guides are slightly overpriced. Audio guides equipments were not working
225,"If in Mysore, do try and visit",Definitely worth a visit. Don't bother going into the separate residential part as this is 3 times the price of the main palace for foreigners and isn't worth it. Be aware you have to take your shoes off before entering the palace and collect them when you exit.
226,Marvels in Mysore Palace,"For the common man  experiencing the life of royals,thanks to the democracy stepping in the same palace once only royals wandered. explore....."
227,Spectacular ,We visited a day after Dusshera. Crowd was manageable but there was no effort on the part of Authorities. Visitors were only interested in taking selfies. There was near stampede situation near the stairs. Also inside was very stuffy and suffocating in absence of adequate ventilation.These places are our national pride and must be adequately manned through professional agencies.
228,Mysuru Palace,"A enchanting residence of the Royal family of Mysore which is considered as one of the biggest palace in India.Visiting hours are from morning 10 until 1730hrs.It is very well renouned for its light show and especially during the biggest festival of Dasera. The Place is surrounded by spectacular garden making it all the more picturesque. Absolutely spellbound experience to witness royal lifestyle, their magnificent dresses, elegantly ornate rooms, the exquisite doors, striking columns, ceilings,If you plan to visit the palace in one of the Dasera days its truly an experience.Mind the timings to plan your visit to the palace."
229,Very disappointed..,The mysore palace situated in mysore is a mystic destination for peoples.this is an ancient memory of the tippu sultan.the construction of the palace is really outrageous.
230,Sunday visit,Palace was definately good but if you afe allready familiar with the palaces of rajhasthan this one will certainly not be any special only a particular section with a golden dome but the rest is average... And they also charge for different sections of the palace which is irritating.But it would be a delight for architectural and art lovers
231,Grand !!!,"It's place which is must visit with family and kids during vacation,its good to see such a beautiful art and antique props from the history, a great palace, a lawns, meeting Hall's of that era, a big golden palki with 80 kgs of weight, beautifully crafted wooden doors, floors, ceilings,"
232,"Stay a week, see it all!",We visited in the morning and the security allowed only the locals and forbade us from entering.What's the purpose of a tourist place when you can't even allow the concerned
233,Amazing!!!,"Over the top Raj architecture, lit by 98000 electric bulbs on Sunday evenings. Well worth a visit to see evidence of a former maharajah regime."
234,Magnificence personified ,"To visit the palace the visitor has to buy tickets. From entrance to exit you have to go in a set path only. The intricate wood work on doors, pillars and the paintings in darbar hall is the highlight. Photo is not allowed inside the palace premises.Visit the palace on week days to avoid crowd. The palace lighting is done on week ends at 7 pm."
235,A priceless heritage that could be maintained and displayed better,"Great place and beautiful works. Better take a guide or there is data storage device which which have audio clips for each and every item there. Cant take camera inside the palace.Foreigners get a free audio tour included in the entrance fee, which is worth listening to."
236,Must see in Mysore,"We had a great time enjoying the sunset over the Mysore Palace. Though being a Tuesday, we could only get a Kannada show for Light and Sound - but the whole ambience and the music was as grand as the palace itself. Currently English shows are between Thursday - Saturday and rest of the days are for Kannada shows. We could not visit the inside of the palace due to paucity of time"
237,3rd visit at Mysore Palace! Historical beauty and masterpiece!,A must see pace - try to go on a Sunday to see the lights but a tour of the Palace is a definite must
238,Must visit place,If you are in Mysore on a Sunday eveninbg this is amust. Its a bit of a scum to get though the gates but once inside there is plenty of room. When the lights go on its wonderful.Also the place is good to visit during the day. Very opulant rooms.
239,visited last winters,Mysore Palace is the official residence of the royal Wodeyar Family of Mysore. It's a wonderful example of the Indo-Islamic style prevalent in Karnataka. The exterior has a.lovely pink/red and grey colour scheme. The red/pink of the domes are exceptionally striking in contrast to the grey of the rest of the building. It's a shame photos inside the palace are not permitted because the audience and Durbar halls are very photogenic with their loved arches and unusual column designs.Well worth visiting in Mysore.
240,Nice palace,"Beautiful reminder of the wealth and grandeur of the Kings of Mysore. Very meaningful insight into the life and lifestyle of the Royals. The palace in itself is a lesson in the design and architecture of the era. I only wish it was better maintained. We went twice once during the day for the tour and again to see it all lit up with 99,000 bulbs on Sunday evening between 7 pm to 8 pm. The crows can be maddening and staff despite their best efforts cannot control the crowds. You have to take off your shoes and keep it before going in. There is an adjacent residential portion wherein the display of personal effects is put up."
241,Must visit in mysore,Wish they opened the doors that were accessible before but however we won't stop coming.  The Charm remains to dazzle the spectators And offcourse the lighting is Lit!
242,Just amazing. Great history lesson. Get a guide,"I rented a car and took a day trip to Mysore.   I wanted to see the palaces.   The first stop was the summer palace.  I paid for a personal guide.  However, I would not the next tour.  At the base of each display is an explanation  of the display and it's purpose.  Overall, the tour took about 45 minutes and it was very interesting history.   Next we move to the Mysore palace,  there were a lot of people and the lines were very long.   Do the audio tour and pay for the access to the golden casket.  It is worth the extra cost.   After visit a few more site, we did some shopping.  Great day in Mysore."
243,Visit to the glorious Mysore Palace,"If you are in Mysore then a visit to this place is a must whether or not you are a history lover. A walk through this palace will teach you a lot about the history of the Wadiyar dynasty of Mysore and its collection of paintings, artifacts and idols was appreciable. What I liked the best was however the cool architecture of the different sections of the palace. One thing I had heard earlier that inside the palace you were not allowed to take snaps but when I went in I found there was no such rule. People were taking snaps freely and the guards were also not stopping them. Also I would recommend people to visit this place on a weekday if possible as during weekends the place becomes too heavily crowded which might be a problem for many."
244,"Beautiful...Mesmerising Mysore Palace
(India)",I think Mysore Palace is less interesting than Udaipur or Jaipur Palace. I think Udaipur Palace is more interesting than Mysore Palace.This review is as per my opinion and my point of view only.
245,Centuries of Mysore history!,"3, 2, 1, Lights Up! That moment was magnificent. It was such a beautiful sight. We went to view it during day and night and both had it's own beauty.When we entered the palace, it was grandeur in it's own way. The place was massive and beautiful.The palace is a must visit! No doubt."
246,Nice to go through a palace well maintained,Our guide (freelance) brought the palace to life with all the details he gave us of its history. The other palaces and how they were destroyed. The architect who designed this one and all the different material.used from around the world. And the festivals and parades each year.
247,Historical place,"We were there twice during Dasara. Once inside and once for Jamboo Savari.While it’s very beautiful the huge crowds distracted from it’s beauty. People were packed solid both in line and on the tour path. Many displays were difficult to see.Once we got to our seats using our gold passes. Things were less crowded and the Elephants and a few of the performers were well worth the 2 hour line and a bit of sweat and sunburn. If you go for the Savari, bring lots of sunscreen and water."
248,A towering palce,15 years to build and cost 4.5 million rupees.Not my most favourite Palace visit.We had a guide which was great.I found the building and interior lacked any real quality.
249,"Mysore Palace, night and day","The Mysore palace is the most conveniently located tourist attraction. Just a kilometer from the Urban bus station, you can easily reach here on foot. The place has a ticket of Rupees 50 and that doesn't pinch you once you're inside the palace building. The sheer size, decorations, beautiful wood doors and the colorful pillars will amaze you so much so that you want to capture everything in the camera.The place is always crowded and visiting it during late evening makes it even more special because of the spectacular lighting all around the palace walls. I was still not impressed with the upkeep of the place and think that still so much can be done to keep the tourists more entertained and enthused."
250,Heritage city Mysore!!!,Beautiful palace. Lights at night were incredible they lit palace up for 1.5 hours . Wish people did not vandalize the walls Palace carving their name in walls which was obnoxious. Went during day and night to see it.
251,A good evening visit for Light and Show,"Mysuru Palace is the beautiful place to visit all it difference between bengalaru to mysuru karnataka, India"
252,The ancient memories of tippu.,It was our first vacation after we got job in Indian railways. Our pockets were full of money. We decided to go for Mysore and to book a luxury hotel. We decided to book Amba Niwas .It is luxury so pocket friendly.We were amaged to visit Mysore .Thank you Amba Niwas.
253,Very nice place,"We have visit this time night timing 7 to 8..palace fully arrange with lighting ...looking marvelous in lighting ., huge crowd on Sunday ...entry is free on Sunday...must watch the palace on lighting ..."
254,One of the best Palaces I have seen ,"What a brilliant place, that architect knew what he doing. Had a look round one afternoon then went back on another day for the evening laser light show and story of Mysore-recommended."
255,"Blend of Hindu, Mughal, Rajput & Gothic style",It is the best place of mysore city which is located in Mysore Central. It is one of the rich heritage of country. This is the one of the cleanest places of India. The design on the walls are so beautifully and uniquely designed.These walls not only adds stars on the beauty of palace along with that gives a brief about the ancestral culture of our country. There is also a temple inside the palace to visit. The palace looks more beautiful at the evening when all the lights are On that adds cherry on the Cake. The transport facility to this place is also very convenient.
256,"Way too many people, beautiful and a guide is a must","We went to the palace recently. We were five. Along with another family of five, we engaged a guide. Money was shared. Anyway, it is not much and we could have afforded all alone. But it so happened that another family was already there along side the guide and they were looking for some others to join. The guide asked if we understand Hindi and/ or English. It was OK with us. Then the journey started. It was really a fantastic experience. I never new that there is so much to see inside the palace. In a previous visit, we had not seen any of the things inside the palace. The family of the erstwhile king stays in one part of the palace and that portion is not open for public viewing. We had taken a round of the palace on road by battery driven cart before entering the palace.When you go to Mysuru, never miss this attraction!"
257,Excellent ,Just WOW. In awe of this place. I can only imagine how this would have looked back in the day in all its glory. It is crowded with loads of people showing up to see it every day. Tonga rides outside the Palace and Hawkers all over the place. Everything is negotiable. Find a good guide to show you around inside. The change for a guide is INR 350 for 1 hour for a 1-5 people. Definitely worth the money.
258,Historical Trip,"Well worth a visit, especially in the early evening when the palace is illuminated. I think Sunday evenings only."
259,absolutely fantastic,"Quite a good place to roam, should go to other side of the entry as well to get the front view of the palace. one can see the lightening on weekends and special occasion , its there for 1 hour"
260,Must visit!,"One of best and greatest archieture of India mysore palace is best and must visit , Beautiful palace and night view is best in world"
261,Never Expected This Good!,"Very nice place to stay in touch with your friends and family, but I have a good day. I'm a little more about the new York times. I'm a little more. I will be able to do with the new York City. I am a beautiful person. I am a beautiful person. I am a beautiful person to be the first one to two years ago and it is the most important part of the best way to the top of"
262,Stunning Palace,"Worth seeing at night but entry to palace closes at 6pm, be there at 4 pm. Viewthe palace and then lighting is worth seeing at 7:30pm. Also laser show is there"
263,OMG - So many people,Dussehra is really a good time to visit Mysore specially Mysore palace. The lighting in the evening in palace is simply awesome and eye catching. Also we really loved to see the lighting over all the city.
264,Superb night view,"Lot of rush while we went due to dasara festival, whole Mysuru is decorated with lights also the palace, it’s good to see."
265,Truely Amazing,One of the best place to  visit in Mysore. Best drive is to visit during dusshera days.The light show here is also must.
266,Beautiful but crowded and no information,It takes roughly an hour to view the palace on foot. Taking photos is allowed. You need to take off your footwear before entering the palace. The interiors are grand and they have done well to maintain it that way. Guides are available. Restaurants and other shops present in the palace area. There are camel rides available. Not sure about the charges. Its a grand view to see the palace illuminated from outside.
267,🌐History world,Wonderful experience. Entry is 70 ru and 45 ru. Kids below 10 is free. If possible avoid Saturday and Sunday. There was flowers festival going on when I visited. It's must visit place. Also do not Miss light show in evening.
268,Amazing cultural landmark,Sunday night 7-8pm lights will be on amazing experience to roam in palace music will be played by masters
269,Well maintained palace and Karnataka government show room Cauvery inside the palace.,"Illumination on special days is very nice, more valuable than Bridavan illumination,which are done at the same night time.Palace visit is good, if you are visiting first time."
270,"Mind Blowing, Must Visit.","Excellent - must visit during dasara festival (avoid last 2 days), go early, ideally after 130pm post lunch - take a licensed guide - they have std rates, but worth it if in group of 4-5. It takes about 2-3 hrs depending your interest - take a tkt to see the golden throne too, once inside the palace entry - must not miss). Stay on outside within the palace campus for the evening lighting ~ 645pm & for the cultural program if interested. Carry an umbrella as it can rain anytime outside.Crowd management could have been better by the police"
271,Mind Blowing,It is well worth a visit. Go during the day and if possible go on Sunday evening when it is all lit up  and is quite a sight
272,Trip,"I payed the extra to get a guide for the palace, and it made all the difference!  I learned all about the history of the palace and its architecture, I will say that i logged stairs on my fitbit during the tour, almost all of them in the sun, so be ready to sweat!"
273,Nice place to visit and the light show is a must see,This might be the 10th time visitng the palace. But everytime it's with different set of people's . Never felt like it's enough.
274,"Simply stunning !!!! Very well maintained, beautiful palace !","We took a guided tour of the Palace during the day and went back at 7pm in the evening for the English version of the Sound and Light Show.The inside of the Palace is beautiful, the architecture and decor is exquisite. Unfortunately the guide we had (cost 350 rupees) rushed us through and whilst imparting so e useful information we felt that we wanted to go back and walk through at our own pace. That caused a bit of an issue as we were going against the flow! Once you reach the exit you are supposed to leave. When we had finished the main Palace we went outside and found the old Palace and museum. This was an additional charge of 180 rupees per person. It was fairly small but pretty interesting.We also enjoyed walking around the grounds and discovered the Palace elephants The reason for the 5 star rating is mainly due to the Sound and Light Show which was excellent. At the end of the show all the lights were switched on. It was a real wow moment. The lights were on for 10 minutes - amazing."
275,Royalty at its best,"See this palace from outside in night, it's beautiful. Specially on Sunday, extra light are using which turned this palace more beautiful. A historical and royal palace, main attraction point of this city. It's different from other palaces in India. The architecture is magnificent and grandeur. Most beautiful place is Audience hall in this palace, bluish pillar and walls full of royalty. You need to 2 hour minimum here. Ticket price is Rs.70 for entry and for musuem Rs.50."
276,A palace - worth to visit.,"Mysore Palace is a historical palace and the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty. The palace is in centre of Mysore city. Mysore is known as 'City of Palaces' with 7 palaces including this one.The land on which the palace stands is known as Old Fort. Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, was burnt to ashes during 1896 Dasara festivities.Mysore Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than 6 million annual visitors. Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and his mother commissioned British architect Lord Henry Irwin to build a new palace. Meanwhile, the royal family stayed in the close by Jaganmohan Palace. The construction cost about Rs 41 lacs and was completed in 1912. The palace was further expanded around 1930 with the addition of Public Durbar Hall wing during the reign of Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar. Every Sunday, public holiday and Dussehra night its stunning to see the whole palace lit up for one hour from 7pm to 8pm! The palace interiors are also beautiful. Lots of artifacts, paintings, beautiful furniture are on display. Architecture & beauty of the palace is awesome.There are elephants,horses,cows,camels still at palace stables. There are many ancient temples also around the palace. Golf cart ride around the whole place is a good idea."
277,Visit only on weekdays,We finally took a weekend to visit and I timed it so we would be able to see the place lit up. The palace has many interesting details we learned about on our tour and it did make me curious about seeing it during Dussehra. We saw it on the morning when it opened and then went back for the lighting. This is a must visit when you’re in Mysore!
278,Great Place,"Mysore palace is one of the most popular palace since so many years. On October ""Dasara festival"" is celebrated there. it is nic to see the festival of Dasara there and also there is so many instruments that are used by kings on long time that are kept in the Mysore palace it is very good often to see that.if any people's goes to Mysore please visit the Mysore place.Thank you."
279,Best time to visit during dusshera,"Make sure to hire a guide, who will then hire an inside guy who will get you around the crowds. It is worth it to see the most impressive aspects of this palace without spending so much time in lines."
280,Heritage site,"If you stay overnight in Mysuru, make sure to visit night light show in Mysuru PalaceThe show narrator will tell you entire story about Mysuru Palace, so next day when/if you visit Mysuru Palace at day time, you will know already the whole history of this place, who lived in it, etc, so no need for a guide.Light show is running for dozens of years now, and it is still very spectacular.Palace itself is amazing, cannot believe it was built (rebuilt to be precise) in 20th century.Must visit"
281,A beautiful heritage that is worth a visit,Mysor palace is gud to come amazing artifacts. We seen seen such thing in hydrabad or here. Must visit palace in Mysore is the maysor palace. It is very very beautiful. Our day was gud here.
282,mysore palace,take a guided tour with one of the guides. available for 350. also take the buggy tour around the palace premises. total duration about 1.5 hrs. also do see the lights on holidays and Sundays at 7pm.ample parking. rickshaws tend to cheat.lovely things to see inside
283,Mysuru Palace,"I didn't visit the palace from the inside or during the day, so I honestly can't comment on it, but if you are a history buff, the palace tour should obviously be in your itinerary.If you time it properly, you can view the Light and Sound show immediately after visiting the palace.The L&S show is for 45 minutes, depicting the 400-year history of Mysore, and how the palace was built.There are 2 timings:• Kannada - Monday to Wednesday - 7.00 PM to 8.00 PM & Saturday - 8.15 PM to 9.15 PMTickets - Rs. 70 (Adults) & Rs. 30 (Children).• English - Thursday to Saturday - 7.00 PM to 8.00 PMTickets - Rs. 90 (Adults) & Rs. 40 (Children).The palace is also spectacularly lit up after the show, which is great for photo opportunities.Be sure to reach on time so that you can get good seats. The audio is good, so you will be able to hear the narration from any point, but seats right in front of the palace are the best.Also, reach on time because the L&S show is quite punctual."
284,Spectacular - wear socks,"The Amba Vilas Palace reflects the tastes of the Wodeyar family who ruled Mysore. We were told that the structure now standing is the fourth one to come up at the same site and has been made of stone as the earlier palace was gutted in a fire.The palace is grand and has many interesting halls and exhibits. It is wonderful to see it being lit up at night and on certain days the surrounding fort is also lit up. Magical !There is a Sound and Light show which is very well produced . They can do a few things to make it easier to purchase tickets in advance and also advertise the show timings more prominentlyThere is an App called Pinakin that is very helpful as an audio guide to the many points of interest in the palace .All in all, a place well worth visiting"
285,Good place,"This was rebuilt in the early 1900s after the earlier edifice was burnt to the ground. Some interesting architecture, but the old temples are far more impressive"
286,Good and worth,"Every Sunday at 19:00 the Palace is lit up with (they say) 100,000 bulbs, enter ace is free and the place is packed.    If you are in Mysore on a Sunday evening you need to go - it is truly astonishing.   The Palace is lit up, the South Gate is lit up, the East Gate and the North Gate as well........my best piece of advice is to get there at about 18:50 at the latest, snag a front row place against the railings and wait for the lights to be switched on at 19:00.   Very cool and worth seeing."
287,Old Palace to remember the life style of Kings.,Free to roam inside the arena but if you want to see inside Mahal then you need to pay Rs. 70 per head.
288,Great Palace...,"Rather than the inane monotony of ignorance, we had the brains to hire a licensed tourist guide. That guide Devaraja, took us to specific locations in the palace, inviting us to pay attention to particular architectural specialties,  rooms, decorations, inlay work, halls, doors, steps, photographs, paintings projecting optical illusions, painted all those many years ago ! ! !  For us all to understand, Devaraja switched between impeccable English and Hindi while explaining each delightful remarkable feature in the Palace. A tourist guide from Jaipur, Rajasthan once told me, the best palace in India is in Mysuru. Knowing something about Indian history and culture, I understand why."
289,Pretty average ,Huge... Beautiful... Well kept... Magnificent... Daily visit from 10 to 5.30 pm. Beautiful night light show on every Sunday and public holiday from 7pm to 8pm... Daily light n sound show in the evening. Check for days when it happens in English
290,Stays in ur mind,"If you are staying nearby, I recommend an early morning walk around the entire perimeter. There is a wide footpath, giant trees and glimpses of the palace to enjoy as well as an opportunity to admire some of the grand buildings across the road. You can go in and join the crowds later."
291,An attractive Palace,"Riches from all over the world here, Italian marble, French mirrors, gold leaf everywhere, tiles from Stoke-on Trent, all glorious. The King's elephants are kept nearby, but beware, high prices to go and see them! Ask how much first!"
292,Heritage walk ,"We visited the palace on the first day of our two-week honeymoon. It’s definitely the highlight of our visit to the city. The interiors are absolutely stunning (and very cool). Two recommendations: have the correct change for the place where you leave your shoes. We didn’t and they took 10 rupees, saying they have change - it cost 2 rupees per pair of shoes. Stay away from the big tours - there were several big groups of families and official tours which made it difficult to view everything. Keep away from them and you’ll have a better visit."
293,Main attraction of Mysore,Try to plan a visit on a Sunday evening to see the light up.  Glad we scheduled our itinerary for this.  We also visited inside during the day and the halls of the palace are stunning.
294,The large crowds spoil the fun,must visit place and it is build on those days without any machinery with purely on skills of human based
295,Visitors weren't allowed,"If it's hot, wear socks. You will need to check your shoes in and you will have a long way to walk in your bare feet before getting indoors. There is little shade to keep your feet from burning on the hot cement. They provide a strip of fake grass which I think is to provide a path to walk on, but it's just as hot as the cement. When you make it through, the tour is great. You can follow the arrows on your own and do the tour at your own pace. Could be more signs with information."
296,Only good from outside,Beautifully maintained.... good collection.... lights at night is fantastic...want to go there during Dussehra.
297,Worth visiting,"Mysore palace which was built in 1912 by Maharani Wadiyar  during the Wadiyar dynasty , is one of the magnificent structure  which we can see till date . The palace still belongs to the royal family and we can see half of the palace and it sure looks wonderful . It is said that the old palace was burnt during Dasara festival in 1896 and was re-built in 1912 . The architectural style is magnificent and unique , starting with huge garden at the entry and with marble domes and huge wooden doors inside the palace . Its a must visit during Dasara Festival to witness the celebrations of this event ."
298,Must See,"A bit crowded and hence be prepared to be pushed around a bit. Better to wear slip ons as you have to deposit your footwear while entering the palace. You have to follow the crowd but can choose to spend more time at the following artifacts/places: The Silver Visitor chairs, The Golden Throne, The Public Durbar and finally outside the front of the Palace.Unless you have too much time, you can almost skip the Residential area of the Palace."
299,Takes you back in time,Its good please if you are visiting mysore visit once at least. Best time to visit mysore palace is in night
