0,Totally Superb,"We bought the LFC tour in conjunction with the Beatles Tour which is at the Royal Albert Dock and bought together saves you money. The Anfield Stadium tour is a real must for every supporter of football, in fact I was the only LFC fan on my tour. We have been on the tour previously before the new stand was built and the new tour was totally superb. The new tour takes you behind the scenes of Englands most successful football club. You get to sit in both the Press room and the changing room and even touch the famous sign. There's lots of freedom on the tour and your not rushed around the stadium you'll get plenty of photo opportunities and a visit to the LFC restaurant makes for a wonderful end to the day, the food is really really good and very keenly priced, its that popular you have to book. If you book the joint Beatles/Anfeild tour and the restaurant I think they do a deal so enquire...!!!"
1,Amazing tour ,Great tour and we got the hop on tour bus who brought us here from Albert Dock and got a 10 pound voucher off the tour of stadium. Great day out with great photo opportunities for the Liverpool fan.
2,"Nothing like it (not even in London, sry Chelsea)",Had such an exciting amazing experience with my girlfriend we went on the anfield stadium tour and visited the museum as wellIt was great to see all the trophies stand in the stadium when it was empty to see how huge it was. Visit the dressing rooms and media/interview areaAbsolutely fantastic guide was full of information and tips
3,"Well organised, thoroughly enjoyable, Covid safe stadium tour","we done the tour in a sunday, liverpool played home on saturday.  tours were self guided with headphones.  It was a great experience with ample of time to go round, take photos and visit the whole stadium, next to the pitch, the kop, press area etc etc.  nice place and worth every penny £20"
4,Tour guide Terry is a legend!,"We had a great time visiting Anfield for the stadium tour for my sons birthday and his first trip to Anfield. Started with a few pics by the famous and New statues then into the LFC Shop. Had a good look around and he bought a new top with his birthday money.. Put it on over his other lfc top immediately.. Ha ha.. Then onto the tour itself. Alot has changed since I was there last time.. All for the better. An excellent tour up to the top of the new main stand then through to changing rooms an interview areas. Press room an other areas. An there is old big ears on the way too. Then onto the museum with all the history and trophies.. Plenty of them. Just brilliant..,and finally, a drink in the Boot Room. Carlsberg for me of course. My lad loved everything about it and my missus enjoyed it as well, our official picture taker. Getting there an back was no problem.. Train to Liverpool, breakfast in town, a trip to the Maritime museum on the Albert Dock, then the no. 26 bus takes you right outside the stadium.. Runs regularly every 10 minutes. All in all.. A very good day.."
5,Fantastic day,"Have done the stadium tour twice before but wanted to see the premier league trophy & the main stand. The tour guides Mike & John were very informative, helpful & friendly & I felt very safe touring the stadium & museum with all the safety precautions in place for covid. Despite having to limit the amount of people on each tour we didn't feel rushed & were given plenty of time to take photos etc. Highly recommend this tour"
6,Spectacular,"Booked a tour of the stadium for two as a Christmas present for my fiancé through virgin experiences, we booked our slot online and pre booked a two course meal also which was really straight forward to do.We live local and parking was easy and available and close to the stadium, it was half term and there was quite a few others around. For the price we had a great little day and got a few bits from the gift shop also, would recommend for anyone who wants a tour and self guided at your own pace with headsets."
7,Amazing tour,"I bought stadium tour and museum tickets for my husbands 50th birthday. We did the tour 11 years ago, and I’ve got to say that we enjoyed this tour so much more than last time we went. We had Terry and Dave as our tour guides and they were absolutely amazing. Terry was so enthusiastic and it really came through to our group that he was a big LFC fan. They both really made it extra special- even the lady who greeted us on reception wished my husband happy birthday (she must have seen it on my booking). Overall a really great  experience."
8, A great way to spend a morning,"The stadium tour of Liverpool football club was fantastic one of the best I've been on, the tour guy was very good."
9,Amazing,As we live in Virgil van Dijk’s hometown we had to visit Anfield. We enjoyed a great tour by a lovely tour guide. Nothing beats a tour given by a real LFC fan
10,Anfield,We took the tour of anfield we live local but never thought of doing it before we had a wonderful tour and thetour guide was very good we went into the changing  rooms and into the ground but your definitely not allowed on the pitch after the tour we went into the museum which is included in the price . We then had something to eat in the boot room restaurant that’s not included in the price of the tour that we done
11,The Best Christmas Present ,"We visited Anfield, as my daughter is a big fan, so we treated her to Anfield tour, (even though it was originally booked for the Saturday her birthday, we had to change it due to Liverpool playing a match),she absolutely loved it, and even though the rest of us were not football fans, I can honestly say, go! We enjoyed it just as much.The stadium has a very good one way system and plenty of hand gel station, where was also plenty of staff who were fully knowledgable with any questions we asked.Some parts are closed, but that didn’t change the experience.We brought our daughter the Bronze photo package, which included one photo taken with the trophy, we ended up upgrading to the Gold package which included all photos taken.You are able to take photos with your own camera/phone also.We spent just over two hours there, and I felt it was money well spent, in fact, I think we have become Liverpool fans also!"
12,Premiership Champions,"The stadium tour was fantastic, all Liverpool fans should visit.  Going to a game was magical and a 30 year bucket list item accomplished."
13,A must do,Myself my cousins visited the stadium on Monday in honour of my grandad Brian Jackson we was in the boardroom and it was fantastic the food was amazing everyone that works there was amazing something I will never ever forget thank you all for inviting us to join you highly recommend
14,Tour of anfield,"We booked an Anfield tour for the celebration of our son's 17th birthday - he's mad on Liverpool FC. His dad is Liverpool born and bred and although we live in Yorkshire he is loyal to his Liverpool roots. We arrived in terrible wet, stormy weather but were immediately given a warm and cheery welcome by the staff at the tour reception. Lots of jokes and friendly banter - there's a real genuine 'family' feel amongst the staff. We were a bit early for our tour time and they helpfully gave us our visitor wrist bands so we could visit the museum whilst we were waiting - this was really useful. The tour itself was so well organised and interesting - even to a football fan's wife. We had been on a tour here 10 years ago which was good but the tour has evolved and become even better. The tour guides Gordon and Mike were superb - so funny and lots of personal anecdotes - you could tell their genuine love and enthusiasm for the club and thorough historical knowledge. There were plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos in key areas and the background stories were fascinating and funny. We all had a great time and left with happy memories. It really made our son's birthday special. Thank you to the Anfield Tour Staff - especially Gordon and Mike who made it special."
15,Brilliant,Booked to do the Stadium tour as a Christmas present for my 13 year old son and it did not disappoint! We all had the most enjoyable day. The audio guide is great and very interesting. You go at your own pace but there are guides to answer any questions you may have. We spent 3 hours looking round and took over 100 pictures!Highlights were the dressing room and sitting in Klopps seat.Can't wait to return in March for the Liverpool Legends game.Thanks for a day we will never forget
16,Football and pint,"Did the LFC stadium tour where you can walk the grounds, visit the stands, dressing rooms and press room. You can also have your photo taken with a replica champions league trophy. Next to the stadium is the museum where you collect your photos and a huge LFC store in front of it where you can purchase all sorts of memorabilia. Even if you’re not a fan, you would be impressed with the set up. My wife isn’t and she was impressed with the Football club when she accompanied me and kids on the tour."
17,mr liverpool,"I did the stadium tour with my boyfriend. This was my first time at Anfield however my boyfriend has a season ticket so had been here many times, however had never done the tour. We were booked onto the 2:30pm tour. There was only one other family in our group so there was no overcrowding which was nice. We didn’t have to walk around with the group we were given, we could do the tour ourselves (as there isn’t a guide you are given audio guides), so we could spend as much time as we wanted at each section. The tour was amazing, we got to sit in the managers chair in the conference room, see the changing rooms, touch the ‘this is anfield sign’ and see the pitch. There are many of incredible photo ops, and the staff are helpful with taking photos of you too! You can buy professional photos at the end. 1 photo is £15, 2 is £20 and you can get pics and the digital version for £25. We also got to get a picture with all 4 trophies at the end of the tour. Overall I believe it was well worth the money for the tour and pics!"
18,Great tour,"Being a huge Liverpool supporter the stadium tour was a must and although I have been before, this time we were allowed pitch side and wow what an experience that was."
19,"Amazing Tour, Amazing Guide","My fiance and I did the Anfield Stadium tour and it was amazing. Beautiful, clean, well-organised stadium with knowledgeable and friendly staff. We enjoyed it immensely! This is a once in a lifetime experience!"
20,Amazing! ,"As a treat for my dad and my son (both big Liverpool supporters) I organised a day trip to Liverpool which incorporated the Anfield Stadium tour. From start to finish the tour was enjoyable, informative and well worth the money (£47 for the 3 of us). Ian was our guide and he made the tour fun with the help of the handheld screens (audio-visual guide). The tour took over an hour and a half but it certainly didn't feel like that because it was so entertaining and fascinating seeing behind the scenes areas such as the players changing rooms and the VIP lounge.The museum was also well worth visiting and it houses the Steven Gerrard collection. Our tour ended around lunchtime so we went to the Boot Room restaurant, which is located inside the grounds, beside the museum. Despite having a captive market we found the prices to be very reasonable and the menu was extensive with anything from burgers, pasta and pizza to fish and chips and a good kids menu. The restaurant was very clean, the staff were friendly and the food was satisfactory.We will definitely return someday, and perhaps be lucky enough to obtain tickets for a match, as I'm sure the atmosphere would be amazing!"
21,Great experiance,"We went on the tour in late December and really enjoyed ourselves. My boyfriend is a Liverpool supporter and he had an amazing experience, as did I, even though I don't know much about football at all. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly, which made the tour more enjoyable.We travelled to the stadium on the LFC explorer bus which was definitely worth it. We learned interesting information, not only about LFC but also Liverpool itself. We had the best time and would definitely recommend for all ages."
22,21st birthday treat ,"Special trip from West australia with my son to see Liverpool at Anfield. Train from London to Liverpool easy. The stadia and atmosphere is amazing, difficult to describe; before during and after game really excellent. We had wonderful seats and won. Difficult to get tickets and expensive but highly recommended. Never to be forgotten experience."
23,Excellent tour from a non Liverpool fan,"Second time we have done the stadium tour (family of 4). Very well organised (Covid), plenty of space to feel safe and well planned and conducted.Audio guides great, kept the kids interested and informed. You still get contributions from the guides on the way round and the scouse humour. Prior to Covid the whole tour contained stories and anecdotes from the guides, so thats a shame you done get the full scouse stories."
24,Worth a visit,"Seven of our walking group visited LFC today for the Stadium tour.  Steve, the guide was fantastic. He is a real LFC fan and his knowledge is immense. Please thank him for his welcoming attitude. When sitting in the COP we felt so nostalgic and even though Ive never been to a match I feel that I would love to watch the team play .Thank you Steve"
25,It's no man united,"Did the museum tour and it was amazing! If you are a Liverpool fan, you have to do it. The manager quotes, Stevie G’s memorabilia were just amazing. And you still could experience the players changing room, sit at Kop’s end — omg! It was surreal.. A must visit for the Liverpool fans!"
26,Premier League Champions 2019/2020,"As a huge fan had to do the stadium tour again !!  What can you say about this great iconic , historic stadium where dreams are made ... superb tour, great staff and a sheer joy and delight to be back at this amazing ground , home of the CHAMPIONS , love it #YNWA #JFT96 #CHAMPIONS . The tour is a must see !!!"
27,YNWA ,"Booked the tour online, which ensured we got a place as this can get very busy.The tour was fun, full of facts and we were allowed time to ask questions, take in the stadium and take as many photos as we could.On the latest tour you get to learn about the history of the club, see from near the top of the new main stand, see where the players walk into the stadium, go into the away and home dressing rooms, touch the This Is Anfield sign and walk out on to the pitch then over to The Kop."
28,Football heaven !!,"What can I say! Tour started with an introduction by a virtual Klopp. Excellent.  The stadium is massive,  huge! The guides, Lenny and Benny where absolutely amazing. The knowledge that they had and the absolute passion for the club came across hugely. Everything was fascinating and I don't even like football. Amazing experience and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Well done Anfield to you and your excellent staff."
29,Amazing Liverpool,I reluctantly joined some friends on a tour of the Anfield stadium but I’m so glad I did. It was extremely well organised and with the audio tour provided you can travel around the place at your own pace. Well worth a visit even if you’re not a Liverpool fan. It was extremely informative.
30,Stadium and museum tour,I’m not a Liverpool fan but spent a morning on the tour with my husband. A really informative and engaging tour and I’m an Arsenal fan.  Would recommend.
31,Amazing tour - thanks to John and John!,"We booked onto the tour as part of a weekend away for my husband who is a fan from a boy. Seeing all the statues, trophies and walking the stadium that he has seen only on the TV was a very emotional experience for him. We have great photos of the ground from all perspectives and an insight into the inner workings of the club. The staff were so friendly and entertaining and the tour was very well constructed to suit all ages and interest in the club. This was the perfect build up to watching a live match the day after."
32,What a great experience,"The tour gives an insight in the history of the LFC and Anfield Stadium and you can really feel the atmosphere while walking around, exploring areas that are not normally open to the public such as the dressing rooms. The staff is everywhere, ready to help, but I think they should be receive more training regarding accessibility. The man at the reception, in fact, didn't know what audio description (which is not provided) was and offered BSL. For a football club that prides in giving opportunities to people with disability, that is a big deal. I hope accessibility will be improved so everyone can really have the opportunity to enjoy Anfield."
33,Very interesting 👌 ,"First time I've done the Stadium Tour despite having been a fan for 43 years - it was a well organised experience, that both brought back some amazing memories (old and new) but also gave a lot of insight into the running of the club, Klopp's mind games with opponents (the difference between the dressing rooms is amazing!) and a number of personal insights from the tour guide. The museum was also great, with so many famous shirts, cups and other paraphernalia. A great couple of hours, at a reasonable price."
34,Great,"Very great stadium. Did the tour for £20 which entitles you to a stadium tour which includes home and away dressing room (best book a tour two days before a match there as they have to close off the home room the day before matchday). Staff were brilliant, tour entitles you to the Liverpool Museum which is a great learning area on older and current players. Would definitely recommend."
35,Mr Reid,"Oh boy!  This is special.The tour was excellent - lead by someone who has a real passion for the club and the museum was very good, not simply hagiography.  It was special to be in the changing room and to touch the Anfield side on the way out to the pitch (not allowed on it but do walk round it!)However what was really special was that I'd been given a ticket to the game.  I'd been before, admittedly in the away end, and you didn't get the feeling that the fans mattered that much; now: what a difference.  The first thing was the overall ground, it has really been developed over the past 10 years.  It still rises from the terraced housing but it feels as if it belongs.  The club has invested in the local community and there is a wonderful sense of belonging.The ground is now set in a plaza (before  it felt cramped).  There's a band playing before kick off, the super store is doing good business and there's a really relaxed atmosphere.  I've got a ticket to the main stand which entitles me to be in the 'Dug Out' pre match area. (One area - once you are in the this area, I was not allowed back out). Riding on the escalator up to the third level there's a wonderful view out to the mouth of the Mersey and across to the Wirral.  The 'Dug Out' is brilliant. Again, relaxed and easy going. Bars at either end but the kicker are the food stands, eat the world... all covered in the price of the ticket. I had tandori chicken burger - very good.Then out into the stand. Stunning, wonderful - building atmosphere which is released at kick off as everyone sings You'll Never Walk AloneYou'd have guessed - I'm a fan: I can't compare this to other Premiership grounds (last game was Spennymoor Town v. Northwich Victoria) but I was so impressed. I think the tour though will appeal to non-supporters too, as it does cover the social history and impact of the club on the local  community."
36,A Must do for any Liverpool fan,A must for any Liverpool fan. We did not do a tour this time as we have done a few previously. Still managed to spend money in the shop 👍and picked out a new hat
37,Cool tour!,"Recently had a LFC tour experience, Brilliant ! All the staff at the ground were genuinely welcoming, friendy & had typical scouse humour.The audio guide was interesting and informative, even to a dedicated fan. There is no rush to go around the full tour, so you can go at your own pace, with no pressure from staff to complete tour. 100% recommend this tour."
38,Excellent stadium tour.,Great day out with the kids and also very well organised by the club. We also found ourself messing about in the shop as well as the museum. We all finished the day with a meal I’m their restaurant next to the museum. Better food and service then expected. Thanks.
39,Quick stop off,We did the tour for Anfield and we were not disappointed. Although we were given a headset we chose not to use them as there were many guides around the stadium. There were clear markings on the floors for telling you where to go and the staff around the stadium were very informative however never made you feel bored. If I was to be harsh then I would say that it would possibly be better to see the Premier League trophy without having to get a photo took however the whole experience was great and it is a good value stadium tour.
40,Staff made the day,Great tour of Anfield with brilliant informative staff.  A must for Liverpool fans! Recommend getting the bus tour which takes you there on the hour and also brings you back.
41,A champion tour for a champion team,"This place was amazing, I took my partner for a surprise as he's a Liverpool supporter, and now I'm one lol seeing the football ground was the highlight! The tour guides where were lovely people who made the experience even better! I would definitely recommend anyone who visits Liverpool to see this place 😁 outstanding 👌"
42,Amazing tour,"I visited Anfield with my husband who is an enormous liverpool fan,  Being married to a liverpool fan its kind of hard to avoid it and over the years have found myself enjoying the matches and supporting the team myself.  I purchased the tour for my hubby for his birthday and he wasnt disappointed..we were taken into the players dressing rooms the press room and then into the tunnel and onto the pitch...WOW this took my breath away it really is spectacular! We walked onto the touchline and sat in the red chairs their were some great photo opportunities. As part of the tour you get entry into the liverpool hall of fame museum where all the trophies are displayed this was also amazing..loved every minute of it an absolutely brilliant day and fantastic value for money at £20 per person"
43,Anfield 20 tour,Absolute must for Liverpool fans I went with my husband I don’t watch football never mind doing a tour but I have to say I had a fantastic day so informative we were given hand held audio system and ear phones which talked us through everything from all the history to present day the tour guides were on hand to chat with and believe me they were very enthusiastic about the team and the stadium you go round at your own pace we went to the museum and also the Liverpool club store in the same area would definitely recommend a tour we also had a fantastic meal in the boot room we never booked but managed to fit us in worth it homemade cottage pie was lush
44,Tour of Stadium and Museum ,"We took our little boy to the anfield stadium tour and it did not disappoint!!!He was amazed and loved every second of it. It's detailed and takes you through the liverpool history, myself and my husband had been around ten years ago and it was great to see all the changes.Very helpful staff and lots to see and explore. Would deffo recommend!"
45,LFC tour,"We booked the trip via Klook.Easy to redeem at the tour counter with our mobile ticket for a wrist band Prior to the tour, a staff called Laura had emailed to inform us that the date we chose didn’t have a visit to the changing room. Luckily we were able to change the dates of our tour. Our guide was Gordon. Truly knowledgable and shared the info with such sincerity, pride and humour. He clearly adores his team and takes pride in the company he works for. My child is a Liverpool fan.I am not but I enjoyed the tour tremendously. The tour is about 1.5hours and you really get the stadium well including VIP areas. Go to the retail store AFTER the tour as they don’t allow large bags into the stadium. Worth a visit!"
46,The tour guides make it!,We did the stadium tour. Real value for money and lots to see and do.  All staff very friendly and helpful
47,A dream come true!,We have done the tour before but not for many years and the stadium has changed so much. The tour guide was very knowledgable and funny and made sure everyone was included and quite a bit of friendly banter involved. We finished off with a pre-booked meal in the Boot Room which was very enjoyable and a nice end to a very good day out. Highly recommended
48,I don't watch football and even I enjoyed it!,"My wife bought me a stadium and museum tour as a Christmas present, As we live 250 miles away and although I’m a big Liverpool fan, it seemed a long way with no game to watch......how wrong was I although this was tagged on to the end of a holiday, it is definitely worth the trip by its self.... the tour is lengthy and the guide fun and informative as well as being interesting and interactive Just make sure you have an extra couple of hours before or after, to walk around the ground and local area to se the murals and statues.....the museum is well laid out with everything you could possibly want to see..the tour takes in the new stand dressing rooms hospitality and press areas as well as the dug outs Photo opportunities with trophies and taking photos is also encouraged We spent over 4 hours here and could easily spent longer.  Unfortunately during these strange times the cafe/ restaurant was closed.  But still an amazing day seeing things you would not see on a match day.."
49,Amazing ,"We visited during the school holidays and it was packed, despite pre booking online the queues were huge. We stood in line for over 40 mins before getting into the building to queue to get to the desk and check in and then queue to get your audio tour.  The tour itself is self guided with a small screen and headphones that tell you about the different parts of the stadium. When we visited last time it was a week day and we got a guide to take us around which I think is much better, from the website it says these are still avail eat certain times.  You get to see the pitch and changing rooms as well as the whole stadium from the top of the seating area.  There is also a museum that gives you history of the team. It is a must see for any Liverpool fan but I would seriously consider the timing of your visit."
50,Great visit. ,"I dragged my wife to the stadium tour at Anfield for my birthday. She was dubious but did come along with an open mind. Parking was easy at Stanley Park, a short walk from the stadium. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the club. The tour utilised technology really well and took in all the key areas including the press room, changing room, the top of the main stand, sitting in the Kop and the dug-outs to name a few. Included in the price was entrance to the museum to see the trophies.Both of us really enjoyed the tour and spent some time in the massive team store. We also had lunch at the stadium restaurant. All in all a very enjoyable day. This was the slickest stadium tour I have done but was the first football stadium so not sure how it compares to other big football clubs.I would definitely recommend the tour to all but it is a must for any Liverpool fan."
51,"High expectations, Still exceeded ",Thoroughly enjoyed this tour.  Went by bus from Pier Head and our guide Oliver was brilliant.  Hugely knowledgeable and v funny.  Anfied Stadium tour was great too.  All the staff were really helpful and food and merchandise reasonably priced.  Definately recommend!!
52,Anfield tour,"Absolutely loved the match and Stadium tour was fantastic..paid £20 get to see all the highlights, museum is really cool. Cost £8 in a taxi from Albert's dock."
53,Great and enlighting tour,The tour was interactive and immersive into the history of LFC! My fiancée was a big fan as a LFC supporter!
54,Excellent Tour with Fantastic Tour Guide,"We took our 8-year old son on the LFC Stadium Tour in November 2019. We’re not Liverpool fans, but our son is currently football mad so we took him on a couple of stadium tours over the course of a weekend break.I must say we were slightly disappointed with the Anfield tour. We counted about 50 people on the same tour, which was far too many for one group. One part of the tour involved showing the view across Liverpool from the top of the main stand, where apparently you can see to Snowdonia in one direction and the Isle of Man in the other. However, being at the back of the large group, we couldn’t see anything. On trying to go and have a look at the view as the group moved on, we were told to move along and keep up with the rest of the group.Too much time was spent with the tour guide talking about how many times Liverpool had won the Champions League, describing every final in detail as we walked the corridors. This meant that the latter part of the tour, which was the bit we had wanted to see (i.e. the dressing rooms, tunnel and pitch side etc.) was very rushed. In fact, in the press conference room, many people were still queuing up to have their photo taken in Jurgen Klopp’s seat when the tour guides told us all to move on.Having been on a tour of Old Trafford on the same weekend (we’re not Man Utd fans either), I was surprised at some of the comments by the tour guide about how much Liverpool like to intimidate their opponents and make them feel very unwelcome. The tour guide at Man Utd was actually quite complimentary about Liverpool as a team - the same couldn’t be said about the Liverpool staff regarding Man Utd or in fact any away team!On the plus side, the views from the top of the main stand were great and the augmented reality viewing of a pre-match rendition of YNWA using the audio guide was very impressive. We also used the LFC City Explorer bus to get to and from Anfield and the lady who was our guide on there was very friendly and knowledgeable not just about football but about the city as a whole."
55,Best atmosphere in the world,I recently had a visit to the ground like so many on a day trip I joined the multitude of other fans who have never been to an actual match and can only see them on tv I did the full stadium tour but left half way through as when pointed to the famous kop there’s was a strong smell of urine so I had to leave so I do not recommend and I advise you to stay at home and continue to telly clap the team
56,Home of the normal one ,"If you even slightly love LFC, then yo should do this tour.Audio tour is great and the stadium is imposing, but the guides that you meet along the way really make it worthwhile. Have a chat and they all have something interesting to share with you.Loved it!"
57,still recommend anyone to go and see anfield,"Great for Liverpool fans and newbies alike. I learnt so much about the history of the club, saw all the behind the scenes press room, dressing rooms and walked out on to the pitch (although you can't touch the grass). Really cool insight into the club and would love to see it on an actual game now! Audio took about an hour but I definitely could have spent longer taking it all in. Got to take an official pic and a selfie with the premier league cup which was especially unique! Long lines to buy pictures (and quite expensive for one picture), as it was a busy day, so don't do this in a rush but otherwise a really unique day!"
58,Obviously a must go for any fans ,Cracking day at anfield it’s never a disappointing day here even better we got the winMy partners first live game experience she loved it and is now hookedWe had hospitality tickets it was fantastic
59,First visit ,Really great tour. Highly recommend whether your a Liverpool fan or not. Loads to see. Very surreal. The tour guides were great. Made it fun. Definitely do this tour. If your a Liverpool fan. It’s a must do
60,Brilliant tour made even more special following the league win! ,We went to see the new part of the stadium and it was good but definitely prefer the personal tours you got before. this one was very impersonal - last time we were taken around and it was the personal touch. Staff were friendly but it has lost its BOOM !!We talked to the guides who were as friendly as before and have great knowledge and enthusiasm - the new interactive tour was very muddled and confusing. Last time we were able to stand in the Kop this time it was cornered off and suddenly the tour was finished  - very disappointing  bring back the personal touch
61,Home of the champions,"I don't follow football so my review is totally neutral.  This is a brilliant tour, we spent 5 days in Liverpool so booked this in advance.   Staff are really friendly, ground is amazing and the tour guide was really funny and informative.     It's really interesting to see behind the scenes and hear all the facts.    Can't recommend this highly enough."
62,Fantastic tour,"The new build Anfield is really something to visit and watch a game of som good fotball, highly recommend it"
63,Great fun and memories,"Arrived ahead of the tour time so did the museum before we did actual tour of the stadium.Coffee bar/restaurant also open if you need a time out.Our Guided Tour was an pure gentleman, extremely interactive and very funny."
64,OUT OF THIS WORD,"Just as I love my Liverpool - Anfield is amazing - the stadium is terrific, the prices are good for food and drinks - absolutely ready for a stadium tour next time"
65,Champions tour,Brilliant even in these strangest of times. Definitely recommend Liverpool and the tour of Anfield. The tour guides were excellent.
66,The Place,"Purchased for my partner who is a die hard Liverpool supporter, he loved it.As a non football fan I was pleasantly surprised and also enjoyed the stadium tour and learning about my partners passion.I didn't enjoy the museum as there were too many people and my anxiety levels increased due to lack of social distancing. We didnt do the kop bar for this reason.Overall a good tour"
67,Birthday cusit,"We went to the stadium tour thinking we would be there an hour but 3 and a half hours later we were making our way to have something to eat in the cafe. What can I say a Liverpool fan for over 50 years and it didn’t disappoint. From Shanks to Klopp there was a lot to learn. The managers, the players, the Ethos of the club   Is just amazing. Well worth a family visit very reasonably priced for a family of 4"
68,To see liverpool win a great match,"My son and I went on the stadium tour last Sunday (the 2nd Feb). This was the second time I'd done the tour, with the previous time being pre-main stand development when the tour was with a guide rather than the headphones. And there's the problem with the 21st century football stadium tours, all very technically impressive and information-overload but missing those personal anecdotes that the grizzled tour guides used to provide.  It's certainly still enjoyable, but I for one prefer the old style....."
69,Stadium tour,Always a great tour 👍 visit the boot room restaurant it’s a must many photo opportunity’s at the home the most successful European football club in Britain 🇬🇧
70,Superb,"Amazing staff all round! The tour guide (Michael)  we had was amazing he knew so much about the club and its history and had so much time for everyone. i learnt knew things i didn't know, which i thought was amazing."
71,worth a look,Spent a few hours on a Sunday afternoon doing the Anfield Stadium and Museum tour.  It was really interesting and captures the spirit really well.  Lots of photo opportunities as well as an interesting insight into the history and current successes of the club.  Some great information around the museum.
72,Brilliant!,I recently went to a Liverpool game with my two boys aged 13 and 8.  The experience was something else from the band in the square to the Liverpool shop.  The match experience was fantastic and all the stewards/security were so friendly and helpful.
73,Exceeded all expectations ,"Had a wonderful time, spending 4 hours in total, having lunch at the boot room, museum, stadium tour and shopping at the megastore.Firstly, the stadium tour. Its professional done and i would strongly recommend that you don your liverpool kit for the occasion as there are lotsa of photo taking opportunity. Photos will look better with your liverpool kit on. Regular sized bags are allowed as well.As for the boot room, food are reasonably priced and delicious. Liverpool goals are played over and over again which makes the food taste better.The museum tour brings you back in time, old school jerseys as well as boots are on display. The highlight would be of course the 6 european cups on display. Lastly, the liverpool megastore store. Huge collection of souveniers but due to the crowd, you would be better of purchasing it via the liverpool city centre outlet.All in all, i had a great time, with sweet memories lasting for a long time."
74,Stadium tour,"A LFC for many years I finally made it to Anfield. Fan support volunteers at Lime Street train station helped me find the bus/taxi rank to Anfield. The thing i took away from my few hours at the stadium was the friendliness of all the staff - from security to store staff. Even with all the crowds they all had a smile on their faces and are very much ambassadors for the club as much as the players on the pitch. The museum tour is going through a redesign but was very interesting the quote from Bill Shankly about Tommy Smith ""he wasn't born..he was quarried"" will stay with me. Couldn't fault my experience. Not a speck of litter or dirt and in a football club female toilets - free female hygiene products which i was well impressed with. If you are a liverpool fan..indeed if you are a fan of football nothing will come close to hearing the Kop and the rest of the stadium sing ""you'll never walk alone"" acapella"
75,Day visit,"This was a surprise trip for my boyfriend who is a massive Liverpool fan and from the get go it was an amazing tour. Our tour guides were so involved, helpful and knowledgeable throughout making jokes and making the experience so much better than it could’ve been. The tour it’s self was amazing you get to see  so much of the stadium as fan would love! Including pitch side. Both the away and home changing rooms (brilliant seeing the difference) along with the Gerrard Collection, Liverpool museum and currently the Premier League Trophy is on display. Overall the tour was enjoyable afternoon for a non-football fan, would be perfect for a Liverpool fan there is so much to see and so much to learn and would happily go on this trip again.   Nothing better for a true Liverpool fan, getting to see such iconic parts of the stadium."
76,From Singapore to Anfield in 20 hours!,"I went to see Liverpool v Everton a few years back, it was my first ever match and the atmosphere was electrifying! We won 3-0! I then went to see Liverpool v Arsenal, wow arsenal fans are boring, we also beat them 2-0. I hope to buy a season ticket one day, Liverpool is like home to me."
77,My trip to anfield,"Had a fabulous time with my dad watching liverpool win yet another game of the season so happy to spend some time with my dad and enjoy it,stands where crowded and could not get any food at half time but was worth it!xoxo e.c"
78,Best football team in the world. ,"Visit Anfield was the best decision I’d made during my stay in Liverpool! Even though I am not a football fan and know basically nothing about it! The atmosphere was something what really got me:) You definitely have to go there when you are around, you’ll enjoy it!:)"
79,Bad,"Went on Sat 29th Feb to watch away game against Watford. This was my visit there. Took along a friend from Italy. Whilst the venue was clean and well organised - and easy to get served at the the bar ( Card only be the way ) NO CASH at bar allowed ! Place was freezing cold. I asked steward about this - who told me there was nothing they could do as it was in his words down to 'air ducts' in building. What ...I go to loads of venues to watch pop gigs , football matches ...never heard this excuse before .Also whilst there was plenty of screens there - you could hardly hear any commentary. Toilet was probably louder than anywhere here . So consequently little atmosphere. My Italian friend after  hearing all the 'Ballyhoo' around LFC was a little bit disappointed.  No wont be visiting again. There is a better atmosphere in my local pub ."
80,A day to see them play,"My partner and I purchased hospitality tickets to see pink starting with a 3 course meal in the chemistry lounge. The staff were fantastic, the food was amazing and the overall experience with a concert in the stadium was mind blowing"
81,Incredible atmosphere,Liverpool - Anfiled stadium tour so AmazingMust visit when in Liverpool.Very easy transport from city centre..
82,Great atmosphere but accessibility needs improvements,"Dragged the other half round this when we were in Liverpool for the day. Both enjoyed it and I can't recommend it highly enough, especially if you are a fan. Our tour guide (Micheal) was unbelievably knowledgeable. Everyone their was really friendly"
83,A Magical Afternoon in Anfield,"Did the stadium tour and was amazed with this world class club with its rich history able to blow one over, simply amazing and impressive;)"
84,Great tour,"Anfield is a special place, the ground has changed so much since the new stand was built and its aimed more for tourists now however still has the heritage around the ground. A must see for all tourists to Liverpool."
85,Stadium Tour,"Fantastic, warm and friendly staff made the experience a touch more. It's Anfield what more needs said."
86,A visit today:Wirral Walking group,"Another visit, after seeing my personalised stone again in the walkway,we took a few moments at the Hillsboro Memorial.We then viewed the new Paisley statue.Calling in the fab clubshop and spending far too much (lol) as usual.Well worth the journey everytime.An absolute must visit."
87,Terrible,Been to see Liverpool play here a few times. The atmosphere is brilliant. The staff is friendly and helpful. Love visiting the stadium
88,Great stadium tour!,"I took my 7 year old son on the Stadium Tour (a Christmas present to him) and it was excellent. Despite me being a Burnley fan, I found the tour fantastic and would definitely recommend. It's half guided and half self guided. Staff and various checkpoints are on hand to either introduce the next area or to answer questions - they are very enthusiastic about Liverpool FC as you can imagine and brought humour and knowledge to the your. The audio guide was really well done too - I'd say it was the easiest Audio-guide I've used, lots of opportunities to learn more or just dip in and out as you please. The view from the top of the new stand is fantastic, both inside the stadium and looking out over Goodison. Definitely recommend this tour. I'd also suggest you book as people without tickets were being turned away when we were there as they'd sold out. The club shop was very overcrowded and we struggled to find staff available on the floor to help us. The club shop at Liverpool One shopping centre on the other hand we found to be easier, so consider that if you have similar challenges with it being busy when you visit."
89,Liverpool tour,My wife and I completed this tour in September. We booked it through trip advisor and for a good price. Our guide was very gouge interacted with all of us and was quite humorous. We both got to sit in the boss’s seat on the pitch so that was a real bonus. Fully recommend to everyone who is a LFC supporter.
90,Good Day,"Was my hubby's dream to visit Anfield, home o this favourite team. The atmosphere was electric and we felt charged with emotion to be there. Taxis were a hell to get back to our lodgings, but a trip that was thoroughly enjoyed by us. In fact, plan to do this trip again  soon."
91,Fantastic experience ,Bought this as part of a 40th birthday present for my fiancee he loved it Liverpool die hard fan was well satisfied
92,So glad we didn't move,"An amazing dream come true for my son who got to watch Liverpool beat Leicester on the Saturday, experiencing the full Anfield atmosphere first-hand. We had the stadium tour on the Sunday and would really recommend, it was amazing to be there. Staff are so knowledgeable and passionate about the club. Recommend 100%."
93,A Football Fortress,"Totally worth the money. Got it all + friendly staff.    Come early, and try the boot room cafe for lunch, when youre done."
94,Mecca,As you’d expect it’s quite the spectacle. Lots of fans around all year around and particularly at this prestigious time. Nice huge fan shop over two floors with lifts. Didn’t do any tours as it’s lockdown but nice to walk around and Stanley Park literally next to it is very nice too.
95,Thanks.,For over 60 years I have visited Anfield stadium home of Liverpool FC and the magic of this sacred place continues to amaze me. I re call the very old Anfield as a small boy as i climbed the hundred or so steps making my way to the boys pen situated in the top corner of The Kop as we call it. Nowadays I am a season ticket holder and sit next to my son in a very prestigious seat looking down from the new Main Stand overlooking The Kop. Since the mid 1950's when Gerry Marsden got to the top of the 'hit parade' with the anthem from Rogers and Hammerstein Camelot we are treated just prior to the start of the game with a rendering of this charismatic song. You Will Never Walk alone rings out and tears can be seen in even mature folks eyes. This is am amazing sight and sound and sets the scene for yet another memorable occasion which will remain in memory indefinately. May this long continue ( ynwa).
96,The fortress in football ,A fantastic tight stadium with great atmosphere. The singing before the game give you goosebumps. Much better live!
97,Well worth a visit. Fantastic tour.,"Been on this tour twice. Absolutely flawless when we came the first time, we were given the tour in a small group by a guide. I wish I could remember his name because he was fantastic & we felt immersed in the LFC experience. Second time we had high hopes, but it was a weekend & we were surprised to find out the tour guides weren’t around, there were people everywhere wondering around with no direction and we were left with a speaker & headphones to guide us. Still fun but not the same as a savvy scouser sharing his passion as he takes you through Liverpool’s history."
98,A must visit ,The tour was adapted to the pace of individuals which is a very good idea. The satff throughout the tour was very helpful.
99,Always worth a visit ,"The stadium tour was guided by a device and a screen showing jurgen klopp welcoming you to anfield. It lacks the personal touch this huge club represents through out the world. No proper guides to walk you through the history of the tour, the club, the memories it has create."
100,Never walked alone,"If you're a Liverpool fan (but not only), this tour will take you through the atmosphere of this amazing club. It will show you the beginnings of the club, you will learn about the emblematic players and managers and the history of the stadium. You will have a chance to see the pitch, the stands, dressing rooms, press conference room and even the kitchen. You will have a unique chance to touch the famous Anfield sign and stay on bench on the Jurgen Klopp's spot."
101,Amazing,Pilgrimage for a liverpool supporter. Had the opportunity to watch the derby match as well. One of the best football stadium and game i have ever been in my life
102,Anfield ... nothing more to add ,"This tour is a MUST for every Liverpool fan visiting Liverpool, and even for those who are a neutral, this tour is AMAZING!!! Each and every one of the staff are a credit to the club, showing great love and enthusiasm for their job, and club. The tour was uncrowded, and unrushed, leaving a lump in my throat many times. I will definately be going again on my next visit."
103,Home of the Liverpool,Great tour around Anfield with my partner. Tour guides were brilliant. Could bot fault any of it. Xx
104,Fantastic experience!,"Went passed the Liverpool stadium on way to Sandon pub nice place 4 a pint good sports on tv,s nice staff good prices would recomend  this place to everyone,👍👍👍"
105,Wonderful experience,Absolutely  wonderful tour.Our guide Len was so knowledgeable about the origin of theFootball club and its fans   and his humour had me laughing from start to finish .Please visit if you want a real flavour  of Liverpool and its community.
106,What a Stadium!,We brought our boys away for a few days over half term to Liverpool and Anfield was our first stop and it did not disappoint!! It was busy with a lot of other visitors as it was half term but didn’t feel crowded as you walk around in so many groups!! We are huge LFC supporters and the stadium tour is a must to do if you are!!Reasonable price also for a family of 5. Your can easily spend a good few hours here! Bring plenty of money for the shop too!!
107,In Awe,Bought my husband a voucher for Father’s Day last year and finally visited over half term. He is a Massive fan and our daughter also is. He enjoyed the history and found the audio guide very useful. The tour was very busy as it was half term but we still really enjoyed it. He’s now looking forward to her being old enough to attend a match.
108,Anfield,My brother and I was at Anfield for a day visit I was toally amazed we were made very welcome by all the staff we went to the boot room for lunch excellent service from the staff could have stayed longer we got to see all the cups six would love to seen and meet some of the players but not to worry will be back again after this terrifying time we are all going threw next time we are over the league cup will be there God bless
109,Friendly staff ,Brilliant tour and really good value for money!  My only criticismwas they didn't have a Danish language headset which would have been great formy Danish fiance.
110,Absolutely brilliant,"We went as a family of 6 to celebrate my dads 80th birthday.  The whole experience is fantastic, the guides in each area so passionate, friendly, informative with many a story to share.  Each one a credit to the tour and an image of the manager in their interactions!It was great to be able to do everything you see on 'Inside Anfield', a must do for every Liverpool supporter or not!  Thanks the LFC stadium team."
111,Superb time,Visited Anfield Stadium to complete the stadium tour. Tour guides were enthusiastic and informative. Lots of opportunities to stop and take pictures. I visited before over 10 years ago and to see the improvement/upgrades/progress was impressive. Can't wait to visit again to see the Premier League trophy!
112,A place of worship,"Third tour here and it is always an exceptional experience.From the walk to the top level of the main stand, views of the pitch, press conference room, away dressing room, players eating area, home dressing room, this is Anfield sign, dugout and then The Kop. It is a prefect way to spend a couple of hours.Then the museum and down to view the Premier League Trophy. Wow."
113,Brilliant ,"I took the stadium tour with my son`s, it was great. The guide was brilliant, the information provided was both interesting and entertaining. YNWA"
114,LFC Forever,Went for a tour for my stepdaughter and husband who are both avid Liverpool fans. The day was excellent and well managed especially with all COVID restrictions in place. Everyone made a real fuss over my stepdaughter and the icing on the cake was getting pictures taken with the premier league trophy.
115,Incredible,First time staying in Liverpool had to do tour it was fantastic from start to finish would advise any footy fans to take time out to do tour
116,Visit to the 'Kop ' Bar at Anfield,"I am not a Liverpool FC fan but thought I'd visit the stadium as part of a long weekend. Overall the experience was fun; I get the feeling Liverpool FC is really the heart of this great city. Most football fans are sentimental but Liverpool take it to a new level. Impressive stadium.My only gripes was that it was self guided - it is a faff using the audio guide and I often found I had to forward or rewind it get the right area. You do miss something not having a real guide.Also, through my own fault, I completely forgot the Museum portion of the tour. I don't think it would have been too much for staff at the exit to remind visitors about the museum as they hand in their audio guides for those more forgetful people."
117,amazing trip,"Fantastic , brilliant atmosphere, great seats - This is Anfield . Had tickets for Dug Out Lounge, didn’t disappoint, good food, good service"
118,Anfield Stadium Tour.,Fantastic interactive tour around the legendary ground of the world famous footballclub Liverpool FC.
119,Fun filled and interesting ,"We were well looked after by tour guides as I have to use a wheelchair for walking distance and the tour covers some distance. So organised help to lifts and everything was amazing, but can’t say the same for The Boot Room Cafe ,waitress was lovely so helpful but first we waited ages for our meal ,then my burger was burnt spoilt what was a lovely day ,to be fare they did offer anew one but didn’t want to wait another half hour ."
120,A 4-course meal in the 1892-lounge before match.,"Went to this wonderful stadium tonight to watch Liverpool beat Everton 5-2 and what an experience. The stadium is breathtaking, there is an outside park with football pitches for children, live bands playing, food stalls, pop-up bars. There's view points to see the team coach come in. It's an American style atmosphere right here in the UK.I was brought along by friends as part of a business meeting (I support neither team) and I was not only blown away by what the stadium offers customers but what the stadium offers in terms of a show. Liverpool played some astonishing football and for once in many many years I can agree with the guys who took me who are relentlessly adamant that they're going to win the cup this year.Thanks for such a wonderful time!"
121,Unforgettable visit to the home of Liverpool Football Club.,"Great day out, my Granddaughter absolutely loved it, great to see the premier trophy and European Cup."
122,Dont hesitate and book it,As a Liverpool supporter this was great was shown around by a guide who was excellent funny and knowledgeable overall a must for fans. Had food in the boot room cafe/bar the food was really good pizza and Parmesan fries 👍👍👍
123,YNWA,"Wasn’t given what I wanted (a win away from home) and it was really busy with lots of tourists wearing Liverpool scarfs who didn’t speak, let alone sing. To top it off, I left the ground and found my car with no wheels on."
124,Fantastic,"Excellent tour with a fantastic, knowledgable guide whose passion for the club really came through (think his name was Jason)"
125,Anfield is great,"For a football fan, Anfield is the ultimate venue.  The city of Liverpool is welcoming, the stadium is first rate and the Reds are World, European and soon to be League Champions.  YNWA"
126,You will never walk alone,"going around on the fab tour for 2 hours at the home of the world champions , you are given a video to watch with headphones attached to see the best moments of liverpool football club , a tour guide goes around with the group , you get to see , home dressing room , away dressing , the dugout , trophy room , the museum  , the pitch from the sidelines  , of course the one and only kop + photos with the recently won premier league title with a player or manager of your choice."
127,Definitely a Must see... YNWA!!!,If you are like my partner and have never been on the LFC tour then do it.!  This was something that I booked thinking I wouldn't enjoy it much but that as it was something my partner had wanted to do (but had never got around to) for many years then I'd just have to go along with it.I have to say that the experience was fun - Liverpool Football Club is really at the heart of this wonderful city and this tour rounded off a great romantic weekend for us.
128,Great atmsophere,"I’m a season ticket holder sitting in the Kop. I have went to the match since 2015. Ever since the Main Stand was replaced, the atmosphere improved. The steward will give their absolute all to help you in any way. The only time I’d not want come here is if I support an opposition team!"
129,Heaven,Lovely 3 hours. Lots of history and brilliant knowledge from the tour guides. Not just for Liverpool Fans.
130,A perfect stadium tour,"Following Liverpool up and down the country; weekends away, singing the songs and having a few beers is what I enjoy most but my neighbour had a spare for the Everton game.Great to be back at Anfield though, seats in the main stand, looking down on the Kop, perfect. Season ticket priced seat would be £47 and at the moment, with the football being played, worth every penny.Good camaraderie around our seats, my friend has built a good rapport with those sat around him, like on the Kop when you used to stand in the same place.Parking is at a premium with residents parking in most areas or private arrangements charging £7-£10 from what I could see. My friend knew a place to park for free and we went in The Saddle pub first, £2.80 for a Guinness, a lot of shouting between a group of fans but I think they were friends! I couldn't tell you which pub to go in, none of them really stand out.The facilities in the new stand are excellent and a real eye opener if you've visited Palace and Burnley this season.Great atmosphere and luckily for me we scored 5 against Everton as I was in the Park End the last time we scored 5 against them.A great night out."
131,Well looked after.,"Visited this with my 12 year old son. We are both Liverpool fans so we might be biased but what a great experience. We did the stadium tour and museum. Loads of parking and free - we used the Stanley Park car park and it was a minute or so to walk from there.You get a smart screen guide that describes the tour and you can keep the headphones at the end of the tour but there are guides to help whilst you walk around and follow the route, overlooking the pitch from level 6 and then down to pitch side to sit in the dug out.Loads of photo opportunities including the champions league trophy and PL trophy.My son described it as the best day of his life. I enjoyed it as well. 🤣"
132,"Booked for partner's birthday as he'd never been, (he) thoroughly enjoyed it!",We visited anfield on a very wet and cold Friday afternoon. The tour itself was very interesting and our son was mesmerised. He loved the life sized cutouts of the players and seeing their jerseys in the changing rooms. I found the Hillsborough tributes very moving. Absolutely loved it even my husband who is a United fan. The museum is worth a visit and lots of collectors items on display in the shop.
133,Stadium tour,"We visited with friends who had came from Sydney Australia who had an interest in the club and had wanted to see a match, unfortunately the ‘internationals’ were playing so Liverpool had no home games at the time - so we came on the tour instead.Danny the guide (and Mark his colleague) was excellent. Of course the ground is  impressive, but Danny certainly brought the Club and its history to life - his knowledge, enthusiasm and passion was second to none. We loved our visit and certainly our visitors rated it as one of the best things they did on their stay in the UK"
134,A dream come true ,"Wow what a visitHusband has been a lifelong Liverpool fan since age of 7 and we finally managed this trip for him before he turns 50 in a few weeks. What a fab tour. The audio guide is great but the tour guides dotted around have amazing and passionate stories to tell all along the tour. Our girls, who are not big footy fans, loved it and loved watching their dad indulge in his love of Liverpool. Could not recommend this tour more. The look on my hubby’s face when he saw the pitch and to touch the anfield sign and sit in the cop. That will last a lifetime . Thanks Anfield"
135,The dressing room,"Great place even if you are not a big LFC fan. I have visited Anfield before for a tour, we had a great guide, who talked about LFC and Anfield with passion. We returned to Anfield for LFC vs Brighton game. And once again a lovely experience and atmosphere in Anfield."
136,Generally Very good,Went around the museum with friends from abroad  who were disappointed as they felt that all that was wanted was to get them in to the shop to buy overpriced items.
137,Crowd Pleaser!,The mighty reds. Excellent tour of a fabulous new modernised stadium. A must see tour and museum with a new fantastic club shop
138,Dressing room visit was a blast,"Best football experience ever - the history, the feel of the stadium is just totally awesome. I’ve also visited the Etihad and Anfield is miles, miles, miles ahead of it.First - the staff. Friendly, enthused and so very welcoming. Then the facility - state of the art, modern, bright and just so special.I’d recommend this to everyone .. especially Manchester United fans. YNWA!"
139,A must for Liverpool fans,Excellent tour of Anfield and a picture with the Premiership trophy to boot.Beautiful stadium and loads to do outside as well.
140,Exceeding expectation!,"A brilliant experience, value for money a true love for the club was present throughout the tour. Perfect for any and all sports fans."
141,Fabulous experience!!,Really enjoyable. Brought my two sons aged 7 and 10. They loved it - best day ever etc. We booked a tour for 2.30 stayed until closing time. Could have stayed longer - definitely worth the time. Even the good lady football hating wife enjoyed it....
142,Tour ,"I'm not a fan, but took the opportunity to go on the Anfield Tour. You are given heZdphones so that you can listen to and find out the history of the club as you go round the tour. You get access to the changing room, press area and get a fantastic view  from the stands. I sat in the dug out and the Kop! Had a fantastic time,"
143,Feb 2020,"The tour was very good , the scale of the stadium was impressive and all the aspects that we expected to see were there and easily accessible. However , despite the fact that we were told that there would be ample opportunities to take photos , we both felt that one of our tour guides was rushing us trough the tour , telling us to hurry up when we had waited our turn in the Press Room and the changing rooms - this did spoil our experience a little , and did detract from the overall experience."
144,Anfield Stadium,"What a fantastic tour ,I've done many stadium tours but this was by far the friendliest most informative tour I've ever done yes I'm a Liverpool supporter but it was the first time I've been since the new stand was built, and I was very impressed . Well done to the staff and organisers ."
145,Amazing!!,"Saw alot value for money , people with mobility problems are looked after by staff .if you go on tour and you have same there is a lift that staff are happy to guide you to .Terry who was our guide very knowledgeable about everything ."
146,Well worth it!,Matchday at Anfield - can't beat it. Fabulous atmosphere. There is even entertainment outside prior to a game.
147,Great Tour would recommend,"I travelled to watch a game and although tickets are hard to get hold off, it is very much worth paying the inflated online price for the experience of watching a live game."
148,second visit great stadium but missed the personal touch,"Went to see Liverpool -West Ham match.Entrance swift passage and well organised. Quite some drink and snack facilities. All very clean. We had a seat 5m from the corner flag on row 4, brilliant view on the players and pitch. An incredible atmosphere, Liverpool people carry the team on their hands!!"
149,Great trip,Loved the tour through the stadium. Not much of a football fan but the children did enjoy it. Done and ticked off
150,Nice tour,"Me and my boyfriend just popped by the stadium to have a look and go in the megastore. We spotted the stadium tour was open to decided to have a go, it was fantastic! So we’ll organised and everyone was socially distanced, our tour guide, James, was fantastic! He had a passion for the club and had a wide range of knowledge about the club! Would recommend for any Liverpool fan, or football fan!"
151,Was for my sons birthday,"A wonderfully organised tour, which felt safe and well thought out with safety being made paramount. Checking in to the stadium was easy and the group numbers are smaller now, which made it even more enjoyable. The tour guides were extremely knowledgeable and very inclusive. Would recommend this tour as a must for all LFC fans."
152,Liverpool Anfield Stadium Tour,Was a great part of our trip we went over for a match and done the tour the day after very friendly tour guides there highly reccomend
153,A must see fr any football fan,"For everyone who loves football and Liverpool it s a place that at least one in life need to be visited. The spirit, the people, the music and athmosphere, the fans, the Kop it s remain for sure in memory and even if you don t like football you ll definetely start to love this club."
154,Excellent experience for the whole family,"Took my nephew for his birthday and must say what a great tour and museum visit. We spent about 2 1/2 hours there walking round and looking at our own pace, we could have spent longer but we had arrived on the hop on hop off bus and the last bus back was 3.30 P.M which we had to get.For the price the tour was exceptional value, the staff were all friendly and answered any questions. My nephew loved it especially seeing the dressing room and sitting in their seats, as a non Liverpool fan i also had a great time.Trying to get tickets for a match is impossible so this is the next best thing. Go see for yourselves i'm sure you won't be disappointed."
155,Amazing ,"Well organised tour route inside the stadium. Knowledgable and friendly staff. Lots of history. Had an excellent time there, recommended!!!"
156,Check the best club in the world,Fantasic venue with incredible atmosphere and amazing history. This is a special place for any football fan and welll worth the trip
157,Field of Anfield Dreams,"Excellent stadium tour experience, loads to see and listen to (audio guided tour) lots of atmosphere created and history retold....would highly recommend if a LFC fan. Also took on the museum which was great to see the Gerrard exhibition. Took advantage of fixed price lunch in Boot room. Food was excellent quality and value"
158,Fab !,"My family and I come from Denmark, and we are all LFC fans - my husbond, daughter 18, twin boys 15 and I. We went to Liverpool for the weekend for the first time and saw Anfield for the first time also - incredible. The LFC tour was fantastic, the staff was so helpful and full of humour. It was amazing to see it all - the view from the sixth floor, the dressing rooms and the pitch side. It was just PERFECT!"
159,Interesting trip,"What a time for the reds . Much improved stadium. Seating in the ground for my son to small ,I.e he has  long legs and he struggles due to the space between the rows. Apart from that happy days."
160,Only after money,"Football,story,history,view-all in one.I am not fen of Liverpool club but I am sport person and was very impressed of Anfield Stadium."
161,Stadium Tour,"Football,story,history,view-all in one.I am not fen of Liverpool club but I am sport person and was very impressed of Anfield Stadium."
162,Dream come true,"My son and I attended the match against Sheffield United on 2 January 2020. An exceptional experience for a lifelong supporter from South Africa. The staff and stewards were all exceptionally friendly and enjoyed their jobs. Everyone had smiles on their faces. Our entire experience from the Shop to mingling with supporters before and after the match, the match itself and the stadium tour was out of this world. Can’t wait to go back!"
163,Wow what a tour,"Great history nice people doing great job ,greatest football team in UK maybe even the world only negative bought a photo of me and wife with replica leuropean cup in an old holder that didn't include the 19th league title or world club trophy on it a wee bit disappointed as been a fan all my life"
164,Fab,"Haven't been on a tour since the new stand opened. I've worked for the club for ten years as a steward so it was nice to see parts I don't get to see on a match day.Michael was my tour guide and a fantastic guide he is too! No script, you can tell everything comes from the heart. I had goosebumps and tears - he absolutely made my day. Loved learning things i didn't know. Total credit to the club! ❤️❤️"
165,Brilliant!,"Wow this is how you do it . What an experience every time I go. Amazing atmosphere, electric entertainment . This is how it's supposed to be done their neighbour's should take notes."
166,Fantastic experience ,"Bought as a Xmas gift for my hubby, daughter and father in law, they really enjoyed it, and would go again."
167,The worlds best team,The tour was absolutely amazing. Really enjoyed it! Donna the tour girl was very funny and informative.
168,Stadium tour... AMAZING!!!,"Great experience made even more enjoyable by the guides James and Billy, both were very friendly and professional throughout the tour with great banter between them. You can see the love they have for the club."
169,Match. Liverpool vs Wolves,Stadium Tour Museum & Premier League Trophy Exhibition. Tour was great could do at own speed with headsets and staff was very friends booked this for kids birthdays trip had a lovely time hand cleaning all over and social distancing marking on the floor a lovely time wasnt rushed in any way got the gold photo package was great 3 pinted picuters and then all other pictures you could download son premier league trophy  line went down quick and shop had no que only down side was the weather very wet so didnt spend much time down at pitch would do again. Parking is free but only on non match days i dont think can park there on match days all staff was very friendly and spoke to kids my daughter is 14 and son is 9 was great for both of them loved it and cant wait to come back
170,Anfield Magic,What a great tour. Terry brought us around and made the whole experience brilliant. Highly recommended this tour.
171,YNWA,"Great tour well guided. Very safe with masks on guides and well sanitised route. Both a history of the managers, the kop but also some experiences by video such as singing on match day. Good museum and exhibits too. A must for any true football fan."
172,"Liverpool 2, Wolverhampton 0","What a great experience to see first hand how everyone involved in  Liverpool football club play a valued part in making it work. Although the tour is done in fairly large groups there is plenty of time and space to make the most of it. The stadium itself is amazing but the opportunity to access areas not usually open to the public is a real privilege. It’s inspiring to see the way the club is run, the attention to detail and the pride and commitment from everyone regardless of their role."
173,Anfield tour,"What can I say, every Liverpool fan must visit Anfield at some point in their lives. It truly is a special place."
174,Fantastic for a true fan,"I have been a lifelong supporter of the team and visiting the stadium was something I had dreamt of doing for such a long time. Unfortunately, I have mixed feelings with regards to my tour. First, the best bits- Seeing the pitch in all its splendour, the dressing rooms (not replicas- the real ones) and the stands helping envision past and present glory does make the trip worthwhile. I’d probably do it again just for the experience.The day I visited may have been an aberration but the tour itself was very poorly organised with large crowds herded like cattle from one stage to another. The bloke handing the audio guides had to ask me if I understood English- which is okay, I get asked that often and I don’t mind it but it was quite humiliating for me when the white gentleman next to me was greeted with- Ah! You are definitely English! I almost felt less welcome in what I considered my football home. This was just one person and I am convinced it does not represent the culture of this club which I am proud to continue to be a fan of, but the club would do well to stay true to its core values and not try to merely rake in the moolah which is bound to follow the club’s recent and what I hope will be continued success."
175,"Briliant tour, well worth the money!","worth every penny , clean , friendly staff and very knowledgable , the whole day was great we had a 3 course meal which was lush , dont hestitate this is great"
176,Best stadium,"Been there twice before and it's amazing!Not alot of space in the seating area, but for me it's a part of the experience.Can also recommend Reds Bar during the match. You need to pre-book for that."
177,What can I say!,I have been there to watch some exciting football on numerous occasions and the people and staff are very friendly and helpful. The transport to the stadium is not the best however it's less than 3 miles from Lime Street train station. You can also catch the bus 917 which is direct by St John's Lane to the ground very frequently.I am hoping to go on the official Liverpool Football Club tour this year.
178,Horrible,It was the first time for me to experience this tour. Had always dreamt of coming to Anfield. Dreams do come true.
179,Lovely experience,We had Kenny as our tour guide and for us he made the tour all the more enjoyable. Kenny's passion and enthusiasm for the club really shone through. His approach is make the tour as enjoyable and memorable as possible so by the end you have the same level of passion and enthusiasm for Liverpool FC as Kenny has. Really enjoyable tour with a top tour guide.
180,Anfield legends tour,"I'm a LFC fan and always have been It's a great city with a super reputation.My other half bought this for valentine's day I last went 7 years ago This time was to see the 6 big ears and the world club trophy and the Stevie memorabilia in the museum.The stadium is huge, massive, a cathedral of a place that can be seen for miles.The amount of different nationalities that visit is not surprising.You get to see all the behind scenes that make the play tick and the view from the sixth floor looking out across the city is impressive Then take a look at the  view on to the pitch and even Virgil would look tiny You make your way down to the pitch side and look up and wow and that is where it hits you just how big this stadium is It was a great day given the humour of the staff made it even better"
181,Almost A religious Experience!,took my dad here as he's a huge fan.he was thrilled with the tour and museum.he got photos and we bought some bits in the shop.it's immaculately clean and tidy inside and out.great day out and worth every penny.
182,Pilgrimage!,My girlfriend surprised me to a trip to anfield and have to say I’m more a fan than ever. place is amazing beautiful pitch and very clean !! Each staff members we chatted to were amazing and very helpful 👍 the tour and museum was outstanding ❤️ love the place it’s a must see even the girlfriend which wasn’t a fan I’m glad to say we have another red supporter
183,Good but missing the personal anecdotes,What can you say it's the bees knees. Lovely restaurant and food great experience. Love going there.
184,Nice Tour around the iconic Stadion,I don't watch football and have no interest in it but accompanied my son and partner on the tour.  I was expecting to be bored and hate it but I actually really enjoyed it.  All of the guides were knowledgable and friendly and had time for my sons 101 questions.
185,Anfield stadium tour ,"Amazing tour, booked for partner. He loved it. Took our little one also, so very easy with children. Could not complain. Was our main highlight of our trip to liverpool."
186,very nice,Don’t normally enjoy this type of thing - but this was Fantastic.  The audio tour was clear and informative.
187,Liverpool,"We visited with 2 kids and my wife, had a fantastic experience, the tour was extremely engaging and both tour guides John and John did a great job to keep us all energized throughout the tour, very enthusiastic guides and we would like to thank both of them for such an unforgettable experience!"
188,Impressive Stadium,"A lot of history. Easily accessible (No. 26 or 27 bus) and the tour is very worthwhile. There is some building work around it, but if you are luck enough to get a ticket, there are few experiences comparable to it"
189,Stadium tour,"We took our son to take the Stadium Tour for his birthday and all I can say was it was the best birthday ever. Arrived at around 10 a.m. and went to the club shop...simply fantastic. Everything a Liverpool fan could desire. May our way over for the audio tour at 10.30 a.m and everything went like clockwork. Very warm welcome on arrival. Went around the stadium, pitch side, changing rooms, restaurants, club museum, back to the shop and much much more. We stayed around 5 hours on site, and could have stayed longer. Cafe in the club shop offered a welcomed break. If you are going, just have plenty of money for the club shop..not because its very expensive, but you will just see lots of tops, shirts and memorabilia for sale that you won't want to walk out without buying a shed load of gifts! Highly recommend."
190,Amazing ,Don’t even know where to start.I am a die-hard Liverpool fan and I could barely breathe with excitement! My partner is one of those boring ones who doesn’t support a specific club but even he got emotional!Our tour guides (Kim and ooooops) were outstanding. Their passion was beyond amazing and the tour is reasonably priced and is perfectly thought of! Only thing extra I could have wanted was to meet Salah and stay there forever.Thankyou!!!!
191,A must see for all Lfc fans,"Went on 7/8/20,Was a great experience,The guide Lenny was very knowledgeable he made the tour.Would recommend anyone to go excellent value for money"
192,Needs more than 5 stars!!!!,Went on a Stadium tour and museum tour as a family of 4 and had a great time. Kids enjoyed the interactive devices we were all provided and got to see just the 6 European cups 😉
193,Too little communication,I went to the game between Liverpool and Arsenal. Liverpool won 3-1. It was the best atmosphere and football I've ever seen.
194,Anfield tour,"Everything was absolutely brilliant. Starting from the organization team where the team is always around and willing to help, to actual experience. Very well organized, great insight into the history of LFC and Anfield Stadium,  Fully recommend! Lunch with stars was 5 star experience too."
195,Very Good Tour,"Fab place to visit for a true liverpool fan. Knowledge of tour guides is brilliant, tour is insightful,  really good way to spend a day in liverpool."
196,Making Memories with my son .,"The best football atmosphere in the world.It’s not the biggest, nor is it in a hotspot, but for a pure football experience, wow!"
197,No cuckoo clocks,"Outstanding place superb food in the Shankly lounge, if you ever get the chance to visit this place go for gold you won't be disappointed..."
198,Unforgettable experience for a true fan,"Took my 9 year old football mad Grandson and his Aunt and Uncle for his birthday treat. Not really having any interest in football I enjoyed every single minute of our visit. Being deaf I was delighted when I was given a tablet with the tour in sign language and subtitles. The views over the surrounding city and the river from the top levels were stunning.The stewards were all so kind and interesting and patient with a 9 year olds questions.  Never thought I would be excited to sit on the Kop. Wonderful photo opportunities throughout the tour. We ended up in the Boot Room Cafe, we food and service were excellent. Whole stadium was spotless throughout especially the loos. Would recommend this tour 100%"
199,Brilliant Experience ,"First visit to Anfield. Life long fan and took my little boy. He was amazed at how amazing the place was. We say trophies, dressing rooms, the kop etc. Excellent day!"
200,Tin pot ,"Being a lifelong Liveprool fan, I am finally able to visit the stadium of my dreams. Taking an extended couple of days from my business trip in London, I hopped onto the train from London to Liverpool Lime Street Station.Making my way to the fabled stadium was nerve-wrecking, with the butterflies in my stomach going in hyper-drive. As my guide told me, any first-timer to Anfield, their eyes will be start to water. AND IT IS TRUE!! My eyes were watering as I walked towards the iconic structure that has seen many legends passed through its gates. Looking at the world famous Shankly Gates was a memory that I will never forget.Making my way into the stands, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rising at each step that I took towards my allocated seat. Settling into my seat and belting out the famous ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" at the start of the game was simply breath-taking (the singing sure took its toll together with the bustery autumn winds from the coast).The stadium gives you a feel of history and what to expect for the future. It is definitely a good mix of the new and old. The closeness between the seats made the atmosphere magical and its a must visit for all Liverpool FC fans."
201,Walk Through Football History,Fantastic place love the team and Klop hope to go back soon ❤ Anfield unreal and the hospitalety so good ❤❤❤
202,Great experience,I dont do football but booked this as surprise for my husband. Really enjoyed it. The staff made it. Omg so friendly and up beat despite the cold and torrential rain. Very reasonable price too.
203,Avoid at all costs,"Fantastic tour full of humour and brilliant seeing all the trophy’s not a cuckoo clock in sight , soon see premier league there"
204,A Ground Fit For Champions!,"Changes from the previous year due to pandemic, Staff informed us of changes like they can't take the photos for us, plenty of hand gel around Stadium, but you can only see about 1/4 of the entire stadium and the away changing rooms were off limits during the pandemic due to social distancingAtmosphere was great Don't forget the Trent Alexander Arnold and New Henderson murals just off Anfield Rd,  head past the Hillsborough memorial to Anfield Rd by the Portakabin LFCTV, turn left and the murals is along the road on the left, Hendo is opposite"
205,Stadium review,The staff are helpful and very friendly! I would recommend the tour too! The food is great too!!!!!!
206,"You’ll Never Walk Alone, Except When the Tour Guides Busy","Stadium and museum tour, what a stadium. Tour guide was really good. Life long fan.Was a good hour long, and the place was spotless. Staff all friendly.  Other than a player or Klopp showing up it could of been improved."
207,Guided tour,What a wonderful and special day spent at Anfield again.My young son (13) and myself went on this magnificent tour of Anfield and relived the full Liverpool FC story.Every aspect of what it is to be a Liverpool supporter has been harnessed and delivered in this virtual tour.The true test of this tour is that you would want to go back again in the future and take it again.Before your god takes you to your heaven please visit this piece of heaven on earth.
208,Great experience ,"Absolutely amazing tour of the grounds. The tour guides were so helpful and didn’t mind myself and my family taking our time with photographs of the stadium.The tablet addition to the tour was great, it featured a virtual video during specific parts of the tour to show what Anfield is like during match days etc. Even got to keep the LFC earphones at the end. The museum part of the tour was also great, plenty of time and space to view the displays. My dad was very disappointed we had booked the tour a day before the Premier trophy had arrived, however the staff were so helpful and let him return a few days later to get a picture!Overall a great and fun experience for any football fan who appreciates a great stadium and greater team."
209,Definitely NOT English!,"As a Liverpool fan who doesn’t get to games often, it was the first time I’d seen the new-look stadium, and it’s a vast improvement. The atmosphere is always buzzing as well"
210,Top team,"An amazing experience at Anfield. This was not cheap, butt I'll do it again...!! Nice 4-course dinner of high class, cakes at halftime, and a pai after the match. All supplied with all the doing U want... Perfect seatings for the match. I will be back!!"
211,Spiritual home of football,"The staff here are so friendly and love to chat and make you feel welcome. We saw behind the scenes, the dressing rooms, the pitch side, sat in the Kop, visited the Museum and trophy room. The shop was great too, lots to see and buy. What a bonus to find myself standing next to Bruce Grobeller (sorry if I’ve spelt that wrong), who was friendly and chatty and very relaxed about saying hello to my family. The memorial sites are respectful and thought provoking- fitting tributes. All in all it was a fantastic day. Well done Anfield."
212,Stadium tour,"It was great value for money and very interesting. Even our son, who is not that interested in football, really enjoyed it. The staff were really friendly and eager to share their love for the club and their unique knowledge. The tour was e very well organised the Museum well set out. The audio guide gave you lots of information with add ons for those who wanted them. The Hillsborough Memorial is very moving and so is the mural inside the museum. A great place to visit."
213,Visit to Premier League match,"My son loved it took loads of photos, he really enjoyed himself . I only went as needed to take him in. Bit was worth it. Got free headphones as well. He really loved it which I'm pleased with ."
214,Liveprool vs Everton FA Cup 3rd round ,"Being a supporter this experience was absolutely fantastic,all the staff were so welcoming and polite and very accommodating. Great time to be  a Liverpool supporter ,club moving in the right direction both on and off the field. Thanks. #YNWA"
215,Lovely day. ,"Great visit to the home of the World Champions, great history shared with a modern sporting facility make a visit or tour of Anfield an absolute must."
216,LFC mérite mieux ,It was great to get an upclose look at Anfiled and learn about the historic club. Anfield is a classic beautiful football stadium and the tour can be enjoyed at your own speed. A must do in Liverpool for all sports fans!
217,Liverpool  stadium  visit,"Hadn't been for over 30 years. Unbelievable difference but atmosphere as I remembered.The home of association football in the UK. What more can I say. Everybody should go once, even if they don't like football, to see what true passion is."
218,Amazing Anfield,"Me and my dad did a tour around this stadium. It was absolutely incredible. The people, the place everything was impeccable cannot complain about one thing. It’s a must see!"
219,Amazing from start to finish,"If you're a reds fan then this is an absolute must. Lots of history, but lots of current and future stuff. Really impressive and professionally done. I absolutely loved it and would go again"
220,Never walk alone,"The tour guides really made this experience special. The tour itself is really engaging and interesting and is well up to date. We felt very looked after with a pushchair and the staff practiced social distancing. It was a very pleasurable and interesting experience which provided a sound background of the club and its history. We went into the changing rooms and down the tunnel and even onto the side of the pitch. Even if you’re not a huge football fan, the club has such a rich and varied history it is still a very interesting experience."
221,Unforgettable day,Very friendly and informative. The guides couldn't do enough for me. Saw me struggle with the stairs so put me in a lift. Had a brilliant time and I will definitely take this tour again
222,Husband's bucket list,"Very professional with audio hand set, well  set out with fantastic staff at all stages. The lunch was of exceptional quality and whole experience was legendary just like the Liverpool team."
223,DERBY DAY,Fantastic experience A must for any football fanThe amount of trophies and awards is staggeringA not to miss experience!!Fantastic stadium only a short distance from Liverpool town centre
224,Tour,"We are huge Liverpool FC fans and coming to Anfield has been a dream for a long time. It was worth the wait and didn't disappoint. All the guides were friendly, helpful and clearly passionate about the club. Seeing the Premier League Trophy was the icing on the cake."
225,ONE WORD IMMENSE,"Been to watch football lots years ago, but had never done the tour. Took my 9 year old daughter as she had never been and is only now showing interest. We loved it, the stadium is fantastic,  the facilities excellent and the club amazing. But I can honestly say the staff make the tour, well presented,  great humour, knowledgeable and approachable.  Even with the pandemic precautions and measures it was still great. Plus got to see the EPL trophy easily. Well done to all the staff who made our day so special."
226,Must do!,"It was an exhilarating experience traveling from Miami, FL to watch the Reds play Watford at Anfield Stadium. The stadium itself was like a living, breathing thing and the atmosphere was charged with anticipation and excitement. Belting out “You’ll Never Walk Alone” with the other LFC fans was an emotional, surreal experience which I’ll cherish and reflect upon every time I watch the Reds play on TV. There’s nothing quite like English Premier League football."
227,Weekend break,"The feeling of walking round was quite overwhelming. Amazing tour guides, both were really friendly and made helped make the experience"
228,A must do for all Liverpool fans ,Everything was nice apart from the women who where working in the museum restaurant they were very rude and almost being sacastic to me and my dad
229,YNWA - awesome,Hospitality venue was superb. Staff amazing and food excellent. Got the result to top it off..Amazing Day!!!

231,magic reds,"Very enjoyable stadium tour. Staff friendly, informative and engaging.  Interesting to see behind the scenes and well worth the money."
232,Great Fun!,If you are a football fan you HAVE to experience this. If you are. Liverpool fan...why haven't you go yet?
233,Not usually my cup of tea,"Totally enjoyable experience, even if you are not a football or even a Liverpool fan.The tour guide Michael was very knowledgable, funny and his love  for the club came across. Plenty of photo opportunities in this iconic football stadium."
234,Must visit !! ,"Was in city centre for work & had to pop around. It was late in the evening but if your a big Liverpool FC fan this is an absolute must. So glad just to see the outside, can’t imagine what it would be like inside. Will come back 1 day to a match I hope."
235,The tour that exceeds expectations,Anfield is a great place where anyone will enjoy. Its a historic place where any soccer lover will enjoy the experience and narratives.
236,Matchweekend and cityexperiences,"Everything is well organized at Anfield and my wife experienced this for the first time and was not disappointed. The first half of the game was not good, but the players took revenge in the second half and won 4-0."
237,"Magnificent experience with soccer match , once in your life time to see a match here.","Ground has really developed over the last 10 years. Spacious, modern a really positive feel. Excellent store specialising in LFC merchandise (!) and there are bargain rails.  Do the tour. Get to a game if you can, it is very, very special"
238,Liverpool v wolves,"Called for a quick look around after visiting liverpool City centre.Very easy to find and plenty of parking, huge liverpool merchandise shop, snack bar selling food and drink and the booking desk for stadium tours. They were all very busy midweek."
239,Amazing Experience,This is my second time coming here once before lockdown and today. The staff were so friendly and helpful. I enjoyed it so much a great day out for a late birthday treat
240,Stadium Tour,"As a UTD fan I did this for the rest of the family. But I have to say we all had a great time.  We parked right next to the ground. Did the tour had photos in the dressing room, board room and the managers dug out. The sop stocked some great gifts. Would go again!!"
241,Have to visit Anfield,This place is booming with the fantastic game play and let the love continue. take a walk around the outside and enjoy the atmosphere.
242,"A life, a dream!","For a Club steeped in history, seams to rely on history skittle to much, I much preferred the man u tour or the Barca tour"
243,Anfield tour,"Fantastic start to finish especially if you live LFC. Not rushed. All there, go and soak up the history of this great club."
244,Excellent tour ,Very interesting approx hour and half. Used live in Anfield just up road from grounds but never went inside. Not really a football supporter but my gf is. Tour has made me want to watch a match now though  good behind the scenes including dressing rooms.Only thing didn't like was the photo starting at £15 which I think is expensive but you get to look as though your standing with one of your heroes so a true fan IRS probably a small price to pay.
245,Bucket list ticked,"Top class tour. Do at your own pace. Staff friendly, helpful n passionate. Lots to see, great views of the city from the main stand"
246,Amazing,I will visit Anfield stadium again and again and again. The tour trough anfield is great and full of history. A MUST DO if you are a Liverpool fan.
247,Winstanley LFC tour,even though yjr virisis about I jad a fantastic time and could feel the athmospher around the place. I spent time reading all the names and saying a prayer at the memorial for the 07 and must admit reading the names and ages brought a tear to my eues they will neber be forgotten.
248,Excellent if your a LFC supporter.,Whether you like football or not this is A Must do tour when in Liverpool.Easy to get transport to Anfield either by taxi or hop on hop off bus..book a tour time and enjoy the history & unique adrenalin rush when you enter stadium..makes you wish you could get the boots back on.Amazing photo opportunities of dressing rooms pitch The kop museum.memories for ever.Cors lets not forget the tour guides all round stadium..very helpful and you will feel the passion they have for their club.Worth every minute of tour.
249,anfield tour,Excellent tour. The stadium is very impressive. Browse at your own pace no pressure to rush around. I would definitely recommend for all ages to enjoy.
250,Fantastic experience ,"Brought my Dad as one of our anniversaries, too many to mention. A friend's season tickets but I paid the going rate, £57. It's expensive but I do all the aways and they're capped at £30 so this was fine for our less frequent trips to Anfield.Everything about the day was fine. If I have one criticism it would be the leg room. The Centenary Stand is not that old that you could say people have grown since it was built! We are both 6' 3'' and you simply cannot get anyone past you when you're stood up without them making contact in some way.Must mention the last terrible review of Anfield - Georgia2903 - Saints fan trying to be clever/ funny and ending up making a fool of herself. Clocked the pictures posted on TA; tattoos, dirty fingernails,  Full English, squirty cream in your drinks, cheap holiday in Turkey. Scummers indeed."
251,Great Tour,"This was my second visit to Anfield, the first time was as a neutral. This time I was one of 8,000 Shrewsbury Town fans. The stewards are very friendly and the facilities are first class. The Stadium is one of the best I have visited. It was a shame we lost, but a great evening at Anfield all the same."
252,LFC Stadium Tour,Had an excellent few hours @Anfield. Being able to get a little insight into how the ground operates & how the players move around the place.
253,There is too many things to point out!,"Myself and my 16 year old daughter had time to spare as she waited to play her 1st match in a tennis tournament, so we did the Anfield tour about 90 mins for £20 each . Kenny and his side kick are a superb scouse double act proud to be Liverpool ambassadors you can smell the history as you walk round , as nottingham Forest supports Kenny ribbed our plight in a superb way . Stuart matthews . Nottingham"
254,Liverpool Football Club Game,If true Liverpool fan its a must to visit. Stadium is amazing with access to stands /media /dressing rooms pitch side and museum and its all self guided so take as much time as you like we spent 3hours plus just couldn’t take it all in the had food in boot room cafe.
255,Great Stadium and Museum tour,Won the league and got a round trip. Only class. Brilliant tour. would highly recommend. Can't wait to go again to watch games
256,Amazing Experience,Awful full of scousers 10/10 wouldn’t recommend What’s with the bird it’s everywhere and on everything
257,Electric.,"If you are an LFC fan, the stadium tour is a must do. The history and tradition of Anfield and LFC is so impressive. Seeing the field is breathtaking."
258,Pink at Anfield,Completed a bucket list item by seeing the Reds take on Atlético. Anfield was special! Hope to make it back some day.
259,Quick Passing By. Amazing. ,I've been to Anfield a lot of times now and it's the best stadium in the world. Great stadium tour...
260,Its a must,Me and my husband went on the stadium tour today and we had such a great day. We laughed so much at the tour guides Terry and paul. Thank you guys for making it such a special day for us.
261,Best Stadium in England,"never been before but had the chance to go in to see shrewsbury play in FA cup rematch, very nice place as clean as anything and not that expensive on food and drinks"
262,Excellent!,"only a hour to queue , club shop open with fantastic offers , nice cafe + dining family area , ticket office nearby , car parks nearby , if u have ticket for a game then easy access to the stadium"
263,The grandson's birthday treat,Lovely day. We would definitely recommend. Our tour guide as very welcoming and engaging. He spoke loudly enough so everyone in the tour could hear and made our experience really memorable.
264,Wow! Just that!,The tour guide was so passionate his enthusiasm was infectious and really made the tour even more enjoyable. I would highly recommend this trip.
265,Back at The Coliseum,My nine year old really really wanted to do the tour and I was more than happy to take her. We both enjoyed it immensely....We did the unguided audio tour so could go at our own pace and have a good look around behind the scenes. The commentary was really interesting and informative. We also went to the museum including the Steven Gerrard collection and that was honestly great.We had a great time and just to mention the wonderful happy staff who work there. Every single one of them was brilliant !!
266,Wonderful Anfield Tour,"The audio guide was excellent and very informative, really recommend listening to every part of the videos for full experience."
267,If you love LFC you're in for a treat,"I love Liverpool as a child, when many in my country were not allowed to think of Liverpool, I venerate characters like King Kenny Dalglis, Ian Rush or Steven Gerrard, and this winter I had the opportunity to see my dream fulfilled, to sing YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE live in Merseyside derby.I'm a happy man."
268,Great Experience,"I brought this for my husband for Christmas and wow what a good choice, amazing day very well looked after, first class tour guides the grounds and the stadium is amazing .We had a meal as part of the deal and I thought something cheap but it was a 3 course meal, I had soup, lamb and lemon pudding (beautiful) If you want a special present dont hesitate this is worth every penny and Liverpool football club should be very proud of themselves not only for their football this season but stadium is outstanding."
269,Anfield Tour,"Got the result we wanted for the game - but not necessarily the season.  Once-in-a-lifetime wish fulfillment to get to see Anfield with my own eyes.  My first time there, but I pray not the last!  YNWA.  What I'd give to be at the final game this year!"
270,Wow..,"I am not a Liverpool fan (I side with Bologna), but I am a very keen football enthusiast and I always wanted to visit Anfield; especially to add it to the other 10 stadiums I had already seen in UK. Very nice stadium with a lot of history and atmosphere. Keep it up."
271,Love the team and Klop,"Fantastic from start to finish,thoroughly the dogs ........You have to experience this in your lifetime"
272,Class tour.,The staff were very helpful and cheerful! They would inform us of facts whilst providing good humour.
273,Wonderful experience,"One to see if you are visiting, definitely recommend the tour guide was very helpful and explained all the different rooms and what not"
274,"Brilliant tour, guides so passionate and friendly!",Perfect experience ! The atmosphere was something that i will remember forever .One of my best memorys !
275,Better than Disneyland ,"We went as a couple, but my husband has already been 3 or 4 times in the past. He wanted to educate me on the background if Liverpool. The tour was just fantastic the guide was very knowledgeable, and very pleasant talking to both adults and the children. It is something I would recommend for a family day out, or to just spend a leisurely day out.100% recommend 👌"
276,Sight seeing ,"Don't think I need to say anything here.It's Anfield!!!If you are a Liverpool fan you need to see a game here at least once in your life.Amazing atmosphere, amazing vibe so exciting."
277,Amazing ,Was lovely loved the whole stadium had a guild round talked about football stadium answered questions Very impressed would well recommend
278,Tour and a game ,Absolutely  brilliant your Kenny Charlene Evie went above and beyond made my son Lee's day as alwats been his dream too visit Anfield since he was 3 years old now he's 15 we travelled from Scotland too make his dream come true and staff were amazing from start too finish what an awesome day would live too come back again thank you so much Suzanne Mark Lee
279,Amazing,"Best stadium, best fans, best coach. Unforgetttable. May Corona end - and the good times return soon!!!"
280,"Wow, Impressive tour! ","Great experience, brilliant guides. Humor and knowledge - pure professional! We enjoyed it very much and would absolutely recommend it to other families with teens into Liverpool FC."
281,Great tour,5☆No speck of dust in the whole stadium. Every paint surface looks freshly painted and clean to the touch. Money no object.I recommend the full tour and a complete walk around the perimeter of the stand to see tributes to the fallen at Hillbrough and the Bill Shankly Gates which are not in the tour.We're fans of a championship club but couldn't fail to be impressed.Well done.
282,WOOOOW,"Always enjoy going to Anfield, if there is a game on or not, always get a buzz from visiting, any Liverpool fan who's never been, needs to go, the stadium tour is also well worth a visit, so much to see on it, highly recommended, also have a trip into the souvenir shop, lots of choice in there for any Liverpool fan"
283,YNWA,You are guided around using a smart tablet that tells you all about the history of the club and stadium. Amazing views from the top level and inside the ground. Good price and for a little extra get your picture with the 6th Champions league trophy.
284,The legend,"Had a really good day out at Anfield. Teenage daughter wasn’t keen but ended up having a good time. Spent around 3-4 hrs, we went round at our own pace. Museum is definitely worth a visit."
285,Match vs Burnley,Too fast. No translation in French and the second person who is whith us are not friendly. L’institution Liverpool mérite mieux. Par chance ce stade reste magique. #Allezallezallez
286,Good (but not great) stadium tour,"Had a good time on the tour.Our guide Kenny could not have been any better.He had plenty time for our group,no rush from start to finish.Had time for questions and very knowlegable of the history of the club.On arrival we had our temperature checked with the covid 19 ongoing.Plenty of sanitizer as well.Lots of highlights on the tour from the home dressing room to touching the Anfield sign,b4 going down the tunnel to the pitch side.Fantastic experience."
287,Visit with friends,"Terrible experience. Everyone sings ""you will never walk alone"", but when the keeper does not have a good match he gets all the blame alone"
288,YNWA.,"Doesn't matter where you are in this ground, it stinks of urine. I don't really visit here unless I really have to. Usually once a year."
289,This Means More ,"Unlike many tours, you are not corralled like sheep throughout the tour, but rather guided at various points and can take your time at each stage. The audio guides are included in the price and are a good addition, although it would have been ideal if the relevant section of the guide was auto-triggered depending on your location.There is no hard sell and the various bars, coffee shops and gift shops are all clearly marked out for you to spend as long or as little in each.Getting there from Liverpool city centre is as easy as hopping on a No. 26 or 27 bus"
290,Wow,"I’ve been to Anfield a few times now and although I hate to say it, I’ve been to many of stadiums in the UK and in Europe following my team (not telling you which team) and the atmosphere here is like no other.... If your coming here for an away fixture stay over in Liverpool and you’ll love the atmosphere in the City tooTop fans Top stadium 😇"
291,Stadium tour,"We arrived an hour early in shocking weather and didn't want to hang around much so asked if we could bring our tour time forward. We expected it not to be possible but we were quickly moved to our new slot with a smile. The first thing that strikes you is the enthusiasm and friendliness of all the staff. Our lead tour guide was Gordon and he was an absolute diamond. From start to finish he kept us entertained with his encyclopaedic knowledge of all aspects of Anfield and the club and his passionate and humorous delivery. Being from Liverpool myself I already knew a lot of it but the rest of the family are native Leeds but they also loved the whole experience especially my son who is also diehard Liverpool despite having a home city team hopefully about to come up. We went to the main stand, home and away dressing rooms, players restaurant and the pitch level finishing at the lower levels of the kop. As I mentioned it was the enthusiasm of our guide Gordon that really made it special, so a massive thumbs up to him. If you come on weekends it's audio tour only so you will lose out on the personal touch, though it would still be a great day.This was our second tour, the first one was ten years ago. We enjoyed the first, but this one was even better.On a side note it's a real shame it's so hard to get match tickets so Gordon if you've got a couple of spares that would be great !"
292,lovely tour,"1. Scale of stadium is v good then you can see all perspective in soccer field in match v. well. 2. Environment of supporters, the KOP , is v good , they will make you feel excitement and enjoy between match3. Transportation is quite easy , you can take a bus from downtown around 30 mins to stadium but suggest to be there 1.5-2 hr before match to avoid traffic issue but you may wait for a while to take bus back in downtown4. Liverpool shop at stadium is v good , if you can't find items in shop at Liverpool One in downtown area , you can buy tons of them at this place.5. ticket is hard to purchase , pls book in advance to avoid high price at match day"
293,We drank the cool aid ,"I’ve been waiting to come to Anfield for years, and it did not disappoint. I felt like I was walking through history. The sound of the clacking chairs as everyone stood up to watch our front three attack goal was breathtaking. It was an experience that I will never forget."
294,Anfield Stadium tour is a must for the Liverpool fans! ,"Extremely clean, facilities were fantastic. Highly organised and well run. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Brilliant experience!"
295,Kenny and his scouse side kick are superb ,"only went to look round it to say if been lovely ground nothing like i brox though, but still worth a look"
296,Another place off my bucket list ,"Really poor facilities and atmosphere and staff are unfriendly and rude, will never visit again in my life"
297,Great visit to LFC,"Beautiful stadium ! Was just in awe Thoroughly enjoyed stadium tour, highly recommend. They have thought of everything Will be back"
