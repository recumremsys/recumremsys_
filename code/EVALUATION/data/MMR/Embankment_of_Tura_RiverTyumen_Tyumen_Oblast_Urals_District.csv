0,Beautiful,Nice place for walks and to find out about the history of this place! Definetely needs visiting!  Especially on a bright sunny day!
1,Beautiful for a stroll,The banks are a great place for a stroll great for kids as loads of flat areas for roller skating and boring marble walk ways and banks.
2,River embankment ,"WOW ðŸ˜€Incredible,Beautiful City in Siberia!Many places to visit, a little pearl of a city.The people here are so kind and polite.Definitely recommend anyone to visit this area.Part of me will remain here after I return to England ðŸ˜€"
3,Good to have a walk ,Wish I have visited it in summer. It is a very pleasant place to have a walk but in early spring it cold enough.
4,Srunning !,A lot of money has been spent in this embankment !  Superb sculptures along a magical walkway along the side of the river.Very good !   I wouldn't fly to Tyumen just to see it but it's an excellent walk if you are there.
5,Picturesque,"I enjoyed the well-organized Winter Swimming World Championships in Tura River. The embankment was great place for the event. It has to be very beautiful during summer time, it was beautiful even now in the winter sunlight."
6,A really beautifully designed place,"Nice place for good but not too sunny weather, because there is no way to escape the sun. Views of the river are amazing, perfect for sunset/sunrise"
7,My unbelievable Russian Holiday ,The embankment was suberbly built and had lovely views of the river Tura. It was very accessible to the able bodied and disabled alike and provided a pleasant walk alon this beautiful river through the centre of town. Excellent
8,The best place in Tyumen ,This attraction is so beautiful that made me immediately reflect on how stupidly the italian cities have sistematically decided to plan roads filled with traffic long their rivers.This embankment is very beautiful and very long; on it you can run or simply have a rest.The best part of the city!
9,"If you're in the city it's a ""must""",Nice place to walk on a nice day in Tyumen. You can see a lot of money has been spent to create the embankment.
10,Place for lovers and not only,As the title says the embankment is quite a beautiful place. Definitely recommend going for a quiet stroll there if you are in Tyumen.
11,Nice place to walk,I enjoyed such much how extremely nice the riparian area is designed and how lively attained it is. I think it is a kind of new heart of Tyumen and definitively a must see.
12,Great place to walk,Tyumen is not really a city where you must stop while on your trans-sib journey but if you do stop go down to the embankment  and spend an afternoon there. It's probably the only thing that's really nice in this city apart from the nightlife (don't expect a good night life during school breaks). This walk at least gave us something to remember as the city itself was a disappointment. Seeing investments like this in Russian cities gives us hope that maybe once in the future these places will become worthy to come back to.
13,Excellent place for winter championships,"Once upon a time there was nothing, only thickets and swamps. But then the locals have done an amazing beauty. Here you can find lovers to stand at the car and smoke a hookah, couples, skateboarders, skaters, musicians and many other interesting people."
14,Winter Swimming Championships,"I walked from my hotel (Vostok) to the South bank of the river by following to the right the Republic Avenue: sometimes dusty and noisy (traffic) walk for a bit more than 2 km, not very nice under the early June sunshine of Siberia. Meeting theTura and its green banks was a relief. I even crossed the modern bridge to thave a look on the other side. Fortunately, I could get a taxi to get back to the hotel."
15,Seems a bit unfinished,"I've seen couple of embankments of Russian rivers and I wasn't that impressed with this one. The walkway is nice, there's an excellent free public toilet en route, very clean and very nice, but that's it. Embankment should be a public space, a place with benches and cafÃ©s and other places to rest. This is just a long walkway and nothing else. Feels a bit sad."
16,Highlight of my recent trip,"It's just a tad chilly in late December, and really windy. The walkway is well built, and probably amazing in summer."
17,"A pretty site, worth a visit.",I used to live in Tyumen. They started doing the construction just before I left. I took a walk in the morning on a sunny day. It was such a delight. The place was well built and had a nice view of river and churches. Highly recommended!
18,An original view on Tyumen,I went here a few weeks ago. Everyone had been telling me to go here since I moved to the city 2 months ago. It was worth the long walk I took to get there. I didn't stay very long but it was serene and quite pretty.
