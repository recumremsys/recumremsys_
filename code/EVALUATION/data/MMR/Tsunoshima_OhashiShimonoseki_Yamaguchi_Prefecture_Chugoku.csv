0,Iconic Bridge in Yamaguchi,"If you see postcards or magazines of Yamaguchi, more then likely the Tsunoshima bridge will pop up. This bridge is absolutely incredible and the whole island is gorgeous. There is a large parking lot at the base of the bridge for photos and viewing the Sea. Mid way through the bridge is a small pull off area. The bridge is absolutely gorgeous with the turquoise waters. The island hosts many attractions including a lighthouse, shrines, beaches, and hiking. This place does get crowded during peak tourist seasons, so come prepared. If you are in Yamaguchi, this bridge and island are well worth a visit!"
1,"A place with a view, worth to visit","Tsunoshima Bridge and its vicinity have a super-wonderful scenery because of the white sand on the beach. Nobody would expect this light blue color in the sea along the northern coast of the Japan Sea. In summer, staying at a hotel near the bridge can be a wonderful holiday as you can enjoy the white sandy beach near the bridge."
2,What a view!,"I came from Shimonoseki station, hence it was a bit difficult in terms of transportation (JR train ride) and then bus to the nearest station to the bridge. Please check which station your are coming from. Coming from Shimonoseki station, you can either Kottoi station or Takibe station, then wait for the blue bus that will take you to the brigde (that is the entrance of Hotel Nishinnagato Resort, then walk about 2 minutes to the bridge to take picture. And I was lucky to go around the sunset hours, though the bus ride is almost the finale ride.For example, I took 13.44 ride with JR train from Shimonoseki station), arriving to Takibe station at 14.59, And then blue bus at 16.21 arriving at Hotel Nishinagato resort entrance at 16.53. And I had about 30 mins in total to take picture and enjoy sceneries there.And at 17.26 I was back at the bus stop, to go back to Kottoi station (you can also stop at Kottoi station and take a JR train ride to Takibe station-but please check the time table), arrived  at Takibe station took JR train from at the station at 18.22, arrived to Shimonoseki station at 19.31. But please take note that this blue bus actually does cross the bridge to go over to Tsunoshima island, but you must make sure you have enough time to walk and explore around, and please check the time table in advance. Bus services are not that frequent, and if you have 4 people, you may charter a taxi, the station master is able to help you. A single way taxi ride might cost JY5000."
3,"Beautiful drive, relaxing day out","A leisurely drive in north west Yamaguchi.  If you are in the area, a must go with unspoiled island, swimming beaches in summer, calming sea views  some restaurants just while away the day and leave all your cares behind."
4,Splendid!!!,We cycled along Nagato coast and went to Tsunoshima via this long bridge. We slowed down the car traffic a bit as the roads are narrow and there is no dedicated cycle lanes.  A great experience and you can also enjoy more relaxed cycling once you are in Tsunoshima.
5,Hidden pearl in the south of Honsu Island Japan,"This bridge was very famous as incredibly beautiful place among tourists from overseas. I've found it on a English media when I knew this place first. I thought the ocean in Japan was not very beautiful. However, this place is completely different from other ocean in Japan. Blue and clear ocean. nice weather. In addition, a long long straight bridge stretches on the ocean. Its view was perfect!!"
6,Tsunoshima Bridge is famous for the beauty of its vicinity,"The bridge displays the mighty of Japanese technology and creativity, it one place you must indeed visit before you die. It is long and securely constructed across the ocean connecting Japan to China/Taiwan"
7,The real Japanese Roadtrip!,"I didn't know that I can see such a beautiful blue ocean without going too far away from Honshu, Japan. Unfortunately, it was a little bit cloudy when I went there, but it was still beautiful. It offers that feeling of nice country side experience. I will go back there in a heartbeat! (The only problem is, it's not so close from other places)"
8,A great cycling experience,"Although the bridge is a quick ride, it gives you a beautiful view on the ocean. There are a couple of islands that are on the horizon. These make for good pictures. But if you ask me, the main attraction is the island itself. Keep going and you won't be disappointed."
9,Incredibly beautiful place of a bridge and blue ocean,"Tsunoshima bridge is located in the south part of the Honsu island belong to Yamaguchi prefecture. It is quite remote area and maybe still not popular for foreigner traveller. However if you have a plenty of time, it is recommended place to visit it since the scenery is very beautiful. The best time to visit it is during the summer time so you can enjoy its beach."
10,Highway to Heaven,"I think that I do not need the explanation. It is the beautiful sea and scenery of bridge, as you see."
11,Beautiful ocean!,"Nice spot to take some pics, choose for sunny days. If you go once it’s enough and I don’t recommend to go in long weekend!"
12,Wonderful View!,"I cannot find proper word in order to express the beautiful view.Blue sky, blue sea and white light house.You can have good time in this island.Because you can enjoy good sight and sea food.I really recommend you to visit this island.But this island has poor transport network.I recommend you to prepare a rent a car or bicycle, too."
13,The Place You should not die before visiting,"We just happen to drive by the area and decided to cross the bridge. That was a great decision.  The sky had quick moving clouds, so the ocean changed its color from gray to blue in a few minutes we were around.  We could also see some fishing boats and fishermen busying themselves.  The beautiful clear water under the bridge was flowing from one side to the other in an amazingly fast speed.  Crossing the bridge is quick, but there is a small parking in the middle of the bridge as well as on the island side of the bride, where you can park your car safely and enjoy the view to your heart's content.  If you'd like to see the longer and more grand bridge project, your next destination is Okinawa Kaichu Doro!"
14,"Blue ocean, fishing boats, great view","Whilst it may seem out of the way, have no doubt the drive in itself is just as enjoyable as the bridge. With Motonosumi Inari Shrine only about half an hour away, along with a Roadside Station selling foods such as Yakitori, Grilled Squid, Takoyaki alongside standard souveniers and the region's local foods, you'd almost forget there was a bridge if the name wasn't printed everywhere.There is parking before and after the bridge for people to take photos, alongside vending machines (Duh it's Japan), and some shops selling ice-creams and drinks. The drive itself is amazing, with the island that it leads to being equally as amazing. The bridge itself is a lot longer than you think, maybe taking about 5 minutes to cross from start to finish with various slopes and mini islands being passed. Don't think I saw a single non-local tourist there, so if you want a unique experience, slightly off the beaten track, make sure you give this place a visit, especially the Roadside Station for food and gifts!"
15,Bridge with a view,Highway to HeavenThat is what comes to my mind the first time I crossed this. Unforgettable sights...breathtaking beauty of the sea....wonderful experience traveling bothways!
