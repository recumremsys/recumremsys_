0,Everyone is so polite and they would lead you anywhere!,"What an extraordinary piece of history! Although scientists took out the mummies inside for studies, to be honest it is a recommended place to visit. It would have been better if we saw the real mummies in the pyramid that were left untouched."
1,A dream came true,"As one of the original World Wonders the pyramids are still very much worth while to visit. Even now that the city of Caïro has almost sprawled out to the foot of the pyramids (or the sfinx anyway) and the dessert sharm of these buildings in the dessert has gone a bit. Be weary of the touts who can be very annoying surely now that visitor numbers are still  quit low. Other side of the medal is that the lac of tourists makes for a much nicer visit with almost no waiting que. Hors carriage or camel rides are readily available but shorely not a must, all of the monuments are also reachable by foot, but takes a lot of walking..."
2,Beautiful!,"Just think they were built 40 centuryes ago, and they're still there, absolutely magnificent, absolutely astonishing... You must go there once in a life. It's one of the most impressive spots in the world. You really can feel History there.And if possible, you must go inside one of the pyramids. I went into Kefren's. I was afraid It could be claustrophobic, but It wasn't as narrow as I imagined, there weren't problems to breathe, it wasn't too hot...It only takes 10 minutes to arrive the main camera and sincerely It's worth paying the price."
3,Can't believe how small we are next to them!!,"Seeing these magnificent structures, still standing after millennia, is very humbling. All we see with our eyes has been marveled over by many through the centuries and we still are not sure how they were achieved. It is surrounded by sand and rocks...and vendors. You can't blame them, they are making a living. They have some very interesting stuff but I just want my memories. The camel ride of 10 minutes was enjoyed by some but it feels a little like a little kid pulled on a pony. The views are hard to describe until you are there."
4,Nice visit at Pyramids of Giza,"If you love Egyptian history the pyramids are absolutely amazing! The entire necropolis is a must see.I prefer going to these areas alone as then there is no restriction on the time that I can spend. JUST A PRE WARNING, ENTRANCE TO THE AREA AND THE PYRAMIDS CLOSE AT 4pm. The pyramids are also closed between 1-2pm and if you are thinking of going inside it can be claustrophobic.The reason I have to give this place 4 stars is because the number of locals that con you. DO NOT ENTERTAIN ANYONE until you get to the official ticket booth which is at the top of the hill.If you stop for the locals they will make up a number of lies to force you to go with them. They will point you towards their own ‘ticket offices’ they will say you aren’t allowed to walk up to the pyramid by yourself.You also have a number of ‘fake ticket inspectors’ within the complex who will then say they will give you a so called ‘free’ tour. Don’t fall for it as they will try and charge you at the end. The only place your ticket gets checked is the entrance to the pyramids and the entrance to the complex Also don’t believe anyone when they say about ‘government ID’. They have just printed badges off.Don’t let locals take a picture for you as they will expect a tip, just ask other tourists Finally Uber is extremely cheap in this country but most drivers don’t know their way around so  add about 20 minutes to journey. It is a really enjoyable place to visit, but just ignore all locals.ALSO THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH AT THE TICKET OFFICE.Adult: 200 E£ for area entry Adult: 400 E£ for pyramids entry"
5,An experience of a lifetime,"A beautiful site to see.  They are absolutely amazing.  My time here was ruined however by the constant disturbance by hecklers.  My husband speaks Arabic and they were calling each other to inform them of where we were to bother us for tips.  That was the first mistake we made is tipping someone. The utter abuse of their horses is disgusting.  Please do not take a horse carriage ride.  The government should not allow any horses in there and use trolleys like they use in Luxor to transport people.  The horses were malnourished, searching for food and slipping and sliding on paved roads going down hill not able to stop the carriage.  Stray dogs everywhere searching for food.  I couldn’t really appreciate the beauty of the pyramids because of the utter horrifying scene surrounding it. Wish things were different.  I gave it a two for these reasons and because when I look back and think about my experience I feel sad.   I don’t think I could go back unless things were different there."
6,Great pyramids of Giza ,"Of course the pyramids and the Sphinx are very impressive world class attractions, which is why so many people make the effort to visit. But one shouldn't underestimate the hassle factor involved when visiting - touts, camel ride sellers, all kinds of scams and rip-offs and hordes of tourists. It's a very overwhelming experience, but still worth the effort. Be prepared to spend at least half a day here in order to see the site properly."
7,"Pyramids of Giza, A World Treasure",An absolute must see in Egypt and Cairo. The construction of these world treasures has continued to be a serious debate amongst archaeologists and engineers and seeing them in person just confirms what a monumental task the construction must have been. It is well worth purchasing the extra ticket to climb inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu. Low ceilings and walking up a steep incline can be a bit daunting.
8,Won’t be having a third visit,"These are the most famous monuments around the world. No trip in Egypt is complete without a visit to these amazing works standing proudly for millenia, from the dawn of civilization. Be warned, there are lots of street sellers buzzing around the tourists. Good idea to visit the museum of the royal ship of Khufu, just around his pyramid."
9,Highlight of Cairo,"The pyramids continue to be a mystery and standing at the foot of the pyramids was a fascinating experience. It is helpful to go with a guide, and also choose a time when there are fewer tourists. We travelled in February, their winter months (although it is still quite hot around 25C).  Wear comfortable shoes, a good hat and sunglasses as the sandstorms can suddenly just arise.  The pyramids do not have much of a touristy feel to it. There are camel rides on offer.  The sphinx is close by and there are toilets available at exorbitant fees of 2 euros."
10,A global treasure ,"Yes, they are THE Pyramids of Giza. It is amazing that they are still here and are the last remaining original wonders of the ancient world. I loved the fact I could touch them and climb on them. We took photos, climbed up and went down the tomb shaft, and were harassed by throngs of souvenir sellers. Spent about an hour here."
11,FULL OF SCAMMERS HORRIBLE,The pyramids were the highlight of our visit to Cairo. Truly amazing.The sound and light show that is offered in the evening is cheezy though.
12,the larges pyramids in egypt,My husband and I went to see the pyramids and the sphinx via uber. The place is very busy with tours and also Egyptians. To go into pyramids cost extra EGP so keep that in mind.Also be careful of Egyptians trying to sweet talk you into a camel ride or them taking your photo as they will charge you for it! We walked to all the sites and took us a good 4hrs to enjoy the whole area.Would definitely recommend it if you like ancient history!
13,Deservingly the oldest of the seven wonders of the ancient world,"This is a truly wonderful and mesmerizing site. It is like no other. Imagine how people lived and marched along these grand structures few thousands years ago! To get to the site, you can take a bus or a taxi. To find your way into the entrance it was quiet a hassle passing all the camel tour pushers. If you can avoid them and go straight into the entrance that would be quiet an achievement. Be persistent though, don't let them ruin your visit to this wonderful site."
14,Beautiful!,It is an amazing place to visit and it has a magic in it. The history and the story of these pyramids are just amazing.I would love to visit again
15,The most exciting experience in my life❤,It was surreal seeing the Pyramids in person as opposed to books and pictures. They are amazing!Everyone should get a chance to visit Cairo and see the Pyramids.
16,Amazing to See In Person,"It was definitely a “WOW” moment when you first see them.  The largest of these three structures in ancient Egypt is the Pyramids of Khufu built more than 2,600 years before the time of Christ. It stands 480 feet tall, this pyramid is the last of the seven wonders of the ancient World that still stands. Along with these major monuments are a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as ""queens"" pyramids, causeways and valley pyramids. Took 33,000 workers involved in the construction of the  project. You’ll need to spend a few hours here or more. Positively a MUST DO! We We’re not able to go inside today because of electrical issues inside. We were able to go inside the pyramid of King Khafre (you will need to pay another 100 EGP). Vendors are quite aggressive so no eye contact unless you want to buy something."
17,UNESCO World Heritage Site,"I visited Giza pyramids and I really loved the place so much it is something I never imagined, but just be careful from the vendors their because all what they want is money."
18,Amazing to see,"It is just mind blowing to stand in front of the great pyramid and just be amazed at the size and the scale. We stayed at the Marriott Mena House and was a short walk from there to the main entrance . We stayed for 2 days and for the first day did the tour through Emo tours ( booked directly on their site- they have coupons too; will do a separate review) - full day including Dahsur, Saqara and Memphis . The tour picked us up and bought tickets - the entrance to the site is EGP 200; entry into Great Pyramid is EGP 400 and solar boat museum is EGP 100; Memphis EGP 80; Dahsur EGP 60; Saqara EGP 180. We also did the add on for camel ride with the tours. The first day we did the private tour and second day went by ourselves. This was great to get a lay of the land. Going with a private tour was great to keep the other guides away . They tour covered all the entry tickets and the next day we bought our own tickets when we went by ourselves. Make sure you have Egyptian pounds they do not take credit cards. We first visited Cheops , then Khafre and the care took us to the camel ride - make sure you ride to the desert view to get a panorama of all the pyramids. The camel guides are adept at getting all the usual touristy photos. Tip them about 10 EGP . We then went to see the Sphinx and drove to Memphis, Saqara and dahshur - these are less touristy sites but must be visited to get a real appreciation of the efforts made prior to building the great pyramid. Friday’s tend to get busy at the pyramid as it is a holiday . Do bring water and a snack - we had nutri grain bars, fruit and yogurt. On the drive to other sites stop by local markets and pick up fresh fruits absolutely delicious. We went inside the red pyramid ((Saqara)and husband went inside the great pyramid at Giza - both are recommended for going in. We watched the sound and light from the Pizza Hut roof top"
19,A true wonder of the world,"We loved the tour; the inside of the pyramid is as breathtaking as the outside. I would suggest you allow yourself enough time, and not let others rush you and ignore those who would try to sell you something."
20,World class attraction with a serious hassle factor,"The pyramids themselves were breath taking and with the Sphinx next door and the Cairo museum a short distance away it is a superb way to spend a day. we took a horse and carriage ride around the Pyramids which was excellent and gave an idea how vast they are,( camel rides are…"
21,Overrated,"The only remaining wonder of the Ancient world is still here to be admired. The most unforgettable experience is a camel ride in this area (with all great pyramids in the background) but it is also amazing to go into the pyramids where you must bow down sometimes during your hiking up and down. The Great Sphinx is just below the Pyramid of Cheops and three queen's pyramids. For miles around, you can see the beginning of the Sahara Desert on one side and Cairo as a metropolis on the another. It is simply astonishing to see these amazing building exploits, historic miracles which are still very mysterious."
22,A Dream Come True!,We still can’t get over the fact that we saw the pyramids with our own eyes. They are absolutely stunning. We arrived around 930 am and thought we couldn’t get nice pictures. But we were lucky! The crowd wasn’t too bad. You must also go to the panoramic view area. It gives you a nice view of the pyramids with misty sky and Cairo city view as backdrop. Wonder of the world indeed!Tips: Go early to avoid crowd and heat. There will be long queue of vehicles lining up to get through security check point.
23,A truly amazing experience,I was in awe of the pyramids... definitely a highlight of my trip to Egypt and Turkey  This is something everyone should do once in their life.
24,Not National Geographic,"From the time we are in Jr. High we have heard about the Egyptians and their magnificent pyramids. . . Well, they are spectacular.  Of all the man made wonders we have seen these 3 stand out as ""The Best."" Much of that awe is pegged to the time frame in which these were built and the massive amount of materials and effort that went into these beauties. Go see them!"
25,Mind Blowing Experience,"This area is hell on earth for carriage horses and camels! We where supposed to have a wonderful trip to the pyramids at Giza. But I started crying the second we got there and it was impossible to enjoy! The pyramids are amazing but seeing such animal cruelty certainly dissappointed me. It’s impossible to enjoy the view and the pyramids seeing all of this horror and knowing what is going on here. This is a world heritage site and this should not be happening.I was so heartbreaking  to see the extremely poor conditions the horses have at the giza pyramids. Many of the animals are clearly injured and are underweight, with their bones showing and with visible wounds. They are forced to work taking tourists around the pyramid sights with no water or food. Some horses slipped and stumbled on the smooth tarmac surface. Despite the heat, there was no water supply. This area is hell on earth for carriage horses and camels. This horror must be stopped! This place which at one time must have been magnificent, now is unfortunately one of the filthiest places on earth and looked after by the most heartless people."
26,Family of Pyramids,This is an amazing creation of engineering ideas. So  unbelievable place and the top of everyone's must see list in Egypt.  One of the most exciting experience ever. If you come to Egypt you should visit this landmark. Guide is not necessary in my opinion. You can walk everywhere! You don’t need a horse or camel.
27,To an engineer it is obvious how they were built - NO aliens did not help,"Our tour to the Pyramids was arranged by Viator that offered an 8 hour private tour of the Pyramids, Sphinx, Egyptian Museum and the Bazaar.Our guide Bassem, an Egyptologist was qualified and had a good knowledge of Egyptian history. Of all the marvels of Egypt the Pyramids leave the most vivid and lasting impression. The Pyramids stand out in the desert with an aura of greatness and mystery. Most of the Pyramids were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their companions during the old and middle kingdom periods.In Giza there are three Pyramids . The biggest one is called Khufu, the middle-size one is called Khafre and the smallest is called Menkaure. Climbing the pyramids to the gate (it is prohibited to climb to the top) was a good experience and on the advice of our guide we did not go inside because we were told there is nothing much to see other than tunnels leading to excavated tombs.We had a good view of the three Pyramids from a spot that offered people to ride camels to the nearby Pyramids. This is a nice experience but its best you leave your guide to handle the arrangement with the camel owners for the ride. Do remember to take a photo on the camel with the Pyramids in the background. The guide can snap this for you.Munir D."
28,Some of the Finest Treasures of the Entire World,"We had Memphis Tours of Cairo arrange for a 4 am entry to the Pyramids.  It was amazing to be there by ourselves.  NOBODY else was there.  We could examine, learn, take all the pictures we wanted with no photo bombers and pushy rude tourists.  Absolutely over the top experience and a must see in Egypt.  If you want to avoid the thousands and thousands of tourists - get the private entry."
29,The Pyramids,"Although insanely crowded when we visited (it was a holiday time for local schools), this is still a brilliant sight to see and we loved every minute here.  The “solar boat” museum was, for me, the highlight of the day — more than 4000 years old and in spectacular condition.  Don’t miss it!"
30,Great Pyramids by Day and Night,"Wow. Wow. Wow. Although I have seen many pics of the Pyramids, it’s nothing like standing next to them and even more to go inside. I suggest coming early in the morning, especially if one travels in the hot months. Weather was terrific and we saw the sites when not a lot of people were around. We payed extra to go inside. It’s very humid inside and crowded bcs there is barely room to go up. Once in a life time site."
31,"Pyramids/Sakkara with Reham S,","The pyramids of Giza are visually stunning; let’s face it, they have been a principal tourist attraction for 4,000 years. Could all those people be wrong? But, here are a few details worth noting:  First, there are three main pyramids, but 99% of the average focus is on the largest of the three. If you have no problem with claustrophobia you can actually climb into the pyramid through the entrance created by the original grave robbers and work your way down a tunnel into the burial chamber — now dark and empty. It’s hot, crowded and tight, but a neat experience if you are up to it. Second, the Sphinx is right near by so you get to see both on your visit. Third, don’t miss the boat museum adjacent to the pyramid. It contains the reconstructed boat that was buried near the pyramid for the Pharo’s trip into the after life. Really cool."
32,Extraordinary,"I've given this one star to get your attention. In fact, the pyramids are amazing and if it wasn't for the low life scammers who are everywhere on the approach to the pyramids and when you get inside, it would be a great place to visit.From the moment you get near the ticket booth  you will be met by various people who ""work for the government and will protect you from the other scammers"". The camel owners and carriage owners will practically bundle you on to their camel or carriage and there will be various ways to make you pay more money. After constant arguments you might be able to get off and clear of your robbing host and then you are besieged constantly with people trying to sell you stuff.Along with taxi drivers offering various ""special trips"", scams to get more tip money, short changing at the ticket office of The National Museum, asking money for taking a photo that you don't want and numerous other cons that I heard about, it was a fraught and quite stressful visit. While i appreciate that Egypt's tourist industry has been hit hard in recent years, it is my opinion that the Egyptian people could do a lot more to make you welcome.Our trip down the Nile was great but I felt that most of the traders and shopkeepers would rob you blind if they could."
33,Sunset at the Pyramids,"We loved our visit to Pyramids of Giza , our only complaint was the seller men! They are very annoying! Try to avoid , just say La Shokran “No Thank You”😀"
34,"Lats wonder of the world, must visit but be wary of belongings and people.","Absolutely beautiful, exactly what you would expect. The engineering and the grand beauty is out of this world. We didn’t go into these pyramids, but traveling around the outside is breathtaking. The on-site museum that houses the ship that was buried with the king is crazy amazing, such a treasure and so old. Keep in mind you have to check your camera at the door or pay a camera fee. We checked our camera without any issues, but did remove the SD card first. A few pointers. There will be hundreds of people trying to sell you things and a lot of “random” people that offer to take your photo. If you have somebody your camera even if they say they won’t charge you, they will (unless they are another tourist or obviously a guide). If a police officer wants to help you in any way, they will want a tip. If you take a photo of somebody that is there to sell you something, they will want a tip. The camels and horses smell so bad, I am sure if you ride one you can throw out your closing including your shoes. If your there to enjoy yourself and just ignore the people trying to sell you something, you will have the time of your life!"
35,Incredible wonder of the world. ,"The Pyramids in Giza, Cairo leave a lasting and vivid impression. We have almost all seen these on the list of seven wonders of the world. They arouse deep and intellectual questions on how they could be built and some of the guides do tell you that nobody knows how these were built. Some books provide details of how these could have been built by ordinary people with all the technological limitations of the modern world.The pyramids have a vivid impression on the serenity of the desert with the sharply defined shadows they cast on the sand and with the aura of greatness and mystery they carry.We did not enter the inside of the pyramids because our well-informed and studious guide, an Egyptologist called Bassem, suggested there was nothing special to see inside. He then took us to a place for a camel ride. He had pre-arranged the camels we were to use. The camel ride was a good experience. From the back of the camel one can see all the Pyramids at one go thereby providing a good opportunity to take photos. Photographs can even be taken prior to riding the camels.The camel ride on the dessert sand made us feel we were in Arabia. Good experience and certainly worth the visit. We did the Pyramids in the afternoon as in the morning part of Cairo tends to have fog.Munir D."
36,AMAZING!,One of the best things I have seen. I went at a great time when barely anyone was there and the pyramids looked amazing! they were so big and it was just as i had imagined. Great experience and a total Must see.
37,One can comfortably walk around the three pyramids in 2 hours,"Absolutely brilliant! No wonder this is a wonder of the world. The main pyramid stands out among the rest of the lot, owing to its delicate bricks layout and the way one sits on another. Its a piece of art that fascinates so much. Beware of the hawkers though!"
38,The great Giza pyramids,"We hired a tour guide and did the camel  ride , absolutely great . It is better to have a guide with you so you can avoid a lot of the solicitors that are everywhere .    So sad that they do not keep the are clean ."
39,Amazing ,"This place is well worth a visit...the pyramids speak for themselves. Very busy around Giza for anyone wanting to drive in - wouldnt recommend or if so, get there early or grab an Uber. Once inside you are constantly approached by people offering camel rides, horses, items for sale etc. This is mostly ok when you say no thank you they're polite and leave you alone. However we did encounter a couple of people who at first seemed genuine and friendly but once they engage you in any kind of conversation you then feel pressured and obliged to give them cash! I'd advise to not speak to anyone unless you specifically want to do a calm ride etc. Also, taking photos of/with camels will result in you having to pay the owner...beware of this!Other than that, fascinating place. There is a small pyramid you can enter included in the ticket price...our hotel host advised this is the same as the larger one which you have to pay for, so save your cash and just go in th small one."
40,Not worth the aggro,"Touring the Great Pyramids with a personal guide and driver is a must. Our tour guide Reham Shawky and driver Ibrahim Essa, did a fantastic job of making sure we had an early start on our first day in Cairo/ Giza -to see the Great Pyramids, the Sphinx, Valley Temple, the Sakkara complex and Old Kingdom’s Capital , Memphis.This first days journey was comfortable and good pace. Our driver was able to drive us right up to the sites. Once there, Reham share the facts and fun side notes about the World Heritage sites. She knew just the right places to take the perfect picture and would even take some pictures of us (little things like taking a picture make for a great tour).Reham is a licensed guide, She has a Masters degree in Egypt History. She is very knowledgeable and approachable with questions, even about her daily life as a guide and mom during the busy tourist season. She is excellent guide and speaks beautiful English. If you are needing a guide for a tour, my husband and I would highly recommend Reham."
41,On the go tours ,"It is truly an amazing experience to stand in the Sahara Dessert and see the Pyramids of Giza, to get the perfect view is quite a distance from the entrance of the Pyramid gardens therefore it may be suggested by the guides to take a camel or horse and carriage ride, be aware though that there negotiation skills are very sly..they make you believe that they are giving you a price for your group but when you pay they change their story to the price being per person - BE AWARE, they really ripped us of and refuse for you to get off when you want to cancel the ride..."
42,Busy even in shoulder seasons but easier to get clear photos without hordes in your viewfinder.,"My egyptian fiance and I took a car to go around the pyramids and we had a great time! It’s true that there is people trying to sell camel trips and more but as you say „la, shukran“ (No, thank you) in a serious way they leave you Alone. Just be prepared that you have to show that you are definitely not interested. The entry price of 200pound for foreigners is super fair and we paid small extra money to See the Pharaos boat. That was super cool! We didnt Go inside the pyramid and I think that was a good Choice. Since we went on a friday ( public holiday) we were a little concerned it would be crowded so we went early from 9 to 11 in the Morning. There were not many people, also not that many sellers and you have a lot of opportunities to take a great picture! The pyramids are huge and very impressive as well as the Sphinx! To the animals: I agree it is not nice that camels and horses have to pull Big and many tourists up the hill to the photo point but I‘ve seen way worse. You don’t need to take an Animal, you Can walk ( altough in Summer that might be tough.. I think it will roughly take 45 min to Go to the photo Point which is nice But not necessary for your Perfect pyramid day) or Just take a car ( Can order in an App, we paid 300 pound for having the car plus driver 3 Hours plus 35 EGP car entry fee) To the people complaining so much about the animal abuse: think about not eating them, cause i am quiet sure most of you do. Bring water as you can Not buy it there 😊"
43,A must see,"Totally worth it! It was an amazing experience. Even if I saw millions of photos of them, being there was as great as I expected. It's such an amazing experience to just be there, see them with your own eyes and touch them, this treasures made 5000 years ago. Just WoW! The great pyramid is huge and humbling. But the site is a bit chaotic and I assume difficult to navigate without a guide as there are basically hustlers on every inch and nothing is marked and there are no official trails or tracks. This site could be organized so much better. There is one free small pyramid you can enter, the big one is extra cost and quite expensive. The view point where you can see and photograph all pyramids is not accessible by foot, you have to take a horse or a camel, which is very expensive. The camels looked well taken care of, but in January was not hot so maybe think again if you want to ride an animal in summer months. Would recommend winter for visiting, it was not crowded and it was chilly and windy, not hot at all."
44,Amazing,"surreal to be standing right there, in front of the pyramids and the sphinx. got some great photos and marveled at the wonder of these ancient structures."
45,Amazing ,"Words are not enough to describe of how clever people were those days. Having an excellent local guide she told us a lot of things about the history behind, the way they were build up and general. What was disapointing it was the camel ride. It wasnt worth of the money we've paid (and it was already a discounted one). The boy that lead the camels didn't care much about us and on the way when we asked him to take some pics he was asking again and again for a good tip. Pics were very far and he didn't seem to care about us at all. After giving him a tip he said is small but ok.... A tip is a gift my lil man... : ("
46,AMAZING Pyramids is an Understatement - PRIVATE ENTRY,"I think it goes without saying that if you're visiting Egypt you have to see the Pyramids.  They're one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World for a good reason; they're absolutely amazing to see and truly iconic.  I've heard of some people being disappointed when seeing them in person, but I can't understand why.  They are exactly what I expected and seeing them in-person in simply a great experience.  Since we were here, of course we paid for the extra ticket to go inside the great pyramid.  Was there anything to see inside?  No, not especially.  Was it worth it though?  Definitely.  Just to be able to go inside the pyramid is an experience you simply can't have anywhere else, and since we were there, we just had to do it."
47,We loved the Pyramids ,"I visited the Pyramids of Giza during a Scenic Tour with my husband and daughter who is in her early 20s, and we loved it! We got up close and personal to view these amazing structures. My husband paid some extra money, can’t remember how much it was, to go inside the tomb. It was hot an cramped in there, but he was pleased he went in. He enjoyed that while my daughter and I took photos of the pyramids. We were hassled by people trying to sell souvenirs, but that’s just what happens everywhere. The funny thing was being approached by Egyptian school kids visiting from the country to have photos taken with us. Apparently, according to our tour guide, they probably wouldn’t have seen westerners before, so we were a novelty. To be honest, it all added to the experience. We also got taken by our tour out further to view The Pyramids of Giza from a distance. Our daughter paid to go sit on a camel. Great experience!"
48,A must do!,"The pyramids are interesting but not fascinating. Sadly the development of Cairo has seen housing, hotels and a Pizza Hut to open but steps away   One sees these because they are so accessible but this is not why one comes to Egypt."
49,Stunning,"Okay so firstly the pyramids are amazing they really are incredible but! There is a huge but I believe something needs to be done bout the scammers and needs to be some sort of security around the pyramids the grounds leading to them are crawling with locals constantly harassing you they have every way around overcharging and sneakily ripping people off when it comes to the camel and horse rides, then theres the loiters thy are trying to sell you items fine but they should not be able to harass and harass and harass you to the point of you feeling threatened, the locals will take your phone out of your hand then demand money and yell at you if you don't offer them enough, you pay for ticket in there so how is this place not monitored once in the gates this is a joke really one of the most gorgeous things you will ever see it totally ruined by this sort of behavior. Would I return here definitely not and the only reason for that is the local scamming. They are bad everywhere around Egypt yes but here it's out of control.The pyramids themselves amazing! They will leave you in ore.We went in side the standard one included  in admission the smaller one. It was quite small inside very hot but a cool experience. Narrow path in and quite steap.Wear flat shoes to this attraction as ground is quite Rocky.The best place for photos is a platform over behind the pyramids looking back which you would need a lift little far to walk especially in the heat but over here we didn't get harassed at all and the camel owners there appeared to be alot more pleasant and realistic with prices. We're not pushy this side of the pyramids was a relief."
50,THE DREAM OF THE PYRAMIDS WAS RUINED FOR ME,This is a must do visit. We enjoyed walking around and visit the pyramids. We went into the middle one. We also went for a carriage ride. Make sure you do not get cheated. It is 350 pound per carriage and not per person.
51,A Dream Come True,"The Giza Pyramids are an iconic sight.  It's awe inspiring to walk up to them, see the size of the individual blocks of that were quarried, moved and laid here, and think that it happened thousands of years ago.  Just walking around them and looking at them is an unforgettable experience.  The Sphinx is part of this complex.Although they are not far from the Cairo Governorate, they are in the desert, and that is almost as awe inspiring at the structures themselves."
52,Must see wonder of the world,This was definitely the highlight of the trip. Still trying to comprehend how this was built without modern day equipment. Visit inside the Pyramid was also an excellent experience -but be prepared to climb and crawl.
53,Pyramids of Giza daily visit,"Great place and magestich monuments, pity the whole experience was ruined by locals that follow you like flies, so annoying. So the magical moment became just the most annoying experience of all."
54,Astounding ,"We went to see the Pyramids and got so much more! With the help of Yassmin at Sun Pyramids Tours, Ali our excellent driver, and Mahamed our tour guide we had a super informative tour of the Pyramids and even a camel ride (not for the feint-hearted) or a fun buggy and horse ride…"
55,What can be said?,one  of  the  most stunning wonders ever  created by hum beings only when  you are standing at t he  bottom of the  pyramids  you  will truly  understand  how  magnificent they are.
56,"Absolutely amazing, time of your life! ","Everyone is familiar with the pyramids. We've all seen them in photos, movies and on TV. But they are bigger, much bigger than I expected. They are absolutely awesome. They were on my bucket list, I thought I knew why, but I simply was not prepared for how enormous they are."
57,Unbelievable site,"Let's be fair - The Great Pyramids of Giza are great indeed and there is no doubt in that. It's people who make the place horrible - from thousands of school kids who want a selfie or a picture to pushy sellers who want to make money on you no matter what. The only thing you want while you are there, is just to be left alone or leave the place asap!I believe the government or tourism department should look into the issue, as it is a shame that your own people are scaring the tourists away from such a beautiful historical place!On the way out we've made another mistake of taking a road through the real slum on the to the entrance. That was a truly appalling and shocking view to see how people right behind the touristy pyramids exist. Overall, it's definitely a place to see, but be ready that the experience won't be pleasing."
58,Wonderful,"Cheops or Khufu is beyond words. It is the largest thing made by humans ( and other sources) and without comparison.They say 25 years to build it. At 2,300,000 blocks weighing around 10-30 tonnes each, that is one block every 3 minutes - if you assume daylight hours only. Forget the flood season interfering - oh they floated all the blocks down the Nile, so that’s 92,000 blocks a year, every year or 21 per hour. Chiselled our with COPPER or BRONZE tools, finished to 3-5mm tolerance over the face 2-5M long.(8,760 hrs X 25 years /2 divide into 2.3M - yes, not possible.)This structure should not exist . Simples."
59,A WONDERFUL PLACE,You cannot go to Egypt without visiting the pyramids of Giza. Impressive constructions! Plan a tour of 8 hours to cover the different sites. We went in January. Cool temperatures (18-20 degrees C) and it was not crowded at all.We especially liked the back side of the pyramids with the desert because the city arrived almost at the feet of the pyramids...
60,A wonder of the world indeed!,"Pyramids of Egypt is something that we have read about in our childhood in Junior Classes as part of the 7 Wonders of the World and later as a part of Egyptian History in the Higher Classes. While the pictures always fascinated us, it was a great feeling to stand in front of those Pyramids and look at them in close quarters. It was  a Dream come True. Any amount of appreciation for these ancient architectures is not enough. Wish we could stand there for hours and watch the Pyramids but being in a Large Group, we had to appreciate everyone's time and the planned itinerary."
61,Absolutely amazing what was created some thousand of years ago ,"Of course, when visiting Egypt, you must see the piramids. The piramids are special each on their own, so take time to see the most important ones."
62,"of course it's a 5! come on, it's the PYRAMIDS!","Magnificient, no words can describe how amazing the Pyramids of Giza are until you see them in person"
63,Eternal wonder,"  One of the wonders of the world. Magnificent, mysterious and a must to visit if you are in Egypt. Lots of tourist, lots of Egyptians, lots of camels. If it’s your first time here do get a tour guide! "
64,Bucket List! ,Every time I visit the great pyramids of Giza I get the same impression WOW . Nothing to say more :).
65,Stunning!,Along with Machu Picchu the Pyramids of Giza are just breathtaking and an experience that is extraordinary to have. We had a few hours on this site with our brilliant tour guide bringing to life so many illuminating facts for us. The area surrounding the pyramids is very difficult to walk around.  The surface is not only very uneven but mostly precarious. The Government really should put a 12 metre wide boardwalk around this site to make it safe for tourists. Unesco sites around the world have been made safe for tourists to walk around why not the Pyramids at Giza ?
66,Story book visit,"It’s hard to grasp your head around the idea of visiting a landmark that is so ancient. Besides the large crowd, I enjoyed being able to see and experience the pyramids that have always caught my image."
67,2.2 million stones.  How did they build it?,Words cannot describe the splendor of the entire site.  Plan several hours to take it all in. We decided to do a camel ride and were  glad we did.  Avoid doing the light show at night. It is total waste of time and money.  It is very dated.
68,Amazing Pyramids Spoiled by Pesky Vendors,"Visiting the pyramid was the highlight of our Egypt tour. To be there, up close is a sight to behold. It was the first of the seven wonders of the world and has withstood all odds for more than four thousand years!We stood there for a while and gazed at the Great Pyramid in all its ancient glory and majesty. What an unforgettable experience!We made the right decision to enter the Great Pyramid despite warning that one has to walk bending forward and the lack of oxygen. Only a third of our tour group chose to be inside this great structure.It was an amazing experience climbing the narrow stairway, which is bi-directional, to the Great Gallery before reaching the King's Chamber.Though what we could see is just a lidless stone sarcophagus (no mummy) in a big space with high ceiling.  It was an out-of-this-world experience to know that we were standing in the heart of the Great Pyramid and I let that moment sink in and sear into my mind.Totally worth it to visit."
69,Truly wonders of the ancient world,"The pyramids itself is beautiful, nut there's a lot of criminals who will treat you telling you lies that will cost you a lot of money. They basically assault you. Just stay alert and avoid contact with them."
70,Amazing Pyramids ,"As I gazed at the Giza Pyramids after visiting them, I realized that the sun has been setting behind them for over 1.4 million times. Take your time when visiting the majestic pyramids of the Giza Plateau. Universally recognized around the world; these imposing structures have been a tourist attraction since they were built over four thousand years ago. Anyone who comes to Egypt visits the pyramids, be it the modern tourist of today or the tourist of yesterday, Napoleon or Julius Caesar. The three pyramids of Khufu, Krafre and Menkuara are a outstanding site as nothing beats taking a photograph of them on a sunny day. This was the second time visiting these wonders (first in 2010 and now in 2020). I found that an winter’s morning, the three pyramids are shrouded in early morning fog which makes an eerie photographic opportunity. And that by the afternoon, when the fog had lifted the photograph is clearer. However, on the day of my last visit, it was sprinkling spots of rain and overcast at times. A strange day when it rains in Cairo. Plenty of camel rides to be had along with touts selling all sorts of things. We somehow managed to be there on a public holiday which added to the thrall and the experience."
71,Revel in the beauty of these colossal and magnificent structures,You can easily explore the Pyramids by yourself. We spent about 3 hours roaming around the site just enjoying the sites and we got the best pictures. We arrived at 9am when the gates opened. The key is to not follow anyone even if they try and convince you they are official’s they will try and get atleast 300 Egyptian pounds out of you of you follow them. Just tell them you did not bring extra cash and they will leave you be quickly.
72,A MUST see!!!,No place on earth beats this! This is the most amazing place on earth. Show casing what man can achieve! This is my second time here and still as impressive as the first time. If there is one place on earth that needs to be top of your bucket list it should be the pyramids The only thing that annoyed me is the tourists discarding plastic bottles and rubbish and a complete disregard to its history by climbing the pyramid.
73,amazing view but keep alert !,"A must see! Something to tick off the bucket list. There’s nothing quite like seeing the amazing pyramids, I would definitely recommend this site to anyone wanting to experience this wonder of the world"
74,"Great but beware of the locals, they will bother you the whole time.","Been dreaming to see pyramids since I was kid and now I saw and touched them. AMAZING structure, I really believe they are made by alien. Entrance fee 200EP, alot of people will try to make money, if you speak in arabic better so if you want to refuse you can tell them, some are aggresive telling you why im refusing them and not minding them, i only tell them I want to be alone and say no thank you. Guards also will not help you, you are really on your own but be firm and smile, they just want to make a living.One guy told me I can go up in one of the stones, eventually guards whistled on me and says not allowed. Funny that he will not say anything to the guy only to me that its not allowed. Anyways overall pyramids are worth it. I didnt go inside the pyramid for me seeing them up close and touched them is enough. I Dont want to ruin something inside or even outside. Teenage locals are very friendly with foreigner. ❤"
75,Ancient Egypt Must See,"My guide and drive took me out to the Pyramids at Giza...not hardly a soul around. Just mind numbing. Also did the touristy camel ride and photo, corny but will worth it This will be a highlight of your life"
76,Must see,You can’t go to Cairo and not visit the pyramids at least once ! We went with Emo Tours and the guide was great. Extra 400 EGP to go into the Tomb of the Great Pyramid but well worth it. We skipped the camel ride but loved the Boat Museum. Spinx is cool too.
77,Ancient behemoth,"Still can't believe that I saw the pyramids last week. When we decided to book a last minute holiday to Sharm el Sheikh last week, we did not plan to visit Cairo, but we decided to book the day trip by flight with Redsea rep at the hotel. We spent nearly 2hrs here. Loved every minute! I am not a fan of dark, narrow places. So we didn't go inside."
78,Ask for the panorama location also,"Seeing and touching the Pyramids is the experience of a lifetime. The pyramids are made of stone blocks about a meter cubed. How these heavy blocks were hoisted up and placed in correct position to build these huge structures over four millennia ago is a wonder. There is an entry to the tunnel going into the pyramid at about 15-20 ft. height above the ground level. The public can enter and walk into the tunnel for a short distance, paying an entry fee. We reached the Pyramids before 7 am, but there were already several tourist buses in the parking area. In another hour the crowd of tourists had swelled. Its best to reach early."
79,Stunning and dissapointed at same time,"to see the Pyramids...yeah! we left Cairo early in the AM with a tour guide...but one could easily do without one by just taking a taxi...there is a security check at the entrance and then you will stand in front of the Pyramid(s)...wow...after all these years...still magnificent! We paid for the tickets to get inside...hmmm...glad we did it, but it was not cheap...you don’t see much or anything actually...if you are a short person it is much easier to go thru those low bearing tunnels/walls then when your are tall...my husband and I had a hard time...never mind how careful we were we sometimes hit our heads on the very low ceiling...climbing up the wooden ramp is fine, but ....it is narrow and you climb for a while with people going up AND down at the same time...it gets super crowded and hot in there AND it is super humid even though we went in December! Everyone was sweating...from climbing up and bending down and twisting the body to fit ...Can’t imagine to pay to go inside on a real hot day...and do not bring any bags inside or cameras hanging around your neck! Crossbody bags/cameras will drag on the ground since u are hardly ever in an upright position...backpacks will hit the ceilings and get super dusty and in case u have knee problems or can’t bend like a pretzel or if u r claustrophobic...don’t go! I am sorry to spoil it for some who read my review, but there is no camouflaging what one will experience! The same you go in and up...the same way u come down and out...so check the line before going in and decide for yourself! We are glad we did it, but besides saying that we were inside a Pyramid...there was nothing much to see!"
80,Pyramids of Giza,Must see sight in Egypt. Very touristic but worth it. Bring a bunch of small bills either dollars or $10 Egyptian pounds to tip everyone for everything.
81,historic place,"When you are in Egypt, of course you are there for the Pyramids of Giza. I would advise staying in Giza and not Cairo so you can avoid the terrible Cairo traffic."
82,Wonders of the world ,"One of the world's wonder situated in Cairo Egypt. You must visit at least once in your lifetime. You can buy the combined ticket to see the Plateau, the Great pyramid and the boat museum, which is 500 Egyptian pounds. make sure you are wearing comfortable walking shoes and a good covered dress for walking and climbing. It is a great experience to walk bending your body in the tunnel to reach the inner chambers of the Pyramid. unfortunately the inner chamber is empty. This is a must-visit in Egypt."
83,WOW,"After visiting the Great Pyramid and before the Sphinx, our tour guide took us to a location that provided a panoramic view of several pyramids. As usual, camel rides and souvenirs were also plentiful."
84,"Good, but lots of hawkers","You know you will visit them, and you should. The site is very quite accessible and has vehicles access points and paved roads. We decided not to enter any of them, but besides and entered Titi’s at Saqqara. We only had one bad experience and it was caused by the narrow staircases to the Khafre Pyramid, Caucasians of American and European tongs where arrogant and self centered as not to accommodate people trying to go down the staircase and exit the site. They will block the staircase and not only take no actions when you plead that the wait at the lower entry point, they will make fun of you if you ask them politely. That’s what we get from pro polar movement in their countries."
85,"Amazing Place, Some Hassling","the pyramids should only be visited on line. the experience of being targeted and ripped off by everybody is not worth it. i found the experience dishartening. I felt vulnerable, disappointed and mostly disgusted by the deceit displayed. we got a taxi from the airport to our hotel and he suggested he drive us around for the day for US$55 which we agreed to. He put us in situations where we felt trapped and where more money was demanded from us. at the citadel he bought the tickets and when asked what I owed him he said he would tell me later. He organised a guide which I think must have been his mother who asked for 600 pounds, he then said we owed him 950 pounds which should have been 200 pounds each. then to top it off the driver demanded $55US each. It was akin to being mugged in the street. the option not to pay seemed dangerous as it could lead to police being called who I presume would take the locals side. If you must see the pyramids organise a credible tour guide and DO NOT GET A TAXI FROM THE AIRPORT."
86,"awesome, stunning",Mind blowing experience. Arrived very early in the morning and we have the whole place to ourselves. Truly a must visit attraction / place in our  lifetime.  
87,Climbing inside pyramid is done lonly because it is there,"Pyramids& Sphinx are a must see in Egypt. To be up close and touch the pyramids is surreal. Our guide Reham did a an fantastic job explains the history of the 5 pyramids. In the evening, we had a new tour guide who met us for the Sound and light show at the Pyramids and Sphinx. Reem had a great evening planned for us and treated us like VIPs. We watched the light and sound show snuggled up under a blanket I. Our comfortable chairs( blankets are available to rent on site if needed). After the historical presentation, we dined in a local restaurant with traditional mixed grill."
88,Man fears time; Time fears the Pyramids: Take your time,"Great place. Be sure to go inside and see the tunnel, gallery and kings chamber..not for the unfit or claustrophobic. DO NOT show your ticket to anyone but the doorman. Be sure to go on the camel ride"
89,Best way to visit The Great Pyramids of Giza?,"Of course, its the reason why all tourists come to Egypt in thousands every year.  An Engineering Marvel, Huge Structure, Beauty meets the expectation.  Many things to do in the Giza Complex.The entire place is called Giza Platea which hosts # great Pyramids along with 6 small ones for queens and many small ones. Of course not to forget the old and mysterious Sphinx (believed to be of 8000-12000yrs old).We started the tour with the Light and Sound Show in the evening. Bit disappointed and not that impressive for all of us. The light part is fine but the sound part not clear and not something that makes you cling on.Next-day Morning we went to Giza Plateau to witness the wonders. Mesmerised by the view of 3 pyramids. You need to buy an additional ticket to enter into the largest Pyramid and its worth and must buy. You will witness the chamber deep inside the Pyramid after passing through 2-3 channels.  Very old people and pregnant ladies or people with back issues, better avoid as you have to bend and climb narrow ducts.Not to miss the massive sphinx located in the same plateau. Another must do will be - Camel Ride around the Pyramids (1 hr) or a ride on Horse cart which is, of course, more comfortable). They charge some 350 EGP for camel per person. For the horse cart, they charge for 3 people and take the fourth one for free if you negotiate."
90,A beautiful piece of history ,"My hubby & I spent an amazing 4 hours at the Giza Pyramids, Sphynx & temple. We took a taxi from the Cairo Island area to the entrance road for 77 EP. We walked up to the site stopping for a general admission ticket of 200 EP each & an additional 100 EP each to go inside the smaller pyramid. The 400 EP to go inside the great pyramid was a bit high for our budget. We wandered around the larger pyramids & went inside the smaller one before negotiating a camel ride - 200 EP for the two of us. We rode out in to the desert for a great photo of the Pyramids & then walked all thru the workers houses/tombs at the base of the pyramids. That was so interesting!! Notice the hieroglyphics above the doors & the carvings on the walls inside. Most of the doors have metal gates keeping you out but you can still look inside. We did find one area without a closure & went down into a tomb with an empty Sarcophagus. So cool!! We wandered thru the workers area until we got to the Sphynx. We were the only ones going thru them...a great way to avoid the crowds. After finishing up that area, we walked out the gate & down the Giza way road. We took a Mirco bus for 4 EP several miles to the Giza Metro. We chose to walk about an hour to our guest house, stopping at a little local restaurant for a great meal of 1/2 chicken, 2 kinds of soup, a dish of cucumber & tomatoes & flatbread for 67 EP. A fun...fairly inexpensive way to visit the pyramids!"
91,Learn how to deal with scammers.,Loved seeing the pyramids live. Try not to do the camel rides as we avoided those so camels didn't have to be put through the cruelty of walking in the hot sun. But otherwise we did ATVs around the pyramids as well on a different day and every time i saw them it was such a magical experience. Would return again just to live in that moment!
92,Such a magical experience,"A must visit while in Egypt! Get there early and walk/crawl to the center of the pyramid! Unforgettable! Then a camel ride is a must. January and February are great times to go, not hot!"
93,Hell on EARTH!!!!!!!,"The pyramids are as beautiful as they are humbling from a far. When you get close they are covered in graffiti and surrounded by people trying to take your money.Never let anyone take your photo if they ask to, they will ask. We found another couple, clearly tourists. All the ornaments people will try to sell you are worth £2/$2/€2 and no more. Kids may approch you, whatever they try it's probably a scam. Literally 100% ignore anyone asking where your from.Definitely go and visit the pyramids they are a world wonder, but be savvy, they are surrounded by bad people. Allow three hours to cover the whole site."
94,Bucket list,"It's so big! Has solid stone construction, but severe signs of wear. Not convenient to restaurants or shopping."
95,Independent day trip ,"Beware. The Egyptian government has set fees that can be charged for camel, horse, carriage rides. It's 200 Egyptian pounds to enter the area. I cringe when I hear people pay 100's of euros that cost no where near that amount."
96,seeing the pyramids is one thing,"People will try to convince you to take a tour of the site, if only to avoid the touts. That is a perfectly fine way to visit but you don’t have to. We took a taxi to the entrance and just walked through the site on our own. We are reasonably fit but it is only a 30 minute walk to go straight through. We took our time and spent almost 2 hours, but that was with a lot of sitting to take in the views, taking photos, wandering, etc. The exit is by the Sphinx where you can enjoy lunch at the Pizza Hut and take in the views of the pyramids while you eat."
97,Unique,I had a great time visiting the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt ' ticket cost is 200 Egyptian pound about $13US ..U have 3 option to explore the religion ' either by taking a walk around ' or ride a camel they will try to make u pay more as a foreigner so make sure to bargain ' or u…
98,Giza Pyramid Tour (Do not use Wagin Alfy),"My wife and I booked a tour to visit the Pyramids of Giza in January, 2019.  The temperature that morning was 41 degrees which was a shock in the desert.  Our chilliness quickly disappeared upon our arrival at the pyramids.  They are magnificent!  Much larger in person than I imagined.  We then took a horse and buggy ride through the desert to the sphinx, which was amazing, but smaller than I imagined.  One could also take a camel ride between the pyramids and the sphinx.  All in all, one of the best travel days we've ever had.  If you've always wanted to see the pyramids and incredible ancient temples (we visited 12), meet incredibly nice people and and eat great  Egyptian food, go now.  The American Dollar is extremely strong against the Egyptian Pound, so for little money, you too can live like a Pharaoh."
99,Take them all!,A wonderful experience in this wonderful place along with my partner. We very much enjoyed being here. It is doubtless a Wonder.
100,I made it...,Nice visit - no need to go in. Take a camel/horse/chariot ride to see all 9 (!!) pyramids at the same time!
101,Bucket list ticked !!,"I had carried a photo of the pyramids from a 1950's Nat Geo spread, in my memory.  I am sorry to say I was disappointed by the fact that my hotel was directly across the street .. urban sprawl had marred my expectations.  I would also suggest that you do your research (lots of video on YouTube) before visiting and go on your own.  Spend the entire day, make sure you have water and a lunch.  Take your time!  On the positive side .. one more thing checked off of my UNESCO list."
102,You don’t need a tour if you don’t want one,"There's no words to capture the beauty of the Pyramids, but here are traveler tips.  Be prepared to be annoyed and harassed - don't be rude, just ignore all the people asking you where.you are from and making small talk.  Be weary of children,  they are just as hawkish.  Camel rides and horse rides can be fun, but negotiate a good rate.  Don't let anyone walk with you or offer to take your pictures,  ask another tourist, they'll be accommodating.  200 pounds per foreigner and bring your own water."
103,Best visit ,The staff of savior Tours is very professional and friendly. they add value to my visit. the places i visited are wonderful and the oriental food is delicious
104,Beautiful Experience,The first thing to see in Cairo since this is what you think of when you go to Egypt.  Many sites as you travel are more interesting. but this is iconic.
105,It is unbelievable,"An amazing wonder of the world with so much to see. Get here early to beat the crowds and avoid making eye contact or responding to people who try to sell you something or ""help"" you with stuff. There are many known scams posted here so familiarize yourself with them to get the best out of the experience."
106,Excellent services,"My partner and I had always wanted to visit the pyramids and we were not disappointed. We stayed in a hotel with a rooftop terrace overlooking the pyramids so we woke up each morning to the amazing views and we took a half day private tour around them and really enjoyed hearing all about the history of the pyramids. They truly are incredible, we even went inside the largest one. Definitely worth the trip to see them with your own eyes..."
107,Wonder at the heart of City!,"Worth exploring and doing on horse back.  It is like stepping back in time.  We didn’t go inside, just all around on horse back.  It will be an unforgettable memory."
108,What can one add?,"I have always wanted to visit the pyramids since I was a small boy, and this year I eventually managed to see them.I was on an organized tour, and although our trip was cut short by the outbreak of the corona virus we managed to visit the site which was truly a spectacular experience, one I am glad I have done.The pyramids are awe-inspiring, a must see place if you are in Egypt.There were very few people there at the time we visited, great for pictures, but not so good being hassled by people selling all types of souvenirs, wanting to take your picture, or trying to get you on a camel.Along with the pyramids, The Sphinx is also a fantastic sight to behold.  It is far longer than I thought it was.You can go in the pyramid, but I did not take that option up, and don't know what the cost is.Adjacent to the great pyramid is a museum housing the Solar boat, also known as the Khufu ship.  It has been reconstructed, and is a whopping 143 feet long.  There is a small entrance fee but it is well worth looking at."
109,Our trip to cairo,"A lifetime dream came true for me. It was beyond all expectations. First we saw the pyramids lit up at night and it was amazing. Then we went with our tour group during the day. We were led to the front and the back views. Don't forget to include the solar boat museum in your visit. the photo ops were phenomenal and I was able to get a local to take incredible pictures with myself and the sphinx and the pyramids. You can see examples online and the locals are there to take the pictures and make some tips. On another note, be careful when you scale the pyramids to the entry inside. Watch where you step and know your limitations. Just standing next to one of the blocks gives you the perspective of the enormity.Also be firm with the hawkers and do not make eye contact or answer them.I feel blessed that I saw the remaining ancient seventh wonder of the world."
110,No words to express my feelings!,"I'm happy to say, that I visited pyramids on the best way! No waiting on the entry :D  only short stop in the door of our plane and then ready-set-go and jump!!!!! Definitely the best way to visit pyramids is to skydive there! :D"
111,Beautiful views BUT,"The pyramids do not disappoint- extremely awe inspiring and simply impressive. There aren't a TON of people here as you may see at other attractions across the world (I was here on a Saturday in December), and you can manage to get pictures without others in them. I would highly…"
112,One of the most beautiful sight in the world,I really enjoyed the great Pyramids of Giza. I recommend to go early due to getting so busy around noon.
113,All part of the Experience...,"It’s not simply what they are, it’s the thinking that went into their creation that makes this pyramid complex so amazing."
114,A good guide is a MUST on this visit!,"We visited Egypt with Memphis Tours and our guide in Cairo, Sam, was excellent.   We visited the three pyramids and then drove to a viewpoint for a good photo op looking back.   Sam showed us trenches in the rock around the second pyramid, where the workers would place wood, then wet it to have it expand and break out blocks of rock.   On our return from Aswan we walked around all three pyramids in about 2 hours.    There are some aggressive vendors on site but a simple ""La Shuukran""  - no thank you in Arabic - works wonders."
115,Beautiful and horrible at the same time,Paying extra to climb inside the great pyramid to get to an empty room that is poorly lite is on worth being able to say you did it. Lots of tourist and can be crowded on the stairs
116,Must see!,Step up to the great pyramid and be astounded. How did they build such a structure so long ago? Hop on a camel and take a ride across the sands to the famous sphinx. This is the best stop to get your favorite photo of the trip.
117,"Excellent history, monumental, and white trash","The pyramids assume huge area, and you need suitable transportation to fully enjoy the view. I used both private car and camel ride. I am not a great fan of camel ride, but it provides views which is not possible with car. It is not impossible to walk, but requires significant efforts. Things are a bit chaotic, so make arrangement before the visit"
118,Beware of scams. ,"beautiful site, architecture, shows you that people in the past did really have intelligence, each pyramids is built meticulously, tour guide gave us the history of the place as well, just totally awesome. one should be careful of the locals here, they say they will take a pic of you with your camera, then they hold you ransom for your camera, they expect your to pay them or else they wont give you your camera back. climbing into the pyramid was also good experience!"
119,Dream come true,"I visited Sakkara, Dashur, Giza Pyramids. It was a good experience. I used private driver Wagih Alfy. Please do not use Wagin Alfy or his provided drivers. He will provide some driver, who will just waste your time, by taking you to useless shops. Wagih provided driver George, who basically will take you to a provider, by saying only goverment agent and they will veryt much force you to make money. You do not need any such agent for the Pyramid tour.Caution: Do not use Wagin Alfy and do not bother calling. May be he was good oin the past, but not any more."
120,Simply the greatest building ever erected - and they say it’s 5000 years old,the visit to the pyramids is one of the most wonderful things that i realize in my life i realize my dream of child
121,Hell on earth for horses and camels,Magical experience. Very recommended I had an excellent guide called VICTOR from SUN PYRAMID TOUR. Very professional private van with A/C and WiFi all the way.
122,Amazing Time at the pyramids ,"If you get to Cairo when the new museum is on line  late 2020 you will find one GIGANTIC modern museum  to tour, along with some sort of transportation system that will get you to nearby Pyramids and Sphinx.  Our suggestion is SKIP staying in downtown Cairo, and book a room in one of the new hotels to be built in this area.You hear all sorts of “amazement” comments as to how the builders of the pyramid got it so level = Well that is obvious!!!!! = when you see the shallow carved out channels in the bedrock = that were filled with water to set an even plumb (water seeks its own level), as one gigantic simple level reference.Most of the smooth facade limestone that covered the external surface of all three pyramids has been removed, with the exception of the second pyramid of Khafre where those stones are still at the peak only.  The smooth cap stones (if they were still in place) would have extended the pyramid out a good 20 ft. at the corners and sides.Over the years of modern time those smooth cap stones were quarried off to be used as building blocks for today's city of Cairo proper.  This removal of the cover stone allows us to view the MASSIVE internal stones that make up the bulk of the structures.  Tom noted that the lower layers of stones are rather massive, but as you go up, the stones (da) get a little smaller.There is much speculation on how they got those stones up the levels of the structure, but with all the sand around here, it is obvious = sand or mud brick ramps would be the easiest format.Next to each of the Pyramids are smaller Queens Pyramids, and we did decent down about 40 ft. along a very narrow corridor into and down into the bedrock below.  No charge for going in there --but I tell you it was a tight squeeze.  Two out of our group went into the big pyramid (cost $180# = about $12 US PP, but we opted out of that one as there was so much more to see outside during our limited time at this location.There are 5 long pits carved into the bedrock around Khufu’s Pyramid.  Three were found empty, but in one a wonderful artifact was found = The Pharaohs solar boat to the afterlife.  She is 90 ft. long and made out of cedar.  When discovered under 41 MASSIVE blocks it was totally disassembled (1224 pieces), and it took conservators 5 years to slowly reconstruct.  Mud found on her bottom planks indicate this boat was actually used by the pharaoh, and now the craft is totally assembled and enclosed within a walk around display (but NO video allowed inside).  This craft / like the food the pharaoh would need, was supposed to be magically reconstructed / provided within one of the spells he had memorized (or were “cliff notes” to him written on the inside of his burial chamber).This craft was VERY IMPRESSIVE to me as I build wood models of sailing craft."
123,Surreal,You will be taken back when you see the actual size of the pyramid.Amazing and out if this world. One of the best wonders of the world.You will also see many other pyramids in the same location. Si its not only the 3 you see in the pictures.
124,Giza Pyramids self guided tour,"People won’t leave you alone at the pyramids and they lie about their affiliation with the government to push you to buy their service as a guide. They won’t leave you alone until you pay them, even annoying you when you walk away from them. Just to get peace and quiet to enjoy the sight you need to give them money. The government should remove these people and let the tourist explore the sights. I really hated seeing parents sending their kids begging, poetry is a issue and you must try to help as much as you can as a tourist but the Ruined my trip to the pyramids , trying to meditate and observe the pyramids."
125,Fundamental awe,"Well, I finally got to see it. After so many history classes and lectures, finally getting to actually be in the location and witness these ancient buildings in real life was a thrill. And then it was over. Personally, it did not hold that much majesty for awe for me - at least for very long. I much prefer the Saqqara pyramids and ruins. I really enjoyed visiting and entering the Bent pyramid of Sinefru. But it's a must see when you're here. Just get ready for a little bit of walking and some crowds. I did not have to walk much as I was on a tour with a private car. I had no desire to ride on a camel or horse or any other creature."
126,Wonderful visit to the pyramids of Giza,"I was only 14 when I went to the Great pyramids. But I loved them so much I thought one day I’d get round to reviewing, so here goes. The harsh scent of cigarette smoke filled my nostrils as my mum lit her third cigarette of the morning. She was arguing with the bus driver again about the no smoking sign above her. I didn’t care, I had nearly wet myself again with excitement at the prospect of the pyramids. Suddenly the mist of Cairo parted and 3 transcendent shapes bore down upon us. This time I actually did wet myself, again to the vocal disgust of my mother. I recommended going inside the larger pyramid, it’s thin on oxygen hence funny to watch fat people sweat at the exit. Great day out."
127,Uber to pyramids,This place is just magical it has something special a special vibrate! It's full of energy and you get easily get a special connection with the universe. I advise to get a guide who explain you everything about the history otherwise you wouldn't appraise what you have in front of your eyes. Take the camel ride to get closer to the pyramids. An amazing construction that only beings from another planet could build.
128,Pyramids and Meuseum Tour,I went there already for the 3rd time and every time it is even more magical. You can just walk around or go inside of a pyramid for extra costs. Do not accept a camel ride or any other service while walking around. Usually you are first seeing the two biggest pyramids and then you go with your driver or guide to a scenic area where you have a spectacular view. Especially in the afternoon.
129,Breathtaking But Annoying,"I truly got amazed by the first moment I set foot in the desert. A dream was unraveled in the sight of my eyes and I enjoyed at the most The great Pyramid, the small one and the Sphinx.. Thank god I managed to see one of the seven wonders of the world. I’m gonna be back soon😉"
130,Be the First!  ,"For epic photos with the Great Pyramid, be sure to ride the camels where you will be taken to a spot where the views of the pyramids are at their best. You won't regret the (bumpy ride)"
131,SCAMMERS BE AWARE!!,"Being one of the hottest ‘must-sees’ in the world, the best way to view this is on a private tour and to get in early just after the gates open. We accomplished this and were rewarded with a more leisurely look at what the ancient Egyptians created for their Pharoahs and nobles. Half an hour after arrival, the buses poured in with the accompanying hordes. By that time we had moved on to the other viewing sites. Take your time to view the pyramids from different angles and wander over to view the sphinx from an elevated angle - not the usual ground level shot. These ancient monuments are best viewed without too many visitors around to be able to capture the beauty and incredible efforts put in."
132,MUST SEE,"My friends and I visited the Giza pyramids as part of a two week itinerary prepared by Botros Travel BTS. The tour was called The Magic OF Egypt Tour, and for my first trip overseas that's what it was. We first went to the Great Pyramid so we could go inside before the large number of tourists appeared. When you stand next to the pyramid and the blocks that were used to construct it, you realize for the first time how small you are compared to the engineering marvel of making the building blocks and the pyramid itself. Pictures in book do not do justice to the dimensional difference. We started climbing the path to the entrance above the ground level. Do not consider doing this part of the tour unless you feel sure footed and have no difficulties with rough surfaces. You get to the entrance and show your special ticket. You are not permitted to bring a camera, but you can bring a cell phone (with camera). Our tour guide then walked around the Great Pyramid explaining construction, history, and special views. I can not recommend Egypt enough as a destination and totally recommend booking a tour,  Egypt is not easy to get around or book things. The guys at BTS Botros Travel really did look after us,  the whole itinerary was so well thought out and can't believe how much was in the tour for what we paid... highly recommend!!"
133,Annoying people,"We traveled with a Road Scholar group of 20 and an Egyptology professional who has been guiding for over 30 years. I highly recommend engaging a professional guide when you visit such a historic place, since you will learn so much more about the history, archaeology, and geology; the experience will be far more meaningful than just staring up at a giant stack of rocks!  After reading some of the 1-star reviews here, I am even more grateful that we were accompanied everywhere by an experienced, trustworthy guide. Rip-off artists, scammers, and overly aggressive vendors are everywhere that tourists visit and you will find yourself in some very uncomfortable and possibly dangerous situations if you try to do this on  your own.As expected, seeing the pyramids in person is mind blowing! To stand in the shadow of structures that were erected ~4,500 years ago is indescribable. The best view is from the far side, away from the entrance where you can gain a great perspective of the relative size of the 3 large pyramids and how they dwarf the more modern city of Cairo. The weather in early March was perfect; though it was sunny, it was in the low 70's and there was a pleasant breeze and beautiful skies.The only negatives are the people who climb all over the stones, in spite of the ""No Climbing"" signs. And the swarms of aggressive tchotchke vendors are really annoying. They should be kept away from the monuments and confined to the exits.  The camel jockeys are also aggressive, but our guide arranged for the rides and payment, and we didn't have to handle the negotiating and tipping (though they did try to extort us for additional tips just to take our pictures). I was also shocked at the amount of plastic trash at this place, and many other temples and tombs throughout Egypt. The unemployment rate in Egypt is very high, but it would seem wise for the Department of Antiquities to hire more people to keep these fantastic treasures clean, tidy and safe."
134,Amazing historical place,"There was so many touts and brokers to whip you, but I was lucky that I am saved by my UBER Driver. He saved us all the way and took us to inside the premise. We walked around and took photos and enjoyed the areas."
135,Evidence of ancient civilisation,"Christmas week was packed, buses upon upon buses of tourists. Everyone is trying to scam you so it's good to have a guide. Nothing is free or a dollar, dont fall for it. Go at opening to avoid the crowds."
136,amazing!!!,"It pains me to give the Giza Necropolis anything less than 5 stars. But the way this place is run makes it almost impossible to enjoy. The monuments do not disappoint — their scale and mystery cannot be overstated. The Sphinx is also a site to behold. HOWEVER! The touts and hawkers are brutal, especially if you are traveling solo. I understand their predicament, but even security will give you the run around and tell you that you need to take a camel (you do not!). So BE FIRM with anyone who approaches you, unless you would like to purchase their services. Go EARLY to beat the tour buses (there will be over a hundred of them by 10-11:00). And maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to appreciate the pyramids, in spite of the shameful job that the Egyptian Government has done in maintaining this cultural wonder."
137,Egypt 10 days wonderful.,For our honeymoon me and my wife booked this as part of a trip to Egypt There are alot of pushy people here trying to constantly sell you rubbish all you have to do is ignore them The area is huge and worth spending some time here Price for entry to the site is reasonable but you will need to pay again to gain entry to the pyramid Going into the pyramid isnt for anyone who is lesser abled as it is a steep narrow clostaphobic tunnel down
138,Giza on a cold day!,"Go to the Panoramic point to see all the three pyramids together. You don't need a guide for the tour. Also, visit the Great Sphinx. The view of 5000-year-old monuments in front of you is just WOW. "
139,Reliving the Mystery of the Pyramids,"You can pay to enter the pyramid but it's a blank wall, empty tomb and you have to crouch. Beware of hustlers. One guy flashed me what I think was a tour guide badge, told me he was security and I was in trouble. But..if I let him take my picture for a few dollars he would let me go. I started laughing uncontrollably but he followed me for at least 15 minutes about the picture."
140,Beautiful creations by Pharaohs ,Great place to visit. A little bit dirty but it's to be expected with so many people visiting. We visited with a guide - hired off-site. You may loose important fact visiting on your own.
141,this is a must-see attraction,Forget everything you have seen on the internet and read in books. This is something you have to experience for yourself.
142,Awesome Experience,"I've dreamed about seeing these since a very young age! Finally, @ 72 my dreams have come  true.  Our bus took us here around 8 a.m. All o can say is W O W!!! So majestic, so mysterious, so beautiful. I stood and stared at them and tried to imagine the workers with their superiors actually building them. My feeble brain could not comprehend it. Giza Pyramids is one of the highlights of my life. And to top it off I got to ride a camel at the low cost of 3$$$! It was a very cool ride and my new best animal is a camel. They are the sweetest, docile animals. I loved the way they sit with their front kegs vent under them and more their heads around to watch all the crazy tourists. After the camel stood up with me on her, I thought oh my, am I gonna skip off? They are TALL animals! She started walking and it was down a little hill and that freaked me out a little, but I stayed on her and really started to enjoy the ride!   The beautiful deserts of Cairo have stolen my heart!"
143,Best.Trip.Ever!!!,"A visit to Egypt is incomplete without visiting the Pyramids of Giza. This was on the second day of our itinerary. We set off early to avoid the crowd and the hot weather. We were in awe when we actually set foot on the grounds of the pyramids. It was a dream come true for most of us to actually see the pyramids which was one of the Seven Wonders Of The World.We had a camel ride as well and it was quite an experience. As it was part of our tour package, we did not have to haggle over the price with the camel guy. We tipped USD1 to the camel guy who took many funny pictures for us.Yes, we will visit the pyramids again if we were to visit Egypt as we can’t get enough of them."
144,"Awesome pyramids, super touristy and crowded!",Definitely worth a visit. One of most impressive structures I’ve ever seen. Go early or late to avoid crowds. Sphinx is close by.
145,Amazing wonder of the world,"It was a great experience. We were a family group of ladies .. was safe!amazing view and in person stepping on HISTORY was great!.... The city in general, we didn't enjoy (food, shops, etc). But sightseeing was the only thing in Cairo we enjoyed."
146,"If you didn't visit this iconic structure, are you even visiting Egypt?",the pyramids are huge and it was so hot there sand i liked the indide there are stone creatures there are fake doors there are lotsof  atractons there
147,Magnificent! ,"We had two days in Cairo and noticed that many tour operators pick you up at your hotels at 8am with a full jam packed itinerary incl the markets and a few other sites.  We opted to start a bit later after a leisurely breakfast, so took an Uber to Giza instead.  The driver dropped us off quite close to the ticket office where we purchased tickets and did the full tour on our own.  We had to avoid many “volunteer” tour guides along the way and enjoyed the site.  It is a bit tiring constantly warding off unwanted tour guides, but once you walk the plains and see the pyramids and Sphinx - it’s worth it.  Plus we paid a quarter of the cost vs going with a tour company.  We toured Islamic Cairo as well as the Khan el Khalil markets and a few other sites in the same way.  It was great."
148,Must see in Egypt,"They are a sight to see from  distance...the nearer you get the worse they become. They are covered in plastic bags, plastic bottles and worse. No effort has been made to keep them vaguely pleasant to visit. Plagued by various sorts of officials and non-officials looking for bakshish (and more). It's a shame."
149,Professional cheaters,"Pyramids of Giza is the pinnacle of our visit to Egypt. There are 3 pyramids close to each other surrounded by few small ones. We visited in December and the temperature was very comfortable and this must be the best time to visit. To enter the interior chamber of one you need to buy additional ticket for 400 Egyptian Pounds. You will enter through a narrow opening and climb up sometimes crawling up to the chamber. After going that far, we really wanted to have that experience and that was truly wonderful."
150,"A must do, but be prepared",The best place to visit And see how great was the ancient Egypt my famil y were happy weather in January was 17 degrees
151,Phenomenal,"Wear good walking shoes, hat and take water with you. It can get very hot walking around these pyramids. You have to line up to go inside the pyramids but the lines move quickly. Beware of sellers wanting you to buy souvenirs. If they think you are slightly interested they will not leave you alone. The pyramids are huge and involve a bit of walking  but worth the visit."
152,Obviously a must-see,"At running to see them, they are always photographed as if they are in the middle of nowhere, however the city of Cairo is just the other side of the river. You could venture down into one of the pyramids but it was too hot, and it was difficult to breath as it was hotter inside than out. Too many people pushing and shoving to make it a pleasurable experience. Camel rides were on offer to go round all the pyramids and other things to see, however so.e people complained they were made to pay more money to get off the camels once the walk was kver. Lots of people selling souvenirs and they where all competing for money. I am glad I visited but was disappointed in lots of the trip."
153,It is truly a wonder of the world,"Absolutely breathtaking.  Seeing them up close was amazing. Yes, riding the camels were a must. They looked healthy and we watched them being fed alfalfa.  The size of the blocks are so much bigger than what you can see in pictures."
154,Pyramids,"Incomprehensible that these were built when they were built.  Suggest you get off the road and approach on foot.  Then the true scale of these structures becomes apparent.  And you miss 98% of the hawkers.  Give yourself a couple of hours, especially early or late in the day, to explore in and around each pyramid.  Avoid the “guards” who encourage you to climb the pyramid and then will charge you."
155,This is Egypt,"My first glimpse of the Giza pyramids was from a van. Suddenly, there they were in the distance, the tops peeking out from behind buildings in the congested Giza suburb. Finally, to see firsthand the oldest and only surviving ancient wonder of the world, inscribed a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979! My heart was racing! And soon, it was even racing more, thanks to a sunset ATV adventure that provided panoramic pyramid views from the desert side. What an amazing experience as we zipped up and down sand dunes with the pyramids as a backdrop. A few mornings later, we returned with a Gate 1 Tour and entered through the Main Gate. This was a more typical tourist experience with masses of people and buses lined up. The area is so large though, it didn’t feel crowded once we passed through security. Now we could get up close and personal with the pyramids (no climbing allowed). You really appreciate their massive size standing next to them! For a fee, you can go inside. We opted to enter the smaller tomb of Queen Hetepheres which was free and provided a similar experience. During both pyramid visits, we were under the watchful eye of experienced guides and given instructions on do’s and don’ts. If you’re prepared, the inevitable hassles won’t spoil your visit at this world wonder."
156,Prepare logistics before visit,"On my last trip 20 years ago, there were no entrances, no fences, no entry fee, no paved parking lot, no hoards of tourists, & vendors were not allowed. All this is now present. There is a line of cars & buses to the parking lot, police whistling at those in prohibited areas, hundreds of tourists climbing to the entrance of Khufu, horse carts, camel vendors, & those pesky vendors with scarves, postcards, clay pyramids, etc. They are relentless, you no sooner get rid of one & the next comes along. Do not fall for the ""accept this as a free gift because I'm so happy you're visiting my country.""  They will literally put it in your hands, then ask for a tip. Nothing is free.We did escape to the outer edges of the plateau where there were less crowds & a great view of all 3 pyramids, plus queens' pyramids."
157,Brilliant,Arrive early to beat the crowds. We were on a tour and the tour director provided us with lots of background information regarding the pyramids and the builders thereof. I opted to go into the pyramid to view the burial chamber. It is not worth the 400 EGP cost. Air pollution…
158,Majestic monuments,most popular attraction place when you visit Cairo is the Pyramids of Giza . One of the wonders of the world and you must see it and enjoy taking some great pictures there. 
159,It's why your going to Egypt...,The sunset is free from any of the restaurants by the south side of the pyramids. Try at ask if there’s any restaurant with a terrace and you won’t be disappointed. You’ll only have to pay for the food but it’s equally delicious.
160,"Yep, They're Big!",its one of the most places i advice every one to visit to see how its built and how still stand until now you will really enjoy .............you must visit
161,No place on earth beats this! ,"I hope my experience can be of any help to many of you. From central Cairo I took the metro to Giza station. On the way out I was asking to a guy where to take the bus being Giza plateau far away from the metro. He gave me directions, meanwhile a man in its early fifties with his young son offered to walk me to catch the bus being themselves heading to the pyramids. I normally refuse help from any that looks like a tourists hunter but on this case I accepted the help. Down the street an unauthorized taxi driver offered to drive us for 10EGP. Very cheap considering that a taxi driver was offering me a deal for 30EGP.On the taxi the man offered me to help to enter for a cheaper price. I had no reason to suspect looking such encounter very random. I wanted to pay the taxi but he didn't let me paying it himself. I knew that entrance price was 200EGP with the right to visit one pyramid inside. A guard of the plateau stopped us offering help to enter. They were offered me 3 options on horse back: small,  medium and large tour. Large tour was 900EGP, so I opted for the medium but now the medium tour price had become 900EGP. I showed that all I had with me where 600EGP plus some spare money. The man met at metro offered me to walk together to an ATM but luckily I had no cards with me. So it looked that I had obtained as bargain the large trip for 600EGP. I paid my money and the other man with his son said to the guys: ""Here are my 100$"" but there was only an acting of money passing. He handshaked passing no money. In that moment I understood I paid for the 3 of us. Fortunately we split with the excuse that Egyptians have different gate to enter. Now was the turn of the improvised guide to squeeze me the last pounds. With an English bases at top with 10 words we began our visit on horseback. First stop, to the big pyramid he invited to follow a guy that let me climb few steps of the pyramid (thing illegal) until a guard invited me to step down. For this help to brake the rules the man asked me a tip. Of the few money left I offered him 10EGP. He argued it was too little and I could get rid off of him until I gave all I had (26EGP) apart 50EGP I wanted to save to my way back to the Cairo. Actually he was pretending to give him at least the 50EGP. I asked the guide not to make me do anything would suppose a fee or a tip because I had no money left. We moved to the second pyramid offering to visit it for a fee. I said to him that that pyramid was included in the entrance so he let me go and they asked me the entrance ticket. Than it was when I realised that I didn't have any ticket and that they made me sneak in. I told them I was with the guide and him with a sign made them understand to let me in. After that he carried me close to some holes in the ground that were supposed to be tombs. After that the tour for him was finished. I said that that was even less than the small tour. He agreed to carry me to the Sphynx. Naturally the entrance was not included. Not happy, he asked me a tip for his work as guide. Which? He'll couldn't speak English! He wanted to rip me my last 50EGP.I  said 400EGP for one hour horseback was far too much, no reason for him to expect a tip. He said that 400EGP was really a cheap price. Luckily they were my last money left otherwise I would let him steal even more money and I left avoiding any discussion. An hour later a man approached me offering a horse ride for the same tour, he asked me 200EGP, naturally I was not interested, he lowered to 100EGP and after that to 50EGP.My experience with Egyptian is honestly that they are very nice people, apart from those in Giza plateau that are professional cheaters."
162,Pyramids to wonder ,"Beautiful sights however, You get bombarded with Egyptians coming over to you trying to give you things, trying to get you to sit on the camel.. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS. They will say ' oh you are from UK or Germany etc' Here is a free gift... DO NOT ACCEPT THIS.. .they will just come after you asking for money. As soon as you get off the bus - 5/10 men all surround you.  I had one Egyptian man following me and my partner all the way around the pyramid telling me that i need to give him money. I got very angry and told him to go... Eventually he went. We then ran out of time on our excursion and had to go... So we couldn't enjoy ANY of it!!!"
163,No pic can describe how incredible this site is.,"Beautiful historical place , visit is a must , you can feel the history and see the wonders sometimes the line to buy the tickets is long , you get all these people running  behind trying to sell you suvenires and take you around on horses and camels , well that's normal but do not accept any price without at least 50% discount ."
164,Impressive structures,"Easy bullet points.*Piles of trash everywhere, even inside the monuments.* Animal abuse. Camels bleeding where the straps are, horses harshly whipped and overworked (If you go please don't even pay them to take pictures).*So called guides don't respect monuments, and allow people to get on the pyramids to eat and take pictures. Security will say nothing!*People kindly offer to take pictures of you, and then they want to charge you $20 USD. I know this will not detour you from going, but at least know what to expect!"
165,Pyramid tour with Tour guide,"I arrived in Cairo a few days before my 2-week tour of Egypt began I decided to go the Sound & LIght Show at the Giza Pyramids because it was not included on my official tour itinerary. The woman who took my ticket asked if I wanted to take a tour of the pyramids the next day. Even though it was included in my offficial tour that was going to start a few days later I thought why not see them twice?I am so glad I did!!! The next day I took a taxi to the Giza pyramids and met my tour guide at the entrance. We stopped to take pictures in front of the Sphinx. Then we went up the hill to the Great Pyramid and I paid extra to go inside climb up to the sarcaphogas. It is straight uphill and it is literally 150 degrees inside the pyramid. I sweat like a pig and did not want to take any pictures after that. A few days later on my 2-week Gate 1 tour of Egypt we took a tour bus to the Giza pyramids. First we stopped at the Great Pyramid. (No one on my 50-person bus paid to go inside the Great Pyramid!!! The tour guide told me in the past the entire bus would go).I'm glad that I had already climbed to the top of the Great Pyramid because it left me covered in sweat and we had 2 more photo stops to go.Next we went up a hill and took pictures with all 3 pyramids in the background. Several people on my tour bus paid to ride a camel. I was too afraid but I walked over to take a picture of the camels. Of course all of my tour guide members asked me to take their picture on top of the camels. The lead camel guy took my picture in front of some of the camels (see attached). This is Egypt so of course he charged me for it. I am an animal rights activist. Whenever I travel I bring a small carryon suitcase on wheels full of cat and dog food everywhere I go.PLEASE BRING DOG AND CAT FOOD TO THE GIZA PYRAMIDS!!! There are beautiful dogs at the pyramids (see attached photo) and cats eating out of dumpsters outside of the pyramid complex. (Ask your taxi driver to stop at a pet store. Or bring some with you in your suitcase).After the 2011 Revolution tourism dropped off in Egypt. (Inflation is still skyrocketing). People could no longer afford to feed their horses and camels and the animals were starving.There is no animal control in Egypt. Volunteers started rescues such as ESMA (Egyptian Society of Mercy for Animals). ESMA began feeding the horses and camels in Giza. They incurred huge debts and had to stop last year. Please make an online donation!!! I visited the ESMA cat and dog sanctuary in Sakkara near the giant statue of Ramses II (you can go too!) and am now paying my tithes to them every time I get paid. When my taxi driver was driving me to the Giza pyramid complex I filmed a man feeding 2 horses out of a  garbage dumpsters. I was hysterical. When I met my tour guide and he told me that we were going to take a horse drawn carriage to the Great Pyramid I cried even harder.I told him I can't do it. The walk is too much for me. I didnt know what to do. My horse carriage driver told me he loves his horse, his horse is his best friend,and he does not use a whip. He is an animal lover (he has dogs at home) and as we were going around he fed dogs all over the complex with the dog food I had brought.After my tour the pyramid complex was closing.  I showed my tour guide and my horse carriage driver the video of the man feeding his 2 horses out of the garbage dumpster. They recognized the guy and were furious. My horse carriage driver told me, ""That guy made money off of his horses today!!!We drove past where all of the working horses and camels of Giza were being fed after carrying tourists all day. I bought 10 large bales of hay from a stand. (After your tour PLEASE buy hay from a hay stand and feed any horses that look skinny!!!)We drove over to feed the horses that belong to the guy in the video. My tour guide and horse carriage driver both started cursing at the guy in Arabic.I filmed the entire thing but did not know what they were saying. At a later date I was in the back seat of a taxi watching the video and my devout Muslim taxi driver - who I did not even know was listening - turned to me and said, ""They cannot use those words in front of a woman!!! Don't repeat those words to any Egyptian."" LOL as if I could figure out how to prounounce what they were saying.The Giza Pyramid complex officially closes at 4pm, but people don't trickle out until 4:30-5:00pm.The English Sound & LIght Show starts at 7:00pm from October-April. Doors open I think at 6:00pm. After you tour the pyramids you can eat dinner at a nearby restaurant and then go back for the light show. (It is a seperate ticket. The show costs $19(.I recommend you pay a few dollars extra for VIP seating (first few rows). If you arrive a few minutes early chances are great that you will get a front row seat and can take fantastic pictures and video."
166,Breathtaking,Don't get sucked in to the hawkers and tourist traps inside the grounds. buy a ticket and just walk!
167,Bucket list item - DELIVERED,"Loved the pyramids. Its as majestic as expected. It was crowded like crazy.  Best to visit early in the day to get better pictures.Inside of the pyramid is awesome as well. if you are claustrophobic, its not for you, since you will be squatting your way up and down. There were many who returned without completing since the crouch space was small."
168,Always a Wonder,"We visited first thing in the morning with our guide.  While there were certainly people there it didn't seem overcrowded.The structures are immense and really a marvel when you contemplate how long ago they were created. Our guide educated us about how not to engage with the folks who are selling things. While at first I thought we were being rude, I definitely understood why you need to walk by without acknowledging as they can be quite persistent.We climbed up part way to get some great photos but skipped the tunnel underneath.Our guide took us around to the other side to take a camel ride which was a lot of fun and provided some awesome picture opportunities.Obviously this is a must see when in Cairo."
169,Our first full day in Cairo,"The first time you see the Pyramid, it could bring tears to tour eyes. You will soon get over with the excitement. The thing is how it was built , will always remain a mystery. A must see once in lifetime."
170,Wow,"It has been a few years since my visit but just must say that I have traveled to many country's and places on this earth and the top of the list will always be the Pyramids of Giza!As others have mentioned I stood in awe of the pyramids despite how much I read beforehand and videos and photos I saw, just an incredible sight to behold.A MUST VISIT for any person at least once in this life and hopefully more in the afterlife!"
171,Pyramids and Tomb,Stayed at Pyramid HotelDinner on rooftop to watch for free the lightshowALIBABA ALADDIN and all the staff were incredibly welcoming - treasures of GIZA
172,Checked off bucket list,Disappointed was expecting more and it was hot 🥵 Also something should be done about the beggars scrounging Nothing much to see wish I’d stayed in the bar at the hotel
173,Great to see with your own two eyes,"First when we got their our Uber driver and ""so called"" travel guide got into a fight at the gate the guy was running after our car because the guide was trying to make money from us. Luckily the uber driver was their to assist us. Then we were looking for a ATM to withdrawal more cash on our way there it was an overflow of people wanting money from us the one guy started shouting at us because we didnt want to exchange money from him.eventually we went inside.This was a very bad experience, The people who claims to work inside the pyramids was the whole time trying to Hustle money some way out of us they did not stop. We where robbed 400Egp from the one old guy. A group of children was following us for a while just taking picture's they did not understand when we said no. When my partner and i want to take pictures of one another in front of the pyramids they run up and smile for the camera when we Chase them they just step back one foot. Going to a place like this should be a experience and one would want to take pictures but we did not have a chance. We could see that this didnt only bother us but other tourists as well. We did not even enjoyed to have a peaceful view at the structures because people was all over us. The only relaxing thing was the boat museum no one without a ticket could go through. Some advice when you go, go whith a group of people and whith a professional tour guide."
174,Dreams came true.,"Our trip to Cairo couldn't have been better. Thanks to Hosni who organised our 3day stay just perfectly. We couldn't have asked for a better guide and driver and hospitality shown by Hosni Pyramid was simply great,Thanks"
175,"An experience, but watch out if first time to Egypt! ","You're finally here, standing at the foot of the Pyramids of Egypt! So do yourself a favor and see it all. Go into every open pyramid, see the open tombs in the mastaba fields, walk on that sand, see the Sphynx. It's a long day but you'll have memories for a lifetime."
176,Extraordinary experience !!,"We had a tour guide and car booked from hotel which covered saqqer, giza and some Egyptian market . He was great , good service with lunch covered . We had awesome time . Although one piece of advise here that we realized later - its better and more reasonable to take local tours , DONT GET BOOKED THROUGH HOTEL - you will easily get almost half the price which your hotel staff will book for you"
177,Breathtaking and must visit,"We met our tour guide Hesham Elhaddad in Cairo.  And for the next 21 days we had the pleasure of his knowledge, care and sense of fun.A group of mature travelers most with extensive knowledge in Egytology, we were very impressed with his knowledge. No doubt attributed to his studies in Egytology at university. We extensively traveled throughout the country in very remote areas,  no problems at all.Would happily recommend him."
178,One of The Seven Wonders of the World,It’s one thing to see pictures but it is another thing to see it in person.  To think about how they were built thousands of years ago is a feat in itself and to learn how far they brought the stones just blows your mind.  It is also cool to see the view of Giza while standing on the pyramids.
179,Ride the Camel!,"Bit disappointing when you arrive. Lots of persitant hawkers and very crowded. Looks nothing like the views you see on TV, when presumably they clear the site. After walking round the great Pyramid, we went further away where there is a better view from the opposite side to the…"
180,Excellent,Still amazing to visit the pyramids a second time around. Do pay the extra entry for solar boat exhibit as it is not a reproduction. It is so well displayed and very well documented with photographs of initial discovery and actual ‘pit’ where it was discovered.
181,Great to Experience but be aware of the Tour Guides,This has been a must visit in my to do list.Definitely a must visit and it will leave you with an everlasting memoryDo not miss to visit the inside of the medium sized pyramidThe camel ride isn't much worth as they promise to take you close to the pyramids and they don't
182,The incredible society of the ancient world,"Arrive early so that you can avoid all the tour buses and crowds. They let people in 15 minutes prior to the open. I would use the entrance near the Marriott Mean House. Your cab or uber driver can take you right to the ticket office. While we were in the car driving towards the area, multiple people tried to stop the car to get us to use them for their camels or tours. Just tell the driver to keep going to the entrance. Once you get your tickets, which can ONLY be paid in CASH (once again I still can't believe that with the amount of tourists that visit, that cash is the only method of payment) you will go through security and can start wandering the site. We chose to do it on our own as we like going at our own pace. Be aware that people will ask to see your tickets near the entrance. They basically ask to see them, even though they don't work there, and try to walk with you and talk to you about the pyramids. They simply do this to try and make money. The pyramids are unbelievable. Hard to imagine that this was built over 3000 years ago.Once we finished wandering around, we decided to get a camel to take us out the look out point to see all the pyramids from far and to take some awesome photos. Here's the deal with the camels. They will start VERY high when you talk to them. The guy quoted us 400 EGP per camel for one our to take us out there but not to where all the tourists go (which was actually better so that we were able to take photos without the crowds). I had read prior to going that they will try to hustle you since you are a tourist and that they should be willing to take half of what they are originally offering. I told him I wouldn't pay more than 200 EGP for 2 camels for one hour. He kept working down on his price but I stood my ground and finally agreed to the price. It took him about 10 minutes of following us non stop to finally agreeing to that price. BEWARE THOUGH, that when we were getting back to the pyramids, exactly 1 hour from when. we left, the guy tried to tell us we were 2 hours and now it was double. Again, stick to your ground and don't let them trick you into anything. We tipped the workers 100 EGP each (2 guys with the camels) they were ungrateful at fist so we can an extra 20 EGP and still wanted more so I told them I'll take back all the tip and he walked away. Riding the camel was an AMAZING experience. Just have patience and don't agree to the first price they give you."
183,Seventh wonder,These landmarks that also include the Sphinx cannot be missed and do not disappoint.Next to one of the pyramids is a small museum displaying a very large boat that was discovered nearby and has been reconstructed.Amazingly beautiful and over 4000 years old
184,Disappointing experience,"We were a group of ten (ages 21-45) my sister and I took our kids and their friends and we had a great experience.  From the horse and camel rides, to the cheesy photo options, everything was perfect.  I recommend that if you plan to go, you take a guide with you that will help facilitate your experience and help to avoid being approached by people every two minutes.  Negotiate a deal from the start to include photos, camel and horse rides to the panoramic view, and help you negotiate appropriate prices for souvenirs.  They were all very friendly and accommodating and took photos with our telephones without incident.  If you can find him, ask for “Kaboreya” he was forthcoming with prices and is worth a bit extra to guarantee that you don’t get hustled along the way."
185,Egypt as you'd imagine it!,"After much preparation we were on our way to Cairo. Coming from the Caribbean it was a long journey, but it was sooooo worth it! Being able to see it and actually touch it, omg it was awe inspiring! There were a lot of people or hustlers trying to sell you stuff, they were totally harmless and not aggressive just trying to earn an honest dollar. while there was a crowd, we were able to get great photos as we had the most wonderful tour guide who was super knowledgeable. Definitely worth doing again."
186,Wow,"The malnourished horses and camels, the constant annoyance of everyone looking for ""baksheesh"" (tips) for doing nothing, the constant misdirection hoping for a windfall, etc, etc... Yes, its all part of the experience of visiting the Pyramids- and been for a couple hundred years or so! This does not detract from the fact that these are ""The Pyramids"" and a deserved bucket list location  across the world. The feeling and views are stunning despite the annoyances. A half say walking around the Pyramids feeling small is reinvigorating.Obviously, a must see if in Cairo- don't let the annoyances bring you down! (Mentally Prepare, though!)."
187,We went to see the Pyramids!,"Worst experience ever.Zero tourist expect few Chinese and mainly locals.Very big dissapoitment, the site is not kept clean.Expect people and scammers to harasse you for everything from camel's ride worth 100 pounds but asking $160 to souvenirs. People won't stop being on your tails.Horses and camels are in very bad shapes and treated like crap.Pyramids and site are falling apart as it ain't well maintained.Very disappointed, workers and scammers there are some the worst people on the planet and still have so much to learn in order to treat people nice and fairly and keep having those tourist back."
188,Magnificent ,A great and breathtaking place. Recommend you to have more free time when you are there. Mine wasn’t enough. I would go back there if I have the chance.
189,Must See in Your Lifetime,"Make sure you have a good tour guide, the hasslers can be a bit overwhelming. You can also go inside"
190,Speechless,"We got an early (8:15am) start before the temperature rises and the crowds arrive, into the Pyramids of Giza, the last remaining wonder of the ancient world.  After buying our entry tickets  at the east gate and then getting checked by a “ticket” guy, he told us to follow him as his direction was the way to the pyramids.  Soon after we started to follow him, we felt off, so we left him to go our way, which much to our relief, he didn’t follow us nor forcefully make us re-follow him.  Apparently  he was making us go the long way, through the vendors so we can buy trinkets before seeing the pyramids.  Avoid eye contacts with vendors, camel people if you don't want to buy anything.To enter the inside of the pyramids, you need to buy the other tickets at the main gate.  (reviews of pyramids under each one)"
191,Pyramids of Giza - just an amazing sight.,"£1=20LeDay trip from Hurghada to Cairo with MTS tours. 200Le. Entrance or £10.I've been to Egypt so many times and seen people fall foul to thr charms of thr locals, so I say this with caution before I review. Please DO NOT hand anyone you camera or phone as you will be paying to get it back! Or let anyone guide you, as there services will cost you too, because they will make you pay an exorbortent fee for there services. Just politely refuse all attempts of help, plus the stuff they are trying to sell you is extremely cheap imitation and not worth your hard earned money, if you want something, always barta the price to one third of thr original, if they want the business they will except. OK, the Pyramids are a seventh wonder and considering how close to the main city that gets chocked by nearly 12,000 car fumes daily, I'm surprised they are in the condition they are after 3000 years. This is a site that will have anyone in ore, just beware of vendors trying to sell you things, or give you camel and horse rides, plus the local pack of dogs that roam free. The site spreads over many acres and consists of 12 pyramids, 3 large and 9 small. If you want to go inside thr great Pyramid it will cost an extra 400Le. or £20. If you want to see one free, there is a queen's pyramid (small) that you can venture into, but beware the shaft down is about a metre square and if you get clodtrophobia, I really wouldn't, as it is hot and sticky inside. The highlight was the Sphinx, which was nearing the end of thrle day and the pictures are amazing, especially if you get them at the right angle you will get in the pyramids in the background. Amazing site, but a little let down by the lack of security around the vendors, and the reason for only 4/5."
192,Great place! Avoid the locals!,"Arrived at around 10am, there are various entry pass options and combination for the pyramids and has inner view pass alongwith outer view pass.There are a total of 9 pyramids in the complex with the big three having major attraction coz of history involved.There is the grand pyramid, the great pyramid and the pyramid. They are an absolute marvel as building that a structure 4609 years ago without any modern tools must have been a Herculean task. Must visit place in the world, the experience is totally different. Restroom facilities, are there as well as physically handicapped also has good facilities (though not at the pyramids).The only thing missing is that it should mention somewhere that while entering the pyramid, some physical activity is to be done like crawling and excessive bending. Good market nearby for shopping local stuff."
193,Better than you can imagine,"If you love history ans adventures, this in the perfect place for you. You will meet a lot of new and passionated people just like you. You will be impresed about the piramids and about people."
194,No wonder... Its one of the 7 Wonders  of the world,"2/10 second time here, this time felt right to review. Would not recommend, far too hot and sand everywhere. Not great"
195,Pyramid Complex closes 4-5pm. Sound & Light Show opens at 7:00pm,"From the moment we walked in, we were hassled by almost anyone that could see us alone together doing our own thing and not getting on a camel or horse carriage. The pyramids are beautiful and the views are spectacular. What I didn’t like is the mistreatment of the animals, they look overworked, underfed, and unhygienic. There really needs to be some standards imposed to take care of the poor animals.  I did not want to entertain animal cruelty but we were just not left alone for a moment. Regardless of your views on the topic, just be aware, and don’t engage in conversations, there is no such thing as free advice in this place. If they give you advice and you ask a question, they will follow you till give in. Luckily I had a strong travel partner to play bad cop!"
196,Great History,"Learn to say no to the hawkers, the cameleers and the horse and cart drivers you'll be fine. Need to be quite fit to climb up inside the great pyramid but it's an amazing experience if you do"
197,AMAZING!!!,"One of best site to visit while you are in Egypt, if you have layover or connecting flight for more than 6 hours in Cairo International Airport then you must take out time and plan your visit to see pyramid. It is not very far from Airport, we reached to Pyramid site within 30-45 min drive .If you are going for proper vacation for 3-5 days then you can enjoy desert safaris, boat ride on river Nile in the evening with on-board cultural programme n dinner, camel ride etc . There r good hotel to stay.It is good place of interest if you are into history and a lover of sculptures artwork n craft."
198,Amazing,"FULL OF SCAMMERS!Beware of scammers, everyone is out there to steal your money, check my picture. This man said I cannot drive straight and forced me to a sketchy parking lot near the entrance, he said don't worry about price, when we parked he told me to get on the camel and instead of taking me to the prymids he took me to a corner and 10 random men showed up and they robbed me of 200USD. They then blocked my car with their car so I couldn't leave until I paid .  The police didn't even care they passed us. I had to scream and scream until they moved my call"
199,Please don’t make these the only site you see,"So, interestingly enough, the father has the largest, the son the next larger in size, and the grandson has the smallest in size.  Life possessions are inside the pyramids, along with the tomb of the indiviual"
200,Absolutely amazing,"We 7 people from Thailand all first time visit Egypt, Great thank for Sun Pyramid for fully supported, We enjoyed all of program at Giza -Aswan-Luxor-Alexandrea. Millions thank for Supper guide Mohamed and Sadoon who give fully detail if Egyptian Kingdom seem we we came back to 4000 years ago, Thank you team at Bahariya for nice Dessert Camping and wonderful meal there, all drivers were polite and punctually."
201,I remain in awe of these magnificent pyramids!,"Tour is ameging. We went first time to Egypt with Memphis Tour and we feel very nice and safe. They all are good and cooperative. We feel very safe with Memphis. From our side we are highly satisfied and I recommend others to go Egypt with Memphis. Team from Memphis is 5 Star, helpful, patient and willing to adjust to make our vacation special. Actually they take care of everything. I thank to our Cairo guide Ahmed Helal for his good guidence and cooperativeness with us. I also thank to all the guides and drivers who are really cooperative with us. They are very good and professional with high quality. Really you can trust them. You did a very good job and I really appreciate that. Thank you all, thanks."
202,Awesome wonder of the old world,"Went to visit pyramids with family. Suggesting to stay close to pyramid area,u get very good view of pyramids from your hotel ,or even from your room.if u take pyramid view rooms,u can see glimpse of light and sound show of pyramid In evening. Suggesting to stay careful about your belongings while viewing pyramids,as chance of losing some articles there ,if u are not careful."
203,It's so big!,"PLEASE STAY ALERT while doing any activity in pyramids area, no matter you are going to ride camel or carriage , make sure ""how much ""the fee and the most important: asking directly ""how much tips you want"" , and everything they do in the trip you better making sure ""how much this cost"" just remember, nothing is free ~~~or you will be ripped off so badly"
204,One of the seven wonders ,"This experience was unforgettable. It made a deep and lasting impression.  Really, really amazing.  I had some misgivings about going so far for a tour but I am happy that I went."
