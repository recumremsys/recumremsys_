0,great visit great guides.,Lovely to visit the type of houses my mom grew up in. Lovely bit of Brum history preserved. the guides are great. definitely worth a visit
1,Memories of my childhood,Easy to find and great tour of the buildings. Amazing to still have these kind of houses  to see and touch and feel. Terrific staff and worth the money. Hard to imagine how people lived back in the day. A hard life but very well put together.
2,Interesting,"I learned fascinating stories about the families who lived there.  Easy to get to and well laid out.  An unusual NT attraction, all about the poor rather than the wealthy"
3,Excellent  trip,Wonderful guided tour of the back to back houses. Gave you a real insight of times gone by brought to life by Jeff the excellent guide.
4,A fascinating trip through Birmingham's history,Great exhibition of old houses. Guide was amazing and the houses although small were a joy to visit. So much history and a great display on how life was through the ages. Fab for all ages. Staff very helpful and enthusiastic.
5,Even the kids enjoyed ,Book in advance. The kids loved it. Very good look in local Birmingham history and the way of life. Great guides. 5 stars!!!
6,A little Gem,Well worth a visit if you are in Birmingham..looking back at how people used to live! Good knowledge from enthusiactic guides
7,Last minute decision but great couple of hours,"Very interesting onsite on how people used to live in the back to back houses, my wife was brought up in a  back to back house and she thought these were a bit posh to what she lived in . Tour guide was very informative and very pleasant"
8,An excellent way to learn about some of the social history of Birmingham.,Wonderful glimpse into Birmingham’s past. Great guided trip with knowledgeable volunteer. A real sense of how Birmingham was the workshop of the world. Also how such harsh poverty was endured by the residents. Original buildings with steep staircases but the National Trust have added some rails to assist modern visitors!
9,2 days and 1 night stay in Birmingham,"Very interesting. Took me back to my grandmas house. Good funny guide, who really knew his stuff. Need to be fit as lots of stairs, some very steep."
10,Excellent,"What an interesting place. Full of memories of our childhood days, although we are not as old as the houses. Our guide, Jeff was very knowledgeable and backed that up with great humour. He made sure everyone was involved, especially the children. Thanks for a great 2 hours."
11,Captivating piece of history in a corner of Brum,"Fascinating insight into the once very abundant workers' cottages. Interesting to see their evolution from 1840 to 1970. Fantastic guide called Charles who provided just the right amount of information delivered with some nice humour. The tour included a tailor's workshop and a sweet shop, all this so close to the centre of Birmingham. The complex is an easy walk from New Street Station."
12,Enjoyable afternoon ,A great guide told us about the remarkable families who lived in these small back to back houses minus running water and sanitation and yet who prospered through hard work and support for each other. It is a fabulous National Trust building with timed visits able to be booked on the internet with speedy reply.
13,Back in time,"An excellent few hours learning about the lives of people who lived in these historic houses. Our small group were led through each room by our very knowledgeable guide, Jean, who could draw from stories told by her own ancestors. Fabulous that these houses were saved from the destructive town planners of the 1970s and 1980s and then restored by the National Trust for the benefit of us all and future generations. Book ahead to be sure of getting to see these next time you are in Birmingham. Thoroughly recommend to everyone"
14,Back to the 1800s ,"A lovely experience, history in a time capsule.  So much to see and to learn about the past in Birmingham, and how wonderful that the National Trust has managed to save and restore these properties.  Our guide Jeff was very informative, and had a vast fund of knowledge about the area and what life was like here.  Well worth a visit, one could spend hours remembering and imagining.  Many thanks."
15,Back to Backs,A very informative guided tour. The volunteer brought the story of the houses very much to life.  Time well spent.
16,Sunday visit,"A great place to visit and see how people lived in the past, so interesting. The tour lasted about two hours and well worth the entrance fee, seeing the different rooms through the ages and waking up and down the narrow stairs the people who lived there actually used was great. The tour guide Jennifer was so good, very friendly, really knew her stuff and really made the visit. A definite must see when visiting Birmingham"
17,Birmingham History,Been past heremany times and unaware it was here. Great piece of social history and well worth a visit
18,Backs,"A guided tour here is a real insight into life in Birmingham through the ages.  The back to back houses are an absolute gem and if you're fortunate enough to have Jeff as your guide you'll be entertained throughout by his stories and quips.  A fascinating experience for all ages so long as you can manage the narrow, twisting stairs."
19,Nan loved it ,"These houses are charmingly full of history and have been restored so well. You have to book in on a tour to visit but lady who took us round was amazing, full of knowledge, funny and answered any question thrown at her. Most rooms but the last few you are allowed to touch things, which my curiosity in how things were and worked was awesome. All the rooms were brimming with stories and items. There's also a sweet shop and a gift shop. If you're early they have a little room upstairs from the gift shop/reception which you can wander round in. Well worth a visit and losing yourself in time for a few hours. No cafe but lots and lots of places to eat. I'm only going to post one pic because it would spoil the surprises that lie in wait."
20,A Gem of a Place,Visited today Brum Back to Backs.. city central .. Easy to get to from train stations . Tour guide John  full of knowledge and made the tour so enjoyable. Booking essential as tours only and you can do this on National Trust website or APP..Takes about 1.5hrs..Very steep  spiral stairs so not suitable for wheelchairs as no lifts  .. Would recommend if you go to Brum to relive days gone by .. loved it .. Don’t forget to visit the little sweet shop there ..
21,Brilliant Birmingham Back-to-Backs,"Took an elderly friend that was born and lived in a back to back in Hurst Street. That plus an excellent guide made for a very special day. Visitors from all over the globe seemed enthralled with the stories, a must see for anyone visiting Birmingham, great trip for locals too."
22,Step back in time ,"Interesting tour, showing how the working-class used to live in the 1840s onwards. John was very knowledgable, answers questions, he was very witty. Very entertaining. Worth the visit when you go to Birmingham right at the city center. Although you have to make a booking though, we just got lucky people cancelled so we were accommodated"
23,Say what about Goesunder and throwing out babies in bath water....??🤪,Ggood trip to a interesting site to find out loads about Birmingham my family  is from Birmingham which is interesting
24,Loved it!,"Definitely  worth a visit, amazing insight into ordinary people's lives, and life in birmingham before it became the big city it is now."
25,"Very interesting tour, would reccommend it.","Wonderful slice of history, beautifully restored and presented,able to handle objects. Knowledgable guides who had a good rapport with the visitors, Alison and Jeff, thank you."
26,Fascinating,Very informative tour. More than expected. Rich in history with real stories told. Perhaps more time for questions but overall OK.
27,Fantastic museum,A great NationalTrust day out in the city centre! Well preserved courtyard of back to back houses from various points in history and lots of information from the guided tours. You need to book a timed slot though!
28,Social history at it's most interesting .,"Well worth the visit to this slice of life in Birmingham from the Victorian era to the 1970s. Our tour guide was Ross, who filled the tour with facts and anecdotes, really bringing it all to life. From the Levi’s to Mrs. Mekin and George Saunders... I could picture them all. The only thing I would say is think twice if you’re not good with stairs, or at least wear comfortable shoes. Loved it!!!"
29,Excellent,Really interesting from local guide who really knows his stuff. Excellent gave insight into how people lived and worked. Keep up the good work NT volunteers. We really appreciate it.
30,A trip back in time,Most National Trusts are grand homes. This was a great intro into Birmingham's past. Also my 8 yr old loved it.
31,Excellent,Amazed at how people lived in the not so distant past. My father lived in one of these with 8 brothers and sisters. How they survived I don't know. Tour led by a very knowledgeable lady who answered all our questions with such passion. Our next visitors to Birmingham will certainly be taken on the tour. Well with it.
32,Excellent fabulous Les !,"great visit to back to backs, shown round by tour guide John, who was fascinating.  My 9 and 6 year olds also really enjoyed it"
33,Fascinating insight into life in The Back to Backs.,"Many of the historical places you can visit  are stately homes and castles. However,  instead of learning how Lords and Ladies spent their hours of leisure, here you gain an insight into the lives of every day, skilled working class people. These are the people who made Birmingham one of the most important industrial centres of the world.Our tour leader, Di, was excellent. A local woman with local knowledge, she was very engaging. You are allowed to handle objects, which is unusual for a NT property.Wear sturdy footwear as there are many steep spiral staircases to climb. Don’t forget that tours need to be booked in advance. Our tour took about 1 hour 45 minutes."
34,Well worth a visit,An amazing day with so much history. Great guide “Des” had some many stories. Makes you realise the every day luxuries we take for granted. So close on your doorstep and easily overlooked but a must see place. A lot of steep steps but good handrails around the properties which have been loving recreated. Central Birmingham with lots to see and do. Well done national trust.
35,History,Visited here with friends. We had a marvellous guide called Pat who took us through the history of 200 years. The national trust have done a fantastic renovation of this property. Highly recommend this attraction.
36,Fascinating,Great few hours spent on the back to back tour. Tour guides really informative and lots to see. Staff very friendly and helpful. Really good place to find out about life in the back to backs and Birmingham. The attraction is centrally located - 5 minutes walk from the main stations or park in the Arcadian car park. You have to book on a tour in advance. Don’t miss the sweet shop after your tour!
37,Well worth a visit!,Back to Backs is a must see in Birmingham.  A historical site that was restored with heart and respect.  Details are carefully displayed to let visitors share a piece of the history of Birmingham.  I especially would like to thank Joyce for the wonderful and informative tour.
38,Jennifer,"Fascinating to see this ""yard"" of preserved and restored back-to-backs, and to discover how their occupancy changed over the years. The buildings and the artefacts were interesting enough in themselves, but our volunteer guide (Carl) brought them to life with his stories of the people who lived there, and his knowledge and humour made for an even more enjoyable and educational visit."
39,Birmingham live and housing over the last 200 years,Over whelmed by our Tour of Back to Backs.  Very interesting visit and very sad stories regarding all families who lived their. What great history for Birmingham too.There were 12 of us in our group from all walks of life/countries. Jeff and Alison our tour guides were so passionate about there job too.  George Saunders what an amazing guy and to have lived there until 2000 too.  Old sweet shop is almost a must to finish off our visit.
40,Our guide Dave was amazing!,"I visited the back to back houses with my parents and two children (9 and 6). Our tour guide (John, I think was called) was great. He made the tour come to life by telling us stories about the families that once lived in the house and including a bit of audience participation. The tour was informative and interactive and enjoyed by all 3 generations of our family. The traditional sweet shop being a highlight for the children. I great family day out!"
41,Fascinating ,"Visited this National Trust property and both myself and my 12 year old daughter loved the walk through time. Enjoyed leaning about the history of the buildings and of how Birmingham grew and the stroke of luck an how the buildings were saved. Our tour guide (Jane) was very friendly and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend a visit, just make sure you book ahead of time."
42,Second visit as good as the first,"Great tour really informative interesting learning about the history of these houses, enjoyed the tour of the site with Ross who was really good telling us all about the people who lived there and businesses that were there"
43,fascinating and educational,This row of shops and houses is a real part of “living history” and brings to life the times of an age gone by. Well preserved and the shop frontage of Hurst Street are functional shops. It is also quite an interesting blend of old and new with the architecture. A must do in Birmingham
44,Amazing day out,"Very good tour, the guide really made it. Easy to miss what a dreadful life it must have been in the early 19th C as it feels quite cosy, but once the guide describes the reality (rats, ""midden"" piles, mud, damp, bugs, poisenous food, overcrowding, average life span 24yrs) you kind of get the message! Both educational and entertaining."
45,Best thing in Brum,"What a lovely place to visit, I visited with relations as they used to live in Birmingham as little children. It was a great tour, very informative with good humour from our tour guide 'jeff w'. Very steep stairs so be warned, also book in advance. Would 100% recommend - lovely day out."
46,Excellent ,I have been to Birmingham Hippodrome a view times but never knew Back to Backs was there. The guide Jeff was informative and made the tour interesting. This is a great museum to hear of the hardships and lives of the people who lived there. Well worth a visit.
47,Excellent-fun and very informative ,We enjoyed a wonderfully informative tour of the only remaining back to back houses in Birmingham. Our guide Carl was fabulous. Really knowledgeable and entertaining.
48,Wonderful,To visit this in the heart of Birmingham is a joy. So glad they didn't knock it down like everything else in the 60s.
49,Excellent ,Fantastic insight to life from the late 1800’s to 1970’s.A must do tour for brummies and all. A couple of hours well spent.
50,Experience Time Travel in Birmingham,"I’ve visited the houses a few times and every time I love the experience, the small tour groups give an immersive, personal and exciting look through history in the different areas of the houses. I would really recommend this to get a taste of birmingham history throughout the years. The only downside would be the accessibility of the houses but this cannot be helped due to their age. Highly recommend, I’ve visited the attraction at various ages (13,17) and enjoyed every second of it."
51,Fabulous trip to The Back to Backs ,We are National Trust members & visited the Back to Back houses in Birmingham. The tour guide Anne was extremely knowledgable & we learnt fascinating facts about these houses & the people who lived there. It was also a very interesting history lesson. Anne made the tour interactive and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The tour took about 1 1/2 hours but you need to give yourself longer as there is a sweet shop on the corner that's worth a visit.
52,A Chilling Experience ,"Absolutely great place to spend a couple of hours when in Birmingham.Our visit was brought to life by our guide Jeff (with a J) who was both informative and humourous. It was great to hear tales of the actual occupants, the history of whom Jeff obviously has a passion.It's incredible to think that these properties were still occupied in the relatively recent past.Thanks Jeff for a great afternoon."
53,Very Interesting tour,"Visited in non stop rain , Jeff was a superb guide , he gave us a very informative tour of the houses , we really enjoyed his extensive knowledge of life over the years . Thank goodness these houses have been preserved, well worth a visit , thank you ."
54,Fascinating tour of British social history,my mum grew up in houses like this and she loved explaining how we all lived in the good old days.. really interesting
55,Well worth booking,"Each guide has a slightly different take on the history of the houses and it is a fascinating experience - no wonder it is the no 1 attraction in Brum. The houses are cold in the winter [and sometimes in the summer-]and booking is necessary , but had a really  really lovely afternoon theer with an old friend who also enjoyed her first visit"
56,Brilliant place to visit,"Amazing look back in time to how people who came to Birmingham looking for work in this growing industrial city lived. The site is delicately and superbly restored. And our tour guide, Jeff (with a J!) told the stories of the actual families who lived there with such brilliant color that I felt we were there with them. Any history buff would love this tour. And if you’re looking for how the Peaky Blinders might have lived, you won’t be disappointed. So happy we did this tour!!"
57,Jane made this tour,"Very good to view and a must if your in brum, a great little taster of years ago in a city , you don’t expect this in a city and makes you realise how things have moved on , our tour guide was amazing knowledgeable and funny can’t remember her name , we did the 11.30 tour on Sunday 15 September , she made it great thankyou lady ,"
58,"Context, variety and humour ","In summary, as the tour guide said at some point of the visit: there’s lots of mansions, manors and aristocratic houses to visit, which represented the minority of the population in the industrial revolutions (still this way)... then what about the majority? How the workers used to live during a time of massive urban growth? And why most of those dwellings were demolished? You’ll get to know the answers in this quite interesting visit IN-site. As He said: we are very lucky to manage the last back to backs in the city - Agreed. Thanks Jeff and National Trust for this opportunity! A grateful tourist."
59,Fascinating,"Really good educational resource for all ages. However, when I lived in one of these we had an asbestos panel in the attic room which could be broken, therefore giving an escape into the adjoining house backing onto ours!"
60,Excellent visit,The Back to Backs are well worth a visit to see the lifestyles of the working people in 19th and 20th century Birmingham. Our guide John was extremely knowledgeable and involved all the group with his anecdotes and activities and brought living in these houses to life. We learned a lot about the conditions and social history of life in the city.
61,Best national trust ,"Thanks to Neal our guide for showing us round the houses and telling the tales and stories of times past. Many thanks to the lady pin the sweet shop....well done we had a bostin time, cheers."
62, Very informative,"A fantastic look back at our local history, the Birmingham Back to Backs is a lovely escape from iPads and mobile phones. My husband and I booked the seasonal Candlelit Tour to see what the Back to Backs would have been like “back in the day”. Our tour guide (Geoff with a G not a J) was fantastic, interesting and funny. His personal connection to the Back to Backs, made it one of the best tours I’ve been on. Definitely not your usual National Trust, but this is a true gem in the heart of Birmingham, which shows you just how far we’ve come as a nation. In some ways for the better, but the loss of community we now have is a real shame when you learn how your neighbour would dry your washing for you if it rained on your washing day. Just amazing."
63,Definitely worth a visit!!,"Brilliant tour, Jeff was great and gave us loads of information and warnings about the stairs! My parents loved it! And the sweet shop lady who re opened as she was on her lunch but knew I wanted some sweets after my tour! U guys were great!"
64,Fantastic,"As my Mother was born in Birmingham it was a nostalgic tour for me. Sooooo interesting with a fabulous guide, Jennifer, giving us an insight into how industrial Birmingham was born and where the workers lived. Would highly recommend this tour, there are very steep stairs to negotiate, so you must be able to climb these.  A surprise at the end of the tour with the houses last occupant, I won’t do a “spoiler”.  Highly recommended."
65,Brill,"Such an interesting place made to come alive.  The tour, led by the brilliant Jeff, was fascinating - taking you through 200 years of history in 3 different houses.  Well worth the fee, the tour was interesting, funny and relaxed (you can sit in the chairs and on the beds and handle lots of items).  Thanks Jeff!"
66,Hidden gem,Geoff was an excellent guide. Very interesting as my Mother who was born in 1921 was brought up in a back to back in Oldham. To realise what life was like in those days was a moving experience. A must do for anyone who has an interest in History.
67,Interesting,Had an excellent visit our tour guide Wes was brilliant and he had also lived in the back to back houses when he was growing up so made the tour even better. there are a lot of stairs to climb but its worth it but also a ground floor tour as well. Hard to believe people had to live like that plenty of facts and interesting things to look at. If you are interested in Victorian Birmingham this tour is for you. you can also book a room and stay there but there is a six months waiting list.
68,Birmingham back to backs - industrial dwellings,"A brilliant historical experience, great social history as explained by Geoff out national trust guide by"
69,Visiting family 👪,"A fascinating tour of the Birmingham back to backs. Dave our tour guide made it come to life with his fascinating tales, so knowledgeable, a great way to spend a few hours. Highly recommend the tour."
70,This is a must! Loved it!,"Been planning to see this gem since the popular Peaky Blinders, it brings such an incredible insight you feel like your going back in time. We will be back"
71,Excellent tour,An interesting tour but not really suitable for children. It was quite long and restrictive! The sweet shop is great though.
72,Old brum as used to be,"This small museum is packed with detail. Nowadays we have no idea how people struggled to raise families 100 years ago, and this museum will open your eyes. Easy to find, just five minutes’ walk from New Street station’s Hill Street exit - it’s far better to travel by train to avoid the awful traffic congestion and difficulty parking a car."
73,Well worth a visit,"Quite a good experience tbh, it took us back to when we were kids cus our grandparents lived in similar houses, they had an old toilet outside with cut newspaper for toilet rolls and spiders galore. I don't know if they are currently getting school visits but they should cus it shows the hardship people had to go through to get where we are today. A good learning curve."
74,just by the Hippodrome these National Trust take you back in time,Interesting preservation of a way of life (and living conditions) that continued even up to the mid 1800’s up to the 1960’s not only in Birmingham but across the UK. Well worth a visit. We had visited the Jewellery Museum earlier and found an interesting link between the two places.NB: Booked tours only.
75,Fantastic History Tour,"Three generations of our family visited the Back to Backs this morning - age range from 9 to 67.  We found our guide, Dave, a previous resident in a Back to Back in another part of Birmngham, very engaging.  He brought to life how the families would have lived in the houses during different eras.  He was very knowledgeable and more than happy to answer any questions we, or the children, raised. The tour and visit took over two hours, but we didn't notice the minutes passing as were genuinely 'lost in time'."
76,National Trust Back to Backs,"Visited this week and found it incredibly interesting, our tour guide Ross was brilliant, he succeeded in making the history interesting and thought provoking. This was despite the best efforts of 2 young boys on the tour to disrupt things! Definitely recommended."
77,Back to Backs,One of the best places to visit it Birmingham. Jeff our tour guide made it so interesting and he had a great sense of humour.  You actually go into the houses and visit the Taylor's shop.  Definately worth a visit for tourists and locals.
78,Fascinating slice of history,"This place is amazing, so interesting and well worth the money for what you get.  Our tour guide Carl was brilliant and his knowledge was outstanding. He was great with the kids, polite, courteous and put lots of humour into the tour. The tour lasted just under 2 hours and was brilliant  I cant wait to go again as i have joined the NT."
79,A Must See,Oh wow i took my best freind here for her birthday what a place iit makes u realise how hard people had it yrs ago it certainly makes u realise how lucky we r today  wen u go into the houses  there set up for dinner yrs ago so ud c wot people cud afford to eat the loos were in a yard and had to b shared by so many familys they had little squares of newspaper for loo roll  u can c old ladies in their houses poking the fires to keep warm  then the guide takes u up the narrowest staircase ive ever seen to the bedrooms wheree if u were lucky ud have A blanket  it really makes u realise how lucky we are   everyone shud go here its so so interesting  really worth a look if u can u go  the guides r so good they make everyone feelcwelcome so u cud even go alone and not feel loney brilliant place to go sad but interesting
80,Excellent from start to finish,Although I’ve always lived in Birmingham this was the first time visiting this interesting National Trust experienceCame with friends from Essex who were fascinated by the amount of thought and detail which had gone into this projectA very enjoyable and informative hour and a half with a true “brummie” guideHighly recommended
81,Great social history,Very interesting tour with excellent guide Geoff. Who was both informative & funny.Wonderful find in the heart of Birmingham & well worth a visit.Would highly recommend for all ages except very young or anyone with mobility issues - as stairs up & down are lethal!
82,My birthday treat,"Important to book a visit and tour but we were ‘bumped up’ to an earlier one. Dave, our guide shared a wealth of information and personal experience. The tour lasted 90 minutes and time flew by. We travelled through over 100 years of how life was in the Back to Backs. So close to the city centre, easily accessible, mind out for the steep stairs though!"
83,Central Birmingham gem,"I visited the Back to Backs with my daughter this week as my birthday treat. Our tour guide was Jennifer who was very good. Jennifer made the tour for us, lots of information in a very interesting way and the tour flowed through the rooms/years. The houses had been furnished to different periods and had lots of artefacts which we were able to handle. Great value for money and although my (adult) daughter only went to accompany me she thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you."
84,Corner sweet shop,"Our guide,John made this a most entertaining as well as informative visit. The lives of the families that lived in these cramped houses were really brought to life as we clambered up and down narrow staircases. Having visited many grand National Trust halls and manor houses and experienced many excellent tours I can honestly say that the tour of these humble dwellings was the best!"
85,A must see,Great visit.  Guides very informative.  Would highly recommend.  Was very cold day which gave a better idea of what conditions would have been like in the 19th century.
86,Back to my childhood,Very interesting tourWas lovely you can touch items on displayOur guide was excellentGreat it was just a small group
87,Back to backs,"What a great way to spend a couple of hours. I never really understood what back to back houses truly meant despite my Husband having spent his early childhood in one. Our guide Geoff was great and was so informative regarding the residents of these houses and gave a real insight as to what life was like as the years went on and up until most of these houses were demolished. We are so lucky that together with the national trust, Birmingham preserved these buildings so that they could remain in our history for many years to come. Highly recommend!"
88,So interesting insight,Our guide Charles gave us a fascinating insight into the lives of 3 families who inhabited Court 15 in 3 different decades. We also learned about Birmingham in those decades. It was a really interesting tour and made better by the fact that many references are in living memory. The last inhabitant moved out in 1966! A great afternoon and a very refreshing change from the large country estates we usually visit.
89,Great reminiscing for my father as he lived in a house like these.,Our guide Joy really was great.  Very informative and had personal experience of living in accommodation similar to the back to backs which added to our trip experience.  The sun shining also helped.  A definite must visit in Birmingham.
90,Superb place to go back in time and very realistic,"Although perhaps not the easiest National Trust property to get to, we loved this lengthy tour and special acknowledgement goes to our guide, Carl.  His knowledge and ability to even keep the interest of some younger children on our visit really added to seeing these fascinating houses, well presented in varying periods."
91,Great little place .. National Trust ,I have just been on the tour of the Birmingham Back to Back houses run by the National Trust. It was fainting to have a real insight into the living conditions of working class people in times gone by. The tour guide John brought everything to life and gave the most interesting tour. This is well worth a visit and I highly recommend it.
92,Fascinating,"This collection of restored houses, presented in styles from 1870 to 1930 is one of the best social history lessons one could hope for. It is seen by guided tour only but if our guide Jeff is anything to go by you will revel in the detail, the human stories, and the sheer enthusiasm at work here."
93,A Necessary stop to understand Industrial Birmingham,"My Mom took my sister and I as a treat over the weekend as I study 20th century Britain at university and my sister has always been interested in British history. We had the lovely Jean as our tour guide who was knowledgeable and was obviously very passionate about the Birmingham Back to Backs. She had lots of stories and anecdotes from her own family to tell and they were great to hear as fellow Brummies. It's a great day out and even the rain didn't dampen our day. Highly recommended! Will be back again soon, Jean."
94,History of Birmingham,"This was our first visit to he National Trust Back to Back houses in Birmingham, what a fantastic experience the visual experience, the smells, the history are a remarkable testament to the work put in by the National Trust. This is a Must see venue, all National Trust members appreciate the work put in by the volunteers & this attraction is no exception. However I must make a special mention for our tour guide David (apologies David i didn't get your last name) he was fantastic, a wealth of personal as well as historical information, you were brilliant, thank you."
95,Family outing,"We came across the national trust back to back houses in Birmingham while looking for some where to eat. We joined a tour around and the guide was very informative and the whole tour was very interesting. Definitely a brilliant place to visit, but you need to book the tour but well worth it."
96,Excellent tour,The guide was so knowledgable and brought the back to backs to life. The steep and narrow stairs are not for the faint hearted but well worth the effort.
97,Stepping back in time,Really enjoyed our trip to the Birmingham back to back houses. Thanks to Ross our very knowledgeable guide who made the past come alive.
98,Excellent place to visit,Having lived in Birmingham all my life surprisingly only just visited this historic site. Guess it's true not knowing what is on your own doorstep sometimes! This is a place well worth visiting if you like history and how people used to live....it really gives you an insight in how things used to be. On arrival we were greeted by our tour guide Ann who lived herself in back to back houses....some of her stories were very enlightening. She made the tour really interesting and answered any questions we had with real enthusiasm and a bit of humour! The tour itself lasts approx an hour and a half but it goes so quickly as you seem to travel through time! The houses are small and there are a lot of steep spiral stairs to climb up and down.....but sufficient handles/bannisters to hold onto so no problem if you take it slowly. However probably not suitable for people with severe mobility problems. I loved every part of this experience and would happily visit again as would probably learn something new that I missed this time round! Booking is essential as otherwise you may be disappointed. Would highly recommend a visit .
99,A £9.50 2 hour tour,A really insightful and thought provoking afternoon at this little gem in Birmingham. Not your usual NT stately home with all the grandeur but a stark chilling experience to see how the poor working class residents of Birmingham lived from the late 1800s up until the 1960s.  The visit consists of a private tour (so you have to prebook) delivered by a NT volunteer. I am sure they are all brilliant but if you can insist on Wesley. He is so knowledgeable (he was a previous resident as a child) so he speaks with such passion about life and hardship in this community. He also adds a real spark of humour in his tour so you are smiling and frowning in equal measure.  A great day out for all ages. Just beware there are a couple of steep steps and low ceilings. Well done NT for taking this on and preserving the history
100,A great few hours,"if you are  spending time in Birmingham, the Back to Backs has to be your No1 priority.  An amazing walk back in time with such amazing and interesting guides. We were fortunate to be hosted by Carl (or even Karl - apologies) who was such an informative and amusing host.  Just have to take my sons and grandson!!  Thank you National Trust."
101,Back in time.,"My father went back to his childhood and he thoroughly enjoyed his visit a few years ago it was a ""I remember we had one of,these"", ""mum did this and that"" a great nostalgic trip for him"
102,Back in time,"Highly recommended. Our guide Jean, made history come alive - thank you. Birmingham is so fortunate to still have these Back to Backs."
103,Highly interesting,"Visited a while back but enticed to do a review. Considering my folks first house in the 1960s was a back to back in Small Heath, this brings back real memories. The outside toilet with a pull chain,imagine in winter, the front bay window and door, just the small feel of it.the tin bath, and the yard in front used to be called ""the entry"".industrial workers had it tough in the victorian times, and it was not till 1970s that the back to backs started to vanish as they were regarded slum standard. I think they are rather cosy, but give me a modern house with a garden anyday. Still worth a visit, you will feel very lucky to be living now not then."
104,A good proposal for curious minds,Guide was very knowledgeable. A lot to see how people lived. Very well organised. Nearly 2 hours to see everything.
105,Great day,Wonderful to see these historic houses. A brochure would possibly assist the visitor although tour guides are knowledgeable.
106,Brilliant tour guide,"I was actually born and brought up in one of these houses. Just down the road in Kent Street.Everything about the visit brought  back many memories of my childhood.I can honestly say that everything about the tour is genuine and I remember the tailor mentioned and Harry Cohen who had a guest house in lower Hurst Street where  some of the ""lesser "" acts at the hippodrome would stay.My many visits to the ""Hipp"" as a child gave me my love of theatre which I still have to this day.Doggedd"
107,Much more to this attraction than you would think,"People laughed when we said we were going to Birmingham for our holiday and to see the back to backs (especially a friend in Yorkshire who lives in one!). We can't recommend this tour enough. Jeff our guide was very informative. Many of our group had memories of some of the things on display so it was very interactive. The steep stairs are fine as there are handrails and grab handles. We were allowed to pick things up, sit on the beds etc. Very evocative to consider what life was like for the families who lives here, and so good to see the NT preserving buildings other than stately homes."
108,Bostin place to visit!,"Very interesting tour, highly recommended. Tour guide John was very knowledgeable. Enjoyable afternoon - sweet shop well worth a visit too!"
109,Interesting story,"Visiting The National Trust back to backs is like walking into a time capsule and was a really interesting experience. Our guide Jeff was BRILLIANT, he told us all about it and transported us through the decades by telling us stories about the people who had lived there. Definitely recommend if you like social history"
110,Brilliant!,"We visited the back to backs today after meaning to go for ages. I knew they were somewhere by the Hippodrome but hadn’t noticed them all the times I’d walked past! Anyway we found them and then started in the sweet shop and were met by our guide. I didn’t catch his name unfortunately but he was great, informative, interesting, engaging and funny. 2 hours flew by and the kids who weren’t that keen on going, both enjoyed it. The guide kept them involved which was fun for them. The houses and history are fascinating and this is well worth a visit. Plus the sweet shop is great."
111,Mrs,"A very enjoyable and interesting visit - lots of facts , both educational and humorous. Jeff made it entertaining for all ages and was a great tour guide. Our family ages ranged from 9 to 70 and Jeff Williams did a brilliant job of maintaining our attention the whole time. Thank you"
112,Fantastic,"The National Trust have done a great job with these tiny back to back houses. None of your stately homes, 4 poster beds, manicured laws or servants quarters here. These are as they were going back almost 200 years. We were expertly escorted by one of the very knowledgeable and enthusiastic guides and as we trooped up and down stairs we all became totally immersed in the history and, more to the point, the lives of the individual people who lived in the different rooms. Like many 'working class' dwellings, they were immaculate and loved by those who lived in them but they were tiny, cramped and had no hint of comfort at all. And to top them off, China town is right next door so we had to sacrifice our much anticipated National Trust soup in exchange for some of Birmingham's best Dim. What a grand day out.Sum"
113,Absolutely fab and informative!,"Had a great time at Birmingham Back to Backs with friends.Booking was easy - emailed when we were free and got a confirmation by telephone (voicemail, because I missed it!). Signed in on the day to get our tickets and pay/show our membership cards and then got some sweets from the shop next door before our tour. The sweet shop was great, big selection of old favourites sold by the quart.We met our tour guide, Des, outside the shop. He was wonderful - friendly and chatty - full of facts. He really tailored the tour to our group and where our questions led.You are taken through several of the houses, with stories in each room and clambering up and down steep steps. You're allowed to touch a lot of the objects in the rooms and sit on chairs and beds which really gives it a homely and relaxed feel. You can also hear the movement and mumbles from other tours, which adds to the atmosphere, as that's how it would have been in the past! People telling from Windows down to the court below.This was a highlight of our weekend in the city, with a really great insight into the highs and lows of life for ordinary people in the past."
114,"Fascinating tour, excellent tour guide",Fascinating insight into the lives and living conditions endured by city residents. These were truly hard times.
115,Finding my heritage in Birmingham,This was my second visit to the wonderful Back to Backs - this time bringing my husband.  Our tour guide Jean was so knowledgable and kept the tour interesting and relevant with stories. This is the National Trust at it's best.  Excellently restored and decorated to show a progression in history of how people managed.  So important to how we are today and relevant to everyone.  If you have not been I highly recommend this.
116,Fascinating and informative visit,"So close to New St Station and yet a world away, this bookable treat is fantastic. Our guide, Jane, was charismatic, knowledgeable and fun, bringing the lives of the residents to life. She was as much a star as the properties. Access for taller or less mobile visitors is a bit of a challenge - steep stairways and low ceilings, but traversing two hundred years of progress and regression is fascinating and rewarding.This National Trust property is vividly rendered and is the perfect remedy for 2020 Tory Britain."
117,Back to reality,"Superb  couple of hours going back in time with our very enthusiastic guide John, a  volunteer with the National Trust who own the Back to Back properties.The tour needs to be booked in advance via the website.There were 8 of us in our group, we were taken through 3 back to back houses that had been redecorated to look as if they were from the 1840’s, 1870’s and 1930’s.It gave you a real insight into the life of the poor working class of the time.For anyone interested in local history this is a must do.There are several flights of very narrow steep stairs to negotiate but if you have mobility problems then a ground floor tour can be organised if you let them know in advance."
118,Perfect for historians and tourists alike!,"A real insight into an important part of Birmingham's social history. Well-presented and informative. Our guide, John, was hugely knowledgeable and led the group brilliantly. A great afternoon out."
119,Freinds birthday,"Birmingham back to backs were a national trust destination we had been planning to go to for a while. What out us off was that you have to book in advance.  Do not let this out you off. The tour lasts around 90 minutes and covers the history of the last back to back houses in the country. There is a fascinating history starting around 1840 and working to the 2000’s that is well presented in a true time travel experience. Coupled with knowledgeable tour guides to explain the stories and point out key exhibits, the time flew by. We will definitely be making a return visit to one of the smallest but interesting National Trust places we have been to. Sadly, you are not allowed to take photos on the tour."
120,Afternoon visits ,"We visited 7th Sept for treat for hubbys birthday. Our guide, Jeff was fantastic. Involved the kids on the tour and was very informative. Was great to hear the stories and see some of the stuff that my dad and grandad did/used back in the day. Would highly recommend."
121,An excellent tour,Saw this tour when searching for things to do on our trip to Birmingham. Sooo glad I booked it .Love social history and often visit Beamish museum in County Durham .we went round in small groups at regular intervals.Our guide told us interesting stories about who used to live there as well as sharing his own memories of living in a back to back .Yes a few steep spiral wooden stairs to go up and down so not good if you're not physically fit .We were warned the houses didn't smell great but I actually love those old smells .We kept close to the fires as a wee bit nippy when visiting in the winter .Highly recommend
122,Lovely NT tour,The guided tour was excellent and the National Trust volunteer certainly brought the 4 houses back to life with his knowledge. These houses are gems surrounded by modern buildings part of the regeneration of a Birmingham. A must to visit as is the old fashioned sweet shop on the corner also owned by the National Trust.
123,Nostalgic,"Wanted to go here for  ages finally went on my birthday Had a fab time even in the pouring rain, as usual the volunteers were amazing and explained everything really well there are 4 houses and also the court yard"
124,Great day out!,A remarkable piece of conservation which gives you a great insight into the life of Victorian working class Birmingham.
125,Entertaining & thought provoking,"We hear it has good reviews and what this little outing packs is a big punch. Informative, funny, sad, nostalgic all at once. To think some council might have knocked this piece of history down. The national trust has done an amazing job. If you live in the Midlands or need a Birmingham activity 15 minutes from the Bull ring visit here. It's a timed guided tour with plenty of time at the end on your own. Note not all lavatorys are for the public so Jeff or Geoff says. Very good visit not suitable to little children I would say."
126,Wonderful visit ,"My husband grew up in a Back to back house in Birmingham. Visiting the Birmingham Back to Backs took him back to his childhood reviving mixed memories. The restoration/conservation that has been carried out is remarkable and whilst II grew up in a very different environment there were many sights and smells that reminded me of my own childhood.Our guide, Jeff was extremely knowledgeable and talked with humour and respect about life in areas of Birmingham over 150 years ago right through to the 1970s.This is a small NT property but absolutely worth visiting. Jeff talked about real families who lived in these properties bringing their histories to life and reminding us of a bygone age. We thoroughly enjoyed the hour and a half tour and would highly recommend a visit. (Booking required)"
127,A real gem - don't miss it,on my first visit to Birmingham I found this tour of part of the social history of the city fascinating. The tour guide was extremely knowkledgable and made the whole experience a real pleasure. I would highly recommend
128,Back to Back Houses,"Absolutely brilliant visit! Our guide, Jean , made it particularly interesting sharing anecdotal stories from her own grandmother who spent her childhood in a Back to Back housing. If you're available Birmingham, it's definitely worth going."
129,A must see for all Brummies,"If ever you're around the Birmingham area, this place is well worth a visit. A really fascinating and informative tour around 3 generations of Birmingham life. The renovation work done is remarkable when you look at the state it was in, and just one of those treasures well worth keeping. Thanks to our guide for turning a very wet soggy afternoon in Birmingham into a very interesting, memorable one!"
130,Our 1st visit today,"As a National Trust venue, this city centre attraction is “bostin“, pure Brummy nostalgia led around by guide Jeff, a superb local with a fantastic insight into the past.It makes you realise how tough it was for those living there all those years ago."
131,Birmingham Back to Backs tour,"A fascinating step back into social history Excellent guide, wonderful experience One of the best NT things I’ve ever done. Wonderful"
132,Excellent tour,"Fascinating trip back in time, and a comprehensive overview given by our friendly guide Jeff. You start the tour off in 1870s and then move forward through time through another 2 properties to reach the 1930's. You then step through another of the many ""secret doors"" into the final property, a tailors shop. Our children loved the twisty route around the properties and really enjoyed the way that the experiences of the past residents were brought back to life through the descriptions and items around the houses. Well worth the visit, a ground floor tour is available to those that can't manage the stairs. Book well in advance so as to avoid disappointment!"
133,"Brilliant tour, fabulous tour guide","Paid a visit to the Back to Backs this afternoon and had a very enjoyable time, our tour guide was Wesley his knowledge of the properties was 2nd to none and his insights having lived in similar properties himself was excellent. Certainly very different from ‘normal’ NT properties and not one if you have mobility problems because of all the stairs other than that would thoroughly recommend an excellent way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon."
134,Brilliant!!,A very interesting tour. The social history was fascinating. Our tour guide gave a lot of back ground information
135,A great way to bring history to life!,"Visited with family, you have to pre book to do the tour as it’s always busy.  The visitors centre is part of the building, you can go up stairs to view some of the items such as wallpaper and old newspapers which is good for helping the kids occupied until the tour begins. You start from the sweet shop, I would recommend popping in the shop it’s lovely. Lots of old sweets. The tour guide was informative and provided a lot of information about the area and the houses. It was a great experience, the stairs are steep, the rooms were good and it was great that you could sit on the bed and chairs. You can walk around the court yard, visit the old toilets and the old wash house. There’s a weatherspoons across the road, great stop off for lunch, overall a great experience."
136,Excellant tour,"Thank you to our knowlgeable tour guide Jeff. Really interesting to time travel through the ages, and see how our ancestors used to live. If you go you must also visit the exhibition in the gift shop. Photos of the people who lived there really bring it to life. Well worth a visit"
137,Birmingham back to backs,"We had Jeff as our tour guide and he was incredible. Very friendly and really knowledgeable; his mother used to live in a back to back house, so he could answer almost any question. This national trust property is a guided tour where you can touch any ornament and sit on any furniture. Easily the best national trust attraction my family and I have been to."
138,Interesting insight into a world lost in time...,"Have been wanting to come here for ages, well worth a visit for any one interested in our social history, Pat our tour guide was very knowledgeable & passionate about the subject, can highly recommend this tour"
139,"Fascinating, but book before you go!",Me and my fiancé had a great time at the Birmingham back to backs. Our guide Ross was very knowledgable and friendly. We would recommend it to anyone.
140,A lovely slice of history in downtown Birmingham,"Stunning for such a little company, true passion and an education journey of brum used to like and perhaps should still be!"
141,Fantastic way to spend a couple of hours,The other reviews have said it all really. If you have any interest in history you have to visit .What also really added to the day was our outstanding guide Jessica. She really brought everything to life and the 90 minutes flew by as we were well and truly captivated by what we saw and heard.Booking is recommended even though some drop ins were accommodated.
142,Interesting and informative,"First point. If you would like a guided tour of these sympathetically restored Victorian Back to Back houses, now in the care of the National Trust, you have to book ahead. Once on the tour it is obvious why and second point to note, the houses are small and have very steep stairs. Our guide was John. He did an excellent job of recreating what life would’ve been like at various points in time, how the occupants spent their day, how they earned their money and just how hard life was. He was also brilliant at getting all of us engaged and involved. The hour and a half tour speed by. And afterwards you can visit an old fashioned sweet shop."
143,A great way to spend a Sunday afternoon,I visited with a friend as my Grandad used to live in a Birmingham back-to-back and wasn't expecting much. I was entirely surprised by how informative and interesting the tour was. The volunteer who showed our small group of 8 around the back-to-backs knew everything there was to know about the history and was also very enthusiastic to share this with us. The tour lastest around an hour and a half and was worth every moment. Would definitely reccommend for those in Birmingham wanting to find out more about the history of the area.
144,Back to Backs,"14 of us spent a very rainy afternoon at this National Trust attraction.  There are two tours, one for upstairs and downstairs and one for the less mobile of just the downstairs only.We did the whole tour with the fabulous guide Ross who was very knowledgeable and interactive with the group.  The tour took just over 1 and half hours and it was good value.  We were not rushed at all and learned so much about this form of social housing.I recommend this tour for anyone interested in industrial or social history."
145,Fascinating Tour,We really enjoyed our day here. It’s the best national trust we have visited as far as the information they give you about living in a back to back property back then. Would highly recommend.
146,Candlelit Tour,Visited at the weekend (you must book) and got taken round by John who was extremely knowledgeable and humorous. He explained what the back to backs are and what life was life for the families that lived in them.  You must visit if you are interested in history and how we survived in the hard times.
147,Journey back in time,"Ross our tour guide was excellent reliving the history for us and making us laugh , this is really a fantastic tour well worth a visit."
148,A step back in time,"Big thanks to Jeff- what an interesting, entertaining tour we have just had Learned so much alongside some fab peopleThoroughly recommend this visit x"
149,Fantastic guided tour.,"We spent a lovely couple of hours on a guided tour. Our guide explained life in the area in different periods and we were able to see and experience these small, and often cramped houses that were such a big part of Birmingham and other parts of the UK. Many of the items on display brought back childhood memories and many anecdotes were shared by the guide and other members of the group. Thoroughly recommend it."
150,Fantastic tour,We've just been to this attraction and it was an afternoon well spent. We loved the old time sweet shop and we stocked up on our favourites.What really did it for me was the guide Jeff he brought to life what life was like for the people who lived in the houses and how lucky we are today
151,Excellent tour!,"We had Jean Shepherd as our tour guide, she had a personal family link to the back to backs, so our tour had family tales interwoven with the known history of the place. The tour is about 90 minutes and flies by! You see a great selection of rooms upstairs and downstairs, physically and metaphorically, as you hear about people in deepest poverty through to someone who lives in a much more comfortable setting, from 1830 to 1966, in various family sizes and ages. It was so so so interesting, we're still talking about it now."
152,Brilliant,We thoroughly enjoyed this guided tour with John who was knowledgeable and amusing.These preserved and restored back to backs give a fascinating insight into social conditions in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. If you have an interest in social history it’s well worth a visit
153,Worth a trip !,"An amazing museum, learned so much from this, have done this twice and will be doing this museum again when we return."
154,Wonderful Journey back in time,"Had family with teenage children visiting from USA, all of them and LOVED this place, we were invited to join in and they were quite impressed by our knowledge, (I had worked in a certain bank and husband is a historian!!!) Staff all friendly and helpful, and our niece Harriet loved being the workhorse! 😂 😂"
155,Fantastic Tour Guides Jeff & Alison,This is a real gem!  Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and had been brought up in a back to back himself so was really able to bring the tour to life.  Loads of memories for me of things I had seen in my grandparents house.  Well worth a visit!
156,old days,"I visited here with a school I work with and i was very suprised where it was! I've been to hurst street many times and never noticed this place. It was such a pleasant suprise when we went inside, there are so many fascinating things to see and learn about.  The guides are very friendly and they lead us around well. Overall we had a lovely visit and I will be recommending to others."
157,A must see,"This is a real worthwhile visit in Central Birmingham, Our guide Carl really made history come to life as he walked us through and up and down (quite a few narrow, twisty staircases but they do offer a ground floors only tour for those less agile) four properties from 1840, 1870, 1930 and a tailor shop (looked like it did the day after it was closed). Fascinating to see products and articles that you had seen in your grandparents' houses. Also you get a view of toilets through the ages !! A real reminder of how much we take for granted - fetching 20 buckets of water from a nearby well, anyone ? . Booking is essential and visit is by guided tour only but if you get Carl guiding you, you will have a very enjoyable visit. There is a small exhibition, souvenir shop and best of all, an old-fashioned sweet shop"
158,Fantastic,I visited with my adult son and daughter. We all really enjoyed the tour. It was helpful to have a guide to point out things to you. Would recommend. It’s fascinating to see the conditions that people lived in not all that long ago.
159,Fantastic Tour of Birmingham Back to Backs,"I visited the back to backs one rainy morning recently (a long overdue visit) and what an interesting visit it was.Our guide Val Paige was very knowledgeable and happy to answer the groups questions, it was really interesting to hear about the families who occupied these cottages and appreciate their difficulties...it's a thorough recommend!"
160,Lots of interesting history!,Took my two children (15 & 6) and their grandparents. Our tour guide Geoff (with a G!) was fantastic!! Kept all age groups engaged with his extensive knowledge of the back to backs and the some of the people who once lived there. The sweet shop was a great treat aswell!!
161,NT Back to backs Holiday Cottages,"Our guide was Carl a self confessed yam yam and he was terrific   taking us on a tour through the houses from early 19th c to as late as 1974 . He pointed out the changes at each stage even the loos on the yard progressed from a plank on a bucket to a flush toilet .Fascinating and absorbing for all ages and taking about 90 mins , too small for a restaurant on site but there is a Wetherspoons on Hurst Street and the coffee is cheaper there!There are several flights of very steep and slightly tricky stairs so if you are not so good on your pins maybe give it a miss."
162,Excellent tour ,"We had been meaning to visit these houses for years and today was a perfect opportunity prior to visiting the Hippodrome later.What a wonderful trip back in time brought back to life by our extremely knowledgable guide, Jeff. So much to take in - the squalid conditions our ancestors had to endure and the gradual improvements over the decades. Many of the exhibits brought a smile to my face as I recalled seeing them as a youngster and in some cases - still owned in boxes in the garage!!"
163,Fascinating glimpse into 200 years of life in Birmingham,"The back to backs in Birmingham city centre are a great little gem of the National Trust, you could walk past them and miss them, if you do you will miss a treat. Go through the door a step back in time, the place smells of Victorian England, you think houses today are small!You can self guide or go round with an NT guide , which is included in the entrance fee.Fascinating insight to how life was for the poorest in society. In 1875, the Government sought to outlaw them due to their awful unsanitary conditions, but didn’t enforce the demolition and councils and land owners were free to ignore the law, even to the point of building more.Well worth a visit."
164,Birmingham Back to Backs,What a Wonderful experience to go back in time in History. The tour guide Chris was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable I didnt want it to end. I would highly recommend this day out to all....well done National Trust for renovating this place.
165,Stepping back in time,Spent a fascinating couple of hours at the Back to Backs with our tour guide Jeff. Quite a humbling experience to see how Brummies lived not that long ago. Thank you National Trust for keeping them for prosperity.If you are visiting Birmingham book a tour!
166,Back to Backs,"Our tour around the Back to Backs in Birmingham was utterly fascinating. Our guide Ross was excellent and skillfully mixed the historical facts of the buildings with a sense of great humour. Through his skill we felt that we really knew the stories of the families who resided or worked there. The houses and outhouses had been carefully restored with visual appeal, and it was thrilling to experience both a number of surprises at the conditions involved for the past inhabitants, tempered by memories of so many items and descriptions which rang a bell from our own history. A fascinating afternoon."
167,A visit to ordinary life in the past,"We really enjoyed our visit today. Our guide Dave was informative and told the history of the back to backs in an interesting way. Great that he’d experienced living in a similar way himself as it added to the experience. A hidden gem in the heart of Birmingham, definitely worth a visit."
168,Travelling back in time.,"I didn't know what to expect and I ended up learning a lot about Birmingham's history from the 1800s up until the 1960s. What I learned put a lot of things about today's England into perspective. The tour guide John was so friendly and informative, and our group had a great time. Highly recommended!"
169,An interesting informative visit,"Absolutely love this place,  you have to pre book to get your slot, then you get a guided tour around the houses, loved every minute of this place, go visit"
170,"Lovely place, great and informative tour",It was okay not the best off all places off the national trust if from the old generation then you would probably enjoy it better loved the sweet shop best part off it lol
171,Great day!,"Just finished a two hour tour of the back to backs with Ross who was brilliant. He gave so much interesting detail about the history, the people who lived there and about the local area. An excellent few hours which totally flew by. Thanks!"
172,Lovely day out,"Having visited many national trust houses,this I can say was the most interesting,our guide Chris was so informative.If you like history then this is the one to book."
173,Outstanding guided tour experience ,"As a National Trust member, I’m not a great history buff as the ‘king, queen, battle’ stuff doesn’t really do it for me.  However, tell me a story of ordinary people like me and you, and what their lives were, and I’m hooked.  This was that kind of visit.Our guide was Jeff Williams and he was fantastic - clearly knew a lot and loved his subject.  The place is unlike a lot of National Trust properties in that you are encouraged to touch almost everything including trying out the chairs and the beds and the stories of the people who lived in the houses is brought to life beautifully.You can only visit if you book a tour and I can understand why as without the guide (ask for Jeff, with a J) it would’ve been a lesser experience.  Having said that, the small exhibition, with the recorded stories of the people of the day, is also worth visiting at the beginning or the end.  Overall, don’t question whether it’s worth going - it is!"
174,More than expected,"Brilliant setting,  lovely staff and volunteers,  we really enjoyed ourselves - nice to something a bit different. Really well located to pubs and restaurants closeby. Fantastic all in all."
175,Birmingham ,Visiting Birmingham with a friend and decided to visit based on reviews.  Not disappointed at all.  A great tour with a very interesting host.  Good way to learn about Birmingham history.
176,Excellent Venue,Steve provided us with an excellent tour of the back to back houses. This was an informative and interesting insight into Birmingham's social history!
177,History at its most real,"Just got home from our first ever visit to the back to backs, it was a birthday present from my family for my 65th birthday. We had a brilliant tour guide called Neil and he even dressed for the occasion, he was so informative about every house we went into, very funny, very caring and also very sensitive when he told us about some of the sad times these people had gone through, he made it so interesting throughout the whole tour and didn't make it stuffy like some of the national trust tour guides where you are frightened to speak, I have wanted to visit for years and was not disappointed Only thing I'm gutted about we went into the gift and sweet shop afterwards and forgot to take some photos in the courtyard and wanted them for memories of my birthday, well done Neil you do a great job"
178,Excellent museum,"What a fantastic place to visit. Jeff our guide was full of knowledge and enthusiasm and an asset to the National Trust. The properties have been loving restored and the period furniture is brilliant in setting the scene and atmosphere. I am Birming ham born and bred and of an age where I could relate to some of the day to day aspects like the range, outside privy, tin bath and sharing a bed. Would highly recommend to everyone as it is a step back in time where Jeff let us into another world. Better than I had expected, well done."
179,Well worth a visit,"The Back to Back tour was fantastic. Joyce the guide was informative, interesting and funny the way she told people off 😂😂 Definitely worth seeing if you come to Birmingham."
180,Wonderful Tour of Historic Houses of Birmingham,My friends treated me to this and lunch after it was a lovely day remembering how we used to live but not wanting to live like it again very narrow stairs but a wonderful day
181,What a great day,Took my nan and she LOVED IT. Take your older generation to it! A blast in the past that they'll love 😍
182,Very Interesting Visit,"Was persuaded by my wife to stay for 2 nights in one of the back to backs as her birthday treat. Thoroughly enjoyed it but would say be prepared for very steep and narrow stairs. Cleverly designed hidden modern en suite  allows the experience not to be basic. Very noisy outside but you are in a very busy theatre, club and restaurant area. We certainly recommend both staying there and the accompanied tour."
183,A true hidden gem,"The Back to Backs appeal to all the senses- the smell of coal fires and carbolic soap, the sense of being enclosed and in a stuffy airless house. The artefacts from the past bring to life everyday life over a 150 year period. Often historical sites are about wealthy people’s lives with grand houses but this is a glimpse into how the majority of working people in the age of the industrial revolution."
184,Stepping back in time,"Absolutely fantastic- superb insight into the way we used to live. The whole experience was brought to life by our excellent tour guide,Pat. You have to pre-book this National Trust property for a tour of the back to backs and  don't miss the sweet shop. Allow 2 hours for the tour, which is suitable for all ages, but be aware there are winding staircases. There is a downstairs only tour available. It's about a 10 minute walk from Birmingham Grand Central train station next to the Hippodrome Theatre. Lots of places to eat and drink either before or after your tour. Excellent and a big thank you to Pat."
185,Loved it,"We visited the Back to Backs when the National Trust first opened them (in 2004?!)  Back then they were finding their feet and there was fine-tuning to do but it was still very interesting.  So, fast forward to August 2019…our friend was over from Norway for her holiday and expressed a wish to visit this historical attraction.I contacted them by email barely five days ahead of our planned visit at 11am (the advice is to allow at least that long) but had our confirmation back very quickly.  We joined the 10:45 Sunday tour with Anne as our guide.  We were a decent sized group of around ten people, which made it cozy in some rooms!To break the ice Anne went around the group: we each gave our name and where we were from.  We were also warned again that the tour would include climbing and descending eight sets of narrow and steep stairs.  They are not exaggerating about this.  If you are well-built, tall or are at all unsteady on your feet, you need to think carefully about taking the full tour.  One gentleman in our group was well over 6ft tall and had to be VERY careful of low ceilings and beams!Anne made the tour very interesting, engaging and entertaining.  She delivered her knowledge almost unerringly and with obvious enthusiasm.  She worked various members of our group into the tour, matching us with key family members from the history of the property.  This helped us relate to the people and their history, but also added to the fun...as did various questions asked of us to challenge our knowledge or powers of deduction.  This was not a dry room by room lecture.  Anne brought it all very much to life.The time seemed to go by all too quickly.  That said, I never even bothered to check for the time.  The tour took at least 1½hrs but didn’t seem that long.  Everyone was fully engaged, learning something new and interesting as we travelled from the 1830s up to 2001 when the last occupant vacated the property.  Very enjoyable and a reminder of how lucky we are to hold on to such a vulnerable slice of our history and heritage...and how lucky many of us we are to grow up and live as we now do.So, compared with our first visit has much changed?  Not really, but I think the main difference may be a combination of the available knowledge & artifacts being greater and how it’s delivered is much improved.  I highly recommend this experience.  My friend from Norway loved it.There are a few public car parks not far away (although we both used public transport on this occasion) and plenty to see nearby since you are close to the city centre, which also means ample eateries to choose from, including all the Chinese Quarter and theatre area have to offer locally.  As part of a full day out, this attraction is well worth inclusion."
186,Fascinating,"I was actually born in a back to back house in Woodcock Street, Aston. So for me this was chance to look at my past. I was 5 when we left so I only had vague memories of my birth place. It's a very interesting part of Birmingham's history and I would highly recommend a visit."
187,What an insight,Thank you Anne our guide and all the team for a wonderful tour - what an amazing insight into yesteryear.My wife Jill and I learnt so much from this experience.Don't miss out - book it!
188,Best tour!,"This was a fantastic day out. We were shown around by a brilliant guide I think Dorothy was her name a volunteer but new very interesting information about the house, what they were like and what life was like in Victorian Birmingham. Really great to look around. Lovely sweet shop the old till is quite a site and the people in reception were good as well. All was great."
189,Truely Fantastic,"Although I’ve been here before, this was made one of the best because of our guide called Kay, who was humorous, but very informative. She told us things I hadn’t heard before, so it was as though I’d never been before. 10 out of 10 for this experience.Thank you."
190,Very informative and enjoyable visit.,I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the history of people in Britain. These brilliantly restored houses give you an insight to how Birmingham changed during the Industrial Revolution and the impact on the lives who lived through it. A simply excellent attraction.
191,Very informative tour,"I visited today with my parents (I’m slightly older than a teenager!). Our tour guide was David Swain. His knowledge and sense of humour made the experience unforgettable! The walk through time, showcasing the various decades of this tiny area of Birmingham and the various families who lived there was fabulous! A must, must, must see!"
192,Bit of economic history!,Being a member of the national trust this is a must see attraction if you want to relive the past. So much to see in a small area but nevertheless rewarding
193,Back in time,We enjoyed a thoroughly worthwhile informative and enjoyable tour through this cluster of back-to-back houses in inner city Birmingham maintained by the National Trust. Many thanks to John who really brought the lives of the generations of families who lived and worked here to life. Strongly recommended!
194,Really interesting but booking got mixed up,We visited today in the pouring rain and had a truly memorable time in this great place.Jeff our guide took us through the 19th to the 20th century with great knowledge and humour and introduced us to the remarkable people who lived in these houses.Thank goodness to the National Trust and Birmingham City Council for preserving this part of our history.  We would encourage everyone to visit the back to backs in Birmingham.
195,"Fantastic tour, filled with social history",What an NT gem this is. Entry is by timed ticket and it is essential book beforehand.Our excellent guide Eric was a mine of information and was enthusiastic and humorous when relating the stories of the families living in the houses and the conditions they endured. A definite “must see”
196,Outstanding,"Tour guide John showed us round the Back to Backs today. What a fantastic experience it was. Rather than walking around a museum and reading placards which can be exhausting, or audio guides which can be anti social, having a tour guide means you learn so much more and can share your own experiences. John had lots of interesting stories to tell about the houses and about Birmingham. I learnt so much more than I thought I would and the 90 minutes flew by."
197,Fascinating tour,"Visited with my wife and 6 year old Grandson. Anne was our guide for the tour, she was excellent and having herself grown up in the back to backs, she was able to give us a true personal insight on life in the houses. Our Grandson loved his visit."
198,Great experience Jeff was BRILLIANT ,"Having lived in a Birmingham Back to Back house up to the age of 8, this brought back so many memories of how we used to live. What really brought it all to life was the knowledge, experience and story telling of our fantastic guide Dave. The stories he told of his own life resonated greatly with me, but also informed and educated all the other people in our tour group both young and old. Well worth the money, if you live in Brum or are just visiting don`t miss this great attraction !! Will def be back."
199,Great journey back in time.,"Fantastic! Deserves it number one place. Great project but our tour was made extra special by Les - delightful guide informative, authentic and entertaining - thanks Les you’re FAB"
200,A window into the past,Overlooked leaving a review when I went but it lingers in my memory - very interesting afternoon out
201,Return to a life in a bygone era,"Had heard about the 'back to backs' for years but never been and didn't really know where they were, despite being a Hippodrome regular!Anyway, finally made a visit here and really glad I did. The court itself is a lovely little place, tucked away being the shop, and you can instantly imagine what it would look and feel like with kids and families sharing it back in the day. The tour through the houses was really interesting, seeing recreations of how they would have been set up and hearing about  real life stories and families.  The guides are both knowledgeable and passionate about the site. Really is worth a visit if you can"
202,Wonderful time capsule,"We spent a fantastic afternoon travelling through the history of these houses, with our superb guide Jeff. His enthusiasm and knowledge really brought the families and tenants who live through the timeline of these houses to life.  This should be a must see for every National Trust member as it really highlights the great job the trust and volunteers do."
203,Hidden Gem,"Three generations of our family visited the Back to Backs this Saturday,  and it was better than any of us had imagined. This was helped greatly by our tour guide Dave Durose, whose humour and personal experiences from the start of the renovation of the scheme, and home life as a child growing up in a back to back, really brought the place to life. I can't recommend this to you highly enough,"
204,Back to backs amazing,The Birmingham back to backs provide a window into the lives of working class people during England's industrial revolution - and is quite different from the grand houses managed by the NT. If you are interested in social history it is well worth taking the tour. Our guide ( Jeff with a J !) was really informative and made sure we got the most out of the visit.
205,steeped in history,Excellent visit. Our guide Carl was brilliant. An amazing step back in time. Well worth a visit. Thank you National Trust.
206,Fascinating history ,"Fantastic visit made very special by our guide Jeff Williams. He was able through his knowledge and wit take us back in time to really understand what it was to like to live in this era .A real gem  of  a place detailing the history of living in our city. Well done National  Trust for  investing,  can’t recommend a visit enough .... you won’t be disappointed .Shout out to lovely lady in the shop too ...great afternoon all round !"
207,Lots of memories!,"This property is such a unique gem in a world where developers will knock down anything for a profit, and deserves every one of the 5* reviews!A ‘time capsule’ perfectly preserved, with a rich and interesting history vividly brought alive by Jeff (with a J), whose passion for the property and area, extensive knowledge and sense of humour won the hearts of all our group.I too work as a professional tour guide and was blown away by Jeff. The man is an absolute legend who clearly revels in showing off this marvellous place!"
208,Fabulous afternoon out!,"This tour is superb. Made even more special by Ross. He was a great guide. So knowledgeable and had lots of living history stories to tell. The four of us found the tour so informative and interesting. It’s not suitable for people with mobility problems. The stairs have twists in them and are exceptionally steep. However there are lots of antique chairs which visitors are allowed to sit on. We came away feeling privileged that we no longer have to live in such poor and cramped conditions. It was a humbling experience. Well done to the NT for renovating these old buildings, which are now safe and suitable for visitors."
209,A trip into the past,"I visited The Birmingham Back to Backs on a hot sunny afternoon in the summer holidays, with my 13 and 18 year old daughters. Our tour guide Jeff was brilliant, he was full of knowledge and got everyone involved. He had a very easy going attitude and made the tour very enjoyable and interesting. The rooms are small but group sizes are kept small too. There are low ceilings (but you get plenty of warnings) and narrow winding staircases but these aren’t a problem as long as you’re not planning on wearing your stilettos. The tour lasts about an hour and a half and you can buy some sweets from the vintage sweet shop afterwards. We all had a good time and I would recommend a visit."
210,Missed opportunity to see this place,"Enjoyed the visit so much.John was a brilliant guide bringing lots of humour and interest to the very informative tour.So many things to see, bought back a few memories of grand parents house.It's great that these houses have been preserved in such a great way to help us understand the history of the area.Thoroughly enjoyed. The tour takes approx 1 and half hours and the sweet shop is well worth a visit to finish the day."
211,Jeff or Geoff was fab,For those interested in Birmingham’s social history this is well worth the visit. Carl did a great job explaining how housing changed over the past 200 years. Well worth the 90 minute guided tour.
212,Something different in Birmingham,We were given the opportunity to visit as a present for Christmas. Perhaps one of the best presents we had. My farther and his sister used to live in back to Backs in Winson Green and Granville St and I remember going to see them in the early 60s.What a lot of memories this visit bought back. The narrow stars the tiny kitchen and not to mention the small rooms and low ceilings. The guide was excellent and very informative making the hour and twenty minutes of the tour magic.I would recommend to anyone wanting to see how Victoria life was lived by the common people.
213,Great tour Jeff,"Such fascinating tour, takes 90 minutes, we booked by email on the morning and we were accommodated. Very knowledgeable guides with good humour and patience. Some steep staircases to navigate. My teenage son loved it despite initial lure of the bull ring shops. Very centrally located. Yet again I'm so grateful the NT exists to save these gems."
214,Fantastic tour guide,"This is one of the best national trust sites we have ever visited. The guided tour is marvellous, as the guides are so knowledgeable and willing to explain things in great detail."
215,Excellent vist,Chris our tour guide was a lovely informative lady. She was very knowledgeable with lots of stories about the families that once lived there. She took her time to answer any questions the group had. It was a very interesting tour. Would highly recommend to others.
216,Interesting tour,This trip is made by the guides. I've seen lots of recommendations for guides so I guess they are all amazing. We had Ross and he was brilliant at bringing history to life and talking to kids and adults. There were 2 adults and 5 children in our party and we had a tour to ourselves which was brilliant. I would definitely recommend this. The stairs are steep. The children and adults need to be able to concentrate and listen for over an hour to get the best from this experience. I would definitely recommend it.
217,Absolutely brilliant,Our tour guide John was informative and funny! Most of our group were from Birmingham too and it was great to hear some of their memories or stories from the past.
218,History home,"Our tour guide, Jeff, was outstanding. He really brought these fascinating little houses to life with his vivid descriptions of the hard lives of the previous inhabitants. He was also a good listener, and interacted well with members of the tour group as we reminisced about the past in response to the things we saw and the stories he told us!  The National Trust has presented each of the houses in a different period, and Jeff described the living conditions of real families who are known to have lived in the houses. The final part of the tour was a visit to the tailor’s shop, which was the last of the shops there to close, in 2000. It seems amazing, in a city the size of Birmingham that once had so many such houses, that this small court is the last surviving. A really worthwhile tour, highly recommend."
219,Excellent and fun,"This is the way our heritage should be presented, a one and a half hour tour that held your interest from start to finish. A great experience"
220,Highly recommend.,"Visited with Australian granddaughter ,cannot recommend this enough .NT staff were so helpful from the initial booking stage and throughout our afternoon visit .Ross (our guide ) was friendly and welcoming, His knowledge of his subject was faultless and he had the children spellbound and at times amazed about life in the back to backs.Anyone considering a visit don’t hesitate ..we would even consider another visit ! Thank you Ross you made the day for us ! X"
221,Fantastic visit. Totally recommend,"The NT have done an amazing job restoring this building for everyone to discover. Jeff was our volunteer guide, who told us facts and funny stories and brought the place to life. Make sure you book ahead as space is limited. Suitable for children 7+"
222,Absolutely fascinating!,"Ross was an excellent guide, full of interesting information and humour. This was our first visit and gave such insight into past lives in Brum."
223,Brought back memories,"We arrived to the Back to Back museum with a wonderfully warm welcome and then we were greeted by our tour guide Geoff who captivated our attention for two hours.  The museum has been brilliantly restored and set across three different time periods, Geoff was one of the most knowledgable guides we have expereinced he was funny and informative creative vivid images of what life would have been like living in the Back to Back houses.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in history and for any family who would like their children to see how hard life used to be!"
224,Brilliant Brilliant,"Long story short - this is the best National Trust experience there is! Personal small groups, lots of chances to ask questions. You get a real feel for the slums that our ancestors once lived in. Oh and the sweet shop is first class !!"
225,great for a group tour,"Finally got around to booking (essential) in for the tour and was not disappointed, the rooms are so small that only a few people can be accommodated on each tour!Our guide was well informed and gave a very humourous guided tourDuring the 90 minute tour there are lots of narrow doorways and steep stairs, both up and down, to negotiate so you do need to be able bodiedYou are introduced to the ever changing history of the properties and its occupants with fascinating description of their lives and businessesThere are lots of objects to see and handle to help you get a fuller picture of life in the back to back housing of the timesThere is a small museum to view and a visit to the sweet shop on the corner is an absolute mustPlease make sure to book so as not to be dissapointed when you are turned away, as all tours are fully booked, if you turn up on spec!"
226,Well worth a visit for all generations of the family,Really enjoyed our guided tour yesterday. Tour guide John had some very interesting fact and funny stories to tell. I've lived in Birmingham all my life and only recently spotted the National Trust houses. You have to book and it did take me several phone calls to get through to make the booking but I'm glad I persevered! Thank you John for a very enjoyable 1 and a half hour tour
227,Fascinating and poignant experience,"This NT property is definitely worth a visit if you are in Birmingham. I went today with a friend and we both walked out amazed at how interesting it was. Our guide, Jane, was engaging, informative and very funny. We had a wonderful afternoon and learnt a lot about life in the Back to Backs. Thank you!"
228,Excellent!,We visited the Back to back attraction as a family of 4 (2 adults with 2 kids under 8) and we really enjoyed it. We were guided by David Harris who was simply wonderful. He really set the scene of what life was like over the 150 years period that these houses spanned.  He used lots of old Brummie phrases which made my wife and I smile as we both have parents and grandparents from Birmingham. He was able to keep all of the group interested in what he was saying and kept our daughters engaged throughout.  It is amazing what the National trust have done to preserve and refurbish these houses and it really is worth a visit whatever your history in the area or not as these houses were similar to others all over the UK that were inhabited from the start of the 19th century all the way through to the 1970s.  Also make sure you take in the old fashioned sweetshop for some long forgotten memories from your own childhood.
229,Tiny houses with steep stairs but a fabulous insight into a dark place a long time ago.,The National Trust has made an excellent job of preserving the back to backs and each house represents a different era and the different people who lived in them. The tour guide was enthusiastic and clearly had a thorough knowledge of the Back to Backs and the social history of Birmingham.
230,Lost in time,"The Birmingham Back to Backs are a cultural heritage treasure. I was at art college in Birmingham and also worked in Hurst Street just yards away from these houses and was completely unaware of their existence. The guide, John,  was excellent at creating images of the past, the hardship of so many people living in such close proximity and the squalid conditions which had to be endured but ignored by the civic authorities.  I would happily visit again tomorrow."
231,Hidden in plain sight,Have wanted to visit the back to backs for years but despite living in Birmingham we only just got round to it.Our tour guide Jeff was very entertaining and knowledgable and his passion for the back to backs really added to the enjoyment of our visit.I genuinely feel this is the best national trust experience on offer as well as a great day out in Birmingham! I will definitely be doing this tour again in the future.
232,Fantastic hidden gem ,"This is a necessary place to visit for anyone interested in the history and conditions of the working poor in Industrial England.  Through a series of restored back to back houses one can trace the history of living conditions in the 1840's to the 1930's.  Our guide, John was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly."
233,Amazing hidden gem,"We had a lovely trip to the Birmingham back to back, Jeff was brilliant, very knowledgeable and brought a lot of humour to the tour."
234,First Time in Birmingham - Made Our Weekend,"We visited with our 6 and 3 year old daughters, and were a little worried beforehand about whether the guided tour would be over the heads and boring for our little ones. We needn’t have worried as the guide was absolutely fantastic and made sure to make the information presented relevant to them while still giving details to the adults. Despite the tour lasting nearly 2 hours they were interested throughout, and afterwards were able to recall what they had found out.  The guide got each member of the party to act out different aspects of the families’ lives and really made it come to life.We also visited the exhibition upstairs from the gift shop, where the children got to dress up and our course the sweet shop (which was their bribe for being sensible during the tour)I found the tour fascinating and really enjoyed myself. I can’t believe after living within an hour of this attraction that it has taken us so long to visit!"
235,Excellent visit and Guide,Really enjoyed it..Jeff our tour guide was brilliant.. funny and very informative..Well worth a trip to Birmingham to see how life really was in those days...
236,Hidden gem,"We visited here on Thursday 14th November at 2pm and were taken on the tour by our guide who had lived in the Back to Backs until he was 14. Considering our group varied in ages from 21 to 73 and it was the most wettest, coldest, miserable day we've had in a long while, our guide kept us entertained and interested for the whole hour and a half! His description and knowledge of the houses and history through the ages was amazing and we could picture exactly what it was like to live there as he brought them to life. We would definitely recommend this tour to anyone living in or visiting Birmingham.Thank you."
237,Very Interesting,Jean gave a fabulous tour on Thurs 14th Nov. It was so interesting and she is clearly passionate about the subject. Unlike some other NT properties we were able to touch and look at some of the artefacts quite closely which added another layer to the experience. With her wealth of knowledge on the families and lifestyle it was easy to imagine life in those difficult times. Would thoroughly recommended. Thank you Jean! Well done National Trust!
238,Young children included,"Well on our second attempt to visit we wer not disappointed! Previously we had tried to do the tour with my mum but it was full. Book in advance! We thoroughly enjoyed this celebration of how the NT rescues preserves and brings places back to life! Jeff was very knowledgable, passionate about birmingham and is a credit to the NT! Faultless visit. Thank you"
239,A fantastic tour.,"We didn’t realise this was here until very recently and were disappointed that on our first visit there were no spaces available for a tour. However, we can see why it is so popular. Our guide Jeff was so passionate about the site and presented the information in a really good way. The tour lasted almost 2 hours but seemed to pass very quickly and we learnt and saw so much. The children really enjoyed it too and Jeff involved them in the tour where appropriate. It was nice to be shown around in a small group and the stories of the residents from different times were fascinating. We are planning our next visit so we can take in even more!"
240,Weekend Away,We visited the Back to Backs on Friday 4th Oct. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and really made us feel like we knew the families who had lived in the houses. We did feel so sorry for Adalaide!!A lovely couple of hours followed by some sweet purchases from Candies!
241,Extended family outing,"We had a brilliant tour of the Back to Backs with our very informative tour guide Jeff. He took us through time in a relaxed and friendly environment; a great story teller with lots of interaction, enabling us to ask many questions. We learnt so much about this period in history and had a thoroughly enjoyable hour and a half tour. A trip definitely worth doing and a huge well done to the National Trust for saving a small part of our important heritage."
242,S.Burton,What a great experience the tour is just great.Really takes you back with  expert information from Jeff our tour guide. A brilliant time well spent in the middle of Brum
243,Entrancing tour of Back to Backs,"We had a tour with Charles who was a knowledgeable delight. The restoration of these back to backs is superb , very well done and interesting. The comparison between the lifestyle of these houses and the rest of the buildings being erected in Victorian Birmingham is hard to compare. Well worth a visit"
244,Excellent tour of Backs to Backs,"We especially came to Birmingham from London for a weekend, to see this attaction.  We were not disappointed.  Jeff was a superb guide telling us stories of a past age.  He gave enough details to be ""just right"" and be aware of what it was like to be living in a Back to Back.  I am always thankful for the comforts of my 2019 home but even more so after this visit.  Approaching the site on foot, we felt that there were not enough ""brown"" signs to point us in the right direction.  Outside the attraction, it was unusual to see a National Trust sign in not the traditional colours"
245,Visit to this fantastic National Trust atraction,The back to backs was a very different national trust experience. We had a fantastic tour guide called Jeff Williams. It was wonderful to see such a wide range of artefacts from the different time periods and hear about the stories of the tenants that lived in the houses.
246,A Great Trip Down Memory Lane,"Excellent and informative visit to these houses. Jane was pleasant, communicative humourous and knowledgeable of the history and shared with the group many stories. One of the best tours I have been on"
247,An extremely informative visit!,My friend and I visited Back to Backs earlier today with the 2:30pm tour and frankly: it was awesome! Our tour guide Carl was absolutely epic; with an enormous amount of knowledge about the families who lived in the properties and the general history of Birmingham. He clearly conveyed how their lives interacted with that of the wider Birmingham life; as well as managing to include some humour in the tour! Thank you very much for wonderful day out!
248,Great informative tour,Our tour guide John made this a fascinating trip through time. He was careful to include the children and they remained interested throughout.The hour and half was packed with detail and gave a in depth insight into the deprivation that families dealt with.A must see visit for visitors or brummies alike. Our kids loved it (10 and 11)
249,Amazing and learned a lot!,Jeff Williams was excellent and brought to life what is was like to live in what was true poverty. His personal experience of his parents living in back to backs added to an outstanding visit. This was a nostalgic visit for us having moved from Birmingham nearly 50 years ago
250,Fantastic tour ,"Looking for Court 10 no 3 Camden Street or Court 3 no 2 back Ruston Street, Ladywood?  My grandad was a goldbeater as was my grandad when he was little. We found these addresses and occupations from 1871 1881 1891 and 1901 censuses.  For a couple from Kansas, the addresses were obscure, but visiting Back to Backs helped us understand my heritage.  Thanks National Trust and dedicated volunteers like John for preserving history.  This was the best part of our trip to Birmingham and helps us understand the emigration to Canada start a new life.  Visited 13 November 2019."
251,Excellent. History tour.,"As members of the National Trust this has been on our list to visit for a while ... and it completely exceeded expectations. It does need to be booked in advance, but it is definitely worth a bit of planning for, and is situated in an interesting part of Birmingham (Very near the Electric Cinema which I recommend!) The site says the tour involves stairs with tight corners, so as long as you are able then it’s a fascinating insight into history that you can almost relate to. As our tour guide acknowledged, a lot of National Trust properties are stately homes representative of aristocracy. So it’s nice to almost see history from below and how regular people lived from the industrial revolution onwards. It’s also very hands on with rooms laid out with items from the period that really bring it to life. Our tour guide - Kay - was fantastic. Just brilliant. Warm, funny, enthusiastic, knowledgable and someone who really bought history to life. The tour lasted 2 hours and I honestly thought it had been only an hour or so. You just got so absorbed you don’t notice time flying by. A totally different NT experience from the norm, but absolutely brilliant."
252,"My favourite ever National Trust property, with a tour from my favourite ever guide, Jeff","My partner and I had a wonderful afternoon at the back to backs. Jeff was an informative and entertaining tour guide. I had great grandparents on both sides of my family that had lived in Inge Street and the visit today helped me to see how they would of lived and worked. I really do recommend a visit for all the family as, I could see how children would love it equally."
253,Excellent living review in the heart of Birmingham,"A fabulous visit once again, Jeff our guide was excellent and very knowledgeable, even our eight year old daughter listened, asked questions and had a great time, if you’ve not been get a visit booked soon it’s a must, we’ll visit again for sure, don’t forget the sweet shop takes you right back, it’s a hard choice to pick so be prepared to be walking out with more than you intended 🤣"
254,Murder mystery,Had a really enjoyable tour today at 10:30. I *think* our guide was called John (sorry if that’s wrong!). He was awesome. Really interesting and I recommend this to anyone in Brum and interested in working class life of yesteryear in the Midlands or North of England.
255,Amazing visit and tour,Different parts are themed for differing periods of time and the experience of walking through time as you moved from room to room gave a real insight to those who came before us.
256,Great visit,Paul Gardener was our guide on this very hot day in the back to backs. Paul was both informative and enthusiastic about what he was describing. Although I am local I had not visited here before but learnt alot about how some of my predecessors lived. The first room not only looked liked my great grandparents but the smell of the old coal fire was like a step back in time. I won't spoil the tour but suggest you go if in the area. The reviews speak for themselves and the story is a real eye opener for younger people who certainly could not relate to the not so distant past. Excellent alround 2 hour visit.
257,Excellent and informative ,"Jeff was an amazing dude, knew everything happening. Small rooms but groups are small to so it's not really a problem. Great sweeties from the vintage shop."
258,Fabulous back to backs,An excellent National Trust property situated in the centre of Birmingham consisting of renovated Back to Back housing  occupied by shopkeepers and workers in the 19th and early 20th Century. Visits are by prearranged tours booked in advance and are very popular. The tours were very informative hosted by well informed guides who were also able to deal with visitors' questions. This is due to space constraints and there are many narrow stairs involved. A ' must do ' when in Birmingham.
259,excellent! cannot recommend this place enough.,"This I post on the 'Back to Backs'  venue section as  TripAdvisor  does not have a section for the  Back to Backs  Cottage Holiday Accommodation.Do go on the guided tours of the Back to Backs - they are interesting and worthwhile.I had booked to stay nine nights arriving on a Saturday in September(I had stayed previously in both numbers  52 and 54) to find that my booking  could not be honoured because of an electrical fault. The NT had not messaged me to advise me of this so preventing me from cancelling my trip. They did refund  my payment for booking and also three nights in a hotel but their lack of information and provision of alternative accommodation for the remaining six nights cost me an unexpected £500 extra. To say nothing of my disappointing a friend who had expected to share a pleasant week.What I had expected to be a relaxing week and two days turned into an expensive nightmare. Very poor customer service. I have, as a result, determined never to give another penny to the NT."
260,History in the city,"The 2 hour tour was informative and interesting, if a little over long with quite a bit of climbing up narrow staircases.  If you husband or partner isn't keen, then there's a Wetherspoons directly opposite!"
261,Going back in time,My late father was born in a back to back in Nechells Park Road Birmingham in 1920. The youngest of six children. Being in the 1930's house was very emotional for me. I was so glad i visited and will definitely return. The guide was excellent.
262,A wonderful afternoon,My sister and I took my mum for her birthday and what a brilliant time we had. It was very informative but also I don't think any of us have ever laughed so much in such a long time. A big thank you to Jeff the fabulous tour guide and the other 4 people in the party who made it such a memorable time.
263,Step back in time,"Back to Backs is a wonderfully nostalgic and spell-binding trip down memory lane, taking you on a journey to experience how people lived in this part of Birmingham in days gone by.Our National Trust tour guide Tony Skelton, himself a Brummie, was a font of knowledge, providing not only an in-depth insight into how tough life must have been for the inhabitants of the time, but doing so with true passion, warmth and no little humour. Through Tony, who expertly brought this quite humbling history lesson to life, we relived the days of no electricity, no running water, candlelight, cramped bedrooms, cesspits and, luxury of luxuries, outdoor privies! One warning - if you have mobility issues you will want to avoid the stairs, which are winding, narrow and steep. All in all then a marvellous tour - there is also a little museum above the Trust shop and a cute little corner sweet shop. It’s an absolute must-do should you visit Birmingham. Well done the NT for all the hard work carried out to restore this last surviving court of back to backs. Inspirational.John W, Swansea"
264,Steeped in history,"Absolutely enthralling place to visit. Advance booking is essential and it's a guided tour with limited numbers but this makes the experience as the guides are knowledgeable and the atmosphere is friendly. Three houses and a tailor's shop are set out as they would have been at various dates moving from 1840 to 2001 and it's a real eye-opener into the way the working classes lived and worked in the centre of an industrial city. Full marks to the National Trust for the restoration, it's superb. (Must also give a mention to the sweet shop in the corner, if you're from the Birmingham area and remember troach drops you can get them there!)"
265,WONDERFUL,"My wife and I are NT members and this was our second visit to the Back to Backs. This said we had a wonderful time with Jeff our guide who made the visit interesting, funny, serious and educational. His knowledge was second to none. His told us little ditties and snipetts about the real previous tennents of the homes which was fasinating. He made the houses and lives of these people real and gave us a real insight into what a difficult life these families must have gone throught, but also a real sense of community. Well worth a visit and a walk through time that has stood still."
266,Two hours of nostalgia ,"From the moment you walk into the first back to back and smell the fire you are engaged in this really interesting and informative tour.  There were lots of items on show that were used by the residents (tools for making clock hands in the house,  dollys for washing their clothes and much more).  It brought memories back to me, and my girls (13 and 14) said they had had a lovely day there. Our guide John is a local lad and was so knowledgeable about the houses and their residents and passionate about the area and its history.  Some of the stairs are very steep so be warned."
267,A day well spent,"Booked our tour which started on time with a group of 11 of us.  Our guide John was simply brilliant and explained in great detail how life was over 4 different periods, going from house to house.  It took almost two hours from beginning to end.  It is definitely not one to be missed.  Big thank you to our guide John."
268,We love jeff,"Thank you Theresa for this very interesting visit. You are a great guide and these premises are exceptional. Good thing you are in the European Union, the grant must have been very helpful...Only negative aspect, it went a bit too fast and we did not have enough time to ask many questions. I will certainly come back with my students !"
269,A little hidden gem,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Back to Backs.  Thank you  to the very informative and entertaining guide John. Feel like I have definitely travelled through time. . 3rd time for me but first with my 8 year old daughter who also enjoyed it a great deal.
270,Experience the history,This is an amazing experience and well worth a visit. Thanks to Jeff our amazing guide. He was so knowledgeable and was able answer everyone’s questions.Well worth a visit 😍
271,Birmingham Back to Backs,"National trust property, showing industrial / residential homes where people lived and engaged in light industrial work. The hours were long, the conditions sparse and pay was minimal. An absolute must for anyone who wants to understand conditions for people in the 1850 - 1960 period. Fascinating, poignant and scary."
272,Fantastic visit,If you are interested in finding out social history this is a great experience. Being a member of the National trust helps with cost but it should not put you off going if you have to pay full price. You do need to book as only small groups are taken around each time. This makes the experience personal and hands on. You are able to sit and go around the back to backs really getting involved in the visit.
273,Back to Backs,"Without fail one of the most interesting tours I’ve ever been on... this group are exceptional!! The houses have been restored and staged in such magnificent detail, the information is eye opening and the guides are sooo full of factoids we all didn’t want the tour to end! They warned about narrow stairs but honestly these are totally manageable... to anyone passing through Birmigham... visit this historical treasure and treat yourself to a sweet from the Candy store as a reward"
274,Very interesting,We had missed this opportunity during our visit as the trip closes by 3 pm and pre booking was must to go on a visit..  It's one hour thirty minutes trip around ancient living.. . To book in advance
275,Nostalgic trip Back down memory lane,My family & I finally managed to get on one of the tours and have to say that it was simply one of the best national trust tours that we have been on.  Jeff our guide was a delight and had some great stories and jokes.  The work the trust have done here is fantastic and a place that we will definitely be coming back to.  I cannot recommend this place enough and it makes me proud to be a Brummie.
276,Time Flies...,"Book this and you wont be disappointed, had a great tour by Jeff yesterday, he was so informative, and a really great tour guide , Brilliant insight into how people lived. Very well done. Thoroughly recommended."
277,Don't miss when in Brum,"We weren't sure what to expect when I booked this tour via the National Trust but we were absolutely delighted with it.  It's basically a tour around these wonderfully restored back to back houses, their history and the families who occupied them down the decades. Our guide, Pat, was lovely.  Knowledgeable and humorous she held all our attention throughout the tour as we progressed from one house to another.  It really opened our eyes and it is fantastic that our social history has been maintained in this way.  Well worth the £9.50 ticket cost.  I would definitely recommend. A big thank you to the volunteers who do a sterling job of administering and guiding the tours."
278,Fascinating insight to past lives,I have visited here on several occasions over the past few years. It is a great place to visit and spend a couple of hours being taken back in time two hundred years or so. Guides are always knowledgeable and amusing and if visiting Birmingham it should not be missed....
279,"Exceptional, no other description.","We have been members of the national trust for some years and have always wanted to go to the back to backs. We were not disappointed, Dave the tour guide was both informative and knowledgeable on the history and people that lived there. Felt as if we had been transported back in time. Great place."
280,First Class,"We arrived at Comfort Inn on 16 February 2020, which is very near to the New Street station, just a short walking distance. Our hotel room is on the first floor and it's very comfortable with large room.  There are many halal restaurants in Birmingham so we don't have to worry about food. Most of the shops are also within walking distance (Primarks, Marks & Spencer's, Waterstones and many more)"
281,Great glimpse into the past.,"Went here a few weeks ago having booked previously, we are NT members. Went around in a group of about ten people and enjoyed a few hours tour with a very informed and often funny guide. I enjoyed this more than more formal visits as you could relate to it more. Fully recommend the Back to Back Houses but as I said before, book in advance."
282,Amazing day,Jean did an incredible job of showing the truth of the Back to Backs in a respectful but humorous way. I am an American visiting Birmingham and so I didn’t know much of the information that I learned. Great value for the cost as well. Much better than comparable historical tours.
283,Fantastic tour ,"We booked is less time than is advised on the web site, hoping that mid week in February, we'd get in and thankfully, we did!The guide, Carl, was very good and engaged with us all in the group.  We learned so much about life in the time.   It was very, very hard.A must do if exploring the City."
284,Great place to visit,"We were taken round in a larger than normal group as a guide had phoned in sick but Jeff (with a J) was an excellent guide who told it like it was, warts and all!!  Jeff’s grandparents had lived in a similar property so he was able to put a personal spin on the visit.  Amazing that this property is still standing but I’m so pleased it is.  The tailor’s shop at the end was fantastic, all the brown paper patterns were hung from the walls and the sewing machines were still on the bench.  Lots of narrow steep stairs but nobody rushed us and once in each room we were able to sit down and listen to the stories of the people who had lived there.  Brilliant!!!"
285,Very interesting,"First off, I emailed the site asking for a spot on the tour that same week and asked that they email me as  traveling with an American phone and calls are expensive. Got an email back very quickly with a spot on the day I wanted! So appreciative! The tour started in time with Dick the guide. He was very friendly and knowledgeable. The history is fantastic! I will say that I did this tour on a dreary cold day so that impacted my review as I was cold. I thought the 90 min tour could have gone faster, but again it’s probably jus because I was cold. I recommend doing this tour."
286,What a hidden gem,We went as 18 group of school age children was very good we were split up into groups.  they were fascinated at the way people use to live. the story telling you had from the guide in every room was very good. lovely sweet shop and a small museum.
287,Specific visit to Birmingham to see the Back to Backs,We were shown around the back to backs by Joan Shephard who was very knowledgeable.  She was very passionate about the history of the houses and this made for a highly interesting tour. The back to backs are a very short walk from the city centre so hard very easy to get to.
288,Great time at back to backs,If you’re thinking of coming here... then don’t hesitate. Great value for money at £9.50 for a 90 minute tour. The tour guide Roma was very knowledgeable and made it special as she included stories and experiences from other visitors who had met her over the years. She also allowed other members of our tour to reminisce with their own stories despite the time constraints. Would definitely recommend and return myself.
289,Brilliant Place,"What a wonderful tour today. Jeff, one of the volunteers, was so erudite and informative. He made the tour one of the best National Trust experiences that I have encountered. His sense of humour, obvious empathy and enthusiasm for his role, made it a standout talk. The hands-on approach, unlike some other , look but don’t touch tours, brought the whole thing to life! If you get the chance, don’t miss it!"
290,Great place to visit but advance booking is absolutely essential...,"For us this was the best National Trust tour we have ever taken. Our guide, Kay, was so informative and funny. She brought the history of the houses to life. The National Trust have done an amazing job restoring and staging the houses during different eras. Excellent trip and we would definitely recommend the experience."
291,Vintage Shop,"We had a tour with Geoff on Sunday and we were really impressed with the whole experience. Geoff was informative, engaging and made the tour fun. We really enjoyed discovering about the families that lived there and understanding a piece of Birmingham's history. Thanks for a great tour Geoff"
292,Wonderful memories ,"Visiting the Back to Backs was something I'd been wanting to do for a long time, both for reasons of a great interest in the history of my native city and also because my mother had spent her early childhood living in a Back to Back just a few miles away in Aston. The experience, while very emotional for me, was absolutely fascinating from a historical point of view, as we were given a riveting insight into almost two hundred years of life in Birmingham, viewed through the perpective of the lives of families who actually lived in the Back to Backs, and, later, the businesses who traded there including, right up to the turn of the 21st century, the renowned Birmingham tailor George Saunders.I can't speak highly enough of our tour guide, who was expert, passionate about her subject, delighted to answer questions and elaborate on any topics, and could find just the right balance of humour in sometimes grim topics.My wife and I, both 63, had huge fun with the collection of household objects and implements you can pick up and examine - they brought back so many memories of our childhoods. The hour and a half flew by, and we'll definitely be paying another visit soon.I'd unreservedly recommend the Back to Backs to anyone, but particularly if you are interested in the history of the Midlands and North between the early 19th and late 20th centuries.. ...and I haven't talked about Council House milk and miskins in a very long time! A huge ""thank you"" to the National Trust."
293,Great visit,"This attraction is well worth a visit. It is usually necessary to pre-book.Visitors are taken on a guided tour and our guide, a Mr. Millington , I believe, was very knowledgeable and made the visit top notch"
294,A glimpse into Birmingham’s past.,"The tour is compulsory, must be booked in advance and took about 2 hours in the end, but it was really interesting throughout. The houses are fascinating - far too clean and well maintained to exactly represent what they would have been like to live in but the guide fills in all the (sometimes grim)details. Bravo to the National Trust for saving this site to educate us about the less glamorous side of urban life. How lovely to be in a huge city and have something do other than tramp around shops. The Lemon Sherbets bought from the super cute, traditional sweet shop after the tour were the best I’ve ever had."
295,An excellent tour,"This is a National Trust place in the centre of Birmingham, less than 10 minutes walk from New Street Station. You need to book in advance to reserve a place, it's guided tour only. We reserved a place on the 11.15am tour & spent a very interesting & fascinating 1h 30m on the guided tour. The guide, an elderly gentleman whose name I can't remember, was a Brummie, & so was able to pass on many anecdotes about life & growing up in post WWII Birmingham. Definitely a place not to be missed if you visit Birmingham. There is also a small exhibition to visit, & a sweet shop!!"
296,so interesting,"You do need to pre-book for a tour and this lasts for 1 1/2 hours.  Our guide, John, made it all very interesting and with a sense of fun too.  There were quite a few steep staircases to contend with which some less mobile people might struggle to use but you are pre-warned about that when booking and there are some chairs in most rooms where you could sit if you needed too.We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and learnt such a lot - would definitely recommend it for anyone visiting Birmingham and for people, like ourselves, who live in the area because it is fascinating."
297,Go back in time...,"Having ""discovered"" a second cousin in Australia, we agreed to meet at the Back to Backs for the first time when she was visiting the UK. It was fascinating to see how our common great grandmother and grandmothers lived, brought all the more to life by excellent tour guide John. Great fun to experience history brought so vividly to life and thoroughly recommended."
298,History brought to life by the guide,"it was our wedding anniversary, a bit of a faff at the beginning as our booking got mixed up. We did manage to go round just on time as they gave us an earlier slot, but as a member I was a bit upset and the sweet shop was not open either.The volunteer cannot remember her name we were on the 10:15 slot on the 14.09.19 she was really passionate and knowledgable. We stayed in a back to back in Huddersfield 25 years ago so was particularly interesting for us. Well recommended but please sort out your booking process."
299,A great example of what the NT is all about,"We booked our tour in advance, and as we arrived a few minutes before our tour was due to start we had a look around the little museum above the shop before going down to meet our guide. In a small group, we were escorted around the courtyard and through a series of back-to-back houses, up and down narrow, steep staircases. Our guide was knowledgeable, friendly, and never patronising. We were never hurried, but our guide led us from room to room at a comfortable pace. The tour was very interesting and time seemed to pass very quickly -- when we finished the tour we were amazed to discover that we'd spent the whole afternoon in the 'back-to-backs'! I'd recommend this tour for teens and adults rather than families with young children. Warning: the stairs are very steep and narrow!"
