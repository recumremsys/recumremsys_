16,Nice religious place,It is on Hill top...with too many stairs to climb for. But really worth visiting the place. Its really a good pilgrimage place around 90 kms from Nashik.
17,Very nice,"Been to this place while our second trip from hathgad, this temple is 22km from the nasik saputara main road, this temple is located on the hill, so to reach you need to climb the stairs some 350 to 400 steps uphill or you can take newly started rope way to reach the main temple Rs 80/- for return journey per person, recommended for all devotees especially  senior citizens, here they have good parking facility with a charge of 50/- per vehicle, the rope way has a waiting lounge with toilet facility very neat and clean and with lots of options for dining like snacks or meals at very reasonable prices, its a divine and peaceful place, many peoples from very far distance come here to take the blessings of the goddess. its a must visit place if you are near to the nasik."
18,Excellent place / temple at saptashrungi,"The view of this temple is amazing, situated on a hill top. Although it's about a 100 stairs walk uphill the views from the temple and particularly the deity (Maa Saptashrungi) will blow your mind. This shakti peeth is an awesome experience."
19,Divinely beautiful ,"43kms from Nashik, is the beautiful temple with mythological stories attached to it. 500 stairs up is the main idol. The best thing was the pujaris of the temple actually open & offer the saree and prasad to the devi. When you reach up there are lots of monkeys who love drinking water... so be careful if you carry any bottles & prasad. After your darshan you can go to the Prasadalaya (open only till 2pm), which is nominally priced at Rs.10/- per person. Vani devi sanstha also offers rooms which are on 01st come 01st serve basis. You can also visit Panchvati which is on the way to temple, 02kms from Hotel Rama Heritage. Overall breathtaking view with serenity of Saptashrungi. From Hotel Rama Heritage, this temple is just 30-40mins drive. :)"
20,This very good place in view nature and religion both.,"This temple is about 65 KMs from Nashik and is in the midst of seven peaks. The drive is good and there is ample parking space. You have the choice of going to the temple through around 500 footsteps or you can take a funicular train, which reaches you to the top in a minute. There are several food stalls and curio shops at the base. The view from the temple complex is amazing with a panoramic view around."

23,Shakti Peeth Saptashrungi Mata,"This temple is based on a hill and we had to climb few steps , took around 20 minutes.They are also building rope way which will be operational  by June . Photos inside temple are not allowed. All steps are covered with roof so we were not exposed to scorching sun."
24,Beautiful and well developed,"Very nice place ,At least once we have to visit this place. Highly spiritual temple has nearly 300 to 400 steep steps ."
25,List of places to visit in Nashik,This place is all about greenery and temple. It is very beautiful but u need to walk a lot. We saw people arranging poojas there.
26,Good feel of mountaining.,This is the good location awesome feeling in reach there .. mata sapashrungi I was go there two times this is located in approx 40 km from nashik if you go there feels realy good weather hight of there almost good who loved driving sort distance but enjoyable. .

28,Visit to Saptashrungi from Nasik,A temple located on hill with amazing landscapes.  Place is peaceful and relaxing. Went on family trip to take Darshan of Saptashrungi devi. A must visit place near from Nashik.
29,Holy place,Beautiful place and the temple is very peaceful and one feels blessed being there. Now its very easy to use a path known rope way which is a tram which has air-conditioned facilities and well maintained. It just took less than 2minutes to reach the temple once we board the tram. Darshan queue was a very systematic and very well managed. The way to the temple has beautiful surrounding which have wonderful climate.A must visit religious temple. Tourism should be promoted as the climate is so fresh and place is extremely peaceful.
30,Awesome visit...,"As we stayed at Club Mahindra, Hatgad, we decided to visit this temple which is atop a hill and around 25 kms from Wani.The cable car was not in operation and we climbed those steep steps to reach the top.Just 2 mandala before the temple at the top, the crowd started accumulating and became standstill as they were allowing people in groups after every 15 minutes or so.It was a scary situation as we were all standing packed on the steps and one single wrong movement would have ended up in a stampede killing people. Added to this was ladies with frenzy of Devi and a handicapped guy pushing the crowd  which really scared us.The ultimate entry and darshan of Devi cooled down our mind and feelings.Rtn J Ganesh"
31,Holy pilgrimage,This area is surrounded by the mointains and having the best place... which will definitely impress you....
32,Godess Saptashrungi,Temple to be reached by climbing about 500+ steps. The place is divine and holy. But needs lot of maintenance. Crowd managements deserves lot more attention.
33,Very beautiful place ,"In our 16 day long journey we were excited about Saptashrungi segment from starting !! the place is truely amazing !! Power of Goddess can be felt. It took 2 hrs from nashik in Taxi and taxi owner took Rs 2700 + tolls up and down from us !! we reached Saptashrungi place around 6:30pm and we started climbing the stairs! We had two senior citizens in our group and both not very healthy but Goddess called us easily, we all reached hill top in no difficulty. we took 4-5 times halt but soon reached hill top !!In front of Goddess Saptashrungi their is 3 Imprints of Feets of Goddess and the one one the extreme right is most sacred  and oldest as per local information !!descending the stairs is very easily and takes nearly 15-20mins !! we reaching down the hill by 8pm and had dinner in Devi's Prasadalaya !! it is at fine but walking distance  !! You can go by asking the address from local shop owners The most important thing about the Prasadalaya is that devi's prasad from here only went up to the hill for devi's bhog !! and remaining can be dined by the devotees by Rs 10-15 ticketMust visit the temple and prasadalaya....."
34,Saptashrungi by rope way,"About 60 kms from Nashik.. Very nice view points while we drive to top of the mountain. For temple we need to climb about 250 steps, but it is worth every bit."
35,Saptashrungi garh,"The temple is one of the important shrines. This place has some awesome monkeys and it is good to carry some groundnut, bananas amongst other eatables.The ropeway train reaches the temple in less than 10 minutes. It is worth a visit if you visiting Nashik."
36,Solo Trip to Saptashrungi,The Saptashrungi Devi place is situated in Satpura Range this place is known as for 'Aai Saptashrungi'..Aai Saptashrungi is Also Know For Sade Teen Shakti Peeth in Maharashtra...
37,Religious Visit,"You would take around 3 hours by road to reach from Nashik. It's a small temple on a hill accessible by a ropeway that is 2 min trip. The view is nice, however beyond that nothing much there"
38,Mighty goddess,"You have to walk through the steps which older people weak people may not do,rest the temple is In Excellent manangement & Administration.The village is alcohol free with women struggling and keeping guard on the same"
39,Hidden Gem of Maharashtra with amazing view and a treat for the trekkers!!,"It is almost 1 hour from Saputara. Half road is damaged and further is perfect till Mandir. Must have 6 to 7 hours, if you are visiting from Saputara.Avoid in weekends and festival seasons because of rush of local devotees."
40,One should not miss the apportunity to see this beautiful place,Temple is situated around 82 kms from Nashik. Road for this location is in good condition with awesome view.  Temple is at hill top and there is small town below the hill. There are two routes one for climbing up and other one is for coming down after visit.Place is crowded during Tuesday and Friday. Few part of Temple is under construction and rope way to the hill top is also under trial.
41,Saptashrungi Devi garh (Vani),"The temple is located on the mountain more of 500 + steps but now the cable train facility is very convenient one can reach just within a min in the temple.Footwears need to be kept downstairs at the counters and all the puja prasad is available in the shops below before we sit in the cable train.Its very very convinient for senior citizens even.Once you enter the temple there are lots of monkeys to welcome you..so better take care of the handbags.One can get bundi ladoo prasad at Rs.10 at the exit.Once you exit and come downstairs there is a food court where one can get thali meal or other  food like Chinese ,South Indian dishes.But dont immediately travel after having meal as it's a hilly ..roads with lots of zig zag turns.Either have meal before taking darshan or if later please dont travel immediately."
42,Pleasure to be here Again,"Been to this place while return trip from hathgad, this temple is 22km from the nasik saputara main road, this temple is located on the hill, so to reach you need to climb the stairs some 350 to 400 steps uphill, not recommended for senior citizens until they start the rope way which is almost ready to stat any day soon, its a divine and peaceful place, many peoples from very far distance come here to take the blessings of the goddess."
43,Attractive place,The location of the temple is simply amazing. It's at a height and the surrounding is complete with greenery all around. There is a strong wind blowing always. But the downside is there is not a single good hotel if you want to stay overnight. Although there is nothing worth spending a night as well. The temple is at a height of 500 steps which you will have to climb barefoot and go. It is not difficult and anyone can easily do so.
44,Nice place with lots of stairs and walk,This is very good atrractive and picnic place. Peoole love to come here. This location between seven mountains.
45,a holy place,"I visited the temple during last weekend. Its exactly 240 kms from mumbai. I strtd at 7 frm my house and rchd thr at 12. I took two breaks in between. Went upto nashik and then after a big flyover in nashik city, i took a u turn for some distance and then went inside city to reach thr via vani. The state highway was ok types and not so bad. Last 14 kms of journey was totally in hills with lot of hairpin bands and i suggest u not to take to drive if u arent an expert driver.I parked the car in one of the poooja material shop after many of them were jumping onto my car. The person charged me 200 rs for a pooja stuff of just 30-40 rs. I knew i was being overcharged but i still paid him otherwise they would have told me to remove my car from there. After reaching top, it felt a sense of relief. Mata was there sitting in hill and we took her blessing and then left for nashik..."
46,Breathtaking darshan of Saptashrungi mata atop the hill.,About 60kms from Nashik is the most reverted saptashurngi Temple on the hill. Very sarin and beautifully maintained. You can drive up to a certain point and then there are steps which are not too difficult for healthy people. There are dolis for those who have difficulty in climbing at a cost. The temple trust has accommodation if you wish to stay. The goddess is supposed to fulfil your wishes. There is definitely peace and bless at the temple.
47,Weekend trip,In a very scenic location. can be really crowded during holidays & festivals. Food outlets are not very hygienic. Only basic services available.
48,Darshan,"The Devi is very famous as one of three and half  ""peeths"" of Godess .The temple is other wise very simple, situated in the Sahyadri Mountains.One should visit it mainly as a pilgrimage centre and not with an idea of visiting any ancient temple  like other temples in Maharashtra famous for carving(like Khidrapur near Sangli)"
49,Decent place to visit and also experience funicular trolley. Beware of Monkeys,This is an amazing place blessed with devotion and mesmerising scenery’s view . This gives u a feeling of contempt and peace . Ladders are used to reach upto temple and for Devi Darshan . Temple is at hill hence gives amazing view of greenery being at the top of hill
50,Divine place but be aware of touts on the road,"About 65kms from Nashik city.. this is a Godess Saptashrungi Temple situated at hill top.The zigzag road in the ghat section is fun driving on.. and from the point where vehicles can reach, there are steps that climb up to the temple itself. Recently a ropeway connectivity has been launched which is like a tram that works very efficiently using the gravity. It's like one tram goes up and the other one comes down.. both are interconnected over a pulley at the top end. That's some engineering thing !The ropeway transport is air conditioned and well maintained.It is believed that Godess once kicked a monster and he hit one of the hills so hard making a hole and passed through the hill and died. You get to see the hole from some road there. It basically is a place for spiritual people !"
51,Nice view,"Great place to be on holidays.. we visited the place and the atmosphere of the area was good the improvements done in Temple made now are great.ideal place to be with Family, friends kids as the devotional as well as adventure feeling are fulfilled at this place defiantly go for it in navratri as well as holidays"
52,Saptashrungi ,"An amazing place to visit. The temple is at hilltop but you don't have to walk much, facilities are awesome. Neat and clean, good staff too. If you are with a handicapped or old age person, they don't have to walk at all, they have elevators everywhere. The temple also is beautiful and well managed."
53,Amazing,"The place is great outdoor spot for religious believers and adventure lovers. The temple is reachable through stairs. Those up for action, can trek up to the summit of the hill."
54,Saptashrungi garh,The location of the temple in the mid of the hill is very scenic. The view of adjacent hills is also very nice. Steps are climber-friendly. When I entered the cave temple I was filled with devotion and awe on looking at the huge idol of the divine mother.
55,Steps no more to worship this Goddess,Its holy place Its place of hindu religion Its place for different kind of feel under devi saptashrungi's eye All we enjoy Full track Full road View with seven mountains Rainy season is super enjoyable experience With clouds under you.
56,Holy Place,Saptashrungi place was great for visit. Great view. Perfect place for photography. Must visit with family during morning time.
57,Shakti Pith,The Godess Shri Saptshrungi is our family daity. The location is very beautiful and worth visiting for prayer. I visit very regularly at least once in a month.
58,Nice place to visit,"Place with beautiful landscapes. Roads are beautiful. can have problems with food for non maharashtrians,but this problem can be handled for a day or two. Saputara is a nice place to visit which is 50 kms away from the temple of saptshrungi mata"
59,Saptshrungi Devi Mandir,Purple trips arranged this wonderful trip to Mata saptashrungi fos our group. Although the temple is located on a hill but the journey was pleasurable. The food and stay arrangements were good and travel arrangement was excellent by and air conditioned bus provided by Prasanna purple trips at reasonable price
60,Majestic Hills,"Saptashrungi is always a place where every pilgrims visit at least once in a year and mostly in navaratri. recent visit of mine with family made me realized that there is lots of development in and around this devotee place. but i still feel there is much room and scope available for authorities to upgrade  there for tourist point of view, to attaract more toursit there and to have comfortable visit of all devotees. as compare to other religious places we still left behind to have facilities there and it will surely  have added value to this place."
61,Nice to visit !,"I visited the temple on 26th January 2013 with my wife. It was my fifth visit to this beautiful Shrine. It has close to 1000 steps before you reach near the idol. The weather was very pleasant. This mandir is 1/2 shaktipeeth out of 3.5 peeths in maharashtra. There was huge rush as it was holiday and poornima. It took us 3.5 hrs to reach the top,but was excellent experience. All the people visiting Nashik should definitely visit this temple. Recommended!"
62,Divine and better facilitated now,"Devi is situated on a hill top,one needs to climb 500 steps to enter the  Saptashrungi temple. the temple is well maintained and is of religious importance. All the people visiting Nashik should definitely visit this temple. Recommended!"
63,Devine,Wonderful place. I have visited it 100s of times since my childhood. You feel amazing energy within you once you visit this place.
64,"Well managed place with India's first funicular rail service, that too made in India itself","its a temple of the adi mahashakti goddess and its on the hill in winters its the place where you can get the fresh air and feel that you are near to the mahashakti, its one of the peethas of goddess and its near nashik and motorable ways"
65,Saptashrungi: A simple and peaceful religious destination,It is a wonderful place on top of the hills. Roads are excellent and so is the view from the hill top. A rope way is being constructed and could ease the journey to the top for the aged. Avoid it on Tuesdays and holidays when it becomes overcrowded. Food in and around the area is average. Good and cool weather all round.
66,Beautiful view,"It's a nice holy place,one must visit the place if you are able to climb steps approx.600 steps,management is planning to put lift-trolly in near future,work is going on,not advisable to go in rainy weather bcoz land sliding is happening so if you are planning to go by your own car than must be cautious place is very pleasant and for nature lover,trekking people its heaven on earth,cool place in any season."
67,Saptashrungi Mata Mandir,"Saptashrugi temple is on a hill top. The road to this beautiful temple from Nashik is through breath taking views provided visited in rain months.. Waterfalls, water bodies, hills, clouds, showers...great experience. The delicious peda sold there is a must eat. After darshan one can enjoy snacks and tea in canteen down there."
68,Beautiful,"We took a public transport bus which goes up in the hill. The road while reaching the temple is nice and i felt awesome.There is a market. But this place is not very clean. Many of the shopkeepers persuade you to keep your chappals in their shop and take something from them. Yes if you want to u cn take, but there is a chappal stand at the foot of temple. We need to climb 500 steps. I did not count it. But i think its not 500 less than that becoz it was easy.Here some work is going on all building material here and there. This place needs proper management. i cud nt see any rescue material like fire extinguishers etc. The Devi was so nice. We had nice Darshan. Police are there in temple.We see a nice mountain while climbing steps which has the shape of Lord shiva PindThen we got to know there is a Annachatra here. Its a bit far away from mandir. They charge Rs.15/- for it but that is fine. Here also cleanliness was average. The food was nice.The authorities shud make better arrangement for public. I cud see work here. let see now."
69,Beautiful view with Devi Darshan ,Beautiful place to visit 2hrs from nashik. To have darshan you have to climb on foot on stone steps covered all the way now the work of funicular trolley is near completion and will be completed in say 3 months testing is going on which will facilitate the tourist to reach the Saptashrungi mata temple within 5min and added ride experience .Very nice atmosphere during monsoon days.
70,Saptashrungi devi Vani,Nice place with a typical Indian temple on a mountain top. But in fact its the best part of it. As most part of it can be travelled by car except last approach when you need to climb 1000 odd stares. It gives you a heavenly scenic beauty. On the way you get few stopover points where you can click beautiful photos.
71,Feeling divinity,"Very divine place around 65 Kms from Nashik.The places sees visitors round the year as this being the goddess for Maharashtra.Apart from these, the way to the temple is around 5-6 km of a beautiful uphill trails which a joy to drive. The place is amazing during the rains and winters. its all green and full with waterfalls. Its all foggy and visibility is around 20-25 meters. Once you reach at the top of the hill, vehicles can be parked aside and you have to walk. To reach the temple, around 600 steps are to be climbed.The goddess is swayambhu (self appeared).Instead of diving all the way up, you can walk the mountain and it becomes beautiful trek."
72,Devotion with Beauty,"We visited recently and had a very exciting and interesting trip to the temple of Sapatashrungi goddess.It is half shaktipeeth and along with tulja bhavani,renuka and mahalakshmi temples completes the 3 and half shaktipeeth journey. From nashik it is 2  hrs by road and from shirdi around 3 hrs by road.There are buses but it is advisable to take a taxi as the roads are quite steep up the mountain.Once you reach the base top of the temple you have to climb around 500 steps to and fro either by walk climb or rented palki where 6 people with support on bamboo will pick you up on a chair where you sit.There is a cable car facility under trial and should be operational in few months. The rented palki to and fro the temple will cost you 700 rupees or 10 US dollar.They also help you as tourist guide inside the temple to have darshan without being in the queue and nothing to be paid extra for this.There are donation boxes for offerings inside the sanctum sanctorum of the goddess.While coming out after darshan people put coins on wall to see if the coin sticks .there is a belief that if the coin sticks and you pray for a wish,the wish is fulfilled.it is your luck if the coin sticks to the wall.there is a kalbhairav temple of lord shiva nearby inside the temple.The Goddess Saptashrungi with her multiple hands looks as if she is standing in front of you with blessings.This is a temple to be visited once in a lifetime.Car parking is a little funny.You get free car parking only if you buy offerings from the shops nearby.Please keep your shoes inside the car or at the shop where you buy offerings.There are machine coconut breakers at the entrance of the temple.People break coconuts at the entrance below the temple near the trishul  where the 500 steps starts as well as after coming back from the temple.Prasad is available at the shops which you can offer inside the temple.Plastic is not encouraged so bring your cloth bags or buy one at the shop not to get messy later.Pros - Divine and blessed feeling after the visit,not to be missedCons- Climbing the 500 steps to and 500 fro can make you gasp for breath,if you have asthma,heart problems ,breathlessness or back ache problems then please walk or climb slow or donot walk or climb take the rented palki. Please take care of your shoes as they are not allowed inside the temple at the base.Once the cable car starts then things will be better Overall a very interesting religious trip for all."
73,Divine Place To Seek Blessings,I had visited this place some time back in Aug 2018. Again I visited this place and found that good practices are being maintained as also the overall ambience and cleanliness. A hotel has also come up with reasonable rates for night stay by tourists/pilgrims
74,Fantastic experience,"It is worth visiting. There are two mata temple in vani, one in vani itself and other temple is 22 km from vani situated on hill top. Hundreds of stairs but worth visiting to have mata darshan. Lots of followers were there huge crowd so little time consuming but Scenic views. So plan accordingly and say jai mata di"
75,Worth experiencing by Ropeway/Trolley,"When you are going to Nashik, this place should not be missed. Place is quite aloof and the journey from nashik to saptashrungi is amazing.. Esp the final 5kms.."
76,jai mata di,Must visit this place who love nature. Situated on hill of mountains Goddess saptasrungi temple. You required to take around 400 steps to reach there. Very good place for worship of goddess but there is no washroom facility available nearby. Natural scenery is awesome.
77,Very Poor - Pooja Abhishek & Naivedya (Prasad),"I have been here last month with family. Premises were well kept & clean even though there are thousands of people visiting this attraction each day. There are sort of ""PALKHIS "" which help senior citizens to climb those 500 steps up the hill ata very convenient cost. View from temple above is totally worth watching..Note: You can definately plan one day trip to vani & saputara if you are visiting nashik for a perfect ROUND TRIP with family or friends....:):)"
78,Religious Place,Travelling from trimbak we reached vani at 10 am And started getting up .> about 350 steps >haif an hour to climb up for darshan of mataji > take prasad > perform pooja by brahmin> best place to visit > avoid saturday sunday tuesday friday otherwise place is very nice Lots of hotels for breakfast. But for stay not so good
79,Nice view from the top,Its holly place to visit. This place was very attractive. To reach some amount of physical activity require. surrounding was very beautiful.
80,Heart touching,"The most historic and religious place. It is one the important holy place of three and half Shakti peethas. Climbing stairs test your physical fitness. very good place. The arrangements of stay, food are very good. Attending mahapooja at 5 of clock in early morning is a great experience. Maata Saptrashrungi was family daity of the grate Saint Dyaneshwar and we being descendants, she is our family daity also."
81,The Views at the Top are worth the climb,A nice road trip to go up to top of mountain and then more than 100 steps to the temple !! but I would suggest a better option go hiking from the base vilage i.e. the nanduri village. specially during the monsoon season . the trek is not that hard also not easy.
82,Jai mata di,It's very nice and beautiful place. Divine place. Awesome atmosphere. Funicular trolley saves time and got effortless Darshan.
83,Source of Godavari,"Its one of the beautiful places you will love to visit again and again. Saptashrungi devi is my kul devati and visit this place every year in the month of June or July. Though u will be tired climbing 500 steps, it will be vanished once u look into eyes of that Goddess. Shez so pretty and adorable that words cant explain the pleasant feeling. Overall its a wonderful place and everyone who are planning to visit should must make it. Good luck and safe journey for your trip. Jai mata di :)"
84,Saptashrungi Devi,This place is situated in vani village which is in between saputara and nashik city. One can visit this place by any type of vehicle. In monsoon the scenery is difficult to describe in words. The road has many turns so to be careful while driving. The main idol of devi is placed on the walls of the mountain. The temple is very good and must visit place for travellers.
85,"Good crowd management, cleanliness and approach roads can be improved",This is one of the temples of a deity named Saptashrungi which is situated atop a mountain as always. As it happens with most of the gods and goddesses in India who like to reside on top of the mountain. There is quite a climb and requires physical activity.
86,Go during Rains to Enjoy the Greenry,"It is around 75 kms from Nasik has a temple of saptashrungi devi ( considered a shaktipeeth for the religious) on a cliff. Need to climb 500 steps to reach it. Also a funicular trolley  has been installed for the convenience of the people but yet to commence operation as in APRIL'2016, may be some time in future. A small village provides spectacular view of the satpuras and shayadri ranges. A lot of historical forts are located in surrounding area in radius of 50 km. Most accessible and close being hatgadh at a distance of 40 km. Worth visiting for a day out ."
87,Visit,"Cool Place. Nice drive from Mumbai via Nashik. The climb on the hill is nice and roads are well maintained. Parking is a problem. Search for govt parking  else you have pay 500 to buy some useless sarees. The Rope-way is great experience. Very well maintained and professional. Once you reach the top, The queue is not much.. 30 mins maybe. Beware of monkeys. You can stay on the top if you want to feel the mountain ranges. So if you are in Nashik visit SaptaShrungi and on the way visit Swami Samarth Mutt. Nice place."
88,Jay Mataji,Hindu religious place.most important tourist place in Nashik. Especially the road side view. There are some breath taking view point on the way to temple.
89,Holy place,this devi temple in top of hills near saputara hill station very beautiful view from moutaine of down town .feeling blessed to be there..>jai mata di
90,Adobe of goddess,the temple is located on the top of the hill of Vani. it situated between the mountains. the surrounding is beautiful. the views during the road journey is so mesmerizing. well managed area. you have to park the vehicle at the bottom of the hill and go by bus. if the crowd is less then they can allow you to take your vehicle. a train service is provided to reach the temple. it costs 80rs. the has a big area having diff. type of foods and jewellery. the washrooms are clean.
91,spiritually charged place,"Had been to saptashrungi mandir 3-4 times, recently in june 14.one of the best spiritual experience is visiting this devi.you have to climb some 300-400 steps and when you enter the altar you see the amazing idol carved in the mountain.road is newly constructed and good but avoid driving at night.its better to start by 4-4.30 pm from nashik so you reach by 5.30 - 6 pm during summer and bit early in winteroverall i feel its a must visit for spiritual people as well as peace and mountain lovers"
92,Good for religious tour,"Wonderful place. At the hill top is one of the Shaktipeetha of India, Mata Saptashrungi. You can either climb the stairs or take a vehicle which costs Rs 90/- for return journey per person.There is a food court with lots of options. Earlier you reach here the better for you in terms of temperature. Visited the place in 4th week of July. So it was quite hot during the afternoon. Though you might hear there is a bus from Nasik in every 10 mins but that is not true. I missed one bus & the next one was after 1 & half hours. Being a solo traveller I didn't want to travel by a car alone. Fortunately met another family and together with some other people we came by a car. Attached is the photo of the number plate. Please do not travel by this car if you are travelling from Nasik by a car. Just to make sure we returned by the same car while returning to Nasik the driver & some locals misled us saying that we had to leave the shoes in the car as we would not be allowed anywhere near the temple premises with the shoes which was a complete lie. He parked the car at least 2 kilometres or more from the temple boundary. However after reaching the temple premises we found out that there are designated places for shoes to be kept. It was extremely hot and the road conditions are not at all walkable. As a result I burnt my feet and had other cut injuries. After returning when I asked the driver as to why he lied this gentleman along with other locals started fighting and the locals with sheer arrogance told me that ""it's our job to say all that"". Since I was travelling alone & by then injured my feet I was scared to say anything further. Friends everything else is fine in this place but please avoid this car for your safety & specially if you are travelling solo."
93,Holy place with beautiful mountain ranges ,"Shaktipeetam is what we liked? We need to climb around 350 steps. Do not buy either flowers or Saree for the deity. The are recycled through pandits and sales women. Do not park car with flower sellers , if you do not buy , they will be rude and ask you to remove your car."
94,Temple,"i DID not know whether I would really climb this 500 and odd steps to see the Temple. I was really scared till about 200 steps and bravely went  upto the temple. Believe me IT WAS WORTH IT. I  enjoyed every moment at the temple. There is shade all through and you can just sit relax and then proceed. Once you reach the temple and see the Goddess, so beautiful and nice, you will forget your tiredness. It is so calm and cool inside, just relax for sometime after the darshan and then proceed to climb down. The construction work is going on and there is a deviation and but no problem.    The temple also has the facility for food and water. It costs about Rs' 14/ and there is sumptuous and tasty meal and do not miss to have lunch here.   Also many shops selling pooja articles, photos, prasadams and many more things. take your time and buy items if you want to. There is a long drive on the hills to reach the bottom of the temple.which is on seven hills. The drive itself is so pretty and enjoyable, one feels very relaxed and happy.    The Garbagruh has the statue of Goddess and pooja is performed through the day.Do take some water while you climbing the steps.   Arrangements are being made for the ropeway facility, Once ropeway starts functioning many more aged and old devotees will have easy access to see the goddess and take darshan of Maa Bhagavathi and offer pooja."
95,Three and half Shakti Peethas Saptashrungi,Great pilgrimage to mataji temple. There is tram that helps anyone who cannot climb via thd 510 steps to the temple. Allow 2 to 3 hours at least.
96,Saptashrungi,"Saptashrungi temple has got a facelift and that has made it a better pilgrimage site to visit. The drive to the temple is simply awesome and even more spectacular during rains.Temple has around 500 steps for one to reach the sancum sanctorum. The steps are now covered to avoid heat and rains. Hence the climb is leisurely. They do have doli services for someone who cant climb on their own. The temple would soon have a fully functional udan khatola (ropeway) for pilgrims to reach the top directly, its almost ready but not fully functional as yet.Worth a visit if your religious person"
97,Holy place of worship of Goddess Saptashrungi Devi.,Beautiful temple away from the city of Nashik. You need to drive long to reach to this temple. Beautiful drive on good road. Easy to reach to this holy place. You need to climb many stairs . Be Careful of monkeys. The view from temple is awesome.
98,Saptashringi darshan,"A must visit.550 stairs to climb.Scenic all around.They are very soon starting a rope way sort of thing.Monkey around. Take precaution.Parking is available at local shops, from where you have to purchase some stuff."
99,Saptashringi Mata Darshan,Awesome location Nasik. Natural beautiful location i love this place. I am try to visit again. Good hotel available here.
100,Maata ke darshan,"Visit if you like temples and ready for adventurous journey. Even though it is 60kms from Nashik city, roads are bad so it will take about 2 hours to reach the place, from there State Transport buses will take you to mountain top, and from there you have good 500 steps steep stairs to reach temple. Would suggest to do it first thing in a day and not after travel. So essentially you will have to make good 2 day trip."
101,Temple on a Hill,"This place is 3hrs away from Nashik. The ropeway for going to the top is nice. The ropeway is located in a small mall. After reaching up you may find it a bit crowded, but after all the line you will reach the temple. The temple is nice but they will not let you stop there for a minute also. I enjoyed visiting this place. (:"
102,Vani Mata Temple,Great temple with ancient and traditional value. must visit temple not only for spiritual reasons but also for nature of beauty.
103,Saptashrungi Temple,"Very Good Place. The Vani Saptshrungi Mata temple is very famous of Shaktipith in Maharashtra. I am going to Mata temple in Makar Sankranti festival, I am very happy to take darshan. Very much devotees Rush in Temple."
104,Perfect season and good activities by trust,"near to nashik, saptashringi temple is one of the gem hidden in mountains. The overall feel and climate is superb,stairs are not much but little steep. You will not feel tired due to the cool breeze moving around. At the base, there is big market for all the stuffs..temple renovation is taking place currently and it will be surely helpful to all the devotees. The overall feel is awesome.."
105,Awesome Drive. Good Temple.,This is at the top of the hill.They have made a train which can go right up but they have still not started it .This ride would be wonderful as the climb is steep
106,Fully Devotional Place,Excellent place to visit this temple whenever you have minimum 4 to 5 hours to spare from your Nashik Visit . Took OLA ride outstation for family to travel to/ from between Nashik to Satpashrungi & back . Roads are not up to the mark .  Took 1 hour 45 minutes to travel from Nashik to Saptashrungi considering  bad road condition. Took Rope way / cable car for going to temple otherwise option were around 510 steps. Very good option for having lunch ( six / seven shops are selling food items ). Took more than 75 minutes in queue at top considering New Year day ( Next day of Diwali ). Person should carry water bottles.
107,Such a great place to visit,"Saptashruni temple is located at Wani area and on the top of mountain. You can reach at the base of temple mountain by Car. From this point, either you have to take Steps or Ropeway car. Ropeway car cost you ₹90 for return journey. When we reach, there was no rush for Ropeway car. Ropeway car is very well maintained.At the temple, there was huge crowd and we took nearly 1-1.5 hours to take Darshan. Bit annoyed by pushing people.There is Food court and place to keep your foot ware at the base station of Ropeway.Apart from crowds, overall experience was Good"
108,amazing divine place,"Abode of Saptashrungi Devi. Very scenic place especially in the rains. The road to Saptashrungi pacsses through Nshik, Dindori, Vani. The road is very scenic from Vani onwards till Saptashrungi.  ."
109,Natural wonder,It's 60 km from Saputara. A good place surrounded by hills. Shop keeper provides vehicle parking free on buying prasad. You can reach to top by climbing 400 steps.
110,beauty,"This is the place , where any one want to spend whole day at religious place. Great surrounding, religious atmosphere. On top of that, llittle bit exrsice to reach at the top of the hill. Becasuse, statue of goddes(Saptashrungi mata) is at top of the hill. Once, you reached at the top, you will see scenic veiw. Always feel to visit again and again."
111,Mountains beauty,"The goddess is very divine and the place is full of monkeys, but they do not harm anyone. Visited 3 times earlier. In rainy season it feels heavenly."
112,Jai Mata Di - with a local twist,This sacred place used to be quite few years ago. But now it's very crowded. The local shops and mainly the parking providers are really annoying. The good thing it's made easy to climb the steps and reach to the goddess.
113,Jai mata di,"Whenever I move to any city I make sure that if there any “Shaktipeeth(a place for worshipp associated with goddess)” nearby. In june 2011 I got a chance to visit Nashik. After extensive research I came to know that approximate 60 km North of Nashik, there is a shaktipeeth of Devi named as “ Sapta-shrungi”.According to legend Once the demon Mahishasur acquired all the destructive powers and created havoc on the earth as well as heaven. Due to involvement of a boon it was not possible even for gods to kill him. As a result Lord Brahma.Vishnu and Mahesh combine their energies to manifest into goddess Amba. A fierce battle broke between Amba and Mahishasur.the demon transformed himself into a buffalo but finally Amba killed the demon at the place called Saptashrungi(means mountain of seven peaks). After that the goddess decided to resides on saptashrungi. At the foothills of saptashrungi hills there is idol of buffalo head signifies , the demon Mahishasur. The idol of goddess is more than 10 feet tall having 18 hands. The signification of 18 hands signifies the “Maha Shakti”, the divine power. The idol is fully covered with sindoor. My guide told me that there is a cave behind this idol where the goddess the present in the divine form that human eyes cant bear the glow.It is also believe that the sacred book of hindus “DeviMahatmayam” was written by Sage Markandey here. Since Sage Markandey is chiranjeevi(Long lived), still it is believe that he resides on the opposite hill where the goddess resides.I followed the route  from Nashik and drive to   the Dindori road (NH 17) . After crossing the Nanduri village the landscaping changes into very beautiful hilly area. The temple is situated in a village vani at the height of 1250m above sea level. There is a motorable road upto an altitude of 1140 m. From here there is a steep climb of 500 steps which could be cover easily in forty minutes. The offerings has to be purchases before the climb. It is custom to burn the camphor (in multiples of 9 ) at the huge entrance. It is believe that there are numerous kunds(holy ponds) in this area. Also this area is enriched with plants and herbs which has a lot of medicinal value..I began the journey about 10 am. I reached at the foothill around noon. it took almost 40 minutes to climb 500 steps."
114,Jai Mata Di ,A good place with 360 degree scenic beauty filled with thrill. The place is really charming immediately after the rainy season.
115,Feel blessed with awesome view,Also known as Vani Devi ... Mata is blessed with the powers to bless you with your muraad being fulfilled. Well located thru a scenic drive from Nasik towards Saputara...turn Right before 35 kms approx. Cloudy mountains & hillside with lots of greenery during monsoon and a good time naturally during winter. The stairs going up to behold the Darshan of Mata are well covered overhead for the devotees protection from direct sun ...with resting places in between. Coming down is a sweet feeling of fulfillment.
116,I cool and clam place.,On the Saputara Nashik road 25 kms from Vani town. The drive is pleasing. Perched on a hilltop and mostly at a height higher than Saputara this is worth a visit. A typical temple setup with commercial activities at the foot of the temple.
117,Place of workship near Nashik,Nice but very nice when its raining. It's 35 KM from nasik road on hills good for photos shoots. Must see
118,Nice spot,Little far from nashik about 2 hrs journey. Temple on hill top .Beware of monkeys.Do not forget to take sweets from local market as taste is like Grandmother's peda. Cable car is not started yet.
119,A neat temple,You will never forget the charm of Godess Saptshrungi ...this one of the most worship godess temple in the state  of maharashtra..now the development of the tourist destination has started you can enjoy more comfort at the location. ..
120,Shaktipeeth temple on the hill,"Need to take buses to reach till the base of the temple, private cars are not allowed. The bus service is good and frequent, although the buses are rickety. The climb to the temple would take almost 2 hours given the crowd/ queue. Advisable to carry water bottles along and refill it along the way. Plenty of eateries for simple food."
121,Religious and energising tour,"It was only 90min journey from Nasik Panchavati area by car, towards Vani. Magnificent view of Markendeya hill at Ajanta-Satmal range of Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra. Cable car option with 90/- per adult ( below 15 yrs half ticket) is solution for those who has trouble to ride 500 steps. Eighteen handed mata Bhagawati about 10ft height, smeared with saffron sindoor demands awe and attraction both especially for large eyes. Green saree is must in puja dala offering. Camera not allowed within main temple. It is told that right hand remains of mata sati has fallen at this place. Nice experience, all are in Hindu faith travelling around Nasik must include the place in trip agenda."
122,Divine,It is around 75 km from Nasik Road Railway Station. This place is the Shaktipeeth and the temple is located on the hill. This offers stunning views from the top. It is I can say a must go place if you are going to Nasik. You can also get Mahaprasad (food) for 15 rs only. You can also enjoy Kandi Peda here.
123,A day at Holy Place (Saptashrungi Gadh).,"Good time to visit from July to October for lovely weather.It is famous temple and peoplke worship godesses and belief is she is poerful deity.Around Navratri time and in the Feb/March there is a big festival(Mela) ,thousands of people visit temple"
124,Excellent temple,"We have visited the Saptashringi Mata temple from Nanduri gad in the month of September 2017. The location is on the top of seven hills and the climate during September is very scenic. There is lust green surrounding with fresh air and clouds in between. There were lot of devotees with loud chores of ""Saptashringi Mata ki jay!"" You can go upto the base of the temple with your vehicle or by bus. Private cars are also available. The whole journey is is through ghat till base. From the base till Mata temple there are about 550 steps. After climbing the steps you can take the darshan of ""Saptashringi Mata."" There is lot fulfillment after having darshan of mata. You feel the power and enrichment. The cable car 🚡 work is in final stage. After that, the only thing ""Saptashringi mata darshan""  will is more suitable for all devotees,especially to Senior citizens and kids as well. "" Jay Mata Di ""🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏"
125,Saptashringi gad,One of the must places to visit if you go to Nashik. Around 55 kms away . Takes close to two hours to reach.  Beautiful temple on the hilltop.  Temple food is available at nominal rates .  It is a bit spicy but very good taste.
126,amaging place devsthan,"Combined a trip to this place with a trip to Trimbakeshwar. Drove to this place from Trimbakeshwar -it is about 93 kms, took us about 2.5 hours. Started at about 8:00 in the morning and reached at about 10:30 AM - traffic was rather high.Very good roads, except in short stretches of bad surface. Parking - plenty, provided by locals in sheds. They do not charge for parking if you buy puja material from them.The climb up to the temple is about 450 steps. Took us about 20 minutes or so the climb. not a very difficult climb. For the senior citizens / disabled, they have what is called doli - a chair fitted on a couple of bamboos and carried by 2- 4 guys. They charge Rs 500.For senior citizens, the entry to the temple is direct, one does not have to wait in the queue. We had visited the temple on a Sunday - as we had gone with senior citizens, we could enter the temple directly, without having to wait. Even if we had to wait, it would have probably taken 15 - 25 minutes maximum.Quite a few stall in the approach to the temple stairs - selling everything from food to puja material. Good experience."
127,Saptashrungi Mountainous Range,Do visit this place to feel blessed on top of the hill also if your are planning to visit hill station than i must say you can choose this place .. apart from this place beauty plz don't eat food local restaurant because its worst quality and no taste rather visit mall from ropeway area or saptashrungi dinning area which has delicious food on very low rate and also trust guesthouse is better option to stay
128,One of the most worshipped temple,Awesome place to visit for saptshrungi gad also know as wani or gad its a historical place of god navdurga kali ka mata and all other 7 devis over there it is hardly loveable spot for hindus.. u can visit over here for full year 24/7 but after its having timing too after evening 5pm u cant go over there till mrng 4 am...i having scientiifc time just to avoid incidnce like accident and all awesome place but not for shopping its costly for you all
129,Sapthashrungi Awesome Place,We can take car up to foot hill roads are good - avoide night travel since ghat section is fairly steepThen there are steps or Doli or Winch for going up for Dharshan .R

132,Nice place,"It is one of the Shakti Pith in Maharashtra, about 60 kms from Nasik, good hilly area, and pleasant climate, car can reach upto hill top, we have to climb approx 300+ steps, now a days ropeway is also operational, good spiritual place to visit near Nasik"
133,Jai mata satashrungi,Being a local i have been coming regularly here. Best time to visit is monsoon season when clouds takeover the whole area and temple view is above the clouds. There are quite a lot of stairs to be climbed for reaching to temple. Adventuros ppl can take their own climbing way to reach the stairs on top and climate is quite cool making the place perfeft.
134,Family Trip,It is basically temple of Goddess. You will need to climb at-least 100+ steps to reach the temple. They have made facility to go up and come down separately. It is generally crowded by devotees. Not a very clean place upto temple. Monkeys at the temple are bothersome. But darshan of goddess makes it all worth it.
135,avoid in summers,Nice place and arrangements for the visitors. Direct transport to the temple is available from Nashik old CBS.
136,Too risky to go when crowded,This temple is at the top of the hill and the goddess Saptashrungi is powerful. The climb up the hill was a refreshing experience by itself. Vinch and Rope car are also available for the aged. The scenic view from the top is something I relished a lot.
137,Historics place with Mythological Importance.,"Commonly referred as Vani mata temple, this place is approximately 2 hours drive from Nashik. Located atop a hill feature, it provides a very beautiful view to the visitors"
138,The goddess beckons on the mountain.,This temple considered to be holiest of mother Goddess is atop a hill called Saptashrungi ie seven peaks. Very well managed ..an excellent ropeway  and also nice arrangements.Especially scenic during good monsoon. Must visit.
139,TEMPLE ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN,"One of the best place to visit in nasikk!  Feel the nature and spiritual at one place. Best to visit in rainy season. Cloud around your car or bike during awesome road trip up to temple. Small waterfall in road.  If like to eat fish then Ozarkhed is the place 10 km away from vani, in Nasik ani road. It's actually dam."
140,The Weekend Wonder,This place is located in Vani. This temple is of Devi saptashrungi. It is located on the top of the hill.
141,Holy Shrine,"The hike is totally worth it! Lovely idol and yes a breathtaking view from the temple! If you go during the rains, you will get the best view. But yes need to be careful while driving through the cloudy roads!"
142,Nice experience,"Constantly visiting this place during April - May month. Approximately 65-70 Kms from CBS Nashik. You need to take bus of MSRTC from CBS, Nashik. Fare is 80-100Rs for adult. Also, returning buses from Saptshrungi Gad to Nashik are also available frequently. Crowd management is not goodenough. It has Elevator facility for handicapped and elder people. Nice place to visit with family. Always feeling blessed when visited Saptashrungi Gad at Vani."
143,Jai Mada Di,"travelling by bus when you watch how your  vehicle going  with mountain you got enjoy.  the idle of Devi give us peace of heart,the story of this place also attract you.please if are go  in the winter must go at night.the starful sky and  the light ohf the bottom town. it's wonderful scene."
144,Jai mata di,Till about last six months climbing Saptashrungi  gad was not possible for aged people but now even a disabled person can go and take Darshan of the goddess because of the rope trolly installed. The arrangment cleanliness is extra ordinary.Like Singapore when you come down you will find a cleanly maintained food court where you will get good vegetarian food of your choice.
145,Good darshan amidst a scary crowd,Saptashrungi is located at Satpur Gangapur Road in Nashik. so much greenary is there. it is a temple of the goddess Saptashrungi Nivasin is also the half 'Shaktipeeth' of the three and a half Shaktipeeths located in Maharashtra.
146,DONT AFFORD TO MISS IT,Easy to reach.Very holy place.Almost all facilities available.One day family tour can be arranged.you will get full peace of mind.
147,Goddess of Seven Hills,"We have visited Saptashrungi Temple in end may, it has best view of waterfall from mountains in monsoon. There are private car parking they charge 100-150 rs. Makes sure temple is very crowded on Tuesdays and Fridays, long standing que. but once you get darshan you feel blessed. Not advisable to stand in que with small kids as once you get in que you can not get out from it. You can make donations at temples's office and get receipt and prasad.You will find snacks shops try for palak bhaji kanda bhaji. There is also temple's own prasadi where they serve chapati rice dal shira at minimal price of 15 rs it is well maintained clean and hygiene.Overall wonderful experience."
148,Beutiful Place,"The people who have visited Vaishnao Devi, the climb to this shrine may look simple, but for us it was no less. We had visited this place sheer out of chance, since we were traveling to Nashik from Saputara during monsoon. The entire mountain was engulfed in the cloud, so we could not guess the height that we had to climb. We started the climb and we reached the temple and came back after darshan... i attribute all this to Mata who had given us enough energy and will power to be there at he feet. The climb as well as the scenery from top is breath taking. I suggest to all Mata devotees to visit this place."
149,Jai Mata Di,One of the three 'Shakti peeths' in Maharashtra. Scenic location and good infrastructure. Travel in recommended only for the faithful.
150,Best tourist spot  and pilgrim ,Till now it used to be herculean task particularly for elders to climb tough 500+ steps to pray the goddess. . The only option for them was laborers lifting manually. However introduction of funicular  recently has changed scenario. Probably it is first time in India that this has been introduced. Pleasant surprise is cleanliness to its surrounding and taking utmost care of the pilgrims. The entire area around and the funicular itself is no less than the best and comparable to international standard. food courts with multiple choice is available.Must visit.
151,Navratri Celibrations 2016,Great place on the outskirts of Nashik. Excellent for an enjoyable day trip. Go for the scenic location and the exotic surroundings.
152,Adventurous,"do visit the holy shrine @ any time whenever i feel sad or lonely i just get my car out & visit the place its one of the most peaceful place of divine & the huge idol of mata raani is most beautiful of them all its half shatipith called by maharastrians tht symbolizes the power of durga , kali & saraswati  be there with family or friends u,ll never get disappointed"
153,Jay mata di,"The whole place is mesmerising on top of the mountain .. you need to climb hundreds of steps to reach the temple, but its totally worth the climb. very peaceful and serene .."
154,JAY MATAJI....,"We reached the foothill of saptashrungi garh in the afternoon (very hot), where shaded car parking was available for a small sum. We then proceeded to the ropeway which was 2 minutes walking distance and bought the tickets which cost us 90rs per person. Wheelchair facilities are available for old people. We reached the top within a minute. Devi sarshan in the cave was amazing. There are a number of monkeys around the temple. We then got to know u could also walk up to the cave via steps...entrance of that is about 10km before the ropeway.On the way back via the same ropeway we bought amazing malai pedhas.The roads to the garh are lovely. Plan to go again in the monsoons."
155,Spiritual place of Hindus,"The temple is one of the three and half ""Shakti Peeth"" of goddess durga. It is on a hiltop. Have to walk the staircases. Good place to visit along with Nashik Kumbh Mela."
156,Best temple to visit Near Nashik,we went to pray to the devi. The steps are quite steep but it was refreshing to climb it. feels good
157,"Jai Ambe Maa, Jai Bhavani Maa",This was my another visit to Saptshringi and this time we used Cable car it made our visit so easy. Parking and Nearby area is well developed and spacious. There are Shops which sells fancy Items as well. makes Sure you buy everything for Pooja before you board a Cable car. Restaurant in Basement serves good variety of food and You can complete entire to and fro Journey in 1 to 1.5 Hours.
158,Jai ma Saptashrungi,"The vehicle does go upto some distance till the temple.Then at the base we have numerous shops/restaurants,etc.There are steps which can be taken to reach the temple (with a shed overhead), also the have stared a cable car (minus the cable) sort of thing for a direct reach (in of the pics uploaded by me).Climbing the steps is easy, don't just give up.There are monkeys at the top so keep your belongings safe.The queues are not too long.The views from the top, and on the way are amazing.The is sort of natural magneting rock while coming down, where people stick coins.The shivling sort of picture, is the view from the top and not the actual temple.Must visit if u are in Nashik.Keep 4-5 hrs for this spot."
159,Very beautiful place,"Saptashrungi or Saptashringi is a holy shrine found on a mountain situated at Nanduri, Kalwan taluka, which is a tiny village at about 60 kms from the city of Nasik in the state of Maharashtra in India. The sacred script Devi Bhagavatha describes Mother Goddess Sree Lalitha as a dweller at Saptashrungi, meaning thereby that Goddess of all gods stays at seven hills called Saptashrungi. The Sanskrit term ‘Sapta’ means seven and ‘shrung’ means hills. It is said that it is one of the ""three Shakti Peetas"" in Maharashtra and one of the 51 Shakti Peetas.  This is where Sati's (first wife of Lord Shiva) right arm had fallen after Daksha yagna.Three are four most famous temple dedicated to Mother goddess in different names in Maharashtra. They are 1) Mahalakshmi Temple at Kolhapur, 2) Tulja Bhavani Temple at Tuljapur, 3) Renuka Temple at Mahur (Matripur) and 4) Saptashrungi Temple at Vani. Fortunately I have visited them repeatedly. These four temples are attributed to symbolize the four aspects of sacred OM=AUM, A for Akara, U for Ukara, Ma for Makara and Mmm for Mmkara called Ardha matra. Saptashrungi giri is a portion in the epic famous Dandakaranya in Ramayana. Rama, Seetha, and Lakshman visited this temple to offer prayers to Mother Goddess here. In the other mountain, on the east of this hill, sage Markandeya lived in a cave. Saptashrungi Temple consists of a two storied structure and the idol of the goddess is seen in the summit story. As I saw the idol appears to have been carved on the rock in a cave. However the priests say that Devi is swayambhu (means self-manifested). There are 18 arms in the 8’ tall idol dressed in saffron colour. When I saw the idol was painted in bright red with ochre called sindoor. Sindoor  is an auspicious thing. Her eyes were white shining brightly. You can see the trident or Trishula decorated with bells and lamps fixed in the courtyard in front of the temple.There are about 500 steps from top to road end.  There are community halls, a gallery for devotees to form queues to have darshan of the goddess conveniently. Devotees visit this shrine in huge numbers every day. Buses are available to reach the temple precincts. Among many important festivals ""the Chaitra festival"" is most popular occasion. The festival begins from Rama Navami (the ninth lunar day in the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Chaitra) and ends on Chaitra Poornima (full moon day), which is said to be the major festival. The childless women who have taken vows attend this festival to beget children by the grace of the Mother Goddess and many have been successful in getting the fruits of their sincere prayer. Millions of devotees gather here on such occasion every year.The pilgrims from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and many other parts of the country would be present to offer their prayers to the deity. Some of the Bhakthas (devotees) prefer to walk all the way from Nasik (60 km) to the shrine. It is customarily religious for Hindus to go round the main deity in a temple in clockwise direction thrice or atleast once as a part of the offering prayers. But here the image of the goddess is inscribed on the rock itself as such the devotees have to go round the mountain itself to fulfill their vow of doing pradakshina. I was told that many devotees often circumambulate (do pradakshina) the entire mountain area. The formal procedure of offering coconuts, silk cloth, Sari and Choli (blouse), sandal sticks along with Harisina and kum-kum have been in vogue in this temple.There are about 108 water reservoirs on the hill, known as Kundas. The road leading to the mountain top is vehicle worthy that takes us to an altitude of 1150 meters. From this place we have to climb about 500 steps to reach the shrine. But for those who cannot climb these steps due to advanced age or health reason they may use the services of “dollies” readily available on the spot itself. There is a ropeway, which is used only for carrying goods, but I don’t know whether it is available for passengers. There is a lodging house called Bhakta Niwas and hotels and lodges. The Saptashrungi temple is located at Vani at 60kms from Nasik. It is connected to the major cities of Maharashtra by road and can be approached by many routes.  There are roads via which vehicles can take visitors to an altitude of 1150m and thereafter pilgrims have to proceed on 500 steps to reach the temple. The nearest airport to the Saptashrungi is in Nasik and the nearest railway station is also at Nasik.Better plan to visit this shrine between November and March when the weather will be pleasant and not too cold or very hot. You may find accommodation in Nasik, where you have number of budget and luxury hotels."
160,Peaceful place,This is a ancient temple of Devi. Myth says Durga Saptashi was written here by Markandey Rishi. This on lap mountains. The way to this temple is full of enjoy and rich in natural view.
161,Spiritual Holy Temple,It is said that Mata Sati's right arm had fallen her and Her presence can be felt here for sure. Maa manifested and appeared within the wall of this cave and there is a beautiful radiance within the temple. Energetic men will carry you up the steep stairs to the top in a doli for Rs700 and return you to the bottom even more speedily after you have done your darshan. The views all around are breathtaking and one can get beautiful photos of the lovely scenery on your way up.

164,Nice holy place,I visited on 26 Dec 2015. You must stay at saptshungi bhakt nivas.  Because  you can attend maha puja  which is perform on every day 7 am. Toak nos of staircases 450 and it will take 30 min. Ropeway lift work is under construction and will be completed in 2016. Meal or mahaprasad at bhakt nivas is excellent.  VIP rate 50 per person and normal is 15 per person.  If you want ware saree to devi then book from phone. Office phone no is 02592253351.Mandir is very good and darshan facilties are excellent.
165,“Very good place must visit”,"Wonderful visit. Return Ticket for ropeway was Rs 90/--  discount was there for my mother.Wheel chair facility was available but did not require one as there was a lift taking us to the upper level.Capacity of the vehicle is 60. We were very lucky to have the carriage  ride with only 18 persons on board.At the upper level also lifts were available.Persons on duty were extremely helpful.It took hardly 1 minute by the carriage to reach the top.Place adjacent to the shrine was slippery.Monkeys are always alert. Suddenly noticed one of them tearing my packet of offerings and before I could react , it took away everything except the coconut.May be it was not interested in making the extra effort associated with coconut eating.On our return the carriage was full.Different kinds of sweets were  on sale.Their quality was really good."
166,very good place,"The location is so good that even a non-follower of Saptashrungi devi would like to visit. One has to climb approx. 500 steps to reach the destination. Doli facility is available for Rs.700 per person. Weather is awesome and so is the temple. Stay facility is available for as low as Rs.500 per night. The accommodation offered by Trust is not that good, but the food is very tasty and economical."
167,nice holy place.,The natural beauty surrounding the main saptshringi temple.Just experience the scenic beauty and ignore the chaos at the foothill of the main mountain.
168,Amazing,Really hot and humid in summer otherwise good religious place. Approx 80 stairs to climb .parking difficulties on weekends.
169,Blessings of devi,"I owe our visit to Saptashrungi just due to the newly built funicular trolley. This fantastic service has just been commenced in 1st week of July'18. There are 6 compartments and can accommodate 10 persons in each. So total 60 persons can be transported in one trip of about 3 minutes. Some steps have to be climbed - say about 20, but that's ok as there is no fear of slipping down. The trolley service starts at 9 am and ends by 6.30 pm. The ticket is 80/- per person for a return trip. In case one wishes to avail wheel chair assistance that is charged at 140/- per return trip. This is the first in India and worth all appreciation. The building/station is spacious with clean restrooms, eateries, waiting rooms and first aid assistance. The staff managing the service were courteous and provided the information readily. For super senior citizens above 75 and children below 12, the fare is 40/-The road up hill is good and the scenery is beautiful. The temple has a menace of monkeys who grab any bag containing eatables - they are all around - on the ground and up on the bars. One has to walk with extra care trying to dodge them and minding the sticky and wet floor in the internal temple area.Thanks to this new Trolley, a large number of senior persons, families with young children and the disabled getn opportunity to visit the Goddess shrine."
170,pray pray to the devi sati atop the mountain,"Sapsthrungi located 65 Km from Nashik and is best to visit during monsoon for its ghat region. There are steps constructed to climb the temple and is a very well established pilgrimage spot with a good number of lodges located on top.If you are trekker at heart, you will be tempted to visit the peak opposite this temple- Markandeya. Its a one day trek to Markandeya and back. The view is equally mesmerizing. From the valley point you can spot another trekking point- Dhodap and there are further trekking points nearby. One can also do ""pradakshina"" around the Saptashringi mountain to see the beautiful view around the place."
171,Very good place,The steps to the temple are a bit steep and tough to climb but the construction above the hill is pretty good and worth seeing.....a good spot to visit while going to Nashik from Gujarat border.
172,Breathtaking!,"Saptashrungi, a Hindu pilgrimage is located around 70 km from Nashik.The temple is situated at 4700 feet above sea level, on a hill surrounded by seven peaks with forests loaded with medicinal herbs. It is considered to be Ardha Shaktipeeth out of  3.1/2  Shakti Peeths in Maharashtra. The figure of the goddess ( belived to be Swayambhu )  is about eight feet high, carved in the natural rock . She has eighteen hands , each hand grasping a different weapons  It is believed that one of the limbs of the right arm of Sati (Lord Shiva's wife) fell here.. Saptashringa Gad is a place where Goddess Bhagawati dwells.To reach the top of the temple, one needs to take either 500 steps or, a ropeway which takes around 2 minutes and costs INR 90 Per person for adults and INR 45 for children. The trip with rope-way trolley is worth enjoying. At the base there are shops & canteen selling handicrafts, Puja Samagri & eatables. During special festivals like Navratri and Poornima, the temple offers free food to its devotees. On regular days, the Laddu Prasad is available on nominal payment.The morning & evening Aarti in temple is something one should not miss , as you are simply out of this world during this period."
173,Temple on hill,The best time to visit the place is in the months of rainy season because all over the green looks much attractive.Huge number of upstairs makes you fatigue but the idol of goddess make it worth.Old age peoples have the alternative for upstairs but you have to pay for this.The goddess of saptashrungi is the incarnation of adi shakti.
174,A PLACE FOR A PERSON HAVING LOVE FOR HILLS HISTORY AND RELIGION,"Excellent temple of Mata saptashringi devi. One of shaktipeeth of nasik, very good viabration of temple as well as atmosphere is also excellent. As a hill station."
175,"Saptashrungi Temple, Vani",The best time to visit is just when rainy season starts or is ending. the views are amazing the greenery is great. The temple is obviously what the name stands for. You need to climb a bit but its not hard. Overall its fun
176,Super Sight,"Went to Vani via Nashik, Trip was made easy because of rope way. Good arrangement and cleanliness. Highly recommended."
177,Awesome weather coupled with blessings,Traversing through the hills and vineyards the road takes you this shakti-pitha.A walk high-up the hill will take you to this temple.The view from here is worth the pain of climbing.
178,Divine Temple.,It took about 2 hours by car from Nashik.Through the greenery and the last mile was a great hill climb.Incredible scenery of the uniquely shaped divine hills.Peaceful yet colourful atmospheric of the sacred temple.Hundreds of the step climb to the temple is tough but still worth it.I would visit here again and again.
179,Pilgrimage,Religious place with modern ropeway.it is 22 km from vani tehsil which is 55 km from nasik.frequent jeep available from here .Charged 50 rs. From one side.hilly view is fantastic in rainy season.temple is at good height.ropeway charge rs. 90 for both sides and 45 for child
180,A divine feeling,"Saptashrungi is situated near Nashik. The main shrine is situated on the hill top. The view from the hill top is spectacular. One can reach the temple by car or any other public transport. Then, to reach the main shrine, there are two ways. You can either climb up the stairs or travel in the funicular trolley. We took a ride in the funicular trolley. It took only 2 minutes to reach the main shrine. It was a new experience. Even the travelling cost was worthy. There are many shops and eateries in the temple"
181,Divine Tour,"Simply awesome place , scenic view on the way to temple. very nice view from the temple. take care if going with children as approx. 700 stairs to reach to temple"
182,Excellent,"This temple s 63 KM from Nashik,  which is on Hill top. There are MSRTC buses available from Nashik. If you have car, blindly follow Google map. You will reach easily. You need to climb around 600 steps to reach the temple from the base.  Do not for get see the Mahishasura statue/head (at the base/entrance of the path, where Goddess killed Mahishasura).It is not much difficulty to reach the temple through steps. But 'Doli'  is available for an amount of RS.700/-. I can see some Train/ Rope way was in construction. May be it takes another 1 year to finish. But not sure whether this is for general public or for goods.There is one Mahadev mandir (on hill base village) which you can see from hill top. Worth to visit. May be half KM from base.There are lots of shops when reaching temple, who force you to keep your chappal for free, instead they force you to buy flowers. You can leave the chappal at chappal stand (left side of hill entrance). Also, there is lots of empty parking available. Do not part your vehicle when some one asked to keep. Again they force you to buy, puja material."
183,Religious as well as Adventures place to visit.,"Saptashrungi temple is located at Vani about 120 kms to the north of Nasik. located near  Gujarat border.  very popular among devotees , surrounded by hills"
184,Feel th Nature and spiritual.,"Saptashrungi Temple is a site of Hindu pilgrimage situated 60 kilometres from Nashik. According to traditions, the goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini dwells within the seven mountain peaks. (Sapta means seven and shrung means peaks.) It is located in Vani, a small village.Devotees visit this place in large numbers every day.Our first visit to Saptashrungi temple was very memorable. We read in Sai Satcharitra about this temple and planning a visit for very long time.Finally we received blessings from Shirdi Baba this time around! It is also said that when the demon king Mahishasura was creating havoc in the forests, the  devas and people urged Durga to kill the demon. Then the 18 armed Saptashrungi Devi took the form of Durga and slayed Mahishasura, and since then she is also known as Mahishasura Mardhini. Mahishasura was in the form of a buffalo. At the foot of the hill, from where one starts climbing the steps, there is the head of a buffalo, made in stone, which is believed to be of demon Mahishasura.When we reached the foot of the hill we were taken aback as we had to climb another 500 steps by foot in order to reach the temple. Guidance from Baba provided us the determination and strength to climb the steps in 30 minutes and our return was even faster."
185,Visit to Saptashrungi temple ,"On the way from Nashik to this place,  you will have amazing spots to stop by in between - at dam, at waterfall and just at a corner of hills. The temple has 500 stairs but can easily climb (even if you are a kid or an old) .  Though they are also in process of staying a  escalator train. Ths view is maintained so that you can see the goddess even while in que and hence the usual complain at various temples of having. Very less view of god is avoided. Very good quality food is provided by trust at just 50 rupees."
186,Jai mata sapashrungi,"Suptashrungi Devi one of 51 shaktipeeth of Maa Parvati, amazing Place to visit and you can trek to markandeya hill right in front of suptashrungi hill. Suptashrungi Trust has category to stay 1) basic rooms was pathetic 2)Neat and Clean rooms without AC.Overall experience was A W E S O M E"
187,Saptashrungi Devi - Sahtipeeth Darshan,"Saptashrungi is a hill range situated 60 km from Nashik and 48.2 km (via NH360) from Saputara. The temple is open to devotees from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day, including public holidays and does not charge any entrance fee. The nearest railway station to Saptashrungi is the Nashik Railway Station. The Maharashtra State Transport Corporation (MSTC) runs regular bus service to the temple vicinity.A regular work train service has been started directly to the Saptashrungi temple. The temple and vicinity premises has been well managed and well maintained by the authorities there.For people who have a private vehicle, avoid parking in the outside stalls as their charges are exorbitant and it is crowded, ill-managed and touts all around. Parking is a hassle. Park at the private parking besides the winch ticket window.Plenty of monkeys the moment you enter the sanctum, *be warned*.Do not buy anything from the small shops at the base which will just burn a hole in your wallet.Alas, another beautiful untouched place which is now a commercial hub!"
188,A mix of experiences,"visited on 26th dec 18 wednesday with family in personal car....selected wednesday as assuming less rush compare to sat sundays or tuesday / friday of pick day's.Road condition -started from Nasik. Within Nasik city road condition is good. More patches are there from Nashik mhasarul to vani village. No divider on same road approx 40km. Most worst condition of road in vani village.almost its kachha road. After vanish village the main tample distance is around 20km including Ghat. Road and ghat is in better condition after vanish village to main temple.Trolly ride-- nice experience, costly tickets compare to ride time. It takes hardly 4/5min.Prasadalay- need to increase food quality and cost also. Can Ref Shirdi prasadalay food. Main building, parking is better."
189,Must visited temple,"This place is around 70 km from Nashik. MSRTC buses are available but the frequency seem to be low. You can take shared jeep. As they try to accommodate 16 to 17 people it will not be very comfortable. Takes around 2 to 2.5 hrs to reach the Saptshrungi Gadh. You can take ropeway or take the stairs. Fare for rope way is 90 rs to and fro. By steps it is approx 450 steps. Wouldnt call it as ropeway , it is like a train compartment going up and down the hill unlike the rope way. Be ware of the monkeys. Once you have darshan and return there are few restaurants in the premises"
190,Worth a visit. Spiritual experience,"This is one of Saktipitha in India, Maharastra. Its 60KM from Nasik. You can get private cab to reach this place and temple is open all day 6AM to 6 PM. This temple is located on the hill you have to walk 510steps, not that much hard max take 30 mins to reach. Temple surrounding is very nice, you cant find good restaurants near temple so have food from Nasik, yes prasad seven is there from temple trust you can have that but before 2PM."
191,Hindu Temple ,About an hour drive from Nashik takes you to Vani. You pass through a 9 - 10 km ghat en-route. The temple is located on a hill and you have to climb around 500+ steps.
192,Amazing.. a temple on top of the world,"This is very nice tample of adi shakati Saptshrungi mata, located in Vani, 60-70 KM from nashik.This temple is situated in the hill range & is a very nice one because we feel like going to hill station.So don't miss going there when you are around Nashik. As per hind puran this is half sakti pith."
193,Wonderful temple!!,"An excellent place to visit. Ride to this place is awesome. It would take approx. 1.5 hours from Nashik. Temple it at hill top and have to go through lot of curves. At top you need to climb atleast 500 steps. For sr. citizen palki is available but at some cost. Ropeway work is under process and I believe it will start within 6 months.Samll temple but after darshan of God you forget all pain. Lot of monkey at the top. Does not disturb people but tries to snatch Prasad or food or water in decent way, so better to hide them and enter temple.Local people have made car ample car shades and you can park your car there at Rs.50, if you wish."
194,Temple at a hill top,"The Saptashrungi devi is one of the 3-1/2 shakti peeths which was pending as we had already covered the 3 shakti peeths . The temple is situated on a mountain and has around 500 steps to reach the santum sanctorum. The climb is steep and very ardourous. Once you reach the main garba gruh all your tiredness vanishes within seconds. One look at the devi with 7 arms and big wide eyes and you feel the journey is worth the climb. From Nashik it takes 2 hrs to reach the temple, the ghat is mesmerizing with the twists and turns and it is a treat if one loves driving. There is a provision being made available in the form of cable car but yet to be commissioned. Beware of the monkeys who could snatch things from your hands. I only wish that the devotees maintain the sanctity of the temple by patiently lining in the queue instead of shoving and pushing."
195,Superb!,"A wonder of bliss in the rains and waterfalls dancing through this hillock is a mind boggling event, must experience once in a lifetime"
196,Divine,"Being raised in Nashik, I have been to the Saptashrungi temple many times. Couple of times have stayed on top of the garh as well. This is a truly divine place. The whole environment so pleasant. Climbing 500 stairs can be fun if you are in a group with your family and friends, but as you reach the temple, you feel the relief and sense of fulfillment. You should certainly visit the temple atleast once if you are travelling to Nashik. Overall it take about a day 6-8 hours if you are travelling by bus from Nashik. There are many buses from Central bus stand they take you near the foothill and from there you can take the local jeeps on the Ghat. Just one tip - stay clear of the monkeys :) they can be notorious, but you will enjoy their presence all over the place."
197,Very nice place to visit,The ST bus station is just at the foot of mountain and plenty of other transport facilities are available. One can hire a vehicle from Nasik if you are in a group. There are just OK food facilities around. Climbing 500 steps for those who can or else rope-way is being commissioned shortly. Going to the top gives a good view of mountainous range.
198,Saptashrungi Devi Temple,"You have a wonderful drive up 17 Km to temple with a good view. Enjoy the steep hair-pin bend. The Climb of 450 Steps to Saptashrungi maata temple is forgotten, once you view the scene from top. The Markendeya Hill accross the valley is too inviting. Do visit Shiva Temple and Lake thereby. Alas, the work on Funicular trolley is progressing too slowly."
199,Awesome Trip,"This is a great place, one of the best things to do. You will enjoy your driving while going towards the point. Scenic beauty is awesome. The temple is really good."
200,Great place,This might come in your way. Beautiful view. Do capture it. Nothing much to do here. We spent 10 mins here.
201,A quick religious outing for a holiday...,"I visited this place for the first time, it was nice experience. Try to visit in weekdays instead of weekends. Otherwise this place gets overcrowded.Have steps to reach at top, so be prepare for steps walking, which makes little uncomfirtable. Do not carry too much bags or weight with you during walk.Beware of moneys in surrounding area.cable car is open for public, construction and testing is still going on.Best days to visit this place is in rain, have some good view during jorney.If you planning to visit this palce in advance then try to go early in the morning so that you can cover saputara which is nearby hill station. You can cover both place in a day. Road is in good condition for that you can go by own vehicle."
202,I Love visiting this tample,"One needs to climb atleast 500 steps to get to the main sanctum. For physically challenged and senior citizens one can avail the facility of palkhi, which is reasonably priced"
203,Must Visit,"Adventurous & Religious. Beautiful scenery's along the way. Monsoon & winter, July to December, is the best time to visit.."
204,Religious and adventurous trip always,Went with family.......nice scenery.......pleasent environment.....transport facility is also good so theres no problem to reach that place.....
205,"Must visit,one of 51 Shakti Peeths in India",sapthashringi is a temple on the hills dedicated to goddess Durga. it is closer to Nasik in Maharashtra and also to Saputara hill station in Gujarat. over the years the place has been developed with better amenities.
206,pilgrimage,"Vani Devi as it is popularly known is around 70 Kms from nashik, Visited during Navratri, hence need to park your vehicle at foot steps & have to go in public transport. Very vibrant & popular place with numerous visitors visiting during this time"
207,Goddess of this region,This place is attracts me lot. Two reason for that one is Very nice and natural place and second is idol of goddess saptasrungi. Very nice place you need to take 300-400 step to reach over the temple. The car/taxi/bike you can get from vani villege to go over the hill.
208,Awesome Monsoon Place and trekker's delight around,"Saptashrungi temple is a holy place of goddess Shri Saptshrungi. This temple is about 2 hours from nashik . Recommended you get a personal cab and there is also bus option from nashik. The temple is located on the top of the hill of Vani. It situated between the mountains. Also there are lot of monkeys in the mandir area. I always found them snatching water bottles and food thing from devotees. There is more crowd during specific period like navratri etc, so please check before plan. Now for darshan there is also have ropeway option.I visited this place several time. We all family members gather there for darshan. It's very nice and beautiful place. Divine place. Awesome atmosphere. Saptashrungi trust have dining area which has food on very low rate and also trust guesthouse is better option to stay."
209,Sapthashringi a hill temple near Nasik and Saputara,Temple area is under construction. Parking is a problem. Local store keepers have occupied areas and charge parking upto 50 rupees.
210,Nice temple up the hill,"Lord Brahma, the Creator had sourced River Godavari from here. There is a reservoir where the water from river Godavari has been collected"
211,nice...,Saptashrungi is located in a range of mountains. The mountain formations are unique and are a hard rock. The goddess is somewhere in the middle of one of the mountains and for Hindus surely a place for visit as it is one of the 3 1/2 Shakti Peeths. The goddess is just in an inclined posture with 10 arms. The ST bus station is just at the foot of mountain and plenty of other transport facilities are available. One can hire a vehicle from Nasik if you are in a group. There are just OK food facilities around. Climbing 500 steps for those who can or else rope-way is being commissioned shortly. Going to the top gives a good view of mountainous range. It will be a great pleasure to visit this place during monsoon season as you will be able to see waterfalls and green grass mountains.
212,Temple Saptashrungi,"one can find roads, Reaching to the temple as a nice way to ride bike.You can always find friends and families celebrating as pilgrims and devotees at the temple"
213,Worth it !!,"One amongst the Shakti Peeths, the Saptashrungi temple is well maintained and is of religious importance.The drive from Vani to Saptashrungi temple is just breathtaking during monsoon. Surprisingly road is very good and you can take stops in between. Marvellous view of Sahyadris !Please be careful while driving through the fog."
214,A truly divine place.,Some good reasons to visit Saptashrungi:- Road journey and views from Vani to Saptashrungi- Management at Saptashrungi (specially new rope train which is so much helpful for senior citizens and also at reasonable price)
215,Half day visit,I went to Saptashrungi. The Saptashrungi temple is also situated in the hill range. This temple is held in high accords by the Hindu traditions. The traditions indicate that the great goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini dwells right between the seven hills. It is great place to go.
216,A temple worth the visit,"The Saptashrungi devi temple is located at Vani about 120 kms to the north of Nasik. You are almost at the Gujarat border. It is very popular with devotees and a great place to visit.From Nasik, take the Dindori road and follow signs all the way till the temple. Vani is a small, typical temple town. Find parking at one of the shacks and prepare to trek up about 500 steps to the temple. There was a ropeway being constructed - not sure what stage it is in. But the route is all shaded and it is a comfortable trek.The temple itself is quite congested (so avoid going in crowded periods like the Navaratri), but on most days you will have a peaceful darshan. The devi idol is huge and shows the goddess with 17 arms. Spend some time contemplating the goddess and bowing to the power of ""Shakti"".There are some eateries at the village where you can get basic snack dishes. Stick to the local fare (bhajji, missal pav, vada pav) and be prepared to eat spicy food. If this is not your cup of tea, bring some food with you from home.Be careful driving up the ghat section, which is long, winding and pretty narrow. Have a safe travel and get blessed by the goddess."
217,awsome spot of devi saptshrungi mata,What can be said about Maa Saptashrungi. There are quite a few steps but there is a train soon to be started to the Bhavan from the base of the hill- it was on test run when we visited. You have people available wth palkis for elderly people
218,Spritual temple,It was a great place to visit with your family. The roads are good. Easy to reach without any traffic...Take blessings of Shiv in this temple

220,Must place to visit in a lifetime,"Saptashringa Garh is a place where Goddess Bhagawati dwells.It is one of the most important of the places of Goddesses in Maharashtra. Saptashringa signifies seven mountain peaks.  In front of the temple there stands Markandeya Rishi's (sage) hill. There are about 108 water reservoirs on the hill, known as Kundas. Vani is situated at a distance of 60 km away from Nashik.It's a faith that bring you at the feet of Ma Durga. It's a pure religious to have darshan of Ma Durga viz Ma Bhagwati Devi."
221,The stairway to Heaven,Best place to visit to get Blessings of Maa Saptashrungi devi during Navratra the festival of goddess Strenght The SHAKTI
222,energy and spirituality,Visited Saptashrungi Gadh just after Dussehra and was pleasantly surprised to see the Funicular ropeway being operational. Very convenient and the place is very well maintained. Great Job there by the temple authorities and the government.  Darshan was quick and great as there was very less crowd. Ropeway ensured that we had the darshan in 30 mins tops.A divine place to be and the increased facilities has only made it better.
223,nice place to climb,"When I say ""A mix of experiences"" I mean three things.. The climb, the scenic view and the spiritual sense of this place. It's said to have around 500 climber-friendly steps, however an elevator straight from foothill to the top is under construction (a thought for senior citizens). As you cover the distance, you'll start noticing hills on the right.. I'll say halt for a while, observe the hills, feel the breeze and connect yourself with nature (prefer visiting in first half of the day).. Situated on top of hill range, Saptashrungi Temple is two storied shrine with the Devi enshrined in the top floor. The Devi image is carved in a cave at the base of a sheer scarp rock face. Explorers, definitely a place to visit!"
224,Superb temple,"Saptashrungi) is a site of Hindu pilgrimage situated 60 kilometres (37 mi) from Nashik in west Indian state of Maharashtra in India. According to Hindu traditions, the goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini dwells within the seven mountain peaks. (Sapta means seven and shrung means peaks.) It is located in Nanduri, Kalwan taluka, a small village near Nashik in India. Devotees visit this place in large numbers every day.[1] The temple is also known popularly as one of the ""three and half Shakti Peethas"" of Maharashtra. The temple is also one among the 51 Shakti Peethas located on the Indian subcontinent and is a location where one of Sati's (first wife of Lord Shiva) limbs, her right arm is reported to have fallen.its half shaktipeeth among three and half shaktipeeth of Maharashtra."
225,Saptashrungi Devi Temple near Nasik,"If you are planning for Shirdi - Nashik -Trimbak or Saputara. Must add this place in your list , this place is located on Sahyadri mountain, high altitude place ,Goddess Saptashrungi temple , around 400 steps are there to reach . Nature lover must visit this place. Very beautiful scenery all the time i visited this place right after monsoon so it was very beautiful & mind blowing ."
226,on the hill - exclusive,"Vani is one of the Shaktipith among 3 1/2 Shaktipiths of Maharashtra.This is why it is important among Hindu Devotees. I visited the place during Mansoon, Stunned by Natural beauty and waterfalls . Temple is at Hill top, Be prepared before going to Darshan as you have to climb 500 steps to reach the temple. Please carry your Water bottles. Goddess is said to be Self Manifested,you will feel the spiritual power once you enter in temple."
227,Too much crowd,"This was my second visit to the temple of maa saptshrungi...the first one was when my family was away and I was alone on Diwali last year. I had planned a trip to Vaishno Devi during that time but somehow that got trip cancelled. I was feeling really sad about same think maa did not want to give me darshan but sooner Maa in her other form of Maa saptshrungi called me for her darshan.Reaching there was as mesmerising as visiting Vaishno Devi. Paharo wali mata, Maa saptashrungi too is a representation of Adi shakti and place is one of the ShaktiPeeth of Bhawani. It is a well managed pilgrimage wherein trust there offers all kind of accomodations, subsidised canteen etc. Food of Prasadalya is also awesome and quite homely. Maa's idol is beautiful and is on a small hillstop asking bhakts to climb good number of stairs. However once inside the temple, one forgets one's sorrows and pains. I heard that maa saptshrungi is very sensitive to the prayers of her bhakts and people have lots of faith in her powers and blessings. Darshan of Maa saptshrungi are fulfilling and joy giving. May goddess bless all and one including me and my family."
228,nice place,"It is 2 hours journey from Nashik.Road leading to Saptashringi  after one leaves Pnachavati is flush with farms of grapes, tomato and other vegetables on both sides.they are available fresh in roadside market. One has to be careful in parking car as police make regular rounds and fines heavily  if the road is blocked by your car. The shrine is located at height which create shortage in parking place. The locals charge for parking vehicles."
229,Shaktipith! Power of Goddess of Seven Hills,"The recently commissioned funicular railway service is a major tourist attraction by itself. Coaches come every 5 mins. Entry to and exit from a coach is well managed. Good used my use of access technology and logistics has been made. Even things like shoe custody booths are well managed. The Craik stration has clean washrooms and a shopping arcade  cum food mall. Things are so well organised that, except probably on religiously very significant days, one can park his car, finish the visit as well as lunch or whatever and be back to his car within two hours."
230,religious,"A great place to visit, quick getaway from Nashik for a day. I had a holiday during my business trip, thought of visiting this temple hoping to get some blessings and some nice shots…Started around 11AM, got a bus from old CBS upto the main “Gadh”. Bus frequency is good, so you can plan your trip for anytime during the day, not sure about late hours. Took around 2.5 hrs to reach destination, with some good scenic views on the way. Lots of food stalls are available at the base, eat some light snacks as you will need lot of energy to climb. The stairs actually test your endurance, took me around 15 mins (excluding 10 mins of three security checks, I was carrying a back pack which was checked thrice, inside out, my suggestion: drop any additional stuff at base). For old age people, you have option of palanquins. There was some construction work going on for tram.Took me another 15 mins in queue before darshan. You are not allowed to click snap of deity, still some people did. I prefer to respect rules, so I did not. You can offer your prayers and there are lot of priests available if you want to do some special pooja. Took another 10 mins to return to base. The base is low on hygiene, muddy paths. Better if you can carry food with you and eat it on way back to Nashik, can stop at one of the spots giving good view and enjoy food.Took another 3 hours to return to Nashik. Finished trip in 7 hours, tired, but filled up with blessings from the almighty…"
231,The goddess of seven hills !!!,We are fortunate enough to have the blessings of Saptashrungi Mata. If you go with the mythology It is believed that both the Chins of Devi Sati fall on this place & after that this becomes sacred and one of the 51 Shakti Peetha. This place is fairly 70 kms away from the nearest city Nashik.Govt & Pvt bus service is available to reach here but i suggest if u want a comfortable n pleasant journey u must hire a car.This place is beautiful during the monsoons as it is covered with mountains and u can feel like hill station. Its almost 10 kms of ghati road (Valley) & not much difficult to drive if u r a good driver.U can have a glimpse of good scenic spot while traveling & after reaching the foot of the temple u can get all the pooja accessories with a reasonable price from the parking area available.As the temple is on the top of the mountain 2 types of arrangement is there one is conventional steps(approx 450 to 500) & another is funicular ropeway. If u r tavelling with old age people or person facing difficulty to go by steps u can opt this ropeway facility which cost u 90rs per adult and 45 rs per children above 4 yr to 12 yr.After reaching the top of the temple well maintained passage is there through which u will be guided for Devi darshan. Here devi saptashrungi is worshipped and the idol has 10 hands.Darshan will be of max 30mins duration if there is little rush. After darshan u can have some food in the food courts available at the mandir premises to reach the mandir buttom u have to use the same ropeway which u have booked while going top so for that u need to keep ur booking tokens safe.Photography is strictly banned inside devi temple but i saw many people taking selfies with devi idol from a distance dont do this as its illegal.As a whole u will have a nice experience after this visit.If u have a passion for photography then a plenty material waiting for you. So lastly i recommend for nice n safe holiday.Happy Holidaying.
232,Saptshrungi maata ki jai,Super fine experience. It gives you the wonderful and divine experience. along with little adventure
233,nice development from tourist point of view,"Devine place. We visited in Navratra. Huge crowd was there. But management was found to be good. Bogie type ropeway has been introduced first time in India, which has the capacity of carrying 60 persons at a time. It shunts in every less than 5 minutes. Rs 80/- is the charges of to and fro movements. Statue of Maa Saptah dungi is grand and splendid with big lively eyes. Visit only if you have religious inclination."
234,got peace,We took the road by chance as police was diverting traffic due to the heavy rush of Janmashtmi and we ended up at this place. Took a break in our journey here looking at lush green hills with fresh hues of greenery washed by the rains.
235,Saptashringi Mata ki Jai!!!,"Saptashrungi or Saptashringi is a site of Three and a Half Shakti Peeth in Maharashtra. This is half shakti peeth situated @ Vani 60 kilometres from Nashik. The image of the Devi is huge-about 8 feet tall with 18 hands,holding various weapons.http://saptashrungnivasinidevitrust.org/home.html"
236,Vani Gadh,only one word ...breathtaking. Breathtaking while going up. Breathtaking while using train( furnicular ropeway) to reach temple..exhilerating darshan in the august company of mid size monkeys. Due to small crowd size very personal darshan and pooja possible..This temple is about 2 hours from nashik . Recommended you get a personal cab. 7 hills surrounding  the temple are outstanding....visiting this temple is an experience of lifetime.
237,Amazing Experience!,The Saptashrungi Devi Temple is a cave Temple. The very attractive Saptashrungi Devi Idol is carved in the Mountain rock. About 450+ steps take us to this Shrine. There is Bhakt Nivas & Prasadalay run by the Saptashrungi Devi Trust at very low cost with Good Quality.The Scenic view of the Gorgeous Mountains around & the Spiritual Experience must be Experienced atleast once in a lifetime..!!
238,Complete peace of mind,"Saptashrungi was in our itenary on our way back from Saputara to Pune. A 22 KM diversion from Vani.. including a 10 KM ghat road drive will take you to the shrine. Be prepared to climb flight of steps (about 500) to reach to the shrine. The rush on our day of visit was moderate. We managed to come back to the parking in about 1.5 hours.There are many private parking available. We were charged Re. 50/-, as we did not purchase any puja items for the shop.You are not allowed to take coconuts to the temple. You need to deposit near the entrance."
239,Saptashrungi Gadh,Saptashrung hill is nice palce to visit. Lord Saptashrungi mataji's temple is such a great location... their is beautiful nature to enjoy and photoshoot.
240,It's a must visit,A temple is situated on the hill to be climbed by steps or by recently opened . A road in somewhat good condition leads to the hill from village Nandura. Car parking facility available. Huge gathering of devotees during Navaratra and other auspicious days.
241,best experience,Its our kuldaivat.  So once in year I do visit Saptashrungi with my family.  Now there is funicular trolley so one get within 3 minites at the top and after climbing few steps you can take darshan. Its very useful for seniour citizens and those who cant climb 450 to 500 steps. Wheel chair and lifts are also available. In rainy season the climate is very nice.  You can see greenary small falls on the way.
242,Saptashrungi,It was totally a new experience altogether.The crowd has increased 1000 folds.The fanicular tram has made the darshan little easy and tidious also. One needs to spend 2-3 hours in queue at different levels. Rail is fast and comfortable. They could have made it a rotating route so more people can take darshan of Devi and people would not have required to deboard the train. Also the old charm is lost of climbing up the hill. The construction of doors around idol is also hampering the view. There should be separate line for close and distant darshan.
243,Saptashringi,"if you visiting saptashrungi temple then as a advice ,if u are fit to walk then please go to temple from base by walking.walking route having many waterfalls to see with mesmerising natural beauty."
244,Superb location but poorly maintained,"The deity of the temple is Saptashrungi mata, which is another name for the Shakti Mata - Chamundeswari. The legend is that The Martha rested here after the killing of mahishasura demon, in this lovely location nested among seven mountains.It is a drive about 2 hours from Tryambekshar temple.The pilgrims are well cared for. The climb up the hill via 200 + steps which are well spaced and not tiring, the steps are also well protected from the sun by a neat roof.There is a rope way nearing completion which will be of great convenience to pilgrims.There are three Gum Ganesha idols installed also.A nice and satisfying visit for the devout."
245,Must see place,"Saptashrungi, a place near about 15 km from Saputara is a classic example of upland, table top, and a plateau, converging and a temple in amidst of it."
246,Jai Saptashrung Niwasini Devi...,"Not very well known but a very powerful manaat fulfulling temples, and I would knw it as I too have been blessed with the givings off Maa Saptasrungi. A very pleasant drive from Nasik about 40 Kms, will definately go once again to Go to take blessings. The place was also one of the Forts of Shivaji."
247,BE BRAVE,But its a long way out of the city. Should start early in the morning by 9.00 so that the day is not wasted.
248,Unique Religious place,Saptshrungi is situated on 7 hills some 65 km from Nashik city.Saptashrungi Mata have 18 hands and is one of avtar of Goddess Durga.Place is on top of the hill and pilgrims go to temple by stairs as well as by funicular train.
249,"Shree Saptshrungi Devi, Vani, Nashik.","Saptashring Gad is the holy place due to temple of Shri Saptashringi Devi. According to the myth, in ancient times, the Goddess (Devi) killed Mahishasura, the Danav (Demon) and rested forever at this place later became popular as Saptashring Gad. I am a frequent visitor at this place as I love the climate, the atmosphere and the the divineness of the place helps me to gain the complete peace of mind...If the Government decided and pays more attention this place can also be turned into a popular tourist destination and can be developed as a Hill Station...The main problem here is Staying and Eating Facilities are not still very developed...But, apart from that I love the place...."
250,Good place,"Temple of Goddess Saptashrungi , 60km from Nashik in Kalvan district , can reach by ST buses ,private cabs ( available near CBS stand) .worth visiting ."
251,Religious,Yeah it's nice to see over here too much clouds rain's monkey's after then must relax point I remember when I'm coming with my family in 2001 . Nice managemant .
252,jai maa saptshrungi.....18 bhujawali...teri jai ho....,"The experience was nicebe there in the early morning, u need to take appp 500 stepsnicely built temple atop the mountain morning darshan at 9 am lot of monkeys(but not harmful), be careful, they need just to eat and drink"
253,"Serene, sheer... The Saptashrungi, Vani.",The place is around 1.5-2 hrs drive from Nashik (depending on which part of nashik you are driving from). It is a temple at the top of hill. Funicular trolley make it very easy to reach the temple. But even with funicular trolley you have to climb some stairs - so people who have trouble in climbing some stairs - should not think that if they take funicular trolley - they do not have to climb stairs. Also there are lot of monkeys in the queue area where you wait for your turn to get darshan(see holy goddess). I saw them snatching bags containing water bottles from devotees and at times bag containing some items which they want. So it's exciting to watch them but at the same time it is risky as you never know what they might snatch next.
254,Jai Mata Ki,"First of all, how do you review a temple ? You can't.It is roughly 40 kms from Nashik (thru Dindori). If you are going by a car of your own, you will have to park it in the parking spaces available before the temple begins. There will men hovering over your car as soon as you enter the last 100 meters, to get you park in their space. They dont charge you parking fees, but you have to buy the Pooja samagri from the shop aligned to them.Then you climb around 400 stairs to reach the temple. They keep your footwear for nominal charges, and they do not allow coconut as part of the Samagri, due to security concerns.Then when you reach at the top you stand in a zig zag long queue between barricades to get a 2 minute Darshan of the Devi.Beware of the monkeys !!It is an enjoyable drive with excellent road all thru out. So you will enjoy the drive for sure. Really worth it !!"
255,Amazing place for pilgrim and adventure,I visited Saptashrungi gadh in the month of December 2018 during the Christmas holidays. The climate was very pleasant and been a holiday season there were many people. The introduction of India's first Funicular trolley makes life easy for the devotees. At Rs 80 for adults and Rs 40 for kids & senior citizen its a very affordable option to climbing the steep stairways. The complex where the trolley starts has a huge parking space. So do not get fooled by the people standing on the roads and asking you to park at the side of the road near there stalls.They will charge you anything upwards of Rs 300.  The vendor operating the Funicular trolley needs to install directions and signs to guide people to its complex. I noticed that the main gates of this complex is blocked from people's sight by shopkeepers who offer parking space by putting up sheds. This way unsuspecting people are confused and fall in there trap. Once you make way to the trolley complex kindly pay for your tickets and stand inside the complex in the queue. The complex is very well maintained and has a robust security. I was standing for around 2.5hrs for the same due to the rush but the journey in the trolley was worth that wait. It took me up within 3 mins! The trolley capacity is for 60 people so the waiting time should be less when there is less rush. I would like the temple trust to be prepared of any stampede like situation since the crowd surges during festivals and holidays due to the addition of this trolley. There is a space crunch and people management is something they should focus on seriously.
256,Beautiful drive to Saptashrungi temple,You have to start early in the morning so that climbing 400+ stemps is easier.   We reached just before 7 am.  The deity was being dressed at that time.  It was nice to watch the devotion and care with which the deity was being attended to by the priests.  Aarathi followed and we had a blissful time.The Maharashtra Government has taken efforts to make the road nice right upto the temple.  A cable car project seems to be stopped midway.
257,Jai Maata Di!,saptshshrungi temple is a holy place of goddess saptshrungi .this half pith of 3 1/2 pith of goddess.now to have darshan at top of hill trolly is provided so you can skip steps.
258,Pretty good !!!,"We did take an auto from Nasik to reach the place but still had to do quite a bit of stair climbing and walking. But once on the top, it looks so beautiful and quiet. Monkeys are menacing, keep them away by throwing a bit of prasad towards them. Do take a can if you want to collect water. Water tastes really good.There are lots of temples around but we visited only one, the origination of Godavari."
259,Saptshrungi,"saptashrugi is one of the 51 shaktipeeth goddess temples in india and one of the 3 1/2 peeths of maharashtra. it is very important center. the devi is situated on a hill top with about 500 steps. but one need not worry about that as right from bottom to top all the way it is canopied so it is good to go anytime. we purposely avoided the chaitra navratra utsav as in navratras the temple is full of devotees and has full rush. so please visit anytime avoiding the navratra which come thrice in a year.there is a dharmashala for staying but we didnt see it but i guess it must be average .roads are preety good for going top ghat section . it is 10 kms drive to the saptashrungi gad. we enjoyed the darshan and were satisfied .we could wait in the gabha gruh for almost 20 mins.ample parking place is available with chappal stands.for old people who cannot climb the steps ,there is a facility for doli ."
260,Totally divine temple,Please go to this if you are physically fit and you are not accompanied by young children. View from the top of the hill was nice.
261,"Saptashrungi,Godess who makes you happy inline","Saptashrungi devi temple is located at saptashrungi mountain 22 km from Wani.The goddess idol is huge and beautifull with 10 arms ,you can offer your offerings at te temple.there is also a bhaktaniwas where you can stay with family and also mahaprasad center is located there itself which offers food upto 2pm at a minimal cost..It takes almost 450 steps to climb up to the temple.If you can not climb,you can take doli to the temple.There is a trolley system that is going to be introduced this month onward.Its 60 km from Nasik.There are not many restaurant options on the road from wani to saptashrungi gad."
262,JAI AMBE-jai ambe,This wasn't a planned trip. We were travelling to saputara from Mumbai for a trip. We were suggested by a friend for this location. The place is good. It has about 520 steps to climb up the mountain to go for darshan.
263,Beautiful temple,"The temple can be reached via ropeway or 500 stairs. The ropeway option may require you to wait for an hour or two, so we chose stairs. Those are fully covered so dont worry about sun or rain while going for this one. It ll require a total of 2 hours to do darshan and be back to the parking spot."
264,the temple shape mountain,"Saptashrungi Gadh is a Hindu pilgrimage site near Vani, Nashik, Maharashtra. The name ‘Sapta’ stands for ‘Seven’ and ‘Shrunga’ for ‘Peaks’. Thus, the temple is surrounded by seven hills. Saptashrungi temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas in India. A large number of devotees visit Vani Devi temple every day.The Dhodap, in the center of this mountain range, is the highest peak with an elevation of 4,600 feet (1,400 m), and Saptasrungi is towards its west.Nanduri and Vani are the villages nearest to the temple, which are situated at the foot of the hills.Some good reasons to visit Saptashrungi:# Amazing landscape and beautiful; views# Road journey and views from Nashik to Saptashrungi# Management of new rope train which is so much helpful for senior citizens and also at reasonable price. Kudos to the management at Saptashrungi"
265,Good Heighted Place,"Nice arrangement to climb the stairs. Locals will stand in middle of the road and will force you to park your vehicle but try to drive till end,"
266,Beautiful Journey culminates in beautiful destination,"The distance from Nashik to Vani via Dindori is 39 kilometres. It is located near the Saputara, which is a cool air place. According to Hindu traditions, the goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini dwells within the seven mountain peaks. There is a temple of Saptashrungi mata."
267,Saptshrungi mata ki jay,"Saptashrungi is a site of Hindu pilgrimage. According to Hindu traditions, the goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini dwells within the seven mountain peaks. (Sapta means seven and shrung means peaks.) The temple is also known popularly as one of the ""three and half Shakti Peethas"" of Maharashtra. The temple is also one among the 51 Shakti Peethas located on the Indian subcontinent and is a location where one of Sati's (first wife of Lord Shiva) limbs, her right arm is reported to have fallen."
268,Saptashrungi Devi Temple,"My experience was awesome.As we reach nearer to mother,cool breeze starts rejuvenating us.As if some form of energy is giving strength to climb that gad,and as u reach there at her abode, u become totally peaceful.......a must place to be visited.//JAI SHREE MATAJI//"
269,Great Place,"After climbing few steps, the crowd came at a standstill. We had to stand like that - rather slowly climb up - which took 3 hours. Worst part is, there is no way back when to stand in the line. There was no proper ventilation, not enough light and no one to control the crowd. Any small thing could lead to a mishap like stamped. It is really shocking how this place is mismanaged.There was a security guard who was stopping our vehicles 1 km before the temple and made us park in a open place. But when we finished our darshan, it was dark and there was no facility to go to parking lot. Walking there also would have been risky. So we took a lift (again a risky choice but no option left) and went to parking lot - only to see our vehicle standing there.My god, will never go again. Sorry Devi Maa."
270,Saptashrungi Devi,"Shreedevi Saptashrungi vani devi is one of the 51 shakti peethas in India. The idol is said to be self manifested (swayanbhu) on the rock of the mountain clifffrom the base there are 500 off steps..My mother who has serious corns on her soles and usually finds it difficult,managed to climb this place in about 45 mins purely by faith, devotion and will powerhighly recommend a trip if you are in Nashik..carry your own food and water"
271,good religious place,if it is piligriage journy than dont expect to much. what ever pain you have earned Just take AASHIRWAD AND DARSHAN FROM SAPTSHRINGI MATA and you will gain from pain
272,Saptashrungi- The goddess of 7 hills,"According to Hindu traditions, the goddess Saptashrungi Nivasini dwells within the seven mountain peaks. (Sapta means seven and shrung means peaks.) It is located in Nanduri, Kalwan taluka, a small village near Nashik in India."
