0,It brings back memories of a good old movie,The monument is devoted to a dog with a sad story.  There was a book and a Soviet movie about the tragic fate of this dog.  In downtown Voronezh they put a monument of this dog.  It is considered to bring you luck if you rub its nose.  I was walking nearby and just looked at it without rubbing its nose.
1,Voronezh--A trip to remember!!,Good and friendship monument to dog.He likes tenderness.Location on central street near dolls theatre.
2,Bim,"To get to Voronezh and view local color, I took the train from Moscow to Voronezh. For the most part it was uneventful except I got in the wrong compartment and no one could speak American. We resolved the problem in 30 seconds. Well, a very large train car matron resolved all issues. All she had to do was point and her finger was the law.I got off the train, very early morning, on the loading ramp in Voronezh and saw this young woman running up and down the ramp, mumbling in Russian. Before I got to the door she asked me who I was to see and she then told me to follow her. I did!She checked me into a hotel and told me that the lady I was to see was out of town and would be back tomorrow. Ok!  Next, I was asked if I wanted a bed warmed for the long cool night. I said no and went to sleep for a while.When I woke up, I looked out of the window and there was an open air market. One of my major weakness is flea markets. So I went down stairs, telling the clerk where I would be and went shopping. I walked for about 3 hours and then sat down to soak up some sun. Then, this nice old man, sat down across from me and Started a conversation. I listened to him for another hour or so, just nodding or shaking my head. I don't speak or understand any Russian but I made his day by giving him all of my attention.  I felt great!Finally, my girlfriend came and found me and took me to the apartment that I was to stay in.  Then we came back to the open air market and bought, fresh, over the counter our supper and took it back to the apartment and  she made the most wonderful borsch ever.I was told to take my shower before noon. I asked why and didn't understand. Found out why. They shut off the hot water until 5:00 pm to save money.  I'm use to cold showers.Bottom line:  I enjoyed Voronezh, it's people and the very charm of stepping back in time a little.I want to return!"
