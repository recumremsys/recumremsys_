0,Amazing,"I went to vaishno devi from lucknow firstly I reached katra by bus and on the same day I started my journey to the mountain with my mother ,father and masi I gone through ardh kuwari route it is 18 km from walking and we rest there afterward after a longtime by walking we reached mata rani mandir and come back as my overall journey was lovely and I am so happy that I gone there and next time whenever I get the chance I I will surely go there amazing place."
1,Amazing impromptu visit,"I took a cab from Jammu in the morning on 17 October and went straight to Banganga Army Camp, Katra. Being a veteran, Indian Navy, got the Yatra registration slip from there otherwise you have to get the same at the bus stand, Katra. Then started the spiritual journey on a pony which you have to hire from the designated booth for this purpose. The weather was awesome, entire Trikuta Hills, the abode of Ma Vaishno were cover with mist. In one hour I reached Ardhkwari which is 6 KM from Katra. Fromthere went on foot via Himkoti to Bhawan a distance of 5.5 KM. Hired locker to put my stuff & did excellent Darshan entering through Army Gate or else you have to register to get your group & turn for the Darshan on the designated point there on arrival. All indications & help are available from the Na. Wish o Devi Shrine board. Thereafter had a wonderful Rava Masala Dosa & South Indian filter coffee at  Sagar Ratna restaurant priced very reasonably. I also  enjoyed the Ropeway ride to visit Bhairon Mandir. This is an excellent facility & costs just 100 INRs for the return trip. Return journey to Katra by walk & pony was completed in 2 hours comfortably. The standard of cleanliness is very high throughout. There is no bargaining or any unnecessary nuisance. All facilities are available on the way. A must visit even if you are not religiously inclined. It‚Äôs a tourist delight giving you a great opportunity for a spiritual & physical work out. I could cross over 40K steps on my Fitbit despite using a mix of pony rides & walking. Jai Mata Di üôè"
2,My nineth consecutive visit,I visited this temple with my family. We visited katra by train and started journey within 2 hours. The 12 kilometers upward journey was quite comfortable. A lot of facilities were provided by shrine board on the way.
3,Its wonderful moment for me,"I visited vaishno devi and bhairav baba temple with my family. I walked up hill of 13.5 KM and down hill of 12 KM in one day, Though at the end of journey my legs were paining but it was really a memorable trip with a sense of pride and conviction to Maa Vaishno devi."
4,The serene holy yatra,We started our walk from Banganga at 7 pm and reached Bhavan at 1 am . Had very good darshaan as it was not too crowded then.
5,Blessings,"We went to Vaishno devi temple during Navarathiri Festival, We started walking from Banganga at 6 PM and we reached temple at 1 AM. We had an VIP pass and finished the dharsan by 2:30 AM. The Whole place was like heaven, there were beautiful decorations for Navarathiri festival.  We were very exhausted so we came back to Katra by horse riding."
6,Truly Divine Feeling,"lovely & lifetime experience to visit mata ka darbar.we started from katra at 6 in evening & reached via himkoti route at 11.30, the new route from tarakot is also operational now..it is1 km less than the earlier route.it is still under construction & you may find not as many shops as on earlier route from ardhakuwari. Mandir premises were clean & easily did the darshan.Only drawback was cleanliness in the bathing area for women, which was dirty & not sufficient for so many people visiting at all times ."
7,Divine,"Hi everyone,Jai Mata Di.I had planned the trip from Hyderabad. From Hyderabad I started journey in flight and reached Delhi on June 7th morning. From Delhi I had joined my family (around 10 members one 9 yr Kid) from Delhi station and taken train to JammuTawi at 4:00 PM. We reached JammuTawi station by 5:00 AM morning 8th june. From Jammu Tawi station we had taken train to Katra by 6:30 AM and reached at Katra station by 8:30 AM.Railway facility in Katra is quite impressive. We have taken Yatra Slip in Katra station. There was different queue for Ladies and Gents and everyone has to stand in the queue to get the Yatra Slip.We got fresh at Railway station and taken bath as well. IRCTC food provided in Katra was so good in quality and worthy. (70 Rs for full meal 2 rotis , rice, curry, Daal and Raita).After having lunch we had started the trip to Devi Maa darshan around 1:00 PM afternoon. And taken Auto riksha for BaanGanga. ( You can go on feet but better take ricksha 10rs Each). At BaanGanga entry you have to show the Yatra Slip and have to scan your baggage.Better carry less baggage as it will be difficult to climb up with more weight. Now the trip starts for Vaishno devi Ma darshan. There are so many shops down hill where you start journey for Prasad, sticks, snacks, lunch etc. At Baanganga entry only you can get ride for Palki (3150 Rs one way), Poneys etc. No one can cheat you as there will be proper receipt for your Palki or poneys booking. For Kids you can hire a trolly.Every 500m you will get Toilets and water source and every 2km there is dispensary. Ambulance facility is also available if anyone faces critical situation while climbing up. If you are good enough to take steps , steps are available till Ardhkumari (Around 3000 steps). I will advise do not take steps go with normal path.After 7Km of climbing we reached Ardhkumari. For darshan in Ardhkumari again you have to show the same YatraSlip to get a number. While returning you may get your number for Ardhkumari Darshan if crowd will less. We got 541. The status was 141 that time.While returning it just reached 342. So we missed it.There is trust bhojanalaya available on the way. There you will get food at reasonable rate. Like Rajma chawal 40 rs, Tea 7 rs. Water is free all the way along.Eventually after taking so many stops we reached Vaishnav Devi Hill top by 11:30 PM of 8th June. It was so crowdy. Hardly getting space to stand. Little bit chilled weather comparatively down side of the hill. But you can manage in full shirt or t shirt.After that we had taken bath and changed dress as we were going for Darshan. We went in 2 group. As we had baggage and Cloak room was full. You have to wait for hours to get your number for cloak room. The we had thought to go in two groups. Hardly it took 1 hour for darshan.After darshan we had taken 2 hrs of sleep. And stood up in line to get Roapway ticket for Bhairav Baba darshan. Counter was opened by 7:30 AM. But people were standing in the queue by 5:30 AM morning. We managed to get tickets for Roapway It cost 100Rs for round trip. We did Bhairav baba darshan. That is the hill top. You can get a good serene view of entire vaishanav devi temple. I had clicked photographs as well.After that we returned back to Baanganga. It took 6hrs for us while returning.Overall experience was so good. People should go as it's holy place and you will feel spiritual power withing the valley.Jai Mata Di !Thanks,Aviral+91 7893082890"
8,Divine place and a must visit,"We traveled here by train from Delhi with some friends..and as it is a Holy place do we decided to trek And avoid Helicopter option which was much easier nd tempting..:)for trek i must say u have to be little fit...i was just surprised by the amazing arrangements made by     Vaishno Devi and Jammu government like blankets ,medical help everything was available during the trek..The Vaishno Devi temple looked so beautiful from outside and inside  after spending some time in the temple we decided to go to Bhairon baba temple which was even more steeper and difficult..At 5 am we came back to Katra .We visited Katra Maket in the evening ..a beautiful market filled up with dryfruits ,shwals,religious suff etc but here please be more attentive while shopping ..beware of all fraud shopkeepers"
9,Mata Vaishnov Devi Temple With North Yatra,"We visited Vaishnav devi  on 4 oct 2017 , we arrived at katra the previous day and stayed at a lovely hotel called KC residency , the next day we were to take the helicopter at 7/45 am but were able to leave only by 11/45 ,it's very systematic at the helipad and takes barely 10. Min to reach , after that you need to walk around 2 or 3 Kms to reach the temple , of course there is an option of horse or doli , if you have a 2 way helicopter tkt you get a VIP pass and there is a separate que ,which ultimately joins the common que , we had to stand for about an hour or so , they don't let u stand for more than a second ,there are a lot of restaurant where u can eat , , toilet facilities are there enroute , the place is generally kept clean , we went on oct 4 and it was quiet warm , I was told it starts getting cold only Nov onwards even that is bearable and not too cold"
10,"Vaishno devi, my soul finds peace there....","so I went to this yatra after 14 years approximately and believe me a lot has changed since then. I would try to answer all the questions that were in my mind before I began this journey so anyone having the same questions could benefit from this.so i started off from mumbai by air landed jammu. there are prepaid taxi available at the airport for rs.1500 approx one way. they also offer a drop at the helipad .there is a requirement of registering for the yatra and get a yatra registration parchi which is kind of your entry ticket no matter which mode of darshan you choose. it is free of cost and lot of counters are available. one counter is also available at the airport. keep in mind the validity of the parchi, you gotta start your journey within that time.HELICOPTER: if you choose the helicopter way here is what you need to know (atleast what i can help you with)1) helicopter booking is only available online. booking start 2 months prior to your date of darshan in simple terms make sure you book 2 months in advance for a sure shot ticket. the tickets are available by registering on the official shrine board site.2) there is also a current booking counter but that simply means you may get a heli ticket in case of cancellations out of the advance booked tickets3) the current booking counters opens at 6 am in the morning but the line starts as early as 4 am. only after the counter opens you will know your fate that if any cancellations are there to accomodate you.it is pure luck you might get a ticket as late as 4 pm and still make it to the the helipad before the last heli takes off that is around 5-5.30 pm. so you gotta decide an upper limit upto which you want to wait before you take other alternativesas for me the counter opened at 6 and closed at 7 and i wasn't in the first 20 to get the ticket but i decided to wait little more and finally thanks to god, the counter opened up again at 9 and i got in the second lot. there were a lot of cancellations during my visit because of the recent attacks in jammu. i would suggest prebook the heli tickts if possible.4) once you land on the sanjhichat the main bhavan is a 3 km walk downwards. you can hire a pony or a palkhi which is easily available outside sanjhichat5) after the darshan next step is bhairav temple. which was my faviourite part. the new ropeway facility made it possible to cover the 3 km distance in a mere one minute time. and back in one minute. your time gets cut down to 10-15 mins for bhairav darshan.in the helicopter scenario if you do not go downwards you miss the adhkuwari but your main bhavan and bhairav can be covered in half time considering the crowd. hope this helps in planning your trip jaimatadi"
11,Very peaceful,Visited vasihno mata bhavan and ardhkuwari and track for 12 kms to reach there and lovely darshan - feeling blessed.
12,Religious Place,"We (me and my wife) went to Vaishno Devi temple on May 2017. I had booked SSVP aarti. We landed on Jammu and went straight to Niharika and checked in there (part of the SSVP package). We got a AC room but as their was no electricity the AC was not on, but the room was decent. We took rest for around 30 mins, freshen up, left our luggage at the cloak room in Niharika and left for Banganga. It took us almost 5 hrs to reach Bhawan from Banganga (we took lot of rest in between). Do carry you cameras as the view is good and very scenic. Also, if you have booked for SSVP then you dont need to deposit anything in the cloak rooms, so carry whatever you want to (but keep it light). Once you reach Bhawan, you dont need to stand in the queue and get a group number assigned (if you have booked for SSVP) you can directly go to counter no.4 (you need to walk around extra 1 km roughly). You just need to show your reservation print out, photo Id's and present the card through which you made the booking. The room at the Bhawan is nice, we had some water issues as there was some pipeline problem but that got partially resolved. The food is of good quality. We rested in the Bhawan at night and reported back to counter 4 at 5.45 am from there we went inside to the aarti area (just outside the holy cave). Everyone was given a aarti book and a Jai mata di headband. We sat there for sometime and then went inside the holy cave, they made us stand as per our height and then allowed us to get inside the holy cave where we could see the main panditji performing the puja. There is enough space for 10 people to stand. After the puja we were given Prasad and was again taken back to the aarti area we sat there for some more time (till the aarti got over) and then were back in our room. It was honestly a divine experience. We had our breakfast and then we left for Bhaironnath Mandir. Although it is just a 3km distance, the climb is more steep. While climbing down we took the steps and where back in Banganga in around 2:30 mins. Note - Avoid taking stairs while climbing up."
13,Peaceful,Visited Jammu with family and travelled to Mayra. Then by helicopter to Martha temple. The visit was awesome and the travel by helicopter was superb. The Devine temple and its atmosphere creates a new mind
14,Vaishno Devi Darshan,"I was planning to go to Mata Rani ( VAISHNO DEVI TEMPLE ) from eight years ago when my prayers were answered ( My wife was sick ). We went last October ( 2019 ). People say you cannot go unless Mata calls you. Go there ,Mata will do miracle. But Helicopter trip is cancelled sometime due to low visibility."
15,Jai Mata Di...,I visited Mata Vaishno Devi during August 2015.We booked sleeper bus from Chandigarh at RS.600 per head.. it's a Air-conditioned average sleeper bus. We started journey at  11.00p.m reached next day early in morningWe need to check-in at Katra near bus stand We booked 2 Dormitory at bhawan @ Rs. 100 per head which is very economical & good decision.Then we left for Vaishno Devi bhawan from Katra ... we enjoyed alot during journey ... as it was rainy season so weather was pleasant. We took new path from ardh kwari .. it is very comfortable then older path.We enjoyed coffee at CCD & Rajma Chawal at shrine board eating points .We reached bhawan in evening & take rest at our Dormitory it's very clean & well maintained.After taking bath we had darshan of Mata ..Had dinner at Sagar ratna hotel Early morning left to bharonath Mandir by walking& Returned to Katra in afternoon.
16,Jai mata di,"We visit Mata Vaishno Devi Mandir, Katra along with our friends. We started our journey from Katra in the evening. And reached mandir in night and in the early morning we visit holy shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi and come back to katra. During our visit in night mostly shops were open for refreshment."
17,Tranquility at its best,We went to the mandir on horseback which is almost 3-4 hours. Long queue for the darshan which took almost 2 hours. Mataji darshan was only a minute. Wish someday we can spend some more time with beloved maataji. While coming back took helicopter ride which was a very good experience.
18,Beautiful temple ,It was awesome place. we started out yatra around 7 am and reached bhawan around 12 noon. its upto you how fast you walk You need to deposit all the belonging in the locker whcih is near by the place you stand for queue for holy cave darshan than we started our journey to bharon baba temple which is around an hr time to reach and one can have incrediable pic from such height. it is said that without bharon baba temple darshan vaishno devi yatra is incomplete
19,A highly revered Yatra and Darshan,"Day 1 We reached Jammu Tawi at around 830 AM by the Duronto Express from Delhi - train was 1 hour late. We had read a lot about how taxis fleece us for the Katra trip and the need to display our bargaining skills. None of that happened as we checked with the Prepaid taxi operator's stand right opposite Jammu Tawi. Very well mannered people and we got a taxi which took us to Katra in 1.5 hours (Basic taxi costs Rs.1,100 plus tolls). Drivers are well mannered. If you book a return at the same time, you get Rs.200 off and have to pay only Rs.2,000/-. Proper receipt is issued at the taxi stand.We checked in to the rooms Spiritual Growth Centre which we had pre-booked on the shrine board website and spent the day walking around Katra town, enquiring about routes, preparing for darshan the next day etc. There are restaurants for all budgets located near the bus stand. The weather was unusually pleasant in December.Day 2 - We had breakfast and took an auto from bus stand to Banganga checkpost (Rs.100 as per the tariff chart). We hired 3 horses @ Rs.700 each to Bhawan.(again, the rates are mentioned in the tariff board - so no need to bargain). The horses know their way and the horsemen run behind the horses, egging them on. The foot paths are roofed for major part of the journey and are completely paved. So the pilgrims are protected from rains. There are shops selling food stuff, darshan items etc. all along the way. The horse ride took us 2.5 hours, including a short break mid way. We learnt that the same journey takes 4-5 hours by foot. The major drawback appears to be having the same pathway for both horses and pedestrians, who are forced to move to the side whenever horses pass by.Once we reached Bhavan, we asked the horsemen to wait and take us to Bhairon Cave as well and later drop us at the helipad. They wanted the same Rs700 to cover their return as well which we felt was not much. All items, including shoes, pens, combs, cell phones, bags etc. need to be deposited at lockers provided free of cost near the main gate. Keep only your purse and loose change when you enter the temple. Luckily the crowds were moderate and we finished our darshan within 30 minutes. After that, we began the ascent to Bhairon‚Äôs cave. This is much steeper. But for the horses, I doubt if we could have ever managed this. This takes around 45 minutes and by 130 PM we got dropped at the helipad for the return trip. We had booked helicopter tickets in advance and the journey time took us just 10 minutes. After that we took an auto from the Katra helipad to the bus stop @Rs.50 per person (shared ride). By 2:30 PM we were back at Katra.Day 3After taking adequate rest. (3 hours on horse back wreaks havoc on your back and joints), we took the taxi back to Jammu. Jai Mata Di."
20,"once in a lifetime, must visit","I had a wonderful visit to Mata Vaishno Devi Temple on 9th Mar 20 even though there was a very heavy rush. This time I returned from the New Tarakote Marg. Though it was a bit longer, I found this route comfortable, neat and clean devoid of any rush. At Tarakote we had dinner at the free Langar. I'll recommend this route. You should be aware that this route does not have the facilities of palaki or pony."
21,A great pilgrimage trip,It was awesome place. we started out yatra around 7 in the eve and reached bhawan around 5 in the morning. its upto you how fast you walk as we are doing out yatra with my parents so it took around 10 hrs but it was awesome. we attended moring arti which is wonderful. need to deposit all the belonging in the locker whcih is near by the place you stand for queue for holy cave darshan than we started our journey  to bharon baba temple which is around an hr time to reach and one can have incrediable pic from such height. it is said that without bharon baba temple darshan vaishno devi yatra is incomplete
22,Best trip ever,We visited mata vaishno devi in April month with my wife. It was Very crowded place and very nice management made every shrine do not felt any problem.
23,Blessing of Maa Vaishno Devi Darshan for Kashmir Tour 2019,"We decided to Seek for Blessings from Maa Vaishno Devi to commence our Journey to Kashmir. Had a Very Peaceful & Quick Darshan. Weather during the Daylight was very Warm, but surprisingly Weather after the SunSet changes in Contrast to very Chilly & Cold."
24,Jai Mata di ,Place has a huge number of devotees and when I reached I stood in line for around 3 hours. Darshan are open 24 hours
25,Trip of a Lifetime.,We reached Bhawan before 4 am and we planned to have darshan before the aarti coz the aarti will took a long 3 hours.........but when we came closer to the bhawan the mob went crazy at yatra parchi stamp booth and prasad centre(as u also buy prasad from private shop) . It almost took 2 hours for us to buy prasad and get stamp at yatra parchi (you can opt online yatra parchi but for stamp you have to visit the booth as do I). No arrangements for such a large mob CRPF millitants were like minions and cant handle the mob. As we saw fights and fights and we also fought at many ocassions.  No. of visitors were 80 k per day averagely during the month of june as told by a staff member. No lockers available toilets are flooding outside and no management by the Mata viashno shrine board. Not recommended at all during summer vacations try to visit on non seasonal time..............Jai maa vaishno devi.
26,Jai Mata Di,I had visit  23 March Vaishno Devi Temple. It was great journey. My guide Lalan had arranged everything for me. He has arranged a horse ride to go on high in the mountain. I had visit there Vaishno Devi Temple and had there a Darshan. It was awesome. After that he brought us to Bhairo Baba Temple. Bhairo Baba Temple is on the top of the mountain. It was a unforgettable journey for me.Jai Mata Di
27,Chalo Bulaava Aaya Hai,"I have been to Mata Vaishno Devi Mandir Katra many times but this time I visited with family. We had booked helicopter tickets which is good based on my understanding from other reviews. So planned to go with it. Booking can be done only in official website of Mata Vaishno Devi Ji.We enjoyed a lot with all our journey by the blessing of Mata Ji and also attend the Arti in Mata da Darbar which was amazing for all of us. After doing darsan we started to move back. We wish Ma Vaishno Devi gives happiness, health and wealth to all the  visitors who visited this holy place."
28,Jai Mata Di,i had travelled to maa vaishnodevi in Nov;15. and decided to go every year. best time to travel is last of Nov to mid Dec. best place to travel nature lovers.. i will suggest to stay at night at Maa vaishnodevi temple. it was very child and coffee shops are opened 24X7 . you will love to have a coffee at night . there is free blanket service . and service is starting at 8PM . if you want to see snow then most go in last Dec to mid Jan. very nice place
29,Jai Mata Di,"We started our journey to Katra from Amritsar by road on a hired car. It took us about 7 hours to reach Katra via Jammu. People should know once they enter Jammu no prepaid mobile numbers work only postpaid numbers work. Katra can also be reached by train or flight up to Jammu and from Jammu by road.We had booked early morning helicopter service for reaching Sanjhichhat. We booked it online from the official website of Vaishno Devi shrine board. The booking opens 60 days before the date of visit and a return trip costs INR 2010. It is very efficient and takes 4 minutes to take you to Sanjhichhat helipad.  From there it is a walk of about 2 1/2 kms that takes about half an hour. There is also palanquin and ponnies service available, those who have difficulty in walking may avail the service. Palanquin service for one person costs INR 2500 for a return trip. You also require a Yatra slip which can be booked online. The walk from Sanjichat to the temple was not tiring as the road was well maintained. There are many  shops on the way from where one can purchase the items for puja and offerings. Once you are near the temple you have to keep all your belongings in the lockers available there and can carry only valuables. There are many entrances and you have to be in the queue. We visited on a Monday and was off season so it took us less than an hour to have the divine darshan. We were  lucky to be taken through the old cave that's open for public rarely these days due to large numbers of pilgrimages. Passing through the narrow cave isn't easy and is an experience itself. By the grace of Devi we had a very good darshan and could stay for some time and do the offerings properly due to being a less crowded day. There are many restaurants and refreshments shops available. All servings are strictly vegetarian. From Vaishno Devi, one should go and visit Bhairo Baba temple as it's said the visit to Vaishno Devi is incomplete without visiting Bhairo Baba temple. Bhairo Baba temple is further up the hill and a walk of about 3 kms. The climb up to the temple is very steep and us stressful. Palanquin and ponnies services are available. We consider us to be very fortunate to have visited the Vaishno Devi temple without any obstacles by the grace of Devi. Jai Matadi."
30,üôèüèºüôèüèº Miracle,"KATRADistance from Katra Bus stand to Banganga (1km max)We reached there by 12pmWe started walking and reached Banganga by 12:45pmWe had Yatra Parchi, so we entered BangangaBANGANGAEntry point for Yatra, a proper check of your baggage and body will take place.(NOTE: NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE ANY TOBACCO, CIGARETTE, HOWEVER I WILL RECOMEND DONOT TAKE IT AS THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF OTHER CHECK POSTS DURING THE YATRA AND YOU CAN BE EASILY CAUGHT, ALSO NO HARM TO LEAVE THESE ITEAMS FOR A DAY OR TWO)Also I had my Canon DSLR (this was allowed to carry, however be mindful and you will be carrying extra few kgs, so ask your self first as do you really want to carry this..... but when i carried this, and clicked some wonderful pics, trust me the load was paid off)So, soon after crossing the security check, we had a free lunch at T-Series langar, which is just after you cross the check post. Then I sent my wife and kido on pony( Rs 350 till Adhkuwari)BANGANGA - ADHKUWARIIf you are traveling by your own, this is the only toughest segment as the height is approx 2000 ft, with a distance of 6KM.(I am 35yrs old, didnt find it very easy). However with some stopover and regular water consumption, this distance was covered by us in 4 hrs.(in our group the youngest girl was of 7yrs and oldest person was of 45yrs, my kido is of 3yrs hence sent her along with my wife on pony, trust me I later on realized that how wise that decision was)Also If you are traveling in winters, donot wear heavy winter jackets as you will take that off soon after you start tracking.Instead you can wear small woolen sweaters and carry you heavy jackets in bag.(only you need jackets, if you plan to stay at Adhkuwari or Bhawan, other wise if you plan to return the same day then you dont even need them at all. Note: Temp dramatically drops after sunset)ADHKUWARI (18/12/2016)Similar to Jammu Tawi, we had our dormitory beds booked at Shailputri Bhawan (Rs 120 per Bed). This place is just 100meter from Adkuwari Temple.One room had 12 sets of bunk beds (24 people in one room), Blankets were provided for free (with a refundable deposit of  Rs 500/blanket). Even like Jammu Tawi, this boarding place was also very clean and well maintained. The entire hotel had only dormitory beds and still they had geyser in bathrooms."
31,sooo awesome,It's my first tour in jammu and we decided to first viste maa vaishno devi temple.it amazing place for me it's goddess of hindu and many traveller I will see they will went up to the mountains with a along shouts. And many people visite always and we track and enjoy this place most of all tour. It's my very special tour.
32,A VISIT AFTER 50 YEARS,"Situated about 40 kms from Jammu is Katra from where one starts the 'yatra' on foot for about 13 kms to reach the holy shrine. Chanting Jai Mata Di' the worshippers gain energy and confidence that the can reach the holy shrine. Enroute there are many food and refreshment stalls. Helicopter, pony and doli service are also available. Katra is now accessible by train also."
33,Jai Mata Di,"Darshan on 8th Jan 2017Started early from Baan Ganga at 6.45 am and kept walking with 'Jai Mata Di' chants sometimes silently sometimes following fellow pilgrims call and sometimes greeting the returning devotees.Reached Adhkuwari around 8.20am. Here I took the path through Himkoti to Bhawan as there are no Mules/Horses in this route and it is more calm and clean. the scenery is also divine and beautiful. The first look of Bhawan after Panchhi point is just Divine. It was raining till Himkoti which slowly turned into a snowfall as I approached BhawanAfter the final checkpoint near Manokamna , there is Prasad counter where one can buy prasad at nominal rate of INR 25/-, INR 40/- and chunni at INR 125/-. No need to carry the prasad from Katra as it will add weight to your baggage.For Old people there are battery buses from Adhkuwari to Bhawan at INR 300/- going and INR 200/- coming but chances of getting tickets even are less.the new motorable road from Katra to Bhawan is now complete and can be made open to public any day.Please wear woollens during this time and carry rain coats in-case of rains. Kindly keep the family members and old people in a group and take time for completing this divine journey. Wish you all a nice Darshan. Jai Mata Di"
34,Stay at Katra,"I had the privilage to visit Vaishnu Devi, a very holy shrine for Hindus after 27 years again. The trip was enjoyable due to fine weather and excellent arrangement of the shrine board. Walking through the Trikuta mountain under green envirnment was very refreshing and enjoyable."
35,Avoid Tarakota Marg Route for Darshan,"My friend and i from durban,south africa,went to Vaishnoo devi  temple. We took Jammu mail from Delhi to Katra.train journey was simply awesome especially  the views.we reached Katra on 17 August.started our trek at 0345 am on 18.its simply awesome.climb gets tough but we did it by foot climbing up and back down.truly amazing,views are breathtaking.well maintained Temple.was truly magical experience.very powerful place.one can feel the  spiritual energy.its very busy so one cant get to spend much time at the main prayer altar.you are pushed out too quickly.we would definitely visit again next year and will stay at bhawan.after your visit to Maa Vaishnoo Devi you never stop  thinking about  your experience.truly awesome feeling.JAI MATA DI.."
36,A must visit for every indian.,"We started the yatra by 3 am in morning and reached bhavan by 9 am (12 km)..till ardhkumari way is bit stiff and tough (around 6km) after that there are two ways to reach bhavan 1. Hathi matha 2.himkoti marg, took second option as it was shorter, less stiff and free from ponies. Whole path is covered and seats are available on both side for short rest..ponies and pitthus can be hired on presdfined rates. Yatra parchi can be taken online or though desk available  at airport, railway station,Carry ID proof alongwith yatra parchi.Tea and coffee available throughout the way on nominal rates, Bhairo ghati is 2km away from bhavan, bit stiff to climb, take stairs to save time and energy. In return follow the same path.Battery-powered vehical available  from bhavan to ardhkumari for senior citizon and physically challenged person.Old cave was closed during our visit, we have been taken through new cave.One can feel rejuvenated after reaching inside the divine bhavan after long yatraIt will take 3 hr  to return ( take staire to save the time if you are physically fit).We took total 15 hr for return journey with senior citizens in our group."
37,Divine Experience,"The Vaishno Devi is located close to Katra on Hill top.  I started my climb on hill by 6 pm and reached by 11 pm and had Darshan. It is always better to start in the evening to avoid the heat of day. There are some food options on the way to Hill top. If you can't walk, you can hire a horse or palki or even a helicopter. Overall a great experience."
38,Review of the trek from Banganga to Bhawan,"We had visited Vaishno Devi temple with family and it needs an entire day. Even if you travel on horse (Khacchar) it is tiring as the final lap you need to walk (climb up). Walking all the way up takes you around 3 hours with breaks. Even if you take a helicopter or any other means, you need to walk the last leg of the journey. The security is very heavy with check 6 points which scans you completely. It is understandable considering the state affairs. Its best to haggle with the horse keepers to take you to the top. The arrangements are excellent, with water provision, clean toilets, eating joints all through out the steep climb. The shrine also has an ashram to stay at a very economical rate and seemed very clean. In the final leg, you cant take anything inside, no wallet, no prasad nothing, just you and yourself, you get lockers to keep all our stuff before you enter the shrine. Finally when you visit the divine deity, it is all worth your efforts."
39,Divine Visit,went there this november after diwali.was impressed with the management of shrine board. the path was well lit and clean. toilet facilities available all along the path.Excellent views and great darshan. every person should visit at least once and feel blessed.Jai Mata Di.
40,Every single year it's bliss,"The temple located in Jammu is famous for Mata Vaishno Devi... We went in October 2016 with the family and friends... The temple is 13.5 kms from Katra there are various mode of transportation are available from Katra to Bhawan including Ponies, Electric Vehicles and Palkis. Helicopter service is also available upto Sanjhichhat.."
41,Divine visit,"I been there with my family, I used to visit mata vaishno devi on every 2 year. This time i booked ATKA aarti in advance, My entire family attended morning aarti and followed by Darshan. It was amazing .. Thanks"
42,Mata ki Bulawa,"Reached Katra by Train early morning at 5:30 am. Checked in the luggage in hotel and after getting refreshed, Started walk at 9:30 AM from BANGANGA check post, with young kids 9 and 13 years old. As it had rained the previous night with hail, it was very cold and by morning it started to rain for 30 min. So the start was bit delayed.Reached Ardhkumari at 1 pm. This first 6 km of walk is the most steep one. really tough for legs. People take to stairs also , but some say to avoid it. So it is up to you if you are fit then steps is lot preferred. This trail is very busy with walkers, ponies, palkies and shops. Because of ponies it stinks a lot all the way to Ardhkumari. From there onward last 5 km to Bhawan, there is separate ways for ponies and pilgrims, so much better and fresh air. All the way well laid out path, mostly covered to protect from sun and rain ( no need to carry umbrella or rain jackets). Water, snacks ,beverages , ice cream, and food available all along the way.Keep your hands free.Toilet facilities are conveniently located along the way approx at every two km. But it stinks and could have been maintained well. BUT SOMETHING IS AVAILABLE.Reached bhawan at 03:30 pm, with lots of stop on the way, and cool drinks break for kids every hour.First thing first get your Yatra parchi stamped before start, in between and also at top for online they do only at the top.Book online in advance for accommodation at Bhawan, other wise you will end up sleeping on walk ways around the bhawan. Blanket's are available free of cost. We have seen people taking there luggage all the way to the top, prefer to keep the luggage at Katra as it is very difficult for the first timers like us to take the luggage to top.Before getting in Darshan queue, you have to lock all bags, phones, cameras, and shoes in locker room. Just go with prashad, parchi and wallet. if the queue is long carry a bottle of water. Toilet Facilities available along the way while standing in queue. Common people enters from gate no 3 and VIP pass holders from gate 5 ( VIP pass must be obtained from katra)Our dharshan finished within 1 hr.Sign boards in Hindi and English are very well marked and placed at right place for directions. Do not miss them.It would have been better if the km covered is highlighted as reflector boards every 200 meters, but black stenciling is visible at some places and not at other locations.Katra to Bhwan you can start walk any time 24 hrs, well safe and lit path. Parchi time at katra is ( 5 am to 11pm) Better to book online Yatra Parchi, to avoid queue at katra to get yatra parchi. It saves lot time. Yatra parchi counter is also located next to bus stand , along with JKTDC locker room and hotel.¬†On way back we took ponies for all four of us and they mention different rates on the board, the pony operators negotiate some other rates and by the time you finish and ready to pay you end up paying 1.5 to 2 times the fare mentioned on the boards by the shrine trust.Helicopter service is also available but the timing and weather matters. It closes by 4:45 pm-5:00 pmOverall a wonderful experience and nice scenic view from top.Jai Mata Ji."
43,I went on Divinel visit yesterday to Ma Vaishno Devi‚Äôs Durbar. What a pleasing experience it was as always !!,"This is my 4th Visit to Mata Rani Darshan, This time we opted Helicopter Service & from sanjhi chat to Bhawan it took around 30 mins. As we walked easily. Huge Rush was there, The Maa Vaishnav Shrine Board started Bhajan Music on the way was upto Mata‚Äôs Bhavan. This was really I found energetic. But the Horses really disturb to the visitors on the way & there waste smelles bad, though the board has done very good arrangements for cleaning. We started 8 am & back down at around 1 pm. The Mata Vaishnav Devi‚Äôs Darshan was superp. As it was huge rush, authorties were not allowning more than 2 sec. Per person before Mata‚Äôs Pindi‚Äôs, So if any one visit there please concentrate on Pindis in that span of time."
44,Full family trip,I visit maa vaishnavi devi temple every year and its a best ever place in whole india to visit and hospitality of local members and services rendered by jammu kashmir police and indian army to piiligrams and tourist people is also good.
45,Best experience,"We travelled from Delhi RedFort buy a overnight Bus journey to Katra by Ashok Bus Service. Suggest dont take this service as the tour operator left us only at Jammu Tawi. It was confusing how to reach katra though we took a cab and reached to our hotel. As it was peak hot summer day we decided to start for vaishnodevi in evening. Left hotel at 5PM collected our darshan tickets and took Auto to reach BangaGanga checkpost. It is a 1Km distance from city to Banganga and Auto charges Rs 100 fixed. From there after clearing secuity checks at 6 PM started climbing. As a senior citizen was with us so took Pony. Note to bargain with Pony wala. They charged Rs 1100 per head for climbing up. It took 4 hours to reach at Bhawan. As we travelled in June it was extremely crowded and stuffy. Best time to go there is in winters. Please carry some blankets or Sweaters as it is cold in the night. Inside Bhawan Mobiles, Wallets, Jewellery, etc is not allowed so keep it in lockers above. Bhawan darshan took 2 hours to complete. Post this is it is mandatory to visit Bhairon Temple 3Km from Bhawan. While descending down again we took Pony it cost Rs 900 per head on bargain. Do be careful to stay together with your family as Mobile Networks are not accessible. Shrine board need to work on Food Availability and Clean Toilets."
46,Best experience !!,"We drove from Gurgaon to Katra via Jammu highway by car , roads were very nice and apparently no slopes or Hills areas, Feels you are driving on flat roads. (Bad for Nature).#We reached a day earlier to gain blessings on 31st Midnight , so we took a short visit to Patnitop . go straight to Nathuhills - it was covered in Snow and we took a guide and paid him 1500 per couple to do slopping , provided us with Gum Boots to avoid mud. Fun experience , Nathuhills opened for us at around 4 PM due to Traffic . so plan a early visit. #We Returned to Katra same night, preped ourselves for 31st Hiking to Vaishno Devi. started climbing at around 11AM , We walked all the way top by Foot , taking stairs at times to fasten the pace and reach the top by 7 PM . Now i will put Bad things first then Good things at the end as what happpened during that course of time:1.Lot of Horses , no cleanup of DUng and horse riders(pitthu) their Attitude is worst , they will run over you if you dont pay attention , so BEWARE , walk Sideways and Stop when needed2.Women Restroom - Everyone Pees in them , No cleaning , worst site , They were better once you start climbing but as you go top , they are a FEW and in bad shape. ardhjumari and Bottom one are Hygenic . I still dont get as why they dont spend MOney and awareness around TOilets for Women. Men are supposed to pee in worst so not even mentioning it here.Shrine Board can do better with Money being offered for Womens. Ironically it will be a good offering for Mata , anyday seeing less trouble for womens. I hope people understand soon the pain women go through holding the pressure and walking and trying to save themselves from Infection and getting Dehyrated avoiding waters for such a long journey. anyways old story i guess.3.People Jumping the queues ,fighting over Prasad counters, Police men slapping people (Biharis mostly) to move forward in lines , No Lockers availability , shops asking for 1000/500 rs to keep your stuff, No seperate queues for Senior Citizens apparently or specially challenged people (Because everyone is equal in God's eye) but VIPS have a privilege. anyhow , despite all that once we reach the shrine , there are 2 gates both have same Shrine as people told us, we were allowed to look at 1 sec and PUJARI shoved a Girl and Threw a Guy's Rs10 Offering , how in the World you can do that. We shouted at Wrong People , told Policemen of what was going wrong - may be in hope that next time when similar situation happens they would know that someone reminded of that previously n who knows their heart changes. Point is avoid travel on Over Crowded days as ShrineBoard is not equipped to handle such crowds or maintain discipline.   May be it was Mata rani's blessing that no major trouble happened to us and we came back safely , with a slight Hope that if there were BARS/Handles to let everyone be in line and there is more management and TOilels for WOmen- Wouldn't it be a happy trip for everyone, sshhh .. That was the wish we made .I am sharing my experience - just take the pointers home and plan better , I still would come to Vaishno Devi again - just at different time and hopefully will share the comments to Board with support and make it a better place for pilgrims like us to have a good experience for Old folks, girls. Jai Mata Di."
47,Battery car at maa Vaishno Devi temple,We started from the Darshani gate and took 5 hours to reach Bhawan. For the ladies and children from ardhkawari to bhawan EV carts run but the waiting and tickets are tough.Our darshan were just spiritually out of this world. Weather was cold in last week of March during Navratras.Bhairo like always was our last stop before our descent. Sagar Ratna has good South cuisine at Bhawan.Photos attached by me for purposes of rates of horses / pony and other important disclaimers.
48,Holy Maa Vaishno devi,"Jai Mata di,recently we visited Vaishnodevi  in august  with family.Devine place and we can not express the feeling of happiness."
49,Fulfilling Visit,"Vaishno Devi Temple is in Jammu and Kashmir, you can go by flight and train both from jammu you have to go katra and then take the yatra slip to vaishno devi temple, attraction is for friends, family"
50,MAA SHAKTi,"We went to Mata Vaishnodevi on 8th October,2016 by Helicopter. The system of operation is nice and smooth and we enjoyed a lot as because we were 18 members including children."
51,Jai Mata di,I visited Vaishno Devi katra in the month of May with maah frndz.. We travelled there by roadways bus.. After reaching there we have to cover 14 kms by walking Nd that was very gorgeous.. overall that was best days hanging out with frndz to Vaishno Devi katra..
52,Jai Mata Di,"On my annual pilgrimage,I stayed at Hotel Prakash.It is a very good budget hotel near Shalimar Bagh."
53,Pilgrimage cum Tourist Place,"Its was my First trip to Maa Vaishno Devi, I was so eager to see that holy place where an uncountable number of pilgrims used to go daily, whether it is hot summers, rainly julys, thundering Dec to jan, when u start your journey, it automatically gives u the feeling that u r blessed by maa Vaishno when u just stepped up there.Now, the route to Vaishno Devi is very convenient, u can have so many option to visit smoothly without feeling tired.u may get horses, pony, pitthoos, or u can even book Helicoptos to go there.Once u see the three idols of Mata Rani..u will get everything u desire. then from there we gone to visit Bhairon Baba temple, without which ur journey is not completed. Jai MAta Di"
54,Jai Mati Di,"Now its very easy to reach there and get mata vaishno devi darshan. Train from Delhi will go directly to Katra the nearest station to the mata darbar. You can take helicopter ride and you can reduce almost 10 km of your journey out of 12 km. when you reach near the mata darbar you will feel peace from inside, its too natural."
55,JAI MATA DI,"Myself and couple of my friends decided to visit Mata Vaishnodevi shrine. We took a train to Katra. I was amazed at the cleanliness at Katra station. It was simply superb. It also has an escalator and a lift to help older people to carry their baggages.  In fact the station was much cleaner than Bandra or Kurla terminus in Mumbai. We visited in the first week of September. Please note that it is the most lean period to visit the shrine. There are hardly about 8k to 10k visitors around that time and so you can peacefully do darshan. If you want to stay at th guest house near the bhavan then please book your rooms before you start your walk. All helicopter bookings must be done online before your journey. Our trip was very enjoyable, although the shrine volunteers can improve in terms of keeping the path more clean and there must be proper directions displayed for first time visitors otherwise it is very difficult to find your way. There are no proper signages or boards which can help the visitors to reach their destination with ease.A pilgrimage to the Holy Shrine of  Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Ji is considered to be one of the holiest pilgrimages of our times. Popular the world over as Moonh Maangi Muradein Poori Karne Wali Mata, which means, the Mother who fulfills whatever Her children wish for, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Ji resides in a Holy Cave located in the folds of the three peaked mountain named Trikuta (pronounced as Trikoot). The Holy Cave attracts millions of devotees every year. In fact, the number of Yatris visiting the Holy Shrine annually now exceeds one crore. This is due to the unflinching faith of the devotees who throng the Shrine from all parts of India and abroad.The Holy Cave of the Mother is situated at an altitude of 5200 ft. The Yatris have to undertake a trek of nearly 12 km from the base camp at Katra. At the culmination of their pilgrimage, the yatries are blessed with the Darshans of the Mother Goddess inside the Sanctum Sanctorum- the Holy Cave. These Darshans are in the shape of three natural rock formations called the Pindies. There are no statues or idols inside the Cave. Darshans are open round the clock throughout the year."
56,Jai Mata Di,I am gone to Mata Vaishno Devi more than 2 times in a year and having full faith in Mata and all of my family having faith in Mata Vaishno Devi Darbar and Mata gives me each and every thing by the grace of Mata Vaishno Devi
57,Divine abode!,"I visited maa Vaishno Devi temple yesterday and due to my old age being senior citizen , used battery car .It operates between ardhkwari to bhawan to and fro. It takes about twenty minutes one side only. It can be reserved online also by registering at maa vdshrine board site. Normally it has maximum capacity to take seven passengers excl driver. It goes with good speed and experience is very good . Old age persons have a good advantage if they want to use it. Online reservation gives more advantage. Direct tickets can also be procured , but the window is different . Sometimes you have to wait as cars are on charge. Whatever. This facility is a great welcome step by shrine board . Charges are affordable."
58,Jai Mata Di,We visited vaishno devi in the month of may. We started our journey on 11th may at 9.00 pm. At night. This is best time to start your journey to words mandir. First you have to take entry pass. From bus stand or online or best option from your hotel. I which hotel we stayed they given us entry pass for mandir. Note.: No mobile network . In between you will get network bus less....bee along with your family.  Take water bottles and food items. Because journey is too long. We started at 9.00pm at night and reached at 4.00am by walk. You can also take pony/horse 800-1200 also you can take helicopter ride but not in night rs. 1100  per person.in arti  gate close from 5.30 to 8.00 aprox 2hr.So plan accordingly.
59,beautiful darshan after long tracking,"I was planning to go to Vaishno Devi temple since a pretty long time and this was also my first visit to the temple. Was kinda scared as I was traveling with my 3 year old kid and was not very sure on how I would manage the climb with the kid. Foreseeing the difficulty in climbing; I‚Äôd booked to and fro helicopter service well in advance. Will explain the Itinerary in detail for clarity -Day 1 (at Katra) 8:40 AM - Reached Katra via Delhi-Katra Sampark Kranti Express. Train is the best mode to reach the nearest destination (i.e Katra) and the train made good sense. 13:00 PM - After taking some rest and bath in Katra guest house we reached helipad destination where we were informed that the service was cancelled that day due to bad weather. The cancellation worried us as we had to do the climb ourselves now. However, we moved towards BANGANGA where the climb would start. Kindly note that you can book ‚ÄòYatra Parchi‚Äô (kind of registration and identification for Darshana)online and this shall avoid getting into queue at BANGANGA. We opted for a stroller for the kid (charged Rs.500)  till ARDHKUMARI (which is half way through the climb). The stroller was pushed by and the person carried our bags too. 16:30 PM - The climb from BANGANGA to Ardhkumari was almost 7 km and we were completely exhausted till then. Here we had an option to go to BHAWAN (main temple) via a battery car and we opted for it. However, the counter was closed till 19 PM! After almost 3 hrs of wait we got the tickets for Battery Car and we reached BHAWAN by 20:00 PM. 20:00 PM - We were stunned by the long queue for Darshan (as Aarati is scheduled at 20:30 PM) and we didn‚Äôt have stamina now to go for Darshan. So we decided to have dinner (@ Sagar Ratna restaurant) and went to our Room which was booked in GAURI BHAWAN. We slept till 22:00 PM as we had now planned early morning Darshan for the next day. Day 2:4:00 AM - We started early as we had to do Darshan at Bhawan and rush to BHAIRAV temple and reach SANJICHHAT Helipad by 7:30 AM. We completed Maata Rani‚Äôs darshan within an hour as rush was minimal at this time of morning and then checked out of Gouri Bhawan guest house. Considering the paucity of time we booked two ponies (BHAWAN to BHAIRAV to SANJICHHAT) which costed us Rs.650 each. 5:45 AM - We reached BHAIRAV and completed our Darshan within 30 minutes. Early morning Darshan is always suggested as both mind and body are fresh. We reached SANJICHHAT by 7:30 AM as planned. 9:00 AM - Fortunately weather was good and Helicopter service was operational. We reached down within minimal time and moved to our guest house. POINTS TO NOTE:1. There are 3 Pindis in the main temple Bhawan (Mahalakshmi, Mahakali and Saraswathi). One may ignore the pindis during rush hours and time allowed to be spent in front of pindis is scarce. Hence ensure that you keep your eyes completely open and focus on the Darshan. It will be a magical moment and ensure complete attention here. 2. There are ample means of making your climb easier (helicopter, ponies, pithoos who carry the kids, palkis). However the most effective way is either to go via helicopter (if infant or elderly are there) or to do the climb oneself. By doing the climb partially, I realised the worth and is highly suggested. 3. It is recommended to make the room reservations in BHAWAN (main temple) well in advance via the Shrine Board as getting rooms at last moment is next to impossible. Also Maata Vaishno Devi‚Äôs charm is good enough to vanish our tiredness and gives us eternal strength to handle any kind of situation. The Darshan is a lifetime experience and highly recommended. Jai Mata Di üôè"
60,"""Jai Maya di""",I traveled from Katra to Sanjhichhat by helicopter and from there to Bhawan by walking. I had one disabled child (Autistic) with me but that was no problem. I reached there in 45 min. It id a good three kilometers from helipad. I could get a locker and entered through gate no. 2 (VIP gate). It took about 30 minutes for darshan and the priest allowed me to stay there for a minute and say my prayers. While returning also we came by foot. The intial road from Bhawan is having steep climb. But it was ok. I could get 1230 helicopter from Sanjhichhat and returned to Katra. Overall very nice darshan and blessings of Ma. Will surely visit again and possible on foot. Jai Mata di.
61,Jai mata di ,Visited Mata Vaishno Devi Temple for first time. I was accompanied by my wife. Atmosphere was full of spirituality.
62,Maa Vaishno Devi Darshan in 10hrs 10 min.,Awesome Journey by train from Jammu to Katra Railway Station between Himalayas and in Tunnel. Mata Vaishno Devi is a must visit place for everyone.
63,Divine,"By the blessing of matarani me and my friend with our families visited Vaishno devi mata. This was my 3rd visit.My parents my 11 month old daughter and my friend's 5 years old daughter went by helicopter. I was very tensed because I was suspecting that helicopter will not fly because of rainy season but by mata rani's grace the helicopter services resumed after 10 days on our day of visit.Remaining 5 of us started waking from baan ganga check post by 7:45 in morning. It took us 6 hrs to reach bhawan, we didn't stopped at ardhkavari. After taking some rest we went for darshan and it took us just 45 mins to do darshan and come out.Weather was bad till a day prior to our visit but on our day of visit it was clear and sunny.Everyone was very tired after reaching bhawan that nobody has stamina to go to bhairav mandir so we decide to come back from bhawan itself.It took us 5 hrs to come down. For my mother we took palki from bhawan to baan ganga and it coasted us 3500 (costlier then to and from ticket of helicopter) but as we had booked only one side helicopter booking so we didn't had any option. My father walked down by himself.My 11 months daughter was with me while walking down. We had a baby carry bag but she started feeling uncomfortable in that after an hour. And after sometime she felt asleep so I had to carry her into my lap all the way.For our 3 small bag packs and to carry my friend's 5 year daughter we hired a pitthu which charged us 500 rs.There is an option of battery operated car from bhawan to ardhkavari for senior citizens. But getting a ticket for that is the biggest challenge as there is a long queue for that and there is no advance booking for it. I think the ticket for battery operated car is 200 per head.There are food stalls all the way so you really need not to carry any food item. If you are travelling with small kids then you carry some of the food item for them.Most of the track is covered so you will be protected from direct sun light and rains if there are any. From ardhkavari if you go by new track then it's easy and less stiff.Don't miss the rajma chawal at various shrine board refreshment center.The mobile signal is available on most of the track but if you are carrying a prepaid mobile sim then it won't work in whole J&K. Only postpaid phone works here. Getting a locker at bhawan is very time consuming task, it may take more time then actual darshan. So try to carry minimal things.Jai mata di...."
64,Peaceful Place!,"I have been to ‚ÄòVaishno Devi‚Äô many times but this time I visited after 7 years with my family (myself, wife and 5 year son)  and parents (senior citizens)I had booked online helicopter tickets  (Himalayan Heli) 60 days in advance for reaching Sanjichat. If you are in Jammu, take taxi, bus or train to reach Katra. In case you are coming directly from Delhi, make sure to have train ticket until Katra to reach Katra  without any hassle. It costs you around 200 rs to reach katra helipad from katra stationThere are 2 operators for helicopter service: Himalayan Heli & Global Vectra. I had booked Heli helicopter which is good based on my understanding from other reviews, so decided to go with it. It cost me 2010/- Rs for return journey- they have same day return & Next day Return. My advise is to take Next day  Return journey if  you have time and afford return trip.    Tip :- Try booking  flight for 4 PM departure from Katra Helipad and next day around 10 AM  fro Sanjichat to Katra Helipad.   Bookings can be done on only on official website of Vaishno Devi Make sure to carry the debit/credit  card used for booking flight tickets along with ID proof that you have entered while booking ticket - though it was not written on my ticket to carry card but I see people were getting hassled with this on the online ticket verification counter.From this official site, one can also book accommodation- I have booked Vaishnavi Dham accommodation which is 1 KM approx from Sanjichat and 1.5 KM from Bhawan. Considering location an important factor this is best to book . Rooms were large with attached bathroom that give hot water. In case, you have managed to get double bed room and require extra mattress/blanket- this is provided with extra cost at the reception counter.Make sure to obtain Registration slip for first day  with which you can do darshan on first day after checkin to your hotel preferred time after 9 (7-9 is the arti time during which gates are closed) . For next morning, I have booked Atka Arti tickets from official site - that costs 1000 rs per head. Children below 10 years can be accompanied free for arti.Tip:     If you have Atka Arti ticket , you do not require registration slip for next day to do darshan. Tip: When you go first day to bhawan complex for darshan make sure to show the atka arti slip for next day along with ID proofs so that they can confirm your attendance and provide the priority slip along with Sequence No. for sitting to attend arti. This will help save your time next day and you have to just reach the place to be in queue . After doing darshan first time in the evening, we have visited Bhairon mandir and managed to be back in booked accommodation at 1 AM for much needed sleep and to get ready next morning 5:30 AM for Arti which started at 6:10 AM until 8:10 AM.At the end of arti, we had first darshan before the gates get open for other people.Hope you find this useful in planning your visit to Mata Vaishno Devi.Jai mata di!!!"
65,GOOD JAI MATA DI,"If from Delhi - Board Train Shri Shakti which directly takes you to Katra at 5 am in morning. Take a HOtel, get freshen up and after good breakfast start the rejuvenating journey. Don't take stairs else you will feel tired. After around 6 kms, Adkwari cave comes. It will take around 3 hours (Crowd dependent). Take brunch and start again for next around 7kms and your reach Maa Vaishno Bhawan. Take bath, deposit your baggage  in Cloak room and get in the quee and within 1-2 hours you will have darshan of Maa.  After this move to Bhairon Baba temple - 2 kms steep climb. and return. Try choosing a mild temperature day. Good facilities, Try booking room to rest at Bhawan online itself, as physical there may be scarcity. Free Dormitories are available at Manokamna and Parvati guest houses wher also you may change and rest a bit. Total time on average crowd may be around 12 - 14 hours (with family). Try carrying one extra set of cloths if you wish to take bath and change. Helicopter is another option which starts near Railway station and takes your to Sanjhi Chat after which its only 2 kms.JAI MAATA DI"
66,Jai maa vaishno devi,"Its a beautiful city of Mata Vaishno Devi & now after my 1st yatra, i truly believe that Mata beckons her children & make way for them so that they may complete their yatra successfully. The horses/palkis walas or police involved for making yatra easier for yatris are doing a tremendous job which is highly appreciated. But at the same time, the people involved in public transportation esp auto walas charges extremely high and nonsense fares. Few dispensaries on the way to mata temple were seen empty with no doctors/medicines available there. Request to the authorities that they should allow advance reservations or increase booking facilities for Helicopter services & kindly end the system of priority darshan line so that everyone may had the same n equal chance before Mata for darshan."
67,Jai Mata Di,This place is scared place of goddess Vaishnavi. To reach this place you have to reach Jammu and then Katra.Katra to Bhava is some 12-13Km depending on the route you take. Alttude changes for 2500 feet from Katra to 6200 feet at shanjhi chat. Over all you need to have good physic to complete this journey and  when you come back to Katra your leg need some massage and you will find lot of people offering that.
68, Aastha and devotion of Hindus,"We always wanted to have Ardhkuwari Darshan but never made it before this visit due to long queues and waiting time. But this time even when it was a peak time of July, we had been more than lucky to get Darshan   after a wait time of 1 hour only and would like to share #HOW#Trick#1: Just greet and ask fellow yatris who are returning to Katra about the waiting parchi of Ardhkuwari. You will meet a lot of people who have got their parchis but due to the time constraint returning without Darshan.People are happy to share their waiting numbers and till the time you reach Ardhkuwari you will definitely be ahead of many of others.Trick#2: Try your luck by asking people standing for their next call. We met few groups who had entry tickets for more numbers since their turn was next and few members were missing. You can request and join them.Trick#3: What if you return from Bhawan and  your waiting number is gone.

69,Perfect Darshan in hot and crowded June,"Visited the VaishNo devi temple in Jammu with senior citizen and young kids.. opted the helicopter ride which was very comfortable and a Novelty for kidsThe temple is indeed a spiritual experience . Be prepared for super long queues . There are enough joints for food, washrooms etc"
70,Hectic trip if you are planning in June,I have booked double bedded hut at vaishnavi bhawan.So plz can anyone tell me what is the difference between double bedded room and double bedded hut?..and plz also tell where is vaishnavi bhawan and what is the distance between vaishnavi bhawan and main bhawan complex..Thanks in advance
71,Complted the journey from Delhi to Vaishno Devi in less than 36 Hours(without flight or helicopter),"It was a different experience in my life. Whole city of Katra is vibrant with holy chant of Jai Mata Di.We started our climb to holy Mata's temple in morning around 5 am. Every person has to take registration ticket at Katra and keep it safe. This ticket is free of cost and required for entrance to main template.One can take Horse, Pittu and Palaki if they are not willing to go on foot. One can take helicopter for the same.During the way we visited Ardh Kumari. Hanthi maaha, snajhi chhat. At 6 pm. we reached Main temple. After darshan we continue our journey to Bhairab baba. We reached at hotel at next day morning.During the climb and decent, be careful about monkeys. Although they are harmless but they do snatch edibles and prasad.You can get stick at beginning of climb. It is useful in climbing."
72,One of the best temple in Inda.,Religious place for Hindu huge number of people are visiting this mandhir I also visited with my friends....
73,Jai Mata ki,"I visited to Maa Vaishno Devi with my family in June, 2018 which is a peak season due to summer vacations. I have a special place in my heart for this place because the atmosphere is filled with affection of Mata Rani. I feel too happy and satisfied spiritually whenever i visit this charming place. Our trip was really great due to proper planing and advance booking of everything. It was my fifth visit in June, 2018.We booked our train tickets in March when we decided to visit the place. I went through the website of shrine board and understood the rules for online booking of aarti and room at bhawan, which is booked in 2 months advance.We were 6 adults so i booked a four bedded room in gouri bhawan. The room was big enough for 6 people with all the facilities like hot water, clean bed and blankets, almirah, clean bathroom/toilet in room etc. The view of bhawan from our room was really beautiful and fascinating. My parents were  too happy and they thanked me for booking the room at bhawan because there was a huge rush of bhakats in bhawan. there was long queues for bathing, cloak room and mata darshan. But  we had booked our room so we escaped from the long queues.We started our trekking in morning 8 am after light breakfast and we reached bhawan around 2-3 pm as we were taking plenty of rest on the way.we checked in to our room in gouri bhawan and got ready for evening aarti by 6 pm. i had already booked evening attka aarti in two months advance. We went for aarti and it sat in front of mata rani's old cave. The aarti is a divine experience which every bhakt must have whenever they visit. The bhajans of aarti were lovely. Right after the aarti, we had darshan of mata rani without waiting in long queues. When we came outside after darshan , people were waiting in very long queues for their turn of darshan.We took overnight rest in our room and checked out next day morning and proceeded for Bhairo Baba Darshan and came down to our hotel in katra by evening. Next day we visited shivkhodi, baba dhansar waterfall etc.Some advice for devotees:1. Make advance booking of aarti/room at bhawan as per the details on shrine board website. It will be beneficial as u dont have to wait in long queues for cloak room/darshan/bathing.2. No need to book yatra parchi if you have booked attkka aarti.3. take your id proof and debit card in bhawan which you have used for aarti/room booking.4. helicopter booking is better than pony/horse riding as it causes pain in legs. also the prices are also same for both.5. wear shoes for trekking and avoid sleepers/sandles for comfortable treking.6. Drink plenty of waters.7. Dont expect clean washrooms on the way to bhawan due to huge rush in the peak season.8. Bhairo Baba visit is mandatory without which your darshan will be incomplete.9. Take new route for trekking as it is free from horses and very clean and covered in mostly parts and saves us from rain and sunrays.Thanks. Jai Mata Di."
74,Spiritual and Devotional,Blessed. We visited Mata temple and it took 1 hr for darshan from gate. It took 2.5 hrs in horse to climb up and in return we took walk till banganga check post. With the slow pace with family it took 6-7 hrs to come down from bhairavnath temple.
75,Only if you are a devotee,The obvious reason to be Katra is for the visit to Vaishno Devi temple. Was very lucky as there were not many family and people around and hence could to take the blessing of the Godess very peacefully and most importantly unhurriedly.
76,Memorable visit,Jai mata di.we visited mata vaisno Devi ji religious yatra with family. We enjoyed.we feel like we area in heaven. The top of hill situated in katra .very beautiful temple.jai mata di.
77,"Jai Mata Di, A divine place, A family Visit, full of happiness","Visited many times to haridwar but not steped to Katra just 500+ Km by train.In may 12th started From Tiruchirappalli by TEN express reached katra.Himsagar express from trivandraum linked at Erode.rly station reached to yatra Niwas Rs.100/- Dormatory stayed .Received entry pass near the yatra niwas went to hill for dharshan by walk.reached by evening 4.00PM. Around 8.00 Pm returned by horse paid Rs800/- came down. helicaptor, horse , doli available any can choose according to their budget and interest.Near bus stand so many tour operators conduct one day two days tour. Visit and enjoy. My general opinion, those who donot want medicine can perform tour.No mathra (medicine) yatra good. No yatra Mathra (medicine ) good. Choice is yours.Travel in train to enjoy tunnel exits.Explaining the enjoyment through words will give only lesser emotion of joy than that of actual feel."
78,Life time memorable,"2 day trip to Mata Vaishno Devi in December 2017> We started on Friday night (Dec 1st week) from Rajdhani (8:40 PM started on time) and reached katra at 5:15 AM Saturday (before time) > We wasted our 1 hour for private bus (Fare Rs 50-70) which driver was not ready to start until fully occupied; finally we took taxi to katra (Rs 1180 prepaid fixed) and reached katra at 7:30 AM in 70-80 mins> We took a average hotel room in Rs 1000 for a day (starting 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM next day to checkout). Try to take hotel near Katra bus-stand.> We started at 10:15 AM from Ban-ganga(starting point for trek - 12 to 14 km long).> For Pony, Pithoo, Palki the prices are fixed. e.g. For pony Rs 380 to ardhkuwari and Rs700 to Bhawan.> We preferred walking only.> We reached bhawan at 3:15 Pm (in 5 hrs), there is lot of food option in between especially the govt counters(rajma chawal, dosa, vada, tea, colddrink etc at economical price). We took Himkoti way which is easiest & new track and by pass to ardhkuwari> First we took prasad(in jute bag from govt counter) then secondly got freshen up with quick bath in cold water and lastly wasted 30 minute in cloak room queue as you cannot carry anything while doing mata darshan> In 30 mins we did mata darshan as there was no queue.> At 5:00 PM we started for Bhairav baba by foot only(no horse ride) and reached at 6:0 PM (1.5 to 1.8 km steep trek)> In 15 mins we did Bairav baba darshan> At 6:30 we started to get down from old and direct trek to ardhkuwari.> At 10:30 PM we reached banganga and tool auto(Rs 200 prepaid) to katra busstand - 2-3 km away.> In 12 hours we covered Vaishno Devi, Bhairav Baba and back to hotel> Next day at leisure, visited market.> Did luch at Katra bus-stand at sher-e-punjab. Little bit costly with above average food. Try to explore other options.> 4:30 PM took GOVT bus to Jammu (fare Rs 55) very nice & economical bus and I recommend to take govt bus only and reached jammu at 5:30 PM> At station there is jan aahar kendra with good food option, rested there and took rajhani at 7:40PM to return back at delhi at 5:AM on Monday morning> Weather was very nice, neither hot nor cold while going for darshan even in 2017 Dec 1st week"
79,Beautiful temple at a beautiful location but the beauty and sacredness is tarnished by horse men/Pushchair men / porters,Maa vaisno devi durbar situated in Jammu region place called Trikuta Hills went to Durbar for Darshan attended morning and evening Aarti both it was a heavenly experience
80,Wonderful and systematic arrangements for Devotees easy trip....,"People do Yatra for reason so there is nothing to compliant about. I visited Mata vaishno devi in April end with family and 1 year old kid. Here are some tips which i found useful during yatra.1. Pre book your yatra parchi online then you may start yatra anytime during 24 hrs.2. Its better if you start yatra late in the evening and complete it by next morning, then you can avoid sun and heat which will otherwise add to the tiredness. Also you can avoid monkeys during night time.3. If there is no special reason then you must select a suitable time for yatra so as to avoid heavy rush. Avoid weekend and holidays.4. Only limited number of lockers available near bhawan so should take this thing into consideration.5. Taking the new route from ardhkuwari to bhawan will save your time and energy.Thanks."
81,Na Vaishno Devi in Winter ,"Holy SHRINE SMVD is about 56 km from jammu,  i visit SMVD atleast twice a year... Feels good to visit there.... Must visit atleast once in life"
82,Abode of Hindu Faith,"Recently i have visited andaman and my trip start with J hotel..J hotel is near to airport, well cleaned room and washroom, cooperative staff, but apart from that tou wont get good internet facility and specially north indian traveller wont get good taste of food in j hotel restaurant."
83,Family Trip,Jai Mata Di!!I'd get the chance to visit Vaishno Devi temple in November 2018 and I would like to share my experience... Pls avoid getting in que between 6pm to 9pm evening as that's the time of Pooja and Aarti ..I had to wait for lockers for 2 hours and again for 1.5 hour for Darshan..So just as per my experience I would suggest don't get in any que between 6 to 9 pm
84,Vaishno devi ,"We went to Mata Vaishno Devi, Visit was very interesting, owesome tour with friends. we took train from Jammu to Katra. That train tour was some things you will never forget."
85,Things available,"I visited Vaishno Devi after 15 years and this place had undergone a major makeover!!Very helpful policemen who helped us in fixing the price for the horses both ways, ensuring that we are paying the horsemen as per the published rates and asked us to keep their I cards as well. All along the route plenty of eateries, sugar cane juice, tea , coffee, fruit juices available. No need to worry if you forgot your cap, sweater, stroller, baby carrier, rain coats etc home! All available! Everything is very well organized here!! If you feel tired , sit back on the massage chair and let it do its job!!"
86,Great satisfaction. Blissful,Had a wonderful experience while visiting Mata  Vaishno Devi with family. I went after a gap of 5 yeas and was thrilled to see that the Shrine Board has indeed worked for the comfort of the pilgrims on all fronts and work is on to further develop and improve the infrastructure.Attended the beautiful  Atka Arti and got blessing of Mata.Jai Mata Di.
87,Aerial Ropeway to Bhairon ji,"We went in April during Navaratri and the flower decoration all around was so beautiful. We got holy feeling once we see the goddess, the tunnel construction is so cool.But getting there is one hell of a experience. We tried to book helicopters. But the site opened not before 20 days of our journey, and when it did open, it was always failing even after trying so many times, and when we could finally get tickets, it failed in payment gateway. So we could not book online. Later we also tried to get tatkal tickets which are available in Katra, There was lengthy queue just for few tickets available. Dint get there either.So finally we went by walk. Started at 8 in the morning, came back to hotel by 10:00 p.m. Its not that difficult to walk, can take rest every now and then and proceed."
88,Jai Mata Di !!!,Went to vaishno devi mandir located almost 15 km walking distance from the starting of the journey. Finally one can have darshan and pray in the vaishno devi temple and ask for whatever one desire
89,"Wonderful trip, using helicopter, palkhi and pony. Jai Mata Di!","Since we visited in 2nd week of November, we got darshan of main bhavan in 15 mins.We started our yatra at 4pm.Average walking time till Ardhkuwari takes 2hrs 30 mins and horse takes 1hr 30 mins.By 630 pm we reached Ardhkuwari and took our group number.Since our group number was suppose to come by morning 7, we left for bhavan and then shivkhori.Bhavan from ardhkuwari walking time is 1 hr 30 mins , since half of way is plain straight road instead of going upwards.By 11 pm we were done with bhavan and bhairav ghaati darshan.We came down on horses and took a dormitory beds at shailputri bhavan, at ardhkuwari.Since Ardhkuwari is closed for Aarti from 4 to 730 (both morning and evening), we got darshan of ardhkuwari by 11 30 am."

91,Pay your respect to deity,"Vaishno Devi mata's visit was on high priority and finally after 6-7 years of planning we could finally visitwhen did i travel : 2nd week of MarchHow was the trip madeI travelled from Delhi to Katra in train and backI walked up from Katra to the shrine , started walking at around 2 pm , reached by 8 pm. Entire family walked. My 4 year old kid sat on the shoulder of a porter I walked through the new track which comes at half way. New track doesnt have horses coming your way While coming down i had booked helicopter to come down.Things to note :# Eat easy and keep your hydrated. No heavy food recommended# Horses / Pithu (porter) / palki is available from start only. As you start walking up it is available till ardh kuwari (half way through and the rates slowly come down).Remember horses will go through old track only. Others go through new way# There are some pithus who offer support, . whereever you sit for rest , they will give some massage and also push and offer support while walking. Good idea , many recommend though i personally did not use# Please bargain well , though most of them will quote same price.#Take adequate breaks. Towards the end there could be cramps Food availabilityLots of them ... # In katra just near the niharika bhavan and bus stand Jewels dhaba was fantastic# All through the walk there is a lot of outlets and different availability. take only as much water is required. Dont have too much milk. dry food is better# At the top Sagar Ratna beats all. South indian , north indian everything is availableHelicopter is great.. Takes just 5 min - Remember if you booked online the time mentioned in the as departure may not be actual departure. Its first cum first serve basis hence keep buffer time. earlier will help# StayI could get niharika bhavan easily but could get only dormitary in the shrine. Its neatly maintained and not a big issueThe DarshanAn arti is performed each day morning and evening between 6 to 8 . We stood in the line at 7:20 am and got a darshan by 8:30 am ... To finish the entire line and come out it was around 9amGreat darshan ... Divine!!Overall a great trip and such a divine experienceJai Mata Di"
92,14 km decent trek,"We visited the abode of Mata Rani on 21 April 2018 by beginning our journey from Katra at 4pm and reached the Bhawan at night around 11.30 hours. We paid our respect at Baan Ganga, Charu Paduka, Adh Kanwari and reached Bhawan via Himkoti. From Himkoti to Bhawan there are two ways one via Himkoti and other by Hathi Mattha. The way via Hathi Mattha is longer and steep so very difficult. From Adh  kawari  one can also avail Battery Driven Vehicles till Bhawan via Himkolti. It was a wonderful experience as we did Darshan after taking bath at Bathing ghats. Jai Mata Di"
93,Thank you Shri Mata Vaishno Devi ji,"It was a family trip me my husband & daughter.We took Vivek Express (couldn't  get ticket of Swaraj Express,which takes lesser time) from Mumbai & got down at Jammu at 4.00  ,from here we took bus for Katra.There are many option available  from Jammu to Katra.We had already booked Hotel A K International near bus stand at Katra.We started for Temple at 9.00am we went climbing stairs.It was very good experience  but little tiring. While coming back we were very tired.But got darshan very smoothly. Next day we went to Patni to,which is very beautiful place ,since it was March we got snow also.Pic is of Patni top .Subsequently we went to Golden temple & Wagha border. It was very hot there. Entire trip was great experience. Must visit places"
94,Navratri soecial trip,Every Hindu has visited this place. Treaking for 12 km  to reach the bhavan. Although facility like horses and palki are available. In low rush u will find old cave open.
95,Darshan during Navratri,"Recently myself and one of my friend visited the famous Mataji ki Darbar (11/04/2018 to 16/04/2018). Our train was scheduled on 10/04/2018 @11.55 pm (Himgiri Express) from Howrah. But due to Bihar Bandh on the same day, the train reached late at Howrah and departed next day at 10.30 am. So from the starting point itself, it was 10.30 hours late. We were scheduled to reach at Jammu Railway station on 12/04/2016, at around 12.30 pm, but since the train was late, we reached at Jammu Railway station on 13/04/2016, at around 10.30 am"
96,Always feel good on visit,"Great Journey, Great Darshan JAI MATA DI. We are comming from Himachal Pradesh with our family.There is seprate lanes for Ponies and Human so it is clean. U get good refreshments all the way up to bhawan and nice journey. JAI MAA VAISHNO DEVI KI JAI"
97,Mysterious Jewel set in the Trikuta Hills of Jammu Kashmir,We had opportunity to visit maa vaishnodevi temple on April 15 2018..We had heli booking done well in advance ( 60 days before) for both ways..Our slots is 8.30 and return is at 11.45 am...We have to reach the helipad 1 hour before..Please make a note of it..Else you may not be allowed..The heli services are well maintained and you will get your vip darshanam ticket after you come out of your helicopter ..You can directly join gate 5 and have your darshanam quickly..We had a great darshanam . The walk from helipad to temple is easy and you can make it in 20 minutes..Return walk is little bit tough as it is little steep..Over all a great trip !Once in a life  time opportunity for us.
98,Mata Vaishno Devi,the place is very nice divine spiritual. devotee have to walk 13 km from katra to darbar for darshan. the man cart and horses are also available to pick and drop from katra to darbar to and fro. devotee have to take ticket from the shrine board in katra and have to pass lot of security checks. there is garbjun gufa from which the people have to pass.
99,high energy at high altitude,"It gives me great pleasure and inner peace to visit mata vashno devi temple. Dershan is well managed by shrine board. From jammu you can go by road or take a train to karta. The travel time is more if you take a train but it is worth the travel. Tunnels and bridges are worth viewing, a great art of engineering. From katra its a distance of 13 km to bhavan. You can take horse, or walk or take porter to reach bhawan. From adkuwari you can even get a battery car ( timing are from 3 pm to 6 pm) . But getting tickets is difficult. Per person ride is rs 300 from adhkuwari to bhawan. 5 km is covered in just 30 min by battery car. However, walking is an amazing experience. Keep chanting jai mata di on the way and you will get the energy to cover the diatance.During winters climb during the day time and during summer climb during night ( april to oct). One precaution. ..if you are taking poter or horse, note down their registration number so that you can trace them by making announcement incase they move ahead of youJai mata di"
100,Must visit - Jai Mata Diüôè,Must visit pilgrimage once a year.. best part is walking in night hours to reach bhawan in the morning to seek blessings. Shrine board has all the answers for ur needs so you can bank upon all facilities or help that is needed .. advance booking n stay at bhawan is recommended.
101,yearly darshan,We have been to kattra for maa Vaishno Devi darshan and it was so nice to have the blessings of maa on our family and we hope this for all others
102,Jai Mata di !,We stayed at Hotel Rama Trident.The Hotel vehicle picked us from railway station.The hotel is situated in the heart of the city.The hotel has excellent facilities.Rooms are very neatly maintained.Food is very nice
103,Very nice!!,"Went to Mata Vaishno Devi during last Year in May 2015 and enjoy a lot over there during whole yatra. Climate is too good over there and you can enjoy your Yatra with Calling of Mata's name.Best Duration to visit :- Any time during the year, climate is very pleasant over there."
104,How to plan this trip economically and comfortably.,"it was very good experience visiting Vaishno devi , it took 4 hours to reach , all the way good facilities are available. 6pm to 9pm is Aarthi timings so you need to wait during this time so plan accordingly, bhawans are available for stay"
105,Very nice,"Jai Mata di visited vaishno devi temple around 3-4 times first visited in year 2006 again in 2008 n recently in march 2017 after a long gap. We can go main temple by walk or on horse or palki or helicopter as time permits n age. During my last vist we started from katra around early morning 4-5 am by horse's cost was around 800/horse reached in around 2hrs for darshan it took around 1-2hrs n then while going for kalbhairav temple we came across helicopter booking office just enquired whether its available n luckily it was available 1100/head single trip.we were 6 friends.distance from katra to vaishno devi is around 12km. Totally 3 temples to visit aradkuwari temple,maa vaishno devi temple, kalbhairov temple.We planned by flight from Hyderabad to delhi to jammu in jammu did darshan of shiv khori temple n maa vaishno devi temple. Then jammu to Kashmir by flight were around 4-5 days in Kashmir then Kashmir to delhi to Hyderabad."
106,Nothing less than excellent,Vaishno Devi trip I and my family visted the vaishno Devi in katra big mountains and cool breeze many  people visited everyday .
107,the new and improved yatra,We visited this holy temple to get the blessings of the mata.we found this place as in bwtween the mountains and one after lot of walking reach this place and the darshans have a wonderful experience. Will surely visit again.
108,Jai Mata Di,I visited Katra along with my friend in 2015. the place is very nice divine spiritual. Place is very very nice. I loved this place so much. Real natural beauty is here in this place. Temple is nice. One of the best place in India to see.
109,Jai Mata Diii,"19/July'19 : 1.45pm reached Katra Bus stop from SrinagarI had a train to catch at 11.05 from Katra so had about 10hrs to complete the yatra.After registration parchi I reached Banganga start point and started the yatra at 2.05pm on foot. Because I was determined so I left it to God to oversee my yatra and ensure my darshan. To save on time I took the steps but at a slow pace. While I will not recommend regular pilgrims to take the stairs but to walk. I took the old route and reached Bhawan @ 5.30pm. then went to Kalika Bhawan and took the waiting room and cleaned myself, changed and rushed to the darshan line @ 6.07pm.This time was the Evening Aarti time but our batch was the last one to be allowed the darshan and I had the divine darshan at 6.37pm. Ropeway to Bhairon Mandir closes @ 7.00pm.After the darshan and rest I started the return journey at 7.30pm and reached Banganga at 10.15pm well in-time to catch my trainIt was a journey which seemed kind of impossible to start with but made easy by determination and yearning to have the divine darshan.Jai Mata Di"
110,Religious place,"Hey friends I'm jay and I have visited the vaisnodevi temple in jammu and Kashmir and it's was very enjoyable movement I have visited with my friendsüë≠üë¨üë´ there are many services provided by them to climb on the top you can reach there by ropeway, helicopter, horse, etc. But the best experience is of walking with our groups. We have started climbing on early morningüåÑüôã and the sun rise when you see it it's the best experience in the whole life. You must visit there once in life."
111,Jai Mata Di,"I am  coming to Mata rani since last 10 years and every year I see new development and facilities for the devotees , ht management have done a commendable job this time for providing full shelter for the pilgrims from katra , earlier during rainy season , we used to face lots of difficulties , now proper shade have been made and the entire stretch is made of concrete for the comfort of pilgrims , proper lightning, discounted meals after every half a kilometer is remarkable !!! They have made Yatra parcies which controls the crowd during peak season , hats off to management for making this tough yatra so easy and comfortable .It is one of the most famous thirth of Hindus and I have seen those who have visited have never came back empty hands !!!JAI MATA DI!"
112,An unparalleled Pilgrimage ,It always feel great to vist the Vaishno Devi Mandir. The place is now very well managed by the trust. It becomes very crowded during major festivals and Holiday season.
113,Spriitual solace,"Visited Mata Vaishno Devi shrine after a long time and had a very spiritually satisfying experience. There is a lot of improvement in infrastructure and facilities at base camp Katra as well as on the track to the Bhawan. However, queue management at the Bhawan needs improvement. New additions like battery operated vehicles and Helicopter service has made the journey easy for those who cannot climb over 13 kms trek. Overall it is a must make pilgrimage. Jai Mata Di."
114,NOT TO BE MISSED PLEASE VISIT DURING LIFETIME,"visited with family, up till bhairo and return back to katra. Take horse or mule during upward journey. as return will cause jurk in the back,"
115,Awesome,"A pious place on ""Trikuta"" mountain ""Maa Vaishno Devi"" temple. This temple really connect you with goddes Vaishno. A 13-14 KM height tracking with a single slogan from every ones mouth ""Prem se bolo Jai Mata Di"", gives you courage and strength and it feels like some one is pulling you towards the temple. At ""Ardha Kumari"" the ""Garbhajune Cave"" and at the top of the pick the ""Bhairawa"" temple make you realization of god on the earth. The Scenario in the morning, the sun rise from the hills of Himalaya, from the ""Bhairawa"" temple make you mesmerize. A bath in the waterfall of ""Vanganga""  gives relief from the pain during the journey."
116,Beautiful,The saying that you can visit Vaishnov Devi Temple if you receive a calling from Ma is so true couldn't believe as from bookings to Walking the difficult terrain to Darshan to stay to meals it seemed Ma is holding and guiding through the whole thing . There are options to take the pony or helicopter to Sanjichat ( weather dependent) but we walked the whole path from Katra to Ardakuwari to Bhawan . If you can manage to take the steps enroute to Bhawan you would reach faster but yeah it would test your fitness levels should be over 6000 steps or so . The walk fromKatra to Bhawan is longer if one uses the pathways  built . There is also battery car from Ardhakuwari to Bhawan very effectient and cheap Rs 300 faster way to reach say 30 mins compared to hours of walk . As mentioned before helicopter is another mode katra to sanjichat in 7 mins and another 30 mins by pony you are at Bhawan good for the elderly . You can miss bhairav after visiting the shrine as per Partha steps are fast but pony longer via sanjichat .The accommodation is good at Kalika Bhawan and Niharika respectively . If you take the Shradha Suman Vishesh Puja ( limited ) apart from Darshan / Aarti in the old sanctum also accommodation and food . Apart from this there is limited Aarti tickets you can attend the Aarti . Normal Darshan is a bit longer and depending on the crowd queue could be Long . Jan- March winter time less crowd nice time to visit . All throughout the year there are visitors to the Shrine . Jai Mata Di
117,Vaishno Devi Mandir  Jammu City  Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Darshan a fulfilling experience,It was really a great place to go.... I blessed this holy cave darshan yesterday on 03 March 2017 with my wife & son and it's really given me a peace...
118,It was a great experience going for Darshan of the natural pindies of Mata Vaishno Devi throgh the old natural cave.,"Had a wonderful yatra of Vaishnodevi temple from katra in july 2018.During this time,due to bad weather,heli services are often cancelled.Electric cars have to be booked well in advance as they are in limited number.Pony or walking distance one way is 113kms-the path is paved at most places & covered.best time to visit would be september/october with moderate weather & less crowd."
119,Divine,It is a very nice experience to visit  Maata Vaishnodevi.When we were there that is on 9th& 10th July there was curfew in Srinagar.but by the grace of Maa. Vaishnodevi only we went Amarnath on 12th July .So if  Maa permits again we want to visit Maa Vaishnodevi
120,Details of tour for 1st timer.. Awesome unique experience.,"You have trek 14 kms to get the darshan of Mata... There are lot facilities available while trekking, so it is your choice which you prefer..but ultimately walking 14 kms is a divine pleasure... After reaching holy cave you can get good darshan of Mata devi.. Vaishno devi is Moonh Maangi Muradein Poori Karne Wali Mata.. About 1.5 kms from Bhawan you can also have darshan of Bhairo Baba and then trek down to your respective places..."
121,An advise as per my experience,"To reach Vaishno Devi, you need to reach Katra which is a 2 hour drive from Jammu. We visited the the vaishno devi bhavan in January. Modes of Transport to reach the bhavan :- Helicopter, Rickshaw(for senior), Horses, Palki, Pitthu(they take care of kids and carry them, they are very caring and safe), Stairs and the ultimate is the WALK(Trekking) - It took us 19000 some steps to reach the bhavan in 5 hours and 30 mins, where we skipped ardhkuwai. There are two roads to reach the bhavan if you are on the horse the route is different from ardhkuwari and if you are walking the route is different. The new route is a km less then the old route which the route taken by the horses. If you walking make sure you do not take that route! Started walking in the night and returned via horses in the morning! Horses were a bad idea to come down on, would suggest to take horses up and come down walking.  The walk till ardhkuwari is a bit difficult. There are plenty of shops and massage places during the walk. And you will also find people to massage you in the middle of no where. They don't charge too much. The safety of the people is a top priority. They have medical facilities at almost every check point! Also they have locker, rooms  facility once you reach the bhavan. The Vaishnodevi trust have also started a website from where you can book tickets and all. Would definitely recommend all to atleast visit vaishno devi once in a lifetime. JAI MATA DI."
122,Divine..,Went to vaishno devi with family and had a good time. Everyone enchants JAI MATA DI to each other whether they know one another or unknown.  While upward journey takes a bit more time than downward. There was a huge queue even at 11 pm in morning when we reached bhawan. It was raining heavily but still it felt good after wearing the plastic sheets. Must go
123,Excellent Trip with family,Many times we come to mata vaishno devi ji  darbar. We feel like we are in heaven.Jai mata di jai mata di jai mata di jai mata di
124,Trip of vaishno devi,"We had a very good experience. We traveled from Delhi to Katra by train. Definitely this must be topping the well organised temples in India. Well maintained premises and the pathway & safe for travelers to walk. The whole trip from Katra to the template and all the way back was very pleasant.Excited to remember we have used all modes of transport from our home @ Delhi to the template and way back home - Car, Delhi Metro, Train, Taxi, Helicopter, Ponis and ofcourse by Walk. Absolutely a memorable experience."
125,Jai Mata Di,True one can visit mata(mother) temple for darshan only if she blesses. I happened to be there the day it was raining heavily and my helicopter at 2.00 pm was postponed and only by chance it took us on hill top at 5.30. The rains and storms continued and I returned amidst stormy wheather all wet but it was worth.
126,Greatest Hindu Shrine,Too good experience. Went at Mandir by walking was an unforgettable experience of life. Jai Mata Di.
127,Jai mata di,Traveling in a train from Bandra terminus to Katra station was tiring but on our way to Katra city it was mesmerizing to watch the lights shining on the mountain. After reaching Katra we rested overnight and began our journey to Vaishno Devi next morning. It took us 3 hrs to reach the top peak and it was a great experience. While getting down it was an emotional experience as we were heading back home. The overall experience was great.
128,Family trip,Visited Mata Vaishno Devi shrine. There was huge rush of devotees due to summer vacation of kids.We had good Darshan and attended Evening Arti. It was sacred moment. It's best to visit during weekdays to have peaceful Darshan.
129,The supreme power pulled us,I have been a regular visitor to Mata vaishno devi cave. The place is really very beautiful and holy place. I feel a peace of mind while i have been there.   Jai Mata Di
130,Jai Mata Di,"We visited Katra, Vaishno Devi and we had a memorable experience.The only thing I was not happy was for the restaurantsThis place have some good restaurants only but if I are visiting you should easy you can eat in your hotel or Sagar Ratna , Dominos pizza(No onion,No garlic)Other than this everything was good!!"
131,Awesome divine.,This was my third visit to Mata Vaishno Devi Mandir. Our journey was really enjoyable with family.We started 11 am on 9th of June and reached bhavan by 4 pm. This time we cover our yatra by pithoos.They charged 800 per person till bhawan and then 400 till bhairon mandir.Then after darshan we started our back journey to our hotel and reached by 8pm to the Darshani Darwaja.
132,Jai mata ki,"One of the good places to live is Mangal Bhawan which is a new Dharamshala with price of rooms between Rs 800-1000. They will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner at defined timings. Rooms are spacious and bathroom clean. Rates of auto are fixed between Rs 100-200 wherever you go. You can get helicopter tickets from current booking at Niharika complex. The charge is Rs 1005 per person one side. It's better you do online booking. It's around 2kms walk from Sanjhi chat where helicopter drops to main bhawan. You can take mule for kids and palki for elderly people. After darshan you can have food at sagar ratna which offers good food or rajma rice at local restaurants. It's around 30-40 mins up hill walk to Bharon Mandir. Be careful of monkeys there. Either you can take helicopter both way or can come down walking which takes around 2 hours or can hire mule which will charge roughly Rs 500 per person. Waiting time at ardhkwari is roughly 4-5 hours. Either you book it while going upwards and can attend while coming back. Katra is completely safe and path to main bhawan is all cemented and totally covered. While returning you can have food at IRCTC food Plaza at railway station which serves great food. Finally you can visit this place only when there is order from Mata. Pls like if you found this useful."
133,a spiritual journey one cannot explain. waiting to go back sometime in 2019.,I visited the Holi shrine after a long gap of 10 years and found peace and happiness at the temple.We were lucky to have got no rush at the temple and got ample time for the darshan.The shrine board is upgrading the infrastructure for the pilgrims which is really appreciable.
134,Visit vaishnodevi via new Tarakote route,its was better experience where we enjoyed alot because of the environment and darbar of mata vaishno devi
135,fantastic experience,"Jai Mata DiWe visited on March 12th,2017 reached katra by 11th night and had initially a plan of trekking overnight.But wife got very high fever and severe vomiting & it seemed impossible to even start the yatra. We thought of returning back in morning.Still we both prayed whole night to Mata Rani and in morning somehow got strength and we both woke up and started for yatra.Thanks Mata for giving us energy(shakti) and giving us darshan. Looking at last nights condition preferred going by horse upwards.Reached Bhawan at around 11 am by starting at 8:30am.Lines for keeping luggage were more long then even darshan's queue.Got a good darshan of Mata and returned back by Helicopter.Service is good.Even though we were late by 1Hr. still there was no hussle.Thanks to shrine board for maintaining all facilities in a proper way."
136,Holy visit,"it is a nice temple being sakthi peetam and one must definitely visit. good arrangements for darshan.one can go by walk as the roads are very clean nice secured and no fear.well lit throughout in the night also. horses and doli are available.one has to be careful while using horse especialla while climbing down.horse is cheaper than doli which is expensive.facilities like food water et resting plae are available through the stretch of 12.5 km.throughout it is fenced with thick steel wire mesh and so youare very securedwhile going in horse or in doli. one can safely take a trip[. helicopter is available on line bookince  two months before your actual day of visit. this is  difficult. they should arrange on spot helicopter available for those who could not do it in advance.this will be a great help.pilgrims are advised not to carry anything with them in leather like wallet, belts, not even a bag as it is not allowed. to put in cloakroom one has to wander and time consuming. be prepared before going not to take anything except your pass for temple, helicopter tkt, id cards, cash.geneeral security is good.no untowards incidents are  experienced by me.arrangements are superb by the temple authorities. avoid cameras asnd cell phone while going for darshan (not allowed) or else cloak it"
137,Awesome visit,"Am a regular goer to Mata Vaishno Devi temple. The place is simply divine and draws you like a magnet there, you go once with full devotion, you will feel like going again and again. I visit once every 3 months. the overall environment is so beautiful and mesmerizing."
138,JAI MATA DI,"After 20 years I was able to go to mata's darbar , and it would not be possible without maa's blessings. Had lovely darshan despite being peak season."
139,new track.. awsmm.. ,"It was my 4th visit to Vaishno Mata Mandir and every time I visit Mata's Darbar, I see something new. New construction taking place, new modes of taking people to the top etc. The trek from Katra to Bhawan is 14 km, which can be covered in 3-4 hrs. at moderate speed. One piece of advice would be to the visitors who're either travelling with a senior citizen or somebody who needs palanquins or ponies to go up. Do speak to authorities with a red tag with ""Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board"" embedded as they very strictly make the service providers adhere to their pre-determined standard rates because this menace of haggling you are bound to face at Katra where ponies/palanquins will ask for 4-5 times of the standard tariff. A great initiative by the board is they have started CNG taxi service from Ardh Kuwari to Bhawan at 300/head but it is strictly for Sr. citizens or someone in need (though one additional person can avail too as attendant). Apart from a few little things, you won't face any challenges during your trip because of the VD administration which is doing its job pretty well. Jai Mata Di!"
140,Jai mata di,Mata Vaishno devi darshan is always a blessing. Shrine board has made a fantastic arrangement on the way by providing almost complete shades and water. However pony riders will charge you anything so please take it from authentic places. You can also take part of evening aarti for which receipt is 1000/- Rs which starts at 7:20 PM in evening. The receipt will be available from room no 8 & entry is from gate no 2. Go early to take 'Aarti Parchi' since only 50 receipts/Parchi' distributed every day.Jai Mata Di
141,Jai Mata Di!,"This is my third instance to visit Mata Vaishano Devi Holy Shrine.  We had a great Yatra this time.  We hired Ponies this time and completed entire Yatra, including Bhairavnath but excluding Adkuwari, in less than 12 hours.  The climate was too cool, temp. around 5 to 6 Dec. C.  Due to Christmas Vacation there was long que.  But still we had completed the Darshan within 1 to 2 hrs. time."
142,JAI MATA DI,Must walk till bhairon baba and avoid ponnies if you can. The real pleasure is in the completion of journey . Must do it once
143,Challenging,Vaishno devi temple management is not very good and during journey you will feel. You will feel like why you came here to suffer alot.But as I mentioned that if you have faith in mata than these sufferings will go away an you will really feel refreshed here.From wherever pilgrims are coming they First halt at karta to refresh themselves before start of journey Hotels/ lodges charge 400 to 600 per room for 3-4 hours..they claim that water is so costly there that is why cost is very high.Now from karta you have to move to banganga.Remember to take Yatra parchi from karta or online because this parchi is required to be shown at banganga check point and again at  temple entry point for darshan.From banganga to temple distance is approx 12kmThis distance can be divided in two stages First distance of 6.5 kms from banganga check point to cross road for ardhkuwari Second distance of 5.5 from cross road of ardhkuwari to temple.First part of travel is really bad.  Ponies people and palkiwala all going through same road. The moment you cross banganga check post you will get very bad smell of ponies. This smell continues till you complete you first part.Everytime you have to give way to ponies and palkiwalas who keeps shouting from behind.Good things is that after every 1km you will find free toilets which are reasonably clean.There are drinking water points are also there prefer to take mineral water from shops.During first part of journey you will find shops on the both sides. Road is not clean so must dust everywhere After first phase there are two roads to reach bhawan first via hathimata marg which is old road and similar to first part road. Must avoid this roadSecond via Himkoti marg choose this road only. This will be your second phase of journey Second part of journey is really smooth. Roads are well laid out and are clean. Ponies go through old road therefore journey becomes really easy. Roads are covered with shed so it saves from direct sun light. You will feel cold breeze which also refreshes the mood.In this journey You will find some eating outlets of trust on the way..food is not that good you will find only rajma rice kadhi chawal and poori channa option.So I would suggest not to try these and take only packed juice and lassi and tea.After reaching temple you may have to face long queue for darshan. We were lucky as we had contacts in police which helped us for direct darshan. So if you also have must use that otherwise this queue may take 3-4 hours as people told us.Here near temple only few accommodation are there which always remains full..therefore You will have to sleep on any corner you find anywhere..You will people sleeping everywhere in nightYou can get blanket for Rs100 which is refundable when you return it but getting this blanket and returning it is also annoying as you may have to face queue again.For bath there is option near temple but it is also not maintained..but still you may enjoy open bath with cold water with lot of other peopleNote: Other than by walk there are multiple other options to reach banganga to temple.1 Helicopter Rs 1175 one side advance booking needs to be done online 2 Ponies charge approx Rs 700 one side3 Palkiwalas charge Rs 4000 for both side.4 In second part of journey auto is also available for Rs 300 one sideI have also uploaded Multiple helpful pictures which may help first time visitors.
144,Very fresh climate and super temple,I want to visit vaishno temple with my 6 months daughter and my wife.so please tell me is it comfortable with baby
145,Prem se bolo Jay Mata di..,"We stayed at a hotel in Ban ganga road and reached the main entrance through hotel vehicle. Initially there is a security check to check bags and yatra slips. I booked the yatra slips Online, hence saved some time to register at yatra counter in Katra. Carry multiple copies of Yatra slip, if you booked it online. Since the queues are separate for Ladies and gents, hence its easy if each carry separate slips. At the entrance many Ponywallahs, will be irritating you with various pricing and packages. Just ignore all of them, you can take pony easily from inside the pathway. We walked some 100 to 200 meters inside and took pony till Adhkawari. There is a board outside the temple with fixed pricing for Pony and Palki. So use this board for the pricing, no negotiations strictly refer to this pricing. From Adhkawari we took Electric car, it took about 45 mins in the queue to get the booking. We had 2 elders, but they mentioned they will only allow people who are older than 65 years of age. Later agreed to give tickets for all of us. If you have any medical conditions, please carry prescriptions, so that they give the tickets easily. It costs around 300 INR per person to go up and 200 INR to come down. Once you reach the top there are total 3 lockers to leave your baggages, mobiles, cameras. I left it locker 1 itself. Just before the entry to main queue to go towards the main temple, one can leave the shoes and sandls in the stand. Darshan was very quick, since there was not much crowd when I went. Everything went fine for us. While returning we walked till Adhkawari and then took pony back to ground.Points to consider:Carry water, nuts, cookies, etc and carry less.Food and other stuffs available everywhere on the way.Medical dispensary also available on the way, if you need some attention.entire route is covered with shades, so its safe and easy."
146,Jai mata di.,"Very famous temple of Maa, many of peoples come here every year from all over India.I went here for Darshan of Maa with my family."
147,Blessed,"I really luck, because i am not plan to visit vaishnavi devi temple.After completion of darshanam i really happy and enjoy the trip to katra. I first time travel by helicopter to mata vaishnodevi temple."
148,Lot of aastha ,Vaishno devi temple is situated in katra. I visited there last month. That was awesome place. It is religious place. In the month of April there were too much crowd.
149,Most holiest shrine of Maa Vaishno,We often go to every year for darshan of Shri Mata Vaishnodevi. we found it in every respect neat  and clean  Shrine.
150,Maa ka Ghar,"Went to Shrine in the month of May via Delhi 2016 and reached hassle free with toddlers into. It was a nice Horse -ride to mountain, however Parents had hard time riding Horses which literally run on mountain on the way-up and down.  It got cooler once you reach up , but gets crowded like anything for darshan , Military People taking care of discipline come along as rudest though and don't care the state of tired people.  Everything else is nice."
151,Ardour walk,it was a very peaceful journey ...i visited here 2nd time after 10 years and now with my family .....and what i find everything was changed and developed ....it was nice to see everthing ....we had a very pleasant and peaceful dharshan ......jai mata di !
152,Holly Trip,"Its a 14 Km from katra, there are many different ways to reach the temple. But i prefer walking up the place. Many places to stay and food along the way. Always crowded."
153,Visit Via Helicopter During Navratra - Imp Things of Note,"We visited Vaishnodevi Mata Shrine on 20-21 Aug. Helicopter got cancelled due to bad weather so had to book a horse.  Horse charges you double. Not advisable to take horse as they slip due to rain.  Better to check the helicopter availability. Carry ponchos. If you are walking take the new route which is open and generally not in use so very empty. It is steep as well so take breaks in between. It‚Äôs good to book a room in the bhawan for a quick shower and relaxation before you head out for the darshan. The crowd is managed very well by Army. Shops, horses, pitthus have become more commercial and have pricy. The cable cars from bhawan to Bhairon Baba hasn‚Äôt opened yet and is under testing. Expected to open in some months, sorry not sure about the timing.   Jai Mata Di"
154,Jai Mata Di Darshan in one day!!,"I flew from  South Africa , via Dubai to Mumbai. from Mumbai to Jammu. stayed in Jammu on the day of arrival and the next day took a taxi to my accommodation in Katra. Completed the entire yatra .The journey was an experience one cannot explain. All I can say is that I want to go back this year as well."
155,Jai Mata Di,Had visited vaishno devi 2 times and both the time my experience was very good.. so peaceful.. jai mata di...!!!
156,Visit to Vaishno Devi,"I went for a pilgrimage to Mata Vaishno Devi alongwith my family in the month of June.  The weather was awesome, it was drizzling for three days.  We were blessed to have smooth darshan of Mata Vaishno Devi."
157,Jai Mata Di,"I with my wife visited the temple in November 2016. We had booked a hotel in Katra in the from slot 6 am to 12 pm. This is a very good option you can avail , so you can select the number of hours you wish to stay and don't have to pay the full price of 1 day.We started somewhere around 1 pm and completed the journey in around 4 hours. We also booked a room at bhawan which was not very far from the Darbar.I would strongly recommend to book a room at the top if you are travelling with family.  Booking can be done from the website. We had a great darshan around 10:00 pm. Next morning we went to the Bhairo baba darshan.It was a great experience."
158,A divine lifetime experience. A must visim,"We went there in the month of june & there was horrifying crowd.Jammu railway station was very unmanaged.We took a bus and reached there by evening,hotels are on very dirty places but are OK.In the way to bhawan there are many places which give you excellent scene of Katra valley but sometimes that joy is spoiled due to crowd.Bathing facility is very bad.Bhairon mandir is fool of sceinic beauty.We went Katra railway station and was amazing,clean & well maintained place.....Altough our trip was OK.Recomment everyone to go there but not in month of June."
159,Vaishno Devi Mandir,"Katra  (Vaishno Devi ) is a 1 hr drive from jammu city although by bus it might take u 2 hrs. Once u reach katra U need to purchase passes for the darshan and reach banganga from where the climb starts. It's approximately 6 km uphill walk from banganga to ardh kuwari (half way) and another 6 km to the Bhavan (main temple). It should take about 5 to 6 hrs to reach. On the way there r lots of rest points, tea coffee snaks joints and view points. U can  get accommodation there at the bhawan but it is usually full so should be pre booked. The darshan might take u around 2- 3 hrs depending on the passes u have a number of ppl. Locker facility is also available at the Bhavan where u might want to keep ur valuables, shoes, mobiles, leather items etc. Once u reach the main temple the atmosphere , the peace it's  just mesmerising.. hope u have great trip . JAI MATA DI"
160,No offense to mata jiüôèüôèüôè,Mata Vaishno Devi is one of the best holy place in the world..  I go there every year...  I love this place...  Jaimata Mata di
161,Divine Shrine,Went in the month of july'16. Since the train service is now started it has become very easy to reach karta from any part of the country.The newly built railway station is high tech and staff over there is very friendly. We book the irctc tourism hotel which situated in the railway station building only. It's very neat and clean. They provide pick up and drop facility also to ban ganga from where the holy trip to vaishno Devi begins.Over all the city is developing fast... And it's very clean. People are also friendly.
162,VAISHNODEVI TEMPLE YATRA,"Here, it is said mata vaishno Devi came and resided before killing bhairon baba. One feels an energy circulation as and when a person enters the premises of the district. The person starts chanting Jai mata di automatically. It is a must visit place as and when one comes to J&K as many times in his/her lifetime."
163,This time via new route,"We went here to get some blessings of Mata Vaishno Devi. The place is so beautiful and spiritual. People from every state come here. You have to climb up a steep path. Some stairs are also there. You can hire ponies or palanquin as well. When you reach the top, your all the worries get vanished. Nothing to worry about food.  Good food is available there."
164,Vaishno Devi Walk - August 18,"We have been in a family trip to Vaishno devi on 3rd week in February. After keeping our luggeges in our hotel, we start for Vaishno devi in the early morning at around 6-6.30 am. The road are less crowded and the weather was also pleasant. My husband reached the Vaishno devi at around same time we reached there by pony. Though he took limited stoppage in between. With the pony owner you have to bargain and if your luck was there then you can get one way for around 600 in off-season. During season they want more. In all the trip was nice. During returning it took around 3-4 hrs with adequate break. But try to avoid stairs though it look easy and shortcut. If you use stairs the after sequence will be more painful as it affects muscle of the legs more according to my observation. Through out the journey the paths are almost shaded, therefore no need to carry umbrella. Carry only a glass or empty bottle as there are many dhabas and water filters available within the path. What amazed me is the sound system (BOSE), throughout the path where always some announcement or songs are going on. It has been a nice journey, will plan again.Jai Mata Di."
165,Jai Mata Di,"Went to Mata Vaishno Devi temple not just as a devotee but as a traveler. The place gives you an amazing experience. It is one of best maintained religious place. And after opening of new route (no ponies allowed on new route) it has added on to cleanliness. The place can be reached by bus and train till Katra and nearest airport is Jammu.The full trail till bhavan is 12kms. Both the paths are cemented and there are stairs also on the old route. There are no of dhabas and food joints along the route including bhojanalayas opened by the shrine board. There are also a no of viewpoints enroute to enjoy the beauty of Trikuta parvat , valley and picturesque lighting of Katra city. The bhavan itself looked amazing at night due to lightning. P.s couldn't go till Bhairav temple due to lack of time."
166,Jai Shri Mata Vaishno.,"With the blessing of Mata Vaishno devi, we arrived at her temple, the journey was a full day long, walking and on horses, with going up on the mountains and thin clouds and air roaming around you, was a very holy experience."
167,Jai Mata Di!,"Hi this is Raghunandan from hyderabad AP want to share my experience of Maa vaishno Devi Darshan Katra.First of all i would thank tripadvisor website and their review posters, with their posts and reviews only i completed my trip successfully.I have started my journey from delhi-haridwar-rishikesh-kedarnath-rishikesh-Vaishno Devi katra-delhi in JUNE-2017.After completing my haridwar-rishikesh-Kedarnath tour, I headed to Maa Vaishno Devi from Rishikesh(Direct Train from Rishikesh) i have started around 04pm climate was good.

168,Jai Mata Di,A divine place like Shri Mata Vaishno Devi comes with a feelings of at most devotion  hence makes it heaven for the devotees.Beautiful place. A trek which can be covered in a single day. For people who are not comfortable with trekking can opt for alternatives like helicopter etc. Always try to stay for a night at the place. Book room in advance and experience the best of this place.
169,Excellent Darshan,Been Vaishno Devi as a kid. While my dad was posted in Jammu it was an annual activity to visit the Holiest Shrine in Northern India. The walk was just awesome and the site from above was mesmerising.
170,Blessing ,"JAI MATA DI...I visited Vaishno devi in February 2019. This was my 1st visit. We went in group which was pre -booked in month of Nov 2018.... I was very lucky enough to have got the opportunity to visit such a holy place.We went by train which was one & half days journey.. We got down at Katra railway station.. one of the beautiful station,We stayed at Hotel Sri Palace.. a good hotel.We started our journey at 7 am .. One has to take Yatra Parchi from Ban-ganga & then only one can proceed.. there are 2 ways to proceed.. one is old way which is also used by horses & palkhis.. other is the new way which is only for walking travellers.... but its 2.5- 3 kms long.. One can also take horse from Banganga to Ardh Kuwari or a Palkhi.We proceeded walking from the old way... first we went to Ardh kuwari we reached there at 10.30 am. One has to take token no. over there. Many people skip this darshan as there's a big queue & it takes lots of time....but I will highly recommend it as its very very old holy cave (gufa) of Mata where Mata meditated or did tapacharya for 9 mths.... its something different & out of the world experience & very adventurous too... it took us 3 hrs for the darshan..Again from Ardh Kuwari to Bhawan there are 2 ways.. one is Himat koti Marg & other is Hathi Marg... Hathi Margh is very steepy & sloppy to walk.We took Himkoti Marg to proceed to Bhawan.. one can also take battery cars to reach Bhawan from Ardh Kuwari.. We proceed by walking & reached Bhawan at 4.30 pm.. by 5.00 pm we got the darshan.. after Mata Vaishno devi darshan its very important to take Bhairo baba darshan. Now rope way has also started from Bhawan to Bhairo nath so it has become easy to reach there.. But rope way is available till 4 pm only..We again proceeded by walking to Bhairo nath which is 3 km from bhawan.. but the way is very difficult & tirring as its very narrow, steepy & sloppy to walk & was full of snow.. one can also hire horse to reach Bhairo nath. It took us 1 hr to reach Bhairo nath.. Be aware of monkeys as they snatch away prasad bag..After trekking all the way from Ban Ganga to highest temple of Bhairo baba on Trikuta parvat it becomes very very difficult to walk down so I recommend to take horse to come down the mountain..There is very good facilities of clean toilets & refreshments in the whole way to Bhawan... Its very lucky & unique experience to get darshan of all the 3 main temples at Vaishnodevi..Don't forget to click awesome pics with different props at studios available on the way to Vaishnodevi.Its very chilling cold over there so carry enough warm clothes.Helicopter facility is also available which has to be pre-booked online 1 month before the visit.. Jai Mata Di..."
171,Developing & better pilgrimage,"Have visited VaishnoDevi temple many times and each time I feel overwhelmed and very emotional ... Good facilities on the way , beautiful view from Trikuta hills and you feel the enthusiasm among scores of people visiting the temple ."

Since my childhood i am visiting and whenever i am in Pain i am trying to reduce my pain while visiting Mata Ka Mandir..
173,JAY MATA DI,"It took me 5.5 Hrs to reach main temple from the foothill by walk. I must appreciate Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Trust for providing excellent facilities to the devotees. They have provided bench / chairs all along the path of 11.50 Km stretch. The path is covered with GC sheet roofing. Drinking water booths, tea stall, juice centres are all available along the path. There are food stalls also after short distances. They have dispensaries / stretchers all along the path. Battery operated cart / e-rickshaws are also available from Km 5.0 (Adhkuwari) for senior citizens, differently abled persons, children etc. for a price. There are no pandas inside the temple & Pujaris wont ask you for any money. The view of Katra Town is spectacular from the top. Palkis (palanquin), Pony rides are available. There are licenced porters to carry one's luggage with a reasonable price. It is advised to wear shoes & loose cloths for comfort."
174,Jai mata di,"The Divine Journey from the Ban ganga to the Holy Shrine, very well maintained by Shrine Board , one can travel by foot or take a pony or a Helicopter to hop till Sanjichath  ."
175,Jai Mata Di,Everything is ok. Weather is to good Katra  bus Station to mata vaishno dwvi mandi 9 to 10 km all facilities provided near by helipad and provide mini autoNice place and good facilities Jai mata di
176,Awesome,"The pilgrimage to the main shrine from the main entrance is of 13 km and to Bhairon Ghati is 14.5 Km. I went there in Jan, on 26th Jan, 2017, when we reached Katra, it was raining heavily and still, we had no other option but to continue the journey, we started at 3:30 pm from the main gate and reached the bhawan at 7:30 pm. The weather was quite windy, rainy and really cold. We had the Darshan, in the night at 11 pm and continued toward Bhairon in the night, you will hear rumors about, Lions and other wild animals, please ignore them and continue the journey with the name of Jai Mata Di. In less than 12 hours we completed our whole yatra and left from Jammu. It gets really, magnificent in the morning to see the sunrise from Bhairon Ghat and the view of Snow capped Shivaliks from there."
177,"One of the holiest places to visit for Hindus, but stay is an issue.","This was my second visit to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Temple with my wife and daughter. We started early morning at 6:00hrs from the hotel. On reaching Banganga check post we got ourselves scanned and frisked to ensure we don't carry anything objectionable.We started our journey at 6:30 hrs followed by intermediate halts at Juice shop that offers sugarcane juice. Its totally refreshing and maintains body sugar levels during the journey. Make sure you are reasonably slow and take baby steps while on a steep ascent to avoid getting exhausted immediately. Never take steps as this will burn out all the energy within you. The walk uphill took us almost 6.5 hrs to reach the temple.  On reaching the temple area we deposited our mobile phone and shoes in a locker provided free of cost. Later we joined the queue for getting a divine sight of Mata Vaishno Devi. There was a bit of rush as it was Navratri Season. After completing our visit to Temple we walked down hill with intermittent halts at different cafeterias.  The entire journey took us almost 13hrs and by then we were totally exhausted and drained of all physical strength but full of accomplishment of having successfully completed the journey by Walk. May God Bless Us with Physical, Mental strength for another journey in future.."
178,Religious visit,I really like vaishnodevi the place was just amazing because it is religious place and also loved by every one I can travel there and really a nice place where we can live and delight food and just amazing facility the place was also good the safety is also measure in these place because it is placed which is loved by everyone and accebility also good my favorite temple and it is just amazing the hotels are really great because facility is also good and the place where everyone can travel 365 days because a lovely place to go.
179,Visit to holy shrine,"You need to register at Niharika Bus Stand, Katra, Jammu.  The trip from Delhi to Katra takes 15 hours and no alcohol/non-veg is permitted at Katra.  The lunch at Katra was average.  Me and my family decided to go by foot and a stick is a must even for the stout person.  The trek takes 15 to 20 hours for ardha kumari waiting.  The path is spacious and well maintained but you have to trudge 25 kms on foot.  The staff is courteous and there are a variety of services on offer like food, restrooms and lodging at reasonable prices.  However, one is really tired at the end. Also, at the gate, touts and beggers need to be taken care of.The darshan line time varies and like all popular temples, you barely have time to take a glimpse.  You can also have a look at Himalayan peaks if the weather is clear enroute which can make your day."
180,Purely Divine üôè,It is very famous temple in jammu located in katra . All people come from india as well as foreigners came there .Its Navratri celebration is mind blowing  . When u come to jammu also come to mata Vaishno devi
181,Divine Connect,Cold at Mata Rani Darbar. Shrine board has done good arrangements for pilgrimage. Feel blessed after Darshan. Can participate in Aarti by paying some amount.
182,Mandir Vaishno Devi,Visit this Mata Devi temple and feel the power of spirituality. from Katra to Mandir it takes around 5-6 hours to complete the journey.its location is very nice and natural secenary is very beautiful.
183,Tarakote marg from ardhkuwari to katra.,"the trek from katra to Bhawan (temple ) is about 14 kms and it takes about 6 hours to reach the temple .You have to register at any one of Yatri registration centers to start trekking .The registration centers are closed in the night after 10.00Pm ,so if you want to start your trek in the early morning ,you have to register yourself in the night itself  .They are Chopers which fly between Katra and Sanjichat ,but these dont operate most of the time because of bad weather ..After the dharsan of the goddess ,you have to visit Bharvi temple which is again a steep 3km trek .A rope way is being built ,to this place ,hopefully it will  be operational soon .the trekking path is full of horses ,try to use the new path with battery operated cars if you cannot walk .Trekking uphill and downhill on the same day is very tiring ,stay the night over at the temple ,check the official website of the temple for accommodation"
184,Always crowded,"Its beautiful very well maintained and clean & organised place.You can go direct to Katra or can get down at Jammu and take private vehicle and got to katra so you can do first darshan in Nagrota Maa kol kandoli.I always prefer to start darshan in the morning time so get up early and start your journey which is mesmerizing all the people whom you know or unknown everyone chant one thing and greet with same "" Jai Mata Di""if planning to attain Aarti then please keeep following things in mind  Reach bhawan by 4 in the evening or 4 am in the morning fresh and up and 5.30 gate opens for Aarti,  Aarti start @ around 6:20 and finish in the morning by 8 and evening  by 8.30.For Aarti you need to do online booking each person 1000 Rs. but really worth spending.for me its' always rejuvenating and its my Mom's house how you feel when you go to maika after long break i always have same feeling.Jai Mata Di"
185,"Any local agent for helicopter , room booking","Its a place, only a very good fortune can make you visit Vaishno Devi Mandir...  I have seen cases people travel till katra,,, go till Bhawan... but can take a glimpse...  If you are fortunate enough to be there.. You'll feel an out of the world Energy...An average person cant walk up 14 KMs in a single run, but people do it every day... U gotta feel it..."
186,Amazing experience,"I visited Maa Vaishno Devi temple last week. It was my first visit during Navratri. The flowers decoration at Holy cave was marvelous and unforgettable. Although rush was there at darbar,but I could get darshan easily as on line Arti was booked in advance. Rooms can also be booked on line though official web site of Shrine board.The darshan of Maa inside Holy cave are in the form of Pindi (rock). For non believers, it is just a rock, but lakhs of devotees including me have got everything from Her."
187,One should visit once in a life,"Had wonderful darshan at Vaishno Devi. The trek is tiring, it took us around 4 hours to reach the top before a further 2km walk to actually get darshan. We left at 7pm so it was a bit cooler which made the walk more comfortable. The facilities were excellent with toilets, hand rails, lighting and much of the journey is covered, sheltering you from the sun. Speakers playing devotional songs and devotees chanting throughout the trek made the 4 hours go very quickly. Jai Mata Di"
188,Jai Mata Di,"Its always a pleasure to pay visit to the holy shrine, starting from ban ganga where you start the journey, then reaching half way to adh kunwari and later taking up either old route or new battery operated route to all the way up to bhavan. At bhavan you que up for the prasad to be taken to bhavan and deposit your belonging in a locker and then que up for darshan to bhavan. Darshan may take you about 45 mins to an hour to complete pooja. Next you move ahead to shiv gufa and if you wish you may even go to bhairon ghati for darshan"
189,Visited Vaishnodevi Mata Shrine,nice holy place  visited for darshan Jai Maa Vaishnavdevihad a wonderful exprience as i am visiting continuously for last 4 years
190,Jai Mata Di,Jai mata di.Must book a room in bhawan in advance  to get out of tension of bath and freshing.no need to carry huge water because it available every where.Should keep some warm cloths during september.
191,Unplanned,"The trekking  starts from Ban Ganga barrier and ends at it destination at main temple or Bhavan. The whole of the experience is blissful and pleasant. With clean and well maintained washrooms, hygienic Cafeteria and eating points all along the way.On rainy season, yo can find clouds passing thru your face.The only down-point is fast running Ponies, they make journey troublesome at some sharp turns"
192,MENTALLY ELEVATING EXPERIENCE,"We hired tattu to go temple as we have to leave katra in evening. One should bargain well with tattu keepers. There were small dhabas on the way. One can have snacks & tea on the way. We recommend to start early in morning . If one has sufficient time, one can go on foot. There was a queue in temple. One needs to wear lot of woolen clothes if gone in dec end.You can buy prasad before arrival.One should not prefer to eat chola or rajma on the way as people cook it with lot of soda. It can upset one's stomach"
193,Mata ne bulaya hai üòä,Well managed temple.Great effort by shrine board to develop this place.new road from ardhkumari to vaishnodevi is excellent.great for pilgrimage.Keep it up.
194,Heaven on Earth,one of the holy place in India & i love to go there jab bhi mata ka bulawa aata hai . Haan sach hai bina bulawe ke koi bhi Maa k Darbaar me nahi Ja sakta. Mata k darbaar me bahut he shanti milti hai. there is goog food on the way by Vaishno Devi Trust cheap & fresh. once you reach at the top & want to have rest there is blaanket counter they give you free but you need to deposit money & when you return blanket back you get your money back. You can find bed also there to sleep but in summer they get full quickly if cant find the room take the blankets & go to terrace you can sleep nicely up there. Mata k darshan k baad Bhairu Baba k darshan k liye raasta jaroor pooch le agar aap steps se jaa rahe hain to otherwise you will reach to sanjhi chat which is far.Jor se bolo SACHHE DARBAR KI JAI
195,Jai Mata di,Vaishno Devi temple in Katra (J & ‡§ï‡•á) is a must place to go to for pilgrimage. A lifetime divine experience. Based on the hills is the unique temple with Mata Pindis. Darshans are to be done through a cave. Mata Aartis are performed in the morning and evening. Special arrangements are done for the Aartis.
196,Divine power of the goddess only can help you trek the high altitude mountains,"A beautiful spiritually inclined trek within hills. Actually Maa Vaishno devi darshan depends entirely by which way you travel to the peak of the hills into the temple. There are multiple options to reach Vaishno Mandir. Opt for Helicopter if travelling with aged members and if you want to save your legs from tiring but in that case you will miss out the thrill of trekking up and walking across the beautifully well paved roads along the heart of the hills. Now if you decide to trek and feel like giving up in the middle then mules and horses are there for your rescue. You can rent them at a nominal rate and enjoy a horse ride up into the peak. I opted just for walking up to the Jai mata di mandir. I started my trek at round evening 6:00 PM and completed my whole journey including the return to the foots within 3:00 AM in the morning. I took one big halt of around 45 min to complete my dinner and also took few individual breaks of 5‚Äì7 min each while on my road. Roads are nicely maintained and water is available in plenty as well as soft foods. Toilets are also within reach so nothing to worry about. While climbing up, the city below appears majestic with small lights glowing everywhere and the scene is very serene. You can also take appropriate rest in waiting rooms and get some sleep though no one generally does feel asleep on the way. Once in a lifetime we should opt for a trek into Maa Vaishno devi mandir. Thousands of devotees from all round the world gather to get blessings from Maa. **Go for it and you will never regret**"
197,Weekend trip from delhi,"We booked a package with hotel Sri hari nivas ketra that includes  Jammu airport pick up and drop,two nights stay and helicopter tickets.all worked fine for us.It is difficult to walk or go by koda for elders and kids.heli tickets open one month prior to travel date and sold on  the date itself. we had our darshan in one hour . Visited Bairavanath temple by walk.pleasent experience."
198,Way to vaishno devi temple on the top of mountain,"I have participated in Aarti at Vasno devi. It was a devine experience.You can book your slot online at official site of vashno devi 60 days in advance. Ensure that you go in the night at room numebr 8 at Bhawan around 8 PM to collect your token number.You must carry your debit or credit card used in booking with your ID proof.Reach again near room number 8 for at around 6 AM to participate in Aarti.Aarti booking can also be done at stop for this, you must reach at 5.30 morning time at room number 8.00, depending upon available slot may get chance to participate in aarti.Hope this will help"
199,Jai Mata Ki,This is place near Katra in J&K. People have great devotion to their Goddess.They run to get the Glimpses of Mata Vaishno Devi.The journey is tough which makes the devotees to go on foot 13 km of Long journey with chanting of Jor se bolo Jai Mata Ki. The place is beautiful and at a height of about 5000 ft.The management has maintained it peoperly. All needed facilities has been developed and continuously being developed. Only the devotion of our Great Hindus who had made this place centre of attraction
200,jai mata di,Mata Ji Darshan was sacred and very spiritual.We get good time for Darshan.It was the my second visit to Mata Vaishno Devi.
201,A very interesting visit to the Temple,"One can see the good work shrine board is doing. The path till adhquari has been broadened and at places, separate path allocated for mules, crowds are nicely managed. We have Bose speakers all along the way to heighten the feeling."
202,Very Good Darshan @ end of July,plz give me the information about timings of  auto services at vaishno devi???we are going on 21 of this month..and what will be the climate over there
203,Very nice,Jai mata diIt is about 14 uphill tracking and we have many options to reach there and best place to go and take mata jis blessings
204,Nice!,Great Management and full of Bhakti. I travel here every year with my family even twice in 2017. This time I went with helicopter and it was a great fun with kids. Well managed.
205,Jai Mata Di - Always revitalizing to visit!,This is a place of faith and prayer. We must visit this place everytime when we visit Jammu.Jammu is the Dwar of Ma Vaishno Devi.I must say if you want to do pilgrimage you must do it on your foot.A real devotee must visit this place on his power and blessings of Devi Maa.
206,Amazing amazing and only amazing atmosphere,"The track to Vaishno Devi Mandir starts at Ban Ganga in Katra. If you intend to go walking then there are two routes-- old route and the new route. The old route is not clean as it is full of pony dung. The new route is much cleaner though they say its longer. I would advice the devotees to use the new route as its much clean, less crowded,  good refreshments, clean toilets . However you will not find any pony wala or pithu or palanquin midway  on this route. If you want to track at night then this may not be the best route as its less crowded. On either of the routes, the first two kms is steep but once you get the rhythm in your breath you won't feel any discomfort in tracking the remaining 10 kms. On a safer side its advisable if you can hire a pithu to carry your bags. There are accommodation rooms available at the Bhawan, so if you have planned your yatra in advance  I would suggest that you book the rooms as per your choice such that it will be very convenient to bath  and rest.  The general facilities of bath and toilets as well as lockers are provided free of cost but it is not clean. The morning aarti takes place at 6:20 am and evening aarti also around 6 pm. If you want to sit in the aarti you can book the tickets online.They have facility to buy the aarti tickets from room no. 8 at the main Bhawan one hour before the aarti on first come basis. The people reaching by Helicopter have facilities of waiting room with locker at extra cost of Rs. 140/- per head."
207,One of the Holy place Vaishno Devi Mandir,"Visited Vaishno Devi with family and a friend's family. Very nice weather and less crowded, which we never  It was a little cold but manageable."
208,Start walking to the shrine in the evening and reach there at mid-night was a great experience,"Entire journey detail about Vaishnodevi yatra. If u r coming by Indian railways then u can get down at Katra station and checkin into a hotel. If u r coming by flight you can get down at jammu airport and can take a prepaid taxi from jammu airport to katra(foothill of Vaishnodevi hills - trikuta parvat). This journey from Jammu to katra takes about 1.5hrs with an Excellent view of mountains and tunnels. On the way u can tell your driver to take you to the first darshan of Vaishnodevi that is - kaul kondoli mata mandir ...the driver may take some extra charge for that . Once u reach katra checkin to a comfortable hotel. My recommendation is Hotel Anurag becoz i have stayed there with a group of 17 and found this hotel to be very comfortable. As everything is at a walkable distance from this place. Especially the Atm is downstairs. Market is at 1 min distance. Once u have checked in you should do anything else simply relax and enjoy your stay in the hotel. Next day if u have already booked a helicopter then tell the hotel staff in advance to arrange a drop till helipad. Dont forget to carry your helicopter ticket printouts , original Id and the debit and credit card thru which the booking is done. Without this they will deny boarding you. The rules are very strict. Before taking the helicopter right do take your yatra slip which is Mandatory and you need to produce it at the main entrance of Vaishnodevi bhawan . If in case if u forgot to get the parchi(slip) there is one yatra slip counter available before the helicopter ride. Remember to take it without fail. Helicopter takes few mins to reach at sanjichat the place on the hill where the helipad is located. From sanjichat to mata Vaishnodevi bhawan is approximately3km. You can either walk that path, take a pony orelse palki is also available. People who haven't made helicopter booking and wishes to take a walk to Vaishnodevi from katra they should take yatra parchi for all the members and start your journey early in the morning for an awesome sunrise view, the stretch is approximately 12kms and there are shops on the way which runs 24hrs. Toilets are available on the way and drinking fresh water too.You will get to see banganga (balganga) river on the way it is said that mata bhagwati formed this river with the help of bow and arrow to wash her hair and lord Hanumanji drank water from this river. People taking a walk also get to take darshan of Vaishnodevi charan paduka which is also on the way.After charanpaduka the next darshan is ardhkuwari gufa which is on the way and its optional for the yatris whether to go through gufa or not.It takes approximately 2to3hrs to get ardhkuwari gufa darshan. You first need to take a slip from the slip counter. You will get a token number and have to wait for your number. This guffa is very narrow not recommended for very young kids and elderly people. It is believed that mata Vaishnodevi has stayed in this gufa for 9 months and whoever passes thru it its very much blessed. Unfortunately people taking a to and fro helicopter ride will miss all this darshan. There r two route to reach mata Vaishnodevi from ardhkuwari.. 1) Himkoti route- 5kms  2) Haathimattha route-6kms Kindly take himkoti route which is shorter well maintained and there are luckily no horses on this route. This route was built especially for battery operated cars to run. Elderly people , medical ailment people can request for the battery car on chargeable  basis. Rest all who are fit can take a walk. Next stop is mata Vaishnodevi bhawan. This is the main temple where u can see three pindi roop of mata Vaishnodevi. The most powerful and divine place on the earth. If you have prayed wholeheartedly with clean intentions your wishes will be fulfilled here.  Once u get matavaishnodevi pindiroop darshan it is said that u need to take baba bhairav darshan which is approximately 1.5kms above Vaishnodevi bhawan. You can take a walk, go on a pony, orelse the best option is the newly constructed  ropeway which is convinient and cheap. The cost to and fro is Rs 100per person. Once ur bhairav baba darshan is done it is believed that your yatra is successful done. Best time to visit Vaishnodevi- If u are a summer person and can't bare the cold then u should visit from March to june. It wont be much cold and the weather will be pleasant. Recommended to carry light winter wear as it is cold near bhawan and bhairav even in summers. The only drawback is it is too crowded during this time. It takes approximately 6 to 7 hrs to get the darshan. People who loves winters and less crowd.. inshort people like me can think of going in winters .. from October to February.. Chilling cold and very less crowded ... From December to February. But people need to take special precautions like they should be medicslly fit and should bare the harsh cold climate. Temp can fall below zero too. Not reccomended for elderlies and family traveling with kids and infants. Thinks to carry for the trip- winter Jacket, shawl, mufflers, lipbalm, moisturize your skin very well and keep yourself hydrated by having ample of water. Get the best quality shoes for the trek, avoid wearing heels and wear comfortable clothing. During winters don't forget to wear thermal inside which will keep u warm. If you have any doubts about the trip feel free to contact me on myemailid- akash.sky1115@gmail.comI have been going to Vaishnodevi since 11years so i can help you out if u are in any doubt on humanitarian grounds .. Jai Mata Di..."
209,Temple,Its always a delight to visit the holy shrine of Maa Vaishno devi. We have been going regularly for last 16 years and we have seen the changes taking place in regards to infrastructure maintenance and betterment  of facilities for pilgrims. The Shrine board is doing a good job of spending the money they receive for improving facilities and providing necessary requirements for those visiting the shrine. Well done!
210,Powerful Godess,"There are 2 convinient ways to reach katra, Vaishno Mata from Delhi:1. Take Direct Train From Delhi to Katra station(Best Option). Some trains are available for direct katra.2. Take train till Jammu Tavi. From Jammu  Tavi take bus till Katra. Although its little bit long way but if you are looking for the sight seen or shopping or with friends, its best ways to travel.(I personally prefer this)In both ways you will reach katra by maximum 12 pm in the noon.In katra, you can take rooms leave your bags there. My personal advice is to take some rest after that and start the journey in the evening. Weather is very Pleasant in the evening.Cons - We did not find good food there. Food was very costly and tasteess."
211,Call from Ma ,"Visiting Vaishno Mata for Darshan is every Hindu‚Äôs wish & it is said that you never know when Mata Rani calls you! It just so few happened that my trip was finalized in a couple of days & with no train tickets available drove all the way to Katra from Delhi (650 KM) alongwith my Wife, son & Mother. Ascended the Trikuta the same night, had Mata‚Äôs Darshan early morning & was back again by foot @ Katra by 10 am next day. And wonder what, No major body ache or pain witnessed......This is the power of Mata Rani.....‚ÄúJai Mata Di‚ÄùHorses enroute are very disturbing to the flow of devotees & charge exorbitant prices. Their foul smell all across the route are completely unhygenic & the ride uncomfortable too. Horses should be banned totally & the government should plan a cable car immediately till Katra which will not only help generate more religious tourists but the elderly will have a comfortable ride. And for those shopkeepers who resist this move; try & understand that people will continue to equally walk by foot because that is what their heart says.....hence their business will continue to flourish!"
212,Religious trip,Had a desire to visit Vaishno Devi shrine for a long time. Now I feel it was not that difficult as thought. Entire route to Vaishno Devi from Katra is kept neat and clean. We opted for helicopter ride from Katra to Sanjhi Chhat and walked for 2.5 km to have darshans and on way back preferred to walk down 14 km. It was a great experience and wish everyone should get chance to visit this beautiful place.
213,Jai maa Vaishnodevi,"I, with my wife visited Mata Vaishnodevi on 24 Feb 2017, the day of ' Maha Shivaratri'. The Helicopter trip up and down Devi Temple was hassle free and enjoyable. Ofcourse one has to plan for the trip well  in advance. It is better if you can do so. Weather was wonderful when we visited. Devi Darshan at the temple was smooth. You may have to walk approx. 5kms up and down from helipad or hire a pony or Palki. I am sure you would not feel tired even you opt for walking. Jag Mata Di."
214,Awesome Darshan,"Maa vaishno Devi is holy place of not only Hindu but for all. Every one going to this place, why? Some people say to prayer to mata rani and other says to walk and talk picnics place. But I believe this place only for spiritual to prayer and see Mata darshan. The connectivity to Mata vaishno Devi by bus, air, train but easy way is by train ?? .this place situated in trikuta mountain where maa live here to escape bharavnath. To reach temple there is 15 km walking distance. Also running electric auto but actual devotion in foot. In between you will see food place, water and temple of mata. Now on today many facilities are available at katra station like food, accomdation pick and drop facilities. Many more things there."
215,Saare Bolo . . . Jai Maata Dee !!,I visit Vaishno Devi first time with my family it was awesome. It was very beautiful if you visit first time you will love it. It located around 40kms from Jammu on the mountain range. The climate on the mountain is very cool and cloudy. You can reach the temple by foot only. The transport facility to Katra is available from Jammu. It is situated at the height 5300 feet from the sea level. This is an important pilgrimage spot. It consists of the holy shrine of Shri Vaishno Devi Mata. His cave is present I side a three peaked mountain called Trikuta.
216,Jai Mata Di,"Visited Vaishno devi yesterday. Beautiful place. We finished the total darshan in 9 hours. Try not to carry any bags with you just some money and mobile phone and I will enlist how I completed the journey and some tips you can use during your next visit - 1. Started from hotel at 11 am. Some hotels provide pickup and drop to the base of the mandir. Ours was one of those - Hotel Durga Residency. Reached the base of the temple at 11.30 am. The base of the temple is 10 minutes by walk from Banganga base.2. You can arrange for a horse/ pony from the base. That would be beneficial.  We arranged two ponies at Rs. 700 until Ardhkuwari. Ardhkuwari is half way from the main Bhawan/ Vaishno devi temple. For ponies from base of the temple to Bhawan it is maximum of Rs.700 per person. 3. If you do not need a pony at the start of the journey, you can always hire ponies at Banganga base. It is better to hire ponies while climbing to reach temple because when coming down the road is downhill and as a result due to friction when sitting on the pony your back will pain a lot and you might even get rashes in the area. 4. We reached Ardhkuwari in 1 hour. We started walking towards Bhawan. There are 2 ways from Ardhkuwari - old road (purana rasta) and new road ( naya rasta). We used the new way. No ponies are allowed on the new road and hence it is less crowded and very clean. Trucks and electric cars are allowed on this road. The Bhawan is 5-6 km from Ardhkuwari. There is another option for old or physically challenged people to reach Bhawan from Ardhkuwari that is electric car/ auto. Please ask around at Ardhkuwari as to where to book for this car since it's booking counter was not on the new road that we used. 5. Mobile phones, polythene bags, plastic bags, shoes, huge luggage are not allowed at the temple. Hence there are lockers situated before reaching Bhawan. Make sure to keep any jewellery and money with you and store everything else in a bag and give it in the first locker post that you encounter uphill. Because the next locker is at Bhawan and there is a huge queue at that locker plus you have to to go off track to reach that locker post. 6. We reached Bhawan by walk in 2.5-3 hours. After reaching Bhawan there is a 'Gate no. 3' that you need to enter which is the main queue to reach the temple. The day we visited was just before Navratri festival (of Katra) so the entire place was decorated beautifully with Flowers and the lane for Gate no. 3 was covered in flowers. It was beautiful. It was not much rush at around 4 pm (since most people try to travel at night to avoid sun). At the end you will reach a cave and the idol. They let us pray for a minute since there was no rush. You can hand over the prasad to the pujari and he will give it back to you. Immediately after the worship, we sat there outside the cave for about 15 minutes and left. 7. On the way back after 6 pm, the chill started setting in. So it's always better to carry a sweater. We ate dosa and rajma rice at Himkoti Bhojnalaya downhill. The dosa was not good. Try to avoid. Rajma rice was ok. 8. We went back walking till Ardhkuwari and then hired a pony till Banganga. It is better to hire a pony till base of temple (make sure to confirm the dropping point before you hire). (It will be even better if you walk or hire a palki instead of a pony for reasons mentioned point no. 3)  Hope this review reaches everyone wishing to travel to Vaishno devi! Jai Mata Di!"
217,Jai Mata Di ... ,"Very peaceful and holy place to visit. Strongly recommended to go by walking from main gate till the bhawan. Excellent infrastructure, food and other facilities and once you enter inside the temple you will amaze to see the pidi. Jai mata di."
218,Sri Mata vaishnodevi must visit temple in India.,Myself and my wife visited vaishnodevi. The trip was made suddenly after we had a dream of visiting this place. This was the first time. We started climb by walk around 1.45 am and reached around 5.45 am at Bhawan. We had a chopper to return but got cancelled due to rain and heavy winds. So walked all the way down to reach katra by 1300 hrs on same day..darshan was excellent . But be prepared for the cold and equip yourself with sufficient winter clothing..
219,Divine live Holy place to feel blessed.,when you will along the hills of vasno devi it looks like you are walking on the road of hill and you will feel strong when you complete the journey.
220,Blessings of Maa vaishno devi,Superb darshan to Darbaar . Lots of facilities through out the journey . Blessed with ashirwad of Vaishno Devi. Less crowd in December
221,Jai Mata Di,"I and my mother went to this holy shrine in October mid after Navratri. It's better to plan your visit during less crowded months. Try to get online registration, as it saves a lot of timing in booking at the counter and checking of parchi at every check post. Take precautions of your health status during climbing and complete your journey by breaking it into few kilometers of continuous walk and then rest. Do not carr prasad from the entrance shops, as you will get it even at the Bhawan. So don't carry unnecessary weight from the starting only."
222,The great darshanam of mata vaishnodevi darshanam,"Yatra to vaisno devi provides inner peace to human soul . The journey of 13 kms at trikuta hills tiredness vanishes as soon as u get to see three holy pindies in form of mata Kali, mata vaishno, mata sarswati. This is very sacred place and people can only come to mata if she wants u here.The shrine board is continuously upgrading roads , helicopter service, battery car to make Yatra more convenient. If u are reading this make a plan to visit the divine placeJai Mata Di"
223,Holy Place - Jai Mata Di ,It is the temple of Maa vaishno situated in in an area called katra surrounded by eye soothing views. The green mountains touches the clouds. There are lot of monkeys also. So be careful about them.
224,Maiya ka Darbaar ,"Most memorable pilgrimage place, one must visit this place, wish is fulfilled by Maa Vaishno Devi ji."
225,Maa teri kripa rahe,good to track also have helicopter facility to reach there via sanji chhat than again track it for 3.5 km.
226,"Rich temple with little amenities, get exploited your religiousness","It is really nice to visit shri mata vaishno devi mandir.This place is heaven to earth, as i am localite i suggest everyone to come this holy place and enjoy ur fantastic trip. it will be full of joy, excitement to visit this spiritual place.recently a new path to Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu for foot-travelers and battery-operated cars has been opened.you can try that one."
227,Unpleasant Experience,"Its great experience of blessings of Mata Rani, I am able to get your darshan along With Morning Arti Maa always keep blessings on us. Jai Mata Diüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè"
228,very good place to visit,"This is the first place which gives me eminent pleasure all the time I visit here.It is the place situated over18 mile from Katra.Here you will find different variety of temples along the way to Maa Vaishno Darbaar.You can also use Helicopter facility, horse riding, Pitthu.Hence I would suggest you travel here as many times you can."
229,Not a serene experience,Mata vaishno devi temple is very beautiful temple.a good palace for trip with family or friends. ok.
230,Holy visit,Had a nice Darshan at Mata Vaishnodevi and would like to come again every year and have Mata rani  blessings
231,Awesome Holy place for Hindus,"We had quite a peaceful darshan at Mata Vaishno Devi, especially with our 5 tear old kid.We got the yatra parchi online from official website of Vaishno Devi shrine board. And we started on early Monday morning around 6:30 am, took 2 horses & 1 pitthu while climbing up, and reached Bhawan around 10.30 am. The crowd was comparatively less, as it was a weekday, and we entered through Gate 3 without much hassle & pushing.The weather was quite cool early morning, so a sweater with a jacket made it comfortable.With the sun shining bright & almost no wind, it wasn't very chilly at this time of the year (Nov 1st week).After the darshan, we had something to eat at Sagar Ratna restaurant. It was simple & good.And then we started our descent back to Katra, and reached down by 2.30 pm. The weather had become little hot by that time, and we had to remove our jacket & sweater. While going down, we only had 1 pitthu for our kid. Myself & my wife walked down. We took few breaks in between, but in total, the walk down was completed in about 2.5 hours. A cold coffee break at CCD helped recharge the body & mind to complete the trek down.Note that a ropeway construction is in progress from near Bhawan, to take pilgrims to Bhairon Nath mandir."
232,Jai Mata di,This is one of the most famous pilgrimage places in India. Mandir is good and shrine board has made good arrangements for the travelers. They need to improve on providing rooms at Bhawan easily.
233,A memorable trek to the Shrine,A must visit place for Hindu in India and the place where wishes comes true. Situated on trikuta hill and having to walk for around 13 km to have darshan of mata rani. Jai Mata Di
234,This place deserves to be on you travel list,Mata ji mandir visiting is a booster to our life energy .Visiting to mata vaishno devi mandir is always a family tour so we enjoyed the blessing of mata ji in a festive & spiritual mood .                                                                                                                        With Best Wishes & Prayer Nadi Vaidya Ajit Singh Yadav9034540540
235,Most admirable Goddess,"Very bad service for the devotees. you have to travel on foot for 13-14 km. The palki and Helicopter rates are too high. the ponies are very dangerous. sometimes the slip on the roads.They should make a pitched road for devotees, but that will decrease people's faith in this temple as it is famous for the climb. and don't climb at night . after ardhkumari there are no shops for water or food."
236,Disappointment,"I visited the holy shrine during navratras and to be honest did not have much trouble reaching the temple, except that I was a bit tired due to the journey up the hill. To start your journey, you first have to register at the yatra parchi counter which is in the main square in Katra town. The counter closes at 10 pm every day and you have to start the journey within 4 hours after getting the parchi. The journey starts from Banganga post which is 2 kms from Parchi counter. Banganga can be reached by foot or auto rickshaw (which are very expensive in Katra town). It is a total rip-off, however considering the long trek ahead we booked an auto rickshaw for Rs. 100. Once you reach Banganga, you just have to start the trek. For which you can also use horses. The horses cost Rs. 700 for journey upto the main shrine and Rs. 380 for half distance. If you are using the horses, keep in mind that Adhkuwari (half way mark temple) can be visited only at the start of your journey, because you need the yatra parchi for visiting this shrine. Temple management takes the parchi after your visit to the main shrine. Distance from Banganga to Adhkuwari is 6 kms, Adkuwari to Vaishno Devi 6 kms and from Vaishno Devi to Bhairavnath another 3 kms. You just have to follow the queues and other yatris to reach the temple. Along the way there are several points for refreshments and rest so take your time and don‚Äôt rush since the journey back down the hill is equally tiring for the body. Don‚Äôt forget to keep your leather wallet, leather belt, mobile phone etc in the locker otherwise you will be taken out of the queue. Once you had the darshan in the holy shrine, visit Bhairvnath Temple also, which is another 3 kms trek up from Vaishno devi temple. It is said that Vaishno Devi darshan is not complete without a visit to Bhairavnath Temple. From this point starts your journey back towards Banganga. Although a lot of people think that journey downhill is not very tiring, it turns out to be equally tiring for already tired legs, so do take rest and refreshment on your journey back as well."
237,"HOLY PLACE @ MAA VAISHNO DEVI MANDIR, KATRA(J&K)",Vaishno devi is a place where one should visit in a lifetime and espesially for the persons who beleive in god the way of this place is opened througout the year.
238,"Very good spiritual place, must visit once in lifetime",Visited Vaishno Devi & Bharon Nath Mandir on Navrathis...Out of world experience...Walked all the way up and down in 12 hours on 31st March ..A great experience..wonderful weather..Jai Mata Di..
239,Hai Mata di ,"This was my first trip to Vaishno devi, i was travelling with my grandmother and she is over 75 so the plan was to make it as comfortable as it can be. A word of advice to families travelling with elderly and kids, please take a day of rest in katra before starting of for Vaishnodevi. The best time to start for darshan is early morning as the first train with its horde of devotees will not arrive by 8, better to complete your Darshan by afternoon. The peak hours are usually during morning and evening, as aarti takes place at the same time. I had already booked yatra parchi online which saves you the additional hassle of getting it there in katra. Moreover most of the hotels offer cloak room faciliy so you can leave your luggage there. The start from Banganga was chaos at its best, there was hardly any space to walk as most it was occupied by mules. If you are planning to hire mules or carriers, you need to haggle with them a lot. The fixed rates are already written outside but nobody goes by it. The rates for carrier varies from 3000-3500 one way, it also depends on the weight of person. It can go upto 5500 depending on your weight. Mules are cheaper but very uncomfortable, you will end up with pain in every part of your body. I had already decided to hire a carrier for her (it costed me around 3000). It was booked for one way as we had  accommodation at bhavan (the booking opens around 1 month back at 10am). The journey till Vaishno devi is around 11kms one way, me and my brother decided to walk all the way. The road till adhkuwari is very bad, you have people and mules running or walking on the same track. After adhkuwari, you have a separate track which is well maintained. You can either take a battery operated car or walk all the way. Till adhkuwari the walk is very steep but after that it gradually smooths down. In my opinion those with strong conviction can walk one way and take the helicopter service while returning. Though you need to book them online one month before sometimes it is also available off the counter at bhavan."
240,Jai mata di,"Amazing temple in Katra, Jammu and Kashmir States of northern India. Place is very large property having 4 guest houses available for overnight stay and helicopter service, lockers, roof covered path. Best time for visiting is winter. Priest was very dedicated and told me about Gods in English, thought is was a huge line. If you don't want to walk barefeet take warm socks(especially if you are foreigner like me), it's not very clean and cold - you will need to walk a lot. Helicopter service is very cool, surrounding nature's amazing! Helicopter price one-way 1005 rupees, round trip 2010 rupees. I highly recommend make a booking online pririor because slots are sold out very fast. When you reach the might sell you one-way ticket if seat is available, but no return guarantee. From heli pod to temple 2 km walk, but you can hire a horse ride approx. 250-300 rupees a person one way, but bargain. Nice and easy ride without stepping on poops. There are holy donation bags available cost costs 40 rupees, look for special counter and watch what people do. Entrance is free, only donations. When exit find a counter giving  small pack with coin and dry fruit. As far as I am aware working hours 7-17 365 days a year."
241,Jay Mata Di,Vaishnodevi temple is located in katra near jammu . Many of the yatris came here and took a blessings from mata rani. Its very simple to travel a direct train travel from hemkund express. A long sight seeing scenery with a high mountain was so wonderful to see. Every yatris took a darshan and many ashrams and dharmshalas was under the shrine board. Yatris also having a good facility of bhojanshalas. In winter blankets were also provided by the ashrams. Location was totally free polluted and safe environment. At the time of yatra the pony facility was there for the oldage person. Jai mata di.
242,Jammu/Katra to Mata mandir - Best way to reach mandir with plan of action,"""JAI MATA DI""Magical and spiritual place to visit. Very well maintain by shrin board. Good connectivity with other states. Love to visit again and again"
243,Jai Mata Di,really a great temple near jammu. you can enjoy 14 km long walk on beautiful hills. we visit every year. you can book rooms near temple in advance. visit on new year if you can. you can see snowfall
244,Best trip so far ,this is the best place for roam fun and having blessing of Mata Vaishno Devi. I spent 4 Days Here this is the best days of my life.
245,Divine destination ,"Vaishno Devi is worshipped by all Hindus. We were 2 people. Since our vaishno Devi darshan was starting leg of.Kashmie trip, I didn't want get fatigue formwhole tour. I booked helicopter for up and down. You have to book tickets one month before and have to be very quick before it get sold. It was extra ordinary experience in chopper.Mandir trust facilities are superb. All paths are super clean, food is easily available, security arrangement are good. Nothing to say about Darshan. You feel that people let you stand forever.Katra is very beautiful town and you get spiritual feeling all over. You choose any restaurant, food is awesome. No onion and garlic is used in whole Katra town."
246,Jai Mata Di,Great spiritual trip.... felt energetic... one of the best road trip as well from Jammu to Katra.. very modern and second to none...
247,A holy place with unique experience of spirutuality,Jai Mata DiAwesome place for the Darshan of Mata Rani.There is 3 ways to go up.1) Helicopter upto 9 km from the starting point.2) Walking / Trekking3) On the back of HorseThe best part is you wouldn't feel tired because there are refreshments available for Devotees.I would like all the devotees  who are visiting Vaishno Devi place do visit Bhirab Baba ka mandir as well.
248,Vaishno Maa Calling,"As they say in India, whenever you have call from Goddess then only you can come here...I was lucky to be called again after 4 years of long gap. Before starting Your journey please make sure you have all the valid tickets already with You as You would come across many checking points and do not carry items listed at the entry gate else be ready to loose them. You have facility at affordable prices to pick chopper service towards Bhavan to and fro. Auto prices are ok but they only adjust 4 person to sit,Pony service is ok just bargain as much as you can,, you will find number of  massage shops who have massage chairs to relax while travelling but at initial stage later there are local who do massage if you feel tired and you may find them at every other turn. Pick locker which are spacious don't carry leather items like wallets and belts etc as its not allowed inside bhawan. You can buy canes/laathees while moving upwards which you may return as few shops have buy back offer;), You will not only have religious trip however, You will come across many beautiful, mesmerizing, picturesque views on the way"
249,spiritual visit,As the saying goes that one only gets to visit if you are invited to come and visit Mata Rani. although I am not a devotee i decided to accompany my friends. The journey is hectic but if one has the will then there is a way. It is 20 kilometres one way up to the temple and then another 3 kilometres Bhairavnath Temple. We did the complete stretch and then came down. It is such a beautiful journey that one has to do it once in a lifetime.
250,Keep your spirits and energy high!,The Holy Shrine is about 14 Km from katra and takes 4-5 hours one side for an average devotee.Carrying Water bottles and medicines is recommended
251,Trip to Vaishno Devi temple,Visited Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in May 2017. It's one of most famous holy shrines of Hindus in North India. The shrine is very well maintained and darshans are very well organised. Must visit with a family.
252,"Jai Mata Rani,Trikuta and Vaishnavi","Amazing temple of Maa Vaisno Devi ..... Top of the hill , like to go through by feet..Lots of fooding shops are available...."
253,You have to be tough mentally and physically to visit vaishnodevi,"Obviously, it's hard to walk and do darshan of Shree Mata Vaishnodevi after 16 km's. Prefer to start walking in the evening and do darshan in night only."
254,EVERY HINDU SHOULD VISIT ,"Jai Mata Di ! The entire 9km stretch from Banganga to Bhawan has been made so convenient now.Tiled route, covered pathway to protect you from sun or rains, places to sit all over, water and food/ snacks ar everybinch till ardhkumari, frequency reduces after that though but still so very well provided. Earlier I visited as a child and it was much tougher then.For those who need, Battery operated cars can be hired from ardhkumari to bhawan. Helicopters too operate between banganga and sanjhichat. Horse and paalki operate on all routes. Ropeway operates between bhawan and bhairo mandir. Atka aarti is unparalleled experience, so is waking up early morning and listening to the entire mountain reverberate in vedic chants."
255,Jai mata di,You can go to Mata only when you get the Bulawa.  Place of Bhawan give you a lot of peace.  Just ask while Bhairav temple as that's can make you confuse
256,Summer yatra,Inspite of millions of people visting every year this holy place is so well managed..shrine board is improving it day by day.Only problem is nusance being created by pony operators
257,Worst experience with RAO travels,I already visited Mata Vaishno Devi thrice.Really enjoyed the tour to the shrine.The whole yatra is so challenging that I remember the journey for long time to come.
258,Tiring..But amazing,"No review can justify the Maa ka Dwara which people throng after a strenuous walk which is steep and slope combined and tedious but it is MAA which makes it possible ,So just say Jai Mata Dee and with her blessings you will reach there.You can travel near by helecopter also but still there is a lot to walk,but the guiding force is helping you throughout the journey.Come and take her blessings."
259,Jai Mata Di,Vaishno devi temple is peaceful place and there is no purpose to visit it. Its pure serene and gods beleif for which kne visit the shrine.Premises are clean and there are lot of local restaurents and ammenities that tourists can use while their journey to thw shrine.Also while on the way to the top it is suggested to be beware and cautious from Monkeys and do not carry loose things in hand. It can cause troubles.
260,Trip to Vaishno Devi Shrine,Nice place to visit. It took 4 and 1/2 hours to reach Bhavan from Katra by walking. Nice journey. For coming down it took 2 and 1/2 hours to Katra.The place is really nice. We saw the aarti there. A little cold is there in night. So anybody going please take precautions for cold.Jai mata di
261,Peaceful and serene,"The toughest course is Tarakota Marg Route when you are walking for Darshan, it is longer and it is empty, you would be lonely group walking.The best route from Katra is reach Ardh Kuwari, then use Himkoti Route reach Bhawan, then go to Bhariavnath Temple, come back to Bhawan, use the Himkoti marg to walk down and reach Katra."
262,A Wonderful Religious Experience,Vaishno devi is one of the must vist temple in India.you have to visit there even once before you die man that place is heaven.I know its little bit difficult to travel all the way up but it's worth it.And don't forget to visit Baba bhairav nath temple it's only 4 km from the vaishno temple trust me you guys will not regret it.
263,Divine!!!,There is nothing like climbing the distance for the darshan. Started walking in the evening and by 11 was there. Took some rest at the pre booked place. Went in early around 4.30am to get in time for the morning Aarti. Nothing more divine. The complete atmosphere is so charged up. Will ensure I go there every year henceforth atleast once.
264,Nice Temple,"We visited Vaishno Devi - our first trip there. Overall the body takes lot of efforts to make the visit comfortable. We took a helicopter from Katra to the Mandir and back. Still, there was about 3Km distance one way from helipad to Vaishno Devi. There are horses, and palki for children and elders. Overall nice and largely hasslefree visit.cheers."
265,World Famous Temple!,This. Is a religous place Piligrims through out India visit thid place Nearest Railway station is Katra Govt. has made good arrangement for the pilgrims enroute to Vaishno Devi
266,Memorable Visit of the Tempel - Jai Mata Di ! ! !,"First a trip 3000 miles to India and a trip by car from Delhi to Katra (20 hrs in total ) was tiring but the longing to See Mata Di kept us strong . We started journey from Katra foot hills to the temple hiring a horse ride half way and a push chair to take my 2 kids, partner and myself(walking half way to temple) and paying for a porter to help us with luggage. All horseman, buggy guy and porter being an non Hindu they utter Jai mata Di building the confidence and closeness with us. The journey was wonderful feeling was great beautiful temple felt so much blessed and while returning both of us decided to walk with kids on the buggy pushed by 2 non Hindu guys assisted by the same porter back. My partner was very tired so I had to slow down with her to help her while the porter who built the confidence by nice talks and uttering jai mata di whenever we slowed down (being a Muslim) we were overwhelmed by his support . We let them walk ahead with my kids in the buggy ...at one point they stopped waiting for us to catch up ...my daughter (9yrs) came running to us saying she will not sit in the buggy as the men were behaving badly and touching her while she nodded off .....We made a complaint to shrine board at the foot hills the guys at counter took the porter and the buggy guys behind their office and thrashed them. There was no police involved although a statement of complaint has been handed over to the board so far....PLEASE BEWARE OF THE PORTERS, BUGGY GUYS AND THE HORSE GUYS...THEY MAY UTTER JAI MATA DI BUT THEIR MOTIVE IS CRUEL AND IT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING TO THEM.I WISH THEY BRING IN OTHER MEANS OF ADVANCED COMMUTING OPTION TO GET MATA‚Äôs blessings with love and peace. CRUELTY TO ANIMALS AND THE PURITY OF THE PLACE SPOILT BY WORTHLESS MEN WHO DO NOT VALUE THE SANCTITY AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS PLACE BUT WAITING TO PREY ON THE MONEY AND VULNERABLE / TIRED PILGRIMS.I am waiting to hear from the shrine board and the police as to what action has been taken."
267,What to keep in mind for Vaishno Devi Yatra?,Miracle place. The starting point starts from Bangagnga Gate. The shrine is situated at 12 Kms from the starting point. The entire route has a very good facilities like sheds/food stalls. Person can go through Horse/Palkhi/Walking and Helicopter. The entire route is neat and clean and maintained very micely
268,Maa Darshan,I have been to Vaishno Devi many times.. ita always a good experience visiting there.. But I recently visited there in 2nd week of september.. I would say this is not ideal time to visit.  The route is good but the bhawan only is under renovation.. So i found a lot of chaos out there.. It took us more than 4 hours for darshan.. Queue at the cloak room was never ending.. We had to quit searching locker and decided to go for darshan in 2 groups.  One queued for darshan and other taking care of belongings.. Queues at parchi counter and bhaint shop were also big.. I would suggest to plan after 2-3months once the bhawan facilities are restored properly..
269,Jai Mata Di - Visited in the last week of February. After waiting many years finally Mata Ne Bulaya.,A positive energy Darshan . Blessed by Vaishnav Mata . Had a great morning Arthi . Enjoyed the trip to the core
270,Maa vashnodevi yatra,The trek to the Bhawan of Maa Vaishnodevi was a fulfilling experience. We were 3 ladies aged 50 years who began the trek with a lot of anxiety and apprehension. But the trek happened without much difficulty. Being our first trip we decided to go to Ardh Kuwari too. We left hotel before 4.15 am. Our hotel dropped us Banganga. And we started trekking at 4.50 am. It was quite dark ... we started slowly and at our pace we managed to reach Ardh Kuwari at 7.45 am. After a darshan there we left for Bhawan by 10 am. This section of trekking was a more gentle slope as compared to the first part. By the grace of Maataji we reached without any difficulty. Unusually being a week day there was less crowd we got a very good darshan and got to pray well at the BhawanBeing real steep slope to Bhairao Ghat we hired a horse for our further trip to Bhairoa ghat and back down. By the time you have trekked for 6 hours we were all exhausted and started getting severe leg pain and back acheThe horse ride was horrible though in 2 hours we reached backTickets by helicopter was not available as we had not booked in advance Facilities are very good and entire area is clean. The horse track are smelly though this is unavoidable
271,Visit to Mata Rani,"A historic and religious place to visit, its is located around 12 km from katra , J&k bus stop , now a days helicopter is also availble but for that early booking is required, this 12km walkway is challenge to go up but it is really worth to go up against this challenge to see the place , on the way you get a lot of shops for the refreshment"
272,Jai Mata Di,Vaishno devi trip is one of the best trips for us so far. beautiful and holy place . awesome scenic beauty . had a awesome stay in katra. beautiful temple just loved it.
273,Divine trip,"This Is Matas(Goddess) abode. When you reach katra positive vibes start from there only. The three Matas(goddesses) are residing in the cave. You have to climb a mountain to reach there. But if you can not walk you can hire a horse or a palanquin. The other way is to book a helicopter. Then you have to walk a normal path of 3kms. But once you reach there, the climb is worth. The beautiful view of mountains. On both sides of fhe road you get everything to eat. Massagers are also available there. Good security, food,environment, people. Good luck!"
274,Jai Mata Di,"The Cave Temple of Maa Vaishno Devi Ji is Divine Experience , The Cave Temple is Located in foot hills of Trikuta Range , Approx 14 KM track from Katra , truly Gr8"
275,Beautiful Pilgrimage,"Mata Vaishno Devi is having her place on Trikuta Parbat. Holy place for Hindus. Each and every Hindu should visit this place to take blessings of Mata Rani. After darshan, you will feel good peace in mind and blessed."
276,Mata Vaishno Devi kai adbuth darshan,"Jai mata dee..Simply devine place, 14km of trek, newly developed way, from where autos start is less steep & 2km short then the old one. Don't forgot to eat ""Rajma Chawal"" from restaurants run by shrine board. Darshan is all we want."
277,Most Divine ! Most Enriching!,"There are three ways from Katda to reach Mandir. It is 14 KM away. You can have a blessings for health , wealth and prosperity. From Jammu By bus, Train or Helicopter. Amenities are provided at moderate rate by temple committee. Bhairon Temple is 4 KM higher then Mandir."
278,Jai Mata Di,Visited for darshan of Maa Vaishno Devi. The place is famous for this purpose only. Make sure you are fully prepared if you plan to climb to the temple walking. It would need lot of time and strength depending on your capacity to walk.
279,Bulawa aa gaya..,"Recently visited this shrine on 07-08.03.18. first tip one can collect Yatra parchi online or at katra bus stand or at airport. Banganga (starting point of the journey) to Ardh kumari- 6kms, it takes 3 hrs to reach wt moderate speed. We started our journey at 2 pm.

280,The bestest holy place i ever visited in my life,We went for vaishno mata darshan. Weather was extreme but it was totally enjoyable as we could feel the chilly weather on the mountains.
281,The Holiest Shrine,"The temple premises are very peaceful, and very clean too,it was not that crowded in April before navratras, Must Visit!!"
282,Pure Spirituality....,You know what this place is to us hindu devotees and I need not say anything but to complete the 100 letters I am writing this.
283,Family tour,"Most important religious place in India.  People from every part of India visit there.  People visiting through out the year in every weather.  Vaishno mata shrine situated at 5200 feet from sea level.The length of the trek is around 13 Km from the starting point, which is Ban Ganga.Pony, Palkis and Pithus are available at starting point, Ardh Kuwari, you can hire any of these facility if you can not trek on your own.  Lot of shops are available on the trek for refreshment. In normal scenario (depends on your stamina)  you can complete the trek in 6 to 8 hours on your own feet.  If you use pony (hours) trek can be complete in 3.5 to 4 hours.Before darshan at shrine you have to deposit all your bags, mobiles any item made of leather in the locker room.  During crowded days the queue for the locker room took around 4 to 6 hours.  We visited in 3rd week of December, crowd was a bit less as compare to 4th week of December. During this time it took around  2 hours for darshan in shrine.I visited first time with my family, it was  fantastic trip."
284,Jai Mata Di,One of the most spiritual place in the India.Went 3rd Time and this time with friends.This place has something which gave me that energy to complete the full journey even with fatigue.The Trikuta hills from Katra Chowk is very Beautiful and there are lots of things available for purchasing.
285,Epitomises faith ,We frequent go to vashno devi.. mata fullfill all your prayers... very good track and we can find everything for drinking and food ...
286,Jai Mata Di,"Hello, Everyone today I am sharing my review on temple Sri Mata vaishnodevi at Katra. Being resident of Jammu & Kashmir I frequently visit Sri mata vaishnodevi to get blessings from Goddess. I travel with my friends to reach at vaishnodevi bhawan we trek 12 km and 1.5 km more for Baba Baironath. Our visit at vaishnodevi was so peaceful and enjoyable. We did darshan of sri mata vaishnodevi at night an the view of bhawan was incredible. Also the view katra from Trikuta mountain was amazing at night."
287,"Jai Mata di, Visited many times",The place is located at trikota hill range situated in katra  distt of Udhampur. It is about 45km from Jammu and takes about one hours drive in own car.We can use the public transport like buses and tempos which are available in abundance from Jammu busstand. It is a highly devotional place for Hindus. A must visit place.Jai Mata Di.
288,Must visit,"Vaishno devi is heaven I am not saying anything about this palace but management is too bad.. On a single track horses, palki, walkers are moving so it become very default for people who use to go by walking.. There is too much dirty. People n horses are not let the place clean. They throw junk here there everywhere. There was also power cut happened in night for half an hour. I dont know what kind of management it was there was rain and no light everywhere was dark it can be reson of any accident b/c all stairs was wet and slippery. And there is no light.and horses were also running on the same track."
289,Jai Mata Ki,Fantastic Trip..... I visit vaishno devibtemple every year and love this place.  Mata Rani se jo mango MIL jaata hai.  Jai Mata di.  Only 1 request we should plant more trees here as I see the tress are depleting day by day.

291,Pooja,You go here and get your wishes fulfilled. Govt has put in lot of hard work and has provided lots of facilities for the devotees. One can reach Katra by road or rail and thereafter to temple which is 13 km on foot or pony or palki or helicopter. There are battery operated vehicles where helicopter drops you. Amazing and serene place
292,Darshan every year,Mandir's as usual are divine! Must visit place.. There are 2 VD mandirs - This one is in Jammu town.. There are some small temples in the temple area
293,Summer Holidays Devotional trip,"Had a great darshan of mata rani. All type of facilities are available on the way. You can go from horse , holicopter or by foot"
294,Jai mata di,"Jai Mata Di. This season was comparatively has few visitors, as I was told. I started my jurney from The White Hotel Katra at 7 PM in the evening and on the way I got yatra slip. The counters were less crowdy and I got it done in less than five minutes. The car from the hotel drop me at the main gate at around 7.30 pm. As I solo I decided to go on foot and walked in a brisk speed and had  too many short stays. I way is ok and I was never alone as there were thousand devotee were chanting Jai Mata Di. There is too many toilets and small shops so you will never have any problems for foods and drinks. I reached Audhkumari at around 11.30 pm and got the ticket for the visit there. Without wasting any time I started my yatra to Bhawan. I reached Bhawan at 1.15 PM. I cleaned myself and changed my clothes before the visit to Mata Vaishnodevi. There was cloak rooms where you need to keep your bags, mobiles and other electronic items, your belts and shoes. Even you to keep the wallet there. But you can cary some of your cash during darshan. By 2 AM I have completed my Darshan as there was no rush at that time. I collected my things from cloak room and went to tea shop and had  small bites there. By this time I was too tired and the way to Vaironbaba was difficult one so I decided to do my rest yatra on horseback."
295,Amazing experience yatra,"It is a holy deity in the north worshipped by all Hindus. We were a group of four ( aged 51/44/37/35yrs). Did a night trek for the span of thirteen Kms. The entire trek to Mataji temple and further to Bhairav temple and back was for exactly 12 hrs. We started around 1930 hrs in the evening, and walked all the way to and fro. Few tips for the trek.Crowd is less during the night hours.Beware of the horse and ponies used for man and material transport. Left side on the way is recommended.It is very windy and cold in the night hours. Ensure warm clothing.It may rain sometimes. Though the entire path is covered with sheds, there are intermittent spans left open to sky.The entire path way is paved and cemented. Do take the ramps and elderly for sure should take the ramps rather than the steps.Do not carry unnecessary things along with you. Every additional gram of weight would make you realize how heavy it becomes when you are two three kms away from the Mataji temple.Horse back is advisable for those who cannot walk. It is up to the entrance area of the temple.Chopper is available to an extent but you cannot avoid a trek of two and a half km, even if you get dropped by a chopper( Day time only)Wear Comfortable shoes so that you have no trouble during the trek.A walking stick is advisable and very helpful. At the entrance you can buy one. Chose thicker ones, which could give firm support.Keep a water bottle along with you, but if not, they are available on way uphill.You have food joints in between. It is preferable to have light dinner before you start the journey.Toilets are located at various locations intermittently.Do not buy Prasad for the deity because monkeys will not allow you to do so. Prasad is available at a cost of INR 50 just before the entrance.You have remove shoes/ wallets/socks, keep aside bags and mobiles. They can be securely kept in the free lockers provided. IF required you may carry your own lock and key if you feel so, otherwise lock and key is provided.We started at 1930hrs and reached mataji temple at 1230 hrs at a steady pace not too fast but normal walking speed. Form The Temple to Bhairav it takes two hrs and then the return journey from 0300 hrs to 0730 hrs.Downhill is a major challenge when you feel the pain in your legs and the last two kilometers test your endurance. Every step taken would make you recite Jai Mataji. What so ever short cuts you may feel to adopt using the steps, refrain yourself from doing that. This may result in tremendous leg pain after/during the trek.Walking sticks keeps the monkeys away. In oiur group on the return we had ensure that the guy carrying the Prasad was between the group. The front and the rear guys wielding walking sticks whenever we came across a monkey or group of monkeys.Blood pressure and diabetes patient should take advice of Medical officers, before they plan for the trek.Pain relief tablets would be helpful once you are back to Katra. You would surely need them.It is difficult to find a horse on the return journey in night hours, unless you hire it from the Mataji temple. Buy: Cashew nuts/ Badams/Keshar/Lasan/ you can fing good quality stuff in the market.Shiv khori the famous cave is eighty Kms form Katra. ( two and from eight kms walk)Travel plan. Flight to Jammu; Hire a cab form Jammu to Katra so that by 1700 hrs you are in Katra. Take rest, freshen up, take light dinner and start the trek. It is advisable to negotiate the Cab for retrun jouirney to Jammu which is cheap. The drivers will ask you because they do not want to come back empty, and there is a union which allocates the taxis at Jammu. Drivers get a turn in two or three days hence they try to ensure the return the journey also. (Small negotiation can be done with the drivers to take lesser fare as compared to the journey to Katra)"
296,Mataji is Dharshan March 2018,"With God's grace, we got a chance to visit Vaishno Devi mandir last year July. Walking path is good and with company of people, one can walk in 5-6 hours. After half distance, one can also take electric rikshaw to reach upside near the temple. The darshan queue was longer and one needs to take prior appointment/timing for the darshan. It's recommended to take it at Katra itself. Food joints are available throughout the journey. Horses are available for people who may face difficulties in walking.Jay Mata Di."
297,Jai Mata di,"The 12 odd Kms trip to visit the shrine of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, is performed by many with utmost devotion and spiritual feeling though reached by various means.... walking is the most common .. over the years facilities have been provided and improved for elderly and infants to travel along...."
298,Jai mata di.,"Great experience visiting Maa Viashno Devi shrine. (Traveled December 3rd, 2016 and had clear sunny weather)Took Shakti Express train in evening from Delhi-Katra. Train is clean and Katra train station is  very clean and well maintained. Reached Katra early morning so checked into a hotel near station.Took hotel van to Niharika complex. PIcked up helicopter tickets from there which we had bought before hand.  It comes with darshan parchi.Took hotel van to helipad.Helicopter takes you to Sanjichaat. (4 minute safe ride)2.5 km walk from Sanjichaat to Bhawan. You can buy prasad close to reaching the bhawan. After amazing darshan of Maa, we took pony from Bhawan to Bhairon baba then back to helipad. Lines were not long during December.Took train back from Katra at 10.30 pm back to Delhi next morning.Carried 1 sweater and a light jacket which was enough for the journey."
299,the heaven on the earth,We started at around 4 PM from our hotel and reached on the top @ 10 pm. Although the journey was tiring but the view from the top was awesome. Would suggest others to start early in the morning so that you can come back to your hotel on time. When we come back from top it was already 4 AM and all the autowallahs were demanding 300rs for 2 km ride. Would advise to come back before it gets dark else autowallahs will charge a huge amount or make some arrangement on the top only for night.
300,Very special,"Business trip and the call from the mata ka mandir came unexpected, and i got to have the darshan after 11 years of long wait and worship."
301,trip worth remembering for-ever.,There is energy at this place which which gives positiveness in life . visit Mata ji's Shrine every year if i get chance
302,Awesome,"One of the most magnetic religious place that you can ever visit. Please come & do Darshana with family as safe.Now trip has been made much easier with multiple facilities that government has provided like: Train direct to Katra, Horses, Helicopter, Auto on charai & well connected roads.Plus you can enjoy food, shopping & sight seeing in & around Katra with Mata ke darshan..!!Jai Mata Di..!!"
303,Jai Mata Di,Nice trip. The place is very good. But during navratras there is long queues for locker room as well as for darshan.
304,jai mata di,"I am a devotee of Mata Vaishno Devi and  freequently visit Mata's Darbar. This is one place which gives me complete peace of mind. So blessed to visit this place every year. Some times 2-3 times a year. This time could do the darshan through the old holy cave. It is only open only for a month between Jan-Feb. Arrangements for pilgrims are good. Beware of paying extra to ponies, pitthoos and palkiwalas. Remember to take yatra parchi. Its easier to book it only through Mata Vaishno Devi website. Also if you want to book a helicopter, you will have to book two months in advance. And tickets are gone with 5 mins of the ooening of quota. So you have to be on your toes. Booking for helicopter ooens at 10 am 2 months before the travel date. Total yatra is more than 30 kms up and down if you walk on your feet and include Bhairao Baba's darshan, which is a must to complete your yatra. Don't forget to do kanjak after coming back from yatra."
305,Pure bliss,When you visit Vaisno Devi Temple You have a very positive vibrations and you are in a different world..The place is the Maha Sagar of Hindu Faith.Excellently managed by the trust with all facilities on the way to temple.Special Aarti is a special event for life time.Must visit place for all
306,Jai Mata DI - Mata Bulati Hai Tabhi Hum jaa Paate Hain. Jaikara Sherawali Da......,Mata Vaishno Devi is holy place for Hindus. This is a place where you find unlimited peace inside you. All the facilities which are required for the pilgrimage are available here. Must visit and feel the peace.
307,Unique experience,we are blessed to have visited mata vaishno devi temple and would continue till we can to take her blessings...
308,How to go with less hassle,"Start early morning from Katra and go upto Ardhquari on mules and have Breakfast. Thereafter, move up gradually, take rest and go for darshan. After darshan, do not rush to come down. Descend slowly ensuring not to give pressure on your knees. Keep having lot of liquids and mini meals/ snacks during the journey. Moving by mules will reduce your walk by about 6 km. But still you would walk about 18.5 km. If you have not been exercising/ walking, take care as above. this will ensure pain is not induced in the legs due to long walk."
309,No words can describe the feeling ,"Amazing helicopter ride with Himalayan company they were prompt, safe and very good. Comfortable and easy ride to Vaishno Devi! The temple itself is legendary is very clean and there are so many people to help! Jai mata di"
310,Jai mata di!!!,One of the best temple treks in India. Start in the evening do that you reach by night and escape the scorching sun. After darshan return slowly while enjoying nature.
311,Vaishno Devi Mata temple ,"This place is now very well managed by the local administration and Board members, Pony/horse vendor will ask  you more price than qouted, but refrain to pay them more"
312,Holi place,"Pilgrims come to this place from throughout India,Nearest railway station is Katra,where numbers of trains has been extended from jammu to Katra. For Vaishno devi there is treaking of about 13 Km.Horses & palkies are available on hire.Also there is Halicopter service from katra to Sanjichat which is  just walking distance to temple.Full track from katra to Vaishno devi is tiled,where can easily track & enjoy the journey Enroute to temple there are good shrine board cafetarias  where meal is also served at very reasonable rates"
313,JAI MATA DI ,"Superb place and amazing devotees trust in goddess. People climb hill generally from night. But we climbed in morning 8 am. Get down around 8pm. 14km it is but very good place. U can have rain , cold and feel heat also. Bhairav temple is 2km away from vaishnodevi temple. This trek is high and tough also. Superb place at bhairav temple. Very nice facilities provided by temple organising committee. Helicopter facility is also available for easy darshan or who didnt want to climb the hill. superb place and must visit once. Also nearby places are pattnitop, shivkhodi."
314,Mata Vaishnav Devi,"Ma vaiahno Devi gives you all the strength to climb up all 14 km stretch with no pain, so many pilgrims are walking with you and its quite happy surrounding out there. Ride with ponies have it's own thrill, don't forget to bargain before hiring you can get pony till ardhkuwari in 400. Although New path is now open till ardhkuwari which is only for yatri and batteries run vehicle operated by shrine board. So if you want to take the journey by foot take new path and then path from himkoti. Board has created resting point, food point in almost every km of journey. Took train to reach uptown katra Shri Shakti and uttar kranti, prefer Shri Shakti. Hotel are cheap starting 500."
315,Jai maa vaishno devi,"This review is to help any devotees who wants to walk all the way to Vaishno Devi Shrine. Me and my mother (61 years old) took the walk in the month of August 18. We started the walk in the afternoon and total walk from the start point to the Shrine was 15.26 kms (using the new road) and we covered the distance in 4:48:36 hours. Few advices 1) Carry spare set of cloths (To change as it gets really sweaty), 2) Eat light food before the walk 3) Drink plenty of fluids on the way. 4) First 6 KMs are bit difficult so walk at a slower pace and take rest in between. 5) Try to keep a steady pace, refer to attached pics and it would give a fair idea about the walk and elevation.Overall if you are involved in some daily physical activity this walk wont be a problem."
316,JAI MAA VAISHNO DEVI,"Vaishno devi temple is a hindu temple. It involves a trek of 12 km from the city to reach vaishno devi bhawan. After the bhawan, there is a further trek of 3 km to reach bhairo mandir. It is a holy place, however too many ponies on the way disrupt the trek and reduce the enjoyable experience. Secondly, there are lack of decent places to stay on the way so you will have to complete the journey on one stretch. Another problem is lack of good restaurants near the bhawan. There are few restaurants and the crowd is in excess, it is better if you pick up something on the way from ardhkuwari, which is the half way."
317,Jai Mata di,"We reached Katra at 7:00am and put our luggage into hotel cloakroom. We reached Banganga at around 8:00am. From there we started the climb. We took many breaks during our journey and reached Bhawan at 4:30pm. Got our yatri parchi stamped before main bhawan entrance. Took the Prasad and got refreshed after that we deposited our belongings in cloakroom. It was already about 6 pm and we got to know that Aarti will start so entry in the temple will be blocked till 8 pm. It was very cold and we were walking barefoot, very hard to spend 2 hrs. We had dinner and we again went in the queue at 9 pm. By that time all the crowd was gone. We did the darshan and came out at 10:30 pm. Went straight to Dharamshala to get blankets, you have to deposit 100 rupees per blanket which will be refunded once you give blanket back. All shaded places were occupied so we had to spend whole night in open area, it was really difficult because of the harsh weather. Pros:Awesome experience of climbing, you will enjoy the route.Food is cheap and tasty.No beggers on the way, also donation is not mandatory.Main temple and cave is amazing.Thrilling view from above.Cons:Lot of rush on the way.Horse and mules have made place dirty most of the way is shared by human and horses and it becomes really irritating at times.There is not much place at top to stay comfortably in the night.Aarti is done 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening which completely blocks entry, at times crowd becomes unmanageable."
318,Holy Darshan ,"Successfully completed pilgrimage to Vaishnodevi. It was done in the traditional sequence. The pilgrimage took exactly 24 hours to complete by walk for a total of 28 kms.We started the pilgrimage from Katra at 6.00 pm in the evening. First, we visited a place called Ardhkuwari which is at an altitude of 4800 ft above sea-level. Here we passed through the narrow cave opening of the Garbh Joon cave. We had to crawl or rather slide through it. It took around 8 hours to complete the darshan here. It was around 4.00 am then.  However, It was a truely awesome experience and worth the wait. Next, we visited Maa Vaishnodevi temple at Bhawan early in the morning at sunrise. It is at an altitude of 5200 ft above sea-level. It was a blessed moment of my life. I am very impressed with the serene atmosphere and the feeling that one gets on visiting this sacred place.The final destination was a visit to Baba Bhaironath temple without which the pilgrimage is not considered complete. The temple is situated at 6700 ft above sea-level. We returned to the base at Katra at 6.00 pm on the next day.We started our return journey at 11.00 am and reached the base at Katra around 5.00 pm.The chilly and freezing weather was a challenge especially as we are not used to such a cold climate and high altitudes. Added to that the long ascending walk for 14 km and especially the steep descend during our return journey was to be frank very tiring. But the satisfaction of completion of the pilgrimage is overwhelming and makes you forget all your tiredness.Nevertheless, it was an amazing experience. The feeling that one gets after the successful completion of the pilgrimage makes the challenging journey truely satisfying.Worth mentioning are the facilities provided by the Maa Vaishnodevi Shrine board to make the journey easier for the pilgrims. They certainly deserve an appreciation.A soothing hot water shower followed by some hot milk with turmeric before going to bed made was a perfect finish to the tour.Jai Mata Di."
319,Jai mata di ,This is the Place where one must visit. This is very amazing place. Mata Vaishno Devi is the place where people are active and surrounded with green trees and shrubs.
320,Goddess Blessings one should get once in life,"Maa Durga residing on top of the mountain,a walk of 13.5 kms from Katra and people walk all the way,it is the Shakti given  by her that you can do it,even helicopter service is available but even after that it is a long walk and I assure you wthout her blessings you can not even do that much walk.But once you reach the abode all your tiredness just vanishes,you get a sudden strength that washes all your tiredness,the people are blessed with Maa generosity and be assured that you will receive even more than you wished for.People old not fit can acail of a palki carried by 4 people to take you to the doorstep so you can avail Darshan,aa has blessed those carriers the strength to carry people so they can also avail HER blessings.Try to go"
321,Not to be missed.,One of the cleanest and well planned places in India. Religion flow in the air. I have been 4 times here. Still feels refreshing
322,Jai Mata Di,"It has always filled me with excitement, whenever we plan a trip to Mata Vaishno Devi Temple in the city of Katra. It's best to climb up during the night time according to me. This city glows and shines till dawn."
323,Jai Mata Di,Its always a Divine Experience to visit Maa Vaishnodevi. This is our 6th time visit to vaishnodevi. Climate was cool plesant. All facilities by Shrine Board are good. JAI MATA DI
324,Jai Mata Di ,I was visit this place with my family members.We enjoyed there a lot.it is 14 km path to reach temple.it take your whole day to reach the temple.your Darshan complete after you Darshan at mahdev temple which exist at 1000 stair after vaishno Devi temple.there is so many horse to take you to the temple and cost is to hire the horse is 2000-3000.i advise you to hire horse to reach the temple because it's good.
325,Nice palace,"I went here first time for the darsan of mata with my family, that was very amazing experience, i wish i'll go again to Darbar."
326,Feeling Blessed and happy,Visited this temple after 25 years and what a change since then. It was a great experience and good to go just a day before Navratri in End September when there is less crowd and could have a very nice darshan.The battery cars operating there are the worst driving at high speed and with constant honking when others are walking to reach the temple. The temple administration should put a stop to this or rein in these battery car drivers.
327,"Decent visit , but my expectations were more",Holy place!It was an awesome experience.We booked a helicopter to Sanjhichat but VIP darshan are provided only to those that have the return helicopter ticket for the same day.
328,JAI MATA DI,"Temple of Vaishno Devi is said to be famous temple in North India, Overall arrangements from the Shrine Boards are good, Full track from Katra to Vaishno Devi is good."
329,Jai mata di,Vaishno Devi place is very well maintained and clean. There are many good food places like Sagar Ratan etc.
330,devi darshan,"It's awesome to come to Mata VAISHNO Devi every time! For bookings to be done for helicopter,  visit their site matavaishnodevi.com."
331,"""Saache Darbar Ki Jai""",Mata Vaishno devi - Bhaan - to feeel the place one has to be there - its eternal - its extraordinary - its wow - chalte jao aur log kehte rahenge bas thoda sa door
332,jai mata di,"Lovely devotional atmosphere, had a great darshan of Matha Di. Enjoyed trekking. Horse ride was amazing"
333,Jai Mata Di,"Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board has made tremendous efforts  to make the journey convenient. Nice and clean tracks from katra to Bhawan is great.  Clean toilets every 1-2 kms. Helicopter, Ponies, Palkies all available. Jai Mata Di bolo and chalo."
334,A must visit for all devotees of Maa,Management authorities of this temple is very good and approachable.we had an excellent dharshan.we enjoyed the helicopter trip to temple.overall good in maintanence.people from south should go with proper thermal wears/sweaters else we can't manage the chillness over there...
335,Jai mata di,Its was amazing experience and great blessings of mata rani. excellent weather conditions and so many facilities are there.
336,Jai mata di,"Thought of sharing some tips from our recent trip to Mata's heavenly abode -a) The trains from Delhi (even those coming from Andaman!) which earlier use to terminate at Jammu, now come all the way till Katra (foothill of the mata vaishno's darbar/shrine/bhawan). The station facilities by IRCTC (lodging, restaurants, shopping etc.) is truly remarkable. Make use of it! A pat on railway engineers' back for constructing & maintaining this architectural marvel of a rail network connecting Jammu with Katra.b) The helicopter pad is about 20-mins auto/rickshaw drive from the Katra station. Though we had pre-booked one-way online for the helicopter service, the operator was giving priority to those passengers who had booked a return ticket too. This totally made the time slots you had booked for oneline useless. There are two helicopter services operating from the helipad, but I guess only one is integrated with Shrine Board official site for online booking.c) As for the stay at the Bhawan (on top), we would certainly recommend shrine board's Gauri Bhavan booked online via their portal. Overlooking the sanctum sanctorum, it is a very affordable, clean, well maintained accommodation for both small and large groups.d) If you have elders travelling with you, you can take the e-rickshaw to cover half the climb/dissent. Very useful service."
337,vaishno devi darshan,"Temple is very devotional , after darshan felt very happy and satisfied.one poor thing is wash rooms are not at all maintained and doli and pony Wallas will cover like insect's for savaari.Temple board should give token system for these ridings so that devotees should not face troubles"
338,Vaisno Devi Darsan,Very crowded and have to wait for 1hr to get locker during aarti time. Rest all very good and amazing view from top.
339,Chalo Bulawa aya hai,"Well ,Amazing Hindu temple ,no example than other temple ,Very great Godess Vaishno-Devi temple ,we have been three time Trikuta mountain temple vaishno-devi there we felt very peace ,two time we have been with our family in september ,but first time we have been in june month ,we was  reached there 2;30 A.M we never forget unlimited over crowd no place was facilities  before washroom bath place before que Line for temple,You must go to very far to bath{ only one place} not water comes properly must rush to first bath my wife bath in male bathroom because ladies bathroom was like pushing each other to first bath {the bath place shuld be before Que -Line} & come back again for put your things in Locker ,Any way Locker was full we was stand two Hours in locker line{ should be one more Locker not enough one Locker for like this crowd} & then we came to 5;00 am to que Line for temple The Que-Line  was till bhairo climb the people pushing in line only two policeman controlling to all ,Aprox 5:30 temple closed for Aarti & open Again 8'0clock again open temple slowely line start to go we reached 11'0 clock for derson ,And we also went Bhairo temple ,Any way we was felt very poor management near by temple Aria ,otherwise on the way very happy journey very enjoyed  tour thanks ,the reason behind of this review if management must read this review & can manage better this is possible to continue step by step First Bath place & then one more Locker and then they leave people to Que-line to better management ,Thanks Bolo Vaishno-Mata ki Jai ,Jai mata Di"
340,Religious Trip,"Finally reached the darbar, i guess ""mata ka bulawa"" aaya tha. And i was blessed being there. Although took the helicopter to the top (a little tight on time), and being an off season we didn't face much rush. The ride was awesome and one way trip cost around 1700-1800 per head. Then you've to walk around 3 km to reach darbar. And man the aura was inexplicable."
341,Maataji darshan,"I am lucky that i visited this divine place more than 10 times. Every time i feel the same. 13 km walk to the Mata ka bhawan and bhairo baba temple will give you an unforgettable experience. Way is full of shops and 24 hour open. Rajma chawal & kadhi chawal available in the trust shops are good. Old people have option to take tattu, horses and palki. Also helicopter service is available. Must recommended holy place."
342,Nice palce,The greatest temple of mata rani. Great place for worship. It is so religious and adventures. Me and my friend 1st time goes to vaishno mata we are so much enjoy this trip. Local market is good but somethings bad. there are hourses to carry you helicopter svices also available nowdays. Blankets and locker available for public. Hotel and rooms are available on economic and lowest price at katra bus stand. I think everyone should go to mata and enjoy most adventures and religious trip.
343,PANKAJ SHARMA,"also visit near by places when go their. in last fiver years after darshan visited shiv khori, patnitop, sanser, manser lake n many places from katra to shiv kori"
344,Awesome place,"Visited Maa Vaishnodevi darshan with wife and kids (6 & 4) in the 1st week of June. We started our trek at 9pm as the daytime weather was very hot.Please take online Yatra Parchi, it's much easier than taking it from the counter, and carry the copy with an photo ID.Most of the hotels can take Yatra Parchi on your behalf as they have the IDs during checkin.There are strict guidelines about things you can carry.kindly check online and follow it.Advisable not to carry anything with you if you want to save the time and pain of finding the locker at Bhuvan.Kindly plan well in advance and book the Helicopter or simply walk the trek.There are 3 options if you don't want to walk, Horses, Pitthus(people carrying your luggage and kids) & Palkhi( for senior citizens) Horses, Pitthus and Palkhi charges are 1000‚Çπ 700‚Çπ & 4000‚Çπ respectively from Banganga to Bhuvan.These are standard rates set by the trust and put up at important places enroute.But all options charge more than that by giving various excuses.Journey by horses are very exhausting and painful. But even if you do,Always take bigger horses.All Horses will stop mid way for an hour for rest and food.There are few Options for food enroute so be full stomach and carry your own munchies in a disposable bag.The Bhuvan becomes crowded due to people sitting and sleeping anywhere and everywhere in the path.Bhairavnath darshan is a must and can be done easily in an hour's time.SVDK railway station is neat and clean.Charges from SVDK to Katra:Rickshaw 300‚Çπ Car 600‚Çπ+SUV 1200‚Çπ+You can visit Nau Mata Mandir, Dhaansar Baba, Siad Baba Waterfall & Shivkhori around Katra. All the places are beautiful & can be seen in a days time.Jai Mata Di"
345,Chalo bhulawa aaya hai ...mata ne bhulaya hai ,"One of the most satisfying experience....We were 5 couples and four children together , we started trek with ponies...all ladies and kids were there on pony while started on feet. Excellent arrangemnt of refreshment and food for yatris. Do bargain and be strict with pitthu and pony walas. They are cheaters."
346,Jai Mata Di,"Hello bhakto, vaishno devi great religious place. ... Vaishno Devi Mandir is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu Goddess located in Katra at the Takuta Mountains in Jammu and Kashmir."
347,The Holy Shrine,"Jai Mata Di! Awesome place to visit, i have visited twice and will going for 3rd time in september month. Very helpful people around, Really worth a visit."
348,Blissful Energy,"I am a Kolkata based retired person with a hobby of exploring the places which I should have set my foot on there earlier. Due to age factor & illness of my wife I could not take a decision to visit those places more adventurously which I dream to go there like others visit. For example, I could not visit Kedarnath on trekking from Gauri Kund, nor I could go to Jay Mata Di darshan on foot. So I have to find out the other ways to visit those places I always cherish in my mind. I fancied wandering there, beyond my abilities. Still I try & find ways & means, though it appears to be costly. Earlier I could not succeed long back, I returned home disheartened but the latent desire in me encourages finding out the solution to fulfill my dream.  After all, it is said that until & unless Mata calls, the dream will remain incomplete. Thus I decided to avail the helicopter service arranged by the Shrine Board. The arrangement is no doubt very helpful. Now I will try to share some tips for my fellow travelers/ religious minded people/ enthusiastic tourists/ nature lovers, the Heli service from Katra to Sanjichhat.Getting there-From Kolkata there is no direct train to Katra. Kolkata people have to end their journey at Jammu, the city of temples & forts. There after you have to select your mode of transport either by train to Katra or bus or private car (48km). But it was in my mind that our PM inaugurated the journey from Katra  Rly way station on 04.07.2014 and I had a plan to go direct by train to Katra avoiding other modes. I searched one train (New Delhi Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra- Shri Shakti Express -22461) from New Delhi at 5.30pm except on Thursday for Katra & it reaches there at 5.10am the next day in the early morning. This train is all AC & generally punctual. The newly introduced SMVDK   Rly Stn is a very neat & clean station with many facilities like, Broad Gauge/ Escalator/ lift/ramp/ stairs/ three platforms/ IRCTC run retiring rooms/AC hotel/Shopping lounge/multi Cuisine restaurant/ Cloak room/ Waiting Hall/Book stall/ vast parking lot/ etc. The down train 22462 starts at 10.55pm from Katra & reaches New Delhi at 10.45am, the next day. You will be charmed to get down at the early morning on the clean platform, take the escalator & come out from the station. You will see the Trikut hills afar with lights still on.  You will take an auto from the auto stand & go to your hotel or guest house run by the Shrine Board. The arrangement is very good. You will be allotted your room on first come first basis. We stayed in Niharika Complex @ Rs.850/ per night. The room is spacious with hot water facilities and taken food from canteen inside. We visited on 21.04.2016. From here you will get auto for Heli Pad , 2.5km away, on a hill @ Rs.100/ per head. But you are to book your room online. There is always rush, you will not get any room if not booked in advance on line.There is a lot of review on Mata Vaishno Devi Yatra or Pilgrimage.  Katra is the base camp for the yatra. Your pilgrimage should be registered on line. You will have to collect a Yatra Parchi beforehand. But Helicopter yatries need not collect the parchi which will be delivered from the Sanji Chhat Helipad as a VIP yatri. After taking bath & breakfast we took an auto for the heli pad. We face two tier security checks. We showed our online tickets & the visa card (in our case we booked journey tickets through VISA Card) you can do it by Credit card also. The thing is that you are to show your Dr./Cr. Card in original along with the ID proof. We did through PAN card. After checking we were to  move to waiting lounge a little ahead. There are two offices side by side for two different heli services as per contract with the SMVDSB, viz, i) Global Vectra Helicorp.Ltd & the other ,ii) Himalayan Heli Services  Pvt. Ltd. We booked two tickets with Himalayan Heli at 2.10pm slot from Katra for forward journey only. We reached there at 11.00am with a hope that the authority might allow us to board in chopper before the scheduled time. But the day was very crowded, no scope. After repeated requests, the booking official asked us if we had our return tickets. My reply was ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. He advised to buy the return tickets & be allowed to go immediately. We followed his advice as we changed our decision to return by walking. We were asked to go for security checking, when we completed the formalities like weighing, ID proof, online tickets etc & offered boarding pass. Generally 5/6 passengers are allowed to board in one go provided the total weight should not cross the limit plus 10kg each for luggage per passenger is allowed. We enjoyed the vistas of the Katra city from the helipad on a hill & heard the noise of journey of the choppers in every 10 min. alternatively. It will take 5-8 min. to land at Sanjichat helipad at 6200 ft.As soon as we came out from the restricted area we took our VIP pass for entry to the Bhawan in Gate-5 managed by army personnel.  Now our journey for 2.5km-3 km from Helipad to Bhawan starts, just a little lower level. We started walking with comfort on the good road , more or less plain, covered with shed to protect from sun, rain, & frequent stone falling. On the way you can rest a while, take tea, snacks, drinking water. At times ponywalas are moving with the yatri. We took about 1 hour to reach at the gate.Here we observed the Bhawan/ Durbar of Mata  in white colours on the opposite hills at an altitude of 5200ft. The yatries are to  trek 13 km from Katra to reach Bhawan. It is believed & felt strongly that , once called by Mata, his or her journey gets completed with Her blessings. If not called , no one can enter the Durbar, even if reaching there. If you have faith, you will feel Her blessings. Slowly we at last reached at gate no-4 & were advised to deposit our footwear, leather belt, leather purse, pen,comb, camera, electronic items in a cloak room . We were given the keys & it is free of cost. Now we went ahead and reached in gate-5 for entry. We handed over the special parchi to the security man & followed the fellow yatri for the main entrance. At a certain point we were again under security check before the final entry to the cave. It will be clear here the original entry to cave, narrow, is no longer in use. But a new way to the gufa is opened for the darshan, the passage is 3-4 ft wide, clean,  both sides railing to hold & full of bells over head. Water is oozing out from the hills & is being carried through a channel. We followed our fellow yatri one by one until we arrived at the point to see the pindies. We were thrilled, our heart was beaming in joy & finally it is possible to bow down our head at the foot of Mata. We are blessed with the darshans of a five& a half feet tall rocks with three heads or the pindies which constitute the sanctum sanctorum of the holy cave. Here the Mata Vaishno Devi , represented as goddess incarnated as Maha Kali in the right, Maha Laxmi in the centre & Maha Saraswati in the left .Since we were to return by Helicopter , we were in a hurry & my wife insisted on hiring a pony to reach the Helipad at Sanjchat. We boarded the chopper at about 5.00pm and came back at Katra within a short while. The arrangement made by the Shrine Board is great. Please visit the official website of SMVDSBSome important information-i)	If  you are an aged yatri & decides to trek, check your health.ii)	Open SMVDSB official website & register yourself & have your credentials , username & password.iii)	Open the website just at 10.00am & login by your username & password.iv)	Keep ready with the information like PAN Card details, Member name, age, date of journey, sector ( Katra-Sanjichat or Sanjichat-Katra), preferred slot.v)	In my opinion, opt for early departure; you will get much time to stay there &  come back.vi)	You will keep ready the Cr./Dr.no, C V V no on the back of the card & expiry date for the transaction.vii)	If the Bank accepts the card, you will get a message.viii)	You should note down the transaction details.ix)	Passenger reporting is one hour before the shuttle departure. Stick to this strictly or you will be treated as No Show.x)	Keep your luggage bare minimum. (below 10kg.)xi)	You must carry your ID proof & Dr. or Cr. Card in original."
349,Improve Locker Facilities,"This is one of the holiest hindu shrine in entire India. Devoties gets there wishes fulfilled at the Darbar. The original ancient cave is closed for devoties as it is too narrow. A new cave was built by shrine board years ago so that devoties can eeasily able to get darshan. A dummy cave was also made by shrine board to cater the huge rush of devoties. Every year lakhs of devoties visits Maa Vaishno Devi. Devoties starts the journey of 12.5 km from Ban Ganga. Ponys/palki/pitthu are available on entire route. Helicopter service is also available from Katra to Bhawan and vice-versa. A lot of food stalls/tea are available en route. After Adhkuwari one can choose to continue on the new route (via Himkoti) which is 1 km shorter to Bhawan as compared to old route via Adhkuwari. Battery cars are also available for ladies/sick persons/senior citizens at start of new route. Still mostly devoties prefers to complete the journey by walking. Clock room facility is available at Bhawan, but one has to wait in que for around 1 - 2 hrs for the same. Rooms are also available on Bhawan managed by shrine board but you can get one only if you had a contact in shrine board, bcoz in shrine boards website it always shows non availability of rooms whenever you tries to book one."
350,Jor sae bollo JAI MATTA DI,"There are crores of Mata Vaishno Devi devotees visiting the shrine for glimpse of Mataji. One has to take a lot of pain to climb the Trikuta hill for feel of the real darshan. But after reaching, If someone wants to enjoy all facilities and quiteness, the month of february is ideal for darshan. In this month, most of the professionals, businessmen and government officials are too busy in conclusion of financial year. Students are preparing for exams hence the crowd is minimal and weather is nearly ideal as there is no extreme cold and heat. Just consider visiting in February if your conditions and time permits you."
351,Must visit pilgrimage,"Before started sharing my review I have already shared my vaishnodevi trip from the last year but this time I visit yesterday to Vaishnodevi again via new Tarakote route to vaishnodevi bhawan to bhairon temple and return to katra. Also I have received many questions regarding Tarakote route under my previous review so here I am sharing my review. I went to vaishnodevi with 3 of my friends from my home town Jammu city and this time we want to explore the new route which starts after the Banganga check post just next to Gulshan Kumar langar point. But before you go from tarakote route just keep one thing that you need to trek 2 km extra to reach Adhkuwari from this route but for photolovers this route is nice. Only advantage of going from here is You will see no ponies ride here. During your way to tarakote route here you will see 2 view point,1 multicolored fountain, 6 refreshment counters along with Cafe Coffee Day, neat and clean trek, easy available of drinking water and also neat and clean washrooms. So we started our trek at 8 pm and reached vaishnodevi bahwan at 12:30 pm and free from darshan by 2:30 am. We took rest for 30 minutes and start our trek to Bhairon Mandir at 3:15 am during our trek from VaishnoDevi bhawan to Bhairon mandir we saw the snow everywhere and we climb one stairs of 371 which starts from 500 above Vaishnodevi bhawan towards bhairon temple.  By the help of 371 stairs we reached bhairon temple in 30 minutes and after visiting bhairon temple we started our trek back to katra at 4:30 am and by 8:30 am we reach katra and after eating breakfast we catch bus for our home in Jammu city by 9:30 am. By 11 am I reached home. My experience was unbelievable and I enjoyed a lot. I have shared the image of starting tarakote route just after the Gulshan langar hall."
352,Devine,The Vaishno Devi Temple is really peaceful. It has a path of approximately 14 kms of slope. There are various options to reach the temple. Most of the people prefer to go walking. Others can choose going by horse as well. It is open 24*7. There is a queue to enter the temple.
353,Holy trip ,"its best to book your train tickets and hotel rooms well in advance as thousands of people visit this holy place in India, there is direct train to Katra  which reaches there in the early morning. One can also plan the visit by online registration for the accommodation, attending aarti or yatra parchi. Travel light and wear comfortable clothes There are lots of Tea stalls and dhabas where you can stop and rest. Also enjoy the beautiful views during your visit to the temple. We visited in February, it was best time as the weather was fine and less crowd."
354,Vaishno Devi ,Vaishnodevi temple has been considered most visited above Tirumala. In terms of experience devi energy is really very powerful and life sustaining.  Even from few kilometers one can feel strong sense of pulsating life energy.  No doubt animals and men doing hard work going up and down Bhawan dont feel tired as devi grace is life nourishing.  A must visit devi temple of North india.
355,"The temple is indeed holy and a beauty, but reaching there.........","From Mumbai take direct train to katra or by flight it's on you.if you really wanna enjoy then track 14 k.m of mountain climbing ,the track is well maintained with sheds,snack shops,benches and water very easy access. If you are tracking then start your track  in the eveningfrom katera so you will be reaching bhavan by late night and you can do darshan early in the morning and return back to karta.            But if you don't wanna walk helicopter option is there with very reasonable subsidized  rates. It's better,fast and economical also to take chopper instead of horse for track. You can book rooms also online on vashnomata site. Enjoy the hills and Mata vashno devi  blessing.well maintaned and organised by the govt. Must visit place for spiritual and if you are not then for the beauty of the mountains ."
356,New Year Night -Vaishno Devi,Its most visited shrine in Jammu and I recomend all to visit this shrine and all your wishes will come true. Jai mata di.
357,Amazing ...........,One of the Holy place Vaishno Devi Mandir people who love to visit a holy place visit the  Vaishno Devi Mandir
358,Fantastic weather,"There are 4 ways of going to this temple - walking , horse or pony ride pithoo dola or helicopter.If you have a return ticket on same day for helicopter the you get a VIP priority darshan pass which is a different queue and waiting time is less as compared to the other general queue.The darshan will be for 1-2 minutes inside as lot of crowds are there but the darshan is divine and you will feel mental peace after the darshan with spiritual cleansing.If you can afford then helicopter is the best as you can return early same day with the VIP pass darshan.If you go by horse pony then please bargain.katra is the centre to go to maa vaishno devi. stay in niharika complex as it the temple maintained shree maa vaishno devi trust run  . Do not forget yatra parchi because without that you will not be allowed for darshan at various check gates.There are good facilities for yatris and food and water points everywhere for people walking or going by horse pony.Please take a walking stick and comfortable walking shoes .High heels not recommended.Please avoid all leather items as these are not allowed inside the temple.Instead carry cotton jute bags.Lockers are available free of cost.If you want to stay and spend a day in the temple then there are places to stay run by the maa vaishno devi trust in the temple dormitory and rooms.availability is depending on peak season off season.You may book online from their website.Offerings can be given .If you donate please donate in the office of the temple or large boxes near the temple. Do not offer any money donations to priests.Take help of Army or CRPF personnel posted at different gates and check points as they are very friendly and guide you properly. Bargain with horse owners or pithoo dola owners before you board."
359,Jai Mata Di ,Lot people visit because of Aastha for just a look of Mata ..I really appreciate the Aastha inside but management is still not well managed.its like to find a heaven going from the hell.the unity of khachchar people don't want other people to walk smoothly on the pathways as lot of pushing and get aside as they don't know people who are poor walking.only they want their business..there is no question of Aastha for them.really poor management.
360,Amazing mountain temple in north India,"Really this is the supreme power which gave us the stamina and energy to trek up.  We started at 8pm by walk.  We really went slow.  After about 5 kms, it really got chilly as it was December mid.  It started raining as we reached about 9 kms.  But the divine power gave us strength to reach the mandir.  Walking back immediately was really strenuous.  I would not suggest walking back immediately.  Better to stay there for couple of hours, have some good food and then trek down.  We really froze while trekking down. Hence took very long to reach the foothill.  We reached back at 8am.  Virtually it took us 12 hours to go up and then come down.  Awesome arrangements through out the trek.  New road is  really good.  For those who want to do half-way trek, electric cars are available from Ardhkuvari."
361,Jai mata di,"Holy Hindu place. Fully facilitated, people go up to the holy place by climbing the hill themselves and chanting jai Mata Di. Lovelly experience."
362,Spiritual power of Mata Rani,A spiritual and religious place where every wants to go. Really a good experience. I reached Katra in morning time and I planned to take some fresh up after a long journey. I was with my family so I decided to start in evening due to hot weather in may month. We started at 6 PM and reached 2 AM in the Bhawan and at 4 AM morning I got blessed to Mata Vaishno Devi. After we go to Bhairav baba mandir. After the darshan we came back Katra and relaxed in a hotel. The food in Katra is cheap and good. Manoranjan dhaba is good place to eat in Katra a tasty food specially Dal Makhani wow superb taste. In karta every thing is in walkable distance.
363,Do I need to say anything...,Vaishno devi temple is considered to be one of the holiest place indeed. We also enjoyed the little rain showers and cool climate.
364,Jai Mata di,One should visit Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine to get blessing of Mata Rani. Wonderful trek of approx 13 kms with colourful stalls. Shelter for rest and food available from Shrine Board at no profit loss. Will do this again with whole family. Jai Mata Di üôè
365,Very Pleasant Yatra,"Vaishno devi is located in Jammu district in Jammu and Kashmir, Devotees from all over India visit here for the darshan of Maa Vaishno. Me, my wife, my mum and my brother taken the darshan of maa vaisho on 28th may 2019 around 4 am.To reach vaishno devi you have to climb a 12 km stretch from katra. First of all you have to get a yatra parchi from katra, then go to Banganga by auto and start the climbing.The experience of climbing can't be explained, it was surreal. all my family members were tired but after getting Darshan of Maa Vaishno we charged up.Every Indian must visit here and get blessed. JAI MATA DI"
366,scenic beauty ,Wonderful experience on visit to Mata Vaishno Devi...but too many horse riders asking to take up their services..
367,Holy Shrine,"This was my maiden trip to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi's shrine. I thought my review on TA can be helpful to those taking the helicopter service for the first time; so here goes:1) We had darshan scheduled on the recent Monday. We arrived at the Katra helipad at around 7.15 am for a 8.05 am chopper. We were weighed in a scale and issued boarding passes, and then driven up a small hill before sitting in a waiting hall.2) The wait wasn't too long - only 20 odd mins, after which we were ushered to the chopper. We had a return ticket booked for 11.35 am, but knowing we may not be able to make it on time, we had also got a back-up single ticket booked for much later. We chose to bear the cost rather than take the risk after coming so far.3) In addition, because of the return ticket, one gets entry through Gate No. 5, which is priority entry (i.e. you jump the normal queue for a headstart entry).4) Coming back to the chopper service - once you depart from the Katra helipad, its a swift (4-5 min) trip to Sanjhichhat. Before take off, we were well instructed to go to Room No. 3 at Sanjhichhat to take our yatra slip (yellow parchi giving us priority entry), then walk for 2 odd kms and locate Room No. 4 at Kalika Bhavan to get our locker, and subsequently seek entey at Gate No. 5.5) The walk from Sanjhichhat helipad to Kalika Bhavan is about 30-45 mins and mostly covered with a roof. One can also avail services of palkhi or ponies, by paying at the prepaid counters near the Sanjhichhat helipad. The hard working staff keep the route clean, with loudspeakera dotting the area and making announcements for the travellers.6) This was end April, so there was moderate rush closer to Kalika Bhavan. On reaching the Room No. 4, we were given a lock and key, to be used for any locker which may be open in the adjoining rooms. We put our cellphones, wallets and other leather items inside, before walking down to Gate No. 5.7) On entering through Gate No. 5, we noticed the other queues merging with us. This was end April, so the rush was moderate and manageable.8) After 30 to 45 mins, we walked inside a tunnel in which a queue in a single file could walk through. Credit to the gentleman who ensured the crowd kept to a single file inside the tunnel. Water oozed out of the bottom of the side walls inside the tunnel as we walked.9) We eventually came to the holy shrine in what is a truly blissful experience. After our darshan, and to soon accommodate those behind us, we swiftly moved forward and out.10) On our way to Kalika Bhavan, we had seen the signage for Bhairon ghati. So we walked closer to it, only to realize it did not have the cable car service for Bhairon ghati, the point for which we had left behind. We could see a large crowd  build up at lower levels of the mountain, for the cable car service. Perhaps better directions for this service may be helpful.11) As we were starting to tire, we hired the service of a pony and palkhi to go to Bhairon Ghati and then onwards to Sanjhichhat. Payment was done through the pre-paid counters. From there, Bhairon ghati was about 30 mins and once we reached there, the darshan was again very comfortably arranged. Credit to the panditji who refused any money to be left before him, and directed usage of the donation boxes.12) From there, we took the palkhi and pony to the sanjhichhat helipad which was another 30 mins or so, and the path has a few good 'view points'.  13) By the time we reached Sanjichhat helipad, we had missed our 11.35 ride back. So we used our later ticket. Apparently, if you are late by about an hour or so, they can still try to accommodate you.  If more late, you always run the risk of struggling to get seats, particularly in times of rush / sold out bookings.14) By the grace of Mata and Bhairon nath ji, all in all we had very good darshan. I was also impressed by the continuing efforts of support staff to keep the premises clean, as well as the informative loud speakers and well informed staff at the helipad. The return package for helicopter service can perhaps have a longer time window, just in case people want to cover other places of interest. Apart from that, this is a truly wonderful experience.  All the best to all travellers and Jai Mata Di!"
368,Mata Darshan ,This temple is located at the top of the hill. To reach here one can book helicopter or by walk or by riding horse or by cable car. Many shops are there to buy food stuffs when you will be walking to the temple.
369,Jai Mata di,This is my 35+ bulawa there by mata rani and j wish and pray to maa please call me every 6 months to darshan. Every time i come i saw good improvement by shrine board. Feel very safe and sound. Good security every where. But poniwalas asking for too much money no controlon them by government. They just write on boards and do some announcements about rates. But no poniwala following them.
370,Pilgrimage trip,What can u write here...Shrine board has managed the temple & premises in a correct way. Continuous shed & toilets. If board could keep up more food shops in the way & able to keep toilets clean 24 hours than u can't complaint a inch.
371,A yatra worth your faith & belief || Trust & experience coincidences yourself,"This was our 4th trip in last 20 years.  We went during Shradh and there was hardly 5 mins time took for Darshan. We took about 12 hrs to up down and darshan by walk with kids.  Devi temple definitely is one of the most powerful in North India and devotees have many stories to share of miracles.  Usually path to Bhawan is well maintained except for pony carriers which is lot of hassle and dont follow any traffic  rules.There must be separate lane for ponies and people walking. GOD forbid if pony hits or stamps it could be a very unpleasant  experience. Avoid stairs going up as, joints will take the toll. If you want quick darshan, helicopter  is good choice but weather can pack up any time so be take call on that. Plus helicopter is always jam packed,  so be prepared for delays.  Pony ride is ok but keep soft cushion on the back. Small kids Pithoo is the best.  I would suggest to avoid food at all locations,  even the best ones near bhavan. Unhealthy food can spoil  all goodness of spiritual journey. Overall a good and fortunate trip!!"
372,Jai Mata di...thank u for calling us there,"I visited the Vaishno Devi Mandir last week after almost 25 years. A number of new facilities have since been introduced to facilitate the Yatra.The commendable ones are1. Yatra Parchi at the airport2. Pre paid taxi at Jammu airport for Katra3. Pre paid three wheeler service from Katra Bus stand to Ban Ganga 4. Pre paid mule rides from Ban Ganga and from various other points along the way.5. Covered and well made walking tracks for most of the way.6. Metal railings dividing the tracks for segregating pedestrian and mule traffic for     most of the way7. Tall fencing on the exposed side of the trails to provide a much needed safety      barrier and  prevent any accidental falls. 8. Constant sweeping away of mule droppings to keep the paths clean.9. Katra boasts of one of the most clean and modern looking railway station in India     in close proximity to the starting point of the Yatra10.Alternate new track with low gradient Adhkuwari upwards for pedestrians and      battery operated carsSome new facilities that could have been fabulous but are terribly mismanaged are1.Helicopter service to Sanjhi Chchat.   Being peak winter, the crowds I was told were much less than usual and it being a    clear day I was really hopeful of securing a ride. But to my utter horror the    ticketing counter had people climbing over each other to get the tickets. I watched    the mayhem for an hour in the hope that some kind of order would be restored, a    queue would form and I would be able to buy a seat without getting trampled    upon... but it remained a madhouse and I just had to drop this option. 2.The Bus stand is in close proximity to the start of the Yatra... but is sadly a      messy, uneven and potholed space with buses standing haphazardly sharing      space with cows, stray dogs and some peddlars.     3. Battery operated cars from Adhkuwari to the Bhawan.    This is another service that could have been fantastic but again is completely      mismanaged. No one knows their running schedule and it remains a very      unpredictable and irksome system.  4. The bypass track for mules from Adhkuwari to the Bhawan (old track) has the      abutting mountain side littered with garbage and dirty kitchen water runoff from      the houses there which are probably Bhawan staff quarters. It is a smelly      abominable mess all through that stretch. Besides all of the above there also is a glaring lack of clearly visible signboards for directions and Yatri information.Now about the Bhawan area which basically comprises of a huge expanse of open spaces, covered and secured paths for the inevitable queues,some shops selling Prasad and souvenirs etc. and various other buildings with the main Mandir almost at the far end. Some problematic issues here are 1. The paving at the Bhawan is really intolerable to walk barefoot on and one has to      for a considerable distance. The problem is that there are very high      protrusions on the paving tiles and it almost feels like one is walking on pebbles.2. The locker facilities are another major sore point, reason being that one has to     queue up endlessly to get one. This only serves to create an irritating bottleneck,     wastes a lot of one's time and undermines ones' Darshan experience.3. For the pujaris to do the rituals for the sacred Aarti held twice a day at the    Sanctom Sanctorum or the Holy Cave, the Darshan is halted. Now another    thing that has started is a more than 2 hour live telecast of Kirtan that happens    in the main hall that is just outside the Holy Cave around the Aarti time. So    suspension of Darshan at each Aarti is now almost 2 and a 1/2 hours totalling a 5    hour Darshan halt each day,during which time the crowd keeps swelling outside    making the queues longer and longer. Some streamlining is definitely required to    minimize the duration of suspension of Darshan.    So till something is done about it by the management , if one is short of time I    would suggest that one reaches the Bhawan on lean days maximum by 4PM so    that one is not caught up till 8 PM or even beyond for Darshan.  Inspite of all these shortcomings I have given the temple visit 5 stars as the    spiritual experience of the Darshan is so beautiful that it cannot be described in    words."
373,Unbelievable ,We reached Katra on week days and we're very lucky to have Darshan through old cave. Hardly any people therefore we were allowed to stand in front of Mata for sometime to pray. Feel very blessed
374,Trip to Vaishno Devi in December 2017,"yes, maa vaishno devi listen to her devotees. good place to go for , if planing a spiritual tour.If you do not want to walk 14 kms, get helicopter ride."
375,Jhorse bolo Jai Mata Di,jai mata di this is a religious place in india and this place is also have natural beauty for nature lovers.....
376,Piligrim,"best temple in india to visit, located in the snow clad mountains and so many people are coming there to worship the goddess. Also the place is well developed now so there are hotels, restaurants and hospitals."
377,So well managed for crowds,We were a group of five friends on the way to explore Jammu and Vaishno Devi. We had reserved the train tickets till Jammu Tawi railway station. From Jammu you get many local buses till Katra. We baoreded one and it took about 2 hours till Karta. In katra we were lucky to find not a long queue at entry gates. We started the trek in the evening. All through the way devotees were coming and going singing bhajans n religious songs. We were already very tired when we reached ardhkwari. It has a cave which is awesome n scary. Don't miss the cave at all. It has a waiting of 6 hours so We decided to go into it while returning. We had some good n started again. We reached midnight at bhawan and were dog tired. But as We had good darshan the fatigued was lost. We spent few hours there and started down. We were again Lucky as at ardhkwari we did not have to wait at all and it was just our turn to enter the cave. It was an amazing lifetime experinence. But I would prefer not walking so much in future.
378,One of the most divine places in earth,very nice pace to visit i am very delightful to visit this place I visited this place twice like to visit again
379,Trek to Vaishnavdevi,"This is a very holiest place of Mata in India. This temple was situated in Trikuta parvat. I have visited this temple on 27.6.17 with my friends. After reaching Banganga we have cover 14-15kms by walking. there is many way to reach temple not just walk, you can borrow pony, palki, horses, helicopters."
380,My first visit to Maa Vaishno Devi,"Hi,It is remarkable to experience the wonderful arrangement made by Shrine Board for Mata Darshan. Very clean , no hassles, every thing in a chain manner , time savvy , safe and comfortable ,and a lot more facilities , no grabbing , Very low cost , and comfortable for all age group , these are some of the features of Vaishno Devi Mandir Yatra .  Alot of improvement after my earlier visit around 10 years back....thanks to the Board...."
381,Needs no review!,It is all blessings of Maa Vaishno that I am frequent visitor to this Bhawan. Great peace of mind experienced.
382,Visit,"28 April 2018Started the journey at about 6 am.  Decided to take a PITHOO to carry the luggage, They are available for about Rs 500. Useful since most have a bag with clothesInitially one comes across a lot of shops for the first 2 kms. Most food, cold drinks, memorables etc. It is worth having a cold drink in the summer and carrying one for further use. Later on the shops thin out and it appears like a real trek. Palkies are about Rs 5,000, ponies about Rs 1,000/-. Real rate is always slightly higher than official rate. At times the climb is steep, so the elderly should consider either a pony or palki. All along the way bhajans play on loudspeakers which makes the atmosphere very pleasant. There are toilets along the way which are ok for village folk, but city folk may find them a bit uncomfortable, as they are not very clean. I am suggesting to the Shrine Board to add high paid toilets. Devotees include from villagers to high end metro residents, so the systems in place should be there to cater to all needs. After travelling about 6 kms one comes to Ardhkuwari, a major junction. We skipped seeing the temple there since we were in a rush to get to the Bhawan. As senior citizens we managed to get the Battery Car after some shouting at the person who did not appear very clean in ticket distribution. Officially the battery car is only for senior citizens and handicapped. Journey by Battery car from Ardhkuwari to Bhawan is very smooth along the very nicely tiled path and the car takes about 20 minutes. It drops you at the Police Check post from where you have to trek with your luggage. We were lucky to get a room booking and checkin was easy. Lunch and Dinner are included in the room. Afternoon we rested and at 6.30 pm got into the queue for Atka Aarti. This is a 1.45 hour Arti which starts at 7.15 pm (evening session) which includes Devi Kawach, Strotras, Saraswati Vandana and Strotram etc. There after there is a incident told by the Main pandit and after that 4 ""Mata ki Bhaint"" lyrics sung very beautifully with tabla and harmonium. Thereafter there is the usual Aarti followed by the Cave puja by the main pundit. The programme ends at 9.00 pm.  This takes place in the Atka arti hall which has the entrance to the cave.  Night was dinner and rest and next day morning the down journey to Ban Ganga In summary this was the most heavenly experience ever, and after one visit one gets determined to go there again and again, not being deterred by the crowd or the climb."
383,great Darshaan,Entire experience from Katra to Bhawan was speechless. Well maintained track for walk. People working 24√ó7 to keep clear. Darshan was very good. Helicopter experience was awesome.
384,Jai mata di,"The Darshan and final abode of goddess is beautiful rest a lot of construction happening and overall hygiene has gone for a toss. Surprisingly the walking route to the shrine is clean, well made and very safe. Horses route is different n steeper."
385,Comfort all the way!,I visited Vaishno Devi last month with my parents.It was truly a blissful journey. We walked all the way upto top from Banganga.There are shops for refreshments like cold drinks coffee and food every 200-400 metres.We  started journey in the evening and took around 5 hrs to reach to the top around 12.30 am .The temple complex is very huge. We took bath there at the temple complex in the night and did the darshan . As it was a non peak month there was less crowd and we could actually sit inside the temple for around 5 minutes.Overall it was an excellent journey.
386,Mata Vaishno Devi 2 day visit Dec'17- Jai Mata Di,"A lot had changed since the shows they telecasted on National Television. The climb of 5 kilometer till Awathkari is steep. After that a more paved and much less steeper road has been carved for battery operated Rickshaw.The road is now fully covered sheds for protection against sun, rain and rolling stones. And the sides are caged with wires to prevent  accidents. Every kilometer has a eatry and  every half a kilometer has soda shops and toilets.There is horses and pithu r available to help people with the climb. The view keeps changing as the climb continues only to make you stronger in Faith."
387,Maa Vaishno Devi Yatra,"Jai Mata Dii !!! This was my first and long pending trip to Maa Vaishno Devi. I travelled along with my parents on 19-Dec-2017. The trip was planned suddenly hence couldn't plan it properly but overall trip was good and completely satisfactory.Day 1- We landed in Katra on 18-Dec evening 7:30 and directly reached hotel, we chose Atrium hotel which is near railway station & bus stand. We rested for the day to have an early start of next day.Day 2- At 6:30 Post light breakfast we left for Banganga empty handed - the starting point of the trek. As we got out of the car a lot of hawkers surrounded us for pony, prithu, palki etc. somehow we managed to escape and reached the 1st entarance checkpost. Our journey started from here.Weather was clear & sunny with 15 Degree Celsius but with cold wind and we were all packed with woolens so we were all fine. Here we decided to hire Pony for elderly parents I chose to walk with them. Pony took 700 each from Banganga to Bhavan (holy shrine).We started at sharp 7:30 from Banganga and it took 3 hours for my parents to reach straight to Bhavan (with small breaks in between). The ponies didn't stop at Adhkuwari. However, I walked entire route alone without many breaks with my usual pace and reached Adhkuwari at 9:15. This is supposed to be 6 KMs from Banganga and was the steepest path to walk. Based on the reviews on internet I took entry parchi to Adhkuwari gufa and usually it takes 2-3 hrs after that for your turn so I left for bhavan assuming my turn would come once I am back from BHAVAN. There are many food stalls, water, tea / coffee shops throughout the trek, so better not to carry anything along and go empty handed. I took himkoti route from Adhkuwari to bhavan which is around 6 KM. This route is much eaisier and mostly flat.Since December is considered to be less crowded and on week day it was even more silent so nobody was checking Yatra Parchi (I had an Online printout). Finally I reached Bhavan at 11:00 AM and met my parents there waiting for me.From this junction of Bhavan there is a straight walk of 2 KM with many checkpoints in between. We kept all our belongings like shoes, food stuff etc. In the locker (locker no. 2) and entered the queue. The floor was very cold and unbearable but somehow the blessings of Mata gave us strength to beat the cold. We saw people having holy bath with cold water before entering the queue.Finally, the much awaited moment arrived and we entered the holy cave within 5 mins of entering the queue. We had darshan of mata peacefully with pujari explaining all the details 'Jai Mata Di' the moment we waited for life was here and we were so fortunate to witness with peace without much hassle. Then we left for Bhairon Baba at 12:30 with pony rides as this 2 KM journey is too steep and since we had the flight next day so wanted to be back early. We reached bhairon baba in 30 mins and did darshan in 10 mins and again back to Adhkuwari at 3:30 with stops for photography and food.We wanted to visit Adhkuwari gufa but by the time we reached our group number was already passed and the temple was about to close for pujan from 4:30 ro 7:40 and our turn would come after 9 PM. we could have stayed but due to next day return we had no other option but to leave. I would suggest people to visit Adhkuwari first and then Bhawan and bhairon baba in sequence as during this time of year the crowd is less and there are fair chances of having quick darshan.We walked slowley with parents downwards to Banganga around 4:30 and  reached around 7:30 with plenty of stops and refreshment. overall the arrangements were fantastic we have dispensaries every 2 km and a lot of medical shops. The entire trek is so clean and well built that you will not have any issues.Finally the much awaited trip ended with full satisfaction and a pledge to return soon whenever mata ji calls us back. JAI MATA DII"
388,Religious Beauty ,"Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board has done great development to facilitate pilgrims, no doubt the most professionally managed temple complex in India"
389,Pilgramge to Trikuta Hills,If you are in Jammu keep a day spare to visit the temple of Mata Vaishnodeviji . Its a Trip to remember for lifetime. I had superb journey and amazing darshan of the temple. Memorable Trip
390,Religious Temple,"Visited in August with friends. Journey begin from Katra. One can easily take prepaid taxi, bus from Jammu tavi railway station to reach here. Ride will take 50 mins to 1 hour depends on traffic. One can also reach by train from Jammu Tavi but it take minimum 2 hours to reach Katra. One must take yatra parchi free of cost from katra bus stand before beginning journey. Also you can take yatra parchi online from vaishno devi  shrine board site. Whole area till bhawan is maintained by vaishno devi shrine board. They have set up lot of self service restaurant along the way which provide food at reasonable cost. You can walk on foot, take pony ride or palki ride to bhawan. Please note - try to start your yatra early morning so that you can get pony at cheaper rate. Do bargain here a lot as they charge you a bomb. One having small chikd can take pitthu who can carry child and bags for you. Keep water bottle with you as the journey is long. When we reach half a way - Ardhkumari, we found long queue at Ardhkumari temple. We took token for temple and continue our journey. There are two seperate ways from Ardhkumari. If you are on foot, please take ""hatnikund"" way as it is quite simple, more develop, less steep and comfortable. Beware of monkey on the way. Please note no eatable, mobile, leather item, bag, shoes allowed inside main temple. You can buy prasad from shop from Shrine Board. We had great darshan after standing in Queue for 3 hours. There is place of stay near main bhavan where you can relax, stay if you wish to stay longer here. Also there is bhairav temple more 2km above main temple which is must visit. For climbing down one can prefer to take stairs at it is much faster."
391,JAI MATA DI,Vaishno devi temple is one of the most beautiful and attractive place in india. this is a religious place as well as full of adventures. there is no words to explain the beauty and adventure of this place.
392,Maa da DXwara,Journey was long of about 6 hours from bottom of hill to top and 3 hours reverse with just 2 hours gap but scenic beauty makes your journey pleasent. All are advised to go in new path towards top and return in old path to have less painful journey. Old people are advised to go by horses but young people with group of friends enjoy the tour a lot. Helicofter is also available at a decent cost but subject to climatic conditions.
393,worth of walk,Amazing Darshan. Staff is good and all things are very well organized. All should visit for Vaishno Devi Darshan.
394,Awesome,"The trip was by 2014. climate was Chilly, the trek took 6 hrs. Many Bhawan Food Stalls are there on the way, After darshan of Mata Rani, the feel was awesome, the whole journey pain gone. Well organised and maintained.."
395,Maa da sthan,"Most popular goddess around world and within India used to visit this famous temple. All facilities and services are good, but this lacks the proper implementation part, which is a major gap."
396,Vaishno Devi Trip,Words would always be less to describe the abode of gods and almighty Mata Rani who in her natural form gives darshans.Being an avid traveller and devotee would love to be a monthly pilgrim and devote my time along with the almighty
397,Jai mata di! Government should focus more on cleanliness here.,"I have had the fortune of visiting the Trikuta Hills multiple times... This is blissful journey whether you do it for Hiking or religious fervour. 13 km trek is exhilarating, both for mind and body.Must visit"
398,Blessed,"A treat to our soul and a paradise to visit. The  24 km walk to Bhawan and back was reassurance to myself of the power of the Almighty. I have been visiting this place almost every year in past few years and have seen it gradually developing in terms of better walkway roads, helicopter rides and medical amenities and battery operated vehicles for those who cannot walk all the way upAnd back. The latest installation of music system through out the way up with religious music adds the flavor to the holy atmosphere."
399,Divine and adventurous!,I visit Vaishno Devi at-least every year twice or once in life & experience something new every year & this is the place where you never think to visit or not I loved the Place & Temple & Caves !!!
400,Jai Mata Di,"Have always been a great trip. Vashno Devi trip is a mix of trekking, adventure, religious, spiritual and many other experiences."
401,Most awesome experience one have here,this is one of my best and close to heart place which i love to visit. Now the Trains reach directly to Katra due to amazing engineering which created the bridges to reach us here. it is one of the most Holiest and sacred place to visit by Everyone. the real power of Mata Rani can be felt and i love again & again to visit to seek the divine blessing. Arrangements are good and keeps improving by every visit.!!........Jai Mata DI......!!
402,Awesome,"A beautiful mesmerising Vaisho Devi's temple. It takes around 5-6 hours walk from Katra base to Vaisho Devi's temple. Best is to take bath and start as early as 3 am. So that by the time you reach you can attend morning aarti and then you have time to visit Bhairavnath Temple.If you cant walk then there are options like pony ride,helicopter ride,etc.There are enough outlets for dinning so staying and relaxing will not be a struggle."
403,Excellent and well maintained holy place,This is a holy Hindu temple of Maa VAISNO DEVI situated in state of Jammu. This is around 51 km from jammu airport and tracking of 12 km from katra. Helicopter service is also available but you have to pre book it.
404,Best holy place,"Visited last week with family comprising of three generations.the helicopter view of valley, katra railway station and cemented roads is breathtaking. and it takes very less time (journey time is 4min) but waiting time at katra helipad is more than an hour. booking is done exactly two months ago.Distance to Vaishno Devi Bhawan from Sanjhichat is 3Km downhill and very comfortable walk. please note not to carry leather purses, mobiles, belts and accesorries etc with you as queue for submitting the goods in locker /cloak room is greater than queue for darshan of mata rani.Do visit Bhairo baba temple which is 4km uphill of Vaishno devi bhawan but ensure that you reach there well before 7pm to avoid being in standstill queue for more than an hour.Jai Mata Di!"
405,I will Walk by Faith Even if I can't See,"really a place worthy to be visit . Mata Vaishno devi Shrine board have done a lot of work for providing different facilities to the tourists . you can find food , cold drinks and  coffee and ice cream etc on the way of journey to the temple . My advise is to wear full shoes ( Sports shoes) if you are comfortable . And if you are not acquainted with the steps plz dont use the steps for reaching the temple ."
406,awesome,"It is a overnight journey from Delhi by train to Katra, where main temple is located at a walking distance of approx. 12km. Helicopter and auto are present for commute the way from down to temple. The famous temple of Bhairo Baba is present 2 km away upward side from Mata temple and is believed that one must Darshan after Mata Vaihsno Devi visit for completion the journey."
407,religious shrine in karta,Maa Vaishno devi resides in the hill top of Katra(near Jammu). It is such a divine place that you feel connected to the place and would definitely like to return.
408,jai mata di,Jai Mata Di.Vaishno Devi Mandir is one of the most powerful and most famous pilgrimage in India. The walking / hiking journey of 14 odd Kms gives you so much power that you dont feel any tiredness.The scenery is beautiful. The view of mountains is awesome.Lastly the Darshana of Vaishno Mata is something which I cant describe in words.It is just divine.
409,Totally worth the hassel,Spontaneous plan and I visited with my family after 16 years.. same divine experience.. only missing thing was peoples greeting each other Jai Mata Di.. 16 years back when I was there we need to greet every one who is passing by you.. not its very quite everyone is with phone and earphones.
410,Divine ,Jai mata di we have going with family the climate is soo good and i will stay in hotel name the grand sharan katra the hotel is soo good and so beatifull neat and clean service is soo good its a amazeable trip to maa vaishno devi
411,Vaishno Devi,"Goddess resides here in a shrine. The real travel starts from katra. The three Matas(goddesses) are residing in the shrine. Climbing a steep mountain makes it more thrilling. But if you can not walk you can hire a horse or a palanquin. The other way is to book a helicopter. Then you have to walk a normal path of 3kms. But once you reach there, the climb is worth. The beautiful view of mountains. Food is available there so need not to worry about that."
412,Jai Mata di !!!,"IT was 7 in the evening when I decided to visit the holy shrine. I boarded a local bus and reached the railway station, was lucky to connect to the bus to Katra and reached there by 10. rushed to the registration counter for the free ticket to Darshan and moved to BanGanga. After the security check I continued my walk up to the shrine and managed to reach abode by 2.30 am. After keeping my belongings and electronics at the counter had fantastic Darshan of Mata Di and descended back to katra by 730 am.  IT was a unforgettable trip indeed."
413,The temple of the Divine Mother!!,"To visit this place you need to choose correct time as weather plays crucial role during your yatra, in may it's bit hot,so you can reach here at noon/evening and start your yatra to bhavan(where mata ji's pindis are situated),bhavan is approx 14 kms from katra where one need to get their yatra parchi and then can start journey from pushpanjali. If you are going there with family &opt route by walk then you can either book your hotel stay at katra or bhavan (shrine board ) ,you can complete your entire yatra in 12-20 hours ,depends on rush . Bhairo is temple one should go after devi darshan which is steep climb from bhavan and may take another 2 hours...Vaishno devi shrine board management is poor as there was rainy day and several power cut on particular day leads to inconvenience to yatris.as path to bhavan was black out. Another alternate way is about to open in couple of days where you may get e-vehicle for transport but I am not certain about details. Pony and palki people charging almost double from what it is rated on shrine board site. There are several areas of improvement including making yatris aware of locker room what not to carry in temple and weather shift management support."
414,In search of some spiritual bliss!!,"The temple is one of the Shakthi Peethas and a sacred place which is 14KM fm Katra... One hs to get registered their names in Registration centre at Katra before visiting the temple.. One can trek, horse ride or use Helicopter facility to reach the temple at top.. Helicopter cn be booked online or in the counter at Katra near Registration Centre.. Recent fare fr 1 side Helicopter ride is Rs.1077 & fr Horse ride is Rs.700.."
415,Must visit this place once in a lifetime,A must visit with parents and young children. My parents completed a dhaam yatra whereas my children enjoyed the sight and tracking a lot. Tour completeled with a great pleasure and we visited the ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Å ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§¶‡§∞‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ and got a really peace of mind. All must go with winter ready and have two to three days time.
416,Jai Mata Di,"Vaishno Devi Temple comprises three important temples - Charan Paduka temple, Garv Gufa and Mata's Bhawan. The temple is situated at a certain altitude of Trikuta hill. The devotees need to start the 12 kilometres long trek from the foot of Trikuta hill. First temple which comes enrpute is the Charan Paduka, then after we cover a trek of 6.5 Garv gufa shows up and after we treak 12 kilometres Mata's Bhawan comes. Bhairon temple is around 1.5 kilometres from Mata's Bhawan.  The place is very well maintained. Security is very tight and there is proper organisation of devotees in queue. It was a bliss to get darshan of Mata's Pindi."
417,Walking is 12 kms up steep .. Take horse till Ardhkuwari and then take a battery car (only b4 8 am) to base of shrine..,this is a hindu devotional place. mata vaishno devi temple is open 24x7 for the devotees per day only 50000 people can get darshan. you can walk the hill or chose to take a pony or palki or go by helicopter.
418,Jai Mata Di,This is wonderful place and no words can describe it. I am regular visiter of this place from many many years and i get ultimate peace and all your wishes get fulfilled here.
419,Jai Mata Di !!!,The best time to visit Vaishno Devi ki Feb March as the number of devotees is very less. The facilities by shrine board is very good and the management is very good. Always choose the new way from ardhkuwari as its very easy. Aarti hours are from 6-8.30 so plan your journey accordingly. Jai Mata Di.
420,Strenuous but Divine walk to the Shrine,This place has changed a lot since i visited almost after a very long time.Well the thought of getting darshan of Vaishno Mata make a person so happy and filled with joy that any adverse moment will not be able to divert his/her mind.You should either plan a early morning or evening time if you wish to go walking the walking time takes from 3 to 6 hours or depends on your fitness age.you can take pony rides upto temple if you are not able to walk and also there is a palki service available for aged and senior citizens.Apart from this you can also avail Helicopter service which you will have to book in advance almost 2-3 months prior to your travel date if going in a peak season and in off season it should not be a problem.But it would be a wonderful experience if you can walk upto the temple.Meal/Snacks/Refreshment everything is availabe on the way.It was a divine experience.
421,One Day Trip,"if you are nature lover you will love to visit MAA VAISHNO DEVI for more then one reason. its not only holy place but 18KM trekking make it more interesting journey. but now a days ropeway work is going on and i dont liked it all, its going to destroy nature."
422,Beautiful shrine,"It's a short stay in mandir for a weak and I enjoyed a darshan very good and it's a historical place to Hindus in India, and it has good infrastructure providing all kinds Needs to devotees and must visit every Hindu."
423,Shri Mata Vaishno Devi,It is worth place to go for holy darshan we will achieve whatever we want in our life .There are helicopter services too.Battery car is available  from Adhkuwari for senior citizens
424,Mata ka Durbar,Very popular pilgrimage. People come from far off places to visit. One has to walk around 22 kms on both the sides but people don't mind it. Many go by ponies. Now there are battery operated vehicles as wellThanks  Best regards Lovely Rasmi
425,Divine!,Mata Vaishno devi is a dream for every Hindu. Please visit this holy place. try to book helicopter 1 month in advance to avoid last minute disappointment and pain to your whole body for another month.
426,Comparatively peaceful darshan at Mata Vaishno Devi,"This is very very famous holy place. This is maa vaishno devi temple. This temple is about 13km from katra. You can visit this temple through walk, horse or through battery tempto from adh kumari. You can also visit through helicopter."
427,Holy Place of Hindus,The journey had challenges as parents and small kids were there but we managed it by using Pithu to carry kid. Travelling on horse is bit difficult.
428,Mata Ke Darbaar me,"Religious and pious place. Best time to walk uphill 11pm onwards and reach the top by 6am morning. Yatri facilities well maintained and services like pony, palki and helicopter. Helicopter ticketing and allotment could be more professionally organized."
429,A place with soul.....,jai mata di we are blessed to have visited this hotel and would be coming here in future for the darshan.
430,For Devotees And Climbers,"""‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§¶‡•Ä""I am #blessed to visit Mata Vaishno devi, year on year, since last 25 years.Shree Mata Vaishno Devi is one of the holiest pilgrimages.The Holy Cave at an altitude of 5200ft attracts lakhs of devotees every year. Darshans are in the shape of three natural ""Pindies"".The Yatris have to undertake a mountain trek of nearly 12kms from the base camp at Katra to Banganga, Adhkuwari/Indraprastha, Sanjhichat/Himkoti to Bhawan.Darshans are open round the clock 365*7.Pony/Horse, Porter(‡§™‡§ø‡§ü‡•ç‡§†‡•Ç) and Palanquin(‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡§ï‡•Ä) services are available round the clock to facilitate Yatris.Battery Vehicle are available between Indraprastha to Bhawan for elderly, sick and handicap at fixed intervals only during the day.Helicopter services are available between Katra to Sanjhichat, at prior online booking, subject to weather conditions, only during the day.Have a #blessed Journey."
431,Mata rani temple,A no hassle trip whichwas much pleasant. All services managed by Shrine board spectacularly well. Jai Mata Di !
432,DIVINE..,"Jai Mata Di..!! We recently visited the temple and so its the right time to jot down details of the wonderful experience that we had and how to reach the temple. Review would be  useful for those who would use helicopter to reach the temple.Helicopter bookings should only be done from the official website maavaishnodevi.org The bookings are luck dependent so you should keep trying on a daily basis. Once your booking is done, you need to make a yatra parchi which is also generated free of charge from the website. This yatra parchi is also issued at the helipad but its best that you carry your own. You may book same day return since VIP passes are issued to those using the helicopter service.Once you are at Katra, you need to reach the helipad. Helicopters operate depending on weather conditions. The helicopter ride takes about 5-6 minutes. Once you are at the hill top, you have not reached the temple..Yes... you still have to walk for about 2-3 Kms ( A good 40 minutes walk for a fit person)  So if there are elderly travellers with you,  you may have to consider a ride on pony or palkhi. Palkhi charges are around 1400 ( negotiations may be done) They will take you from the helipad to the temple. One important thing - These people would end the journey earlier where most of the palkhis are stationed. But that is not the gate that you have to enter. At the helipad they would issue you VIP passes and allocate a gate number. To reach this gate you need another pass that these people are aware of. This is obtained from one of the offices in the market where all these palkhis are stationed. Pass is issued within 2-3 minutes. Unless you insist, they would not take you to the temple gate (VIP gate) There are lockers where you may deposit your hand baggage. You may ask the palkhi persons who would be ready to help you in all respects.Once at the VIP gate, you would bypass most of the queue and directly join the short queue near the temple. Ple bear in mind that you would still need to climb about 30-40 steps to reach the main temple. Once in the Mata darbaar the darshans are divine. Though you may not be allowed to stay for long but all your efforts would be worth.Imp points - 1) From helipad to temple the route gets bifurcated in the middle. If you can climb down steps, you can cut short the journey by atleast 1 KM, else you may continue on the main road from helipad to  temple. (The bifurcation is at Panchi point - pls check as I cant remember )2) Try not to carry any eatables in hand as at some point there are monkeys. They wont harm you but may snatch away the food you are carrying.3) Medical facilities are avble enroute ( see photo for details )4) Strictly no photography inside the Temple 5) Your PREPAID PHONES (pay as you go phones) wont work in Jammu and Kashmir state. So better to use a post paid connection6) VERY IMPORTANT - Buy offerings at Katra city shops. Donot buy from the shop that is located close to helipad. He will rip your pocket off in the name of Mata!7) Carry your credit or debit card through which you booked your heli ticket. they would check it at the helipad.8) Refreshments are avble at the helipad.9) If you are not carrying a cell phone, pay phone facilities are avble at the helipad.Overall the trip was a wonderful experience. Mata's darshans were divine..JAI MATA DI..!!"
433,An amazing temple,"Most spiritual place to be there.Just one small note when pilgrims are standing for mata dharshan,management should put some carpet in that road.It's very painful in winter to stand in barefoot without carpet.Excellent scenic beauty with motivation factor.Must go for every indian"
434,Jai mata di,I have been visiting the holy shrine for last so many years...but was really disappointed to see the state of affairs this time. Something has to be done to manage the number of people visiting...it has become overcrowded and the facilities are not able to sustain the pressure
435,Vijay Kaul,"There are three main holy shrines to visit in this 13.5 kilometer long Yatra which is uphill. The Garvjun gufa, Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan and Bhairo Mandir. We travelled from Delhi to Katra via the Udhaampur Express. Collected the Yatra Parchi on the Railway station and took an auto to the foot of Trikuta hill.  It was about a kilometer away. Started climbing uphill and our first halt was after 6.5 kilometers at Garvjun gufa. We collected the parchi for the darshan of the gufa and then went to the hotel there to freshen up. The garvjun darshan turn takes time. After about 4 hours our turn came in the evening time. Completed the darshan of Garvjun gufa and started the walk uphill to Vaishno Devi bhawan. It was another 5-6 kilometers uphill. Reached there before midnight. Had a fulfilling darshan. Then started for Bhairav Mandir. It was a nice experience. Retain the yatra parchi through out the period. U can be asked for it anytime anywhere."
436,Mata rani temple ,"This is very famous holy religious place.   This is maa vaishno devi temple. This temple is about 13km from katra. You can visit this temple through walk, pithu, ponny and by or through battery vans from adh kumari. You can also visit through helicopter..we took ponny from Katra to Ardkuwari Nd then we went by walk.It took 2 hours to reached Bhawan.we attended evening Arti nd it was heavenly experience.we went to Bhairav Baba also by Tram.Its so convenient now.it took one hour to go n come back to Bhawan. The shrine board has made excellent facilities for the devotees.Jai Mata Di"
437,"""Jai Mata Di"" A beautiful visit",Vaishno Devi Mandir is symbolic of power. It is known that if you visit the Mandir with a true heart all your desires are fulfilled.
438,To express and reassure your faith,"We visit Vaishno Devi temple nearly every year, the least crowd here is on Diwali day and during Shraadhs, in week days the least crowd is on wednesdays and thursdays as its mid of the week and no nearby cities have there weekly offs on these 2 days, u must get a parchi or token from the shrine board office before starting the journey as u will require it when u reach bhawan on the commencement of ur journey, there are ponies and palkis available for poeple who can not walk all the way, helicopter is also available but only on prior booking, inside the main gufa there is darshan of PINDIS.on the way there are Charan paduka and Ardhkawari temple, Keep chanting Jai Mata Di and hear it resonate!!!"
439,Inspiring place,"Spiritual and soulful temple for which you have to climb 14kms.If you think you will be tired climbing 14 km don't think that because as you reach the temple you start feeling so good, positive and forget all your tiredness. You can climb by riding on a mule(khachar) or by helicopter, otherwise, the pathway is nicely built so no problem climbing by foot.The view you get on the way is just amazing."
440,nice and cool pilgrim place,"There is nothing better than going to Vaishnodevi for darshan as experienced in the past. However, my experience yesterday can only make me rate is as a very bad experience. My grievance is against the shrine board management and people in particular. The Shrine board needs to make its administration better. During non peak times darshan is fine but during peak time CRPF people do nothing except showing attitude. Even volunteers talk as if they are doing us a favour. They decide what is right when they are just selective in their roles. And of course how to behave with a lady is what CRPF needs to learn. They push a woman when she reaches the pind even before a second passes. We understand there is rush but they do not have any right to manhandle and push. They need to be trained how to differentiate between terrorists and civilians. We are not terrorists whom they should behave so badly with. They cannot control the millions of people who get inside the queue without standing in the queue and harass people who follow rules. They should look at better ways for handling large crowds ( which is present in other temples like say Tirupati). One would expect such a low behaviour from a common volunteer but not from CRPF. After pushing when I was going down I was about to skip a step and he says I should have seen where I am going as if he would have apologised or done anything if I would have been hurt. He has the audacity of saying that I have should have watched my step. Also till Adhkuwari, the roads have been made a mess full of shops and only horses everywhere that people can't walk. The restaurant owners, people all seem to lack the basic courtesies. All in all would not advise anyone to go at least in peak season or be prepared for mess and apparently people are happy to adjust because they say Mata Rani ke darshan Karne aaye hain . So what I understood we should be prepared to 10s of thousands to go inside queues without queuing up and CRPF people to say and do whatever they like."
441,jor se bolo jai mata di,It is holy temple where people come here for pray god durga. At this place we feel piece and enjoy comfortable. You cannot  worries about food .In between yatr so many luger are available by shine board
442,Peaceful,"Holy Cave of mata Vaishnodevi Situated in Trikut Parvat.Base Town for Holy cave is katra, which is now Conneted through Railwayline.Holy place and major pilgrimage in India you can Reach to temple through Treck, on Horses, pony or by helicopter. From Holy cave of mata Vaishnodevi devotee can also take darshan of Bhairavnathji which is known as protector of vally. Ardhakuvari temple is also in route of mata vaishnodevi shrine"
443,Divine visit,"Mata Vaishno Devi is one of thePious Holy Caves in the World. You must visit once there in a life time with your Family for getting blessings of Mata Rani. Various facilities are available like the Battery Running Cars, horses and Palkis for all devotees. Water facilities and Toilets are available free of cost for all.   Jai Mata Di"
444,Tourist place,we walked to the shrine the only is that they should have tracks for horse as people using horse to go to shrine was not good experience
445,Exhausting but rewarding trip,"Visited there on 08-11-2018, day after diapvali. Crowd was very less, so darshan was great. Booked seats in helicopter to and from Katra - Sanjichat - Katra. This booking was done 60 days before. Else Helicopter booking may not be available. Booking opens 60 days before. Price for ticket is around 1077/- Per person. From Sanjichat , walked 3-4 kms to Bhawan for darshan. Both ways helicopter booking will get VIP entrance pass into the Bhavan for Darshan. It was an excellent Darshan. Then went uphill to Bhairon Nath Temple, around 3-4 Kms, Took approx 45 minutes on foot. Spectacular scene, natural beauty, peaceful and calm. The Temp was 10-12 'C and wind blowing. Horse, Palki, Pitthu is available there. Bargain before hiring. Food is available at reasonable price. A must visit, once in life time.Note. Currently Cable Car From Bhawan to Bhairab Nath Mandir has started. Please check the charges."
446,A long ride to divine blessings,"We have recently visited Vaishnav Devi , Karra Jammu.If you are fit and planning to go 14 kms by walking then make sure your journey starts early morning as it may take 5 to 6 hours depends on the conditions and your speed.There are some other option too like horses or helicopters.Pl make very sure if you riding on horses, then ask care taker to always be with you as sometime they walk behind the horses which is very dangerous at those hilly areas.Another option is helicopter that you will need to book in advance as it always show full.If you have booked helicopter for round trip then you will get VIP pass for darshan so you will bypassing all crowded queues. Even for one way booking you will get priority pass which help to by pass long queues.Best month to visit there is March , April May, September October.Please try not to go at festival time specially 1 to 5 January every new year .

Jai Mata Di..."
447,Vaishnav devi,It was the fourth time I went to Vaishno Devi and trust me every time my excitement level rises up. I just love to roam in mountains. You will enjoy each and every step moving towards the temple. Trust me this will add a never forgetting life experience to you travel book.
448,Divine in the hills,"Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine is a very popular pilgrimage for hundreds of thousands of pilgrims. Over the last 30 odd years that I have been visiting this shrine, I can see tremendous improvements made by the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board in every aspect related to yatris, and that is commendable indeed.First off, one has to get a Yatra Slip from Katra. Every visitor has to go to the counter, because a computerised photograph is taken, and a slip issued individually. So, one member of a family cannot get a slip for the rest of the family. This slip is issued at the Niharika Complex near the Bus Stand.The yatra starts at the Banganga Gate: hotels normally provide transport to their guests up to this gate. There are numerous check-posts along the route where the traveller is frisked and bags inspected. On return, the yatri has to call the hotel and they send a car for a pick up.Most of the route is now covered for protection against rain and sun, it is really very helpful. The path is paved and quite broad.One can walk or take a pony, or take a helicopter, or sit in a chair and be carried by a crew of four. The ponies and chairs go up to Ardh Kawari, the helicopter goes up to Sanjhi Chat. From just short of Ardh Kawari, there are battery operated vans all the way to the shrine, or Bhawan as it is called. For children, there are prams available on hire and one can also hire a porter to push the pram for you.All rates are fixed and there are prepaid counters along the route, so if one starts out walking and then changes his mind, it is possible to pre-pay for a pony or a chair; however, the horse or the chair carrier has to be with you, because their licence numbers are also entered into the receipt.There are numerous food stalls along the route and rates quite reasonable, as they are controlled. For example, I had a cup of Nescafe Coffee for Rs.20; at an airport I would have to pay at least 60 or more.Battery operated cars seat 7 and are available only for those aged 55 or more; an ID is required to buy a ticket; one person is given a maximum of two tickets. However, I did see several folks much younger taking a ride. The process here needs improvement. The ticket also has your car number, written by hand, and you can only ride in your car. When we bought the ticket at Bhavan, the two of us were allotted car nos. 13 and 14. Other cars were waiting, but they did not have any passengers allotted to them; then more cars arrived, and again, there were no passengers allotted to them. So these cars just drove in with passengers from Ardh Kawari and waited; and there were about 30 ‚Äì 40 of us with tickets with no cars to ride. Our wait was at least half an hour. There needs to be some form of communication between the ticket counter and the car stand to iron out this problem.A kilometre or so before one reaches the Bhavan, one is given a group number on the yatri slip that was issued at Niharika: this is to ensure that yatris are gathered in groups to visit the shrine.Before one reaches the Bhavan, there are two shops selling Prasad or bhent. There are  also two locker stores (free of cost) to store your baggage, mobile, belts and purses. The first locker is preferable, as the second one is located about 50 ‚Äì 60 steps down the hill and one is so tired that the prospect of going down and coming up again is rather daunting.There are bathing ghats for men and women who wish to bathe and change before Darshan.One gets very little time before Vaishno Devi as there is quite a bit of rush. But we found that one cannot place any money in front of the deity: all offerings of money are to be given at donation counters and one gets a proper receipt.All in all, the facilities for visitor have improved vastly over the years, and  I commend the Shrine Board for their efforts."
449,Memorable,"I have visited twice in last two years and will go again in coming years. The path to temple is very well maintained. Both the time I traveled at night and its completely safe. Starting from children to old people, all are chanting JayMata Di and walking all the way along. There are pony and plakis too. You can opt for those if you can't walk. Also you can opt for porter who will take you child on their back to the temple."
450,Holy Shrine,One of the famous Hindu religious Temple. It is situated about 13 kms from Katra. On the way one can find eating points and resting sheds.
451,Jai mata di,Have booked Helicopter for Maa Darshan. They give u VIP gate no 4 for quick darshan. Would advise to book horse for return trip to helipad as last 300 Mts are too steep. 3 hours would be enough for booking a return helicopter.
452,Jai Mata di,This was my 2nd visit to Vaishnodevi and first during Navratri. You cannot see this place and not come again for maata ki darshan. The place was crowded this time due to Navratri and this was expected but not something that will cause you any trouble. Had opted for a heli ride while coming down and it was amazing. a 7-8 mins ride and will cost you 1170/person one way. Worth it if you consider pony/palki fares.
453,Very nice Experience,the visit to this divine place is always a pleasant experience with a lot of efforts done by the management to continually improving the services for visitor. the visit to Vaishno Devi is all about your faith in god.
454,Jai Mata Di,"My family visited Vaishnodevi for the 1st time last week. This was an amazing experience and we were blessed by Mata. Half of my Family took battery car from Ardhkuwari and half of us trekked the entire 12 kms. Once you reach at the top, all your thakawats and tiredness will go off. Must Visit. !! JAI MATA DI !!P.S. Battery Car is very tough to get. Don't vouch or bank upon it. What you can easily get is Horses and  Pittus"
455,Pious,"Mata Vaishnodevi Shrine is about 16 Kms from Katra. One can go by foot, or by pony, or palki or even go by Helicopter. For Helicopter one has to book in advance. They do have counter on same day in the morning, but due to huge rush one should be online 60 days in advance to avod last minute disappointments."
456,Maa Vaishnoo Devi ,"Hike of approx 13 kms is not an easy task for normal people but the devotion make you strong and you manage to hike. After 3kms, I was struggling but saw people walking with infant in hand without shoes and my battery was recharged. Facilities through out are superb. New route is extraordinary and easy to climb. They have option to book helicopter and auto rickshaw also but we choose to climb on foot"
457,Vaishnodevi Temple,Only Lucky people will visit this holy shrine.. The Great Pindi Darshan.. Chants.. Scenic beauty....
458,Vaishnodevi temple,It just feels so calm & relaxing whenever I visit this temple. This was my 3rd visit to the temple in April 2018. One can go by booking helicopter or by horses or by climbing the Trikut mountain from Katra town. Overall distance from Katra is 12 Kms. The best part that I like is by going on foot to visit this temple & enjoying the holy journey & the mountains. It takes roughly 5-6 hrs to reach the temple. One can stay overnight & feel the holy abode.
459,Awesome temple ,"It is an unique experience of being there infront of Mata Vaishnodevi after a long trek of 14kms.... The trekking is very good experinece... We walked 7kms & balance in Pony ride.... The 7kms too, we walked 3kms & then took a pony for 4kms & then walked 4kms & took pony ride for balance 7kms... we started at 10PM & reached at 3AM in the morning at Bhawan (temple venue)... had darshan by 3.30AM... stayed in the hall by taking the free wollen blanket service till 6AM.... Took ahelicopter ride back to katraOver all it was a very pleasant experience..."
460,Divine,This is a temple dedicated to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi. The shrine can be reached popularly by walking 12 kms or by ponies or palkis. There is a helicopter service which has to be booked online min 30 days in advance.
461,Jai mata di,It is a most popular temple in north India. Mata Rani bless every one with her love and care. You will feel divine light deep inside you.
462,Fell Amazing,"I am regular pilgrim to this place since my birth and am fortunate enough to manage 4 to 5 visits a year. Mata Vaishno Devi Temple is situated on the holy Trikuta mountain range of the Himalayas with foothills in Katra (Jammu). One can reach Katra by train (4/5 trains from all parts of India) or by Air till Jammu and by road (45 minutes) to Katra.The trek to the sacred temple begins from ""Ban Ganga"" and ends up at Bhawan covering a total distance of 11 Km up-hill. One can travel on foot, or hire a 'pony' or a 'palvi' as per capacity. An alternate way is to take a helicopter that operates only during day and clear weather and drops you a Km away from Bhawan.If trekking, go uphill during the night to avoid heat, manage to enjoy 'Arti' at 6am and come back during the day or spend an evening and come back in night.Inside the cave, the idols are in the shape of ""imaginary natural stones"" called ""pindi""; each representing Mata Kali, Mata Vaishno & Mata Saraswati (from right to left respectively). The return journey is supposedly complete after visiting the shrine of ""Bhairon Baba"". On way back, one can also visit ""Garb Jun"" at mid way (Adhkumari).It is a belief that the place is powered with super-spirituality that one's desires can be fulfilled just by taking a glimpse of the ""Pindi""Jai Mata Di (Bow to the Deity)"
463,Must Visit shrine in Jammu(Katra),A divine destination where every Hindu who has faith in religion would like to visit. One has to cover a distance of 13 K M to reach the holy shrine.
464,JMD,"Jai Maata Di.Visited Maa Vaishnodevi mandir second time. Maa ka bulaav came after 7 years.Travel to Katra. Katra town is the base camp with lot of hotels, restaurants and huge devotee complex of the temple board. Three options for travel to Katra:A. Fly to Jammu and drive down to Katra. Plenty of taxis, state transport buses as well. Taxi takes ‚Çπ1000-1200 for one way and about 70-90 minute drive.B. Drive down to Katra from Delhi or Amritsar or other places. Road to Katra from Jammu is v good. C. Train to Katra: best option as there are a good number of trains from Delhi and other places. Overnight journey.KATRA to Bhawan- Maa Vaishnodevi temple. For all hatred, yaatra parchis are a must. One can book Yates parchi, helicopter ride, rooms in Katra and Ardhkuwari/Bhawan, Aarti tickets etc. on the temple website only.Lots of options. Helicopter. Operates between Katra and Sanchi Ghat. From Sanchi Ghat, Bhawan is about 2-3 Km. One can walk or take a horse/pony. Helicopter best option if one wants to visit only Bhawan and Bhairon and not Ardhkuwari.Walk/trek: two routes, one the newest - clean and very clean with no pony allowed. Lots of facilities. The local people say it is a longer route - 2 km or so. If ism is only Bhawan and Bhairon, best option. The other one is old route via Ardhkuwari. Very well maintained, lots of shops and massage machines on the way. Stairs too there. But, avoid stairs while going up the hill.Ardhkuwari has limited accommodation options. Book online in advance. Once u reach Ardhkuwari, u need to take a Parchi Ardhkuwari. It will take anywhere between 6-10 hours after parchi is taken to be allowed to t(e holy cave at Ardhkuwari. No online parchis are issued for Ardhkuwari. Parchi for main temple can not be used here. Very good rooms with hot water at Ardhkuwari.Pony/Horse: plenty of them available on the old route via Ardhkuwari. One can take Pony up to Ardhkuwari or Bhawan . At Bhawan, Ponies stop almos 1.25 km before the temple. One needs to walk from there.Battery Operated Vehicle. The temple board operates battery operated vehicles between 6am and 10 pm from/to Bhawan to/from Ardhkuwari. For taking the vehicle from Ardhkuwari, one has to come down about a KM (& not take the tunnel entrance walking route at Ardhkuwari). Onward to BhawanIf you have normal Yatra Parchi, proceed thru‚Äô a fe check points to 5r darshan queue. Have a great darshan and you can buy ur Bhaint for Matarani or Prasad from any of the temple counters.If you have Aarti Parchi report at Counter 8 and register. U Will be given a group Parchi. You will be made to stand in queue as per your group no,Have a great darshan. Jai Mata Di"
465,Amazing experience.,Holy Place. Helicopter ride was helpful for Sr citizens like us. Calm and quiet place for worship.we got utmost satisfaction.
466,Awesome view from the top,A very different experience of all the visit very tuff and hard Yatra but enjoying its good climate on the mountain
467,Good weather and less crowd,Used helicopter to and fro. Time in between is too tight if you want to visit Bhairo Temple also. Be sure to reach on time to Helipad as there is always huge rush and be prepared to wait for sometime to board
468,Must Visit,goddess resides here in the form of pindi but shrine board not controlling prices of horses and the rooms are very less in number so mostly the people are forced to sleep on the way to vaishnodevi
469,Awesome jatra,Maa Vaishno Devi herself gives the strength to go on for 12 kms upward . It is actually the abode of god....blissful experince.
470,Shrine board doing a good job ,"I am extremely thankful to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi ji for blessing my family with her kind Darshans.I also thank fellow Tripadvisor members for answering my queries and sharing wonderful information, which helped me in planning my trip.Bhairon Mandir ropeway service- Using this ropeway service, you can easily travel from Manokamna Bhawan to Bhairon Baba Mandir in just 3-4 minutes.- Going and coming back costs total Rs 100/- per person. This is a combined ticket for going to Bhairon baba mandir and return journey to Manokamna bhawan. - Children upto 3 years do not need to buy any ticket provided accompanying people can produce age proof the child.- Ropeway does not operate after 6:30 pm IST.- All people, irrespective of age and gender, can avail ropeway service.Helicopter Service- The service provided is excellent. You get only 3-4 minutes to appreciate the beauty of Trikuta hills, but is really a refreshing experience and enjoyable journey.- Check-in process to go from Katra to Sanjhi chhat is very time taking. You may need to spend 2-3 hours after reaching Helipad. The reason is that many people come with references of Shrine board members or CRPF/army/Helicopter agency staff. So such people get priority over other common people.-Unfortunately, some agents are still operating with nexus with operating agency. Such people book tickets at last minute and quickly go in flight, while other common people have to wait.-The people are clubbed based on their weight in a flight. So same family may be split across flights.-The staff is caring for children and elderly people.-Infants up to 2 years age travel free with elders. But children need to be weighed along-with carrying person. Also maximum 2 such infants can be accommodated per flight.-When Helicopter arrives, there is huge thrust of wind by helicopter blades. So women need to tie knots in saree or chunni, else it may get stuck in Helicopter blades.-Your online tickets will be first validated against actual debit/card used for booking. If you do not carry aadhar card or debit/credit card, you will be denied boarding.-You need to hand-over your mobiles and bags to staff before boarding.- At Sanjhi Chhat, morning check-in counters start around 7 am IST.Attka Aarti-Timings of aarti changes with time. So please check timings by watching actual LIVE aarti on ""Shraddha MH One"" channel on your TV or their website.-Morning aarti is normally conducted during (6:20 am - 8 am) IST, while evening aaarti may be conducted during (6:20 pm -8 pm ) or (7:20 pm - 9 pm) IST.-You need to obtain Group number for your family from Kalika Bhawan Room No. 8. The earlier you report, the earlier row you will get for sitting in Atka Aarti.-From 1-Apr-2019, Attka Aarti ticket has increased from Rs 1000/- to Rs 2000/- per person.-Children below 10 years age need not buy Attka Aarti ticket, but you may be asked to produce age related documents for free entry. Children, who have completed 10 years age, need to buy separate ticket.Room Booking- Elderly people are advised to book Dormitory beds in Manokamna Bhawan instead of Rooms. Because Manokamna Bhawan is near Sagar Ratna, so you need not climb any stairs from Sagar Ratna/Bhawan.- Vaishnavi Bhawan is around 80 steps of stairs upwards from Sagar Ratna.- Gaurai Bhawan is more than 300 steps of stairs upwards from Sagar Ratna.-For checking-in, there is common Reception Counter for Gauri Bhawan and Vaishnavi Bhawan. So for checking for Vaishnavi Bhawan as well, you need to go to Reception Counter ar Gauri Bhawan.- Rooms are extremely neat and clean and big.- Do not expect any hotel kind of treatment from rooms. It is for overnight stay purpose only.Important Tips1. You may go till Bhairon Baba Mandir in Shoes.2. Try to utilize Locker service instead of your booked rooms for keeping shoes, else you may need to walk a lot without shoes. This will create cracks in feet as stones are sharp edged at many places.3. Do not carry eatables in hand while walking as monkeys may come any moment and snatch things.4. You need to show debit/credit card used for all bookings. Else you will be simply denied the booking.5. Even on 18-Apr-2019, during day time, we had to wear woolen jackets at Bhawan. So you should carry warm clothes in all seasons/months at Bhawan.6. Last, but the most important thing- Please do not think that you can have Darshan of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi ji, even after booking train, Helicopter, Room/Bed At Bhawan, Attka Aarti well in advance. Because you may be forced to return even from Bhawan without Darshan, if you do not have permission from Mata. This is true as 35 years ago, when I was a child, I and my parents had to return from Bhawan without Darshan due to un-foreseen circumstances. This time also, there were a lot of hurdles in our visit. My 10-year old son got his right arm fractured just 2 weeks prior to our scheduled visit. There were also many last minute challenges. We prayed to Mata Vaishno Devi ji for allowing us to visit and bless us with her Darshans. Finally, our prayers were heard and all hurdles were started clearing one by one slowly. Also my son and both parents got strength from Shri Mata Vaishno Devi ji to travel and bare-footed walk  and we got wonderful Darshans of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi ji. So the phrase ""Only those can visit whom Mata calls"" is absolutely correct.Jai Mata Di!!!"
471,Jai mata di,"I visited Mata Vaishno Devi for the first time. It was such a spiritualy uplifting experience . We had booked helicopter but as we had travelled in July due to heavy rain the Helicopter did not run so we cancelled our ticket after 2-4 hours of wait , took an auto and reached Banganga ,the starting point of the journey. Here we had to get our lugage and Yatra Parchi scanned then bargained for horse riding and pithoo(coolie) to carry our luggage.Take the ID-Card of the Pithoo before handing over your luggage to him. You can also get doii for older people and children . You can also go by walk but the slopes are quite steep and you have to take rest at regular interval.  Good arrangement of toilets at regular interval  and 70 % of the pathway has teen shades over it so not much trouble from Sun and Rain.The Road is walkable but as horses also move on the same path you have to be alert while walking. Midway is Ardhkuari temple you can rest and have snacks at this place. The horses follow a bypass to Ardhkauri .we reached Bhawan in 3 hours . There was long queue for darshan as darshan stops between 6 to 9 for arti , After arti the queue moved fast and we could do Darshan in 1 hour.Overall a satisfing experience."
472,SOUTH Goa,"New route via tarakote to adhkunwari is longer but much less steeper than the original route. Plus, this new route has literallly no noise (because no shops & minimal tourists - so I guess that people generally don't prefer this new route) and has cleanest wash-rooms."
473,trip to vaisnodevi ,Bulawa (calling) came after 12 years and all prep done just 2 weeks before. We choose new route to walk till Ardh kunwari. Though long the incline is not steep and adequate arrangements made for sitting. It was raining crazy and there was landslide on new route between Ardh kunwari to Bhavan hence had to take Sanjhichat route which was pretty tough. Since we went on weekend it was pretty crowded specially at luggage counters. Overall darshan was nice and satisfying. The overall look of Bhavan area has completely changed in past 12 years (in terms of facilities and temples).
474,Jai Mata Di,very good city most of thing is very beatiful palce are there it is a group of temple in jammu city must visit..!
475,Jai Mata Di (The Divine Feeling),Religious place..of Hindus but no restrictions for any faiths. 14 km climb road is amazing.Serene cool environment. Its bliss to be there. Connected by Jammu airport and train till katra.
476,Jai Mata Di... ,"Jai mata diI have been visiting Vaishno devi Every year since 1993. Maybe skipped a year or 2. Every visit is awesome and unique. Not that katra railway station is there, we stay nearby station in hotels providing free pick and drop to station and banganga. Trek all the way to bhawan( although some of us have booked pony or copter from time to time). Bookings at the bhawan are usually full so we return the same day. Rest and leave for our home the next day. Food at manoranjan dhaba is the best. Stay at J K residency and jai Maa inn is nice. Enjoy!!"
477,One of the best walking journey,"it is the place of mata rani, so i really felt something different up there....but a word of caution......it is crowded and so many pilgrims are there that one needs to manage time. nothing is allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum so you need to deposit your belongings in the locker rooms where again there is a huge huge queue. Instead it is recommended that if you are travelling in groups, split up and visit the temple separately. so one group takes care of the belongings while the other pays the holy visit. It saves time."
478,Best pilgrimage Hindu temple ,"holy trip. Options for the 12km uphil journey are walking, ponny,  palki (4people carry old/disabled), helicopter. electric vehicles available from adhkumari at fix timings"
479,Shere wali Maa,"Mata vaishno Devi temple is at the top of hill situated in katra (Jammu & Kashmir) . It is believed that your wish will be fulfilled if you go there by a pure heart. Goddess Vaishno Devi showers her blessings to all. ""JAI MATA DI"""
480,Walking journey to get Vaishno Devi Mata's darshan,"Great ExperienceVisit Vaishno Devi Temple,Bhairav Dev Temple,Aardhkawari,Baanh Gangha,Shiv Khori and more"
481,Jai Vaishno Maiyya,"Chalo bulawa aaya h , mata ne Bulaya h . I got opportunity to visit this sacred place with my brother and few friends , it‚Äôs a full adventurous visit with lots of trekking , stairs climbing üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and we really enjoyed the same , place is very good , you get horse riding or helipad facility if u can‚Äôt climb so long , it‚Äôs really crowded due to its religious value and devotion . U get Darshan for 1 mins for max. Street food is good but taxi charges are too high ( they charge 300-400 Rs. even for short distance ) , never use taxi instead walk ahead. Shopping can also be done after Darshan in local shops though most of the articles are costly"
482,Boooo Boooo Shrine Board!!!!,"The Vaishno Devi Temple is on the top of a hill. There are many stories for this temple, which you can read from shrine board website. It is better to see Shrine board website before visiting Vaishno Devi. Remember to take Yatri Parchi from the website or from Katra Bus Stand before visiting here,"
483,Must visit temple in Jammu,"The place has amazing vibes.. The journey up the hill of 12 kms is quite thrilling..there are food joints up on the way till the temple so u wont have any problem climbing up.. Down the hill in Katra as well there are good hotels, shops and restaurants all within a small area.. For those who cant walk so much there is pony ride available as well.. There also is helicopter service.. The mantra of zor se bolo jai mata di is quite motivating and energising.. So, jai mata di..."
484,Best Pilgrimage,a place to visit any time. only postpaid connection are allowed in Jammu state. Visit and feel fragrance of nature
485,Jai Mata Di..!! Detailed guidance to reach Temple from Katra,"The place is spiritual and must to visit in a life. Visit without any doubt and demands, Mata will give you all you need. Best time to visit is Feb- March. Route is very difficult. But somehow every one reach at temple by any way , Walking, By horse/Pooni riding or by Palkhi. All route is fairly maintained. All the way audio system has been installed for religious music. We are lucky as old gunfa was open for darshan, But we missed Ardhkuwari Darshan.  By walking- at least need 14 to 15 hr to complete darshan . By horse/Pooni riding it's take 7 to 8 hrs. but it's also very much exhausted. Get the clear idea about fare for horse/Pooni riding. They will charge your more. In Mata Temple no need to take any thing like coconut , Flowers etc. , Dakshina put only in hundi. Mandir opens 24 X 7 . But make a purchi on time."
486,Very unorganized and mismanaged pilgrimage,when you walk 14 kilometer for the darshan.. and when you finally complete your ... you get so much satisfaction and fell blessed and feel like coming again and again..
487,Be Blessed!,Great holy  place to visit with Family you will feel the calmness and positive energy with all bhakts in good mood of prayer.
488,Jatra,"Blessed to have darshan of Maa Vaishno Devi and also witness the Aarti. Walking up and down needs to be carefully planned and need to be in good health.Enough support and food, water available along the way. Travel really light (preferably without anything in hand). Keep a walking stick handy."
489,People are not going to like this.,I visited mata ka darbar in jun.the place is very well ma ikea ntained by the shrine board. The light mata music through out the route was a Devine feeling.. however some advisories are to book beds much in advance to avoid ending up sleeping in open at bhawan. However you can hire blankets for free against refundable security deposit. You may like to book beds in the clean and well maintained dormitories. Also plan to travel at night only during this time of the month to avoid the killing heat and the rush. I travelled the while night and found it very comfortable. The awaiting at ardhakawari was rougly three days si if someone in keen to visit both tye darbar and ardhakawari then plan accordingly. Jai mata di
490,MOST POWERFUL MANDIR IN INDIA ,"I visited during Deepavali day this year and the crowd was manageable. We preferred to climb up and down by foot, though there were other options. It takes about 5-6 hours one way and we wouldn't call us good at trekking, but our faith got us the drive. Plan your visit to Bhawan to avoid the Arathi time, when the shrine would be closed (twice a day for two hours each); the wait is longer and the queue worse. Also if you are keen on visiting Ardhkwari, then you might want to get the token first, find out if the wait is going to be long, head up to Bhawan and you can come back to see if your token number is up.The facilities could be improved and more convenient and affordable transport options within the town should be arranged. But no matter what, the visit is worth all the little inconveniences once you set your eyes on the Goddess. Oh, plus the Shivlingam just outside (infact need to climb down a bit) the main shrine is a surprise to anyone. Do not miss it."
491,Pleasant trip Maa Vaishno Devi Katra,Must visit place. You can feel the difference in Mata ke Darwar.You may have different zeal at this spiritual place.Jai Mata Di
492,Cleanse Yourself with Vaishon Devi Yatra,This was my first tour with my Best Friend.  We enjoyed this tour. We reached at Darbar in 5HOURS with out any stop.
493,Very holy Place to visit. Please get your Yatra token one hour before you travel and take print if done online,"Being divine place there is a rush And we have to follow set of rules. There are many ways to reach the main temple I.e either u can walk , horse ride, Palki, Pittu,or helicopter. Electric vehicle is also available from mid way. As per your requirements and availability, select the transport medium. I will suggest to visit this place."
494,Jai Mata di,One of the holiest shrine in india. This place is neat and clean. Be aware at the time of yatra do not forgot to takle yatra slip along with you. try to avoid heavy luggage during chadhai. and if you want to stay at bhavan or adhkuwari. Make your booking online or in katra itself because at bhawan only single beds are available. Try to get arti darshan
495,Beautiful views and good facilities,The Best time to visit Vaishnodevi.Chillingweather cold breeze we started at 9pm and walked almost 16km. In 4hrs better walk while climbing so you can enjoy carry water and juice to avoid any tiredness.and while returning back come by horse ride awesome experience.it was less crowded so we spent more time during Darshana.Must go to vairobaba to make your wish complete.
496,Jai Mata Di,"1. I had take a return journey ticket by helicopter . The flight from katra was at 3.30 PM . We arrived their early and got the seats . It seems to be on a first come first serve basis so be there early .     The helicopter journey took us 5-7 mins and we were dropped at Sanghi Chat . The walk from Sanjhichat to Bhawan was 30-40 mins .     An important point of note is that as my return flight was next day morning , I did not get a priority Darshan pass.2. I got in line for Gate No 5 , they close the gates each evening for Arti and reopen later in 2-3 hours . One of us had to stand at the gate and hold our place in the line . Near Gate 5 there is a canteen where you can get something to eat .   Another issue we had was putting our stuff ( camera bag , leather purse etc ) please note that no leather items and mobile phones are allowed for Darshan. I saw people being escorted out .3. Post Darshan we had dinner and instead of spending night there , we decided to walk back to katra . Some points worth noting here .   a) At night it is difficult to get a palki for Sr citizens . I had a torrid time with people asking for twice the cost .    b) The point where you get the horses to get back to Katra is a little way up from Bhawan . It‚Äôs 300 m walk up......It‚Äôs tricky in case somebody is having trouble walking . I got stuck and had a hard time in getting folks to the point where we could get the horses.  c) Even with the horses it took us around 3 hours to get to katra . The decoration during Navratra is worth seeing . Inspite of the mad rush ....would definitely go again . Jai Mata Di."
497,Holi place to visit,As the name says param shanti is attained just by reaching there. One feels eternal peace there. The darshan was done in a disciplined way. The staff is also cooperative
498,Very famous Vaishno Devi temple,"i have visited mata's darbar number of time and still want to visit again, one really feel very close to mata and mother nature while walking on road, it's best to complete the Yatra by walk but one can take pony ride or Heli ride as per their preference, If One really want to enjoy your Yatra towards darbar than one should visit vaishno devi in winter season as there are very few people and you will get good darshan of pindies. and i must say don't use stairs you  will strain your musle would not enjoy yatra. also visit shiv khori it's not far from Katra"
499,For those going on foot! ,"Mata Vaishno Devi yatra is full of excitement to all for darshan of Mata Vaishno Devi. All the facilities are available during yatra like drinking water, toilets, restaurants etc. moreover medical facilities are also available. Chopper facilities are also available."
500,Ardhkuwari Darshan Trick: SAVE TIME !!!,It is a wonderful experience when you visit Maa Vaishno Devi Darshan.By walk or by pony ride it is very exhausting jounrey but you have energy and enthusiasm.Myself and my wife had a divine blessings from Maa.Jai Mata Di
501,Jai mata di,it is very great place to visit. since 2011 we are going every december or january there..it is amazint that you will walk 14 km and you will not feel much tired. in my city i tired after 2km but there you will feel fresh after long walk. it is mata chamatkar(miracle) jai mata di
502,Spiritually uplifting,The best part of the entire trip to vaishno Devi was the walk to top. It is a real motivation to see the huge efforts taken by fellow pilgrims
503,‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§¶‡•Ä ,"""Mata ka Mandir""...i have no courage or status to rate this. Jai Mata Di :) The truly authentic Indian culture in display, a devine place and should visit once in your life time. The nature meets the human, what else you can say...Jai Mata Di"
504,Jai Mata Di . JAI MATA DI,I was surprised by the cleanliness of this holy place. They have maintained this place very well. People are very friendly. They have helicopter service which we used. It is reasonable too. Have arrangements for overnight stay as well
505,"Trip To Vaishno Devi, JK","Jai mata di!The trust definitely improving this place day by day. In comparison to our previous visit 10 years back, the walk way has become more comfortable. There are many support systems for people to take rest or change the mode of transfer. Good foid canteens."
506,One of my ambition life full filled after a lapse of 60+ years age.,Good place for visit and good view and go to temple then feel peace and all negative thought is out of your mind.then plzzz visit Vaishno devi and Jai mata di
507,Jai Mata Di,"Wonderful, I reached on top within 3 hours and stayed back for more than five hours, The place is so serene and holy and you feel actually in the awe of Mata....you feel energy and vibrations.."
508,Vinata,"Must say one of the most well coordinated shrines visited till now,experience is divine and its luck only which takes you there ....fabulous."
509,Divine Darshan,"The temple is very beautiful and it is a must visit atleast once in a life time . New facilities are added now like the new road to the temple (less steep but more long ). Even though there are prepaid counters for palki or horse , they still charge you extra . Prepaid counters for auto at Katra also does not have prepaid rates . The rate is still what the drive says. Avoid going to the temple at peak period as the queues can be really long ."
510,Holy trip,"One of biggest pilgrimage for Indians.Though now various modes of transport like battery car ( after 6 km), helicopter , horse but i would always prefer walking 12 kms up the hill .Been there quite a few times, journey has become smoother every time. Kudos to government for making journey smoother anytime.One can enjoy great meals, coffee, maggi with thousand of shops in the way. Do also visit Ardhkuwari, Bhairon mandir along with BhawanShrine board should also work on maintaining better cleanliness near mandir area. Bhawan darshan is mesmerizing, gives ones immense intense pleasure. A must to do thing for every Indian"
511,Jai Mata Di!!,A divine place to be at. Better to book helicopter ride at least for onward journey. One has to walk 3 kms appx up to the temple. As its climbing down so not difficult to walk.
512,Must visit,"Being Indian u dont require an introduction to this place and for others its a most  holy place for Indians who follow HinduismPlace :- u have to reach to a place called as Katra in Jammu.Connectivity :- To reach Katra you have either Train or By Road(Bus/Taxi) - i opted for Train via Jammu to Katra.Katra Station - it is one of the most cleanest stations i have seen in INDIA Stay :- i did online advanced booking in Katra Yatri Nivas which is there inside premises  of Station, Also karta has huge no of hotels you can opt for that.Duration of stay - Minimum 2 days one for visit and one for rest but we did it in one day without taking rest as we were on long travel vacations and lot we have to cover..MOST IMPORTANT - there a ticket counter in Katra Railway Station for vaishno devi visit so must get the ticket for all the members travelling and they will ask for ID proff as well.also on top u have to get them stamp on that which is just not require and waste of time. but get that done as police checks that some times. as a point one person op top can be in queue and family can be other side along with him.How to reach to temple Gate :-  from whom so ever u are booking hotel tell them to pick and drop to entry gate to Vaishno Devi its usually in package or else its easy to get local travels but i suggest to make to bookTravel :- Journey to reach to temple is either trek of 14 kms via walk or with help of horses also if you are planning in day time you have an option of Chopper for which it is an advice to have a very much planned day visit and book the chopper from online website.My Travel:- we plan to walk as trek so we started at 7 PM evening as we reach to katra at 1 PM afternoon and since the month of april 2017 its has intense heat of sun, so we reach to top by 1 am morning and after darshan we started back to trek all way down to katra so total we trek for 28 km in less then 12 Hrs which we fell proud of along with my dream to visit vaishno Devi from childhood , its correct people say only when God calls they only can visit.Food :- if u are in mood to walk dont carry much only mandatory things u carry as all the way u walk will have food shops to eat.So once in life time its a must visit and i fell proud to visit there.Jai Mata Di."
513,Awesome,"The best way to do a vaishno devi darshan is without opting for any package.Catch a train to katra, vande bharat is one of the best trains for directly reaching there. Register for the yatra (the registration point is around 1km from the Katra railway station). Take an auto to the tarakot naya rasta and start the trek. After some walking you'll reach a point where there are 2 ways. 1 way leads to the vaishno devi temple and the other leads to Ardhkuwari temple. Go to the Ardhkuwari temple and after walking for 10 mins you'll reach the temple. Do your darshan and return back from the same route and then take the route to vaishno devi temple. A lot of people do not know about the Tarakot new way to trek to the main Vaishno Devi temple. Now this new way is free of the mules and horses. The only minor problem is that the palki and the child prams are taken through this route. But still better than mules running back and forth. It's a peaceful and serene trek to the Ardhkuwari, Vaishno Devi and Bhaeron temple. Plus the route has 2 langar points where you can halt for a while and have food. One very important thing to remember.If you are going at the start of March, do check out the weather and temperature there. It's pretty cold and rainy in early march. Pack warm fuzzy clothes and a good raincoat."
514,Jor Se Bolo......Jai Mata Di !!!,"Blessed to be called to her abode by the Mata. Everything went smoothly. The pony ride to her Bhawan, the VIP darshan, the Ropeway ride to Bhairav ghati and back, the pony ride to Sanjichat Helipad to the helicopter ride to Katra. All in the span of 7 hours. Jai Mata Di !"
515,#blessed,baad ganga new track was awsmm.. 80 crores has been spent on dat n its worth it.. have selfie point n 4-5 refreshments area.. ccd coffee shops.. filteted ro water... fountains n much more... everyone must take dat path to reach bhawan.. way is superb n clean..
516,Very difficult in rainy days ,One of the most religious Temple of Katra. Every day more than thousands of people coming to visit this Temple walking through the hilly mountain about 3-4 hours. Me with my Family have visited Katra last year. It was very good journey. For me it is one of the most memorable place. Beautiful view from the top of the mountain and very nice and helpful people.

518,Always a delight,"A must visit temple for all. Maha Kali, Maha Lakshmi and Maha Saraswati in one temple. If your health permits and if you are up to it, walk up the hills. You will feel blessed. Tiring and demanding but worth every step. Took me 4 hours for the climb up and 2 hours for the climb down. Helicopter, horse/pony rides and Pallakis are available for those in need. About half of the distance can also be covered in battery operated cars (for PWD and the old aged). Irrespective of the mode you take be prepared to walk for a minimum of 2 to 3 kms for the temple visit. The management board needs to be complemented for keeping the trek route and the temple premises really clean and free of beggars. The temple is open 24 X 7 except for the Aarti breaks. Travel as light as possible because the locker facility near the temple is limited and the wait there to deposit your belongings could delay your visit substantially."
519,Pilgirmage to Trikuta Hills,"Pleasure to stay at Lemon Tree Katra for Vaisno Devi Trip. Great gesture by housekeeping team including Angad, Sunil, Shamlcar, Sachin, Imtiaz, Tariq, Surinder, Ankush and Mehraj. Good and tasty food serving at Citrus. Amazing service and behaviour of the staff. Lovely place to stay outside home to feel home away from home."
520,"Mahakali,Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati Mandir",We visited this place end September . Helicopter cancelled bcos of weather . We took pony at 5.45 am and reached bhawan by 8.45 including half an HR break for pony . It was not too crowded so we had darshan within half an hr . Overall divine experience . As one says if Mata calls you you will definitely reach the place without hassle . Jai Mata di
521,Must visit holy temple ,"this pilgrimage needs one to trek upto 14kms one side . so, be ready for it.Also, it's always better to reach the temple at odd hours to avoid the rush.. we reached at midnight and found no rush at all."
522,Jai Mata Di,"This is one of the best managed Temple in India even with such a big area. Entire road of 11 kms is well covered you don‚Äôt feel unsafe. Regular announcements, shops at regular interval and discounted price & most important it‚Äôs super clean. There are option of horse, walking and battery car. It‚Äôs the most beautiful feeling once u reach Bhawan. Rajma chawal at Rs 40 is super taste and good quantity"
523,"This is one of the holiest hindu shrine. All wishes come true here. ""JAI MATA DI""",Lovely trip . Comfortable stay . Awesome Darsan within 1 hour.  At the time we visited the weather is to cool.
524,One of the holiest shrine ,"excellent energy, very well organised, shrine board is doing a good job, food through out is available and affordable for everyonemonkey problem is a menace a lot of monkey biting happening a lot, which is out of their control"
525,jai mata di,"Religious place of great significance in India where followers of almost every religion goes to gain peace of mind and eternal satisfaction. Moreover it's a beautiful place nature wise as well. Strongly recommended for everyone to visit at least once in a lifetime. Would like to give some tips for the ease and comfort of 1st time visitors....1. Best way to travel is by train touching straight to Katra station. Traveling by air or by road will involve extra time between Jammu and Katra.2. Don't forget to book your room one month in advance if plans are to stay overnight at main Bhawan. Booking opens exactly 30 days before the date of travel, sharp at 10am and generally gets full at 10:05am. No private accommodation available at main Bhawan and hence booking should be done at shrine board's website only. Rooms are cheap and very well maintained + provide great views of Bhawan and sorrounding mountains. However at Katra, a lot of private hotels are available to stay before the commencement and after the end of journey. Must remember to obtain journey slip from dedicated counter at Niharika Bhawan at Katra or online before the commencement of journey.3. Traveling by chopper is the most time saving option (again the same has to be booked well in advance due to high rush), however keeping in mind the religious significance of climbing by foot I won't recommend the same to travelers with young and healthy legs. Options of pony is also available, whereas pithus (human carriers) are good option for comfortable journey of kids.4. People having issues with vegetarian food should stay away from this place. You won't find non vegetarian food anywhere at the entire place. Food quality is also a bit of challenge over this place.5. Total distance of journey from Katra to main Bhawan is 12 KM which can take upto 5-6 hours for person with average fitness. Another 2 KM to Bhairo temple after completing the darshan at main Bhawan. 7. There is no sculpture in the main Bhawan and darshan are available in the form of 3 pindies only. One should consider himself extremely lucky if historical and natural main cave gets opened for darshan, which normally doesn't happen these days due to increasing rush. Now a days darshan are available from two newly created caves.8. A must visit place is at the middle of journey, the Adhkuvari temple, where famous cave of Garbh Joon is situated. The cave is so squeezed that a person can hardly pass out of it but it has a very important religious significance. It's believed that one who passes through it, is sheltered from the cycle of life and death.9. Please carry enough warmers along, as even in summers the weather at main Bhawan is chilling. 10. Please do not carry laptop, iPads or video cameras along as videography is strictly prohibited. Yes, still photography is allowed. 11. The entire place is controlled by army and hence it's advisable to not to wander anywhere except the dedicated route of journey. Also please do not carry any sort of arms and ammunitions.Overall a very nice place to visit specially for the purpose of pilgrimage. JAI MATA DI."
526,Devine,A divine journey of lifetime.Beautiful temple situated on a mountain top surrounded by green tress across couple with snow & swift wind.Winters are the best seasons to visit the holy temple.Avoid rainy season though.Darshan can be done using ponnies or through walk as well
527,Vaishno Devi Temple.,Please call me Every year to see your temple MAA. Each year travel is becoming more easy and comfortable for devotees. Good work by trust and govt. keep it up. Request to people not to throw plastic in everywhere except dustbins. Jai mata di.
528,Shri Vaishno devi Shrine.,Vaishno Devi Mandir is one of the most ancient historic and pilgrimage place in the state of jammu and kashmir.Nearly 7-10 million pilgrims visit there every year.
529,Jai Mata Rani !!!,"although a pilgrimage but truly worth visiting.situated in Katra district of jammu & Kashmir, this is a temple of Maa Vaishno Devi. One needs to cover a long distance but not an issue as one has various options of going by foot, or air travel, or horse riding. And for the ones who cannot walk properly or old age people , Palki facility is there. Do visit, else you gonna miss it."
530,Jai Maa Vaishno Devi,"You must have the physicaly fit to start your journey from Banganga to Bhavan.  A devine place and should visit once in your life time. The nature meets the human, People are coming in group with Musical instruments and step ups by saying...Jai Mata Di."
531,Jai mata Di,One of the most religious place in India.Very nice views.You can walk or take a horse it's up to you.Go with your family.Jai mata di
532,More Commercial Less Devotional,Very good experience. Travelling into the feets of divine GOD is always an amazing experience. Travelled without any difficulty and all basic amenities are present in the path to vaishno devi mandir.
533,Pilgrimage to Trikuta Parbat for Mata Vaishno Devi Darshan.,one of the famous holy place for hindu people. Millions of people visit for worshipping Maa Vaishno Devi. It is  situated at the hieght of 12.5km from katra. Beautiful place ! must go atleast once in life.
534,Very disappointing,"Decided in the morning.  Took train in evening, reaching next morning.  Started uphill immediately after bath and freshen up.  Very lucky to visit the old guffa. Done Bhairon baba too.  Darshan completed when reached back katra by evening 4pm.  I think this is known as ""Mata ka bulawa""!  Thank you ma. Jai mata di."
535,Vaishno devi,This place does not need a review - I would be surprised if anyone in India checks trip-advisor for Vaishno Devi. For people outside India - it is a place of very high religious beliefs in India and is being worshipped by billions in India and abroad. People plan to worship the place whenever possible (Usually once in 2 years but many plan it every year)Multiple convenient ways to visit the shrine has paved way for a hassle free worship.!
536,Holy Shrine..,"It is a place which is known to almost all Indians. It has rust throughout an year. By foot you have to cover around 12 kms one side and helicopter services are available to reach bhawan. During summer, best time is to start by evening and early day you reach to the bhawan and after bath, visit the shrine thereafter head towards Bhairnath temple. During winter, the same can be followed but take care of temp and carry appropriate clothes. It is one of the best place to visit and devotees got the blessings."
537,Kai mata di,"Excellent and beautifully shrine. Now with helicopter service. Well Done walk way with covered roof makes it easier for devotees to have a comfortable darshan. As usual with pithoo service, horse ride and palki service for old people to have a fabulous darshan."
538,Mata Vaishnodevi Shrine Katra,incredible place thousands of devotees come here each and every day to visit the holy mother goddess. here three goddess live here as three stone formation you only get to see the these three goddess 10 to 15 seconds. you have to climb the vaishno devi trek of 14 km up and down this get only 4 to 5 hour to trek on foot and you get there horse ride to climb to top of the hill or helicopter service available from katra. very holy and scenic place love to visit again.
539,Vaishno Devi - Jai mata di,"It is better to go during lean season for very little wait darshan. If you are planning to go by Helicopter to Bhawan and back then factor in the time for darshan of Mata and Bhairon ji ka Mandir which is mandatory and back in time for the helicopter rider back. It is a half an hour trek from Sanchhat helipad to Bhawan, though you can take a pony which will cut down time by 15-20 minutes. You should also factor in the situation that the helicopter ride gets cancelled due to bad weather as well. Helicopter booking needs at least 2-3 months in advance. These days Pony rides and palki rides have been streamlined by the Government and there is no need for haggling and bargain with ponywalas. There are bathing ghats in case you want to take abath before darshan. But they are crowded. The women bathing have very good facilities."
540,Jai Mata Rani !!!,Always a pleasure to visit the Durbar . Things are very organised and we had our holy darshan without any delay and hitch
541,Divine and blissful...,"A visit to his Hill Temple is a must in your life time. The nearest airports are at New Delhi and Jammu. From there take a train. From Jammu it is only 52 km. You can also go by car.There are many hotels there including IRCTC guest house in the station itself. Good, clean and affordable.You have to trek at least 12 km. The hill is steep and will take at least 3.30 hours. You can go by walk or on horse. They charge 700 per person. Or take copter. Best is to book online and choose early morning as pick up time. Most of the time copter service is suspended due to bad weather. While coming down you have the option of traveling through electric car for 6 km. But it is difficult to get. Pre planning is a must. Don't give tips to anyone and don't pay extra. Auto fares are fixed"
542,Trekking to Mata Bhavan on Trikuta Parvat,"With the grace of Mata, I try to visit this place every year. One needs to be have blessings of God to visit this place. If you are a spiritual soul, you are bound to receive a different type of positive energy once you reach Bhawan and have darshan of Mata. As per my personal experience, if a a person wants to walk down to Bhawan, he should follow a consistent speed. The first 3 KMs might give you a bit of challenge if you dont love walking. I will try to keep visiting this shrine till Mata gives me the energy to visit her holy shrine. Jai Mata Di."
543,darshan,"Amazing place took us 5 hours 15 mins to reach darshan line is, it‚Äôs def worth a visit but only those who are called can come when your called your won‚Äôt be disappointed üôèüèº Jay Mata Di"
544,Jai Mata Di,One of best place I ever visited. Thousand of people visit this place daily.The hotels are good with good sanitation facility and also they so cheap.So according to me if you visit this place just opt for hotel which are under the Shrine board as they offer cheap accommodation facility.
545,Trip with friends,"Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan is a place having great devotional value. Three natural pindies of Mata Maha Saraswati, Maha Laxmi and Maha Kali are worshiped here."
546,Visit to Vaishno Devi,Recently visited above temple. Some usefull information:-(1)  Try to visit Katra by train to see the amazing railway station.(2)   Purchase yatra registration slip from the railway stationa itself(3)  purchase local airtel sim card which shops are selling outside the katra railway station.(4) If you have Vodaphone connection then there is no conectivity in Katra(5) the same goes for any pre-paid phone connections.(6)  purchase short stay booking  slip online to stay at bhawan (timming 11.00 am to 3.00 pm)       it charges Ruppes 120 per bed/person.(7) En-route to Bhavan if not visiting sanji chat you can save about one km(8) A new all weathe rmotorable  road is under construction from katra railway station to bhawan which will take you near bhawan in one hour. hopefully will be ready by december 2016.Happy Journey.
547,Holy climbing,Try to stay one night at Bhawan to experience the total atmosphere and blessings of Mata. If possible attend Attka arti. It is an awful experience.
548,REL SAKTHI PEETAM IN A CAVE TEMPLE,We are blessed with very comfortable Mata darshan at end of July. Very less people in Normal Lane.Got 30-50 seconds to pray in front of Holy Pindis
549,Finest example of Religious Tourism,"On reaching Jammu by eve (coz of flight delay due to rain in the first week of Mar'16), picked up by Shri Sardar Yashpal Singh (thorough gentleman, very calm even though flight delayed) for our onward journey to Katra. (Jammu to Katra - Tavera chgs ranging between Rs. 1,500 to 2,000).On the way to Katra, small halt was taken at ""New Trikuta Cafeteria"". We all were tired due to flight delay but hot tea & special treat of Cheese Pakoda made us all refreshed. Due to unusual rain in Mar, climate was bit cloudy & cold. In that climate, cheese pakoda made our day.After being refreshed, continued towards Katra. We had booked Hotel Kerni Palace from Mumbai through tour operator as it was our first visit of SVDK & unaware of good hotels, area location, availability etc. But now I think it would be better to google good hotels, refer TripAdvisor reviews & directly connect to hotel for booking to save some money. (Room Chgs between Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500).Hotel Kerni Palace is located on Jammu Road in Katra. From there, main market is just 5 min away. For elderly parents, option of auto is also available at Rs. 20 per seat. Good hotel campus, garden. Backdrop of Trikuta Mountain is the USP. Courteous staff. Overall good experience. Had our dinner & went to bed early as next day early morning we had to go for Mata Rani's darshan. Jai Mata Ji!Continued..."
550,JAI MATA DI,Always feel like going there. Maa Vaishno takes all your worries and problems and bless you with fortitude and courage to stand steady in all situations.
551,Nice darshan,"Vaishno Devi temple, a beautiful colourful temple, crowded with local and tourist people's , good atmosphere"
552,JAI MATA DI,"Had a good time last year in Vaishno Devi in the mountains.  Quite an adventurous snd spiritual place. People come from faraway places to this pilgrimage site.... the days are hot here and the nights are EXTREMELY cold. There is a good line of shops for supply of food and drinks here.  But we got to see a glimpse of the Goddess after a long wait. The place was very crowded during the whole journey. The roads are covered, in almost all the places, making the roads very convenient for commuting in the hot summers, cold winters, and other seasons. There are helicopters and dulis (palanquin- like things) and electric cars and horses for people to go and come back from Vaishno Devi. Overall, Vaishno Devi is a nice place to visit. Also, Vaishno Devi is a place of great natural beauty with much flora and fauna. Nature-lovers would love this place."
553,A religious hike with family!,"Best Place where you can visit every year , will enjoy walk, darshan , and everything there. all facilities are also available ."
554,Finally Visited and blessed after waiting for so long.,"It is a very historic, holy, near and attached with nature and exciting place. here you can feel sarv dharm sambhav as well"
555,Mata ke Durbar mein,"Had been to Mata Vaishno Devi recently, was blessed with mata's blessings. You won't feel tired even after walking miles. Must visit place."
556,"Very beautiful, holy and calming place ","It feeling so good and relax looking at the Mata Temple and Mountain from Katar and then you start you journey by saying Jai Mata DI, I with my Family travel every year minimum once to take blessings.We always have our all meals at Niaranjan Dhaba in a gali main market the best food of J N K .Unfortunately, the cleanness of Katar and the way to Mata Temple is very sad, all over one can c the shamelessly thrown Plastic, bottles and all dirt ‚Äì it‚Äôs no one to be blamed but us. Jai Mata Di"
557,Jai Mata Ki !!!,"This tour is very good. If we plan well, it will be useful. getdown from train in jammu. come by bus to katra. distance is 14 km. walking will take 6 hrs.Take registration slip from starting point.after finishing darshan, go to bairav baba temple, 2 km away from there.I heard auto is going from bhavan to ardh kuwari.if childern are there, use tht.helicoppter service is difficult to believe, because of weather that may be cancelled. Prepare u r self for walking."
558,Jai Mata Di,"22 June 2014 Start walk at 05 PM from BANGANGA check post, with young kids 10 and 12 years old. reached Ardhkumari at  8 pm. This first 6 km of walk is the most steep one. really tough for legs. Avoid steps. This trail is very busy with walkers, ponies, palkies and shops. Because of ponies it stinks a lot all the way  to Ardhkumari. From there onward last 5 km to Bhawan, there is separate ways for ponies and pilgrims, so much better and fresh air. All the way well laid out path, mostly covered to protect from sun and rain ( no need to carry umbrella or rain jackets). Water, snacks ,beverages , ice cream, and food available all along the way.Toilet facilities are conveniently located  along the way approx at every two km.Reached bhawan at 11pm, with lots of stop on the way. First thing first get your Yatra parchi stamped and get group number for darshan. ( in lean period group number hardly matters, just become a formality ) Book online in advance for accommodation at Bhawan, other wise you will end up sleeping on walk ways around the bhawan. Blanket's are available  free of cost. ( CAUTION : the queue  to get blanket takes almost and hour , so plan accordingly)Before getting in Darshan queue,  you have to lock all bags, phones, cameras, and shoes in locker room. Just go with prashad, parchi and wallet. if the queue is long carry a bottle of water.  Toilet Facilities available along the way while standing in queue.  Common people enters from gate no 3 and VIP pass holders from gate 5 ( VIP pass must be obtained from katra) Sign boards in Hindi and English are very well marked and placed at right place for directions. Do not miss them.Katra to Bhwan you can start walk any time 24 hrs, well safe and lit path. Parchi time at katra is ( 5 am to 11pm) Better to book online  Yatra Parchi, to avoid queue at katra to get yatra parchi. It saves lot time. Near bus stand katra, their is JKTDC locker room available for 24 hrs, Rs 20 per bag.  Yatra parchi counter is also located next to bus stand , along with JKTDC locker room and hotel. On way back we took helicopter. Himalayan Heli services is great choice."
559,Too much rush in june,"I visited vaishno devi this year. The arrangements made by the shrine boards for bhakts were amazing. In the way to temple there were poneys, palkies, battery cars. And a very important thing prepaid SIMs don't work there you need a postpaid one but don't worry as you can get a STD booths on the way if you want to contact someone."
560,Jai Maa Vaishno,"If you wish to feel immortal, you must visit Maa Vaisno Devi temple. It will give immense peace and pleasure. The Bhavan is located on top of trikuta mountain range and the shrine board has made the ascend very easy with too many facilities all over the route.You get food, medicines, toilets are multiple juncture. When you start, please book your yatra parchi online and also dormitory on Bhavan if you wish to stay overnight.Use the newly built ropeway to reach baba Bhairav Bath temple which makes the entire Darsan very easy.Important advice --> go as light as you can, keep only most important things."
561,Jai Mata Di 12th May 2107,Jai mata di. Plan everything before leaving . Rest Mata's blessings are with you.While yatra on track don't argue or interaction with he Vendors having Godrej machine for lemon tea or refreshment as they might harm you and may threaten to life.
562,Jai mata di ,"The shrine os visited for religious reasons. There is a helicopter which takes you from Katra to Shrine....in about 5 minutes...but even after bookings in advance the waiting time at Helipad is close to minimum 1.5 hours to 2 hours. And if you take return ticket then you are asked to reach back helipad in 2.5 hours...How can one finish Vaishno Devi darshan and bhairon darshan in 2.5 hours. I suggest that helicopter operators should tie up with ghodewaala & palkiwaala..and give full deal to the customers. Last time i went by helicopter was 6 years back..it was better managed...this ti,me wait was too long...return journey costs 2010 by helicopter...and the ghoda to shrine & bhairon will charge 975..hence per person total is 3000. Also you are rushing..and wait time at helicopter is min 1.5 to 2 hours.The only good thing is you get VIP darshan pass...An alternate option is to take ghoda from katra....return to katra after both Darshan's is priced at 1800 rupees only. you can get in touch with your friends in Army for a VIP entry...which is quicker....normal wait is about 45 minutes i think...not too sure...Darshan time at shrine is i think less than a minute per person...so please make all your prayers while slowly walking through the darshan tunnel. It has become too commercial over a period of time. For Aarti darshan...per person charge is at 16,000..by paying this amount you can be in bhawan for full aarti time around 20 minutes.When you go to vaishno Devi and get glimpse of Bhavan for a few seconds...feel blessed and enjoy and cherish the moent forever."
563,Jai Mata Di !!!,It's most peaceful temple at the peak of mountain. The way to reach the temple is a long route of almost 13 kms but the peace at the end worth it. Many shops in way. Drinking water at every turn.
564,Jay mata di.,"You need to relax and just leave your trip in safe hands of Mr. Raja from North Yatra. The booking of your Yatra will be safe hands without worry.

565,Divine Experience,14 km trek to reach there is great. if you want to enjoy then dont take horse or palki. we visit every year maa vaishnodevi. its really a great pleasure
566,Vaishno Mata,"I visited hear in 24th of May 2018 with my friends and their family. It's so hot in this month as people gathered hear on occasion of Ganga Dasehra.Unfortunately at that day fire broke out in near by jungle as devotee stopped their journey.Hear always you find rush and lack of management. Don't friend upon merchant things, buy yourself eatery items."
567,Jai mata Ji ,"Definitely it's great place of holiness and divinity, when you came to such a place, you could realize the power of goddess. But only thing i must say, arrangements at the top are  not upto the mark, if you are not with family, than everything is good. But when you are with kids and old person, than you must be ready for pain."
568,A beautiful experience,"An awesome place with lots of blessings from mata Vaishno.Always feel good and eager to be here to have darshan of Vaishno mata.13kms from Katra which goes just like blinking an eye while saying ""Zor se bolo..Jai mata di"". Feels like Maa Vaishno gives strength to walk that much.Now there are many ways to go from Katra to bhawan of Maa Vaishno like you can walk, can have horses(700 Rs one way but they will ask u for more), old aged people can have palki, Helicopter to Sanjichat( 1170 rs one way) or Auto for old aged ppl ( from ardhkawari to Bhawan).There are hundreds of shops on the way where you can eat/drink/massage chairs etc.From Bhawan there is Bhairo baba temple where we have to visit (1.4 kms away) but a steep way.Nice views you can have on d way.Weather was good in June..now they have sheds all the way so no fear of rain and have heard that new way is opening soon where Innova will run and you can easily reach to Bhawan."
569,Vaishno devi trip,"JAI MATA DI-this is the phrase we heard from all through out our journey!it is not at all cumbersome to plan your trip to katra mata's visit . First before taking the tour I browsed many sites and was really worried how myself and my husband( both are senior citizens) going to make use of jai mata's call.It was just simple and if you are true worshipper of God automatically everything made  easy .first do not get panic how  one can  reach that steep hill! first book yatra perchi ticket online itself it is free of cost and  save ones time standing in the Q. one can book for even 2 dates  also whichever date  is convinient to you  depends on your arrival time  and it is better to go in morning time say at 7a.m (we should cross banganga within 6 hours of getting the Y.P ticket )but if we had booked on line we can just go  .The taxi will drop you at banganga from your hotel or any place you stay. most of the hotels opt for free pickup and drop. westayed at asia v.d hotel so it was free for us otherwise they charge 100 re.second step is show your Y.P ticket along with ID card voter ,adar dl any one will do. they will put the seal on the ticket slip and Q separate for ladies and gents . security check will be there . Try not to carry big luggage or bags except your cash that too not in a leather purse  and avoid carrying leather belts pen leather strapped watches etc which is not allowed inside the temple  hence better not to carry all eateries and drinks are available enroute so no worry. after the security check ,you have to choose the mode of transport  1. can hire a horse cost about 1400 per head  up and down including bairon mandir adkuwari mandir. 2. by heicopter halfway -cost 1200 one way (but this also can be booked in advance thro v.d mata shrine board.-do not trust anybody by giving money to book for helicopter) and again for 2 km walk or electric car or horse from the helipad. 3. by palki where 4 persons will carry  you can sit on a cushioned chair like thing.cost about 4000 per person4. by walk -many youngsters walk with a stick on. but we selected horse ride and we carried extra cusion to make  ourselves comfortable to sit on the pony. the  rider was very good and took great care of us we enjoyed the up ride but on coming down itwas bit painful and tiresome since we had good dharsan of jai mata all our sufferings vanished in no time.the rider took us straight to bhavan where we purchased  offerings for mata in the shrine board counter ( many private counters also sell) and i carried a saree to offer to mata.  we kept our shoes and belongings in a counter on the left side .many stairs are there but onlly one can go and leave  everything and get a coupon and then enter the                                      small gate on the right hand side  the security will check your y.p slip tear it and give the counterfoil straight leads to bhawan on the way many security checks are there but hardly took 2 mins after entering the arched  marble tunnel one can feel the positive energy and your mouth utters jai mata di  always in full spirit  once you reached the place can see mata kali saraswathi and lakshmi in pindi forms and the panditji was very kind enough to explain and allowed us to pray for sometime.  with our full satisfication of worshipping (they do not take any money except our offerings to god) we moved on to see the big water falls  just next to the god we can even pour the water on our head too! thats all ! from there the horse rider took us to bairon mandir where we collected the  sacred ash from agni kundam and came down to see adkuwari we went to the other route to see the goddess instead of tunnel route since it was heavy crowd. but we had good dharsan and came down . the whole travelling time took us 6 to 7 hours only. again back to hotel from banganga.vaishno devi mata shrine board is doing wonderful jobin maintaining the wholeroute so clean and trouble free hats off to them and the goddess has given the opportunity to  make the animals and manyworkers to lead their life comfortably too!  this is a awesome trip which one should not miss in their life time!"
570,Jai mata di ,"Jai Mata di. Holy place with many hotels available on the internet to book. book the hotel and helicopter, if needed, in advance. Never had a problem to reach to the temple. If helicopters are not available then also you will find many poters for kids and old people and horses for young people to ride.Must visit the cave where devi hid for months.After cave, go to the main temple and then bhahrav mandir at the end."
571,Must visit if you are a believer of Shakti peeth,"Holy cave, Holy ambiance, Holy Shrine, Mountain of believe and of course good for health too. I feel very relaxed once returning and darshan from here. Thousands of people come here for a gimps of Darshan of Pindi even having trouble in tracking. It's all about aastha . Shrine board does a very good job but ye dil mange more. Jai mata Di."
572,Holy and spiritual,Jammu Airport to Katra visit through prepaid taxi at the rate of 1531. Staying in a hotel call Hotel call Krishna. Try to avoid this hotel due to non hygiene. But it is close to Bal Ganga.Walking distance around 5-7 minutes. But hotel is secure in terms of family. Local dry food shop and other available near by hotel. Hotel staff are friendly and caring through out.from Bal ganga to bhawan is secure to visit 24 hrs. Night time is ideal. We don't face any problem when return back from Bhawan to hotel at midnight. Agree Mata baishnab Devi Mata Katra rail station is nearby. One of the cleanest railway station I have seen. Recommend for family trip.
573,Jai Mata di!!! ,Jai Mata Vaishno is Greatest Sakti all over the country. Mata Vaishno Mahima is known to every one. Must visit for everyone who need Mental Peace and get rid of all the Problem. Mata Vaishno will Solve your Problem. You can take Online Yatra Patchi too before Start
574,Mata darshan ,"This is one of the holiest shrine of Hindus .The place attract almost 01 crore  pilgrims/tourist .The place has gone many changes in last 50 years.The original deity is located in a cave .Earlier the hoy cave was having a narrow message with natural spring flowing at bottom.The cave could be entered only after bending your body or lying on floor position.Now much more improvement has done.The 12-14 km route from Katra can be covered by Helicopter or E rickshaws or on foot.The path is well lighted and covered with sheds and visit continue 24 hours except some intrupution s from bad weather or land slide.The chanting of ""JAI MATA KI"" is itself a unique experience.The climbing is not easy so old person can hire Palki or horse also because helicopter and E rickshaw can not cater the total requirement.Life time moment which is performed by innumerable BHAKTS.People even visit at monthly or marginally more frequencies.The place is managed by a public  charitable well managed trust with support from all Govt agencies.The photography is not allowedJAY MATA DI"
575,Darbar of Maa,"All credit to Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine board. The whole path is well concrete, well covered and cleaned throughout the day. All Pony going with you is a bit annioying for the walking pilgrims but thankfully pony-dung is broomed away every minute. Well managed atable stalls at comfortable distance. Convinient and clean toilets.Mata darshan streamlined. VIP queue available at extra cost. Helicopter ride is worth every penny. Well managed.  Book online much in advance. JAI  MAATA  DI"
576,Simply Divine and holistic,What a beautiful place to go . Blessings of ma Vaishno will give you the strength to get danshan of Maa. All your wishes will be fulfilled if u go with believe........Jai Mata deeeee
577,Simply Heaven,Visit to the temple was a very spiritual one .It is tiring however the will to reach the top to visit the Mandir keeps one going.
578,Jai Maa Vaishno Devi,The feeling of being at Vaishno devi can not be described in words but it is to be felt and a must for any hindu and I'd say anyone who wants to experience the God. The journey is tough for sure..Your body aches like hell even if you hire ponies or palana there. And the rates are fixed by the administration there but sometimes the ponnivala tries to ask for the excess money at that case complain to near by police post.....There's a CCday and Sagar Ratna during the hiking which serve authenticated food. Though the helicopter root is different  and easier to travel through helicopters but sometimes they don't fly because of bad whether and normally it's chilly at the peeks. So check the whether conditions beforehand. There are numerous chai and busicuit shops and also some Dhabas but except sagar ratna at the Bhawan don't expect much from the food front. And Sagar Ratna is always crowded but it's good. The morning and evening aartis are must and immortalise your experience if you get to do it.
579,Divine Grace of Mata Vaishno,Vaishno Devi Mandir is a world famous temple located in the foothills of Trikuta Hills of Jammu and Kashmir. People from all walks of life from all around the globe visit it to seek blessings of diety Vaishno Devi. I totally recommend vistinng the temple once in alifetime atleast.
580,Jai mata di,"Vaishno Devi is a very revered Goddess by many Hindus and people from across the country come to visit here. There are 3 places to visit, Ardh Kumari, Main Temple and Bhairo Baba. The total hike till Bhairo temple is around 17-20 Kms. There are 2 ways to reach there, one is new and the other one old. Both these ways meet each other at Ardh Kumari. The distance till Ardh Kumari through the new way which is less steep and clean is around 8Kms while the old way which is more steep, dirty and crowded due to the horses is around 6 Kms. The new way also is beautifully landscaped with many clean seating arrangements (benches) across the way. The old road has lesser seating arrangements and most of them are not very clean.Ardh Kumari visit takes a very long time and the waiting time may be more than 24 hours also. Distance from Ardh Kumari to main temple (Bhawan) is another 6-7 Kms and the distance to Bhairo temple from the Bhawan is around 2.5 Kms which is a very steep climb.It is difficult to visit the temple in a single day and return back. So, most people have to stay and take rest at night. It is very difficult to get a dormitory or a room in one of the guest houses. The rooms are too few and get full as soon as they are available. The only option is to stay in a community hall or outside. It is very uncomfortable to stay in these places with thousands of people around you. There are blankets which you can get for free by giving a refundable deposit of Rs. 100, but many of these are not clean and may have lices, germs and even bed bugs. Another option is to get a free bench and lie down for sometime. You can store your valuables(phones etc.) in free lockers provided by the temple management while visiting the main bhawan.Overall its a very spiritual experience, and the hardship also becomes a part of the experience which you can remember. Although the temple management is doing a lot like introducing cable car, battery vehicles etc., a lot has to be done in terms of cleanliness and lodging. But it is a must visit place for every Hindu, and even people from other religions who believe in Vaishno Devi Mata for there desires to come true, once every year or at least once in few years."
581,Reaching the top is quite difficult,You feel like you have been brought to the Goddess Durga the moment you reach the Shrine cave. The Management of Shrine board is very great in comparison to all the Shrines I have visited till date. The Prasad is also very much subsidized and quantity is enough.
582,Words are less to describe,"The much heard about Vaishno Devi yatra is something that you don't try very often. The temple is approximately a 12 hour walk uphill. You may choose to cover this distance walking as most people do, on a horse but honestly the conditions in which the horses are kept just seems like animal cruelty or on a palki. Alternatively, you can avoid all this with an expensive helicopter ride.The only downside is that after all the walking, you get a darshan of less than 30 seconds as the number of devotees are too many for the temple to handle. Seems fair, i think."
583,Holy Shrine,"The bhawan is about 12-13 kms from the banganga checkpoint. The journey takes about 10-12 hours to complete depending on your fitness levels. It gets really cold during winters, so better be prepared."
584,ATTKA ARTI BOOKING AT VASNO DEVI,It a very nice temple situated just nearby by river which provides a scenic Beauty. It is easily accessible and gives a feel of Vaishno Devi temple of katra.
585,Devine place,"Traveled to the holy temple by Helicopter from Katra. Very convenient, and organized. Was able to complete the Katra-Bhawan-Katra in roughly 4.5-5 Hrs."
586,Sakthi in the valley - Jai Mata Ji.,Pleasant place. Powerful goddess. Had good blessings. we cannot write comments in words for the diety.
587,An eternal feeling....,"A spiritual and religious place. Vaishno Devi temple is one of the most famous and most visited holy places in India. You can't stop yourself enjoying the nature's beauty and spending time at every step of yours there. Two options of transportation are available to reach Katra. One is Through Railway transportation and the other is through the flight.Moving upwards the path will take you to the holy shrine of mata Vaishno Devi and Bhawan where you can do the Pindi darshan. Earlier you had to enter the temple in through cave. Now, they have made another way. People enter making a queue. At this place, you can't even take your purse along with you. You have to keep them at the security point. They will guide you.I enjoyed the whole journey seeing natural beauty, rivers, temples, the crowd, Ponies, Palanquin, Monkeys and their romance on the mountain hill. Touching the clouds I felt I've come to the land of sky and clouds. The purity of nature attracted me so much that I can't explain in words! The night was amazing there. I was happy and sad both while coming back."
588,exceellent vibration,"Jai Mata Di......In my point of time February is the right time to visit here. Before started your journey register your self on katra or online named as ""Yatra Parchi"".

590,Jai Martha Di,Our experience every time has been really nice visiting the temple. We have always walked up the path and felt really good about it. It is advisable to get into the habit of walking if you are going there from a city life style. Food available is always without onion and garlic and makes me wonder each time how can they make it so tasty without adding any onion and garlic. Don‚Äôt forget to keep your mobiles in your lockers as all pockets are checked and mobiles aren‚Äôt allowed. Jai Mata Di
591,Jai mata di!!,"This is holy pilgrim trip with Natural spots and trecking experience all together. This is 13.5 km trecking from Katra bottom camp. There are different options available to reach bhavan from Katra. ponies are available and managed by trust. Electric vehicles were also operated earlier, but due to some localities issue those were stopped now. Helicopter service is available up to Sanjichhat. one more option is paalkhis which are operated by 4 persons. all these operations are maintained by Trust.During your visit to vaishno devi darshan, there are total 5 spots one should visit. details are as follows,1. Ban ganga: After parchi Check post, pilgrims reach to small bridge under which banganga flows. Piligrims like to Bath in it before Proceeding further. based on time of visit some  people will skip this. It is believed that Mata Vaishno Devi created this river by using arrow. it is also said that Mata taken a dip in it and had washed her hair here. it is approx 1 km from Katra2. Charan paduka: It is located 1.5 km from Ban Ganga, where Mata Charan Padukas imprinted on Rock slab. One who take darshan here will feel that touching mata's paduka and seeking her blessings. normal days it will take few minutes only for darshan here.3. Adhkuwari Gufa: This one of the crowded and important spot in your trip. There is common belief that in case you fail to visit this place you haven't completed this holy Pilgrimage.  Location of this temple is almost half of your trip, which is 4.5 km distance from Charan Paduka. there are 2 routes to Bhavan before reaching to Adhkuwari. So be careful while choosing the route. this route is half kilometer more compare to other route, but worth to watch. Here darshan will be in groups and limited per group. So it will take time to have your turn. If it is more than 8 hours of waiting then take parchi and have mata darshan first and in return you can have this temple darshan. Story of this cave is that Goddess Vaishno devi stayed here for Nine Months when Bhairon was Chasing Her.4. Bhawan: Bhawan is 7 km away from Adhkuwari, which is the ultimate destination of the Yatries. Inside the holy Cave the goddess revealed her self in the form of holy pindies manifesting Mata in her three forms Maha Kali, Maha Laxmi & Maha Saraswati.5. Bhairon Temple: This is final destination of yatra, which is another 1.5 km from Bhawan. After leaving adhkuwari Mata started ascending uphill till she reaches holy Cave (Bhavan). Bhairon Nath located her again in Cave and started challenging her. so finally Goddess severred the head of Bhairon Nath. Bhairon Nath's Head flew away and fell on another mountain, which is present bhairon Temple. It is saying that goddess granted him a boon, where by every devotee has to visit Bhairon Temple to complete the Yatra. So After your Bhairon Darshan only Yatra will be considered as Completed.Jai mata di..."
592,The most holiest place... Jai Mata Di !!!,Reaching Katra has become easier with the opening of the railway link upto Katra. The entire stretch is covered to make the climb up/down much easier. the stretch is also dotted with concrete made seats for resting. Enough ponies/horses available for people who cant walk. Secured lockers available to keep your belongings safe.
593,Jai mata di,"Shrine Mata Vaishno Devi is one of the most sacred temples visited by devotees from all over the world. Vaishno Devi also known as Mata Rani is a manifestation of Durga, a Goddess as per Hindu mythology.  It is located in Trikuta Hills near Katra at a height of 1560 metres above sea level.  The nearest airport or major railway  station is Jammu from where one can go to the base of the temple at Katra by bus or cabs. A devotee can trek up the 13 Kms which is very well lighted throughout day and night or fly by Helicopter which is priced reasonably. Alternately one can go up by Ponies or Porters.  It is crowded during holidays and Navratras. It is advisable to book Darshan tickets and stay at the temple or Katra well in advance by online reservation from the Shrine Board Office. A temple of faith where every true devotee will find peace of mind."
594,awesome and beautiful experience ..truly divine,"A temple of maa vaishnavi where you can not visit unless you get a call from Her.. place full of spiritual energies.... As per Ramayana , Sri Ram told mas vaishnavi to stay at Trikuta Parvat till He comes back to earth in his next incarnation as Kalki Aavtar at the end of Kaliyug"
595,Jai Mata Di! A pilgrimage which gives you solace,"Nearly a minute of darshan. Jai mata di. With the helicopters, ropeway and battery cars it becomes much easier for people who face health issues. Must visit."
596,Jai mata di,"Jai Mata Di, it's a holy place and it's pure divine. I try my best to visit the place once a year and take blessing.It's all on to you how you look at this place."
597,Jai Mata Di - complete story for Travellers,Facilities by shrine board is good.. however few suggestions ...for locker facility need to get down 100 steps not advisable for sr citizen and heart patients ... Place is not recommended for handicap people... return helicopter never available .. while coming up one way ticket is given and whole coming down no tickets available then they want corruption for the same to book u on copter...
598,Must visit place,"Have been going through since my childhood but every time, I visit it is a new experience. Get amazed to see the belief of millions of people those who the shrine every year."
599,Highly organised process and super cooperative staff,This is a place where I have been coming past 50yrs and no one ever could go empty handed MAA BLESSES ALL WHEN YOU COME AND ASK ANYTHING FROM MAA
600,Simply adventurous,"After such a tiring journey of about 12 km till the top what you get is nano seconds glimpse of the pind. No direction of where the temple is when u reach at the top you just have to follow the crowd. Never seen such poorly managed temple. The security guard were literally manhandling the people when they reach to pind not just males but females and elderly as well. We were shocked to see such rude behaviour. And there was not much queue we reached to the pind in just 10 mins after reaching to the top. Have been to all other major temple but the management here was pathetic.A peace of advice close ur eyes remember the image of goddess and her pinds, feel her warmth and get her blessing. And go for trekking to a better place. God is inside you!! Jai mata di !!"
601,You need to do this at least once,"June is certainly the most hectic month for planning a trip to Vaishno Devi. It was a sudden unplanned trip for my husband and me. We boarded Uttar Sampark Kranti on Friday night from NDLS and morning around 10 AM we were at Katra Railway Station. From there we hired an auto to bus stop to take Yatra slip and then to Banganga to start onward journey to Bhawan. If you plan to do a to and fro journey in a day it is advisable to either take horse or a helicopter at least one way. We were lucky enough and by the blessings of Mata we were able to do the darshan around 3 PM and journeyed down by 7 PM. There is a new way for pilgrims travelling by foot known as tarakot marg. Though the route is little longer but it does not have hassles of pony, horses and is less commercialized. We came back by Shri Shakti Express that runs at 2250 hrs. All in all a memorable experience."
602,Jai Mata di,Excellent trip and Yatra. Going with a group was more fun and doable in walking 15km uphill and climbing down more than 2000 steps. Weather was just awesome. It poured for few hours while we were very close to bhawan. That really made weather very very pleasant .The new route is beautifully Done. Locker facility was easily available. Thanks to tips given by lemon tree hotel staff. Overall a superb experience. Jai mata di!
603,Different Feeling,Very spiritual place .Right from the beginning of the journey you start feeling wonderfulabout the  place .The path of 14 km to Bhawan seems nothing in-front of the devotees devotion.You can  go on foot or can hire pony .Always deal with authorized person and negotiate before hiring a pony .The Vaishno Devi shrine has done the very good arrangement of the path ..It is well maintained .You will find drinking water and toilet after each small distance.After reaching the Bhawan it will take around 2-5 hours depending upon rush.Overall very good experience. I will definitely go next year also.
604,Good,"Family of four, started our journey around 10:00PM. Kids were eager to go on foot, started well though soon gave up. After approx 2 KM, got a pony for them till Adkuwari. They managed to walk from there till end of journey with enough breaks / rest.Coffee / Cold Drinks / Mango juice did help a lot during the journey. Watching Kids & elderly climbing are enough motivation for others to keep going.We walked on our way for Darshan and took Helicopter ride for return."
605,Jai Mata di,"A long pending visit. Planned to leave from Delhi on Night of Diwali. Booked helicopter tickets in advance and accommodation at Ardh Kumari. There was absolutely no rush.Lot of changes since last visited 14 years back. Shrine board doing excellent job. Will recommend to avail services of Shrine board outlets for Bhaints, Prasad, Souvenir and food etc. Very well priced with good service. The helicopter services were bit unorganized. Did not give VIP Darshan Pass though had both side journey booked.Overall a good experience___ JAI MATA DI"
606,Some helpful tips,One of the best place to make your self free from world Jai mata ki Beauty And interesting place to spend time
607,Vaishnodevi,"Very beautiful .enjoy the solace . understand the bhavana behind the mandir. walk your way up , start early and finish early without crowds . sing and dance ur way up , one does not feel the pain then and time passes fast"
608,Journey to Bhawan was very thrilling,We started at 12 noon for the darbar and reached 6.30 with two short breaks on the way. Inspite of the winter month we were sweating after reaching top. We did darshan in 3 hours. Most of time was spent in queue for the cloak room. It is better to use one in the begining as this near to bhavan is very crowded. We started climbing downwards as 10 and reached hotel by 2.00 A.m
609,Jai Mata Di - A great heart-filled Darshan,"Hinduism is not a religion..it's a way of life n so the journey to  Vaishno Devi proves what power faith can have on individuals.Thousands of people walking up the hill chanting the magic mantra ""Jai Mata Di"" at all time of day n night..it's a feeling to experience n a sight to be seen!!"
610,Jay Matadi,"DISTANCESKatra ‚Äì2kmÔÉ† Baanganga ‚Äì6 kmÔÉ† Adhkuwari ‚Äì5.5 km-> Bhawan ‚Äì4 km-> Bhairav babaASCENT OPTIONS: Horse, Paalki, Walking and HelicopterPREPARATION1> Yatra parchiRemember to take yatra parchi before starting your ascent. It‚Äôs easier to book it only through Mata Vaishno Devi website i.e. maavaishnodevi(dot)org. Or if you forget, you can get it on a counter near bus stand in Katra, and there are some other places too where you can get it (ask).2> Helicopter:If you want to book a helicopter, you will have to book two months in advance. And tickets are gone with 5 mins of the opening of quota. So you have to be on your toes. Booking for helicopter opens at 10 am 2 months before the travel date.The helicopter takes off in Katra from near Railway station and drops you at ‚ÄúSaanjhi Chhat‚Äù which it only 2 kms from Bhawan. Usually, people book a return ticket, which usually gives you 3-4 hours at Bhawan to complete darshan.3> Room at Bhawan:Getting a room when you reach there, or getting a room booked in advance online is a big challenge. Picture this: you want to travel 60 days from now, and go maavaishnodevi(dot)org and try booking a room ‚Äì it would have gotten filled up like tatkal of IRCTC4> Clothes: Be prepared for all-weather. You will feel sweat at times, and chill at other times. Keep clothes keeping this in mind.Katra to Baanganga is 2 kms, and people usually take an auto, which charges 100 rupees on this date (200 if you are coming back)THE ASCENTLeg 1: Katra to Adhkuwari:The journey starts from the gate/checkpoint near Baanganga, the road has uneven width, and is flooded with ponies, paalkies and people-on-feet. Has numerous small shops on the way, for misc and pooja related items, medicines, and govt licensed eating joints (named samir etc), and a caf√© coffee day at about 3.5 kms from the checkpoint.Leg 2: Adhkuwari to Bhawan: From Adhkuwari, there are 2 routes to Bhawan ‚Äì old route which is only used by ponies these days ( it is 6.5 kms long), and the new route which is used by people-on-feet and by paalki carriers. The new route is completely covered with a shade, and has ‚Äòeven‚Äô flooring, and is usually very clean.Note: This path being covered with shade has a small drawback too. Due to lack of direct sunlight, it may feel a bit of cold even during the day (esp. in Oct-Mar period)Note 2: Beware of monkeys.AT BHAWANThere are multiple guest houses namely Manokaamna bhawan, Gouri bhawan etc. There are some restaurants incl a Sagar Ratna before the entry point (checkpoint / luggage scanner point)The new lockers are a floor below, so need to go down/up about 30 steps (it‚Äôs a bit of a pain, really when you have to climb steps barefoot after keeping your shoes in the locker). Note: Prasad bag (that standard oh-so-common jute bag) is no longer available beyond the gate # 3, so one has to buy it before the checkpoint i.e. before Sagar Ratna.Note 2: Be prepared for a bare feet walk on wet marble when you get inside the small cave like structure for the darshan. I have seen people getting cold through their feet and even fainting. First aid is available though, very close to the entry of the cave.BHAWAN TO BHAIRAV BABAI don‚Äôt have many details on this.Tips:1> Travel light. Means don‚Äôt make your stomach full, and control those urges to gobble dosas/sandwiches/chips and gulp coffee/tea every now and then. Doing this keeps you fit and reduces time to climb up/down.2> Take a stick long with you. It helps. Also have a small water bottle, a cap and very good shoes with enough cushion to make your ascent/descent comfortable.3> Take a ‚Äúpitthoo‚Äù (a paid servant) who will carry your bags, or your small kids (up to 3 years) and will even massage your feet/legs when required. The current charges are 700 per round trip (katra to Bhawan and back) or 800 for Katra to Bhairav Baba and back. Take a picture of his Id proof and his mobile number before starting your journey.4> Beware of ponies and paalkies who have enough momentum to knock you down, esp. during descent. Their carriers will say ‚Äúside‚Äù, sometimes not so audibly.5> At Katra, try to spend the least time and start your journey at the earliest. Though most crowd starts ascent after 2 pm, which leads to a huge rush in evening hours at Bhawan.6> The cave closes for Aarti at 5:30 pm, and is closed for 3 hours. So, you are much better off completing darshan before 5, or else wait till 9/10 pm.7> If walking / on feet, the ascent takes between 3.5 to 6 hours, depending on your health/fitness level, your urge to reach early, and on how much you stop / eat on the way. The descent takes 2-4 hours. These numbers totally exclude the time spent at Adhkuwari complex.As an end note: The trip on feet is all worth it. And yes, overall commendable upkeep by the shrine board now-a-days."
611,amazing feeling,Family vacation point was good and the Fareham was like feel at heaven... and mata hi blessed us was also a good point... love u maa
612,Soulful Place.,"Very good spiritual place, must visit once in lifetime. It's 13Km journey by climbing the hill and feel the nature and spirit once you reach at top."
613,Place of worship full of cheaters,Spiritual place.Hygiene washrooms.Clean roads.Divine feeling.Ultimate weather.SuggestionsYatri on horses must be shifted to new route.Why Rs.5 charged by auto rikshaw above their charges. Pre paid auto rikshaw is also seems fishy.
614,Palace is heaven but people are not knowing how to stay in heaven,"We had a great family bonding time when we start walking to the shrine in the evening and reach there past mid-night, The place was chock-a-block with people but we had a good visit. But the walk way back down was very tiring.But eventually it was dream come true to have visited the place once in a lifetime.I would recommend people to book to helicopter ride well in advance to avoid the walk."
615,An Holy experience of a lifetime,Had a wonderful smooth darshan amidst cash demonetisation..disposed all 500 notes to coolies and palkhi wala..plan well in advance for your darshan .avoid bad weather months like june and july ..have a return helicopter ride and hire a palkhi or pony if you cant trek or walk ..Rest leave it to devi...she knows best..jai mata di !!
616,Jai Mata Di,"This is a place on the peaks where it's not easy to reach before but due to the facilities provided by the Jammu and Kashmir Government, it becomes far easy now.It is totally 14 km from down to up till temple. It will take the 6-7 hours for a middle-aged person to reach the temple without bog breaks the Facilities of Horses and Pitthu is available there. Special services are there for the handicap and old aged people. On the way to temple, you will get shops of water and other eatables easily but they charge us double the price. and seating arrangement is there for rest in between. You will find crowd everytime as its tourist attraction also. It's easy to reach there but buses are going at particular times. and you will easily get the auto's from here to go anywhere and explore the city. for shopping its good to Bargain."
617,Extension of visit Invitation by Ma Vashionodevi.,"A must visit place, best time to visit vaishnodevi is mid of jan till 1st week of feb. I have been to Vaishnodevi couple of times and every time we visit we witness new things introduced throughout the Yatra. The amenities provided by shrine board is commendable, free medical aid, food and lodging with quite a reasonable price. The trail which go up in the hills to the Darbar is all well covered and sheltered. Pretty much happy with the development done by the shrine board."
618,Improvements all the way,"went there for first time , I am loving the place , after going there I forget all my worries , the place is very natural any peaceful , thousands of people but then also very peaceful .JAI MATA DI !!!!!!"
619,Good,"No need to describe Vaishno Devi . most of the Hindu Family following Hindu Dharma aware about Ma Vaishno Devi. I am regular visitor there . this was my 6th Visit.in this visit we did some thing different. we booked Aatka Arti Darshan online there are 2 slot for Aarti morning 5 AM and evening 6 PM . and you are allowed to participate in Aarti and followed by Darshan and you will also get Mata Chunri and Prasad also. it was good experience.please must visit Bharonath Mandir and Ardhakumari cave. waiting time in Ardhkumari Cave is approx 15 hours. so once you reach Ardhkumari from Banganga , before proceeding to Bhawan , take Ardkumari number. and by the time you will back after Darshan from Bhawan . you may not be able to wait for 2-3 hours in Ardhkumari."
620,Mata abode ,Awesome temple and very very old cave temple and very famous temple in Hindus and devotee can will be book the helicopter ticket or can be sit on pondis or palki or by walking
621,Must visit,"Nice place for visiting and spiritually as well. Multiple food courts and lot of fun for children, aishno Devi, also known as Mata Rani, Trikuta and Vaishnavi, is a manifestation of the Hindu Goddess Mata Adi Shakti also known as Chandi/Durga."
622,Jai Mata Vaishnodevi,very nice experience by going with family and traveling for around 30 kilometers in 12 hours. An excellent temple to visit.
623,A walk from Katra to vaishno devi mandir,"To seek Mata's blessings some 14 kms walk is required. If you are unable to walk then hire a pony or a palanquin. Helicopters are also available but their booking has to be done in advance. But the road which leads to the temple is always full of devotees. Which makes it too easy for everybody.  When you see the Mata's, you get so happy and forget all your worries."
624,Good place,"It is one of the must see cave shrine located on a hill top about 15 km from Katra Railway station. You can go by walk, phony and helicopter. At the end of the day, you will feel blessed."
625,Blessed,"This is dream place.. you feel relaxed, motivated, pumped up walk of 11 kms it super fun place is very well maintained by Shrine board. A visit in any season"
626,JAI MATA VAISHNO DEVI,"Devotees go when the mother calls.The temple of Maa Vaishno Devi is set on the Trikuta Mountains. There is a direct climb of 13 kms from Katra, 52 kms away from Jammu. The Ardhkumari temple is situated in the half of the route. By seeing the mother all the fatigue is removed. All the facilities  for the devotees by the temple trust are available on the routeKatra is now connected by rail for devotees. Helicopter services also available from katra."
627,food for soul,"The Shrine and the surroundings are well maintained by the Authorities/ Trust. The climb uphill and then downhill was an experience. Though the roads uphill are well paved, the road is covered is with Mule dung. As the same road is used for the people on mules at different spots, we need to be alert.Also, while coming down, we need to be careful with our belongings especially food bags. Monkeys attack and try snatching them away.There are several beautiful spots on the way where you can take a break and relax.Overall the whole experience was enriching and refreshin, though tiresome."
628,Must go mata ne bulaya hai,"This is such a pious thing to visit this temple.  You will find inner peace and just cann't explain the feeling you will have when your are here.  after comfortable and beautiful trekking it is so relaxing to have darshans,"
629,exhilarating,"Katra is base point, take review of climate if helicopter booking is done and with doubt of H service will not work, take pony and proceed upstairs, waiting time for Darshan is as per your luck, generally safe place, arrangements of food, water , toilets etc are there on 14 km way by shrine board"
630,Journey to Vaishno Devi temple,Most awesome experience one have here. the Shrine Board is doing commendable job in providing great facilities for pilgrimage
631,Divine place,"Though I could not make it till the summit due to not so good health, I tried to walk up for some distance and then came back. The journey was pleasing with so many people eagerly and enthusiastically moving forward and encouraging others in the process. The walk also provided beautiful sights of the surroundings and is definitely a cherishing experience."
632,Jai Mata Di,Just love this place ...one of the best holy place I ever visited in the north region with so nice facilities ...
633,Jai mata di,"There was little bid hot at Katra, but at the bhawan weather was awesome and memorable.. And one suggestion for all, please avoid the New way for Katra-Adhkumari or Adhkumari-katra. It's not good. 3 km longer than old road."
634,VAISHNODEVI MATA DARSHAN,"Vaishno Devi is one of the holiest Hindu Pilgrimage site which is dedicated to Goddess Shakti. Pilgrims, especially Hindus from all over the world visit Vaishno Devi making it the second most visited shrine in India after Tirupati Balaji Mandir. All kind of people, whether they are rich or poor, young or old, sick or healthy take the challenging trek from Katra to get to this holy place. Just join any group that is climbing to the cave and feel the devotion run down your body with every breath you take. The groups sing religious songs praising the goddess non stop till they reach the top. It is just an amazing experience to see so many people devoted to their devotion to Mata Vaishno Devi. There are many tea stalls and Dhabas along the way where you can stop for a while and take rest. On your Vaishno Devi tours, while resting or even while walking, just look around for the resplendent scenic beauty that surrounds you."
635,Jai Mata Di,Its the best place to visit as the view from Trikuta mountain top is undescribing...All enjoy cool breeze and seek blessing visit Vaishno devi
636,Worship + Fun,"This place is both a religious pilgrimage and a family/friends vacation. Collect lots of memories on the way to the famous Vaishno Devi Shrine with amazing views of the Katra Valley and the chants of ""Jai Mata Di"" doing the favours. It is an ardous climb but the facilities and shops by the Shrine Board have made it easier for the pilgrims alike. Go in winters and have a chilly weekend ahead with friends."
637,Maa ka Bulawa aaya tha,"I visited with friends from India who made all the arrangements on my behalf so I can't speak to that. I can say that it was very worthwhile. There are the usual hawkers but people doing the pilgrimage are very friendly. I took a pony and thought we would walk up alongside my friends, but once on the pony, the guides run them up to the top so they can maximise their working time. They do not check your comfort levels with this beforehand... Perhaps you could negotiate this at the outset. Visited the darshan during the evening. Part of a trailing queue that didn't feel so special but was necessary with the numbers at this time of the year wanting to visit. I stayed in a dorm in bunks with friends in Bhawan and it was basic. I recommend ear plugs. Blessed with snow overnight that just topped off the whole experience. Felt very close to the divine. Took the chopper ride back down the mountain and that was another highlight."
638,Nice,What I personally think it is a place where I find peace and filled myself with lots of energy I really feel lucky to get opportunity to have Darshan of mataLush green Valley with Hills surrounded
639,Jai Mata Di,Vaishno Devi temple is located at the top of the hill in a serene place. If you are very interested in going to temples you would enjoy though inside the temple in front of the actual shrines you get only few seconds. We went in May end and it was too crowded. We managed to get a helicopter booking and so could reach up pretty easy. I would recommend that you first acquire the boarding pass to get your group number and reach the helipad only at the designated time. There is hardly any sitting space if you have a long waiting time.  Inspite of this we had a wait time of 1-1.5 hrs. From helipad to bhawan is a downhill walk so easy but returning is pretty difficult. This time along with the palki and horse we could see people with strollers on rent for small kids. The weather was extremely hot. The queues could be very long for general people though priority Darshan slips are issued to people with return chopper tickets( one way ticket holders aren‚Äôt given the same). Still be ready for atleast 1 hr wait time. You also see lot of monkeys. Do not try to instigate. They are not afraid of humans and won‚Äôt hesitate to attack if needed. overall  just the hike with family is pretty enjoyable.
640,we loved our journey,"Visiting Mata Vaishnodevi on the Trikut mountains is a very memorable experience - especially when you do it on foot. One must visit this place at least once in lifetime. The shrine board has made excellent facilities for the devotees - the accommodation, eateries, the newly made cemented route etc. makes it much easier for the devotees to visit the place even on foot. There are other modes to reach the top, such as palkhis (palanquins), ponies, pithooos, helicopter. All in all, it is a great experience."
641,One of the most religious place in India,There is nothing we can review about vaishno devi mata as she is the one who taked care of us all the time
642,Pilgrimage ,Best pilgrimage with wonderful scenery view.Visit the temple in month of may as it is the best time with moderate weather and bearable temperature.
643,Jai mata di,i am a regular devotee here and visit this place every alternate year since 2002.and every time i come here i feel positively energized and refreshed.these blessings are worth the effort and much needed for every soul.
644,Abode of the goddesses,"Complete details to plan your trip .If your train is ending at Jammu Tawi station then you need to travel to the Karta railway station which takes around 2 hrs by train and 3 hrs by bus. Some trains go up to  the Katra railway station and  it's code is SVDK.First thing to do at the Katra Railway station is to do the registration for the darshan . This is a must, and this card is needed at most of the  places during the trip. This registration is done at the main building of the Katra railway station, just before the exit gate. To get this registration card every individual above the age of 10 is needed to stand in the queue for the photoshoot, with a Gov. recognised identity proof as proof of your address. Its free of cost.  You can also get this online using the site of Mata Vaishno devi shrine board.There are three places of importance. 1st Ardhkumari, 2nd Vaishno devi and the 3rd is KalVairav ji.Without going to the Kalvairav ji the holy trip is treated as incomplete.Distance to travel:-- From Katra to Ardh kumari is 6 Km , from Ardh kumari to Vaishno devi is 5.5 Km, from Vaishno devi to Kal vairav ji is 1.5 km. All the distances are authentic as per the records there. You also need to add 0.5 KM extra to come back from Vaishno devi to the trekking point of Kalvairav ji. There are 4 popular options to travel from Katra to Vaishno devi . 1st is Trekking 2nd is Horse (Pony)  3rd is Palki 4th is Helicopter. For Helicopter you need to do the prior booking which starts 60 days before but closes within few hrs. Booking can be done online using the site of Vaisnodevi shrine board. Both the options, (one-way and both ways) are available. Helicopter service is from Katra to Sanchichat (a place in-between ArdhKumari and Vaishno devi).From Sanchi chat to Vaishno devi is approx 1 km. If you choose helicopter for both sides, you will miss Ardhkumari definitely.Trekking and Pony/Palki service:- From Katra station to the starting point of the trip called Ban Ganga  is 4 Km. Cabs and three wheelers are the  only option for this.At Ban ganga checking point Binocular, arms, any type of smoking and tobacco products are not allowed to be carried further. Checking is done quite strictly.Palki and Pony are available at  Ban ganga.  If you want a horse or palki, always pay by prepaid mode to avoid any hassle there after. For carrying the kids/infant's there are two options 1st is Pithu (a person who carry on his back) 2nd is a 4 wheeler pram which is available on rent at the Ban ganga check post.Exact distance from Ban ganga which is the starting point of the journey to Ardhkumari is 6 km via the old route and 8.5 Km via the new route called the Terakota route. The Terakota route was inaugurated by PM in May 2018. This route is free of the pony but is 2.5 Km longer so very few people uses this. Some people avoid stopping at Ardh kumari and proceed to Vaishno devi directly . If you want to do the darshan of the holy cave of Ardh kumari you will have to do your booking again at Ardhkumar. A batch of 50 is made and is allowed to pass through the cave one by one. The cave is around 5 to 7 Mt long and 2 to 2.5 ft wide. Any man can pass through it easily but people who are extremely claustrophobic may avoid this. I am known as extremely claustrophobic so I avoided but my family did it very comfortably. You may do this in return journey also as this needs 5 to 6 hrs,so you can relax there and wait for your turn while returning.From Ardh kumari you need to travel to Vaishno devi this is 5.5 km and not that steep as is the trekking from Ban ganga to Ardh kumari. The effort needed here is comparatively lesser. Battery operated vehicles are also available but are very less in numbers so difficult to avail, better not to expect. Never expect to get a room or even a bed or a shade at Vaishno devi even in the off season. So if you want to stay there do the prior booking 60 days before. However sufficient stocks of blankets are available at Vaishno devi and also at Ardh kumari so no need to carry. It's free with 100 Rs/blanket as security money. On return journey from Vaishno devi you will be provided prasad and a small coin at the exit point of Vaishno devi.   It's free of cost.From Vaishno devi you need to travel back 0.5 Km to reach at the trekking point for Kalarav ji. why I say it's difficult, because it's much steeper than the journey of Ardh kumari to Vaishno devi and is almost like   Ban ganga to Ardh kumari or you can say its slightly more. For this you can use ropeways from Vaishno devi,but ropeways doesn't operate after the evening till morning. Ample place for fooding is available both at Ardh kumari and Vaishno devi including Sagar Ratna but not at Kal Vairav ji. On return from Ban ganga to Katra there is no option but to take a three wheeler  at a fixed rate of Rs 210 for 6 Km one way journey. I did this trekking for the third time at the age of 51along with my wife and two kids aged 14 and 9 Yrs so you can also do it. The toughest feeling is till Ardh kumari, if you can reach there you will definitely do the complete journey as you are there because the Goddess has called you. In case of any confusion you can WhatsApp me at 9990318745.""Jai Mata di"""
645,Holy pilgrimage ,Best religious place to visit for all Hindus. the devi is very popular and powerful and fulfills the wishes of Her devotees. Awesome nature beauty.
646,"Dirty, Commercial, Where's the spirituality?","Went to katra with friends. from there someone recommend to take new route to climb.  though route was much wide and clean but it was longest. so we will not recommend it .Please take the old route to save time. never take the stairs you will be exhausted soon.If you are planing to stay back there please don't do it. most of the hotels and inn are always full. better you track after 7 pm will reach after mid night. relax and freshen up, after that stand in the Que for darshan. After darshan hang around then get down u will be back by morning. Tip: After midnight there is less que for everything ex. darshan, locker, token. prasad."
647,Truly Divine Feeling you forget all worries  !!,"Mata vaishno devi is one of the india's most famous worship place, where each year million of pilgrims offer prayers to mata vaishno. Temple of mata vaishno devi is situated on trikuta parvat, where you can feel chilly breeze even in the month of may-june-july. The scenic beauty is really fascinating and charming. To reach the darbar(vaishno devi temple), you first need to reach the katra bus stand where you need to take passes without which you will not be allowed to offer prayer in bhawan. vaishno devi temple is nearly 14 kilometer from katra bus stand and you have to travel all this by foot. There are other options like pony, palki or pithu walas. But travelling by foot is considered more devotional. there are two ways from ardh-kumari to reach the temple, one by hathi matha and second by himkoti. there are auto service to reach sanjhi chhat(temple) from ardh kumari via himkoti way but by hathi matha you have to travel by foot, pony etc.  it is beleaved that the trip is incompelte without offering prayer to the bhairav in bhairav mandir which is 1.4 KM from darbar.  the main attraction is also the katra Railway station which is equipped with advanced technologies. it is well furnished and properly built."
648,Jay Mata di,"It's refreshing and revitalizing to visit VaishnoDevi. But, this time I felt the management is not taking care of place as before - the helicopter ride with advance booking was cancelled without notification. The staff at temple accommodations is not courteous and heli-services staff doesn't give proper answers to your inquiries. The pedestrian walk-way to Bhawan has too many pony's and cleaning staff is not able to keep up to it - it makes it difficult to walk and is crammed. The food services are average along the route now."
649,Do read for tips,"With no offence to the divine shrine of vaishno devi, the locals have made it a place of business, the official site is fooling the devotees by including very low budget hotels, we can use goibibo/MakeMyTrip for booking much better hotels in that range. For eg. Niharika hotel is very dirty with lizards and cockroaches etc. Secondly, the way up is super dirty, if the govt. can make helicopter facility to reach temple then why can't separate way for ponies and pedestrians. While walking up when you sit to take rest the people will trouble you to give you massage forcibly. The lockers have big ques. Its better not to carry anything at all. It's become a place for low class than middle or upper class as they are expected to be carrying enough money to pay 150 bucks for as long as 1 km for an auto ride. The people are shrewd and uncivilized to trouble you if you need any service. Other than the holy shrine which is indeed magical as inspite of journey from katra on foot which began at 9am and concluded at 9pm (back to katra after darshan) ,the muscle soarness and pain subsided the next morning!!!!,,, the people and govt. have made it a NO NO place."
650,Enjoyed,"well I had a wish to be there since my childhood.there is a saying that unless Mata ka bulawa one cannot reach there. got lucky last year in August when with Maa Papa n Wife went there to Darshan.Katra is now directly connected to Delhi via Train. in past the last train station was Jammutawi later extended till Udhampur and finally till Sri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra..One can book Yatra Parchi through Internet (free of cost) in advance.it will save your time. Banganga Gate is nearly 15-16kms. Auto available 24hr till Banganga Gate. from there Palkie Ride ,  Pony ride or through Walk .. you can't find a difference in Day and Night there as whole road is lightened at Night. the only avoidable time is rainy season due to the risk of landslides. One thing I have to mention here I've started the treck at 9:30am but if you have plan to treck in night last entry time is 11pm so you have to enter Banganga Gate before 11pm.As my parents are senior citizen so I stayed in Adhkuwari on first day in Shailputri Bhavan.Next day took pony ride till Sanjhi Chhat. Darshan gave us amazing peace of mind. Didn't able to go till Bhairo Baba Darshan as it's almost straight up treck from Mata Mandir and Maa wasn't in state to do another treck.. there is an option of Battery Car for senior citizens but surprisingly Papa n Maa decided to go down by walk. Reached Katra Station at 7pm (took our time) our train was at 11pm (Shree Shakti Exp) It was a memorable experience will go there again and again .. Jai Mata Di"
651,Hindu Pilgrimage,"Hello friends, the best time to climb the parvat is 11 at night. It is beneficial on both ways i.e. If you walk friskly you will reach temple before 5 am i.e. Before arti & if you walk slowly you will reach after arti i.e. You not need to wait outside as nobody is allowed during arti."
652,Divine Place,This is a one type of temple. It is a historical temple in the world. This temple famous for Jai matha Di. Historical temple and is here snow falls. Very cool temple and also it located in Trikuta hills.I must be visited temple for who loves nature.
653,The Legend of the Powerful Mother Goddess,Would like to go again to pay a visit to Mata Rani's Charan and hope she calls me as soon as possible
654,Holy Trip,"Was my second visit , Mesmerised , weather was cold , We tried for Helicopter ride but ut needs prior bookings , Hence last option was Horse Rise which took us 2 hrs to reach and another 2 hours to reach ground"
655,A good hiking trip for a religious purpose,Had great time in katra.Staff is very professional as we always look during hospitality services.Rooms are spacious and well maintained.Service is good.Special thanks to Mr.Sunny and his peers who really take care of all guest equally and give them info abt surroundings and darshan as most of the ppl visit for devi darshan.Over all its nice place to stay and close by from where darshan starts.
656,Jai Mata Di !!!,The resounding vibrations and abundant energy is what you take away from the Holi Shrine of Shri Mata Vaishnodevi MA. The stay arrangement and the organise way in which queues move for Darshan is amazing. Over the year there is improvement in facilities for al age groups. But plan n enjoy during week days. JMD
657,jai mata di!!,"The holy shrine of MA Vaishnodevi is managed by shrine board offering excellent facilities and services to visitors. The surrounding hills and nature is so encouraging that looks excellent particularly in the pre dawn and sun rise and sun set time. Every day there is a devotional Aarti in the morning and evening. The road from banganga the starting point till main bhavan is well constructed and coveted with shed to protect visitors from sunlight rain and rice throughout the year with full illumination of light through out. There are various ways of reaching from banganga as either one can walk take a horse ride or palaki - where 4 people carry an old person on their shoulders. Adkuwari is the mid point where one can Darshana and then proceed to main bhavan to salute mother. It is advisable to avoid the rush period if one wants to enjoy her holy Darshana else on an average 40-50000 people visit this place daily. There are many food joints , restaurants on the way with toilet and washing facility. The place is so well maintained that one really enjoys the visit. There are also facilities to stay in various places like kalika bhavan etc where one can book in advance and be a part of campus itself instead of staying outside in the lower levels in hotels and guest house. One must plan this visit minimum for two days except one wants to fly by helicopter and return same day. One of the best place in india worth a visit."
658,Jai Mata Di !!,This place has great vibes and is a must visit. The walk to the temple serves you with exotic city and nature views.
659,Soul refreshing,"This trip was great because I went with my friends first time...and best part was there that now every snacks franchises has been open there like CCD, dominos etc..so if anyone want to eat burger or pizza..they can. And one more best part was that weather in the march month."
660,Jai mata di ,"I was planning for this from last couple of years & finally made it this time.A lot of commercialisation have been done & one can avail the facilities of pony,palki ,Battery car or Prams if required .Though the trek is of 14 km almost but  due to the energy of the people & facilities provided by shrine board it's quite easy for the public.Only the thing i was expecting more channelised & proactive management at the bhawan  where people are waiting for hours & hours in the queues to get the slip /locker or blankets.My 6 yr old  kid have done trek on foot only... in return only he took pram for 2-3 km(from himkoti to ardhkumari)Mesmerised  by the almighty's creation & beauty."
661,Amazing trip from Katra to Vaishno Devi,They say you get to go only if maa invites you . She takes lot of exams and m sure if you go with faith she will except you as you are . It's a difficult trek of 12 kms You can walk down or take horse ride or take Palki which is basically 4 men lifting you on a doli kind Well I went walking cos I pity animals who bear so much weight of us n take us up and its inhuman to take doli I feel But it's their sole way of income so won't comment on both . Just for info horse ride charges are 3000 to 4000 return And palki charges are 5000 to 7000 It all depends on your weight and season and bargaining skills I wid suggest pay them whatever best cos it's a painful and very difficult job Was deeply saddened by seeing them struggle so much
662,One of the best pilgrimage in India,Jai mata diMay mata vaishno devi bless us all and always be with us in life foreverJai mata di....
663,Must visit religious place in India.,Here you can feel the God presence. See the area where you can definitely enjoy like tourist too. The temple is situated on a hill. The tourist have to walk up and down around 13 kms and you will not feel tried during the journey.
664,Religious place,"You can feel the devotional while traveling Hill top area 16KM walk or you will have other options like Mini Chopper, Horses, Man Tanga to Visit Matha Vaishno Devi Mandir. Through journey you will have the Food courts, helplines hospitals and other services too. Only Thing is Mobile Network service Poor that too Postpaid network works. You can enjoy the family trip of joy and near by other locations of Jammu."
665,Not for the faint hearted.,I liked to visit vaishnodevi. Thnxx TripAdvisor to give a best advice for this trip. I always now follow TripAdvisor for my next tripThank youuu.
666,Jai Mata di,"It was the most amazing trip to Mata's Darshan, full of energy, comfortable journey as we availed porters for our small kids and took helicopter while coming back."
667,Jai Mata Di,"As we need divine calling to have darshan of mata, the experience is exihilarating! feeling immensely happy to have had the heart felt darshan. we took a helicopter to-fro tkt . As we had to complete our darshan with in 3hrs. our co-passenger in the chopper advised us to hire a pony to complete mata and bhaironath in the permitted time which we think is a divine calling.But for the pony wala we would not have made it. we had to entrust our belonging with him(a guide who accompanied us).  till we returned. I  really dont know how we did that,we were so desperate to go have our darshan..we never had second thoughts. Everything was safe. The bitter experience was: there was a conflict between 2 pony walas about whose tur it is..so my daughter was caught in their tussle. we couldnt run to her help as we were on our pony and could not get down without any of their help. similarly they sucked out every last penny we had when we returned they charged a lot more than what we were told(750 per head for 3 legs-helipad-mata-bhaironath-helipad). they did not leave us till we were left with no money at all."
668,Jai Mata di,"Traveled here after almost 15 years and see things have improved a lot. The new path to trek is amazing, wide, clean of ponies (their litter) and beautiful views. There are several tea/coffee/snack kiosks all along the way. Feb would be the best month in my opinion, weather is the best at this time, not much crowd and hence you get to have your darshans in the original cave."
669,Jai Mata di,"I visited two times here. First time I didn't get rush but second time it was very crowd. We started our trek about 2 pm and reached there at 6:30 pm but we got darshan at 11:30 pm in night. I have waited and stayed in long queue. In night temperature was -7 degree, my legs were jammed because I have submitted my shoes, phone and all luggage in locker and stand in queue with only shocks. But after Darshan, I felt relax and divine. Trek for bhawan is good, enjoyed every moments. In middle of trek, we also got snowfall. After bhawan I head to Bhairo Baba temple, this trek is very steep. I reached there within 1.5 hour but it was very tough."
670,"""Bhawan - the ultimate Darbaar of Mata Rani""",Awesome place...feeling blessed. You can feel the blessings in the air. Jai Mata Di. Shrine Board can make improvements in terms of quality of washrooms. Food is gud in Sagar ratna and Devi food court at Bhawan.. Jai Mata Di
671,Divine experience,Go to the temple by walk as it is more adventurous and at night is preferable as it will not make you tired. The horse people will may cheat you so be careful while dealing with them
672,Jai Mata Di...,The aerial ropeway from the Bhawan to Bhairon ji mandir is fully operational. The operating times are 9 am to 5 pm. Rush is less when less persons visit the shrine and gets large when there is more crowd. Waiting time can be about 1/2 hour. Charges are RS 100 for one round trip and the trolley takes about 2 minutes to reach the top. It is truly an engineering marvel as the ropeway is at an angle of more than 60 degrees.
673,Mata ne Bulaya Hai!,"Wow its was a great experience. To go there can be done only by walk or horse ride. New path had build with shelter up.many things were selling on the way to go there. Like tea water indian snack samosa pakora and veg cakes. Have to walk 15 km to go up for prayer. Camera cannot be used. The people chanted jai mata di on the way. The old , kids and young peoples came from severals places or country to go to give darshan of the goddess mata vaishno devi which is one of the sister of Durga maa. The mata vaishno devi is in a cave and have the bhairo also. Its very beautiful. For taking horse tariff is 800 or 1000 rupee for one way. Security tough up.no camera water leather objects to be taken with is to go to do darshan of goddess.we have to put in a locker. Long queue to go to do prayer. If they could provide more easy facilities to go up would be easy for the one who cannot walk all the long km. Like cable car , a way for car to go up. Provide transport facilities to go up easily to do the prayer without any difficulties. We had gone gone there by walk and return on horse.we had never done such experience  . Was good we enjoy but too much  tired also."
674,Holy Divinity of Atka Aarti,Jai Mata Vaishno Devi is Greatest Sakti all over the country. Mata Vaishno Mahima is known to every one. Must visit for everyone who need Mental Peace and get rid of all the Problem. Mata Vaishno will Solve your Problem.
675,Awesome experience ,Jai Mata Vaishno Devi is Greatest Sakti all over the country. Mata Vaishno Mahima is known to every one. Must visit for everyone who need Mental Peace and get rid of all the Problem. Mata Vaishno will Solve your Problem.
676,Holy Shrine,Beautiful and Blissful.Very Happy to go for darshan.Would recommend everyone to go and feel the power of Godess around you and get her blessings for your family.
677,Holy Shrine,Please avoid new way to Ardh Kuwari.  It is very long way and you will not find anything.  It was boring.
678,Divine! Feeling blessed!,Its a very spirituals atmosphere over there because of the place is One of the most Divine place on Earth. Which you never forget after get Darshan. Prem Se Bolo Jai Mata Di....
679,Jai Mata Di,"Her darshan itself solves all problems.Plan everything in advance(hotels,travels etc).prepare for the long trecking"
680,JMD,One of the holiest Shrine of Hindus. Lucky to get blessed with the tranquility of Maa Vaishnodevi this Holi.
681,How to reach bhawan,"ja mata diHotel staff staff give best and help tipes use in journy timei hope you see really beauty of nature,nice city viewja mata di"
682,Vaishno Devi visit,"Strongly Recommend walking up from Banganga- you could take multiple stops en route and reach in 6 to 7 hrs.Water,food are available enroute. Take a 500 Ml empty bottle which you could refill enroute and carry less change clothes.Keeping your bag,leather goods and mobile in cloak room could take multiple hours if you end up at the wrong time.Easier method would be to buy Prasad at the shops at Bhawan location and they will provide you with a space to keep your material.Take the free Yatra prachi from Katra,get it stamped at the first security @ Banganga and you are done. On the way back you could walk in the new route upto Ardhkuwari ( same way to the top) and get a pony if you need. It would be easier to walk back if you take rest on top after Darshan.Pony rates could be double of what is recomended.you can walk up and down 24hrs in the well lit ,paved footpath and Autos will drop you to your hotel at Katra anytime."
683,"chalo bulava aya hai, mata ne bhulaya hai","Its a Devotional Visit... and we have been long planning to visit. But one needs to be mentally and physically prepared to make hike, it isn't an easy one! esp. with children under 10yrs of age.The walk was tough but the first 3-4 kms with shops on both sides can really be better if it doesn't smell of horse dung and urine. Being covered with a roof, the smell doesn't escape and hits your nose pretty hard. I really wish the way for horse/pony was different and not mixed with the walkers. After Adh-Kunvari the road splits into two ways, we took left hathi matha as the horses don‚Äôt go that way and it‚Äôs a alot cleaner and hygienic that side. Its one kilometer short as well.We visited on a pretty busy night, started hike at 9:30 PM at night and being with a child and old age parent, had to take intermittent stops to avoid fatigue. Don't be a macho and don't try to exhaust the energy way too fast, instead conserve your energy. It‚Äôs really not a matter of ""Strength"" rather its about stamina. don't forget you have to come back all the way down as well... which isn't easy as you think.We had Army Passes which saved out 2-3 hours from the regular visitor's queue, else its a real tough affair standing in queue after a hike of 6-8 hours on foot.Their were no English toilets that I could spot (though I'm told they do exists) and the Squat toilets were smelly and unclean as per civilized ""city"" standards. The Cafeterias run by Shrine board are excellent and value for money. Rajma(beans) Rice and Kadi Chawal were yummy, as was Idli and Wada. Tea and coffee are offered in good quantity and taste good.Reaching to the top towards the Bhawan there were massive lines and a bit of chaos as there are all classes of people visiting, some are really rude (ironically) and all they care about is their own visit. A lot of people take free blankets and just lie down to sleep on the grounds blocking visitors path.The visit to actual ""bhawan"" was an effort in itself too, and being a busy day, everyone was just given a few seconds to watch the ""pindi's"". but I think the for the volume of people visiting, this cannot be helped.Though I don't want to hurt religious sentiments, I still would like to warn people with younger children, esp. under 10 that its a very hard trip for them to bear. We saw children in absolute discomfort going up and down as they are in fatigue. So please consider this and prepare them mentally if you must take them.My Mother took a ‚ÄòPalaki‚Äô (Palanquin) which is carried by 4 people. From ban-ganga to Adh-Kuvari it was around Rs. 3000 and the same price while coming down. So it can be a bit expensive for those who need it. Horse may be a cheaper (and Faster) option but then you need to be comfortable (and confident) sitting on it, though I personally found them safe. Still, the real testimony is travelling both ways on foot which really gives you a sense of accomplishment.Anways‚Ä¶ its not a tourist visit rather an act of religious accomplishment so be prepared mentally and physically. Wear good shoes, esp. the ladies. May Ma Vaishno fulfil your Yatra. Jai Mata Di"
684,Jai mata di,"The temple is situated atop the mountain and is a 12km walk away from the entrance. You can hire horses for Rs 1200 to take you to the top or just go the old foot and stick way but there's no way in heaven you're reaching the top in less than 4 hours cause of the incline. There are shops over the first half of the walk and the second half through Ardhakuwari also has a few. When you reach the half point - take the 5.5 km walk it's gotta more gentle slope and better roads. Pro tip - Don't wait in line for the cloak room, buy some prasad at the shop and he'll keep your luggage."
685,Must visit this place in your life,Well best place to be u can take chopper service @ 1175 or horse @700 one way..battery car after Adhkuwari @300/PP.. By walk u can enjoy scenic  beauty. No words for JMD Bhawan and Managements
686,Vaishno Devi Trip,"Holy place. One of the few holy places where people do not ask money. Had good Darshan, no one pushed us away."
687,Vaishno Devi - in February,"We walked around the most beautiful mountain with some amazing friends. We had our inhibitions about hiring a pithoo but realised how amazing that little push and support on the back can be. On curves which were steep and moments when we were tired to move even a step further the pithoo""s support on our lower back was God sent. Happy and chirpy guys who are always willing to help.We got the most amazing weather as it was nice and cold with no sun at all. The temple is beautiful and serene. Nestled in a cave its the most beautiful and peaceful temple. Got the most amazing darshan as there was no crowd at all. In fact we were lucky to go through the cave to get to the temple which is closed on most occasions. On the way down we had to make a run to reach the helipad. The helicopter ride was fantastic and we got the most amazing view of the mountains.  Its an experience of a life time and a must do for all."
688,Ideal time to visit Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine,"This Holy Place in north India Mata Vaishno Devi, also known as Mata Rani, Trikuta and Vaishnavi, is a manifestation of the Hindu Mother Goddess Mahalakshmi. Temple / Holy Shrine is located on Trikuta mountain Can be reach by Helicopter service up to Shanjichhat and than walk from there or take horse ride. or can be reach Cave after walking or by horse ride of 15 Km.from base camp of Katra. We took helicopter ride on weekend and were  given VIP passes for express darshan  still it took almost more than two hours. Avoid to visit on weekends.On week days you can have more time in the cave for darshan."
689,Jai Matadi,"It is most amazing and divine place. You can feel the spirituality on everywhere even on air with the sound of ""Jai Mata Di"". It is a perfect place for piece of mind as well as enjoy the nature beauty."
690,Must go...,"The temple does have strong history for seven hundred years. But there's some historical underlings found in Ramayana idigash, where Arjuna mentioning the goddess. But the pilgrims are visiting here most and this is the second place in the world as most visited place. Nice place to get divine bless from Goddess."

Very senic all around, grt view to Katra valley nice weather and Maa Vaisno devi.Poorly managed around, overcrowed, difficult for first time visitor. Rains make it worst and difficult to be with kids."
692,Celestial Divine Worship Place Vaishni Devi,you cannot describe a divine place in words..a great place for religious people with a positive vibes all around..worth the pain taken to climb up to the temple..weaker legs can take a helicopter ride/ ponny etc to the temple..
693,"Can't describe in words the ""DIVINE"" experience","The walk from the base to the Mata's darshan is not for the faint-hearted. It takes quite an effort to get the darshan but it is well worth it. The sense of achievement and a feeling of peaceful joy of completing the complete journey to and from the Devi Maa's shrine on foot is really something.If you really want to experience the essence of this journey, despite all the pain it may cause, I recommend doing it on foot.We started the trek to the shrine at about 9:00 pm. The route is well paved and most of the route is now covered. The route is also well secured with railings all along the way.That was one of the lean periods of the day so the number of people walking up with us were relatively less. Its an very nice atmosphere - people chanting ""Jai Mata Di"", offering muted prayers and walking up the slope to reach the Devi Maa's shrine for the darshan.We (me, my wife, and sons aged 15 and 10) completed the walk up to the shrine well in time for the darshan. We completed our darshan at 3:00 am. We spent a while to recuperate a bit from the paining legs started our walk back to the base at around 4:30 am. It seems like an almost unending walk to the shrine and back to the base but we made it back by about 8:45am. We thought the walk up to the shrine will be difficult, but it was the trek back from the shrine that was more exhausting.There are facilities like the ride to the top by helicopter (from a cost perspective this is not very expensive) or doli (4 people carrying you almost all the way to the shrine), horse rides (you ride a horse / mule with an attendant accompanying you on foot). I know it helps them earn a living but in my opinion it is cruel to make other people and animals carry you up and down the sloping roads. The effort that has to go into it is enormous.Kudos to all the people who do this darshan yatra on foot on a regular basis.Jai Mata Di!!"
694,J Hotel - Port Blair,Jai Mata Di !!!! Awesome feeling @ Cave. Reach either by 13 KM track or by by Helicopter ride & 2.5 km track
695,Very Divine And Famous Temple,"Vaishno Devi Mandir is a very popular Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu Goddess, she is the incarnation of Durga mata, located at the Trikuta Mountains. The journey to the Holy Shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi is an enchanting journey of the places where Mata Vaishnavi had spent some time while observing various spiritual disciplines and penances. The culmination of this journey is at the Holy Cave where she merged her human form with the astral form of her creators, the three Supreme Energies.The journey to the Holy Shrine of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Ji starts with the Call of Mata.It is very difficult to express in words how you feel being one of the thousands of devotees to offer prayers and seek blessings of mata rani in the holy cave. The distance is around 12 KMs from Banganga and there are many options available to make the journey feasible for every age group.The whole area is covered with several restaurants and rest rooms throughout the track.The track is getting continuously renovated to make yatra more comfortable to devotees. A lot of focus is on cleanliness of the Trikuta hill and the safety of the devotees.If you are travelling on foot, from Adhkuwari you can take the new track which is less steep and thus easy to walk.Jai Mata Di !"
696,Spiritual Trip,"A very holy experience. Once must visit at least in a lifetime. I am a born Hindu and was so glad to see cultural/ religious diversity here. All horseriders, horse owners, pitthus (guys who will carry your weight, small babies) were Muslims. I felt so much of gratitude that for a small sum of money we get so much of help from people around. And there is no Hindu, no Muslim,. all religions are first human beings who support humanity first. This is incredible. Matas Darshan also fills you with so much of fresh energy and spirituality. We had walked and trekked all the way. Do take new route which is easy."
697,Darbaar of Maa,I feel priveledged to share that in april and july i had back to back bulawa's of mata rani ji üòç. Felt happy and contented to be here. Hope mata rani listens to our prayers üòäüòä. Jai mata di. I will surely visit again ‚ò∫
698,Undescriable,It is a challenge and a satisfaction of reaching the Shrine. Give positive energy to the mind and body. Jai Mata Di
699,Awesome,Awesome journey.It was a wonderful experience.Doing Chants of Jai Mata di in whole journey was a epic experience. Whole fatigue gone off once we reached Bhavan and the view from journey is a treat to watch.
700,Jai mata di,"To reach the temple, you have about 14 kms of trek, which you can travel by walk or on a horse or on other people ;). The other way is to travel via Chopper to Sanjhichatt Helipad and after that have about 6 kms of trek left. There are a lot of food joints on the way, you will not feel tired at all. JAI MATA DI !!"
701,Divine experience,beautiful walk if a little tiring. good facilities and very well maintained by the shrine Board. Choose non festive days to really enjoy the trek and the hassle free darshan.
702,Must Visit Place,We have been in the month of Aug'16. Fully rainy weather. Started at night and have full rain throughout way to Maa Vaishno Devi Bhawan. But it was awesome and early morning during aarti time we reached maa temple (cave). Attended entire aarti of 1 hr approx. It was great experience for our whole family.
703,Most Amazing DIVINE Place,i loved this place no words for this people plz visit there and take self experince i only say jai mata di
704,Divine,"we  went on the helicopter took a 9 am flight and were back by 12:30 everything went like clock work ,by taking the helicopter you get VIP privilege's resulting in no lines to get in and is place to put your things in locker"
705,This is Good ,"whenever you visit Ma Vaishno devi shrine for darshan, ensure that you reach the Bhawan well before 6.00 pm. At 6.00 pm, the darshans are closed for 2 hours as it is Aarti and pooja time. Darshans resume at 8.00 pm again. So plan your visit accordingly. Battery operated cars are available at Ardhkumari for those who are senior citizens or aged or handicapped. only a few seats are available and battery car seat seekers are rushing for them. The car takes half an hour to reach Bhawan anddrops you at Manokamna bhawan. Charges are Rs. 300 per seat. For return journey by battery car, tickets are available up to 6.00 pm only at Bhawan window and charges are Rs. 200 per seat. There is helicopter seat window By Himalaya travels at Bhawan, near Locker no. 23. Charges are Rs. 1100 or so per seat for travel from Bhawan to Katra. You may book helicopter seats here. Prices keep varyig as per season and rush. Take food at pure veg restaurant Sagar Ratna. Good food reasonable price."
706,Beautiful temple nestled in the mountains,JAI MATA DIHoly Shrines in North India with the name of Maa Vaishno Devi. During summer travel at Night time and during winter go for Darshan at Day time and get your wishes and desires fulfilled by Maa Bhagwati.
707,One of the Divine & holy place in India,Origin of Vaishno Devi is as mysterious as it is about several other Shrines from the past era. That is why it still remains difficult to find out exact date from when the Holy Shrine pilgrimage might begin. In fact a geological investigation and research of the Holy Cave has calculated that approximately one million years is the time frame since when pilgrimage continues. Vedic History of Vaishno Devi explains that there was no presence of female worshippers in the past while Rigveda found their presence in the mountain Trikuta. It especially focuses upon Shakti worship practice that continues since Puranic
708,Very famous temple ,February is the perfect month for darshan in my opinion. Beautiful surroundings and less crowd. Hotels are cheaper than in other months.
709,Pune/Mumbai -Amritsar-Katra-Vaishnodevi itinerary,"We (me and my friend) have started our journey from New delhi by Shri Shakti Express at 17:35 hours on Saturday, We arrived SVDK station at Sunday 5:10 hours, The same moment we walk till ban ganga and after crossing the gate we took ponny service @380 Rupees till Ardhkuwari. It took around 1 hour to reach Ardhkuwari by 7:15 Hours on sunday we were at Ardhkuwari, Then we walked till Bahawan and reached by 9:15 hours on Sunday morning, Before 2 months we have booked Manokamna Bhawan Dormitory so we checked in there at around 10:00 hours. Took Bath and then went for Mangal Darshan of Maa Jagdamba. There was no rush no que, we took 10 minutes to take darshan and came out from there. We took our breakfast after darshan at Shrine Board Cafeteria and then decided to take small rest at Dormitory. Again we started our journey from Bhawan to Bhairo baba at 15:00 hours from Bhawan. After Darshan at Bhairon we started our journey to Katra via ardhkuwari at 16:00 Hours. It took 2 hours on foot to reach ardhkuwari from Bhairo baba. Then around 8:30 we reached to Katra.  Took Some meals and then walked to Train Station. The train was at 23:05 hours from SVDK and reach Delhi on Monday 10:35 hours."
710,Divine ,most blessed trip start to end. everything went very smoothly right from the horse ride to the darshan and helicopter ride back to katra. The road to the temple is well developed with railings and grill at the sides. The road to the top is execellent and we reached in 3 hours on horse back.Since we went in the night we got beautiful darshan and felt very blessed as we could spend maximum time at the mandir. We also heard the aarti and visited bhairavnath temple.
711,One of the best place to visit at least once in lifetime,Its an awesome trip awesome place and really good services available..hotels .. people .. facilities etc all are really good .. helicopter at a affordable prices.. even horses etc.. Must visit once..
712,Excellent - Seek blessings of Maa Vaishno,"Visiting this temple is true enlightenment in one's life. One does not make it to the top unless Maata (The Holy Goddess) has not called you. This temple is located in Katra, for which the nearest entry point is Jammu. It is a 2 hr road journey from there. To enter the temple you will need a visitor card which can be printed online or taken from the temple office which is in town. The way to the temple is a 14-15 km uphill walk from the starting point. Depending on your fitness level it can take about 6 hrs or more uphill. There is an option to go horseback, in a palanquin or by helicopter(you have to plan in advance for this mode of travel) too if you're not fully upto it. It is best to start this journey in the evening by around 8 pm. There are two roads leading to the top. Once you reach the halfway mark which is called Ardqari, you need to chose between the new path (it is a km and half shorter) or the old one. On our first visit we missed the new path completely, so it was quite a walk as the old track is steep. There are lot of places to hydrate yourself and take a break during your trek. You will also meet a lot of inconsiderate people along the way who will be sleeping on the benches which are meant for people to take a breather which is very sad. Once you make it to the top you need to deposit your shoes, belt, phone, etc in a locker as they are not allowed in the Holy Shrine. You need to make it into the main temple before 5 am as the Temple will close for Aarti (Holy Prayers) from 5:00 - 8:30 am. The new batch will only be allowed after that so you will have to wait all that while if you miss. Once you are in you will get your blessings and those precious minutes with Maata that you toiled for. The way back down is slightly easier but long too. My best advice is to wear light clothes and leave other assets (phone, wallet, etc) in your hotel as getting a locker upstairs can also be a challenge during peak season. Plastic bags, raincoats are mentioned not to be carried along. Carry loose cash for your refreshment and other needs. Horseback carriers will never go according to published rates, so negotiate carefully. It is best to visit this temple from November till February as it will not be so crowded and there is a special tunnel path which is open during the winter only. May and June are difficult months as it is extremely crowded. Avoid public holidays too. Be Blessed!"
713,Jai Mata Di - Jus be der,"We went there in March this year and it was a satisfying and most divine trip.. when u reach the Bhawan ie the sanctum sanctorum after hours or arduous journey or by any other means like a helicopter till Sanjhi Chhat the experience when u reach ur destination is mesmerising and overwhelming.. nestled in a cave on top of a mountain the place is a sheer dip in divinity and reverence.. with so many facilities like helicopter, battery operated transport till half way, pinoes and porters the Yatra has become much more comfortable and easier than before..kudos to the shrine board for effective management.. leaving aside the arrangements the sheer bliss of completing the Yatra and Darshan of Mata Vaishno Devi is in itself a most fulfilling and satisfying experience one can ever have.. A must visit place in lifetime.."
714,Memorable Trip ,Whenever I went there ; I felt enlightened and more religious .. my belief in the almighty became all the more stronger.
715,Family,"Is there any local agent who can do helicopter booking for 4 adults in advance and is authorized person for booking helicopter for darshan, as we are traveling for katra on 23rd Dec reaching at 5.10am on katra station. Can u provide some contacts to do booking of helicopter and rooms in shrine board"
716,First visit to Vaishnodevi,"We had booked the helicopter for our trip almost 3 months ago. We were lucky to get the flight to the top. The return flight was cancelled because of bad weather and we had to walk 13 kms down. The walkway is almost entirely covered and paved. There are several restrooms, stalls and help centres along the way. The path is quite clean except for horse dung. The track for pedestrians and horses is the same, which is a bit risky. The cave temple is well illuminated, clean and well managed. The official website has all the information and is easy to use."
717,Holy pilgrimage,"Rudest people on earth, The Staff and taxi drivers are the worst, Every body has no respect to the pilgrims, all staff deployed shrine board behave with a super attitude.i have travelled most tourist spot of the world but this is worst. Board is trying to its best bet staff is not cooperating, the Muslim staff is very rude they should not be there as no hindus are allowed in Muslim pilgrimages.thanks."
718,Not able to describe this place,"Devotional place in north India, 25km of steep mountain climbing thru foot, options are available like horse, helicopter.People with breathing issue should restrain from going there during winter season as the oxygen level reduces significantly."
719,Jai Mata Di,This is the most holy place that makes me so emotional and touchy. I had been to maa ka darbar several times in the past and I feel like I should be their every few days. It is such place were wish is fulfill by Maa.
720,DIVINE,A holy place with too much faith it is must to visit in your life. By walking it is comfortable. Every point drinking water and food facility and washrooms are available. Locker are also available. It is only the temple which remains open for 24 hrs.
721,Out of the world experience,"Ofcourse, its not my first trip but every time i see new addition for Pilgrimage. Many facilities for pilgrimars from shrine boards. Even than rush is keep on increasing day by day. Sp. Good rooms by shrine board Gauri bhavan, are comfortable. Location is amazing. Surrounded by pine trees its abliss to stay overnight there. Pre booking is most imp part."
722,Vaishno Devi yatra,"Most secured pilgrimage.Had been visiting since 25 years.No Army men was seen entire.Once you enter through Banana Route,you are totally safe and secure.No need to carry weight,everything is available entire.Housekeeping and sanitation is world class.All community bathrooms are fitted with Jaguar fittings.Waiting time is seasonal.At Adhkumari be prepared for long wait.Cafe Coffee Day serves refreshing Brew at this altitude.Battery operated Auto is available from Adhkumari upto Bhavan.Ponywalas are creating nonsense these days."
723,Vaishno Devi Yatra,"First of all I am an atheist person, still this place made me fall in love with. walking to the top of Trikuta mountain the whole night with chilling winds, and other pilgrim's joy and stamina will surely make you feel great and blessed to be there. After a long and exhausting upwalk for almost 6 hours, you will get rest seeing the beautiful temple complex and the gathering of many people. You can stay the night there or just come back after giving your PUJA and taking your Prasad. Then there's another downwalk for 5-6 hours back to Katra. Oh! yes you can hire Pitthus, Palkis, Ghoras(Horse) and Chopper and diesel car service at daytime. But they remain close at night. There's many Bhojnalayas(Hotels for fooding) in the way to temple if you feel hungry. And the food is very tasty and cheap... I can't share any photos as camera, mobile or any leather or electronics goods are not allowed there.:-("
724,Jai Mata Di,"If planned perfectly...this would be a most memorable trip. Walking 12kms with young kids and family would be fun. However, with elders it's suggested to go with üèá or sedan chair. Better not to carry any luggage. You will find snacks, food, water for every kilometer."
725,Vaishno mata visit,Helicopter services to Sanjichat have made this holy shrine very accessible to all. A must visit on the piligrimage itinerary in India.
726,Temple,We brought return helicopters ticket for our darshan. Our printed time was 11.11 onwards and 14:44 return.   We reached at 10:15. first counter verified our documents. Then we went to boarding counter where they assigned a boarding number and provided priority darshan pass. At 11:30 one small van took us to heli pad. There after another round of ID verification and baggage checking we got our turn at 12:30. As it was 80 minutes late they allowed one hour extra in our return timing. On arrival counter they provided gatepass for gate no 5. Walking till gate 5 is easy. We had to keep all camera mobile leather items in counter 4. It took almost one hour in queue and they allowed only couple of seconds for darshan. Return journey till heli pad needs little extra effort as we need to climb few stairs.
727,A historic and religious place!! JAI MATA DI,While we were booked by the copter because of bad weather we had to take the walking route but it was a fantastic experience . The evening Arati was spectacular and truly worth the climb
728,JAI MATA DI,"It is a very devotional temple, however, a lot of things left to be desired for its management. Although it has come a long way, however, there is still lot of scope for improvement. The battery cars that have been started - the ticket booking counters open only for few hours and are then closed for hours at a stretch. The washrooms are dirty to say the least. The crowds must be managed in a better way, particularly in peak seasons"
729,Must Visit once in a life time.,We had a very good experience. We used helicopter services so the whole darshan took very less time including family. Everything is very well organised. Kusdos to the shrine board to manage it so well despite the huge crowd visiting the temple everyday.
730,Wonderful experience and very comfortable journey,"As it is a highly religious place, I cant say more than adding that Mata Vaishno Devi does listen to whole hearted prayers."
731,Surreal Experience,I travelled with my husband and 11 year old son. We all had an amazing experience as we walked the whole thing. I would like to do it again if my fitness level prevails. Walking that much is quite tiring.
732,wonderful of nature view,jai mata di...its was a nice experience for me and my family. its soo beautiful and sooo chilling cold out there. walking was really diificult but we managed it.the is vehicle services.
733,Nature of life,Nice place and we had a great Darshan here.....  Would be happy to visit again to this holy place Jai  mata  di
734,Awestruck delight!!!,i was stunnedto seethecave temple which was the  previous Altar place  and now the  current temple is also really good which is housed in a cave very well and neatly maintained and orderlya darshan arranged.though the crowed is surging always it is well maintained and the pilgrims have no difficult in having good and easy darshan excepting the wait in the queue.only problem is the helicopter tkt. iot is now available 2 months in advance on line and dit should be made avaiable on spot which will go a long way in helping pilgrims who could not plan inadvance. certainly the horse  is difficultone with risk. so better and good and more arrangement of jhelicopter is the need of the hour. itis a mutfor everyone to visit this atleast once
735,Visit no one can ignore it's worth more than other places ,Visited this place in end of January 2019 with my friends. Nice cold climate even it rained and snowed while walking to Ma Vaishno Devi Temple from Katra. . Then I walked from Temple to Bhairav Baba Temple which is situated further up. Photo I shared with this review was taken of MA Vaishno Devi Temple from Bhairav Baba in late evening. It was looking beautiful.
736,Ma Vaishno devi Darsan ,Very Nice  and enjoyed more.My Father 75 years age old visited with me.They also enjoyed atmospherJai Mata Di Awesome place for the Darshan of Mata Rani.
737,Jai Mata Di - along with Sacred Darshan experienced the first snowfall of my life,"This popular pilgrimage spot, in a Holy Cave located in the folds Trikuta (three peaked mountain), at an altitude of 5200 ft, this Holy Shrine is considered to be one of the holiest pilgrimages. Shri Mata Vaishno Devi resides in the holy cave that attracts millions of devotees annually. shows immense faith among devotees who throng the Shrine from all parts of India/abroad.It's a trek for Yatris of nearly 12-14 kms from the base camp at Katra to Bhawan to be blessed with the Darshans of Mata. These Darshans are of three natural rock formations called Pindies & there are no idols inside the Cave. The way to trek up is either by steps or routes slopes created by the Mata Trust, which is maintained very neat and clean. Good Amenities, restaurants are available through the trek journey. Yatri'c can choose to Walk up or by Helicopter (requires advance booking), use Horse backs, Pittus (that carry in a palanquin), or through Electric car (Requires ticket booking at Bhawan and only issued few numbers in a day) from Ardh Quarry (mid way). The whole journey is made possible & easy by holy chants of 'Jai Mata Di' chanted with many variations in praise of Mata by pilgrims, Rest Areas/Shelters and Restaurants , drinking spots along most part of the route.Book Horse to & Fro; getting it one way may be a big task with more demands from operators. Pilgrims/Yatris can use lockers at the Bhawan to keep you belongings as no items like bags ( except prasad bags), camera's mobile or purse are not allowed inside the shrine. One can also book Aarti Darshan if you are big donor or purchase Aarti tickets.Bairon Mandir is a slight deviation from Ardh Quarry. Pilgrims can opt to do both Mata Mandir /at Bhawan & Bairon Mandir visit together or do only Mata!. It's considered more auspicious to do both !Darshans are open round the clock throughout the year. It can be very cold during winters. More crowded during Nav Ratra festivals and you may have to wait in long queues.Before being able to climb/trek way up, yatri's need to take entry coupons after registering at the Registration counter in Katra at base of the hill.Remember to carry government recognized  ID's to present at this counter.While it's possible to do Up & Down the mountain the same day, you have to plan it well to take some rest between ascend & descend. Or take rooks in hotels at Bhawan and do it at ones ability, leisure and convenience."
738,Vaishno Devi 02,"Recently visited above shrine.Some points to note(1) book yatra parchi online through there website to save time.(2) from katra railway station to Ban ganga the auto rate was published 105 (but no auto wala was ready to go there for less then 200 rupees.(3) don't carry backpack etc on your own better to hire Potter for the same.(4) To keep mobile phone etc in the locker choose the one which is near manokamna bhawan  (on left side) . And don't go for the locker room which is little downward .(5) Sagar ratan restaurant is at the Bhavan , and also at adh kwari.. it serve very tasty food and both the joints.(6) the new all paved road has still not being opened for general public.(7) from ban ganga to bhawan to whole area was spick and span with regular cleaning going on.Overall a very divine destination."
739,Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Visit,"This time when I visited this place with my family the weather gone to be awesome.there is a rainfall when we reached at the top of the mountain.there is   a ""bhairavnath"" temple.after visiting there your ""Darshan"" get completed.its take to 10-12 hour to complete whole darshan"
740,superb experience,I am really grateful to God that he blessed me with a chance to go to the this most beautiful and holy sacred place. It is a heaven in itself...
741,Awesome,It is so difficult to express the divine experience of coming here. One can only experience it. I started coming here to experience this since 1998 and stopped counting the number of time I visited here.
742,Holy Place,Jai Mata di. Come and immerse yourself in an ocean of spirituality and seek blessings to get rid of all obstacles in your life.
743,Holy and Scenic,Trip was so awesome and weather was also fantastic....... and this hotel has good facility for pick and drop and Yatra ticket
744,Awesome Experience ,"If pilgrims in India are to be classified, the prominent classification would be - the ones who have had darshan of  Vaishno Devi and the others who have not. The reach to the temple, the darshan methodology, the Harathi of the evenings and mornings add  bliss to the devotees in a measure that is beyond human imagination. The temple is on a hillock at approximately 8 km from Katra Railway Station. If J & K is reminiscent with fear gripping the nerves, the Maa Vaishno Devi Katra railway station that opens the road to temple dispels the opinion and delivers the awe and inspiration every pilgrim needs in the quest to worship the Devi. A railway station that is very neat, beautifully floored, well lit lends no fear in the minds all the 24 hours of the day. Before going it is advisable to book hotel accommodation in Katra. There is no dearth of hotels but preferred mode would be to have the confirmation in advance. Be it any hotel, pilgrims have to commute on local autos / taxis from station to hotel which at max will be 5 kM. Local transport is not very costly and drivers are not demanding either. Notable aspect is everyone in this temple town regards work as worship. After a refresh, pilgrims have to start the next leg on their road to Temple top. Following multiple options is available1. Totally on foot if possible - approx 7 kM in a terrain that is a combination of ramp and steps. Estimated time to get to top is 3 hrs for every moderately able bodied person. 2. Hire a Pony (Horse). Here the pilgrim sits on the horse and is guided by the Horseman for a fee. While this mode is a fun for many, not advisable for women above 40 as it gives back ache. 3. Hire a Palki. - Here the pilgrim sits in a palki and is carried by four men, two in the front and two at rear. This too is chargeable. Safe and funny4. Fly by helicopter upto a certain distance. The flying time is 7 minutes. Tickets can be booked in advance or else can also be booked after reaching Katra. Sl no 1 to 3 can be tried anytime during the 24 hrs. No reason to panic or fear of theft/threat as the terrain is well illuminated and crowd is considerable. Sl no 4 is available only between 7 am to 6 pm. In winter, it is for further reduced duration. Even if one takes Helicopter, a final stretch of approx 2 km will have to be on foot/palki/pony as described above.Darshan of Mata ji is available for 24 hrs except for a brief 2 hrs in the dead of the night. The Pittus/Palki bearers/Horsemen are illiterates from the border districts of J & K viz. Rajouri/Baramulla/Kupwara. With no means for earning available in their native place, these kashmiri muslims eke out a living through this menial yet virtuous job. Notwithstanding  their religion, people thronging Vaishnodevi for darshan / earning chant Jai Mata Ji. The Mata has delivered and continues to bless all who come and worships her. Once on top of the hillock, pilgrims have to go in a queue through a route that is again a combination of steps and ramp. Finally a walk through a tunnel for a distance of 150 mtr leads us to the sanctum sanctorum where deities Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswathi in the form of saligram can be seen. Miniature is the size, partially the deities are below ground and the other half above GL. The presence of all in one place is what adds Shakthi to the lord which is transformed into blessing to the pilgrims undertaking the arduous trip. As per practice in the temple there is Special Harathi every day at 6 30 am and 8 30 pm. The Harathi is preceded by chanting slokas on the lord for 2 hrs. Pilgrims who wish to take part have to get special tickets. Chant of bhajans and slokas takes us to realms of divinity and improves concentration. Participation in this event is mandatory if one has to see Harathi. Difficulty in participation is not in getting tickets as close to 150 tickets are available but more in ability to squat on floor for 2 hrs. Ladies and gents who have difficulty in squatting for long hours have to think twice before opting to see Harathi. Unlike other hills, journey down the hill is more difficult than up the hill. For the return journey the same options as listed above are available. The best way to reach Katra is to take a train from Delhi. It is 12 hour journey."
745,"Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine- Great faith, pilgrimage spot. A Must do visit for Pilgrims/Trekkers","Osm place , environment ,  fresh water and easily get things what ever you want like medical etc. must visit"
746,Mesmerizing place and internal peace,Over the years my belief in mata rani has increased leaps and bounds so I recommend every one to atleast once go there and do the darshans. You will be blessed.Walking up is a great experience though people with small kids can use ponies or palki. I would let the helicopter services be used by the needy like I used to when my kids were too young but then that's a personal choice.This place has a charm about it and it's a must go for all.
747,Divine bhavan,"It's the vital power of the goddesses Vaishno which thrives every devotee for the difficult trek associated with Shrine.It involves the climb of more than 6000ft and length of more than 9Km,one way.Kind of satisfaction and peace of mind you get at the top is phenomenal.Every one visiting here is required to get registered at the beginning Baanganga, the receipt of which is verified at three different location upto the temple at top.Jai Mata Di"
748,Yatra,The place is quite divine and the vibes are amazing. It's quite accessible by the road. These days helicopter facilities are also available by the shrine board.
749,Must go ,This is a awesome place and everyone must go there... jai mata di.. sure bolo jai mata di..Prem se bolo jai mata di... jai mata di...
750,Vaishnodevi Yatra ,"Heaven on earth , mata rani sabka kalyan karen , mata rani takes all your pain and gives you aashirwad"
751,Jai Mata Di ,"As it's a very holy place in India, it's very crowded during festivals or in the holidays. It's a huge climb, nearly 14 kilometres. You could take the steps or the road. The steps are faster and cleaner but tiring. The road is full of horse poop and is usually opted by devout people. The steps and the road are side by side. There are a lot of shops selling prasad, food, snacks, refreshments, massages, etc. There is also a government initiated food place where you can get kadhi chawal and rajma chawal at the best deal. Those are the tastiest. Other than that, there is chole puri also. I suggest you book a dharmshala for the night in advance if you have plans for staying. Usually, it takes 6-7 hours to climb comfortably. The Darshan has a very long queue. So, if you have kids, please look at that fact carefully. There is also a snan ghat, or the bathing place where people usually have a bath in ice cold water. If you can't find a place to stay, you can take a mattress and a blanket on rent from a shop below. There is staircase leading to there near the govt. restaurant."
752,Amazing pilgrimage place get so much peace,The most spiritual place to visit. The most beautiful feeling in the world to reach here. Went here to seek blessings of God. It was snowing at that time when I reached halfway.
753,"Beautiful hills and fog, walk thru clouds",hotel is very gud nyc and best facilites available on this hotel we enjoy like fyghghjknh jhf jhujiu
754,Vaisnodevi Darshan-JAI MATA DI,"I had a very nice experience visiting this temple. Tried all the routes possible and will explain all to all of you. Reaching Katra is easy by train with so many tunnels in between Jammu and Katra. Feels nice about the Government. Katra station is clean and nice. One can hire pre paid transport from Station to Ban Ganga post (Previous) or Tarakote post (New route) for the climb. Tarakote route is still a naive route with not much of the stalls, traffic or for that matter any stalls. We started from Ban Ganga. Rates of Palki - Rs 3000/- approx, Pony Rs 800 approx. If a senior citizen is in the family, better to take palikes till Ardhkunwari as u get Battery operated ECars from Ardhkunwari to Mandir(Also called Bhawan). I has made all the bookings of stay three months prior including Atka Aarti also. I walked all around till Bhawan. At Bhawan, we reported at Gate No 2 for Atka Arti. Being online booking, we only took gifts from SDM office near Gate No 2 and then entered in the Mandir. The process was very smooth without any big queue. Completed the exclusive Aarti by 0800 and then went around the temple. the ropeway from Bhawan to Bhairon baba route is near completion. Should be expected to start before 2018 Navratri, if Govt wants. Returning was by ecar till Ardhkunwari and then followed the Tarakote route. Its scenic, beautiful but still a long way to go. best part of this new route is that there are no ponies allowed, hence there was no foul smell of horses/pony."
755,Good Darshan,"Divine experience visiting the place. Very nice views, while covering the path. You can hire horse to cover the path. Keep few warm clothes as there is lower temperature at bhawan."
756,Vaishno Devi,This is best holy place in katra. Yatries come here from all over the world. Best place is this. Yatra is around 14 km long . Very best area. I recommend to all to come katra. Jai Mata Di jai Mata Di.
757,Very well coordinated shrine,"Viry nice trip of me with my brothers and friends to the Darbaar of Maa, I want to go for darsan of Maa again and again,"
758,Visit to Vaishno Devi (VD) Bhawan in 1 day,"‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§¶‡•Ä ‚ÄúChants of devotion ,the air filled with vibrant positive energy ,a journey of spiritual redemption #Mata Vaishno Devi ji‚Äù‚ÄúChalo bulawa aaya hai ..mata ne bulaya hai‚ÄùWe are  blessed to have our darshan at Mata Vaishno Devi and specially on my son prateek birthday!! Important things to remember Book helicopter tickets online before 4 months Must try rajma chawal Must visit to apna pan dhaba on jammu -katra highway Must visit to dominos only pure veg. Many road side dhabas To have peaceful darshan must try in off season ..!!"
759,"""Jai Mata Di""","Being allowed to sit in front of holy cave during the Aarti is in itself a blessing. The overall Aarti experience is pious, mesmerising and divine. Being  fortunate enough to be a part of this whole process of worshiping Maa Vaisanodevi is something which makes you feel closer to Maa and fulfils your purpose of visiting the shrine."
760,Vaishno Devi Darshan,"Holy experience worth every minute spent. The best part is the walk to the shrine which takes 3 hours and 14 kms. The path is well paved with shelter and lots of eating and resting options. Easy with VIP pass, the every minute spent in the cave is worth it. Must visit"
761,Jai Mata D,Visit to this plan is only when Mata wishes it is ideal to take a helicopter but please check weather always keep one reserve day in case the weather turns bad you can't go upIt is must that you visit Bhariva post mata Darshan then your pilgrimage would be complete
762,JAI MATA DI,"It was an awesome experience. Though we went in chopper, we decided to climb down walking via Bhairon Ghat! Since there was no rush, we had Darshan in 15 min. It was an awesome and divine experience in the Sanctum Santorum of the Bhavan. Everything happens like a clockwork here. Getting the Bhent, keeping our belongings in the locker, etc etc. The trek itself is an awesome experience. Every few meters there are eating joints, beverage outlets, wash rooms, water points etc. Hospitals with basic facilities are also available at few places and their locations are displayed prominently and announced regularly. All in all, it was a divine experience with an urge to go back! Kudos to the Mata Vaishnodevi Shrine Board for all the excellent arrangements."
763,The Place of Divine,"holy temple was wonderful...jai mata,,,,,enjoyed the hotel.... stayed at hotel bhargav...loved it...thank you"
764,JAI MATA DI,We gone with family. Place is good and beautiful. No need to have any comment on way as it is always clean. Good discount food given. I really enjoy there days.
765,Blissful darshan,Jai Mata Di! Great experience. Very helpful people around. Really worth a visit. Beautiful place! Blessed to be able to visit. Thanks and regards.
766,"Divine  Experience , Cave Temple of Maa Vaishno Devi Ji","You can‚Äôt express the feeling and the aura that you experience while visiting Vaishno devi. The complete trek is amazing. There is a unique faith or belief that would make you travel around   25km by walk, all to witness and seek blessings from Matas for few seconds only. Wonderful arrangements done by government- multiple well managed, neat and clean pathway, easy accessibility to clean wash rooms, cafeterias, food stalls, paid electric car service for old age people, ropeway and helicopter services- Fully secured and well managed area. I have never seen anything grand than this, where thousands or even more people are visiting every minute and the complete shrine board team makes a healthy and safe stay possible for each one of us."
767,Jai Mata Di,"The last time i visited the place, it has improved drastically,it is now very clean, i saw sweepers all along my way, there were sheds, water coolers, benches to sit on, as the place is now under Army, it is now very well managed"
768,Divine energies,"Can't describe in words about .. how pious and holy the temple is  .. it's very organised which includes getting a ticket from the start point ie Katra... You have many modes of transportation like mules, autorickshaw, heptr etc.. Adequate Sulabh shochalaya and eating joints enroute.So sir se boloJai Mata di"
769,very peaceful place,"This was my fifth trip to Vaishno Devi, this time with friends in January, and as always I enjoyed my trip, darshans were very comfortable. Compared to the crowd I found in Jun 2017 it was pretty smooth for me. We started chadhaai at 4 PM and by 8:30 PM we were at Bhawan, some of us took bath and and did darshan at late night, after this we had dinner and started for Bhairo Nath and reached there in 1 hour or so. From Bhairo Nath it took us again 4:30 Hrs to come down and by 6 AM we were in Katra.Views are nice while doing chadhaai, one suggestion , one should never take stairs as it will make you drain off very fast, better go by the road , after Adhkumari it is a bit comfortable. Old people may prefer taking Helicopter services if they are running at that time.Jai Mata Di !!!"
770,Mystery of goddess all over the place from 1st step to last,"First mistake we did was to visit this place in June. ( Its very hot, even in the nights and at such high altitude). So to start the yatra, we need to take a token which is available at Katra railway station(not sure if is available at other places) We started our yatra at 9 PM as it would be a herculean task to cover it in the day with the temperatures dancing at 40degrees. There are 4 options available 1)by walk(free,freee,freeee) 2)by Poni(min 2500/-) 3)by Palanquins(min 5000/-) 4)by helicopter(2000/- but you need to book this well ahead) Thing is, you cant trust anyone here. Being a sacred place, i got disturbed when i saw people here looting money of devotees. You need to have good bargain skills otherwise your flight tickets would cost you lesser than what you pay for ponies or palanquins. I suggest you go for option 1 because though you sit on pony, at the end your inner thighs and buttocks would hurt very bad. There are two roads one can take to go by walk, please please take the new road as the older one is damn steep and tough. The toilets are not well maitained. Be prepared. There are lot of food stalls on the way, so no need to worry about that. It would be a total of 13 kms from the starting point to reach the temple. Please plan to do the Yatra aaaaram se. Best luck !"
771,Bliss,"Amazing pilgrimage. I like the fact is route is much cleaner. Lot of eateries and toilets on route. Options of palki, ponies and pithu for children, elderly or disabled."
772,Jai Mata Di,"Had Perfect Darshan in hot and crowded June. We were thinking that with such high temperatures in June summer vacations, a nice and calming darshan would be difficult. But we had peaceful moments and we had darshan at 12:00 in the night."
773,cold and better environment,"Wonderful place to visit and it's worth have blessing of mother,  l am not a usual visitor to temples but after visiting this place insisted by friends I really thank them now."
774,Shrine in the clouds....aptly named.,"U r lucky if u had chance to visit maataji ka darbaar.... be feel lucky... Tips: Don't miss aarti . either book online or visit darbaar before 5.pm as tickets will issued around 5.30 from office ....1000/-per psnAfter aarti just quickly run to darbaar for darshan , u ll get plenty of time for darshanIf u r hvg aarti tickets than don't worry about ur valuable luggage as they hvng special area to keep in lockers otherwise too much time take to keep things in lockers during rush hours..either skipped and do darshan of arthkuwari if u want to go darbaar on a time , coz it will be big time consuming in arthkuwari due to slow pace darshan ... u can do it in Return..In case if u feel unwell little bit pl visit Healthcare centre at various places , dont pushes to ur self too much, they providing free cost very decent servicesJai mata di"
775,Amazing trip.. Jai Mata Di!!,"There are no words to describe the experience of darshan at mata.Quick snippet and tips.Book online...the Yatra parchi is valid then for 24 hrs. Else only 6 hrs. Also won't need to stand in queue to get stamped.The road is nice, well lit full of shops...so enjoy the 13 km walk up the hill.I always suggest an evening climb as it is pleasant and less crowded.The roads are full of dung though...from the ponies. So walk around them.The climb from halfway to shrine was steep. Even steeper was climb to Bhairo nath. But worth it. The journey back was easier.I started climbing at 7pm and returned at 6am...a 27 km up and down journey.The shrine tunnel is new and we'll lit now.Lots of places all along to rent ponies, palki, blankets etc. Lots of restrooms all along the way. Though eateries disappear after the first couple kms...then only chai stalls. Until the shrine. Occasional eatery does exist.Overall the experience is amazing, spirited, inspiring and devotional. Like people say, mata ka bulawa!"
776,Good wonderful experience and a nice enjoyable trip,I visit this hotel this is awesome hotel. I love this hotel.in this hotel here is to silence everywhere comfortableness.Service is very good and well maintained.
777,Jai Mata Ji di,"I had visited Vaishno Devi back in 2009-2010, and this time just yesterday . Over a period of 8 years I thought that the facities to prevent over crowding and better management would be there . However, it wasn't the case at all .I felt like the place was heavily crowded at the bhawan and there were less people to look after or to manage the crowd . There were women carrying small babies and the crowd was such that there could easily been a mishappening. It was a little sad to see the situation and thought why this world known shrine doesn't match to the world class standards as theirs. One of the best examples is golden temple at Amritsar which is managed beautifully .There were some things which had changed for good which was the track from bhawan to adhkuwari was changed with a better track. However lot more needs to done . Mainly it is better management of crowd . And some services like helicopter services should be available when people want , it shouldn't be that the tickets are fully booked ."
778,Joy Mata Do.,"We have visited this temple on the last Monday of March 2018. In case u are visiting for the first time, please keep in mind the following points:1. Need to register first and it took almost less than 10 minutes for a family of 8 and kids less than 3 years do not require registration. Preserve this slip at it is very much required at the temple security entrance.2. The journey length is 24 kms in total i.e. 12 up and 12 down in which first 6.5 kms is a bit tough especially for Elders. Thereafter the next 5.5 kms is normal and can be easily covered. The journey takes about 12 to 13 hrs in total if visited on a week day.3. For elders there is doli and for children there is Pittoo. The cost for one doli will end up to about 5000/- (includes food for 4) and for Pittoo (1000/-) that includes food.4. Its better to start early as there would be crowd at later time.5. No items are allowed at the security gate inclusive of items such as pen. Hence all the metaillic items including shoes are to be kept in temple lockers prior to entry. The lockers are free of charge.6. An alternative is horse that is lesser than the doli about 2000/- but takes a different route after first 6.5 kms that is harder to walk i.e if some are on horse and some are walking the walking team is going to get affected thereafter.7. Plenty of eating options available and are delicious too.8. The helicopter rides is cheaper. But need to walk for additional 2.5 kms though doli are available at that locations for which the cost is unknown. But I prefer taking a doli from bottom as moving through this are would be great.9. There are lots of places where boards are kept indicating shooting stone. Hence, care to be taken not to walk on hill side in those areas. The above points won't hold good in case the visit is on Weekends as in these days the rush is huge. I hope the above review would be helpful for the first timers."
779,Don't need any introduction or review,Peaceful and well planned and organized. Loved the bhajans coming out of the Base speakers throughout the trek.
780,Excellent Experience,"It's our second visit to this divine place this year. Took helicopter ride to sanchichat, Which was again a great experience. Took almost 30 minutes to reach Gauri Bhawan where our rooms were booked. After taking rest we moved for evening aarti and dharsan.No words to express this kind of experience.Simply amazing and divine.Stayed overnight in Gauri Bhawan. Comfortable stay.Returned morning around 8 with first helicopter service.I must mention facilities has been improved a lot and must compliment the shrine board for the same."
781,Plan ..plan ..plan..,"It is advisable to book the Yatra Parchi through online so that you do not spend time at the parchi counters in Katra. Some hotels do offer the Yatra Parchis too.At the entry gate, the pittus and ponywalas would pounce upon you. They would speak of fixed rates but bargain can be done. Pittus can be paid 350-400 till Bhavan. Ponies till Ardhkuwari can be paid anything from 300-400 for single adult/ child + adult."
782,Heavenly trip,"Vaishno Devi, also known as Mata Rani, Trikuta and Vaishnavi. Located at Trikoot Parvat, Mata Vaishno Mandir is the holiest shrine of India and it is famous all over the World. Vaishno Devi is the second most-visited shrines of India, first being the Balaji Temple at Tirupati.I boarded my train at New Delhi Railway station and stepped down at Katra Station. It was a night journey so I got sufficient time to sleep and make my body ready for this trip.I was initially very okay covering the distance from Banganga check post to Mata Vaishno Devi temple by walk but eventually I realized it was not an easy one. I took multiple halts during the travel and I finally reached the destination completely exhausted and tired. The entire way to the shrine is well lighted and adequate arrangements of water and public convenience have been made to facilitate the pilgrims.I took a damn cold shower before joining the devotee queue. Earlier devotees used to buy flowers, coconuts, dry-fruits and other things to make an offering to the Goddess but recently there have been changes in this aspect. One can carry coconut and chunari inside the temple. While the coconut needs to be handed over at the entrance, the devotees are allowed to carry the chunari with them. Devotees are not allowed to carry any dry fruits, food items, Jal any other items to carry along inside the temple.Unlike earlier days, devotes are no more allowed to go through the cave way as it is now closed; however, one can get a glimpse of the cave entrance while heading towards the Mata‚Äôs place inside the temple. In the cave, one can see the blissful Pindis of Maha Kali, Maha Lakshmi and Maha Saraswati.The ‚ÄúPrasad and Khazana‚Äù packets can be collected from the counter while coming out of the temple. It is free and everyone will be given one packet.While the overall experience was somewhat exhausting, it was indeed an amazing divine experience. For people, who are not capable to walk through the way ‚Äì you can hire a Pony (Mule Ride), Palaki or even can book for Helicopter (ensure you do the booking well in advance)."
783,Very Nice Darshan,"Though being among highly rated holy shrines in North part of the country, it has been more of commercial affair rather than divine experience.From Ban Ganga to Sh. Vaishno Devi temple is approx 13 kms on slope road, through stairs it can be minimised to about 7 kms.At 6 kms comes the first major halt Ardh Kunwari temple. Route upto here is full of pony and hand shoulder-cart carriers with shops ready to serve food and refreshments. Water tanks placed by shrine board are of not much use. Though canteens run by board can do some help.Just before Ardh Kunwari route divides in three parts, one old pedestrian path approx 6.5 kms, new pedestrian route approx 5.5 kms(suggested), and one seperate route for pony warriors.Necessary precautions..1. Above 50 years or unfit should avoid.2. Don't miss good sport shoes with socks.3. Carry water bottles or buy on cost, keep yourself rehydrated.4. Avoid in peak season, May June July.For more information feel free to drop mail at ryudiaries@gmail.com, or read at ryudiaries@wordpress.com"
784,Awesome trip in the rainy season.,Excellent services and pathways for all people. Only thing is you need to wait in Lines specially for Ropeway and E-Cars.
785,Vaishno Devi Katra,Surely any ages people can enjoy the sight seeing  here and also enjoy the climate. The temple on the top of the hill and enjoy the walking
786,Jai mata di...,Truly a great experience.. I am there every year and it keeps getting better every year...good facilities for food and water
787,Jai Mata Di,Spiritual Heaven in lap of mother Goddess nature . A must visit for religious families atleast once in a few years
788,Holy Shrine..Jai Mata di.,Very scenic walk of 18 kM to top of hills . It's very good nature walk and hiking to mountain. Prefer to go during summers
789,Jai Mata Di!,"Its is said that you only get to go when she calls for you! Very trueEnough said about the place, mere me cant add anything to it. I will just sahre some tips and tricks and recent events for better planning. These are applicable as of writing ( Mar 18) and may change in future1) All types of hotels available in Katra - from 200 Rs dharamshaala to expensive White Hotels. Generally you get what you pay for!2) Carry light for travel to bhavan - due to renovation , very few lockers available.3) Medicines and food available at every few km4) Try avaoid stars  - up or down, if you have slightest of joint pains, gets aggrevated. But a great way to move up and down if you are healthy. 5) good shoes are absolute must - unless ofcourse you want to go barefoot6) Make sure you pay Pitthu, Palki, Ghoda guy per the published rates and not more. They are published on the walls at starting and at end. Keep their Icard as security during the travel period, to be exchanged with payment point only.7) Ghoda downwards is very risky atleast was for me - going up is still fine."
790,Very spiritual place,"One needs no description to this holy place, every one must visit this place at least once in their lives."
791,Interesting visit to Vaishno Devi.,"The temple is definitely worth a visit - try and time it when the queues are shorter, very early morning.  The trek is quite arduous.  It was raining and made it slippery.  Take the pony if you are comfortable riding one.  Book a room in advance.  Take helicopter if you can, weather permitting."
792,A Walk Of Faith to Know Your Faith,"The whole trek to the temple was enjoyable. We departed at 10 PM and reached the shrine at 3:30 AM. We had separated into three groups but without any mobile on us, we still managed to come together at the shrine gates. Such was the miracle.Inside the shrine, you get peaceful and you regain all your energy lost while climbing, once you have the darshan.Only thing is the shoe stand is open and there is no caretaker assigned so there is every possibility that your shoes may get lost. And please avoid taking your mobiles, unless you want to stand in queue for an hour to submit them in the cloak room."
793,Jai Mata Di,The abode of the kumari goddess beckons. .reverence and legends spur you to scale the mountain for a glimpse. .that divine darshan.that will be there for ever in your memory. Jai mata di. Had wonderful darshan with family..The highlight of our trip. Went up by helicopter and back down walking. The downhill walk is also very strenuous especially for children..so decide your mode of ascent and descent carefully. Just chant all the way.
794,Spritual,"I visited Katra along with my friend in end of September. Fortunately, there was no rush during that period.We stayed at Hotel Ginger. The rooms were spacious n very reasonable. Though it's located at just 5mins walk from Katra bus stand, it was very peaceful property.I highly recommend this hotel for stay for both family as well as couple. For food, I recommend Maduban restaurant located just 100 meters away from hotel on the way to Katra bus stand. The food was delicious as well as the menu had wide array of dishes to choose from.A perfect combination for anyone planning to visit Katra."
795,Spiritual trip,"My fourth visit and this time I can here for 3 days,hoping to enjoy nearby places as well.Lets first address the elephant in the room ..the pilgrimage ...well my wife is a great devotee of Mata Vaishno Devi and so loves coming here.For me all temples are of equal importance and I usually prefer temples which are less crowdy and peaceful.For all the staunch devotees of Godess Durga, the place is a must visit.With a rail link to Katra it has become more convenient and there are enough train options to suit different time schedule needs.Like any other religious tourist city,the place is full of different types of people..most of them are here for religious purposes. the local markets are full of dry fruits(sub par standards) and goons/salesmen,pls consider avoiding them before or after Yatra.The Yatra itself felt like is being used by the Shrine board and Govt. to provide employement to locals,my pithoo guy told me that there are more than 10000 ponies registered with Vaishno Devi Shrine board,who create a menace throughout the Yatra Marg.If not carefull these horses can run over pedestrian piligims.Their charges are dependent on your tiredness and they all have a great sense of coordination so if one guy ask you money which is much more than what's displayed on the rate boards of Shrine board,rest others will echo the same thing,so if you want to avail a ponny,don't negotiate much..as that wouldn't yeild any result.The Shrine board has 5 restraunts on the way to main temple (Bhavan)..which offer simple and cheap food with a promise of hygiene.If one feels he can't cover distance of 13 KMs on foot then helicopter is your best bet,pls do your homework before going for a ride about the aging and service etc.They can be booked online and operate during day timeing only.Old age people can avail battery operated carts which helps in covering 5-6 KMs of distance.For this you would need to carry age proof and the number of these vehicles are very limited so the 20-25 seats are given on first come and first serve basis and the person giving tickets doesn't think of himself less than president of India.This rationing of Battety operated vechiles is to perhaps protect the employment of pithoos,ponnies etc.Although these vehicles can be immensely helpful and timesaving.The efforts,time and pain of completing the Yatra can be reduced vastly by this and other means e.g.rope way etc. Only if the govt. and the shrine Board is willikg to let go the votes.Throughout the Yatra Marg several infomation boards are displayed but none gives the complete information and advice how to plan this complete  Yatra."
796,well managed temple,"Really wonderful mountains...and scenery. The temple is too a nice place and you can choose to walk, ride a horse or a Palki. There are also pitthus for children. The walk is a long journey but worth it. The prices might be increased and there are weather changes and landslides very rarely."
797,Excellent place,"Can't review this divine place . It's a special place with a special divine feeling. I've seen the facilities improve over the years and while is still very busy, things are well managed here"
798,Worth a Visit ,"It was the first time for me to get a chance to see the temple. But I felt very sorry for the SHRINE BOARD's arrangements. I think, I will not go again there. People from the different parts of INDIA were TRAPPED there with their small kids, due to heavy rush. There was not a single thing,  you can say that there is a BOARD who is responsible for the upkeep of temple."
799,Jai mata di,This is the place where u get positive energy! U feel like u r in heaven..Mata Vaishno Devi is a must visit place for everyone who has faith in God ! There are proper arrangements for food water on every step and the whole path is covered with shelter !! Amazing work done by Shrine board ! Once you come here u will forget all ur worries & just chant 'jai Mata di' ..Mata ji please call me every year ....Jai Mata Di !!
800,Very well Managed Darshan !!!,Nice religious place but experience could have been further elevated if support from people is more and helpful
801,Jai mata di!!,"i was visit in January.. so it was to cold there its about -1 and -2 minimum temperature there but is very good experience and you can feel Spiritual vibes there .. very nice views from kaal bhairav temple.. and very good facility there.. water, tea , coffee and some good food and beverage provide by hotels and Coffee cafe day is also there way to vaisno devi temple"
802,Holy place,you can visit here in any time during the year. here you will find 14 KM foot journey over the mountain but you will not be tired and feel energetic during your journey. you must go there. really amazing feeling after darshan of mata vaishnov devi.
803,best place to visit in jammu,Can Anyone complain about the abode of mother ?? just mesmerising. We went as a family and that too during the navaratris. The experience was pure bliss.
804,Blessed,"The place is just awesome, requires a little level of physical fitness to walk the track but the serene beauty can only be experienced by walking"
805,Must Do!,"There are 2 Temple one is Original which gets open rarely may be in feb or march, whenever crowd is less than 10000 in a day.

808,Excellent,"This is a temple dedicated to Goddess Vaishno Devi. Goddess Vaishno Devi is a form of female energy of all the trinity Goddess - Goddess Lakshmi, Goddess Saraswati and Goddess Kali. The temple has rich architecture and is very well maintained. Devotees throng here to have their wishes fulfilled by their Mother Vaishno Devi.  The temple is mostly crowded. Hence sufficient time needs to be kept for the visit. Temple is well maintained."

Booked the tickets online for travel, helicopters, accommodation and aarti. Was an amazing experience and were able to perform darshan twice!Note - You need to carry a parchi with your group number. You will get this in Katra."
811,Always a Divine Experience ,"Plan and take your time .. Hire a pitthu ..Its a must..Start at 5 am ..Reach Ardhkuwari before 8 am ..Its Perfectly halfway..Take electric car at 300 rs per person and go straight to base of Shrine..tAKE LOCKERS OR DORMITORY ..WASH , SHOWER AND PROCEED TO SHRINE..Walking down is no problem but better take your time.."
812,Beautiful Divine,It was really fantastic experience. Spent valuable time with my complete family...love to make more trips like same..
813,Vaisno devi trip,It's a every year visit !! A place where one would want to go again and again !! This time I went in summers !! Though scorching heat n difficult to walk but still the excitement for darshan makes it easy !! The evening atka Aarti was just super and was very well organized !! The bhazans n shloks chanting mesmerizes the atmosphere !! As u walk up there are speakers through out the way and the bhazans which are played are just a super boost !! Jai mata di !!
814,Divine,"Went for the first time. Heard from many people in past, but this time I felt it was chalo bulawa aaya h for me!! Went along with my entire family. Great atmosphere. Worth visit. Well managed. Jai Mata Di !!"
815,Divine,"The most beautiful journey to reach the Goddess. The most religious spot. Its whole way is awesome, it keeps you so close to nature and God. Sudden formation of clouds is really amazing. The roads are good till Mata. There are different lanes for people and ponies which makes it easy and safe."
816,More beautiful than before!!,Do peaceful palace with gr8 views and so much food stall their and photograph studios with some massage chair also...Tracking is fun but be aware with the Palki (mules) and also need to aware from monkey
817,Awesome visit,Walked for 17hrs. Too tiring trip. Yet awesome experience. My son was too tired while returning. Since it was night so we couldn't availed the auto service.
818,Holiest place one can be ..,"It would not be right to write review of this place but the Shrine Board has done excellent work. The journey from barganga to Shrine is around 12 Km and there are many ways by which one can climb faciities of Helicopter, Horses and Palki are available throughout. One can also take battery operated rickshaw from mid- way till the shrine. There are full facilities available throughout the route."
819,6 hrs Walk to reach,This is the best place to come and free the mind to remove all stress .this is nice.i not give guarantee but give suggestions according to me
820,Devine Place,Its nyc place for family . U can go there with family and enjoy your trip and also you can go with friends
821,Religious place,I cant describe in words about this journey. This was my 27th annual trip to this place. A lot has changed in past years but the sense of spirituality and holiness this place offers is unique.
822,"very very nice place,",The most religious spot.Its awesome climate with a feeling of nature around you clouds touching and giving the coolness
823,A trip to be remembered .,this place is  so beautiful at the hill top. It is an awesome place to visit... everyone should come here at least once
824,Vaishnodevi trek,"it is place one visit it least once in life ,it is the heaven on the earth afterwards your living consciouness will be high"
825,wonderful journey,"calm, peaceful, and tranquil....one can never get tired of visiting Vaishnodevi...a must visit for everyone...though trekking can be little uncomfortable due to the never ending lines of horse riders. Management should also focus on the cleanness of the place as it also attracts a lot of foreign travelers."
826,Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine,Rainy and Winter seasons (specially between August to December) are the best time to visit this place.
827,Maa ka bulava,Had osm experience and the staff is to gud nd punctual timing of service is too godd and fast impressive staff and well dresd room is also clean and comfortable next tym I ll again stay in this hotel
828,Divine ,"This is a fantastic temple visit. The moment you approach the temple vicinity you feel blessed. We took the helicopter both ways and could complete the trip in 3hours from the time we sat in the helicopter. This is a great way to go if you are short on time otherwise it is advisable to stay a night in the temple area. Overall, undoubtedly, a phenomenal place to go to. Thank you the supreme being for allowing us to visit Vaishno Devi."
829,I went Vaishno Devi 2 times,Life time experience. Great feelings. Sense of satisfaction. Undergo  process of self introspection.An opportunity to see life in true sense and benefitted by Ma blessings.
830,Sheer Bliss and Adventure.,It was a trip to remember....if you visit with your familiy or friends travelling about 14 km on the mountain does not feel fatigue if you have awesome people in your squad.Its a must visit spot if you want tadka of both adventure and sprituality.
831,Jai Mata Di,"We heard all sort of things and suggestions before we started out trek, but not many of them were totally reliable. Therefore I thought let me put my own account of things. I started the trek with my wife at exact 5 pm, and we reached at the Bhavan at around 8.45 pm. We did this on foot and took plenty of rests. My wife walks at a comfortable pace so I was matching her pace and we also took a number of breaks in between. I can make a few suggestions basis our experience: 1. If you decide to walk, the best time to reach there is after 11 pm. That is because there is a Aarti from 8.30-9.30pm and the darshan is stopped because of that and the queue builds up. I suggest that you reach by 11, have some rest and then get in the queue and your darshan should be done in 30-45 mins. 2. There are two ways to walk up. Around half way mark you will have two ways to trek to the bhavan - via Himkoti or via Sanjichhat. I'll suggest go via Himkoti and that because only walking people are allowed through this route. The horses are allowed through the other route and it becomes difficult to walk with horses coming from both the sides. Not to mention that the entire place will smell of horse dung. 3. There are battery operated cars available for elderly and disabled. They operate on the Himkoti route and is free of charge. The only thing is that the service stops between 9pm and 6am. 4. If you are traveling via Himkoti you will get a locker facility just before the Bhavan. Use Thai instead of locker 2 facility, which is much closer to the Bhavan as locker one has much smaller queue and it will take lesser time to store your belongings. 5. Do not carry heavy baggage as it will become difficult to trek up. 6. If you are going upto Kal Bhairav - the trek is quite steep but not to mention it's still doable. It took us 40 minutes to reach there on foot. Else you may take horse service. 7. There are two ways to trek down from Kal Bhairav. One is to come back to Bhavan and trek down via Himkoti. Other is via Sanjichaat. The later one is smaller and therefore we took that. 8. They are steps that look like a shortcut. I'll suggest do not take the steps while trekking up as it's much more tiring and will have an heavy impact on your knees. While coming down you may take the stairs as it will cut down time and distance. However, it will eventually be heavy in your ankles but that's you may try and take a call. We took as many stairs as possible while coming down. 9. There are Pooja and Prasad shops all the way up. However, you may go right upto the Bhavan and buy your things there - will save you from carrying heavy weight while trekking up. Similarly you may buy Prasad for relatives towards the end while coming down. 10. Cameras and phones are allowed. But you will have to keep them in locker. Same for any leather items. Locker facility is pretty safe and free of cost. 11. Ardhkuwari darshan is more time consuming than the Mata darshan. So you may decide if you want to go for it or not. We decided to skip it. 12. Have plenty of fluids and water. Hope this helps. Jai mata di!"
832,Jai Mata Di,"I visit the shrine every year, and every year is a new experience, last year i visited in the month of March 2018, Its takes around 4-5 hours to climb the mountain and reach the bhavan, We do have Palki, Pony's and Helicopter facilities, The Best time to travel is March onwards. If you would like to witness snow, then you can probably travel in the month of Dec-Jan... Routes by Walk are as follows... Banganga-Charan paduka-Adhkumari,- Haathi matha-Sanjhichat-Bhavan and bharav... Do visit bharav nath or else the Darshan is incomplete.."
833,vaishno devi temple,Very good place ..Make your booking in advance to have a hassle free trip.. do visit near places like nau devian ... Which is 9 km from katra
834,Jai mata di,"A visit to Vaishno Devi is always such a fulfilling experience. This time, it had been snowing for the past few days and there was snow all along the path and at the Bhavan. Thankfully, there was no snow or rain during our climb."
835,Jai Mata Di,4th visit in 5 years... what better can you ask for . Feel blessed that we get a call from Mata Rani every year. Jai Mata Di......!!
836,Excellent place with a different ambience...,"Plan the visit well in advance and avoid the rainy season. The shrine can be reached from Katra via a 14 KM long trek, or taking a Helicopter till Sanjhichat and then a walk down of 2.5 KM. There are options of hiring Horses/Ponnies (approx. 700/-) or taking a Palki (approx. 3000/-). There are battery operated carts also available for people of old age/suffering from any physical ailment or pregnant women. The cart operates between Ardhkuwari and Bhawan (the shrine). It is advisable to avoid carrying heavy bags or stuffs. If you are carrying offerings (Prasad) and walking up, keep it safe from some naughty monkeys ready to snatch at the slightest of the hint :)Take breaks during the climb and enjoy the eternal feeling once you reach the Bhawan for the Darshan"
837,Jai mataa di,I was here in winters with my friends and family. We really enjoyed our treak to the cave.Although it is long way up but we rested at many places and have snacks and fun.
838,Visit to Vaishnu Devi,"A wonderful trip with family members. Had heard a lot about it but it was altogether a different experience visiting the divine god. We visited in the month of June which was bit rainy and not sunny on the day we reached. We started in the evening and reached the Bhavan at around 11 pm with rest in between. As all the dorms and hotels were full and booked we slept on the open terrace. Its better to do advance booking for the dorms if travelling with young kids. No need to carry lot of food or water during the travel up/down  as there are enough stalls/shops at reasonable price throughout the distance. Its overall a 12 KM walk. You can opt for Pitthus(For luggage and kids) , ponies or palkies (Though they charge heavily as compared to what is declared on the boards and rate charts). If you plan to walk keep yourself light as much as possible as it becomes very difficult to carry even a handbag later :). Better to take a pitthu for bags (They charge reasonably approx. 300-400 for 3-4 bags) .We were lucky to get thru the Gate 5 and darshan was done very quickly. If planning avoid this time as lot of visiters due to summer vacations."
839,Jai mata di ,this is one place dat i had been longing to go and i was lucky dat i cud make a trip to visit one of the most holy place with my entire family. der is nothin new dat i can describe here but wud wna tel u ppl.... u shud visit it atlst once in ur life time if not more...
840,Devotional Trip,Very nice experience i am lots of enjoyed with my family some minor issue are coming but its not big problem for me..i am going everry year such wonderfull Experince..Jai mata Di..!
841,Vaishno Devi mata ,It is a great experience trekking up the hill.The entire route is very well maintained and medical facilities are available throughout. Thousands of people keep walking alongside ponies carrying people but the roads are cleaned continuously. The trek takes around 5 hours but the mata gives the strength and one doesn't feel the strain.we were blessed to have a wonderful darshan. We also walked up to Bhairavnath temple which is at a higher altitude. The cottages at Bhawan are also very comfortable and cosy.
842,When devotion and nature comes together,Great city very nice market cheap accomadation and awesome vibes and power of Maa best time to visit April.. Jai mata di
843,Very Powerful Devi Temple,"This is the one of temple, I am visiting for last few years.You may hear the same thing from anyone who have been there.Divine and Peaceful."
844,Osm trip,very hard walk but worth it. it was cold at night and the services where okay there but more information before hand would be good.
845,Best place for pilgrimage,Its my 30th trip to the shrine in 30 years. As always i come in off season and midle of week so plan accordingly to avoid rush. Accommodation available both at katra and main bhawan as required. Every pilgrim is registered for darshan and same is done at airport at jammu or railway station at katra or registration centres in katra . Except airport the yatra slip is valid for 6 hrs to pass the iniitial check post at banganga.The trek is about 25kms up and down .Without rush takes an average of 12 hours.
846,Must visit once in a lifetime ,"Vaishno Devi Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu Mother Goddess Maa Lakshmi, located in Katra at the Trikuta Mountains within the Indian state of Jammu Kashmir. The temple is surrounded by hills and nature give peace to soul and mind."
847,Mata Darshan,Here the different types things available like dry fruits dried Apple kissmis all the things are cheep and the best hotels serve better food
848,She is there. she listens her devotees,"This is amongst the holiest of the Hindu shrines globally. The journey is breathtaking and the surrounding mountains and the chants of Jai Mata Di across the length and breadth of the whole trip makes it easy for people of any age, gender to climb the hill. The provisions by the Mata Vaishno Shrine Board for the coming Yatris are more than enough and one cannot ask for more. All the basic neccessities have been taken care, right frm food to security. This is a must visit place for finding some inner peace."
849,Jai Maata di,Starting with an advice reserve everything in advance like helicopter ride. It use to gets full 3months in advance and best helicopter to choose is the last one which come back 1at in the morning if opting for round trip. I took helicopter ride from the helipad you still need mules to reach the complex. Visit the complex as well as the bhairav nath temple. Advice for old and young children take an helicopter ride and use mules for rest specially when going to bhairav nath temple the route is too steep and tiring. Book your special Pooja u will love it . Jai kata di
850,Extremely Good,No words or gestures can describe the Shrine and it's divinity. What can be described is the route journey to the Holy shrine. The shrine board has taken good care of the pilgrim route with all facilities and cleanliness. All the charges from a labour to a horse is regulated. Utmost care is taken for the safety of the pilgrims but only one thing which is not under control is the Monkeys enroute who snatch any bag from pilgrims and run away.
851,Jai Mata Di!,"Obviously you go to pay your respects. There are multiple ways to go.....by foot, on horse or on a palkhi. If you have the time and are able to, go by foot or you can take the horse up and on foot down"
852,mata rani,I am a 32 years old man and it took near about 4.5 hours (Includes 1 hour for rest) to climb the Vaishnodevi mandir by foot. If you are a healthy person just walk. Do not go for the horse ride or you 'll miss the adventure and beauty of the place. From Ardhkuwari there are two routes. Take the left route which is Himkoti route. And do not buy anything from the outside as they 'll loot you. Just enter through the gateway and you 'll find many stalls selling the items for puja in a cheap rate. You can also buy the walking sticks from there @ Rs.10 per piece.
853,Jai Mata Di,The whole experience of walking and paying visit to the goddess is simply divine..definitely recommend to visit at least once in lifetime.
854,Vaishno Devi Temple,"My review is not of the temple but the road to it. Its really a very bad experience to walk on the way to the temple till the point they separate the horse road from the new electric cart road. The government must focus on cleanliness. If not for the temple, anybody hardly would like to visit here."
855,Holy,Hamari family ne vaishnodevi jana hai tau hamari family me ek handicapt person hai jo nhi chal sakti vo wheelchair se he chalti hai tau hum bhawan tak kaise jaye hame barganga se electric rickshaw bhi nhi milenga tau please bataiye
856,Feel solace in lap of mata,"Very holy and nice place to visit. You will feel really tough to walk but once you are done with the dharsan, you will feel the really good and pure. I visit the place every year and will again visit this year. All the best. If you have any questions feel free to message me here, i will help"
857,Best place to visit,Wonderful experience. Even though the going was tough. .people made it pleasant. Would like to bring my daughter and hubby next time.
858,Commercialised,"One of the most exciting trip of my life, we decided to walk up the hill and what an experience we had.we started at 21.15 and reached at 05.15 as we walked slowly taking breathing breaks in between.very well organised system by the authorities .its a different feeling all together .Darshan was divine in the morning ."
859,An excellent visit,I went here with my wife to seek Mata's blessings.  It was a blissful experience. People from every sphere come here. Food is  available on the route. No age bar is there. People come walk or book a poni or sometimes people book helicopter as well. If they are in hurry or they cannot walk. But the moment you reach the Mata's abode you forget about your worries.
860,Most auspicious pilgrimage up north,Great place.facilities improved a lot from the last time I had  visited the  place.battery operated  vehicles are  available  along with the traditional  pithoos (guide) n palanquains n horses...lots of eateries have opened ..along with good lightings n toilet facilities...overall a great memorable trip
861,Visit to Vaishno Devi,A must for every one. The trekking path is well laid and secure. Darshan arrangements are excellent.
862,Blissfull Experience,Darshan was woderful . And my stay in lemeontree was also good with pleasant atmosphere. Good hotel to stay for darshan in katra.
863,Really spiritual and soothing,If you are travelling during holidays or weekends make your accomodation and train reservation well in advance.....
864,Spiritual experience.,"Went with my son prior to his joining engineering college. Avoid stairs both while climbing and descending.Start early evening , cool night weather is helpful"
865,gr8,"good infra and facility once can expect. though they need to train their people .. we saw one guy was down with heart attach and when inquired about emergency no , security guy dint had a clue. we even tried phone no that was listed every where ( 9797477777)..one request to one and all please please keep area clean dont litter.. they have place dustbin at all location use them .. help one who need help.."
866,To Seek Blessings,"Though its a 14 km walk, but so well maintained pathways would not give you any feeling of the exhersion. The pathways are regularly cleaned, shades from sun and rain all through the pathway, scenic beauty as you climb up, different types of birds singing for you along the way dotted by well maintained washrooms make the walk very exciting. There are shops for snacks, food and drinking water all throughout. Bhavan is so well maitained even though there are million footfalls. Good food and stay facilities attempt to comfort every pilgrim. This is one place I would wish to visit again. Jai Mata Di!"
867,Beautiful experience.,Awesome place no word left to describe this holy place. Everyone must visit in lifetime more than once. Chalo bulaya aaya hai.
868,All worth the effort!,"The place has been developed into a good tourist slot looking into the easiness and safty of visiters. Well managed darshan. With Katra railway line, it is very easy for all ages to reach the temple."
869,Always rejuvenating!!,"I went with my wife in the last week of may 2019 along with my wife and 15 years old son. We started at 9 pm from Katra, it was bit crowdy, on the same pathway horses, palki wala were going up and down. Throughout the way it is well lit and they have covered the way at moat of the places to save people from rolling down stones from hills. It was my wish to visit Mata ji ka Darwar. Mata made my wish come true and I am very happy."
870,Pilgrimage,Suprbbbb experience nice & cool weather Little bit difficult for small children & old age to go with out any help
871,Fast developing holy town...,"We had to take a horse late evening as our helicopter ride was cancelled. The trekking path is well lit and the facilities are good all along the path. It takes about four hours to reach Bhawan from Katra, We had booked for the morning aarti service, which was a combination of morning worship, bhajans and a religious discourse. The dharshan followed. Overall, a spiritual experience that made the difficulties tolerable."
872,must visit place,Its said if mata calls you you will be there. Travelling uphill is no small task as its a difficult track. You May take a pony or walk up as helicopter rides are for those who book early. My joy knew no bounds when I had my darshan. I have been here before and will go there again .
873,Long awaited Trip,Its said if mata calls you you will be there. Travelling uphill is no small task as its a difficult track. You May take a pony or walk up as helicopter rides are for those who book early. My joy knew no bounds when I had my darshan. I have been here before and will go there again .The pony wallas are crooks if you see there are less ponies travel a bit more and. You will find more they will try to cheat you and take advantage of your weaknesses but be firm and pay what is mentioned in the board or complain to the board
874,Religious and with Beautiful Experience at every Turn,"memorable walk , i should say scrawl . Time taking but very enjoyable trek. 14 kms , one way. Ramp, steps, dholy, pony, chopper available. Book in advance to avoid last minute rush. along with us, 70 years couple also walked. absolutely safe, very very comfortable pathway. at least one way, one should try walking.  must tell you, it is worth the walk. wonderful darshan of vibrant energy pinds."
875,Awesome temple,"The beginning of the journey as always is a challenge as seeds of doubts keep coming back and after reaching katra and trekking the challenging track of 13.5 kms when you spot the sanctum sanctum and you finally prostrate before the goddess the feeling Is out of the world and brings a culmination of a spiritual joy.One needs to be there to know & feel .......,"
876,Vaishno Devi Bhavan,you get unknown strength and inner peace after visiting this place.Although this is tiring but worth it to visit this place.
877,Yatra,"Chalo Bulawa Aaya HaiJai Mata Di! This voice at the other side of the telephone took away all my worries. I had just called to a hotel at Katra. The moment I said hello, the person at receiving end replied with Jai Mata Di. The Yatra of Maa Vaishno Devi was long overdue. Every time we planned to go, something or other used to come in the way. It is rightly said, once you have the Call of Mata, you are bound to go.As destiny would have it, I got few days holiday in a row and added few from my side and decided to go for it. The moment we announced our wish to our family members and relatives, the good wishes started pouring in. It is amazing to see the kind of waves this yatra creates. Everybody was there to advice, encourage, sharing his/her experiences as this was my first yatra to Maa Vaishno Devi. To our surprise we also got reserved birth in the Delhi-Jammu train very easily without approaching any agent (again it looked like the yatra was destined, the call had arrived). As the departure day was approaching, I found our morning-evening greetings to change from ‚ÄúNamaste‚Äù and other words to ‚ÄúJai Mata Di‚Äù. I have visited other temples as well, but the aura of this temple is different. It influences your very routine, your nature, your persona that too even before you actually reach there.Now the next job was to get a room at Katra. Katra is the nearest town and acts as a base camp for this holy yatra. It is located at an altitude of about 2500 feet above sea level and around 50 Km from Jammu.I searched on net and got a hotel in Katra. It had decent review from earlier travellers. I called up the hotel and that is how the conversation started. The moment I said hello, I heard Jai Mata Di from the other side. After having few exchanges of information, the room was booked. I also got some useful information about the present weather etc from this gentleman. He also advised us to start the yatra in the night itself, which we very obediently followed once we reached there.Ultimately the day arrived when we (me, my wife and my 6 years old son) were in the Delhi-Jammu train. The train was decent and pretty clean. Most of the fellow travellers were also going for the Darshan. Occasionally there was chanting of mantras, sound of some devotional songs, coming from the neighbouring compartments.  Delhi to Jammu is around 580 km. We reached in the evening around 5 o‚Äô clock to Jammu railway station. I wanted to go to Katra by train as I wanted to experience the recently built Jammu-Katra railway route. But the last train had already gone. We had the typical evening tea at a Dhaaba and started from Jammu to Katra in a taxi. .  The whole route was filled with nature‚Äôs beauty. The elderly person who was driving the vehicle was very nice and kept on telling about the places coming in the route. As the evening was passing, the colours of distant mountains were also changing and different shades were appearing on the canvas of sky. There is no doubt that God has gifted whole heartedly to this part of our lovely country. Being the early April, the weather was pleasant and not very cold. It took around one and half hour, we reached to our hotel at Katra, took little rest and decided to start the yatra in the night itself.One important activity that one has to undertake on reaching Katra is getting registered for the Yatra. Yatra registration is carried out at the Yatri Registration counter (YRC) near the Bus Stand Katra.I had taken the yatra parchi on-line so was a bit relaxed. We remembered Maa Vaishno devi and started our journey.. There is no need to worry for the journey in the night as the yatra continues throughout 24 hrs. The path is well lit, there are plenty of shops which remain open and you can find plenty of people preferring to go in the night as it protects from the heat of the sun during the day.The temple is around 14 Km from Katra. There are ponies, Palanquins and Pitthu available. One can also avail the Helicoptor services from Katra. No doubt the journey is arduous but the whole track seems to be filled with blessings of mother goddess and keeps you energetic. You will find some devotees going for darshana by rolling on the ground.  We were worried about our son and asked him several times for taking the Pitthu but he flatly refused and kept walking with us. The whole path is very well lit and has facilities for drinking water, toilets. The mountains were looking much beautiful in the night lights. We could hear many languages spoken by the people passing by, exchanging smiles and above all saying ‚ÄúJai Mata Di‚Äù to each other. You will also notice many of the Pitthus and porters, helping the pilgrims are Muslims, another example of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood in our country. It is amazing, people from different states, casts, creeds; languages were having the same flame in their hearts and moving on. A vibrant, mini India was just floating bonded by a sacred thread of faith and devotion. The slopes of the path were not only moving us upward from sea level, but also were elevating every one spiritually.  We reached to the Bhawan around 2 am. It took some time in the queue for the cloak room to keep our luggage and bathing and then we were there in the queue for the Darshana. It was start of the Chaitra Navratra and had huge rush of devotees. The queue was moving very slowly. After passing by the railings, corridor, stairs, finally the moment came and we could get the Darshana. It was a divine feeling. The security personnel were very promptly managing the heavy rush and asking the devotees to move fast. It was just for few moments, we could get the glimpse of the Mata. The thirst for seeing some more, were holding our feet but we had to move on for our fellow devotees. When we reached back, the tiredness of the journey had started showing the effects. Surprisingly me & my wife were dead tired but my son, for whom we were worried, was still in playing mood. The very first activity he did was, to switch on the TV and the favourite cartoon channel started showing up. We did not know when the sleep overpowered our body and we surrendered. When I got up, the TV was still on. Suddenly I saw my cell phone; there were missed calls from the office. I said, come on my boy It is time to say goodbye to heaven and return to earthly pleasures, The sound of the alarm clock, the lunch box, the commute to office, the boss, the colleagues, the clients............."
878,Mata Vaishno Devi,"Even though its bliss to visit a temple after all the hardships we face all along, I was saddened by the way people are looted in each and every step at Katra and Maa Vaishno Devi.We took helicopter to Sanjichet to and fro and walked to the Bhavan from heliped. While returning back, we wanted to take pony via bhairon temple to helipad. The rate on board for pony is 275. On one of the boards, the number is scratched off and pony wallahs argue that the rate is 575. The price is visible on the other board, but they argue that 275 is for bhavan to Sanjichet even though the board clearly says Bhavan to Sanjichet via Bhairon temple. Worse is there is no one from the Vaishnodevi trust available at the pony stand to whom we can complain and pony wallahs take advantage of it.At the helipad, there is some mafia of the helicopter guys where they take more money from people who directly book there and they are boarded before the people who have booked online. They make you wait for almost 2 hours if you have online booking.Autowallas charge hell even for smaller distance. There is no fixed priceThe guy who dropped us from hotel to Jammu airport started a big fight telling that toll fare was not part of the price we initially agreed upon. Since the cab I booked was through hotel guy, I had to call the hotel guy to convince the driver about the agreement and even then, there were a lot of curses thrown by the driver (which we truly did not even care)I agree tourism is bread and butter for all the people in Katra, but that does not mean they have the liberty to loot the devotees. The trust has to regularize all the fare and have to deploy people to make sure every body adheres to it and dont cheat the devotees."
879,Well managed pilgrimage site,Well maintained and clean. Felt the inner peace while climbing. Things well organized. The temple trust should have a better system for the pony rides.
880,Jai Mata Di !,"epitome of religion , peace and blessings. gr8 journey leaves u in bliss. well maintained n developed"
881,Jai Mata Di- a Pilgrimage to Mata Vaishno Devi.,I'm going here from childhood times till now best place to get peace purify soul when u enter darbar u feel fully spiritual apne app hi apke dil se awaz aahti hai jai mata di har aahta jahta insan jab apko jai mata di kehta hai sachi dil ch josh aah jahta hai trekking ka which 14 km from entry point till darbar or wahn jah ke ache darshn karne ke baad wahn ke bhojanlaye main rajma chawal kahne ka joh maja aahta hai or chole bature khane wasa kahi nhi aahta or raste while trekking joh paan ke paate per home made kulfi milti cut cut ke piece main awesome white colour ki rabdi type kulfi ka swad hi wakra hai or fruit chat or keera n mooli chat ke big pieces n kale chole sab vaishno devi ke Rasta main milte hain don't miss all this asa taste or kahi nhi milta
882,Must visit.. ,"Shrine board are big looters. The donation they are receiving and the money they have right now, they can make marbel road from Jammu to Mata rani darbaar. But still the stairs, roads are broken. We go by bare feet and its real hard to manage. There was power outage and it was completely dark. No lights for 30-45 minutes.Only attraction was our Mata Rani üëèüëèüëè"
883,Jai mata dii,The best place to visit and go lost in the spiritual magic. Though it was quite tough for we people to walk like for an hour so still it was worth it. You forget all your worries and all you come back with is so many memories. Love this place!
884,Jai Mata Di,"I am not sure I need to say much about shrine itself. It gives a lot of peace. About facilities, the room reservation system needs improvement on the portal. You really can not get the room booked online."
885,Place Where Your Soul meets the God,Man se mangi gayi murad poori karti hai maiya. The facilities provided by Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board is awesome. Only thing which has to be improved is staying facility at bhawan. Otherwise excellent.
886,Jai Mata Di - Katra,"Visited in June .. unfortunately during summer vacation time. Heavy rush... scarcity of rooms/water.. worst condition of toilets available on the way from adhkunwari till bhawan.. Only thing to give comfort was the darshan in bhawan(for 1 sec) at around 4 in the morning and nearby 'Shiv cave'.. Don't think for a later time as queue will be of kms long.New way from katra to adhkunwari , although long, but in much better condition than older one. Not much refreshment points but tasty 'kadhi rice' /'rajma rice'/'curd rice' is available there..less steep, easier to walk due to shades on top and clean.Less crowdy as compared to older route as many people don't take this one.During heavy rush, you can forget about visiting 'adkunwari cave'.For four of us.. it was 3 days wait!!!(We were on 2 day trip only).Try visiting Bhaironath temple after 8:30 am in morning as heavy and pushing crowd with no sense of queue will be there till 8:30 am to scare you with thought of stampede!!!!My experience... don't go without booking rooms in adhkunwari/bhawan.Try to freshen up as early as possible .. to get less crowded open bathing ghat(you can forget about cleanliness).Try to be in locker queue as early as possible.. so you can do 'darshan' early."
887,Great trek and view with a visit to a temple,Excellent service of helicopter infact on the way back the weather wasn't good we had to wait for 2 hrs then the service started.
888,A journey to the home of Goddess!!,"The route, 12 km long one way, is well lit, covered and is hustling and bustling with people and vendors. The temple is beautiful and completely worth the effort put into getting there by foot. A must visit, at least once in a lifetime."
889,Great temple well managed,We went with our entire extended family including 70-80+ parents and kids and with some friends. When we started the climb up it felt like a treacherous trek up since it started raining profusely! Luckily we sent or parents and kids on horses while we walked up in the pouring rain. Since every possible accommodation was overbooked cos if the rain we had to immediately start our trek back down the same night after Mata's darshan. Thankfully no one got sick or experienced any health issues after undertaking such a long and difficult trek. Guess Devi's blessings were with us! One lesson learnt is not to do Vaishnodevi during monsoon...
890,Beautiful Cave. Jai Mata Di.,It's difficult and risky to visit in rainy days...  Risk to give up life there...  Will suggest don't travel with family
891,Jai Mata Di,"Spiritual magic. The area is very well managed by shrine board. Washrooms and cloak room lines need to be better managed in the whole area. Otherwise small eateries especially the ccd, sagar ratna, nestle, nescafe are very good. This place is eternal, magical and spiritual."
892,it is just supreme,Its an experience one must undertake. The journey itself is amazing inspite of the steep walk on the mountain. But once you reach you feel so ecstatic.
893,Jai mata di,Superb locationBeautiful sceneriesAwesome helipad journeyGood maintenanceHad Aatki Aarti Darshan at EveningParadise on EarthNo words to sayLife time memorable darshan
894,Holy Divine ,Awesome experience.  Try to take the new pathway while going up. It is cleaner and better with snack corners n clean toilets every 0.5kmsTry to start early so that you can avoid the post 4pm rush.
895,Jai Mata Di!,"Amazing trip , appreciate cleanliness maintained and sanitation amenities.  Throughout the passage is concrete with well covered roof which makes walk very pleasant."
896,Jai Mata Di..,Jai Mata Di !!!Great place!!! The facilities like food and shelter are awesome here though it's a hill station. Shrine board is managing very efficiently and keeps improving the facilities and infrastructure according to the demands of pilgrims. Every visit to here becomes nothing less than awesome.
897,Devi Darshan,Calm..relaxed environment and just chill. Book your stay and taxi beforehand to avoid overpricing. For security try avoiding using two wheeler as liquor is cheaper and sometimes people drive insanely. Roads are narrow but smooth.carry medicine kit as very limited medical shops. Beleza was a nice stay with private beach.
898,Great Service by Shirne Board,"An enchanting journey to the holy shrine... its okay if you can walk the whole distance... but don't over-strain yourself... for horse rides and palkis you need to bargain a lot, or they tend to cheat you... or else take the helicopter"
899,Devotion cum refreshing trip,"Visited the Shrine after 30 years with the same college friends....So much has changed, it's better organized. We took a helicopter ride till Sanjhi chaat and then walked to the Mandir..Book the helicopter beforehand only...The experience of being there is something which is difficult to describe.. You have to be there to feel it.. Pure Bliss.."
900,MY FAV PLACE,"There is so much information is available on Vaishno Devi, yet it is not enough. Hence, this piece ...PreparationGetting the general check-up especially blood sugar level, blood pressure is beneficial. If walking is not a part of daily routine, it is better to start walking a week before.  FootwearThe pathway to Vaishno Devi temple is tiled and sloped. Yet normal walking shoes of any company (Nike, Reebok, Puma etc.) are required. The new shoes had to be worn fifteen days before and practiced. The shoe required to be worn with a pair of socks as they keep feet dry and warm. DressThe best dress for Vaishno Devi is Salwar and Kameez. A sweater or warm clothing depends on the season of your travel is required. YatraAll yatras whether by walk or helicopter have to be registered at the base with an ID. Helicopter RideHelicopter Ride could be booked online but had to be done 2-3 months before and you may not get for all the members or for both to and fro rides. The open-secret is anything is possible if you pay money through the guides. Even when you choose Helipad, you may have to walk about 2.5km to reach the temple. Walk from helipad to the temple is easier than from temple to the helipad as the slope is downward.From Helipad there are 'Dolis' and horses are available. However, they do not go near to the temple and stop a km away from the temple. Where you can deposit all your valuables and other leather items like big bags, mobiles, cameras including iwatches etc. in the locker or the guide will help you to do that. You will be frisked at four to five places. Horsemen and DolliwallahsHorsemen and Doliwallahs are not just nuisances like in any tourist center but also know how to divert your attention and cheat you. A few ways of their cheating:1. They agree for the amount prescribed by the temple authority but demand ‚ÄòBhakshees‚Äô 2. When you are discussing with your family members they interfere and do not allow you complete the conversation and create confusion. 3. The Dolli-man rushes and brings you before your other members of the group and demands to pay. Don‚Äôt mind collect again your charge second time from others if you are not alert When you go in a group it is better one person handle the amount and decide on the Dolli-man or horseman for the whole group. This would make your yatra safe and satisfying, Jai Mata di ..."
901,religious place,Awesome place for a change from the monotonous 9 to 5 job. But the trek from katra to the top can be tiring. Its adventurous though. Keep saying jai mata di and you will eventually reach the top.
902,"""Jai Mata Di""",I was there in April end 2018. This is definitely a great to be there if you keep faith on God. Your entire tiredness will go off once you have a beautiful view of the Holy Cave. This is something can't be described in words but you will love it.
903,Peaceful,A must visit for any religious person. Nicely maintained by the shrine board. The mules are a nuisance though
904,Very Nice,"I am neither dedicated devotee nor atheist. We may be sincere devotee, but must be aware about the facts and figures, history, current conditions etc. Consider following facts before going for obeisance to Maata. 1. Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board of the temple has an annual income of around Rs 500 crore. 2. The Governor of the State of Jammu and Kashmir is Chairman of the Board, and nine board members are nominated by the Governor of J&K. 3. Original holy cave with original pindies is closed. New tunnels having replica of original pindies is there. Do you want to see replicas?4. You can enjoy walking, ponies or take new route. You will hardly get helicopter tickets. Otherwise either book in two months advance or be a very senior govt. official with a letter from your officer to shrine board. Waiting place for helicopter flight is simply shabby. Two helicopter agencies ply and each take more than 100 sorties per day, accommodation five to six passenger per sortie. Marvellous time management for each sortie by these agencies.5. If you are going only as a tourist, sincere advice will be that there are many better places to visit. 6. On the way there are scenic views but not much praise worthy.7. If you don‚Äôt wish to be part of crowd, please don‚Äôt go. Even if you have a priority slip issued for both way helicopter ticket holders, govt. officials etc. it may take hours.8. If still you are not being part of Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan or have recently joined it, you can use toilets. Bathrooms are no better than toilets. Astonishingly, for such a rich temple, toilets/ bathrooms should be neat, clean and of modern standards. 9. Eateries are more than crowded. Quality of food.. unsure. Here or there people stranding, unclean dirty pathway, passing through narrow enclosure does not give a feeling to going to a holy place for peace. First and foremost question arises that why a temple where crore of devotees visits and have one of the highest incomes is not providing decent amenities to devotes, leave aside world class or state of the art amenities. It is not that this is not possible. Those who have seen Vatican City, may understand. Mismanagement or organised chaos, is not only prevalent at Vaishn Devi, it is at most of our religious place. Fund availability has never been an issue. People are willing to provide fund in various forms for making darshan in a better way. Even ropeway has not been created till date. The reason is never cited or elucidated.  We should be educated enough to not get exploited due to our spirituality and religiousness."
905,Religious place - Vaishno devi,"A trek to get a glimpse of the tri-deity nestled in the valley of the Trikuta mountains near Katra, J&KThe trek seems strenous but once you end, all ur tiredness goes off you feel relaxed. Loads of shops including ones authorised by the Shrine Board are available offering food and soft drinks to ease ur trekThe entire temple is managed by Shrine Board which offers excellent facilities to all pilgrims.Those who prefer walking upto the temple, can check out the route for battery cars which does not allow horses, ponies on the rote, the route is shorter and we could end up in 3:15 hrs."
906,Want to know about vaishnavi bhawan??,Nothing like this place ever. Since im writing a review about this place so i would mention that place is clean and shop there are bit high priced.And if you are carrying a baby with you please get a cart on rent from baanganga itself.
907,Jai Mata Di,"The very first step in the holy town KATRA gives you the devine feeling. Get yourself registered to the trip as soon as you reach Katra, Token is FREE Nd is available at Railway station Nd Bus stand.  I being a first timer didn‚Äôt knew about it nd had to walk back 2kms. Security is superb, specially of the 9th Battalion CRPF, soldiers on duty are too very helpful. A nice up slope walk is a challenge, horses,palki n pitthu are available, but negotiate the rates before hand. But nothing comparable to walk, I took 3hrs 15mns till the Bhavan, after the Darshan walk till BHARAOJI is the most difficult, a 2.5kms rout takes around one hrs walk. It‚Äôs a devine feel to complete the trip, feel blessed to have done this Darshan. Jai MataJi üôè"
908,our visit to Vaishno Devi,"Spiritual bliss, the arrangements by the shrine board is excellent, friendly for senior citizens as well"
909,Trip to Vaishno Devi Mandir,It's just when mata calls you then only you are there... simply lucky to be in main Mandir for almost 5 mins with nobody around in 5 degrees chilling at 2.00 am... feels great and fresh.. once in a lifetime for a Hindu to go...
910,love this place,What can one say as a review of the most revered holy shrine of the country? Helicopter is difficult unless booked weeks in advance. Rates for ponies and palanquin are put up on the shrine notice board. There's no cheating whatsoever. Battery operated cars can also be used but only half way between
911,mind blowing place,"Worshipping should be peaceful but this is not the case here. Everyone charges their own price for horses and it depends on your size. There is not ample food places after the halfway point so be prepared. When you get to the top, there is a massive queue to get into the temple and the police will only let you pray for one second. Furthermore there is a lot of litter. Don't wast your time."
912,"Devi Durga, Laxmi and Saraswati resides here as Vaishnodevi....","As the saying goes ... you can visit this place only if Mata calls you ... so we were lucky enough  to get the chance ( mata ka bulava ) .. we visited the temple / Bhawan in the first week of July and it was raining heavily the day we visited ... we had booked the helicopter but the flights got cancelled due to bad weather and we had to walk the entire 28kms up / down ( as chose not to take horses or palki etc ) .. we completed the trek it in about 13 hours ( we were quite slow mainly due to my wife‚Äôs knee injury generally this distance can be done in 8 to 9 hours ) ... but it was all worth it ... this was my 5th visit and every time I come here i feel blessed and want to come again and again . Writing down some points that would help the people who r planning to visit he temple : How to reach : You can reach Katra ( the base camp city ) by rail , or road from Jammu or other cities ... it‚Äôs very well connected by road and rail network that has also improved a lot recently  . About the Climb : you must take the Yatra prachi at the starting point of the climb which is free but mandatory without that they won‚Äôt allow you to enter the main temple .. so DONOT MiSS the YATRA PARCHI ....there are 3 different ways / roads that are available ... 1. Helicopter : one has to book it at least two months b4 the travel due to heavy rush , helicopter takes you till Sanchi chat and one has to climb around 2 to 3 km only from there to the Bhawan ... but even after booking ... the flight depends upon weather condition ( in our case we had the bookings but it got cancelled due to bad weather ) DO carry the print of the ticket so as to take the Stamp from the office in case it gets cancelled for your refund .. 2. the new road : was opened to general Yatris but unfortunately now closed due to horse union objection / court stay as the new road doesn‚Äôt allow horses , it permits only yatris  who want to climb on foot or electric vehicles ... hence they are asking for rehabilitation... 3. the older route : open since years ... on this route one has various options  : walking , Horses , Palki , electric vehicles ( again depend upon weather conditions ) ... the rates for various modes are attached in the pictures ... apart from this there are Pitthus available that can carry your luggage so you don‚Äôt have to carry weight or even kids up to 25kgs and than there are men available with Prams who help you to take / push your infants or smaller kids all the way to Bhawan and back ... the entire yarta generally takes about 8 to 9 hours on foot ( if you r physically fit ) with 2 major stops for food ... ( in our case it took 13 hours mainly due to my wife‚Äôs knee injury ... ) facilities along the way : The entire stretch is covered with Shops , eatery‚Äôs , Med  stores , electronic massage chairs , rest rooms , washrooms , emergency first aid and also doctor on help ( for emergencies) ... name it and it‚Äôs available along the way ... Few points to take care : if you r going in winters do carry winter clothing it gets really cold on top , if you are booking helicopter that you get the vip ticket for Puja which otherwise you have to take separately , onion , garlic , liquor, cigs are not allowed on the trek ... Jai Mata di"
913,Sacche Darbaar ki Jai,"From a traveler point of view this place at the begin of the summit is a bit crowded but it thins out as you start climbing uphill. The path at places has got mule droppings thus I suggest wear good shoes. It's a challenging hike if you're out of shape or old but for a fairly fit person it's absolutely tiring and beautiful.From a Pilgrim's point of view, this is one of the holiest treks of Hinduism, as soon as you enter the cave , start praying, because of the crowd restrictions pundit(priest) asks people to rush a bit. I was lucky to have a proper long darshan because pundit was really nice that day . It's absolutely beautiful and the pilgrimage gives you a very holy and pious feel.They offer at the bottom of the summit, khacchar(Mules) and Palaki for you to ride to the top or halfway, don't forget to negotiate if you're taking them."
914,Best place to go if your want to meet Mata,"This place is such a beautiful place I ever seen before ,there is some kind of energy you can feel it , there is no tieredness to climb 14 km from katra market ,this is such a devote place I love the place"
915,Spiritual Place,It was really a wonderful feeling. Something which can not be expressed in words. A must visit place for all who believe in God. Please visit Vaisnav Devi at least once in your lifetime. It gives an special power in your body and increases your self confidence. Jai mata di.
916,"The Greatest Holiest temple of Hindus but not  recommended in may & jun because maonagement not take care ,Not organise","Shri Mata Vaishno Devi is located on the Trikuta Hills in the state of Jammu & Kashmir. The main temple colloquially known as Bhawan is located at 5200ft above msl. The distance is approx 12 to 13 kms walk. The other modes available are helicopter service for which online booking should be done min 30 - 40 days in advance, Porter, Pony and Palki. At the start one needs to Register at the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board counters and obtain Yatra slip (Parchi), There are many places of religious significance enroute starting with Banganga, Charan Paduka, Ardhkuwari, Himkoti, Sanjhichhat before reaching Bhawan. Of late an alternate route skirting Ardhkuwari, Himkoti and Sanji Chhat has been created. Enroute there are many pilgrim facilities established like refreshment centres, medical facilities, toilets and almost the entire route has been covered to provide shelter to pilgrims while undertaking the journey.At the temple The Goddess has manifested in to three Holy pindies (rock form) of Mata Maha Saraswati, Mata Maha Lakshmi and Mata Maha Kali and there are no statues. After visit to bhawan, it is generally accepted that visit is incomplete if one does not visit the Bhairon Ghati where a temple in honour of Bhairon has been established."
917,Lucky to be there,At this place you will get Inner Peace.Amazing viewsLots of things to buySacred placeHelicopter ride
918,Devotion at its peak. Eternal Peace,"If you wish to attain peace and want to be calm and relax, do visit this place. There are always a lot of people there so plan it well in advance,"
919,Spiritual Place,"Very well managed by the board and well protected by our defence services. Best time to go is all the years except rainy season. Dont carry extra baggage. Wear sports shoes, dont carry anything as every essential item is available everywhere be it food, water others things. Follow the rules & instruction of security forces. Dharamshals, lodge, hotel etc available in all ranges you can chose as per your budget. Still advance booking is the best options I can advice. Keep travelling & enjoy your trip‚Ä¶.. Jai Mata Di !!!!!!"
920,Very good experience,Great trip enjoyed a lot. Soothing environment because of its greenery and nice place to visit with family and friends.
921,Mata Darshan,"I don't need anything to justify the worth of visiting the place. The entire stretch from Katra to Ardhakumari to Mata's temple will energize u a lot. Even if u are going by walk, u will feel that some power gives u energy to move forward. Everybody must visit it at least once in his life."
922,Sanctified..!!,Either climb  the mountain on foot for 3-4 hrs or take pony/ horse ride or helicopter to reach the main temple Vaishno Devi . u ve to climb further 30-45 mins for bhairavnath . they say ur yatra is incomplete if u dont visit here . either going back or coming first midway is garab gufa [ cliff ] its a nice experience and difficult to go through it but lot of people help u crawl from here
923,Super place in all over india,This is a place where I love to visit as many times as possible. The atmosphere with overall facilities is so nice that you sometimes get confused whether it is a pilgrimage or a tourist spot for enjoyment/amusement..Must visit.
924,Pilgrimage: Mata Vaishno Devi,"If you want to plan to go for a tour then I would like to tell you to go a dream place vaishno devi maa mandir in katra jammu. There are lot of things like hotels, parkings servcies, bhandaras and etc. More for your desire.  Local sight seeing: there is one of the awesome site for tour and for enjoyment and worship of goddess maa vishno devi.  There has strict security for passengers and visitors police and army always there for our help."
925,Awesome,"Loved those trails, shops, horses and the Shrine board is doing a great job now. Visit anytime with friends/family or even solo."
926,Divine ,"We booked the helicopter in both directions through the official website. If one has booked through the agent, they will have tough time to take the helicopter. The original Debit / Credit card must be shown and in case they get a doubt, they will ask for the pin etc. If one books up & Down tickets, VIP Entry pass will be given for Darshan. That makes easy for devotees. From Sanjichat one has to walk for 3.5 kms to reach Bhawan, That is easy, but to go back to Sanjichat helipad from Bhavan is steep up and tough, advisable to go by horse (Rs200/-- per head)."
927,Religious & peaceful place,Simply awesome.Great place of devotion.Every facility is available.Good security.Food joints available.
928,A spiritual journey,"I have been regular visitors for years. This time, going through the claims at aite, we chose the new tarakote marg from ardhkuwari while returning after darshan.but it was terrible. There are no regular shops. Eating joints are placed at quite a distance with only few eating choices. Out of the new water dispensers placed many were not working.Midway the electricity went off and it was too dark without a sign of light...All pilgrims had to use their mobile torch. There was a medical urgency and it was too difficult to find people to help as only few pilgrims were there. Ambulance reached quite late. People had to forcly stop a vehicle to take the patient to nearby medical centre. However, medical centre took care very well. Ambulance man also helped . Later we learned the path is longer by 2 kms than regular path. At the end of the path very few autos were available.also it is around 4 km away from the bus stand/market where generally people stay.Overall NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL. Take the regular path inspite of troubling ponies."
929,Great,"The staff is the key point. Super cooperative. Cool, calm and make you feel at home. Food in all outlets is excellent."
930,Place,This Temple is above being reviewed. There is something that pulls you to It. It is Most Holy. You will be Blessed to Have Matajis Darshan. Hope you Get your Bulawa soon. :)
931,Great climb and breath taking views from the Bhawan,"They will not book good hotel rooms for you. Not worth for your money if they book hotels. If you have any plan change in your trip also they will not consider, but initially they will say you can change and all. Even that travel vehicle they will show is not same what you get it. If pickup time at airport is 2.30pm means driver come early and put vehicle in parking and asks us to pay 1000 bucks horrible experience which we had. If you travels with baby's they will park vehicles in some place and ask us to come to that parking place, that means you have to walk from where they left you something like shopping and you have to call them and you have to go to their place they will not come and terribly you have to pay parking also. If they booked rooms we have to wait until the rooms get vacated. Overall worst experience with this RAO travels. Guys don't ever choose this. Worst ever experienced. I don't have zero rating to give."
932,God place,Most Devine place with a mix of nature and spirituality.All months are suitable but you need to have a postpaid sim because prepaid cards have no signal in whole state.Book Yatra ticket online and if you are too sick to climb 14 km up the Trikuta hill you can book a helicopter for only Rs 1077 per trip per head from the website of the management trust.
933,Holistic and beautiful,"Use the new route.. well laid out road and covers.. you walk in the shade, which is good as you can walk up during the day. Carry am ID proof with you. Lots of tea/ coffee stations on the way. The walk is almost 15k one way.. not very steep. Very much doable.the temple is beautiful... go when there is not much rush i.e on weekdays and away from the festive seasons."
934,JAI MATA DI,Jai mata di . Really one of the holiest place i have ever visited . any one who didn't have faith in god will definitely start believing god after visiting here . the place is in very high altitude . No difference of Day and night . Every one is as safe in night as safe they are in day time .
935,Divine and heavenly.,"I'm not a very religious person, but would still recommend visiting this place. The shrine board staff is really humble and you can have food at various places at dirt cheap prices. The location is amazing with hills and valleys all around"
936,Vaishno Devi,"There is no secret ingredient. All things and power lies within us. You will be called for the visit of Maa Vaishnodevi temple. I was fortunate to complete the Yatra with my wife and it gave us immense satisfaction.It took around 5 hrs to complete our Yatra and after Darshan, we visited Bhairon to complete the journey. I strongly recommend everyone to visit this place in his life.Jai Mata Di..."
937,Amazing holy place,"All I can say is. Chalo Bulawa Aaya Hai, Mata Ne Bulaya Hai!! Jai Mata Di...An opportunity for every devotee to visit this amazing temple, don't miss it. It's an experience you won't forget in the hurry. The mountainous views, the beautiful trees, the blue skies, and most importantly, the feeling of divine presence all around you. It is all a matter of faith and the 14km trek to the temple, the whole trecky you dont feel tired or loose. Every one keep you enerzise. Beautiful place, wonderful experience.Amazing Maintance by shrine board"
938,Goddess in Shrine.,Travelled during the month of March 2017. Very very cold. Really unbearable. A bit of snow and rain.
939,Blissful place ,"Vaishno Devi Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu Mother Goddess Mahalakshmi, located in Katra at the Trikuta Mountains within the Indian state of J & K. The temple is surrounded by hills and nature give peace to soul and mind."
940,Visit for darshan for Maa Vaishno Devi,"Spiritual heaven. Amazing to see how neat and clean the place has been kept now. Year earlier, the entire path was lined with baggers all the way till Bhavan. Now its pristine, facilities all along the way , eating places, resting places, and Ponys as well as carts available"
941,We plan in July end,"A 13 km trek or a 5 min helicopter ride or a pony ride or maybe a palanquin takes you to the cave shrine of the Divine Mother Vaishno Devi.The long queues are very disciplined n individuals are not allowed to carry their mobiles, leather goods n bags.Lockers are available free of cost close by n photography is definitely not permitted!!"
942,A must visit place in Jammu,"such a holly place to visit  which still mesmerises me,millions of peolpe flock to it every year, its a 14 km yatra,now new Tarakote Marg is opened for devotees Banganga and Adhkuwari to decongest the rush of pilgrims on the existing 6 km  pony-free route from Katra to Bhawan.do take this rout in your next visit,,"
943,interesting,"I have to start by saying that this review is my personal experience and personal opinion about the place. It is a review of the 'place' and the entities who manage this place. I mean no disrespect for Mataji or I do not question anyone's faith in her. I visited this place in July 2017 and I was DISAPPOINTED. Let me start with the helicopter ride. I understand that the helicopter can only work weather permitting but the service is grossly mismanaged. There is no proper communication provided to travelers and the people behind the counter get to make the decision who flies and who does not. When we reached the helicopter service office, we were told that the choppers were not flying due to bad weather. We were made to wait from 10 am to 3 pm and then they cancelled our tickets. This was a huge waste of time as if we knew we were not going to fly we could have started proceeding towards Bhavan much earlier than 4 pm. There were no clear instructions given and our time was wasted. Once it was decided that we were not going to fly, we decided to proceed to Banganga to hire a pony. The rickshaw ride to Banganga was Rs. 300 for 3 kilometers. The people just extort money out of you at every step of the way. Once we reached Banganga we were ambushed by horsemen. 10-15 of them ran towards us and started negotiating the rates with us. The published rate is Rs.700 per horse. We paid Rs. 4000 for 3 horses. The vendors were fighting among each other and one of them lifted an put my nephew on a horse. My nephew was petrified and started crying. As we started our journey the other vendors that we did not hire were hurling abuses at us. The horse ride was not comfortable but it was better than walking. I don't want to say anything negative about the horses or the people who care for them as they are just doing their jobs. The rode is very sleek especially during rains , it is dirty, with lot of littering around but this is typical of any pilgrimage in India. People just don't respect their surroundings and environment. There are restroom facilities available all throughout the road, but don't expect them to be clean. EVERYTHING smells like Urine. I don't blame anyone else but people who use it. We reached Bhavan at 7:00pm and it closed for Aarti. So we had to wait for two hours and finally finished our darshan at 10 pm. The road from Bhavan to actual Shrine is very narrow, it is hard to walk on and they won't let you wear shoes. I personally think this can be managed better considering the amount of money this shrine makes. The pujari in the mandir is very rude and he bangs your head against the stone whether you like it or not. After enduring the road for 3 hours, standing in a queue for 3 hrs. we were inside the temple for less than 3 mins. The temple it self is very peaceful and you feel very peaceful after the darshan.  After we were done, we had to fight again with a few people before we decided on horses. Again we paid Rs. 1100 per horse. By the time we got back to the hotel it was 4:00am. I am glad we did but I am glad this is over. I was not impressed by the so called, 'organized, clean ' claims that people have made in their reviews.  The place is pretty chaotic and dirty. I pray that Mataji give the shrine board more strength to make things better. Jai Mata Di!"
944,An Important religious for Hindus,"Simply awesome.....you can feel the spirituality in the air. Views are breath taking once you reach the temple. Sudden formation of the cloud is amazing. Once you start from BanGanga, there itself you start enjoying the journey. Don't miss to visit BhairoNath."
945,Nice sight seeing,After a long walk when you enter the Temple complex you feel your energy coming back to your body. The main temple is well maintained and truly appealing and when you actually reach the main area one would be surprised o find the simplicity of MATA
946,An Important pilgrimage for Hindus,Loved the trek up to the temple and enjoyed the food shacks on our way up. The food at ardhkuwari is great everyone should try Kadi Chawal. Places to stay when you reach up is good and the whole thing is organized very well. Most of the booking can be done online and you can always get lot of information on line.
947,"we visited in the end of May, 2016","It is said that until the Deity calls you, you can never reach here. I have been blessed to have undertaken this pilgrimage several times in my life.We have so far always done the Yatra on foot which has been a pleasure. This time around I found that it was possible to book the Atka Aarti online, which we did and had splendid Darshans! The path to Bhawan from Ardhkumari has an added Mule free track which makes the climb easier. On the way back we took an unplanned Helicopter ride. Luckily the tickets were available and the ride back was a swift couple of minutes."
948,Mata Vaisnav Devi Pilgrimage,It may be off the beaten path for some but this road to the million year old cave has been traveled by millions of people over generations. Definitely a power spot and must be experienced to be appreciated.
949,Holy & enjoyable trip,A religious place. Good for family outing. There are options for several home stays and budgeted hotels.
950,Jai Mata Ji! Divine experience..Jammu to Katra,"It was a very good experience for the whole family and we had a memorable time here.Depending on your physical and financial capability, you can choose to reach the temple either by walk, palki, pony or helicopter+walk.  If you choose to use the helicopter services, I suggest you book it online at least few weeks in advance as there are limited seats.If you are planning to visit Amarnath cave as well, I suggest you visit Vaishno devi first, and then the Amarnath cave.  Reason is, I liked Vaishno devi visit very much, but Amarnath trip was much more awesome."
951,Temples with lot of blessings and peace,"Historically speaking, when it comes to spiritual awakening and guidance, India is the place to be in. Dotted with numerous shrines, this is a land where the world's oldest religion was founded and is still practiced with almost the same old faith and tradition as it used to be thousands of years ago. Now, if you wish to experience that first hand, there are very few places as good as or better than the Vaishno Devi temple. This is a beautiful temple situated at the top of a hill which once used to be very difficult to reach. Recognizing the tourism that the location can generate, the govt. along with the Shrine board that runs the temple has constructed broad footpaths with occasional stairs so that the visitors can easily reach the temple. The journey starts from Banganga. Before that one has to collect the receipt of journey Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board office near Katra bus stand. At Banganga, one should i deally decide whether one would walk the distance or take a pony/horse/mule to cover the distance of roughly 14 kms to reach the temple. One may also avail paalkis which are each carried by 4 men on their shoulders with the person on-board. The cost of the services taken definitely depends a lot  upon the amount of bargaining that one can do. The journey is usually tiresome and due to the high altitude one may feel very fatigued. There are pitstops at Charan Paduka, Adhkuwari, Himkoti, Sanjichhat, Bhawan. At Bhawan you have the temple of the Mother Goddess. Generally there would be huge queue. There is provision for keeping the shoes and other valuables for which one will be provided with a locker. You may choose to take a bath as well. Apart from the main temple there is also this Ram-Sita-Hanuman temple and a Shiv temple which should visit. The darshan of Maata Vaishno Devi easily takes more than 2 hours but may take little lesser if the number of devotees are lesser than usual, especially during the heavy winters. Once done with the darshan one may collect the belongings from the aforementioned locker and move further upwards to reach the Bhairon Ghati. This is where the yatra or the sacred-travel actually ends. There is a small temple there dedicated to tantrik Bhairo Nath. According to the legends, Bhairo Nath and Maata Vaishno Devi had this battle in which Bhairo Nath was killed. Upon penance, Maata blessed him such that a temple will be built for him too and the pilgrimage will remain half-complete if the Bhairo Nath temple is not visited. Once done with this last site, one may start the journey downwards towards Banganga.PS - 1. you may avail helicopter services from Katra to Bhawan.2. people with asthma and heart ailments should strictly avoid walking. Death is not extremely rare.3. Rajma Chawal is must have on the way back. It totally energizes you. You may also try other food items. They are all strictly vegetarian or of the type - Vaishno, which I guess means devoid of onion and garlic.4. There is a Cafe Coffee Day on the path. I never entered there. Dont know if it is good or bad.5. There are local masseuses who provide good massage on the go. Can be tried.6. Not all places are well-lit. At night, please be alert as mules and horses may appear out of apparently nowhere. There has been no accident known but better to be safe than sorry.7. A new provision of small cars has been introduced for aged and handicapped people and pregnant women.8. Various hotels are available at Katra.9. visit the Vaishno Devi Shrine board official website.10. Chant Jai Maata Di."
952,SEA OF HOLINESS......DIVINITY,"How do you review a temple? It is always a matter of faith and devotion. So what I am doing here is reviewing the trek that we undertook to reach this amazing cave temple, so that fellow travelers may find some useful info while planning their own trip.We were two women - in their forties. Not too much in shape, not desperately out of shape either (hopefully)! Last long walk we had taken was approx 5 km on a flat NCR road, and that had left us tired. So we weren't sure of our abilities, nevertheless off we went.We had decided to walk all the way - in any case, I believe you should go for other options, only if you are infirm, or aged, or with young kids. And once you start - you see so many people of all shapes, sizes and ages, carrying big bags and 4 year old kids on their shoulders, that you instantly feel ashamed of even thinking that you are tired. It is challenging, but like all good things in life, the effort makes it so much more worth it.It was a spiritual journey for us, in more ways than one. We started walking at approx 12 pm. It was not too hot, though it was quite sunny at that time. We were hoping to be done and back by 1 AM latest.We carried a change of clothes and some light snacks (an energy bar, a pack of biscuits, come candy) in a small backpack. Also a (non-plastic) bottle of water in my waist-pouch, which I had planned to refill at the RO water ATM's which are installed at every .5 km on the new road.We took the new road for the uphill climb. It is easier and less slippery, though you end up walking almost 3 extra km. At our pace, that was more than an hour extra. The walkway is covered at most places, but the initial couple of km's were under the noon sun. Also, there was no electricity for most of the walk, which meant that the water ATM's had run out of water. So we were forced to buy a disposable water bottle on the way. (Learning - pack 2 bottles instead of 1)The initial climb was the hardest - then we got in a rhythm, and moved slowly, but steadily. We reached the bhawan by approx 8 pm.By the time darshan was done, and we started on the downhill walk, it was after 11 pm. I took a Combiflam before starting back (highly recommended). Coming back was faster but also harder on the knees. We took the older route, since we wanted to save time. This route is also more lively, with horses crossing you non-stop. We had to stop lots of times to let horses pass. We walked without breaks on the way back, and finally reached Banganga at 4 am. Coming back is easier since it is all downhill, and weather was pleasant. We had gone in early October, and we needed just a light jacket. I had also packed a cap, but did not need to use it. Some notes:- A stick is a must-buy and a life saver on the trek. You easily get cheap sticks when you start walking - you can also return them when you come back.- It is very very safe. There are plenty of people around at all times. - There are monkeys on some stretches - they are mostly harmless but do not carry any packets in hand when they are around. They try to snatch food packets.- The shrine board website is very useful while planning for the trip.- The battery operated cars are supposed to be for the use of elderly people only. However, I saw a number of younger folk too - possibly they were accompanying someone older."
953,Jai mata di!!!,"Irrespective of how much you believe in Mata Vaishno Devi, this pilgrimage is a must do for all Hindus. For us it was a wait until Bulaawa from Maa came. We planned to visit earlier but Mata Vaishnodevi decided that it was not the apt time- so we had to wait until now to do the trip.Travelled to Katra by train- or you could travel to Jammu Tawi and take the road to Katra. Booking your yatra parchi online will save you the time to do the registration in Katra. You need to state what ID document you would be carrying in your online booking- but nobody asked for it either at Banganga or at the Check point near the temple. Autos in Katra generally decide what they feel like charging you - and you don't have too much choice but go along and be taken for a ride.  Be ready to spend 100rs for a trip to Banganga where you start your yatra and 200rs to reach back Katra for your return trip (because they operate as shared autos). 50 rs seems to be   the minimum for an auto ride.In Banganga there are lots of hawkers trying to hard sell you all sort of stuff- but you get most of it anyway higher up and close to temple. The route is covered mostly and you are protected from weather- so really the consideration is required only for heavy rains. We did the walk early morning but there are lots of people who did it in the night. It is about 13kms trek - on the way up it is better to take the battery car route from Adhkuwari. The trek is not too hard and should pose no problem for the average healthy person particularly if your belief in Maa Vaishno Devi is strong. Don't carry too much luggage -leave the non essentials at Katra. Water, tea, coffee, snacks etc are available along your route and there are sit in restaurants run by board and even a Cafe Coffee day on the way. We had booked the morning aarti and stayed overnight in Bhawan- Vaishnavi Bhawan. If you book online make sure you take with you the credit or debit card which you used for booking- they might turn you back if you do not.The trek to Bhairon Gati from Bhawan is tougher and requires a higher level of fitness. We took pony for our way down since we had to catch a train. It took us 4.5 hours walking all the way up at a leisurely pace  and 2 hours by non-stop pony ride to walk down. There are helicopter services but they are weather dependent and were not operating on the day we were making our way down due to heavy rains and wind."
954,Spiritual and magnificent place !,"A Holy Track. Multiple ways to help yourself.1. By Walk2. By Walk - Pittoo (a hired person will carry your bag's or kids/infants). They walk along you.3. Khacchar -  Ride on Khacchar (a kind of horse).4. Helicopter - Katra to Sanjhichat, Bhawan is 2.5 km from Sanjhichat. If you book to-fro Helicopter ride, you'll get VIP pass for Darshan. *Helicopter rides are subject to local weather, they operate only in clear weather. 5. Banganga to Ardhkuwari - by Walk/Khacchar - Senior Citizen/differently abled can take Battery Operated Autorickshaw to Bhawan."
955,Great experience with natural beauty and Goddess ,"The climb to the shrine is long and steep (14 km)but made manageable by the sheds and eateries along the way. For those who cannot walk, there is shuttle service at some sections. You can also hire a horse.The shrine itself is well protected. It's inside a cave with water flowing underneath. It's a special spiritual feeling getting there that cannot be explained but needs to be felt. Overall, it's a journey worth taking."
956,Divine Experience,This was my second visit to Mata after a gap of 13 years. The facilities have further improved since then.
957,Mersmirizing,"Visited around mid of August, hoping it would be less of crowd but it was a weekend. Perhaps should do on weekdays."
958,Jai mata di,"This is an amazing pilgrimage and a must visit for all believers at least once in their lifetime. The climb is long and tough but well worth it.Although the shrine board has done a good job, at the bhawan things could be better. For example the places where pilgrims have to walk barefoot should be carpeted. Instead there are stones and rough surfaces. Some staff is rude. Should improve.But most blessed to have come."
959,just a business of the shrine board,This is a temple dedicated to Mata Vaishno Devi. Mata Vaishno Devi is an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi who also has powers given by Goddess Saraswati and Goddess Kali. The Vaishno Devi Shrine has Garv Gufa and Mata's Bhawan. Garv Gufa comes after a trek of 6.5 kilometres and Mata's Bhawan after around 12 Kilometres trek. The management of the shrine is fantastic. Do remember to collect Yatra parchi in Katta town and retain it until to complete all darshan. A number slip also needs to be collected for Garv Gufa darshan.
960,JAI Mata di ,"Once you reach Katra, you need to plan your further trip, there are multiple options nowaday, either you walk, go on a horse, palki and the helicopter.... It is a tough walk though there are multiple shops to keep you busy eating, quench your thirst. It will take atleast 6-7 hours for a new climber annd pretty tough one though, many people prefer to walk with the chants of ""Jai mata di"""
961,Just so peaceful ,"The place charges you with an altogether different positive energy. It has a chilly weather so you must carry enough clothes to keep you warm, they don't allow leather products inside so make sure you are not wearing leather jackets of belts. The place is now accessible via helicopter's but the joy still lies in walking."
962,Spiritual and peaceful visit,"I have been there multiple times, and every time we get the same feeling of being so close to the god and feel so relaxed and full of energy and positive vibes"
963,Bolo Shera Wali Mata Ki Jai.....,"Visited two times both are during winter season, so it is very helpful to walk through the stairs/slopes. The Temple or Bhawan is 13.5 km from Katra and various modes of transportation are available from katra to Bhawan, including Ponies, Electric vehicles and paalkhis operated by 2 or 4 persons. Helicopter services are also available up to Sanjichhat, which is 9.5 km from Katra. Bhairon temple is another 1.5 km from Bhawan."
964,JAI MATA DI,"The magic in this entire land is unbelievable - one can sense the strong energy & power all around. It is okay to even go alone as at any time of the day there are people either going up or down chanting ""Jai Mata Di"". For a religious person, it is a must go pilgrimage."
965,Overnight visit to VaishnoDevi,When you reach katra you have many options to stay just look around and book rooms wherever you want to .not so costly  easy on your pockets . If you time then can shop in the market in katra. this religious place is worth going and once you there then am sure you can't resist to plan every year .best is to go in winter season and if you not comfortable with winter then go in summers but trust my words you will feel and blessed there such beautiful religious temple .dont hire pithhu better to walk long way until you reach Mata Vaishnodevi mandir and. Bhairo baba . And many more . Food is simple and amazing . When you walking long way you will enjoy many things like shops food stalls. And people there you get to know many people coming there all so good nature down to earth .but please make sure take care of your belongings .if you reach at the top then you might be lucky to sit inside Darbaar for morning aarti also .its more worth than gold you have .the feeling is just out of the world .lac percent suggested temple .
966,Always feel blessed to be here !!,"We had booked helicopter ride in advance thru the temple's online booking facility. Whatever time you choose to take the helicopter be at the helipad office atleast an hour before. ONE MUST CARRY THEIR PHOTO ID AND THE CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD THROUGH WHICH THE BOOKINGS HAVE BEEN MADE ONLINE (not sure though what they do if you dont have ids and cards).After completing certain formalities they take you in their own vehicle to the helipad.Everything is very systematic and well controlled.You are given 2 hours 30 minutes to come back after darshan and take the return journey back.Please preserve the tickets (sort of boarding pass) till the end of the return journey.After landing you get the priority darshan pass and cloak room pass to keep shoes, bags , leather items etc..It is advisable for children and senior citizens to go by horse, pithu or palki specially if you are a first timer. Only people who are good in health should opt to walk the distance of roughly 2kms."
967,superb temple,"1.). 12Kms each way walk. 2). Helicopter  ride is available, provided you book well in advance.helicopter Ride Fare Rs. 2350/- 3). Battery operated vehicles available half way up.(5.6 Kms) 4). Pony Rides available. 5). Porters ( Pitthu's) are available for Rs. 400/- each way...to carry bags. Best time to Visit Vaishno Devi Temple End of Feb. Managed to enjoy the temple for almost a minute....vs the peak seasons. Very well maintained Bathrooms are available all through out....and very clean for it to be public toilets. Full marks to management."
968,Jai mata di,"We took the newly opened route this time.  Looks like this is slightly longer.  I think the distance is close to 13.3 kms from base to Bhavan.  Though it is my approximation. Looks like there is some problem in milestones and how they are inscribed. We started around 9 am and reached at 1:10 pm.  We stopped for 2 - 3 mins around 5 times.On return (the same day), we started at 9:45 pm and reached the base at 1:10 am.  This time included a quick dinner for 20 mins.  We stopped for 2 mins for 4-5 times.  My biggest worry was auto availability at that time of night.  Thankfully there were 3-4 of them and we took one to our hotel. Though the auto guy charged a bit higher.The new route is very clean, with very few eating/drinks kiosks.  There are many battery operated Mahindra mini tempos which are bigger than what was present in the older route.  They are driven recklessly and the bhakts on foot need to be alert.  There are no ponies on this route."
969,Manhandled by the security,Speechless! The aura is so devine. Never felt so close to positivity!It‚Äôs my request to all the devotees not to litter the place. The announcements are made in all languages that people understand. Surprised to see dustbins empty and roads littered when it should‚Äôve been the opposite.Hopefully this message awakens the self awareness!
970,Jai Mata Di...,"Dirty, no spirituality. Crass comercialisation, overpriced shops, ponies operated by Non Hindus are nuisance and just don't bother about religious feelings of devotees. Cartel by pony owners over charge blatantly. Shrine Board is non existent."
971,Vaishno devi trip,No word can summarise the experience u get here.Mata ki Showers her blessing on everyone here.Must visit once in lifetime!Divine experience !!
972,"Divine, faith and spiritual power is all you feel.","One of the Most Divine, Holy and Beautiful experiences of life. One of a kind, that you don't find everywhere. There has been many changes, of course good, with time. The journey starts from 'BanGanga'. You with need Yatra card/parchi to start the hike/climb. There are many ways to do Yatra, by walking, hiring on a pony/horse, or hiring a Palki/palanquin. They have mostly divided the way for people walking and going via horse, which was really good and helpful. The climb is steep till Ardhkawari. Just 1 km before people can go via Himkoti way, which is less steep, more broad, no horse are allowed and battery operated tempo go through that route. The Arthkarari, Hathimatha way is more steep. Along the way, you will find many resting places. There are more shops than before along the route. Its a long walk depending on your capacity, so we kept ourself hydrated through out the journey. You can get lockers easily before you go for Darshan. Darshan are divine. No words can be used to explain. You don't get to spent much time in the cave itself for 'PINDI DARSHAN' as there is a long queue. We spent time on the temple premises itself just absorbing the divine and holy experience. There are quite a few places to eat near the Bhawan. My fav one was Sagar Ratna, though I found it somewhat overpriced. We stayed at 'Parvati Bhawan', the dorm was clean, with clean washrooms and hot water supply. The view from balcony was magnificent. The 'Bairav Baba Temple' is situated at a different hill, which is more steep. We went there the next day. People also come via helicopter, there is helipad at 'Sanjhichat'. I think you have to book in advance for that."
973,"In Mata‚Äôs Darbar, concentrate on Pindi‚Äôs Only, Jai Mata Di","Visited in the first week of December. the weather was pleasant, not too cold, making it a comfortable journey. The crowd was less, making it easier to attend both the temples and Darshan was swift. If you take horses, ensure the saddle is good, else you will have pains and bruises for the next two days!"
974,Excellent!,"Vaishno Devi (VD); December 21 to December 22, 2016Reaching Katra- 1. Took a flight from Delhi to Jammu. 2. At the airport, took the token for Darshan (free of cost) and return taxi (‚Çπ2,250).3. The taxi is available outside the airport near the petrol pump.4. The distance is approx 45 km and takes about 1 hour 15 mins to reach Katra.5. Toll ‚Çπ50 and ‚Çπ15 for municipal tax is extra.6. Check-in at Swing Heights ‚Çπ3,000. Includes nice breakfast, drop and pick-up till the entry point and wifi. This is a nice hotel with running hot water and OK room. 7. I brought food (paranthas and gobi) from Delhi and ate a little at the hotel after shower and before leaving for the walk. I also ate some dates that I had brought from Delhi.From Katra to the Vaishno Devi Bhawan- 1. Left the hotel at 6 pm in the hotel cab.2. Started walk around 6.15 pm and reached Bhawan at 8.30 pm. Total distance from Katra to VD Bhawan is 12.5 km. I am in good health so was able to walk pretty fast. Usually it takes 3 and a half/ 4 hours.3. The walk till half-way Ardhkumari is steep; however after that it is better.4. I went straight to ""cloak room #2"". I already had showered in Katra so did not bother with finding a lodge at VD Bhawan. There was a que at the cloak room as the Aarti (6 pm to 6.30 pm) makes the availability of ""lock and key"" scarce. Anyways, it wasn't very bad and took me around 45 mts to keep my shoes and backpack in the locker. This is a necessary nuisance as you can only carry parshad and cash to the VD Bhawan. So, shoes, etc have to be stored. The cloak room is free to charge. Earlier it was ‚Çπ50 security deposit but now not even that.5. Went straight to VD Bhawan and it took me approx another 45 mts for the Darshan. The Darshan was not very rushed so a good experience. Actually just near last leg of the Darshan que there is a line on the left; I think that is better as most people continue on the line on the right and the one on the left is a little more relaxed. The pandit was also nice as he explained what are the 3 idols. The centre one is VAISHNO DEVI. 6. Finished the Darshan, took shoes, etc from the cloak room and was ready to leave by 10pm. Had a chocolate, however, did not eat anything at the VD Bhawan. Ideally, don't eat or bring something from home. The food quality is usually not very good and no point carrying it in your stomach for the walk. Anyways, never eat sambhar as it caused serious acidity last time when I ate at Sagar Ratna. 7. Return journey was fast and I was back at the starting point in Katra by 12.10 am. So it took me approx 2 hours to return. 8. Tried to find PCO to call for the cab but got an auto for ‚Çπ130 to drop me back. The phones from other states don't work so it is a pain to find PCO and call for the hotel car. I thought ‚Çπ130 is ok for a peaceful return. Bought water on the way. The medical shops were closed but Moov or something would have been idea to apply after the walk. It makes the muscles relax faster. 9. Was in the hotel by 12.20 am. Took a hot shower, had some food that I had brought from Delhi and went to sleep by 1 am.Back to Delhi-1. The cab was there on time and I left the hotel at 10.15 am. I had already paid for return journey so did not have to pay anything extra to the taxi driver. The only expense was till ‚Çπ50. 2. The breakfast in the hotel was nice. However, please do not overeat; the hilly journey will make you sick.3. Reached the airport by 11.30 am. 4. Smooth check-in. However, please identify your check-in luggage after security check. This is unique for Jammu airport but has to be done.Have a nice trip and god bless for your Vaishno Devi Darshan."
975,Goddess Vaishnodevi tempe,"The Hotel was too good. Services were really nice and staff was too co-operative. Will recommend every one to stay at this place. Near to railway Station and rooms are very clean and hygienic. Mr. Sunny the manager was very polite and co-operative and helpful.. Really thankful to the staff who helped us. The room was too good really nice clean and hygienic. Facilities were all good. Food is tasty and delicious. The breakfast was good and full of variety of dishes. We also had dinner there twice the order was given on time and the food was yummy and delicious. Hotel is located near to the station and is easily communicable, they provide good timely pick up and drop facilities.Highly recommended to all to stay in this hotel.Lemon Tree"
976,Truly Divine,"Its a good trek to the top but it is totally worth it. Easily accessible by helicopter, horses and by foot"
977,A sacred accomplishment... yet misses alot!,Nice place to visitYou should surely be there You will love the ambienceYou will love the ambienceYou will want to revisit
978,Simply amazing.,"This isn't a place actually requires any review or rating but this review is all about how to go and manage your journey. If you have faitn then it is obvious to visit bur if you don't have I must say this place is beautiful and the spiritual power around will make you feel that it is up to something. If you are going to visit, you have to reach katra by train, bus or however you want to travel. Take hotel in katra, take rest for a while if in a hurry or full night if not in a hurry. Start you journey to the mandir on foot, horse or palki early in the morning. Keep this in mind that entry to the mandir for dharshan get closed from 6pm to 8pm for aarti. After dharshan stay there you can book trust's room or beds according to your budget. Next morning start your journey to Bhairon mandir early so you can reach katra till evening same day."
979,Jai Maata Di....,You can always look it up. there's not much to say that has not been said already. I went with my parents for vip helicopter darshan. You just have a 2-3 hour window to see Vaishno devi then Bhairo mandir and then head back for the return helicopter. It's quite clean with well organized lines to queues. There are a lot of eating places also but had to skip those as we wanted to visit Bhairo mandir too.For people who can't walk long distances and are short of time- do take a pony.
980,Great trip,"Truly a surreal and blessful experience. The new measures takes by the Shrine Board are worth applauding. The place seems to be more neat and clean than ever before. Needs of the pilgrims are also looked after very well. One should really try ""Rajma Chawal"" at Vaishnodevi Shrine Board Canteen, they're truly delicious."
981,Jai ma Vaisho!!!!!!,"We started climbing the hill in the morning. The good thing was that the rush was low in the morning compared to what we saw in the evening. The weather was pleasant in the day time and we were in the clouds for some time while climbing. The new route to the temple which is far easier than the steep climbing via bhairo,  from ArdhKumari was opened at 11 AM approximately and we waited for it to open."
982,The road to the Goddess stretches on forever!,"Review can't summarise the experience n thrill u get here,its awesome n there is a positive vibe in the atmosphere, i have visited here thrice since childhood n its always been special!!"
983,Hike Plus seeing the GOD,"I will keep this review short if you need any information on visiting the shrine the best place is to check the official website. Here you will get all legitimate information. You also have the advantage to get the ""parchi"" online free of cost which can be availed 60 days prior to your visit. I would highly recommend paying the pitthu, ghoda or palki the desired amount as listed by the shrine board. These people take a lot of efforts so any extra payment is also highly encouraged, please do not bargain heavily, also make sure they have valid ID cards to operate. Before you start your journey, please take their contact number and photo of ID card, you never know when you need them.Rest this is a divine place, so its all about prayers and hope and beliefs. Do visit at least once in your lifetime, it's worth walking along.Few Pointers and Tips:There is no dedicated manage lined for the darshan so make sure you stay in a group and always connected. Also, there are locker facilities available free of cost so carry only needed items and keep all other belongings at your stay room. Make sure you wear the most comfortable attire and shoes (doesn't matter what that comfortable is you are best to judge it)Jai Mata Di!"
984,Jai mata di,hard climbing effort but worth it. The journey returning down was much harder than the climb up.Best to climb early morning
985,Sacred and revered shrine,Maa vaishno ka jab bulava aata Hai tabhi Jana hota hai It is said to be able to get the chance to go to vaishno Devi darshan when you are called by maa It is always the privilege to go there
986,JAI MATA DI,Excellent place to visit with family.Take a break and visit with your family. Devine place. Take 2days for visit.
987,Lovely trip,"Going on a pilgrimage is always fascinating and rejuvenating, but with young children in tow, the experience becomes better if the amenities available is good.I would say, the shrine board usually does a good job but yesterday when we visited , there was a lot of mis-management and chaos. People were running helterskelter without too much information being provided to them about the right of way etc. Otherwise, it was a good existence nevertheless.."
988,Vaishnodevi auto rickshaw services,"A wonderful trek to test your devotion. Amenities along with the way are adequate, nothing very impressive. Be prepared for multitudes who throng the shrine for a glimpse of holy deity."
989,Beautiful Religious Place,Better visit in winters as there is too much rush in summers especially in the month of june. All you can find is long ques.
990,visit to darbar,Superb location.. Varied experience... Excellent natural beauty... Adventurous... 14 kms walk... Not good for those who have heart complaints to walk
991,Visit Only If You have full faith on Maa Vaishno,The original cave is not visible from any location.It can only be viewed if u go in front. The cave is neat and clean and completely marbled. You will get only seconds to have darsan...
992,must visit holy hindu shrine,Mata rani jisko bulati hai wahi mata k darbaar me ja paata hai. Everytime we go feel really peaceful & calm. You should book room at Bhawan through Vaishno Shrine Board or Book room with OYO in Katra otherwise hotels charge whatever they want. ‡§ú‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ ‡§∂‡•á‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§¶‡§æ .....‡§¨‡•ã‡§≤‡•ã ‡§∏‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•á ‡§¶‡§∞‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§Ø ‡•§

994,It's not what you think.,It was a mesmerizing experience.the committee has been very prompt in keeping the area clean and user friendly.
995,Memorable visit,"This time, out of many many times in the past, it was very difficult to get the locker near Gate 3. One has to climb down steep stairs to access the lockers and then climb up these steep stairs. After this round one also has to climb steep uphill to reach the pony stand. Add them all it becomes very tiring, especially for the old and the very young. Locker facilities and location can be and must be improved."
996,"Great Holy Place in North India ""Mata Vaishno Devi Mandir""",A memorable pilgrimage. More details can be added to the web site of the temple to assist travelers coming from distant locations. Transparency of the temple board is falling short for online reservations.
997,"Jor se bolo jai mata di, saare bolo jai mata di","One of the most non informative pilgrimage. There are no full information available (except for (i) full published list price of ponies, palkhiwalas, and pithus, which none of them follow and charge much higher than list price; (ii) and distance in terms of kilometers). For the Darshan there are multiple gates and the entry for Darshan, is given as per the category decided by them, to you. If you have a two way helicopter ticket, you are given a priority access (you pay 2000 per ticket and get priority access), whereas, if you are travelling on foot (free of cost), you get least priority and will have to wait for hours and hours for a a glimpsic Darshan. Moreover the palkhiwalas charge exorbitant and most of them will only look to cheat all pilgrimages.At the main Mandir, Darshan spot there are police officers standing, who would push you out, after jus a small glimpse. It's better to do Darshan on live paid channels on TV."
998,Its where God Lives ( well almost),"If you a weekend free, that's what it takes to go there and come back. Even if you haven't plan earlier, take a Volvo/Merc from Delhi. Overnight journey and you will reach Katra. Transportation is till this place only. If you plan in time, you can book train tickets as well. If it is crowded book a decent hotel in katra, take a nap and start your journey in mid evening. If it is not crowded, walk upto window no. 2 and book a room for Bhawan. (do not carry lot of stuff apart from a one change)Do not forget to book your yatra parchi(travel ticket), that's free of cost but window closes by 1PM.The Yatra: take an auto from Katra to Barganga. It will cost you 100/- INR. Once you reach barganga you are at the entry point to yatra. Show the Yatra Parchi and you are good go start your trek. First Bag scan.It feels different the moment you start your journey, all those small shops and custom made temples will welcome you. Trek is between Easy to moderate, if you walk all the way nearly 14 km. (there are options for horses/Palki as well and not to be misses the helicopter ride but only if you book atleast two months in advance)Mid of journey it's adhkuwari, you can stop there do the darshan in the temple and start again. it's nearly 6 km walk from there.Once you reach the top, find a locker in case you haven't done room booking here. Store all the leather+Electronic+Metal etc. in the locker(mind you it's not easy to get locker, it may take hours).Then you stand in queue and if you do not have any priority passes it will take almost 2-3 hours for darshan. Line does stops at the time of Aarti(two times a day). It's overwhelming to see the enthusiasm while standing the queue and it feels great once you do your darshan. Remember the secret on the trek is, keep chanting ""Jai Mata Di"""
