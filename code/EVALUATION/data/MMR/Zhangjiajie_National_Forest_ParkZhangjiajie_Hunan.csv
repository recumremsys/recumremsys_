0,Beauty!!!,"No words can define the experience, it’s a must see attraction in Hunan. All I can say is, DO NOT SKIP THIS!!!"
1,Don’t Miss It,Literally no words can describe the beauty of this national park. I’m very thankful that was able to travel there and see the magic with my own eyes.
2,"Pillars, Crystal Clear Water and hikes any level can enjoy","Amazing landscape, beautiful mountains, beautiful views I join a group and for me it’s not clear how it works for an individual tourist. Everything is designed for tourist groups and if you go as an individual tourist there you might be face some communication problems. However, the mountains are worst to go there there, beautiful and excellent landscape, quite clean and everything is very well organised. I definitely come back again for another visit at another time. You better not go there during the summer holidays, I believe it’s crowded everywhere."
3,Superb national park with lots of hiking opportunities,"Zhangjiajie is just too good to be true!It's beyond my expectation. The mountains are like pillars that rise upon the clouds, which is just too magnificent to see. I felt like I was walking in the heaven. Together with Halong Bay, Zhangjiajie is the most beautiful landscape that I've ever seen."
4,Fantastic views ,"There is a reason people travel from around the world to come here: the epic landscape and it is no stretch to see how it could inspire the landscape in the movie Avatar.  The problem is that your visual experience is very dependent on the fickle weather in this part of China.  On our day, there was a lot of moisture in the air, high clouds and little sun.  As photography is very important to me when I travel, the experience was muted.  Very muted.Additional consideration: best to go when the Chinese are not on holiday as the crowds and lines become mind-boggling.  I'm glad I came here but left disappointed."
5,Amazing!!!,"I love mountains, and this place is one of the most wonderful I have ever visited, inspiring and pleasant at the very same time. Despite being crowded as most of Chinese tourist attractions, the park is so big you can easily get lost without meeting anybody for hours. It is true, not all trails lead somewhere, but once in a while even getting lost has its fascination. Only real drawback, we were ""promised"" lots of monkeys but we just could see a pair from very far away."
6,Amazing place and views its a must,"This place was so unusual and meditative, it took around three months ruminating on and about my feelings. I tried to grasp the ambiance mentally, to perceive the greatness of this place. And I would never be my previous self.You'll see as many pillar shaped rocks on uwur journen through this forest park, as you've never seen before. Don't rush, embrace it, think about its greatness."
7,Stunning!,Scenery was great and very clean. Convenient enough to get to. My only irritation Big irritation is that like so many tourist places in China you need to keep your wallet out. They can never seem to sell a one payment ticket. After you pay to get in you still need to pay for this and that and some other thing. AnnoyingYou need a few days to see everything and hope the weather cooperates
8,Amazing views,"This is one of the the most beautiful places I have ever visited. Is looks like a fairytale and unlike Huangshan they really organized everything pretty well. We traveled with our two boys - 6 and 7 years old - and they had a great time walking, looking at the mountains and the monkeys. Oh and enjoying the Mcdonalds on top of one of the mountains 🙃"
9,Worth a journey,"Absolutely beautiful and worth the trip. In the 4 years we have been in China, nothing compares domestically (so far). Just hope for a clear day."
10,gorgeous,This is like no where else I have visited in the world. The park is based on a US national park model so is very accessible and is well maintained but the many staff who work there. A huge range of sights and walks to enjoy - you should give a number of days to explore this fantastic place!
11,Epic!!!,"We spent 3 days in Zhangjiajie with out tour guide Mr Ash, who we got through Grace Yang (zjjexpert@foxmail.com) as she had another group she was working with. We were staying at a neaby hotel 5 minutes walk to the national forest park entry. The first day was the national forest park and it is simply a sight to behold, and the pathways are well mapped out and maintained. The signage is also on point. There are many wonders of nature. We enjoyed trekking and riding the cable car to the top of the mountain. We also saw the inspiration to the movie avatar 'son of heaven' mountains that shoot up for the the deep valley with layers of rock packed onto each other so precisely. There is also a beautiful mountain lake within the park. Being the only black people among the sea of Chinese and very countable Caucasians, the Chinese, both young and old were quite mesmerized by our skin color, they were secretly taking photos, recording us and some went even ahead to touch our skin to feel it. We weren't bothered though as we understood it is a very remote tourist city and many chinese may never have ventured out further into other major cities. We came down with the world's fastest elevator, it is in the Guinness world book of records.The second day we went to the Yellow dragon cave which is one of its kind and very deep and Boafeng lake which is so beautiful atop the mountain. We also did the Grand Canyon glass bridge. My wife's legs were all of a sudden jelly and she couldn't look down the canyon through the glass. It is an experience of its kind, the heights are dizzying but all the same awesome work of engineering. We also had a chance to sample chinese local delicacies. We got into a tea house and got to learn the art of tea drinking.The 3rd day we went to the Tianmen mountains and rode the worlds longest and highest cable car. 7.5 Km long, on top of the mountain we also did the cliff walk on terrible heights, it was rainy and foggy, my wife was overjoyed that the fog was hiding the scary heights on the cliff side walk and hence not afraid. Coming down we used the chairlift and also the elevators that are dug in the middle of the mountains (give it to the chinese) We also walked down the 999 steps from the gateway to heaven and later took the bus down the winding roads down the mountains to the station in town.Overall, it was a great time and our guide Ash"
12,Take advantage of the elevator & cable car etc. as lots of walking,"This is a must visit place, when in china, a unique wonder of this world and nature creation, its simply picturesque."
13,Better than James Cameron's terrible film.,"I was guided to this place by a friend who is working in China. This is an area that must be in the top ten areas of outstanding natural beauty anywhere in the world. It provided the inspiration for the hallelujah mountains in the film ‘Avatar’. The area is dominated by the limestone pillars topped by trees. However no photograph can do justice to the epic scale of these structures, they truly need to be seen to be believed. Give yourself some time and try to visited a range of locations. This is a place that will stick with you forever."
14,a beautiful park to spend a couple of days,"Tian Zi mountain is the best for me ;)Avatar mountain is too packed for a good viewing experience.The park is relatively easy to walk, not too arduous. At Yang Jia Jie, there is a part where there are metal railings for you to climb to 'Tianbo Mansion', I think that was a fantastic experience.If your guide asks you to go to view the Tribal Village, be wary that you are asked to buy local produce or pay an expensive fee to go in... ask before you go if you mind the time and fee. Cos of the time spent there, I didnt manage to go Baofeng Lake, kind of sad. The Ten Mile Gallery walk is not too long, just takes about 20-30mins and is an easy walk."
15,Breath taking views ,"The experience I got from this place is beyond my expectation. This forest park is just awesome. I took many pictures so I can capture how beautiful this place is. But camera just can't do the justice. You have to see it on your own. Prepare for lots of walking, hiking, and trekking. But it's all worth it..."
16,Nature,"The park is absolutelly magical. And also really big. I was travelling alone with no guide, what made things a bit more complicated. The fees are high for the prices around China, if you don´t have much time and need to use the cable car and the elevator you have almost 70 dollars just for the tickets of this park, although the tickets are valid for 3 days.There is absolutelly no information in english, tourists are almost all chinese, to try to walk around alone you gonna need a really good map, what is also rare. The government buses inside the park are included in the ticket and are a good help but half of the routes do not run when is snowing so if going in the winter pepare youself to walk a lot!Anyway is really worthed, is the kind of unique place that you need to see at least once in your life."
17,Don’t miss if you yet to visit!,"This place is by far one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. The price of 247 yuan is steep but it’s valid for 3 days which is good. We didn’t bother getting any cable cars, we just hiked from the bottom up to the top of where the avatar mountains are. The scenery along the hike is amazing not only because of the views but because you basically have it to yourself with not many people around. Once you get to the actual avatar mountain area, it’s so full of Chinese tourists, it starts to turn into a nightmare. Walking shoulder to shoulder with spitting Chinese who have no care in the world that you are also trying to take pictures. Absolute nightmare. But you have to endure it if you want to see this part of the national park. Taking the bus takes an agonising 1h30mins or so. It’s tiring/annoying if you are trying to get a full day at the park."
18,Private tour guide in Zhangjiajie,"This was an amazing experience and place to visit in China. I had arrangements before arrival with the great tour guide Frank Chen < frankusa123@outlook.com > and his driver. They made our experience smooth and easy with a lot of information about the park and the other places we visited. It had snowed a few days before our arrival, but we weren’t affected a lot by that ( we got lucky). Being in this national forest feels like you are in a nice different looking fary land full of wonders."
19,STUDENT SCAM BEWARE,"I am one of those people who lover the Avatar movie and always wished to visit this place. Last year, I had the opportunity and it was definitely worth it. Zhangjiajie is truly magical. My hostel was located up in the mountain and it provided a perfect spot to travel around and visit all corners of this huge national park. I mostly walked to all my destinations and climbed everything on my own, combining the fantastic view with sense of accomplishment once you reach the top is awesome. If your health and schedule allows you to do so, I recommend you to get lost in this place and appreciate nature. 10 out of 10 experience, I just wish that getting there was a bit more convenient. Firstly, I landed in Changsha, then took a bus to Zhangjiajie(the city). And from there, another bus up to the mountain. I saw some workers building a new road, so hopefully for future travellers, getting there will be less of a challenge."
20,Do not miss this park. Views are unbelievable.,"Truly amazing experience.  As westerners we were in a real minority. I think we saw about 20 others in four days. But the Chinese welcome and helpfulness made this experience even better. There is only one tip I would give: hire a guide. We hired Chris Tan (tanjunxi@126.com).  A wonderfully informative chap who knew just where to go and most importantly, when.  He drove us around and we managed to avoid virtually all the queues. We saw the lot too! He was attentive to our food requirements too. We like Chinese food but he wanted to be sure that we didn’t get things we might not expect ...all that in an authentic restaurant. His service extended to picking us up at the airport, dropping our daughter back there and giving us lifts after his guide services had ended. He made our trip very special.  Add to that one of the best sightseeing experiences we have had (and we travel a lot!) and this is an unbeatable package at an affordable price...believe me ...it’s worth it!"
21,Unforgetable Zhangjiajie,Zhangjiajie National park is a must for all those visiting China. We hired a guide for five days that took us all over the park. With incredible scenery seen from a cable car and chairlift high amongst the clouds. Breathtaking stuff. We walked along the canyon floor along side the  Gold whip stream...just gorgeous. We went with Tour China Guide. Zania was our guide she was informative . Her English was reasonable. And most of the time she understood what we asked or said. Do yourself a favor and dont miss out on this park. Tour China Guide is the best!
22,Zhangjiajie AVATAR,"amazing nature, forget that you have deep fright. our trip was completely planned from Beijing to Hong Kong so we had a guide"
23,Zhangjiajie Park,"It felt like the movie Avatar, watching the scenery walking down from Tianzi Mountain. I think this is a place where you’ll want to find a trail to yourself, to get lost in another world.To do that, you’ll have go in the opposite direction and at different times than the Chinese tour groups. I was able to do this by taking a bus to the Bailong elevator, walking along the Golden Whip Stream (1 hr), then taking the stairs up to Yuan Jia Jie / Hallelujah Mountain at the Getting Together From Farway juncture (1.5 hrs). The stairs will be behind you, so it can be easy to miss. I passed only one group going up and when I got to the top, I had the place by myself until I reached the first few platforms closest to the cable car station. It was really incredible and the hike up, with monkeys all over the bottom half of the trail, was great. After that, I took the bus to Tianzi Mountain (1 hr) and hiked down via Ten-Mile Natural Gallery. (It’s not Ten-Miles, more like One-and-a-Half-Miles.) First, I had a late lunch at McDonald’s and I was never happier to see one. The hike down took me two hours, though there might be a shorter route via Heavenly Southern Gate. Since it took that long, I’d imagine the hike up Tianzi Mountain would be harder than Hallelujah Mountain. I would do it though, if I came during high season and there are lots of people. I can guarantee no Chinese tour guide is going to lead his group up the most difficult route.The hotel staff thought I wouldn’t be able to hike up or down, given my late start. I did both and had maybe half an hour to spare. I got to the Bailong elevator at 10:15am and came back down to Wulingyuan by 5pm, just as the sun set. So, it was fine. I’m feeling happy that I didn’t take an elevator in what’s supposed to be a national park.Though the scenery was really spectacular, I was pretty disturbed throughout the day having seen a monkey with its paw caught in a trap at the Bailong elevator. I tried to get close to it to remove the trap, and got pretty close, but then a security guard came and shooed it away. It was so sad and heartbreaking. The trap had stripped the flesh at the wrist and I could see through its armbones, with its tiny paw caught inside the trap. I don’t know what people are doing laying traps in the park and how the grounds people can let the monkey suffer like that. Like, you can tell they just did not care. It was awful."
24,You will probably get lost,"This is my second trip to Zhangjiajie and it is still as interesting as ever. The big disappointment is the Glass-floor Bridge which  I wanted to see this time.It was a big disappointment.  Cameras, big or small are not allowed on the bridge. We were limited to using our mobile phone cameras.  It was after a short shower and the glass were wet with small pool of water.  The glass is too reflective and we ended up taking our shadow instead of the scenes below the glass. Our cameras may be able to overcome this but without it, it was useless unless you rest the lens on the glass itself."
25,Wondrous -- too much to take in,"This park is extremely beautiful. A lot to see in the Avatar park, how is known, and totally worh it for the price. You just need to avoid the cable cars, elevators, etc. to not find the Chinese massive tours everywhere. If you walk a bit, you will find yourself alone among all that beauty"
26,A must see,"We stayed in Zhangjiajie city and paid 12RMBpp for a bus to the park entrance (takes roughly and hour - ticket purchased on the bus and if you show a staff member the park map they will put you on the right bus). The ticket to enter the park costs 248RMBpp (valid for entry for 3days) and purchase only at the gate, not the scalpers hanging around outside!With your ticket you're given a map and you can determine your walking route. If you only have one day we suggest avoiding the glass bridge and elevator (you'll avoid a lot of crowds this way - and save some money on something thats actually quite overrated). Visit the Avatar mountain scenic area early - or it will seem just as busy as the metro stations at peak hour! This circuit is simply stunning and the reason we visited the region. We were lucky that we arrived early and seemed to have it all to ourselves, it was well worth the journey and 1hr climb up stairs to get there! (You can also take a shuttle if your concerned about fitness level)Some of the walks can be challenging, wear good shoes and plan carefully if you're not of adequate fitness level. Theres plenty of food options with local stalls, KFC and McDonalds on the mountain top!We would recommend at least 2days there to see everything thats worthwhile without rushing. It would be much closer and easier to stay in Wulingyuan, a funky little town right at the entrance gate to the park."
27,Beautiful nature but exploited ,5 seconds with 25 other people is not worth. we saw nothing as it was so foggy. BAD not worth it. cableway is better!
28,"Stunning scenery but overcrowded, expensive and disorganized","The National Park is huge.  We stayed in Yangjiajie which is more rural with fewer queues to get into the park.  The tickets are valid for 4 days and include the park buses to get around to various areas.  The elevator and cable cars are expensive but helpful if you want to get to other areas more quickly and with less walking.  Lots of people we met either didn't have a map or didn't have a very good map of the park so try to get a good one before entering the park.  You can get a guide to take you around the park but with a good map you shouldn't need one.  Public buses from the city to the park area are cheap.  Stay in a hotel closer to the park (rather than Zhangjiajie City) so you can make the most of your time - the park closes around sunset.We made use of the full 4 days in the park.  We were there during a week where it was cloudy and a bit rainy but we were still able to get some great views.  On a rainy day you should still get views along the Golden Whip Stream (even if it is cloudy up top).  Be prepared to climb lots of stairs, see lots of monkeys, and see some amazing scenery.  You can get some snacks along the way but you might want to bring food/drink with you for the day.  Make sure you avoid Golden Week in China (around 1-7 Oct).  We postponed our arrival and the park was much more peaceful and queues were shorter."
29,Beautiful,"Many people thought the landscape in the movie Avatar was animated computer generated; it was not, this is the landscape where it was filmed.  I was surprised to see monkeys here but since monkeys (macaques) are also found in Japan I wasn't that surprised, I did photograph a couple.  This park is huge but there is adequate bus transportation to move people about different view areas.  My guide and I also used a walking trail of about 2 or 3 Kms to avoid getting to some crowded areas.  It was not strenuous,  I am 71 years old, was actually a comfortable walk cloudy but not rainy with excellent views and places to sit and take a break along the way.  I would strongly recommend people visit Wulingyuan National Park, well worthwhile.  Having a local Chinese speaking tour guide is also a great help when visiting places like this in China.  Beware Chinese will often push and crowd to get ahead of people, stand your own ground, the local people understand this and it is a normal routine there as well as other countries in East Asia."
30,Zhangjiajie,"The park offers great views. But you feel like you are in a big Chinese themepark. A lot of crowds, Chinese screaming people and big groups.The price is high and you have to pay extra for transport. Tip: - dont think you can hike in nature, like. Maybe only when you go up- get yourself a good map and informations before you enter the park."
31,Made the right choice in mode of ascent up the mountain,ive seen so many mountains  and parks in my lifetime but this place is so awesome  natural wonders indeed;   Iam in an awe looking at this rugged mountains  and cant thank our Good Lord for giving me a chance to see his wonder creation and giving me the strenth and good health to walk the steps  and tolerate the high altitutude.
32,Breathtaking and meditative,"After reading several reviews I booked Bruce Tian for 3 days to guide my wife and I for our visit to Zhangjiajie. Bruce speaks fluent English and was very happy to tailor an itinerary to suit our needs. He has an excellent knowledge of the park's best vantage points and prearranged all the entrance and lift tickets. We spent one day exploring Yellow Stone ""village"" and Gold Whip stream, the second day in the Tianzi mountain and Yuanjiajie scenic area and the last day at Tianmen mountain. All areas offered outstanding natural beauty and Bruce's friendly and efficient service made the experience even more memorable. I would highly recommend him and it is easy to find his contact details through a Google search."
33,Zhangjiajie private tour with Bruce Tian,"Truly a beautiful place it’s a must see pictures don’t do it justice,it’s a very big park you need minimum 3days to see most of it."
34,Guided tour of national forest park,"Just beautiful!  The glass walkways are not that exciting, they have been scratched so much that you really can't see much below but it is still fun walking on the edge of a mountain!  It was very cloudy/foggy the day we visited so you could see none of the recommended places like ""First Bridge under the Sun"" and Fairy Maiden presenting Flowers"" and it was difficult to get photos of anything until we went down lower but absolutely recommend coming."
35,Natural Beauty at its Best,Everyone going to China should visit this area.  Scenery is out of this planet!!!  We stayed in the park for three full days with the private guide from Odynovo Tours.  I would strongly recommend taking the guide who is familiar with the area and can make navigation easy.
36,China's highlights!,"Amazing to walk on glass across a gorge with lots of folks. The glass ( newest) bridge is well worth the effort to arrive at Zhangjiajie national area! How one gets there is a topic for discussion, a reputable travel agency is advised and always keep your valuables on your person.( enough said) In my / our case the ride from Wuhan via high speed rail to Jingzhou was smooth and quite as per usual on the rail system. The bus ride via tourist agency from Jingzhou to the national park ...leaves a lot to be desired . I will express my disgust in the fact that the tour agency does try and pressure sell you on items at last stop prior to your hotel ... I absolutely despise that .....So you have been forewarned .The worlds longest and tallest glass bridge is worth every penny spent to arrive there .( minus the pressure sale).... Not just the bridge but the entire scenery , water fall.  Creeks , lake,cave( bandits)...boat ride and yes the picture session with "" the monkey king""... A person just has to keep their sense of humor and enjoy life !  The path of life and enjoyment is about 2.8 kilometers long !( 99%Down hill) praise Buddha! Also a few vertical step challenges... but not bad .The staging area for the bridge is organized , restrooms are always backed up with people .( could use more of them)  but walking to and on bridge is at your leisure ....Once you put on the rubber booties and dare yourself to walk on glass 2-3000 feet above the little tiny river way down there ! Should you still have that sense of humor I was talking about a minute ago .... jump up and down on the center glass!!!.....Godzilla has arrived!( maybe that's just me )!Anyway booking the trip via local agency was actually cheap $400 US ( for2 )I suppose they hope for sales... I will say that I was the only English/American  (245 pounds) ... maybe that's why Godzilla came ! Included in this deal was -train, bus, 2 nights,2 meals, park pass ...great adventure for the daring ! Or you can drive there yourself , which I will opt for the next trip .Technical things- fear of heights ( don't look down)🤣Seriously you must be 5 feet tall . No weight limit , water and food stops along the Travel path after bridge....Absolutely beautiful scenery mixed with modern technology!"
37,a must see place  and should be on everyones bucket list,"The park itself is huge and is as beautiful as in pictures. I actually found getting around the park much easier than the national parks in the USA, assuming you're willing to pay. Once you pay the entrance fee, you will need to pay to ride the various cable cars, elevators, etc. that get you around the park. Buses are free with admission, but they won't take you everywhere in the park.One thing that surprised me was that seemingly all of the paths in this park are paved, even the 'hiking paths' that go up the sides of the mountains. We took a couple several hour hikes which were much easier than expected due to this.Overall, a great park and a great experience."
38,3 Nights Zhangjiajie ,Nature is distinctly different and beautiful in the region of Zhangjiajie National Park. We absolutely loved the walks and the bailong elevator and huangshi village. On top of this we also visited Tianmen mountain one hour away.
39,Out of this world,"It's unfortunate that this is one of the most renowned attractions in China.For one thing, the landscape, while exotic and generally attractive, is far from surreal or or astounding. Just based on the scenery itself, this place maybe gets 3.5 stars.  This place isn't within the top 10 in Asia, or even in Mainland China. But then you have to take into consideration the exorbitant ticket price (around $35 USD, which doesn't even include the elevators or cable cars, both of which are also exorbitantly priced). If you want to visit the place independently, you also have to take into consideration the general lack of organization of the place -- the maps and signage are awful (and reading and speaking Chinese only helps marginally), and the shuttle bus routes are very confusing. And as in most famous places in China, the park is absolutely mobbed with Chinese tourists, who behave as you expect Chinese tourists to. While it is true that hiking is pleasant and allows you to leave 95% of the crowds behind, the hikes are generally in forested paths, so you don't get any opportunity to appreciate the views in peace. In short, China is full of spots which are much more scenic and much less stressful than Zhangjiajie. Assuming your time (or your budget) is limited, it's best to skip this one."
40,Beautiful national park,"I recently joined a group organized and accompanied by Graham Elsom through Jebson Holidays, to ZHANGJIAJIE National Park.  This would have to be one of the best short holidays I have ever experienced.  The location was amazing and the organization first rate.  Graham Elsom, I believe, has had decades experience in putting together this type of vacation.  He  knew his subject very well, and kept our group entertained with many stories and put everyone at ease.  His local Guide, Chris was incredibly helpful, calm amongst local hiccups, and the holiday went like clockwork.  The location,  ZHANGJIAJIE National Park, was spectacular, with soaring Mountains, quaint old villages and ‘Light Show’ entertainment.  What a trip…I would have no hesitation in recommending Graham Elsom and his crew at Jebson’s Holidays, when planning a different style holiday."
41,Amazing scenery,"Rain & cold & icy weather does not diminish the wonder of this place, the stunning rock formations, the forest cover, the cloud cover - small wonder that James Cameron got inspired by the sheer beauty of the sorrounds -"
42,Out of this world!,"This National Park is perhaps one of the most amazing things I have seen in China.  For nature lovers it is perfect. Spectacular scenery.  I especially loved the walk at the base of the mountains along the river. We stayed in Zhangiajie Town, but if I went again I would stay in Wulingyuan as it has easier access to the park."
43,Beautiful stunning unique definitely worth it,"The Zhangjiajie Park is amazing, so much to see.  They do a great job of moving people around using shuttle busses so you can see a lot of the park in a day.  It gets quite busy in some areas but they have extra walkways to try to keep things flowing.The cable car ride down from the mountain top is incredible, worth the ride to the top."
44,no words,A place that i enjoyed myself in China. Beautiful and stunning scenery. Went in december but so lucky that we caught the stunning view of this beauty. Definitely a worth experience. The mountains are very beautiful. December is an off peak seasons so it's not pack with tourist.
45,Avatar-esque,"Breathtaking national park which was the inspiration for the Avatar Floating mountains scenery. Very little english but it is possible to get around without a guide as there are many shuttles that are free once you pay the entrance fee (300Yuan for 4 days I think) that take you everywhere within the park. Yangjiejie is a must see, as is Hallelujah Mountains! Take the long cable car and Bailing lift as well!"
46,Breathtaking views,the place is so beautiful that leaves you speechless when you see the mountains from the top you see the fog resting like a blanket
47,Must see but crowded and at times a challenge,"We only have 2 days to spend in the famous Zhangjiajie Scenic area. Language barrier is one of our problem in China and luckily we find a local English speaking guide in short notice by the name of Grace Yang which definitely made it quicker & easier for us to experience everything our desire. Some say it easy to travel by your own and just follow the crowd, but it is much easier to have a local guide to ensure you had the best views, managed to get a seat on all transport and entrance tickets. Luckily we visit the park during the school opening in China, so the park is not cramped with local tourist. Literally its a walk in park to us according to our guide. We would like to recommend Grace Yang for everyone, she one of the best English speaking guide in Zhangjiajie."
48,Tall gigantic vertical rock structures where we can easily access from base to summit.,One of its kind forest park in the world. Zhangjiajie has a lot to offer. We spent a good 5 nights in Zhangjiajie and toured the main attractions and attractions off the beaten track. Well worth the time and effort to reach this paradise.
49,Amazing Scenery!!!,The park features some stunning vistas and unique geology so you can almost imagine the backdrop for Avatar . The mists add a mysterious quality to the experience
50,Zhangjiajie national park,Pictures and words don't really do this place justice.Gorgeous scenery with a different look wherever you go.Plenty of exercise as well.
51,Backpackers in ZJJ,The most beautiful mountains and scenery. Very peaceful and beautiful. We were lucky to go at the start of gold week when it was still quiet.
52,Beautiful area,"The mountain formations are something to witness! It is amazing to see the massive pillars towering over you or next to you when in the cable car. There are numerous scenic stops that you reach via buses. Navigating was quite a challenge since there were multiple different maps and the signs are not accurate with informing you of your location. Multiple people (even locals), were lost and even asking how to get off of the mountain. This is quite difficult and can become laborious, which kind of spoils the mood. When you are in the area, I highly recommend visiting Tianmen mountain which is not far from Zhangjiajie"
53,An amazing and unique park,Wonderful place to see. We are fron Canada and it was myself 60 yrs old and my daughter 23 yrs old on a trip to see China. Had a tour guide English speaking called Zinia. She was very informative and told alot of stories of the area and the region as well as the National park. We spent 2.5 days in the park and saw it from both sides of the canyon as well as walked along the Gold Whip stream. You can check with Zinia if you want information on tours or the area in general at 1127619454@qq.comThe scenery from Avatar came from this location and very different from anything else I've seen around the world.  Totally recommend this park on your trip to see the natural beauty of China.
54,Site seeing zjj,"We had a 3 day private tour through chinatravel. Bree our tour guide was great, adapted to the conditions and took us to quiet places. A must see when in China, spectacular scenery."
55,Fabulous park .. you need more than 2 days,a must see and experience  that will be one of the most important place visited on earth.  Its view is amazing!!!
56,Incredible view,"Oct 13It's a hassle but worth it.  First, the pushing and shoving as we queue to go on the shuttle buses.  It takes 1H of waiting time, but it's Sunday.  There seems to be an endless line of shuttle buses taking us deeper.  The drivers are like dare-devils and negotiate the curves (without shoulders) over mountain passes without pause.We stop for lunch at a KFC. Terrible -- I'm not sure it was chicken -- and expensive.  The public restrooms are the pits! -- smelly and wet floors.Take your trekking poles.  We walked almost 3 miles in one period.  Plus, there are plenty of steps, but the platforms for viewing are carefully chosen and brilliant.We reach our first of two glass bridges, which is supposed to be the highest and longest glass bridge in the world. It was an underwhelming experience.  It is not totally glass but glass panels in a steel grid.  So many visitors posing on the glass floors although the view below is obscured with fog.You'll have to see this 1992 UNESCO World Heritage site, which includes the Hallelujah Mountain, the inspiration for the movie ""Avatar."""
57,Must do in China Visit,This place is a must-see.  Breathtaking views from so many places.  Pictures just don't do it justice.  See for yourself the beauty of this place!  Take your time.  There are many place to explore and see.  The shuttle takes you between everything.  We had a guide.  That was helpful.
58,Amazing landscape ,"A must see place when in China! We were lucky enough to visit on a sunny day in May. Stunning scenery. Used the tourist bus to get around. Monkeys can be a problem so remember not to hold any food in your hand nor get food out your bag when the monkeys are about. Put food inside a rucksack, don’t hold a carrier bag with food in it or the monkeys will rush up and grab it. All common sense really! Recommend a visit here."
59,Beware of everything in the city (and monkeys),"I had had very high expectations for this park but was disappointed. The views are gorgeous - that's true - and unlike anything else I've seen. But there isn't much of the hiking - most of the time you will be moving from point A to point B by bus. And due to a poor organization, it's not always easy to find out where the bus is going. Also, the experience is spoilt by very loud crowds. I expected the crowds but the fact the group tours are using microphones and loudspeakers make them heard from a very long distance."
60,china trip 2019,"I recently spent three days exploring Zhangjiajie national park and it's safe to say that it holds some of the most beautiful views I've ever seen. You honestly feel like you are on Pandora as you walk around exploring the place where avatar was filmed. It's very well organized, with English sign posts and free shuttle bus services taking you to different sections of the park. I definitely recommend getting a map with both Chinese and English titles, and working out a route before you go. This makes it easy to ask for directions as you can just point to the Chinese translation of where you want to go. The southern section of the park is also home to a bunch of lively Baboons, honestly we found them quite frightening as they occasionally grabbed tourists backpacks. However if you avoid them I think they usually avoid you! Finally, I highly recommend staying at MINI Inn, as it makes a great base for exploring the national park. It's located just outside one of the entrances, is beautiful and affordable, and they have the best traditional home cooked meals! They also help you plan a route for exploring the park which was incredibly useful."
61,Watch out for the monkeys!,"I had high expectations from all the videos I had seen and reviews I had read. The park was not disappointing at all, it even exceeded my expectations.After a week in Shanghai and Hangzhou and then a 18 hour train ride, it was nice to be out in nature. The difference in air quality is very noticeable.I started out with the cable car to Huangshi village. There I completed a full circuit of the plateau, which took me 3 hours or so. The sceneries here are quite something. At several places there are platforms where you can hear echoes if you yell loudly, which of course many people did.After this circuit, I went back down to the main road. Here I followed the Golden Whip Stream. This was quite something. It was very peaceful to stroll past the stream. There are monkeys in this area and they are out in the open. One of them got pretty close to me, but generally they don't come too close to people. They are the cute, small kind, so it was fun to look at.Instead of taking the Bailong elevator, I took a left towards a set of stairs. Initially, it didn't look like there were many steps and I was expecting about 30 minutes of climbing. Boy was I in for a treat. 2 hours later I managed to reach the top. Mind you, I was pretty out of shape and stopped many, many times along the way. Some nice fellow travellers encouraged me on the way and even offered me water and snacks. Nice people!Once at the top, I was rewarded with more breathtaking views of the karst mountains spread across the park.At the top there are also a few hotels down the road. I had heard that the government had closed down all hotels inside the park, but it turns out that there are still a few up and running.I would recommend staying at least 2 nights here, since it is quite a large park and you can hike for 2 whole days for sure."
62,Wendy Wu tour of Zhangjiajie,"No photo, video or recording could do justice or convey the grandiose and natural beauty of Wulingyuan 武陵源. You need to be present to see, hear, smell and feel this place.The area is huge, and covers both the Tianmen Mountain 天门山 National Park and the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park 森林公园. Each pass entitles you to multiple visits of 3 days.As the scenery is so awesome and out of this world, parts of it were used to film the Avatar Movie as well as Chinese serials of Journey to the West 西游记。We started off at the East Entrance 东门 and ascended to the peak of Tianzi Mountain 天子山. Subsequently, we took some shuttle bus rides to various locations and walked till we reached The Enchanted Terrace, where you get the best views of the Avatar mountains.From there, we hiked 10km all the way down to capture as many scenic sights as possible, while savoring the fresh air and fragrance of the trees.The fatigue and exhaustion was most worthwhile as in exchange, we earned memories to last a lifetime."
63,"1 day tour of Zhangjaejie National Park, Grand Canyon's glass bridge, and Baofeng Lake",I was determined to get to Zhangijajie National Park( where the Avatar stunning scenery was based upon); I had read reviews that you needed a guide- this was correct. I had also read about Bruce Tian; he was absolutely amazing. He really looked after me and made the whole trip so memorable.I was with him for four nights and days and felt totally comfortable with him.Thanks Bruce; you are a star; Abby
64,Avatar all the Way!,If you go at the right time. I joined a tour and we started calling our tour “into the mist” as that was all we were seeing. Check the weather as we went when it rained and we saw nothing but white mist.
65,Come and see for yourself,"The landscape here is really fantastic, I fully understand Avatar used this location for the movie. You can do many hiking tours in various areas of the park. Some areas (the most famous ones)are very crowded with tons of tourists which is the only downside. But you can find still many spots where there are not so many tourists and there you can really fully enjoy the surroundings. For me a must visit in China, be prepared for many tourists but get a guide who will bring you to quiet places and you will love it!"
66,Absolutely gorgeous!,"spectacular, unusual, wow, grandeur, majestic, pick a word can't describe how these land cliff vegetation formation occurs, only in nature's oven I guess.   I wasn't blessed with good weather, which made it expensive and got to see very little, but the little I saw was impressive.  I'd have to go back for another visit maybe a week's stay to see in it's entirety."
67,Amazing,"I’m really need a tour guide to visit in China, zhangjiajie national forest park always crowded,I’m surprised when I saw Macdonald there,mind your steps with slippery stairs."
68,A very beautiful place but please check before you come to this place.,"ZJJ National Park is an amazing place to visit. Although the we visited during the winter month of January, we throughly enjoyed the many attractions in and around the park area.During the high season, I can only imagine how crowded the park can be.  During our visit, there were no long waiting lines of people, so we were able to make the most of our 2 days there. It is truly a sight to see And enjoy.."
69,Stunning place,What can I say - personally this was the highlight of the trip for me. I Went during off season so not many people around and it was nice to walk around without having to qeue for anything.
70,"Really pretty, but really crowded",You don't come here to not see this forest . Must do and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  There are waits with buses up and down along the trails.
71,จะเที่ยวให้ครบ ควรใช้เวลา 3 วันเต็ม,"I went during the low season, still crowded to me.. due to the noisy crowd, honestly.. ruin the beautiful supposedly peaceful & quiet nature.. it is beautiful, but I just will not be able to enjoy totally."
72,Nature,"**BEWARE OF DISGUISED TOUTERS, TAXI, AND FAKE TOURIST CENTERS**I like to explore places at my own pace and value opinions of locals. I'd say I have some level of street-smart and can smell touters from far away. This is the first place where touting has invaded the society at such a level that scares me. The hotel recommended me a local eatery (nondescript, popular local chain, none of the bells and whistles of a tourist-catering restaurant) where I was served by a smiley lady. She took orders, served food, chatted us up, and told us we can't book tickets at the venue (untrue),Tianmen Mountain entrance is too far (untrue), and to take a cab there. We rejected street touters on the way, got in the taxi who brought us to an official-looking building (we told the taxi driver we wanted to buy tickets). The building reads ""Tourist Information Center"" in Chinese - we later found several more around. There, the staff told us tickets are only available for very late afternoon (untrue), and it would be very hard to get out of the park in one day (untrue). So far, everybody has the same consistent story but this smells too much like a scam so we walked away, but not without having let them photocopy our passport first. Back in the city, we further experienced aggressive street touters who will follow you to the edge of their ""territory"", ""fakers"" who will pretend to chase off said touters and point you to the wrong direction towards other touters. Real locals however, are terrified to give us direction in the core city area. TL;DR; Be careful of touters because they can be in cahoots with local restaurants, taxi drivers, and maybe even some hotels. They can also pretend to be helpful locals and give wrong directions.Unguided travel - Zhangjiajie is very do-able without a guide. To get there, enter the entrance right beside the train station and you will be able to take a public bus costing 12RMB to Forest Park Ticket Entrance (森林公园门票站). The bus will bring you near the park entrance. Just walk along the road for another 5 minutes or so to reach the park entrance. There, buy tickets from the booth (available to foreigners for immediate entrance) which gives you a 3-day pass. If you are there early (reached before 10am), a full-day trip is possible. I'd recommend to visit Golden Whip Stream, walk up YuanJiaJie, take the eco bus to Tianzi Mountain, and choose your preferred mode down the mountain. From there, you can take the eco bus to the nearest exit, which has several names: 标志们门票站/武陵源门票站/吴家峪门票站 (respectively: Standard Entrance, Wulinyuan entrance and Wujiayu entrance). Recommended to get out at ~6pm, which means to start climbing down Tianzi Mountain at 3pm, or take the Cableway down at 5pm. This is do-able in one day if you start in the morning and have normal fitness level. From that entrance, enter ""汽车站“ into Baidu Maps and find your way there (~10mins walk). You can then buy tickets back to Zhangjiajie for 14RMB. The trip will take less than an hour. Weather - Zhangjiajie is prone to rain, so prepare for that or check the weather forecast. It is not very high up, so the temperature is similar to that of the city. T-shirt and shorts suffice for summer. Food and drinks - There are some food and drink options along the way, we had very nice jelly from one of the vendors in the mountain. Most of it is near the ecobus stop. Monkeys - the monkeys can be aggressive, especially in groups. Many tourists like to feed them so they are not scared of humans. Despite us carrying no food with us, the monkeys tried to climb onto us and I got a small scratch in the process."
73,Heavens Rock Gardens,"Second time going to Zhangjiajie and always impressed by the size and the Sceneries displayed in this natural wonder. First of all, I believe there is no specific season to visit the park. I have been there is September and March, and both months were quite enjoyable, Sept being a little bit hot and wet however. 3-4 days in the area is quite enough to see the main point of interest : the national park,l (2 days), Tianmen and the canyon. You can sleep the first 2 nights in Wulingyuan, close to the entry of the park. (Taxi from airport to Wulingyuan: ~100-150元, 40mn).You will find water and food in the park. Generally the walking path is easy and well indicated.Day 1: take your 4 days tickets to ZJJ park (220元pp). You can take the bus to Tianzi mountain cable way (78元pp). Just enjoy the view from the cable way and from the top, then take a second bus to Tianzi mountain (10mn, all bus are free), you can stroll around, and enjoy the first landscapes. (There is also a McDonald's for those looking for some Western food). When you are done, a second bus will bring you Yangjiajie cableway/village (30mn ride). From here you can enjoy a 30mn/1hr walk, far from most tourists, by turning left when arriving in front of the cableway. You will go down the stairs and then need to look to the path to a ""step to heaven"". Be prepared to climb stairs, but the calm up there is worth it. A last bus will drive you to Yuanjiajie, where the most famous landscapes are visible (avatar mountain, rock bridge). Be prepared to a lot of tourists. When done, you can either take a bus to Bailing elevator, but I would recommend to go down by the path (1hr walk) until you reach the water stream. There turn left and simply follow the river to the bus station (1 hr walk). You will see incredible landscapes if you choose this small trek. seeing all the pillars from below may be more impressive. A bus will bring you back to East entre. Enjoy a well deserved rest at your hotel. Day 2: my recommendation is to head to Huangshi village, less famous than the other part of park, but almost as good, and really quiet compared to day 1. Take a taxi/didi to Huangshi village (west entry), then head to the cableway (68 元pp). You will need ~2hrs to do the upper part, then you can either go down with the cableway or walk down (2hrs). You can take a taxi back to Wulingyuan or walk along the river to Bailong elevator and from there take the bus to East entry. Day 3: Tianmen was quite an enjoyable surprise,you will need one day to visit it. Don't be afraid of the price (258元pp). Otherwise the canyon may be interesting, but I have heard the glass is not that transparent anymore."
74,Bruce Tain great private tour guide,"The Bailong Sightseeing Elevator is very quick (and they really pack you in). We exited at the top of the mountain, took several pictures at the first viewing point, then continued walking around and gaping at the amazing rock formations and views. This was our favorite place in our whole trip to four cities in China."
75,Get there early to beat the Chinese tour groups!,"We spent a lovely three days In the Zhangjiajie Park. (I wouldn’t do any more than that) We stayed In a place called “Mini Inn” near the Yuangjiajie entrance to the park, it was the most amazing inn, very close to the trails, serving cheap amazing food and offering amazing customer service. Getting into the park costs 255 yuan but we used our student cards and got in for 125. When in the park we realised the orange roots were essentially motorways for people. Crowded and irritating but we discovered the green roots (marked on the maps) which were almost entirely empty and beautifully scenic. We even asked a local up in the hills for a different root and he pointed us towards an abandoned trail that looped around the mountains making it feel like a true adventure The place is increasingly touristy and areas are already spoiled by the numbers of tourists (especially the avatar mountain area) but as soon as you leave these routes it is once again an absolute gem!"
76,The Glass-floor bridge was a very big disappointment,We had rain and it was really cold. Good thing not too many people so no queuing !The lake is nice to do.
77,Nice but avoid this period of tome,"This is a very stunning place to go and I can see why people like to spend multiple days here, lots of cool mountains and scenery that you can only ever see here. But oh my god the crowds are the worst, so many people along tight pathways 3000ft high who are pushing all the time made it unenjoyable, people here didn’t seem to have any manners."
78,"Fantastic, did not disappoint in any way!!","Our tour of Zhangjiajie is one of the highlights of our 17-day trip in China. Walking the 999 steps up and down, seeing in person the Heavens Gate and the coiling road of 99 turns, experiencing the thrill of walking the coiling dragon glass walk and the Grand Canyon Glass bridge; be there in person to admire the amazing Avatar mountain we thought only in movies is it possible; all were next to nothing. The expertise of our guide, the effervescent Lingling  who knows how to to steer us out of unbelievable crowd helped us got the most of this national treasure."
79,Trip to Zhangjiajie with English-speaking Chinese guides,"I visited here as part of a 32-day solo holiday with China Private Tours.Though there seem to be multiple names for the same thing, people come to Zhangjiagie for two areas – the forest with the Avatar spires and Tianmen Mountain closer to the city. Judging by many of the photos of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park on this site, I wasn’t really unlucky to encounter a misty day. It is a shame that sun is not the norm because it would add to the experience. The fog was pretty bad and the view from the high lookouts was very limited. Things improved a little when I got to the glass elevator and the rocky spires were actually visible as we descended. At the bottom there is a train-type vehicle which transports you to a better view of the mountains and the ride itself offers good views as well. This is where I obtained my most fog-free vistas of the dozens of pinnacles that make up some of the stone forest. Obviously if you make the effort to come to this part of China, you’re going to come here whatever the weather and you’ll have to make the best of it. It’s in the hands of the Gods. For me, it was disappointing the high lookouts were a waste of time but at least I did see something while there. If the valley views had been fogged out as well, I would have been cursing. But if the Forest is on your itinerary, you have to be prepared that it might be brilliant or it might be awful. The forest park is about an hour’s drive from the main town."
80,Beautiful national park,"Although it was crowded,  we enjoyed it. Very well organized with shuttle service. No guide needed. Homestay possible within the park"
81,"Mad crowds, but vistas are worth it. Recommend a local guide","This place is very beautiful..awesome. easy to reach from city by bus. BUT when you get in...its confusing. No english signage for bus route... just get in in one to another bus without know where we will go. Its will be better if there is aroute, such as :  area 1 go to...., area 2 go to.... .. etcWe very confuse when we want to change our trip to yuenjiajie(avatar mountain) from wullingyuan area...no signage..no info what we should do.. there is amap but just map without information.. ! 1 of The interchange area from wullingyuan mt to avatar mt is in area Helong park. Just walk to the left side you will find a bazar area. Here it is! Find the cream mini car, take it about 45 minutes ..The car for each area is bus(wullingyuan or avatar) but the interchange car to move beetwen two mountain is minivan( cream color). If you want to chage the mountain use it.. The last trip in wullingyuan(we cone back fr avatar with last van at 5 pm, the van stop in cable car area. we must take it and pay.. from this point no car to go back to wullingyuan entrance. Bus and mini van is free facility"
82,"Glad I went, but horrible crowds","If you are looking for natural beauty, this place is a must-see for unique and breathtaking views. I traveled with my father and a guide, and was shocked to see that the sites had met my expectations in terms of their magnificence. The one caveat that detracted from the perfect experience were the lines of pushy, aggressive people that cannot be avoided when traveling in peak times. If you go, I recommend that you travel during non-peak seasons for the best experience."
83,Breathtaking place!,"I qwill rate 5* for the scenery, but the ticket prices here really made me unsatisfied, especially the elevator fee. 72 rmb just for one way and they dont remind when you buy ticket about it. On ticket its all written by Chinese so of course foreigners like me cant understand. Spend a day to explore the route: bailong elevator - gigantic natural bridge - wuilong village - tiamen mountain then remember to HIKE back if you still have time or CATCH a cable car back to town, DO NOT go back by the old way cause you will have to pay elevator fee AGAIN with ridiculous price similar with cable car and took much longer time cause you will have to stop every tourist spots then find return bus"
84,You need to come in all seasons,"Having had the privilege of traveling to various parts of the world, I was taken back by Trip Advisors remarks on how rude and pushy the Chinese people are.  Before you point a finger at someone else, take a lot at your own.....at least in China they don't go into schools and murder their children....or in churches or synagogues.  How will the world ever learn to respect others and their culture with remarks like this.  I would NEVER use your services - ever."
85,Gorgeous!,"We had very high expectations for this park. Was supposed to be the highlight of our trip to China. However, due to the rudeness of the Chinese tourists, rudeness and incompetence of park's staff, expensive cable cars, elevator (you pay a very expensive entry ticket that gives you right to free buses in the park but that's it), not clear signage/maps unfortunately it wasn't a great experience but only an average experience. The most frustrating thing was the difficulty to understand where to take a bus and where the bus would stop. No clear signs/maps and no member of the staff willing to help you out (most of them busy sleeping or playing at the phone). Stunning scenery but... I wouldn't go back! :( I am surprised a UNESCO heritage site is managed so badly."
86,Must see if in China,"Zhangjiajie stole my heart, definitely one of my favorite places I have been. I would like to go back to spend longer time.Definitely plan to stay at least 2 or 3 days to spend there, because it is large beautiful place, also the entrance tickets is valid for for 4 days. if you are traveling alone or with friends and want to visit the place on your own, I recommend to learn Chinese, or better hire a tour, because there not people who speak english at all. Also, have in your phones downloaded translator, which at least will help to ask some questions. Better, both written and spoken, it will be very helpful in many places in China.The place will be always crowded, especially by Chinese tourist or groups. and avoid going during Chinese holidays, they say that it is so crowded."
87,Road less traveled ,We went to the national forest on a raining day so not many people at all.  The bus ride there was ok not great but ok.  We arrived  and then brought the tickets then tried to find our way to the cable car took another bus up where we sat on the bus for 15mins while the driver slept :/. We had no idea  what was happening pure laziness is what I put it down to because the park was empty felt the need not to drive at all..    Foggy couldn't see a thing .  People selling rain coats  and in your face was crazy.   The bus ride home well my mum gave the guy the money we needed change  the guy hands mum all the money back and of course you have no idea why because of the language barrier then mum trys to explain you didn't take any money then the man starts shouting sit down sit down.   These man already seated asked what happened can we help thankfully they were on this bus because police hopped on few stops down..  n they sorted it out for us n the whole issue was because mum handed him the money n not put it in the clear plastic box they thought we wanted a free ride.   Was an awful experience  because we were in the  middle on nowhere 45mins back to the hotel n a bus full of non english speaking people.    Was very glad to get off the bus but it did scare us so we cancelled another bit of our trip because that was a 4 hr bus ride god know what would have happened if we got stuck on that 1    Generally the people were amazing always willing to help you out if they can...
88,Stunning ,Very spectacular scenary. The cable car to the mountain is an excellent architecture. The view was scary coz it is very high but it is probably the longest cable car in the world. Coming down was a put off though. The crowd management was so poor. The rushing to the bus was terrible.
89,Lovely,"This is one of the most spectacular landscapes I have ever seen. The mountains are very unusual in shape, the park is beautifully laid out and the paths comfortably paved. We were very fortunate to be there in March, before, the season started and therefore, we had no lines. Everything was supremely accessible.I think that it is very useful to go with a guide because everything is in Chinese and there is no English anywhere. Our guide knew the terrain very well and showed us the most beautiful areas. Since there were relatively few people, we were able to meander at will and did not have to wait to see the many attractions. The weather was good in March to see this spectacular mountain range."
90,Wonderful Sceneries of Zhangjiajie,"This place is amazing and well worth a visit. Such amazing scenery and views. So baring this in mind I'll go into a bit more detail with things to be aware of.Firstly the park opens well before 7am.I arrived at the park about 6:50am and there was already lots of people there being let in.For the most part there is really good signage as to where to go. There are a couple of the bus stops that don't have English but there's pretty much always someone to ask.The queue for tickets goes down quickly, tickets are 228¥ (hotels might try selling you a ticket to ""beat the queues"" but they will over charged so it's not worth it.) The ticket lasts for 4 days.Secondly, it is always busy pretty much everywhere. Even when it's not busy there is still a crowd to push pass to get a good picture, but be rude and push pass them, otherwise you will be waiting a long time.There are plenty of facilities at intervals along all the routes even the steep stair routes have toilets and food stalks along the way.You have to use the buses and you have to queue there's no getting round this but the queues go quickly for the most part.All of the routes are well marked and have good footing. However they are long so wear sensible shoes (the amount of Chinese tourists wearing flip flops is surprising).There are multiple ways to the upper routes, 2 walking, 1 elevator and 2 cable cars (that I came across anyway) you have to pay for the cable cars and elevator individually which are about 60-80 ¥ which isn't too much really.The route I took the first day took me up the elevator, there was initially a queue for the first stage you go up but for the second and glass elevator there was no queue so I got close the window and it was a great view.I then took the bus round to the enchanting view which was great, again not too crowded early.You can walk round to the natural bridge from here. If you're there early then it's worth a walk round. On the way there are a few spots with quiet viewpoints. There are a couple of points where there are Y junctions that get pretty cramped with people pushing and shoving, be bold and push through, there is no other way. The worst was the junction before the natural bridge you either go up to bypass the bridge or go left to go over. Once over it's bit too crowded. Once over go upwards but rather than going to the peak go around and there's some quite spots with great views.Follow signs to the car park to get the bus to the next stop.Yangjiajie is the next stop with the great Wall of natural, and tianbo mansion.The wall is worth a look but not the best view.I would about the trek to tianbo. It is steep with a route that has well worn stones that are slippy that make an already dicey route even worse. There's also very slim gaps through rocks. Push through these and you end with a climb up very questionable ladders to a lookout that isn't that amazing, the climb is vertical so if aren't great with heights don't bother. Another tip, if you do this route rather than waiting for people going up and down there a route round the base so go down but then go round not up.The route back from here is also not great so as I say avoid if you aren't looking to push yourself.From the Yangjiajie stop you can get a bus to tianzi mountain.  This has some great views and is worth a wander around.This is also where there is a McDonald's. There's also a tower you can climb that was free and not too crowded.The best views were down past the tower, they were also pretty much empty.Next tip, the bus stop going from tianzi mountain to Yangjiajie was always ridiculously busy whenever ever I passed so avoid going this route.From tianzi mountain I got the bus to the cable car and down and this was great as the views were amazing and I got a car to myself.Day 2 I walked the golden whip stream which was nice and quiet early on I walked along and then back to the step up luancuan slope. This is a tough climb, over 2000 steps, an hour of steps with no flat. It was very difficult and to be honest but really worth the effort, the only views are at the top.Next tip before going to the enchanting viewpoint, head between the shops following signs down, go along and there's some great views with no one there. There are monkeys though. Most were fine but 1 did try and jump for a guys backpack.Day 3 I was extremely tired so just popped in to see the 10 mile natural gallery (not 10 miles at all) I went here first thing at 6:50 and there were already crowds of tour groups. You can walk or get a monorail which you pay for. I walked and the route is awful. It's totally flat but it's a railed walkway where you can only walk 2 people wide, this is the up and down route so you have tours stopping and tours coming down and people pushing passed. It's not a pleasant walk at all and the views were good but not essential.Rather than heading back down this route you can take steps to the tianzi mountain section. I didn't do this but it might have been worth it to avoid going back the way I came in.Next tip, apart from the buses, don't queue, Chinese tourists will randomly stop along routes for no reason or to admire a view for a long time. Push passed and stay ahead of the crowds, especially tour groups.Be prepared to get your photo taken. I'm a white guy with a beard which the Chinese find  facinating. But don't be afraid to say no, if you really don't want to just walk away. It is more fun to just embrace it but if you are hot and sweaty it can be too much.In conclusion it's definitely worth a visit as the views are breathtaking. But be prepared for crowds and plan your route carefully. Know what you want to see and the best route to get there."
91,2 nights 2.5 days,A very unique experience .challenge your brave by crossing the glass  bridge.walking down from the mountain by stairs. a long path way crossing the valley.enjoy the sight and breath in the highest Ionic created by the natural.
92,The greatest scenery I’ve seen in my life,"Title says it all. Inside the park there were mini-trains, hundreds of buses, 3 cable cars, and an elevator built into a mountain. Ridiculous. Not to mention the huge our groups with megaphones. There were signs to not disturb the monkeys, but what were the Chinese tourists doing? Throwing things at them, screaming at them, feeding them, and getting dangerously close for photos. Yes, the park is very beautiful. So if you can handle all that, plus the ridiculous prices, then go for it. The best part was the Golden Whip Stream because it got much less busy the farther you went in. Still paved though, which takes away from the hike. I’d visit smaller places any day before ever coming back here again."
93,BREATHTAKING SCENERY...,"We did this area in one day, but we were really rushed.  The views are amazing, but it has huge lines for everything.  We got a four day pass and I think that is the right way to do this, over several days.  Glad we went though"
94,Too busy and expensive tickets everywhere,"I went on May 1st--China's Labor Day. My hotel informed me that the park opens at 6:30am but I'm not sure if it's always open this open or if the hours are because of the holiday, so I recommend double checking for yourself. Definitely get there as early as you can! I got to the Ten-Mile Gallery at about 7:40am and I found about 5 Chinese tour groups in front of me. I was able to get pass them and my experience was improved ten-fold because once I got ahead of the crowds, I was hiking with nobody in sight the majority of the time. Which means I didn't have to wait for anybody on the steps or jostle for a view from the lookouts. In one day, from 7:40am-4:10pm (8.5 hours), I was able to hit the Ten-Mile Gallery, Tianzi Mountain, Avatar Mountains, and Golden Whip Stream, in that order. However it was extremely tiring fitting all that in one day and I ended up walking/hiking a total of over 14 miles; many of those miles were up or down steps. So, I'd recommend spending 2 days in the National Park (of course you can do more if you have the time). If you only have 1 day to spend in the park, then my itinerary is doable but very tiring. Day 1: From the Wulingyuan entrance, take the free shuttle bus to the Ten-Mile Gallery (which is actually 3.6 miles). From the Ten-Mile Gallery to Tianzi Mountain, it's an uphill hike and will take about 2-2.5 miles to climb. Arrive at Tianzi Mountain, where there are a couple of cool lookouts, street vendors, restrooms, and even a McDonald's. After exploring Tianzi Mountain, you can take a free shuttle bus to the Avatar Mountains. The ride took approximately 40 minutes. It was extremely crowded at a few parts of the Avatar Mountains but the views were well worth it. Explore Avatar Mountains and then head back to your hotel to rest. Day 2: From the Zhangjiajie entrance, you can easily access the Yellow Stone Village and the Golden Whip Stream. You'll encounter a lot of monkeys in this area so be careful about concealing your food if you don't want it snatched from you. Tips: - Get there early! - 1/2 price off admission tickets if you have a student ID- If you end up at the Zhangjiajie gate like I did but need to get back to Wulingyuan, there's a bus that costs 10 kuai about 800 meters from the Zhangjiajie gate. The ride is 30 minutes long"
95,Beautiful parks,"One of the best trips I have ever done. Walking in the park is very demanding, but it is amazing and worth each drop of sweat. Bring water, food and enjoy one of the most fantastic views you'll have in your life!(I went there on July 2016)"
96,beautiful NP and incredible scenery!,"I had the absolute best 4 days in the park, my experience was possibly enhanced by the expertise of a local English speaking guide which definitely made it quicker & easier for me to experience everything I desired, would highly recommend doing this as language barrier would otherwise make it a little frustrating.  My guide always ensured I had the best views & managed to get me a seat on all transport but as I had already had 2 weeks travelling around China I had learnt to push my way in politely.  I certainly wasn't disappointed with the spectacular scenery, although a little hot at times in the high 30s  in August but the further I went up the mountain the cooler it became which was very welcome.  This area is truly worth a visit but you do need some walking fitness as there are a lot of steps for example one day I climbed up & down about 4000 steps which at 64 I was more than capable of due to my bushwalking fitness."
97,Ethereal experience,"Magnificent park with excellent public transport organisation by bus inside the park. We used the Bailong lift to change ""level"" and then descended by foot on a 3 hr hike along paved paths and thousands of stairs. Tiring, but a wonderful experience that we wouldn't hesitate to repeat."
98,You have to see this place to believe it,"If you enjoy sceneries like those in Grand Canyon, then this place is a must!Ticket price of 245 RMB entitles you to 4 days of entry. As the place is huge, if you can afford the time, you should spread your visit over 3 to 4 days. Do note that the ticket price excludes cable car rides or the special ride up the tallest elevator in the lift. If you can spare the time, then you won't need to spend money on those. Else, be prepared to work out additional 100+ RMB to save you from the extra climb.The scenery is awesome. Words cannot describe the scenery that is said to have inspired the backdrop for Avatar. So come prepared to take a lot of photos.Come prepared with walking shoes as there will be a lot of it. Bring along a bottle of water and some snacks, albeit you can buy those within the park. There is even a KFC and McDonald's in the park!"
99,Visiting a Wonderful National Park with a Great Tour Guide,"Make sure to get a good map of the park, couse it is big and alot is in chinese and hard to navigate in. Absolutely recommend going there. Make sure you have good weather, and that there is little fog."
100,This literally has to be seen and experienced to believe it really exists!,"Expect Disneyland crowds, seas of selfie sticks and hoards of chinese tourists barging past. Queues for everything are very long so you need to allocate a whole day to be able to see a few attractions. Views are stunning and incredible so it is a shame. Definitely worth visiting but truly frustrating in terms of numbers of tourists. I definitely recommend hiking (up/down/both) because it enriched my experience tenfold! You are truly with nature and not a bunch of squabbling/shouting Chinese armed with Megaphones and flags."
101,Unforgettable experience!,"We visited the park in October. The scenery is absolutely stunning. The walks are all paved - a feat in itself!We loved the amazing views from the tops of the peaks, especially as the sun was lowering in the sky, but also the views of the peaks from the riverside paths below. We bought a four day pass, and as long as you avoid the “rush hour” getting in wasn’t bad. The buses are free inside the park and you can get on and off wherever you like. Obviously if you go to the Avatar section it is absolutely heaving with throngs of tourists, but we spent hours walking where we only saw a handful of people all day. The cables cars are amazing if you can get past the gut-wrenching drop below you! Golden Whip stream is a beautiful walk."
102,Amazing !!!!,"Majestic view of the mountain range.We did an overnight tour of the forest park. Having a guide also helps as this gives us more time to enjoy the various section of the park.As we were travelling in late November, the weather is a bid on the cold side, but the plus side is that it is not crowded.A BBQ restaurant would help to make the evening more enjoyable to go with the hot tea or drinks. But we did not managed to find one near our hotel.."
103,"Epic Landscape, Experience Weather-Dependent","Mob scene on the weekends, but the vistas and mountains are worth being pushed by the many Chinese. Well run system with white shuttle bus, cable car and glass elevators available to help you navigate the scenic points if you do not want to just hike."
104,Breathtaking,"Entrance during busy season is 225 yuan and very much worth it. We took a Didi to the Southgate, entered to the Oxygen Square, took a short bus ride and went up the Huangshi Cable Car to the Golden Rock Village which was another 65 yuan. Very worth it and an intermediate hike down with some slippery steps. There is mist around the pillar mountains but you will get many good panoramic views up here! We would highly suggest the cable car up unless you want to murder your legs.We took a break after the hike down at the Oxygen Square then hiked the Golden Whip Scenic Area trail which is a very easy 6 km walk alongside a stream it is quite cool in this area in July. This will get you to the Four Streams Crossroad where you can take a bus to the Baoling Elevator. Baoling Elevator is 65 yuan to get to the top and you can see the 48 peaks which inspired the floating mountains in the Avatar movie. We opted out of this as a friend told us the staircase down is very steep and slippery. The views from the bottom are pretty good too. We then took a bus to the magnificent east gate and Wulingyan Downtown. The East Gate is very busy with western food choices like Starbucks and KFC. From here you can take a Didi back to town for around 120 yuan or take a bus to the Zhangjiajie Bus Station for around 20 yuan.We would recommend entering through the South Gate as it is less busy and touristy and gives you very immediate access to the scenery. The bus ride from the Baoling Elevator area to the east gate is about half an hour. Once inside the park the busses are free but you have to pay extra for cable cars and elevators. The price of food and drinks are fair in most areas but you might be able to negotiate a better price if the prices are not posted. Bathrooms are plentiful but toilet paper is not. Make sure you bring some!"
105,Large and stunning park,"My wife and I spent three days at the Zhangjiajie National Park (known as the Avatar Mountain area) visiting this wonderland and with the help of our tour Guide Kelly and her husband Chris we had a wonderful experience visiting this park. This Park covers an area of 264 square kilometers, famous for its unique peaks, tranquil water, and beautiful green forests. Its main scenic spots include the Golden Whip Stream, the Yellow Stone Village, Yuanjiajie Avatar Mountain, Tianzi Mountain, Yangjiajie, Wulong Village, Shili Painting Gallery, Yaozi Zhai and so on.   Most of the times the park is filled with a large number tourist standing in a long line to either buy the entrance tickets, enter the park, ride the cable care, ride the busses, and take the elevator. Many of the upper portions of the parks can be accessed by hiking. Climbing over 2000 feet to reach the top of the peak was very difficult for us and we could not do it by ourselves. We made the right decision and we hired Chris and Kelly as our tour guide.  Our tour guide recommended that rather than hiking over 4 to 6 miles and climbing over 3,000 steps  we start our tour from the peak by taking a long cable car and walk from to top toward the bottom of the mountain. They picked us up from the hotel with their SUV van and  for the three days that we were in the Zhangjiajie area they took us to the city, to the Wulinggyuan Wujiayu entrances of the Tianzi Mountain, and to the Tisnmen Mountain entrance. They even took us to see a Chinese cultural show in the evening and they drop us off at the airport after we completed the tour of the national park. Their SUV was very clean fairly new, and in their car, they had a cooler felled with water and soft drinks, snacks, fruit. They had Wifi available for us and we were able to communicate with our family right from the park sending them pictures of these lovely sceneries.Our tour guides were very pleasant, very helpful, very knowledgeable professional, and they were fun to be with. They were attentive to our needs, their communication was in English and we never had any problem communicating with them. They were well organized; they purchased the tickets before we reached the park so we did not have to wait in the long line to buy tickets. They selected the less crowded route allowing us to spend more time on the observation platform to see these beautiful sceneries without being pushed by a large group of tourists who also wanted to use the observation platform. Their time management was excelled.  They were familiar with the park and provided us with lots of background information about the city of Zhangjiajie, and the origin of each place in the park. Without our tour guide, it was very difficult for us to find many of this information from Google or any other online searches or publications. We learned a lot about each scenery in the park and learn greatly about the local culture. Chris was nice enough to carry a heavy bag of water, snacks, and fruit to make sure we drink enough water and snacks to have the necessary energies to walk for over 8 to 10 hours. We enjoyed and loved the Glass Bridge, Tianmen Mountain and the National Zhangjiajie sandstone forest and the city of Zhangjiajie. We had a great experience all the way around! In short, our tour guides were fantastic! We highly recommend Kelly and Chris to anyone who plans to visit the Zhangjiajie National Park. If you are looking for a great guide in Zhangjiajie, you can't go wrong with Kelly and Chris."
106,Excellent,"Zhangjiajie was not on my itinerary but having seen a photo on someone's phone I changed my route.....I did not regret that decision, it's absolutely magnificent. The ticket is expensive, and they do not give reductions for over 60s, although they did on cable cars, wave your passport! The ticket is valid for four days and it's well worth spending more than one day, I stayed in a hostel at the top for two days, or there is accommodation just outside the gates. There are many Chinese tour groups with their amplified commentary, usually around Avatar mountain, but it is possible to get away to somewhere quieter, climbing up and down the inevitable steps. The weather changes constantly, the mountains emerging and disappearing in the mist. It can be cold at the top, so take adequate clothing. My hostel had no heating but it did have an electric blanket."
107,Nice views but difficult to travel around if not Chinese speaker,"I visited Hunan province in China in November and this was the highlight of the trip. Even though the weather was not great - misty and raining most of the time - it was an incredible experience. I could not believe that a place so incredible really existed - and even though like many others, I had seen it in the Avatar movie I thought that the reality could not be as amazing. Well I was more than wrong. I still cannot believe that a place like this existsThe park is incredibly well maintained and the even the trash cans are tastefully designed to blend in with the surroundings. What was impressive was the fact that a natural wonder has been so well managed that even though there were literally busloads of visitors at the time of our visit (all areas over a period of 3 days) it never felt over crowded."
108,Enormous National Park,"Magnificent place to be. One of the most scenic areas ever seen. Select a hotel with at least 4-5 stars to receive some comfort. A 4 star in Zhangjiajie is a 2 to 3 star in Shanghai. Tip: Organize your total tour via the reception of your hotel. Maps and advises about how to proceed are available at the reception. Bus depart to one of the gates of the park are often located nearby your hotel, a taxi is a good alternative. Buy a 4? days park entrance ticket at one of the gates. It provides free bus transfer in the park to all highlights. At every ""highlight-stop"" you can buy necessary tickets, if required. Mind the festival- / national holidays etc. to avoid too many visitors and very long waiting times at every scenic location. The area is beautiful, even when it rains."
109,Vast National Park with Spectacular view,"We were a group of international tourists comprising of friends and relatives: 2 from Melbourne Australia, 2 from Vancouver Canada, 2 from Singapore and 3 from Malaysia. On 17th October 2018 we flew into Changsha. There we were met by our appointed tour guide, Ms Venus Loong of CITS. She was 31 years old and was highly recommended by tourists and received glorifying reviews in Tripadvisor on Zhangjiajie National Park. Based on this, we contacted her through email initially and later with WeChat. We soon found out she was indeed very helpful, cheerful and warm and ably drew up a comprehensive 8 days tour for Zhangjiajie, Fenghuang and Changsha as per our desired itineraries. She gave excellent feedback and tips to our proposed itineraries and we went through numerous changes and she always did it with same enthusiasm. She helped us to book hotels and arranged transport requirement for our whole journey. When we had some problems in booking train tickets from Changsha to Shenzhen over the internet, she volunteered to book all the tickets for us without any hesitation.On the first day of our journey from Changsha to Zhangjiajie our bus front tyre was accidentally punctured after half an hour into the journey. Within 15 minutes, a tow truck arrived and towed our bus to a nearby tyre shop for repair. At the same time Ms Venus Loong booked 2 Grab Taxi taking us to a nearby restaurant and ordered lunch for all of us insisting that the lunch bill and taxi will be picked up by her and not charge to us. We were really amazed by her efficiency and kindness. It touched our hearts and we appreciated very much for that kind gesture of her.Our arrangement with Ms Venus is that we would pay all meals by ourselves as we liked to venture into different types of food that were available. Ms Venus excelled in this department, always gave us great suggestions and tips and we enjoyed thoroughly the food and help us to save on the bill.Our tour programme was comprehensive covering Tianmen, Fairy Fox show, Wullingyuan-Zhangjiajie areas, Tianzishan, Glass Bridge, Tujia Museum and 2 nights in Fenghuang and 1 night at Changsha. We have a memorable time and enjoy every minutes of our stay there. I am 71 years old man from Malaysia. I have travelled many parts of China over the last 15 years. I can sincerely said that this is one of my best trip and Ms Venus Loong is surely a part to this memorable experience. Prior to this trip, I do not know Ms Venus but after this, both my wife and I were touched by her honesty, sincerity and kindness and we will remember her for a long time."
110,amazing views,"The day we went was a beautiful sunny day of April 10, 2018. We are backpackers. Organized own trip. Don't speak Chinese was little hard. Took a local bus to Forest Park from the Bus station nearby Train station. It took more than an hour to get there. And we walked to the Ticket office and bought tickets for 4 days. We didn't know they provide only 4 days tickets. If you have enough time to stay there get a hotel in Wulingyuan District and go to this Park for up to 4 days. We hiked about 4 hours because my friend refused to take a cable car. It was nice, but of course long walk. If you like nature and hiking, definitely to visit this place.Be careful with monkeys they steal everything."
111,elevator is not worth it!,"This is a truly unique experience.  It was old sea ground, which spurted up, and has come to life in its second act.  Each rock formation jetting out has its own personality.  There are different sections of the park.  There's the quintisennital shot in every Chinese brochure of the loan rock formation w/ a tree on top, the Stone Forest Section, and of course the avatar section.  The park is big, and is very well run.  Buses can take you to every where you would like to go.  Is a must stop through!"
112,Great Views,"This is a huge park, and well worth spending 2 to 3 days. We did this without a guide, which was easy to do: lot of english signs for the buses, but you have to be super observant since no one speaks english but people are super helpful if you can figure out  way to communicate (hand gestures or wechat, etc)"
113,Splendid view with nice infrastructure,"This place is so stunning with the different views and it looks like from a different world. If you are up in the mountains or down in the jungle, you will see amazing things. Although 2 days might be enough we recommend to plan 3 days and enjoy the area without a rush. The rush will come itself as the place is so crowded with people. So go there early in the morning and enjoy some time before the masses enter the park."
114,Nice Avatar Mountains,Best place to see natural beauty at its beauty. A must see location in hunan province. Beautiful naturally occurred locations. Best time to go is morning and whole day can be spent leisurely
115,its heaven on the earth where floating trees speak.,"We were delighted to be invited to join some friends to visit the famous Avatar floating mountains. It did not disappoint- there was even the world highest scenic elevator to bring you up to a viewpoint.  Simply Amazing. unfortunately was cloudy all day and no burst of sunlight to shine on the mountain.  The light rain contributed to the foggy look of the mountain- beautiful. Could have come back for a day 2 , just to have better light o the floating mountains. entrance not cheap - about RMB 245 ($30)"
116,Beautiful park,Fantastic scenery amidst the mountain that inspire avatar scenes. Really enjoy the nature wonders that’s so unique. We come on the day it snow so ground is wet. But the air is crisp and the walk was refreshing. The crowd is not huge so we have lots of photo opportunities. Take time to wonder around and absorb in nature’s wonders.
117,Amazing and spectacular scenery,"We entered through ZJJ national forest park (South Gate) and took a cable car up and down Huang Shi Mountain. Then we went to Yang Jia Jie using a one direction cable car, then to Yuan Jia Jie. The Avatar mountain is located beside the First Bridge Of The World, on a platform called Mi Hun Tai. It is awesome! I really wonder how the mountain won’t fall. It is so thin and Long. It really is so cool!"
118,Majestic view..,Incredible limestone formations that can be viewed and it was crowded but luckily manage to take some good photos without any of them in the frame.  Enjoy the breeze and tranquility
119,Beautiful,"The views in China’s national park are amazing. The mountains were the inspiration in James Cameron’s movie, Avatar. Very inspiring."
120,Fantastic - the only kind. ,"This national forest is a must see, even if you didn't see the movie ""Avatar"". There are some beautiful walks you can do. Beware of the cheeky monkeys and the crowds. Cause just like anywhere in China it can be very busy.The views make more then up for that, so don't let that hold you back.Buses take you from one track to the other."
121,Spectacular scenery,A must see! Mountain peaks unlike any other we've seen. Just beautiful and untouched. Fog rolls in and out throughout the day so I suggest an early visit.
122,"Real, not  CGI.","Unforgetable Zhangjiajie with Avatar Mountain. Place to visit while you still can walk & climb. Spectacular view, very long way cable car (but long que), The longest elevetor through inside the mountain, Bailong Elevetor experiences. Must choose the correct month to get clear view, usually during summer, otherwise most of the time will be cloudy & foggy."
123,Interesting landscape - don't shop there,"Visited during the low season, attractions were not as crowded and lines for the cable car and elevator was not long. Only drawback was the weather, which was cold and drizzling.We took the cable car up to Tianzi mountain, shuttle bus to Yuanjiajie then the elavator down. The views are spectacular. My only regret was that we only had limited time to explore the park."
124,Pandora on Earth,My teacher friends and I visited during the Chinese National Holiday (first week of October) and it surprisingly was not too overcrowded! The entire forest park is HUGE and quite frankly two days is probably needed to see everything. The weather was cool and sunny (absolutely perfect for hiking). The climb is steep and a little strenuous; however the views are breathtaking and worth it. It’s definitely not a bad idea to take the cable car either up or down because walking both ways is exhausting.
125,Awesome Pristine National Forest Park that Rejuvenate Your Lungs.,Aviator was used for some of the pictures from here. scenery was spectacular and it was very east to get around only be able to speak English.
126,Simply magnificent views.,"Aug2018. Tall gigantic rock structures with super tall vertical sides. The wonderful thing is that we can easily access from the base all the way to the summits of most of the rocks (either by bus, or by a very very tall and long passenger lift). When we are at the summit and looking down over the sides, the view is straight down because of the vertical rock faces. Worthwhile visiting. FrancisTLim."
127,A must,"We had a guide , and definitely helped, especially with getting tickets, through the queue to the buses . The place is amazing, would take a week to see it properly"
128,spectacular,"Remember the Movie Avatar, it is where it was shot, so beautiful. it is one of kind, hard to use words to explain, unforgettable, our tour also leads us to Tianmen Mountain, famous longest glass bridge (430 meter long), the trip can’t end with visiting Phoenix ancient town about 3 hours away. A life time trip you will remember it forever! It you go with a tour group, normally 4 to 5 days will give you a lot to see. It is hard to go by your own. So many people, buying tickets, you may wonde around the mountain and come back to the same place, unless you have a lot of time."
129,Naturally Stunning,"Must see. Be ready to walk a lot , really a lot .Take your food once must part of food are very local and you may not enjoy it .Take with you a walking stick , it will be a bless to your knees and legs Forget selfies and just watch the wonder in front of you Take care with China southeast airline ... they just cancel the flight saying that is bad Weather ... I see....."
130,Beautiful Tianmen mountains in Zhangjiajie,"We were given a great tour of the national park and the amazing Yellow Dragon cave by Wendy Wu's local guide, LJ. He introduced us to delicious local food and was lovely company. Fascinating tour and excellent service. Highly recommended location and tour operator 😀"
131,Awesome park,"Five days in ZJJ with our awesome guide, Venus. Highly recommended to engage her service if anyone wants to visit ZJJ. Every secs of our 5days was well planned by her. We had visited and seen much more then what we had paid for.Planning and looking forward to visit ZJJ again during the Winter and ofcourse not forgetting our one and only Venus."
132,Great Stone Forest,"Lovely park, but it was so frustrating we didn't go back the second day.  We had a shuttle from our hotel (No 5 Valley Inn) to the West Entrance, and you then take a shuttle (after paying for the park fees in cash) to the cable car (expensive, the but alternative is a very windy road up - assuming you can figure out which bus to take.)  Once there, the maps on the boards made no sense - and could not be followed, trying to find understandable maps were hard to find.  You have to take a shuttle to other locations (I guess you could hike, but with no decent maps  I don't recommend it)  And there are 2 types, I still have no idea which one goes where.  You have to queue for the shuttle, which is in Chinese and even if you play ""match the symbol game"" none of the busses are marked with symbols.  So we did lots of riding around.  English not spoken (I understand that) but even the kind locals who tried help looking at bad maps and signs couldn't help point us in the proper direction.  Just overall a frustrating experience.  By taking the wrong bus (go figure) we ended up a the main entrance where all of the tourists groups come in.  The tourist groups are large and each one has a microphone and is very loud and it is hard to move around them.  This is the most scenic part and there is English on the signs, which helped but after we were done there - no English to guide us anywhere - so hop on a bus and hope for the best!We blindly found our way back, found others from our hotel (even one that had a Chinese guide) who experienced the same."
133,Fantastic place,"Z Park is one of the world's great natural sites, and Chinese authorities have done an excellent job of making it accessible. Still, it is not easily enjoyed, and the visitor should make serious preparations to get the most out of the visit.   Some general  tips:1. Give yourself enough time2. Do serious research on weather patterns and routes3. Get a good guide who can give you info and cut red tape4. Get there early every day5. If you have bad knees or other disabilities, be aware that there are a lot of stairs, even though there are spots where there are cable cars, mountain elevators and escalators, etc. There are still scores or even hundreds of stairs--up and down---that cannot be completely avoided.One should set aside three or four days and be willing to change plans because of inclement weather. The great mountains are often swathed in mist, especially when it is humid and hot, and there is often a lot of rain. We went in mid-june. In late June, after school lets out, the Chinese go on vacation and take their kids to Z Park and other national sites. This can get very crowded.     Westerners are advised to get a good local guide and driver who can cut some of ticket waiting time and red tape, some of the added waiting and long lines. It's worth it to spend a few extra dollars to save time and fatigue.    Going up and down the mountain trails was hot and sweaty. The trails are generally beautifully laid-out, with plenty of food and drink options along the way, but up on top, at 1,300 or so meters,  it can get cool. It  pays to take a wind-breaker or buy plastic rain coat (fairly cheap) along the way.    There are some days when it is hard to get a good view of the mountains and cavernous canyons, and the glass bridge itself is a bit of a disappointment. Still, the mountain views are spectacular, and Tien Minh Mountain itself is matchless.   For those who have been to other great national parks--Yellowstone, Bryce etc--this is still worth visit. It is really beautiful--like walking in a Chinese landscape painting."
134,no words can express the overwhelming experience,"I stayed in the park for two days and two point five days. I stayed in a local village opposite the elevator. The views from my accommodation were better than the ones open to the general public. It was also interesting to learn about their culture and try their food. You have to be prepared to hike up a lot of stairs. On my first day I walked 20 km, second day 15 km and 10 km on my final day. I found the bottom of the mountain to be overcrowded with tourists compared to the top.I found the views at the top of the mountain to be a lot better. I noticed that the prices for food and drink was largely depended on the seller for example the same bottle of water could set you back from 3 RMB to 10 RMB. I agree with everyone that says that the elevator (88 seconds) and cable car are expensive at 72 RMB for one way. I recommend you spend two days here off peak (November to March) and three plus days if you visit during peak season (April to October) due to crowds."
135,Breathtaking scenery,"Amazing in every way. The elevator, the forest walk and the cable trip all worth doing but you will need two full days."
136,Get a tour guide!,"We were able to see the rock formations from both above and from below. From above, one needs to take the cable car up and walk around the peaks. There is also a low level hike that lets one view the mountains from below. Don't miss the glass Bridge."
137,Mountain of mystique,"Without a doubt our favourite place in China. For a start the air is less polluted and you will see blue skies. The scenery in the park is stunning and if you get away from the main areas and find secluded paths you can go hours without seeing anyone else. Entry is expensive but covers four days and gives you access to a bus system.The cable cars are a money trap, but because theres no alternative way from the top to the bottom (other than hiking) be prepared pay if you find yourself up the top late in the day."
138,"Beautiful, but so crowded! ","We went there for a day although the entrance was for 4 days. The views were amazing and the park completely prepared, including a Mc’Donalds on the top!! There are some parts very crowded but another were really empty.  We took the cable car to the top and stop in all the possible places in the bus... for going down we tried the crystal lift.... We enjoyed a lot and the views were amazing!! 😉😉"
139,Must visit,"Pleasantly surprised by the National Park, first the Glass Bridge,  an amazing piece of architecture and breathtaking. Followed by the walk thru the Grand Canyon is relaxing and with enjoyable view."
140,The best national Park in China!,This really is a great park to visit and spend a day or so there. So much to do and even in the rain we enjoyed the visit. In sunshine it would be even better. Crowds were not too bad compared with other places and we moved easily around the park on the public transport
141,Beautiful but crowded,"Truly unique scenery, that can be highly atmospheric when shrouded in mist, or at sunrise and sunset. The cable cars (of which there are several) offer some great views (though be warned they can go up very high and if you don't have the head for heights, think carefully about it!).There are walking trails, that are often laid out paths to follow, so it's not exactly 'off the beaten track' but you can spend a few hours walking not  just around the mountains but also in the valley below.A lot of the routes are designed to be bus-sed from and too. Free buses travel the various routes and it's a good idea to plan out where you want to head for in advance, as well as where you can get back.Be warned. The park gets very busy and you will be fighting with multiple tour groups. These tend to stick to the main attractions and viewpoints, so if you do venture off on foot, you can escape them for a little while. But the reality of the park is that it is very popular as a destination. Queues for buses, lifts, cable cars are the norm."
142,Must go travel spot,"We just completed a 4 day trip to Zhangjiajie.The vistas are gorgeous, the place is well worth a visit. However the crowds were massive and quite aggressive (we often struggled to get seats on buses initially as there is little crowd control), I would highly recommend foreigners get a local guide because the park is massive and everything is written in mandarin. We also found stuff like the bailong elevator and glass bridge gimmicky, and it was the nature itself that was the selling point.Our itinerary was planned by Frank Chen and it was well organized. Last minute Zinia was appointed as our guide which left us a little apprehensive as we hadn't spoken to her, but she was amazing. She knows the language and the area well, but most of all she was very friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make us happy. Highly recommend Zinia and booking with Frank Chen (frankusa123@outlook.com)"
143,Real life Avatar land,"Awesome park, astonishing views.Just a couple of advices:1- It's still pretty unknown outside China, so the tourism is basically just Chinese. All indications are in Chinese and very few people (almost nobody) speak English. As the park is full of buses, it's very difficult to travel if you don't have a local guide.2- The weather is quite wet. 200 rainy days every years and very humid the rest. It’s not easy to find a sunny and dry day. However the mountains are great also with the fog (almost magical)I don’t have much to add apart that it’s one of the best natural view I’ve seen in my all life."
144,China's Bryce Canyon!,"We went there on 2nd and 3rd day of Golden week and we didn't have problems with crowds. The key for us was to leave Zhangjiajie early. On both days we took a bus around 6.15-6.30 and we dìdn't have to queue for anything more than 5 mins, except when leaving the area. We left from the eastern end of Golden whip stream, and there was a line of 25 mins. So be early and understand that there will be people - it is China. If you don't want people, go somewhere else.The route our hotel owner suggested was this:1st dayBailong elevator - hallelujah/ avatar area - bus to Tianzi - Tianzi area - walk down to tram bus stop - bus to wulingyuan.Here the best part of tour was Warrior taming horse scenic spot in Tianzi. We had 10-15 minutes for our 3 person group on 2nd day of golden week at 1pm! Easily one of the best views of the area and no tour groups at least for the 30 minutes we spent there. The highlight of our trip.2nd day.Zhangjiajie entrance - Huangshi cable car - Huangshi village - walk down to oxygen square - golden whip to water winding 4 gates - bus to wulingyuan. Here the golden whip was very crowded and easier than we thought. All the routes down seemed that long that and heavy that I would not spent my holiday going up those steep and small steps."
145,Great views but horrible crowds and noise ,"The nature here is truly spectacular and I do greatly recommend a visit (the score more reflects the park administration). However, the hiking in the area is very poorly managed. In fact, I think UNESCO should really take away the current status, until some reform takes place. See below for some advice.The most popular attractions have absurd amounts of people which makes them hard to enjoy, I therefore highly recommend some instead nearly completely empty hiking trails. These are however very poorly signposted and information is scarce. The quality of the trails is however of excellent quality, (well-laid stone trails, used when the park had single-digit million hikers, instead of the current 20 million tour tourists).The area has a spectacular network of now abandoned hiking trails, from when the mountains was visited without buses and cable cars. However, the park administration do everything to make sure no one uses these trails (including avoiding signage, hiding paths behind bathrooms, and grossly inflated distance markers, so much for mountain safety). These, often well laid out stone trails, are now left to neglect (in a quite charming way, and the solitude is very nice, and an absurd contrast to other parts of the park). Beyond the neglected stone paths, a set of normal hiking trails are left to decay at an even more rapid stage to the stage that I suspect that in some cases a machete is necessary. So-so maps are available within the park, but many (most) trails on these maps are not signposted or in any way maintained, and often actively hidden. I recommend an OSM map with altitude curves to get around the park, this map only includes the somewhat maintained trails (many of which still are not signposted). Pick up the two Chinese and English labelled park maps too, but keep in mind that these often are inaccurate, and that many displayed trails are closed and/or not signposted (if not actively hidden).I particularly recommend the trails connecting the Golden-whip stream area with the Yangjiajie area (the Shandou gap trails), that are not signposted but in good condition, spectacular nature, and offers complete solitude and the wonderful geologically themed trail between the Dagauntai 大觀台area and a bit before the Shentang Gulf (this trail is left to decay and includes some large caves, you can find it rather easily from the Shentang Gulf direction (no sign-posting), though in reverse I doubt anyone would find it). This trail is a particularly good example on how extremely poorly managed this UNESCO site is, and why UNESCO should force some action by the park administration. By all accounts, the east of the Golden-whip stream also has a very nice set of trails, but they are closed now for 2 years due to ""damages"" (without a doubt these damages are just an excuse to stop visitors from going there, I took a sneak-peak up one of the (closed) trails and they were of very high quality). Some of the older trails have wonderful university-level geology signage from the UNESCO days, that are now left in total decay. It is really a disgrace.Many of the green trails on the official maps, labelled jungle trails, are left in total decay (and absolutely no signage). Most are actively hidden by the park administration, and as a single hiker with no information (these are not available on the OSM map as trails), I was not comfortable taking some of these, and the few I saw (briefly walked) looked heavily overgrown (though probably hikeable). All seems to be actively hidden in the park. Given the quite extreme steepness of the area some caution is in order. Most have probably only had single-digit visitors in months (or years). A very modest amount of restoration and signage would no doubt make these very attractive hikes however.Of the more populated hiking paths, I recommend the hiking around Yangjiajie (though avoid the path just underneath the cable care), and Tianzi-shan which are particularly nice. The most popular central area is extremely overpopulated in high season, and can be missed (hike underneath instead in the Shandou-gap). A nice trail leads up from the Shandou-gap to this part of the mountain. The Huangshi mountain area can be skipped, though as everywhere the nature there is spectacular. The golden whip stream walk is very flat, but pleasant, if overcrowded. Don’t expect to much guidance from your local hotel/guesthouse, though you may be lucky. I was based in Yangjiajie, which was a good choice I think, though the main road here was at this time very poor. Soon a new highway will connect here, and some better maintenances/signage of the nearby trails may appear (as well as less solitude). The abundant busses and cable cars make creating a good itinerary very simple, no matter where you are based (in fact if these would coexist with a larger number of maintained trails, hiking in the area would be truly fantastic).It took my around 2½ full days to visit/hike all parts of the park (including some non-signposted trails). If more was opened up for hiking, this would greatly increase, and this would truly be a world-class hiking destination (with spectacular supporting infrastructure).  Very little work would be required for this to be true (and very minor expenditure, given the enormous turnover of the current park), and would basically just mean restoring the park to it's 1992/2004 status, plus cable cars. That UNESCO allows the current active dismantling of the park is a disgrace. As for the near future, a high-speed rail, and more highways are planned, and the current 300+ stalls on the top of the mountain are apparently not enough with even more under construction."
146,Just gorgeous,"This place is amazing . Admittedly I found it a bit confusing to get around , but overall it was fantastic to spend time in such a stunning location . I went at peak season... so it is hard to avoid crowds ... but I managed to break away from the main throngs . A couple of tips :1) take the cable car up to Tianzi mountain .. it is less crowded and easy to navigate. Once at Tianzi mountain you can see great scenery and then take a bus to Yangjiajie ... some good scenery again and you can take a cable car down to Yangjiajie village and then a bus to other sites further down .  Be sure to take a map with you. People are friendly and want to help ... having a map and a translation app helps ! Oh ... and bring cash for the cable cars."
147,Get There Early,"My first day I made an ambitious plan and hiked 16 kilometers, up and over and up again.  Most of the time I was the only one on the trail."
148,Amazing experience,Seeing these mountains in person was worth the 16+ hrs of flight time from the US. The mountains were so magical! Thanks Avatar for introducing these mountains to the world!
149,"there are buses inside  but need signage, confusing to go to another mountain","Highly recommended. One day is not enough to see all the different views and all of them are breathtaking. Please, be aware of the language barrier when asking for directions as the park is enormous and not always easy to get around. Give it at least to days to do Golden Whip, Huangzhou and Tianzi Mountain. Also, cloudy/rainy days are not the best as some of the mountains can get covered."
150,Wow. Just wow.,"It's such a beautiful place with magnificent rock formations. I wish to be there during foggy or cloudy day(because of better background for the pictures!). Unfortunately the sky was crystal clear and it was very hot(in mid-April). Anyway I've loved this park, the skywalks and other nice parts of this region.I strongly recommend this park. It's must see place.RomanP"
151,We found a marvellous spot with no crowds ,"We saw it on a day after a rainy day. The mists and low clouds makes the whole scenery in front of your eyes surreal. The computer generated images from the movie Avatar took the scenery here as their starting point for further wild improbably fantastic imaginary projections.Understand that the now put a cap on the number of visitors allowed into the park daily. We were able to enjoy the place with not too much distraction.  When will they adopt the silent wireless tour talk systems now used world wide, and ban the tinny raucous loud speakers blaring the incessant chatter of individual tour guides and ruin the atmosphere?"
152,Amazing,"This place was cool, but it was SUPER crowded and VERY hard to get around if you do not read or speak Chinese.  The people in the park were rude and VERY pushy... I was literally pushed and elbowed many times.  The walkways are small and you have hundreds of people trying to walk on them and take photos.  I have been all over china and this was the worst!  While the park is HUGE and is SO cool, I would suggest getting a guide who can help you get around.  Be very careful that you also get on the correct shuttles..... We got on one and asked the driver if it would take us to the cable cars to go to the front gate and showed him a map... he said YES and pointed to the cable cars.  then he drove to a completely different location.  The park closed and we missed the last cable car.  We had to BEG the men working to let us on... after many comical attempts, they finally opened back up and let us ride down....  we were then walked out fo the building they they slammed the door and would not help us figure out the way to the main gate (you have to have a shuttle and they already stopped too).  Luckily we found someone with a car who we paid to take us!  It was not the best experience and all of this could have been avoided if we got a guide...lesson learned."
153,Huge Place,Everything was perfect it was like living in Avatar movie. Natural beauty much better then any city. One must spend 4-5 days here if ur nature lover.I didn't have enough of it though
154,Must see while in China,"A must visit! Best base is to stay near Wulingyuang. Bring water and food, because inside only have fast food and expensive.Be prepared for the hords of Chinese tourists."
155,Amazing place ,"There's a very good reason was why Zhangjiajie was the first to be declared a ""National Park"" by the Chinese Government and is on the UNESCO heritage list: its rock formations are amazing, are unique and look like something from another planet (part of the ""Avatar"" movie was filmed here). It is huge, you need minimum two days to get a better feeling of the place and yes, it is crowded, mostly with locals. Nevertheless, it is an amazing and unique park, not to be missed."
156,Natural wonders ,"We bought the pass that allows you to enter the park for four days (around 220yuan). There are three main big areas that you can explore. We went to two: the hallelujah mountains one day, and Tianzi mountain other day. Both trips  took us the whole day of hiking up and down. There's lots of stairs on the way but you can of course take the bus to the elevator and skip most of them. Elevators and cable cars are the most popular amongst Chinese tourists so expect long queues. Bring some extra cash with you (in case it's getting dark and you actually need to get faster down and use the elevator or call me car). You should start going down around 4pm."
157,Wonderful park,"Unlike the Hollywood blockbuster the national park was a breathtaking spectacle well worth seeing. The sandstone monoliths have more character than any of the acting performances seen in Avatar and the local monkeys provide more nuanced dialogue. If you see one film this year, pick anything other than Avatar. If you visit one national park, make it this one."
158,One day for top attractions,Absolutely fantastic place you must see once in your life. Amazing landscape. You feel yourself inside movie Avatar.
159,Let down by ignorant domestic tourists,"This place could be wonderful. However, as in most of mainland China, the grab for the almighty dollar outweighs any other consideration. In light of this, please heed my predictions and comments (based on years of travel to China for both business and leisure).1. A ""family friendly"" resort offering all manner of themed clothing, stuffed toys and postcards will be built without regard for conservation or the environment.2. No attempt will be made to secure the fragile ecosystem and people are free to climb on the rock formations, graffiti the signage and litter at will.3. No sense of courtesy is observed by anyone, including the ticket sellers / bus drivers. Prepare yourself for being pushed aside, ignored and elbowed if you can't speak the language.It's such a shame that the average Chinese have this innate sense that they must ""tick the box"" by visiting all the wonders China has to offer. However, I found most of them (those who could speak a little English) to be ignorant (no idea what they were looking at) and actually uninterested. They just wanted to be able to say that they had been there. I had a fight with a woman who had taken 2 seats (including the window seat) on our boat cruise so she could sleep, while I was trying to take photos - unbelievable!"
160,Epic view of my life,The views are spectacular The area was the inspiration for the movie Avatar. Beware there are a lot of tourists but still worth visiting you could spend a couple of days lots of hiking trails.
161,Stunning Rock Formation,"So the nature in this park are undoubtably magnificent. Though it’s very much exploited, which is a bit frustrating. The entrance fee of the park is pretty high but does not include all busses in the park, nor the cable cars or the famous elevator. All of these come with additional cost. The routes through the park are pretty much designed to need some of these extra facilities. Then the park is pretty much focused on Chinese and Korean tourists who travel in groups. As an individual without knowledge of chinese, getting around in the park might be a bit challenging. All doable nonetheless."
162,Spectacular Zhangjiajie,This kind of rock formation can only be seen here.We thoroughly enjoyed it.The route we followed-Entry-Bailong Elevator-Avator rock-Natural bridge-Tianzi Mountain-Coming down with cable car
163,Rock Formations,"This landscape is stunning.  It's worth taking a guide to avoid the queues, even in the winter.Don't buy any souvenirs here unadvised though.  What they sell as wood is veneer filled with clay.  If you guide prevaricates when trying to translate the name of the wood, chances are it's because it's not wood."
164,"Hiking advice for the area, for an attraction where hiking is badly mismanaged by the park administration","One of the coolest hiking experiences of my life was getting to see the jagged and magical rock formations at Zhangjiajie. These mountains have tons of ancient history, is a popular destination for free climbers and were the inspiration for the world of Avatar. Opportunities to see the whole mountains from a summit point was really special and you get a good peek of the persistent fog that rests on the mountains. Don’t worry, for those who don’t love to hike, the Chinese parks typically provide shortcuts to get to the top. There’s also an elevator!"
165,"Scenery is OK, but not worth the hassle","I was excited for this trip with my mom (age mid 60s), and it did not disappoint us despite our mistake in taking the wrong trail. My biggest regret is that we took a wrong path, and ended up descending the mountain after taking the elevator up. Please give this park more than 1 day, a park pass is valid for 4 days so make the most of it!"
166,Leisure,"The scenery is breath taking, surreal, and unlike anything else! It is worth a special journey here just for the scenery.We had a tour guide who is helpful. But, if you speak Chinese, you should be able to visit the place by yourself. The national park did a good job to facilitate the visitors. Scenic points are well marked and paths are well built. Thoroughly enjoy the three days in this park and surrounding area ( Wulingyuan and Grand Canyon),"
167,Surreal ,"The museums, golden whip stream, hallelujah mountains, bailong elevator, cable car etc was really nice. We enjoyed going through each and every place. It was tiring and a busy tourist season. The entrance ticket did not include any of the attractions and had to be separately bought which added up to quite a bit and expensive."
168,A crowded place from a different world,one of the most beautiful national parks in the world. coming in winter time has many advantages like avoiding long lines.
169,Zhangjiajie offers fantastic mountain scenaries. AVATAR filmed here,"very beautiful scenic with stunning world longest cable car.it was my first time to step 999 stairs to reach "" Heaven door "" Tianmen cave. Then continue to walk along the sheer cliff and it was my best experience in my life."
170,Excellent place to visit ,Get your home work done before you visit this place. People say you need atleast 4 days to cover the entire place. I visited the Hallelujah mountain (avatar mountain) in 3 hours. Nice place but I felt this place is a bit expensive.
171,a must visit,"ZJJ national forest park was the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. I just got back from an incredible five-day trip, and the entire time I could barely comprehend how gorgeous everything was. Before going I browsed the forums for a private tour guide for Mandarin speakers (to save $$) but I didn't want a traditional chinese tour experience. I couldn't find anything. So, once in ZJJ I asked around a few places and found the perfect guy. I HIGHLY recommend Panda Xiong (熊大). First of all, he is f-ing hilarious. My family and I couldn't stop laughing. He is a born and bred TuJia local, and knew all of the hidden spots with spectacular views without the crowds. He also has his own car, so it was really easy to go around to different spots and we were able to be flexible.On our last day, he even picked us up from our hotel to take us to his favourite breakfast spot (free of charge) because he noticed how much we loved Hunan breakfast noodles. Because he doesn't speak much English, his prices are lower than English-speaking tour guides.  If your Mandarin is decent and you're looking for a great tour guide with transportation, then Panda is your guy! I don't think I can leave his number on this post, but you can search 熊大 and find him, or PM me for his contact."
172,astonishing place,Zhangjiajie is a bit too commercialised.......the natural scenery is without a doubt beautiful but I felt that with too many tourists the whole atmosphere is disappointing.
173,Wow ,"Private tour Bruce TianWe used Bruce Tian for a three-day private tour and were very happy that we did.Bruce is a really friendly guy with a good command of English.  As a local himself, he is very knowledgeable about the area, and is more than happy to share information about the local culture and give insights into what everyday life is like for people China.On the first day of our tour we visited the Zhangjiajie National Park.  The area was covered in cloud and we were a little worried that our trip might be a disappointing one - but Bruce used his experience on the mountain to move us around the huge park to area where he knew it would be clearer, returning to some areas later in the day when the mist had lifted. As a result we had a great experience in this amazing park.Bruce is a really safe driver and owns a nice mid size luxury SUV.  We used his set three day plan to visit the Park, Boefang Lake, The Glass Bridge and Tianmen Mountain.  We also added on a visit to the Dragon Cave which was really worth it.   If you are an independent traveller you could easily do Boefang Lake and the Glass Bridge by yourself, but you need a guide for the National Park and Tianmen Mountain as you would waste too much time trying to work out where to go.  While there are signs in English – they aren’t that helpful in helping you to navigate such large areas.Bruce recommended we stay 2 nights in the Pullman then move into the city of Zhangjiajie so that we could go to the Fairy Fox show.  Unfortunately, we had already booked the Pullman for three nights so went to the cultural show next to the Pullman instead.  This show was just okay – we should have taken Bruce’s advice."
174,Amazing Tianmen Shan,"Just stunning! The views are insane and the park is very well organized, beware of the monkeys though, pack your stuff within your back-pack not on the outside!"
175,Pretty but my god the people.,"It rained while we were there, so it was hit or miss scenery, but with cloud it added mystery to it."
176,Awesome experience - but oh my the people,"Amazing site to visit! There are shuttle buses, cable cars, a tram and an elevator to help get you from place to place.Be prepared to hike and walk up and down lots of steps! So much too see, you’ll need more than 1 day! Take your time and soak it up!"
177,"Spectacular scenery, just need to escape the groups",My wife and I spent a day visiting the National Forest. What a buzz. Exceptional views. Fantastic. Great amenities. Excellent for photography. A trip of a life time.
178,Zhangijajie Tour with Bruce Tian,"There are spectacular views every place you look.  It’s a complicated day - much easier with a good guide.  There are multiple trams, a large outdoor elevator, a cable car, and photo ops everywhere,Bring lots of water, good climbing shoes.and expect large crowds in some locations from tour groups.  If you walk away from the groups onto some paths!you will get better pictures."
179,Zhangjiajie national parks,"It took us about 7-8 hours to see this National Park, and it was worth it. We haven't seen anything like it. The view was unique and quite impressive. We hired a tour guide (a Chinese who can speak English), and it was good that we hired him. We were able to see the highlights.  The Park was very crowded with many tourists.."
180,Majestic,Wonderful  park to visit.Try to allow at least 2 days to see it in all types of weather. it is very well organised with buses to take you around but is a little confusing so I would recommend a guide to get the most out of your visit.
181,Amazing Park,"We spent 3 days exploring Zhanjiajie, and what an amazing location!!! From the high peaks and lookouts, to the low valleys and rivers, there's so much to see and walk and climb. Be prepared for a LOT of steps, they like their stairs here! It's 245yuan for a park entrance ticket which is good for 4 days (There are longer options available if needed). We felt 3 days covered most of the grounds. We stayed at Pipaxi Hotel which is only 10min away from the main park entrance. There is a 10yuan shuttle from from the main entrance to Wulingyuan entrance, ask around where the shuttle is. There's also a free bus service inside the park to take you around the place.Take plenty of water as there's lots of walking to do. There's a variety of food outlets throughout the park, from McDonald's and KFC to snack shacks and restaurants. Becareful of monkeys on some of the trails who may get aggressive and snatch food out of your hands. All the maps you get in the park don't seem to match, so it gets a bit confusing at times locating a particular track. If in doubt, ask a local.We would definitely come back again and explore more of this wonderful park!!"
182,Amazing views,"We are mandarin-speaking teens that managed to clear the attractions in 2 days. If you cannot speak mandarin, please for the love of god get a local guide. Each route is different, some that are hard on the knees, some hard on the back, having a local guide will allow you to optimise your routes to have the best experience possible. Plan your route with the guide at least a day in advance, and ask for preparation tips. I would highly suggest to pack as light as possible. Skip the Adidas bottle for 3 yuan plastic ones, ditch the umbrella for plastic ponchos, bring the lightest power bank you have in your arsenal and do everything in your power to drop the grams. There are many local food stores, refreshment booths and toilet along the way, so you can be rest assured you wouldn’t be eating grass and defecating down the mountains."
183,Teenage Adventures,Got a taxi from the hotel (25CNY) to Central Bus Station then took #1 bus (14CNY) to National Park. Only had a short time here as I was late starting the day but may have been a blessing as the crowds were small and no queue for the elevator. Worthwhile visiting if you are pushed for time as you don't need to hike if you don't want to (free shuttles) although there are lots of extra costs along the way. Enjoyable none the less.
184,Clearing all doubts Zhangjiajie National Park,"Once again you are in China the tour buses are endless, therefore the earlier you get here the better! But dont let the people get you down, this place is amazing and should 100% be on your list. I read so many of these reviews before i left because it isnt easy to navigate china if you dont speak the lang, therefore this is what we found... You buy the ticket, it is  a 4 day ticket so you can go back, i dont think you need more than 2 days, but it is up to you.  There are 4 entrances, the main one is wulingyuan, dont bother... thing is there is a little town here and so many hotels etc (food is nice here tho and they speak more english here than they do in the actual town of Zhangjiajie - So you might want to stay here) But we found that the entrance at - zhangjiajie national forest park (you can find it on google is closer to the many city and is NO WAY as busy.. You can take camera etc into the park no problem and there are half decent toliets (you might wanna use the disabled ones) and shops if you need food, take cash if you dont have wechat pay. The park is connect via a number of different bus routes and has a start and a finish, first thing to do is pick up a map and get them to explain the route. You can either go straight for the bus on the left or go right and walk across the river between the mountains... i highly recommend the walk, it was so nice and there was no one doing it at 8, we saw the first group of people at 10, 2 hours later. The lift up to the avatar mountain view really isnt that bad, the horror stories for 3 hours queues weren't there, we go up in like 20 mins at 12pm. highly recommend the cable car down or up, if the weather is clear it is amazing, we took it down but defo do it. Enjoy"
185,Good but ,"First of all, the scenery here is breahtaking - sandstone pinnacles billions of years old, lush forests make this a spot you'd not likely associate with China. The RMB245 is valid for a 4-day visit but to be honest after two days, it was a little same-old, same-old. There is a lot of walking to be done, even if you spring for the cable car and elevator rides up the mountains, there are still steps to navigate which during the busy season can be a little dangerous given the crowds. It is best to be prepared with the right kind of shoes, walking pole and lots of water. There is also a lot of jostling, and queue-cutting at the scenic lookout points that makes the visit a little dangerous. Most visitors head to Yianzi Mountain and the Avatar place, and these spots are packed with tourists. I would instead recommend Yangjiajie over on the western end of the park, it has far less visitors and immensely scenic."
186,One of the best places on earth,This national forest park is huge with many sections and attractions to visit.  The landscape is absolutely beautiful and changes according to the weather and seasons.  It is simply a must see.  Hope it is well environmentally protected for the future.
187,Zhangjiajie infoggy times,"Having seen my fair share of natural wonders all over the world, I’m probably someone who is not that easy to impress. However, the Zhangjiajie National Forest Park simply left me speechless. It is truly a place unlike any other in the world. Thousands of quartz-sandstone pillars rise hundreds of meters in the sky and provide visitors with a breathtaking view. Due to local weather conditions the pillars are often shrouded in some mist. If the mist is not too dense, it often even adds to the atmosphere in my opinion. Furthermore, it is rare that it is foggy the entire day. Usually the mists go away after 2 or 3 hours. Getting around the park is fairly easy with frequent buses running between many stops. However, information about the bus routes in English is not always available. In my experience it is best to approach younger people who look like they can speak English at the bus stations and ask for the right directions. Getting to the viewing points at the upper plateau can be done in three different ways: 1.	By climbing. Please be aware that we are talking hundreds of meters of height elevation and thousands of steps here, so you definitely should have a reasonable level of fitness2.	Bailong Elevator. The world’s tallest outdoor elevator takes you to the top in less than 2 minutes. However, be prepared for some waiting time unless you show up very early in the morning3.	By cable car. Probably my favorite way to go the mountain seeing as you have some incredible views along the wayThe only truly negative point about Zhangjiajie National Forest Park are the crowds of local tourists who often display an abysmal behaviour (even by Chinese standards). People are constantly pushing and shoving in any queues and I’ve even seen two old Chinese grannies having a fight. Furthermore Chinese tour guides seem to love megaphones, which spoils any chance of a quiet visit for everyone else. For this reason I always bring ear plugs along with me on my Chinese travels.But overall, Zhangjiajie National Forest Park should definitely be on your list of must-visit destinations if you are in this part of China."
188,One day tour of Zhangjiajie Forest & Glass Bridge,"Visited park by ourselves (guide i wanted to hire wasn't available). Of course we got lost and confused couple times, but people there are incredibly friendly and happy to point you in right direction.Map was kindly provided by our hotel. We started at Wulinyuan entrance and explored Tianzi mountain area first, after that we got on the bus and drove to Yuanjiajie zone. After that we walked downstairs to Golden Whip Stream. We bought lunch from one of the street food sellers, was delicious. Can't say it was crazy packed, but we encountered huge groups of Chinese tourists from time to time. We didnt buy tickets in advance, was easy and fast to get it right there. Price 245kuai.Zhangjiajie park is most amazing! certainly worth visiting!"
189,Stunning geo-park and fantastic walks,"We would say that Zhangjiajie National Forest Park is one of the best forest parks in the world. We were deeply shocked when we saw the famous Avatar Mountain in the park. Put this place on your list if you're very impressed by James Cameron's movie ""Avatar""."
190,"Stunning, but tough","We had an amazing tour of the acclaimed ZJJ National Forest Park, home to the famous Avatar Floating Mountains. The experience was surreal, this is the real Grand Canyon of Asia. There is so much to see. What you need is comfortable shoes, backpack, water and an umbrella/raincoat incase its raining. Get there early to avoid crazy queues and DEFINITELY avoid visiting during local holiday season. You'll regret it.The glass elevator was a bit of a let down, the ride ends before you know it. Walking along the Golden Whip Stream was memorable since you get to see the clear water flowing down, tree bathing and you'll surely see a lot of wild monkeys. Avoid carrying anything shiny (avoid showing any food, and chips/crisp/biscuit packets). We bought the 4 day ticket, so we saw the entire mountain area over 2 days.... did not fancy killing ourselves and preferred a rather relaxed approach to sight seeing. There are a ton of places to take photos... would be nice to carry a D/SLR if you fancy taking nice pics.... else Smartphone works just as good. There is a lot of walking, so be prepared to walk atleast 10-12kms.... its not that difficult since there are buses (this is the SAFEST way to see the forest). You CAN'T have your own private car chauffeur you around and avoid the private taxi (of the locals, who live in the mountain) as they drive dangerously. You'll have to queue to get into buses, but don't worry there will be plenty (incase you miss to get on one). I reckon park closes at 6PM or so. Enjoy the experience and remember to wear the local traditional Chinese Ethnic Miniority outfits to take pics... you'll know what I mean when you get there. Safe Travels !"
191,"Zhangjiajie Park--Great Site, Difficult to Enjoy","We came here in 2012 and didn't see a thing due to bad weather. We promised ourselves that we shall be back some day. Our second chance came this past November as we joined a tour to this part of China again. Fortunately, weather was much better than our last visit, at least we were able to see what was around us, and it was not raining. It was absolutely beautiful, more developed and less crowded than the last time. Unfortunately, the tour group that we were on didn't do their job right. They have cheated out of our time, instead of seeing more sights and spending time in the forest, we wasted many hours at mandatory shopping stops. Word of advice, join a reputable tour for the worth of your time. I doubt that we will be back for another visit. Fortunately, we have been here twice and got our share of this beautiful park!"
192,"Lovely Views, Frustrating to Get Around","Incredible, beautiful place. Climb the 6,000 steps - view the pagodas atop the karst peaks. Sometimes shrouded in mist with tigers in the forests. The most stunning place I have ever seen with grateful thanks to my Chinese hosts for taking me there."
193,5days with Venus in ZJJ.,"This a very unique part of the world, Avatar fans will enjoy. Get a good guide such as Candy from China highlights and you skip some of the long queues. Take your camera as there is some stunning views."
194,Spectacular Views,One of the best spots in China. It can get a bit crowded so it's better to start super early! I recommend downloading some kind of translation app given that few people speak English in the surroundings.
195,Awesome experience but avoid crowds,"One of the most beautiful and popular place of Zhangjiajie. We went there with very high expectations and didnt let us down. You take elevator from entrance,  walk around park , take bus explore Tianzi mountain and go down by cable car with enjoying beautiful views. Avataat mountain and walk is so beautiful but loved the most was Tianzi mountain. So peaceful and picturesque place."
196,Don’t stick to the orange routes...,Famous mountains of eroded sandstone similar to Bryce Canyon in Utah but with green vegetation. Offers great walking trails with many photographic offerings. A must see area inside China
197,A must!,Stunning scenery.  Mist only added to the beauty and mystery of the place.  Our guide Lucky was excellent and made sure we were kept informed and comfortable at all times.
198,Huge Park,"I recommend a minimum of three days in Zhangjiajie 张家界 as there are several areas that will take a full day to experience properly. The famous glass bridge is here but you might find that the other scenic routes and views outshine its marvel. All the areas will require tickets (student discounts available for the young full-time students) but considering the experience it is well worth every penny. Simply spectacular. The hiking is not very rough and wilderness like as the area is built to endure mass tourism (tens of millions yearly) There are several areas, for example Wulingyuan Scenic Area (Zhangjiajie National Park, Tianzi Mountain Nature Reserve, Suoxi Valley), Yellow Dragon Cave, Dragon Emperor Cave, Baofeng Lake, Tianmen Mountain Nature Reserve, Golden Whip Stream, Yuanjiajie Nature Reserve, etc...   There should be over 1000 hotels serving the area and the prices were incredibly low 2017 when I went there with a group of students. If you get a chance to go there ... don't hesitate. The hotels and hostels can help you arrange the daily tickets and trips, it is hard to get the planning and ticket purchases right without someone who speaks Mandarin."
199,"Breath taking, Simply awesome.",Visited the Zhanjiajie national park in June 2019;after reading the reviews and how the famous Avatar movie scenery was created from these areas.Thought I must go and witness  this for myself and wow.......this place is huge and you need to get a 3days pass to enter the park.Plenty of walking and tired muscles but the sights and scenery are amazingly beautiful. So glad I have this opportunity to visit one of the world nature parks.Must visit once in this lifetime!!!!
200,One of the best forest park,"The National Park was breath taking and Chris, our guide, helped us see the park and all its glory while minimizing the large tour guides that exist within any park. Chris explained and showed us the magnificent sandstone pillars that  resembled people or animals. This park is a must if you are traveling to Zhangjaejie.  Chris also took us to authentic Hunan cuisine, drove us to the glass bridge in the grand canyon and provided photographic help when taking family pictures.  The lake was my least favorite part of the trip but it did provide scenic views from the boat. and gave us time off our feet which was much needed. What an amazing experience for my family and me. Chris, you became part of our family on this trip.  Thank you for everything. You made this trip memorable to all of us. Yyour importance is measured by the experience we all had both individually and collectively.  Your knowledge of what we were experiencing was critical.  The pictures capture this! And finally, thank you for bringing the tastes of Hunan to our lips by selecting the restaurants we ate in.  Bravo to Viator and specifically to Chris."
201,Great looking mountains,"We spent two days in the Park and visited the highlights including Yuanjiajie, Tianzi Mountain, and Gold stream. The Avartar Mountain is amazing. The ticket was valid for 4 days. You can see more places like yangjiajie, good for hiking lover.Zhangjiajie  National Forest Park is very huge and requires a lot of walk. The Bailong Elevator and cable car can save your time and strength. The end of Oct was a good time to visit it, beautiful scenery and less crowded."
202,Zhangjiajie a long awaited visit,"Together with friends, we spent few days in Zhangjiajie area. You should know that the park is about 2 hours away from the city center and since you have to take a bus you might come too late to the park and spend an additional hour waiting in the line and then extra time to wait for the shuttle buses that take you to the park area. We have decided to stay in Wulinyuan district, which is just outside of the park's gate. You can take a bus the day before your visit (the last one goes at 4 pm. and cost only 17 Yuan.) And enter the park the next morning before the rush hour starts. We stayed at Holaiwu Inn, which was the best accommodation, where the host even privately drove us to the top of the mountain and guided us the whole day! (no charge, just his kindness) really recommend!"
203,Zhangjiajie - 张家界 (Avatar was filmed here) is simply amazing,A great place to visit for the whole family. There can be a lot of walking but enough cable cars to lighten the load. December is not busy at all with NO queues anywhere. Take the cable car from the middle of town from around 250 rmb pp and enjoy the walk around the mountains. Not a heavy walk but lasts 2/3 hours depending on how many photos you stop to take. Glass walkways cost a little extra but only 20 rmb. Escalators closed throughout the winter though.
204,So much to see in a short time,"Stunning, beautiful and completely spectacular scenery!very accessible with buses bring you round to see the different aspects of the park.its highly worth a visit"
205,JEBSEN HOLIDAY Group Tour,"It was beautiful what you could see. Iy was snowing the day we went, a lot of ice. Take some kind of ice shoes in the winter."
206,Well worth the effort,"You really don't need to pay a guide to assist you.  Most guides are lazy and they will not bring you to all the places.  They just want to get their job done quickly and collect their pay.I spent the 1st 4 days with a guide and the next 7 days on my own.  Everyone knows, the 7 days was simply the best!You pay less, you get the best out of the trip"
207,5 stars all round,"I have been for 5 days for Changsha and it seem so short. On my second day, i went to Zhagjiajie National Forest and we decided walking up to the mountain instead of taking a cable car. It took long time to reach the top and i was scratched by naughty monkeys. Yet, the monkeys have vaccination already.It is worth to walk up and get lost there. We started walking from 11 am and reached the top around 3.30 pm. Then we took a cable car down to the exit. Anyway, we couldnt finish along our plan coz run out of time....a bit dissapointed. I MISS MANY TOURIST ATTRACTIONS coz i had to go to Fenghuang on next day."
208,U cant find better place ,"The park is spectacular and well laid out and maintained.  The mountains are really unique and breathtakingly beautiful. I would highly recommend visiting!They had shuttle buses to take you up and down the mountain and very well marked and maintained trails. (Just be prepared for a lot of stairs!) They had clean rest areas (bring your own TP and be prepared for the squatty potties) and lots of places to throw out garbage. They had many vendors selling snacks, drinks and souvenirs."
209,"""Must see"" place",The park is huge and there are a lot of walking so comfortable shoes are recommended. March is off peak season but still full of tourists. Spend at least two full days in order to see all attractions and enjoy the nature. Unfortunately we didn’t get to see some scenes due to the foggy weather. The mountains are just incredibly beautiful. It is one of the Must See places in China.
210,Day tour of Zhangjiajie,Great place - just recommend you get a local guide near to the ticket office - make sure the shop know him to verify he is local but well worth it
211,Amazing views!!,"With only one day to visit Zhangjiajie National Forest, Eric Denny made the impossible happen. In 6 hours, we covered the major highlights of the forest: Avatar mountain, Tianzi Mountain and Golden Whip Spring Canyon, the cable car and Bailong elevator. Eric, who is from Zhangjiajie, made our trek effortless, enjoyable and saved us needed time. In the afternoon, we walked the glass bridge over the canyon. Eric, also a foodie, arranged local fine dining for lunch & dinner and a visit to a sandstone gallery. Long or short visits to Zhangjiajie, Eric knows the history and culture of the area and will treat you with stories while guiding you through the park."
212,Truly amazing,"Recently, a group of us went on a 8 days’ trip to Zhangjiajie. Before going, my only knowledge of Zhangjiajie was that it was the place where Avatar was filmed. In 8 enjoyable and memorable days, we saw and learnt much:1) Marvellous natural creations - Tianmen Mountain, Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, Yellow Dragon Cave, Huang Shi village, etc.2) The tremendous advances made by China - the longest cable car ride, longest escalator ride, the Glass Bridge built over China’s Grand Canyon and outstanding Sound and Light show choreographed by the famous film director Ang Lee.3)At the Hunan Provincial Museum, we saw the very well preserved 2,200 years’ old body of Lady of Dai, wife of the Marquis of Dai from the Western Han Dynasty. Just how this incredible level of preservation was achieved has amazed scientists around the world. We learnt about the lifestyle of these ancient Chinese, the food they ate, their medical practices, military and exercise techniques, their superior skills in weaving silk, etc.The trip was very well arranged by our English-speaking Chinese guide Gabriel and his team. When the mountainous terrain was difficult for the less mobile, they were always around to help. They entertained us with modern songs as well as songs of the Tujia minority group. We stayed in excellent hotels in the Sheraton and Crowne Plaza chains. During the trip, he even pointed to us which toilets are cleaner. Gabriel also ensured that we had delicious Chinese food, with specification to the chefs for less spicy and salty food. Most important of all, Gabriel and his team are honest and kind.We are so satisfied with the services of Gabriel that we are engaging him again for our next trip to Kunming, Lijiang and Shangrila."
213,What a place,"This is one of the natural wonders of the world--seemingly hundreds of mist-enshrouded quartzite karsts and mountains with cliff walks, multiple short to long trails, lakes, and so on.  If you get a chance, by all means go--and spend at least 3-4 days."
214,Unusual Sandstone Landscape Unique Place,"We added this location to our itinerary specifically for this park. However, it was expensive to enter and expensive to experience the other attractions. The signage is not very good, and although the buses are available, knowing where to pick them up using the hop on/off method was not easy. They seem to operate on a loop that go in one direction in some places, and go both ways in other areas. They seemed to stop at random locations generally near attractions. Maps around the park were not clear to read. As a result, we only ended up doing two short walks and riding the glass elevator. I would recommend that if coming from Wulingyuan you 1st stop at the cable cars, then take every other opportunity as it comes around. Doubling back (like we did - doing the elevator first, expecting to return to other areas after this) was too difficult and confusing."
215,Spectacular,"We had a very relaxed day in the park to view the Avatar mountains and do the cable car. If you would like to hike or see other parts of the park, you may need additional days. The signage is not too bad once on the trails, but not that easy at bus stations.The mountains are really beautiful. It's a shame Chinese tourists put their rubbish everywhere despite of the bins every few meters. They even feed the wild monkeys by giving them biscuits in plastic packaging. I think the authorities should do more to prevent this.Expensive entrance fee and attractions inside the park but definitely worth it"
216,A Must See if you are in China,"We planned to hike the park for couple of days but we liked so much than we stayed almost a week, we stayed by the Forest park entrance, which was empty all the time, note that is not much going on around the villages so if you want noice and movement, you should stay closer to the towns, ticket is valid for four days and internal buses are for free, you need to pay for cable cars and trains, if you are student bring your student card and everything will be half price."
217,spectacular landscape,It’s the most breathtaking place you’ll ever see! Nature at its absolute best. “Oh WOW!” That’s all we could say at every corner every step of the way and every view point! Mesmerizing! Could have spent the day and it still wouldn’t have been enough to take in the beauty of this place!
218,Great forest ,"I recommend you to stay in Wulingyuan village, as it is walking distance into the national park, around 15 mins. If you stay in ZJJ, you will have to take a bus to visit the park everyday. Below are my 2cents worth and the trail we took. hope it will benefit some of you guys here! Few points to take note: - ticket is 248Yuan per pax and it is not transferable. they take your fingerprint and register with your card. valid for 4 days. - shuttle buses that is on the ground level don't go up to the mountains, and likewise, the shuttle buses ferrying you on top of the mountains don't go down to the mountains. most of the buses are ferrying you point to point. So, it means, you will have to change buses at certain spots to go to where you want. - definitely bring some food and fruits with you..Day 1: (highlighted in Orange)we decided to take the Golden Whip Stream (金鞭溪). it is 7.5km board walk trail which will take you through rivers streams, fauna, and admiring the mountains FROM BELOW; you will raise your neck and look UP to the mountains. you will see monkeys and please don't feed them. they get aggressive. if you are thinking 7.5km will take you only 2 hours to finish, and what do you do for the rest of the day? fear not. the transportation itself will take you 10-15 mins one way, stopping by for lunch, stopping to admire, being lost. The park is huge huge huge. Once you tapped your card, you will see lots of visitors. Walk a little more and be prepared to see lots of shuttle buses and not knowing where they go as, the signs are in mandarin. TO GET TO GOLDEN WHIP STREAM, take the bus that goes to (水绕四门). This bus will make 1 stop at the Ten Mile gallery. DO NOT GET OFF. STAY ON THE BUS, and hop off the next one. then you can start walking the trail. at the end of the trail, it will take another 15-20 mins to walk to ZJJ entrance. THE TRICKY PART STARTS HERE. you will not see any buses... so you will have to continue walking. as you walk, KEEP A KEEN LOOKOUT on your left, a red sign with chinese words, with 2 pricings 10yuan and 12 yuan. it will not be very obvious, so you really need to pay attention. walk in, there will be buses going back to Wulingyuan OR ZJJ. this is the best way to go back home. Day 2: highlighted in yellow - Recommened to take the cable car. our main purpose for the day was to see Tian Zi mountains, and the Avatar mountains. so we took the yellow path. take a shuttle bus to the cable car. cable car will bring you to the top of TIAN ZI MOUNTAINS. the ride is MAGNIFICENT. it will ride through the stones, beautiful and suddenly, you feel like you are so small amongst. once you reached the top, it will also be a shuttle bus ride down to avatar mountains.. once you reached the avatar mountains, you probably will be hungry.. THERE IS A RESTAURANT catering to chinese tourists, but foreigners are welcomed. it is 30Yuan per pax, and its really chinese food. do keep in mind you do have to shove and compete with the chinese tourists.. yes the rumors are true.. it is pretty scary. you will walk around the trails near avatar mountains - it is more like a loop, so which ever direction you choose, you will end up at the same destination - the BACK GARDEN.  Back Garden trail will descend you to the bottom of the mountains, but it will take 2-3 hrs depending on your speed. it was nearing 4pm when we arrived, so we took the Bailong Elevator. this is a little disappointing.. it literally is like a shopping centre elevator.. lol. within 30seconds all is over. AFTER the elevator, you will Q to take a bus again.. if its evening time, BEWARE, you will have to queeue like 30 mins.. this bus should take you straight to Wulingyuan entrance.. hope all these helps the future travelers!"
219,Breathtaking ,"I strongly recommend getting a guide for the day.  There is a lot to see and the free buses take you everywhere, but you need to know were to go.  Especially if you only have one day to visit.  Amazing views, watch out for the monkeys."
220,"Great Place to visit, but we had only a day to go around.",Such beautiful views!! Lots of walking to do but this National Park is gorgeous!! You definitely need to spend more than 1 day here....
221,Scenery is beautiful,"There’s no denying the unique geological attraction of this National Park.   The karst formations are unique and superb.   Even the fauna can be an surprising delight, and I don’t mean the habituated monkeys seeking food hand outs.   We spotted what appeared to be a multi banded krait hunting in a stream for fishes early one morning—personally I would avoid wading in the streams.   But spread that map out in front of you and one aspect becomes very apparent, this National Park lacks anything approaching a wilderness experience.  There simply aren’t enough hiking trails and more often than not visitors are expected to take buses.   The network of hiking trails is meager and where there could be a hiking alternative, frequently one must employ the bus service.   Which really is a shame, what few trails exist are both strenuous and provide unique vistas.    One is left with the distinct impression the bus network is designed to maximize the revenues of the gondolas, elevators and trams.   In fact at one point where a walking trail is actually in direct completion with a charged tram service the width of the tram line is about four time the width of the walking trail.  Also the trails signs, when they exist, simply point out the destination(s) without any indication of the destination’s distance or duration."
222,Still a Work in Progress,The place has beautiful views to offer and out of the world locations but for that you need to be careful in checking which days/ months are you travelling. For us it had been a very average experience since we had half of our day when we could barely see anything but clouds/fog. Within the first half of the day we could manage to see a few structures to get a feel of the place but rest of the day went in just changing buses but not being able to see anything.It a a very well managed place where in all you got walk approx 7 KM’s from elevator to cable car or vis verse and need to take multiple buses. But you need to face tourists which will be 98 percent Chinese and all in big groups with mic and speakers and it really gets irritating in some serene locations where you need peace.Everywhere you need to fight your way through large no of tourists to make it to places.In all it should be a good experience if you don’t visit during the time of rains and fog.
223,Fantastic.  A must see.  Go in May,"This is a rare mountain range. In the Chinese culture,  the mountain range is continuous,  yet at this forest Park,  you can see the beauty,  the transformation over the 5000 million years with each unique sandstone formation. Each has its individuality, colourful and character. As the clouds forms a ocean of white waves, caressing the range that seems to smile in the Sun."
224,Must see in Zhangjiajie!,"The scenery is beautiful (obviously). The morning we decided to go it was pouring rain so we slept in and went in the afternoon. At first we were disappointed  but if you had a bit of patience then the clouds lifted for spectacular views!  We did get some mixed directions, bus drivers saying they weren't going to a specific place then another one telling us we need the bus we just got off of but other than that it was fine.  It was not our first trip to China so didn't expect for there to be much organization or English which is where google translate came in handy!"
225,Bucket List Checked: Amazing Tour,The National Park is huge and would take a few days to cover. It is recommended that one spend about 3 days here since the ticket you purchase is valid for 4 days. Do stay at the hotels around the area so that you can access the National Park easily. It would be a hassle to have to travel back and forth from the main city for one to two hours Everyday. The avartar mountains viewing pointing are usually crowded with tourist but there are many other areas of the park where one can hike to to get unobstructed views of the other stone mountains. Be sure to hike the other routes so that you can get better photos
226,Recommendation for Zhangjiajie National Forest Park,"Amazing park, you even buy ticket for 4 days because it is huge! If you want to see all of it you need a lot of time and not a one day! Evene thoug hwe just had 1. Incredible"
227,Awe-inspiring scenery,"It can be cold, due to altitude so go when it’s warm.  March and April are still winter.Lots of stairs to climb, buses to ride, but it is worth it.  We stayed at the Pullman Hotel which is close."
228,I think it would be great...,"This is a beautiful 5 star NP with incredible scenery and great infrastructure.  You need minimum two days in Zhanyiaye NP and a day to visit the nearby Tianmen mountain and the very large cave.  If you can get into the park early,  or visit the park during shoulder season, you may enjoy the incredible scenery with fewer tourists around.  Do not be discouraged by the weather,  it is constantly changing and the hanging cloud makes the mountain so much mysterious and pretty.  The other highly advertised attraction, the glass bridge is more or less a tourist trap with only many bodies of tourists to look at."
229,Spectacular,"Avatar mountainThis is most beautiful place in the world. Must be see it. Also the people, who live in this place very hospitality and so many kinds of food. I and my family was very happy to visit this place."
230,Beautiful and magnificent scenery,"You must visit there with good physical able and able to walk on steps. Definitely worthy. Also, walk with a guide is a must. You won't be disappointed."
231,Best to visit on a week day,"So where to start. We been lucky because the weather wasn’t so nice and we been there one week after national holiday so I guess many people stayed at home :-) but don’t get me wrong, a lot of people were there anyway :-)But once you go up the stream you might find less crowded places.Recommend to use the whole 4 days the ticket is valid. It was really worth it.Be aware that up in the mountains are no ATMs :-)"
232,Fogged out.,"hopefully, you will read my other posting as it contains photos from this area. I had a great time. Jinbian Brooke an easy walk for young children."
233,Must see ,Me and my family have enjoyed our new year celebration in Zhangjiejie and it was so amazing to visit the park 3 days in row to see the most of it.  It was unforgettable experience especially to be in Avatar mountain.
234,Incredible landscapes,"Expensive entrance fee and attractions inside the park but definitely worth it. Zhangjiajie is a beautiful place with many breath taking sights; wear sensible foot wear and bring a raincoat for unpredictable weather. It is best spent going to the ridge top via  a cable car You can then enjoy the scenery along the ridge and then descend either  an elevator, or walk up and down the alleged seven thousand steps.  Truly unique scenery, that can be highly atmospheric when shrouded in mist, or at sunrise and sunset. The avatar mountains viewing pointing are usually crowded with tourist but there are many other areas of the park where one can hike to to get unobstructed views of the other stone mountains. A must see location in Hunan province."
235,What an incredible place,"As you can find in many places in China, it has breathtaking views with peaks. Worth visiting in your life time. Just too many people..."
236,Exceptional,"This national park is a must to go when you come to ZhangJiaJie. The scenery is good but is only when there is not too crowded because as you know the china people are too rude and they will push you all the way when they are visiting those travel spots and disturb you from enjoying the nice scenery. Besides, when you are queueing properly, always aware there will have some typical china people will cut the line. You shall hold your right and scold them for their rude actions.But anyway, please enjoy the trip."
237,Glass bridge and mountain track,Zhangjiajie National Park is huge and can take up to 3 days to fully cover it in peak season due to the queues for elevator and cable car. I went in down season so luckily there were no queues and I had the cable car all to myself. Go early in the morning as the cloud are quite low and you can get the perfect view of the floating mountains seen in movie Avatar. The beauty is truly magnificent and worth a visit. The park itself is quite massive and extremely hard to navigate. You are bound to be lost and can walk for hours if not directed correctly. No one speaks a word of English hence asking for directions doesn’t help. I recommend taking a tour of Zhangjiajie that includes accomodation and airport transfer because taxis are very expensive as they do not use metre.
238,STUNNING _ the place all Chinese wish to see before they die!,"If you haven’t seen the movie Avatar, you will want to see it after you visit the avatar mountain. If you have, you will want to see it again. Out of over 3,000 columns James Cameron picked out one. It is now the famous Avatar mountain. When we visited, we got extremely lucky to have the weather cloudy just enough to look like the floating mountain which was the reason why that particular column was chosen to be in the movie. You have to be there to see the magnificence and unexplainable nature’s creation. However, the entire park will take weeks will visit. If your time is limit, take the cable car and get to the Avatar mountain. It will take most 1 day already. You will see an incredible view you won’t be able to see from the mountain."
239,4 weeks trip in Asia,"The scenery is the first class in the world. However, there are a lot of wild aggressive monkeys in the park. I saw two rob tourists of their fruit and I was bit by one out of blue. I didn’t have anything in my hand. The monkey came from my left side when I was looking far ahead and bit my arm. When I creamed and tried to escape, it bit me again. I had to rush to a hospital nearby to take care of the wounds. So stay away from those wild monkeys!"
240,Pandora with snow!! Amazing,"This part is the main reason why you're visiting Zhangjiajie, and you must try to visit. There are many trecking route and many attractions, so plan ahead and prepare well, and spend enough time.  The weather condition is crucial, watch for season to visit and the weather report."
241,If you knew this place existed it would be on your bucket list,"amazing views, best days are cloudy so you can see the perspective, don't take a guide, busses are free"
242,Well worth the trip,It was my dream for long time to go to visit this place. Even when weather was not very convenient (rain and too foggy) magic was still there. i do recommend to visit this park
243,Stunning view,"Huge park with amazing nature spot, ticket include 4 days, price 270 rmb, in low season it’s the half.  i went in January before spring festival i think is the best, almost empty to amazing experience without people, not need to wait for nothing and lonely nature experience. i had lucky with the weather so was perfect. Here my trip and recommendation…  i arrived in the night flight to Zhangjiajie airport, i take a taxi for 100rmb to Wuljiayu village, dinner and sleep. 1ºday woke up late, visit village, early lunch   then i take a taxi to the mean Entrance in southeast (closed one to Golden whip stream) and i check in in hotel near entrance. 10 min car from village. You can stay also all days in Wuljiayu village there is an entrance nearby but i think is better the another one.  buy the ticket in entrance and went to Golden Whip Stream, 2-3 hours go and back, flat and easy route for first contact. in winter at 18 is dark already. 2º day Yuanjiajie + Tianzi mountain, wake up at 07:00, go entrance, bus 5 min + walk 15 min + bus 6 min, cable 8 min (60 rmb single trip) arrive on top, take the bus to Tianzi mountain 20 min, visit aprox 2-3 hours. full of place to eat.  after take bus to Yuanjiajie, aprox 20 min. i stopped to visit arranging battles platform (30 min) and shengtan gulf (30 min), very worthy and nobody. Arrive Yuanjiajie Visit around 3-4 hours, go back, same route than go, cable close at 17:30 ¡¡ 3º day yellow stone village, woke up at 07, from enter take bus 4 min, cable 8 min (70rmb single ticket) go around aprox 3-4 hours max. round path, easy and short. then go back WALKING, front mountain path, the another one is closed in winter.  super nice aprox 1 hour and half, don’t take the cable. arrive 18:00, check out and taxi to Zhangjiajie city check in hotel near cable station of Tianmen and dinner. 4º day tianmen mountain, see my other review for this visit, also very worthy, go back at 17:00 and go to airport to take the flight. IF you are short of time avoid Golden whip stream and wake up early first day to directly  my 2º day so can do all in 3 days."
244,Amazing,"Definitely worth visiting. Although the weather was cold, wet and foggy, we still could experience the beauty of the mountains. We stayed at Tongfu Inn in the park’s territory and felt like staying with a Chinese family. Try to find time for Fenghuang, an old town about 4 hours bus ride from Zhangjiajie."
245,The great formation,"Get your shoes on, wrap up as this park can get cold. Not easy to navigate as not all the turn offs are easy to see. Poorly marked."
246,Second Try,"As suggested by our guide, we started by taking the cable car to Tianzi mountain. The morning was foggy and cloudy so the view was very limited. After 11 am, the weather started to improve, and we had some beautiful shoots of the floating mountains.We had an early lunch in McDonalds since it was the best choice in the park, then moved by bus on the top of the mountains.We reached Bailong elevator by 3 pm, there were almost no waiting, very moderate queues for each of attractions (cable car, elevator and buses). Nothing to compare with the hours of waiting mentioned by other travelers. It was actually a pleasant surprise.Our tour ended by a small walk in the Golden Whip stream, enjoying the beautiful sceneries.Although the price is high, the landscape is completely worth it."
247,Pandora had better weather,"Zhangjiajie National park is a beautiful place and nature there is amazing. There are thousands of tourists every day as in every place in China, so be prepared for that. I would definitely recommend this place to visit, but if you are going there because of nature, you have to avoid places with crowds of people to enjoy this peaceful and inspiring place. There you can find a few hints, how to do that. We have been there for two days and you definitely need more time, if you want to see the whole park. We started our visit at the Entrance A, where we got by public bus from Zhangjiajie city and then went to Yellow Stone Village with a cable car. There are nice views of the park from this place, so I would recommend that for a visit. After we got back down from mountains, we were exploring a Golden Whip Stream, which was very nice walk around a beautiful and clear river. After the rest place called Zicao Pool we started to climb the mountains up. I would definitely recommend to go to the top of the mountains by yourself on foot and not to go by elevator, as there were so few people and the way up was totally managable with stairs. Local people and guides told us not to do that, because its too dificult and it takes 5 hours but its not true. We got to the top just after 1,5 hour even that we had got 12 kg backpacks and we totally enjoyed the way up also as first views of mountains without people everywhere around. The rest of the day we were just enjoying the views of avatar mountains. We also wanted to spend the night out there on the top in the tent, but again, local people were discouraging us because of monkeys and snakes. So after long time of thinking, we decided to sleep in some guesthouse on the top of mountains near to the Avatar mountain. Then we went back to see the sunset and met a local boy, who were sleeping just under blanket right in the viewing spot of avatar mountains. When we asked him about snakes, he told us there are none and also that monkeys won´t hurt you, so its totally safe to sleep there. So you should not believe local peoples who just want money from you for a accomodation or taxi and so on. We were there for sunset and also for sunrise and both were beautiful and also without any other people there as everyone was away from mountains. The next day, we spend some more time there and then took the bus to Tianzi mountain and went down. I would recommend to go again by yourself and not by cablecar, as there are no people on the way down by foot and you can see nice places as Southern Heavenly Gate and so on. We left park at the Entrance B and went again by public bus to Zhangjiajie city."
248,"Amazing place, very worth it to go not only once","Firstly, you do NOT need a guide to visit this park.2. The entire path is paved and is easy to do. Imagine the Bailongnelevator as the center, flanked by Huangshi on the left and Wulingyuan on the right. 3. Two days are enough for you to see this place. Eg. Imagine seeing the Grand Canyon from 200 sides! 4. There are free Park buses which taje lazy trekkers to EACH and every viewing point of the mountain.5. A) You can stay in the city or close to the Tiamen Mountain or take a bus 1 hour away from the city and stay near the Zhangjiajie Park. At Zhangjiajie you can stay at the Park entrance OR in the Park OR at a distance from the Park.B) The Park has 2 entrances -1. the Huangzhou Mountain Entrance (your left side of the map)2. The Wulinyuan Entrance (right side of the map). I would recommend you stay on this side as there is a lot more to do.Don't worry about not speaking the language...There are English signs everywhere. Also there is google translate but get the VPN in place beforehand.Things to see - The Park tickets can be bought online. It's a single ticket for 4 days. 1. Start your day by visiting the zhangjiajie canyon. Book your tickets online. Important! Carry your passport and camera and nothing else is allowed. Take the cable car and reach the Glass Bridge and walk over it. Then descend through a lovely easy safe walk down the canyon. The elevator is also there for a small bit of the descent (a floor I think....If you have bought a combination ticket...This is included). Walk along a green stream and take a boat ride which drops you back to where you started. You can either do the Jangling Cave or go to the Mountain.2. For the Mt -Take a bus to the Park entrance. This you must pay for 12 yuan.Switch at the Park entrance to another Eco Park Bus that will take you to the scenic spot that you would like to visit. Take the cable car up or bus up to the Tianzi Mountain first.3. Look at the map and descend stop by stop viewing the places as you descend.4. The Bailing Elevator brings you down really fast and it's worth it. Then take the Eco Park Bus, it will drop you to the Park entrance. One must be careful not to miss the last bus to take you down. Then you can take a local bus/cab back to your hotel.5. Next day take the elevator or Eco bus up to Yuangiajie.The bus comes very often.visit the 10mile Natural Gallery. See all the sites. There is a mini train that takes you up and down though I enjoyed the walk down.6. Take a bus to the Heaven pillar. See the sites7. The walk down the Golden Whip stream takes you to The Huangzhou Village. It's a 7km trek.the trek ends at the 1st entrance of the Park at Guangzhou Village. 8. You can take the cable car up and see the view from there. Again, a word of caution for the last departing Eco bus and public bus from the gate. Things get a little nasty and cab guys play up a lot. If you happen to be staying at the Wulingyuan side of town,then move out fast as it costs 200-250yuan to take a cab there. Sometimes the tunnel connecting these two parts of the Park is closed or under repair. This happened to me and the alternate route was long, radius and scary. It was not tarred, pot holes, not lit and cost more. Be careful.9. Tumamen Mountain has a cable car that runs over a noisy bustling city to the mountain. There is another small ledge glass bridge to walk on and similar sites to see.I stayed at Shanghaied Yuhou Sunshine Inn. It was situated right outside the wulinyuan section of the Zhangjiajie Park. I stay at 5 star hotels all over the world but they take hospitality to another level...Planning your day with you, dropping you free to the entrance, sharing food, BEING ThERE AS YOUR FRIEND IN CASE of trouble (when the tunnel closed and I missed the last bus)....She will get her sister and friends to speak to you in english if you so require. Truly, I couldn't have asked for better hospitality. The room I got was with the mountain view. Hot water, and comfy clean beds. Room is air-conditioned. They even organise tickets for you at local rates. +86 744 5559110Have fun!"
249,Cool & fresh air..,"Amazing landscape and nature, but unfortunately very touristic with mass of chinese people. The place is not really known by foreigners, you find only couple of them because the place is not that popular in the west or rest of the countries world wide. You must go early in the morning if you want to take good shots without 1 mil chines around you."
250,Stunning beauty but hard to get by ,"My husband and I had a wonderful time visiting Zhangjiajie National Forest and Tianmen mountain with Jeffrey Tang Ming as our guide. He is very professional, knowledgeable and knows how to navigate the crowds!  Above all he is very flexible.  We recommend him highly!  All our communication prior to trip was via email with very prompt replies.  We put down a small advance payment via PayPal and paid the rest on arrival in Zhangjiajie.  Jeffrey’s email address is zjjtripadvisor@qq.com"
251,Fantastic,"Wow! The whole area is absolutely amazing and you definitely need a guide as it very difficult to do without. We found Bruce in the reviews here and we are so glad! We spent 4 amazing days with him as our guide, visiting the park, the grand canyon and Tianman mountain. Bruce's English is perfect, and he's very informative, he made our trip so easy, hassle free and just amazing!We would deffinitly recommend him for a tour in Zhangjiajie.Thank you Bruce!"
252,Good hike,I visited this area as part of a tour. It is such a beautiful area and I recommend seeing it if you can. I come from a very scenic country myself (New Zealand) and I really appreciated this scenery as well. We went when it was slightly foggy which was disappointing for us but it was still amazing. It is super busy up there but they have built the walkways very well to maximise the views and give yourself a good hour and a half to walk around the entire walkway to get the best views. I convinced my tour guide to let me walk down instead and I really enjoyed that! Would have loved to walk up but I enjoy walking up steps so if you don’t then I do t recommend.It’s all stairs! But was nice to stretch the legs and get amongst nature and if you should need there are guys selling rides in carry chairs for you!
253,The best place I've ever been!,"The sandstone pillars are grand, magnificent and inspiring. You admire the sheer verticality of these natural spires and stone structures. On a clear day, the peaks seem to dot the landscape across the valley (石峰林 is amazing). There is a multitude of viewing spots where visitors can gaze out at the scenery. What disturbed the serenity of the place were the raucous tour groups walking everywhere with tour leaders shouting into megaphones. Incredibly noisy, but that’s China tourism."
254,2 days in Zhangjajie,"Went there in August 2017 with wife and two kids.  We fly from Guangzhou baiyun airport to Zhangjiajie heihua airport.  It is about 2 hr flight.  Tickets purchased is good for 4 days (247 yuan/person) and there are no one day or two days tickets.  Due to time constraints, we only Spend 3 days in Zhangjiajie National Park.  It is worth the cost and trip though.   It is a huge beautiful park.     We went there on our own and purchased tickets through a relative of mine in China.  We like the freedom of go and leave as we please without the hassle of a tour group.  We live in Wulingyuan area and take the No. 2 bus to the front gate of Wulingyuan entrance every morning.  Bus ride is about 15 minutes.  A warning:  most restaurant food in Zhangjiajie is spicy, even when asked not to make it spicy, it will still have some spicy to it.  Very hard to find food that doesn't have some sort of spicy in it.  First time entering the park, your fingerprint will be recorded and tie to your ticket.  This is to prevent people from selling the tickets to others for the days they didn't use.  Once inside, there are free buses that take you to different areas.  you have to choose from several lines where each line is for going to a different scenic area.  The name is listed in Chinese and it is not the name of the big area such as yuanjiajie, but a smaller tour area such as the golden whip stream.  It is kinda confusing the first day even for someone who can read some Chinese like myself which line to go, so be careful which line of bus you go on.  Due to the huge park area, if you ride the wrong bus, it will take you between 1/2 to 1 hour to get back on the right track by bus.  There are 3 main ways to go up to the mountain where most of the viewing areas are located.  By cable car at the foot of tanzi mountain (cost 72 yuan each way/person), by the straight up elevator at yuanjiajie (cost 72 yuan each way/person), or walk up the mountain at the ten miles scenic route.  The walk up way is only recommended for those physically fit and like the hike.  We did the hike the first day we went due to riding the wrong bus, instead of going back we do the hiking.  It is a 3 - 4 hr hike with mostly 60 degree incline stone steps.  Bring plenty of water bottles if you are going to do the hike.  Although there are plenty of little shops along the way for you to buy Chinese snacks and water bottles, the cost is about twice the cost outside the park for similar stuff.  One of the good about the hiking way is there are much less tourists and many good view points to take photos and enjoy the beautiful mountain views on the hike up the mountain.  To keep my kids going on the hike, the goal is to reach the McDonald restaurant on top of tanzi mountain which is the end of the hike where we will be able to sit in an air conditioned room and enjoy some cold sodas and fries.There are free bus rides going between yuanjiajie, yangjiajie and tanzi mountain areas.  But the bus ride usually takes between 30 to 40 minutes between the areas through curving roads in the mountain.  We have a lady throw up on the bus ride due to the many curves the bus has to go through from one place to another.  Almost like having a roller coaster ride.  So a warning to those with inner ear balance issue to not eat too much before the bus ride.Also expect the crowd when going during the peak tourist season as we have in august.  To avoid the crowd, either go early in the morning before 7am or late in the afternoon around 4 pm if possible.There are many places on the mountain that will provide a good view other than the over crowded popular viewpoints.  One of the fun part is to explore the places and discover them.   different time of the day presents a very different scene of the mountain and I recommend spending at least 3 days to fully enjoy the beautiful mountain view and suck in large quantities of fresh mountain air."
255,Great place,Wet and drizzling season in end May. Views would be so spectacular with more sunshine. It was a really good trip with Frank as our private tour guide. The landforms were really different. Hope this place stays the same! Included a map of the scenic whole area. Hope it helps!
256,"Unique, unforgettable, surreal scenery","When coming to Zhangjiajie we recommend you to take a guide, even if you are old enough to find yourself your way, but as it was  foggy all the time our guide Ann was able to find the right places to admire the wonderful magical landscape of Zhangjiajie and to avoid spend money to visit places where finally could see nothing.  If you are not go over the glass bridge, you will miss nothing. If you don’t take the elevator it is no problem as the spectacular view is on his foot. Ann will tell you where and when to go, she helps you in every way as she has the right connections . Thank you Ann for everything!"
257,Magnificent! (not guided walk),A beautiful spot. Lots of steps but OK even if not fit if taken steadily. There are various options to take depending on fitness & time available. Well worth visiting.
258,Wonder of the world.,"I think it's different in every season, but you need more time to enjoy the views. There are much too many people, sometimes not knowing the basic rules of a traveler's behavior..."
259,A most wonderful view from the beginning to the end.,"An absolutely stunning National Park with spectacular geomorphology. Enter from a number of different entrances and travel by cable car, elevator or use your legs to rise up into the park to view spectacular needle like mountains. We travelled from the East gate entrance by free bus to the cable car one day (additional cost over and above the park entrance) and walked to the top through the 10 mile Gallery on our second day. The cable car ride is well worth it and the walk is up never ending steps and paths and takes around 2.5 hours. Lots of Chinese visitors although it was quieter on the Monday rather than the Sunday. You walk and travel around the park on the free buses but you can get away from the crowds quite easily to find yourself in quiet parts of the park. Plenty of place to eat within the park.A definite Must do attraction for visitors to China. You can travel to the park by train or there is an airport approx 1.5 hours drive from the park where we flew to Nanjing."
260,Tian Zi Mountain and Yang Jia Jie the best part,"Zhangjiajie national park is extremely beautiful n worth a visit. Its a huge area to explore the beauty of the park which can done by shuttle bus, trekking n cable cars. But there are no English signs/ instructions so it becomes difficult to understand which way to go or bus to take. As we stayed there for 2 days only and while visiting the national park using bus we ended up wasting too much time to find our ways and so couldn't visit all the places we wanted to see. So from our experience, the best way to explore the park is to hire a car avoiding the chance to get lost and be able to visit all the attractions."
261,Incredible!,"The ticket costs 248RMB and is good for 4 days. If you have limited time to visit the park, then you just choose the areas that you want to visit. But if you want to enjoy the view, maximize the days that you are allowed to visit. make sure you arrive early as is can be quiet crowded in the mid morning. There is a restaurant and so many souvenir shops on top of the hills, if you don't want to carry. You can go around the park even without a tour guide as you can either follow where the others are going or just follow the map. I was able to book a room just about 5 minutes walk from the park for 200rmb per night. If you like ""nature"" and would like to maximize the allowed days of entrance and just laid back and be lazy, I suggest you get a room near the park, that way you could catch the sunrise or the sunset, and no need to rush going back to the city."
262,Sublime vistas and trails,Just beautiful and serene. Amazing view though it was foggy but as the day moved on it became much more viewable. Mother Nature at is best. Not to be missed compares to Zion or Bryce in USA
263,Spectacular,"Be prepared to be amazed, no matter how many times you've heard about this place. The scale of Nature and how humans built harnesses (cable cars, elevators and such) simply is mind boggling to me. We had a fantastic visit to the park, it was a bit crowded, so I suggest non-peak times and perhaps during or Spring or Fall for a leisurely visit and even better colors. Look at the size of the cable cars in relation to the jagged mountain pillars ... We had a great tour guide, that made it even more enjoyable. Take a good SLR camera for some mind blowing pictures to show your friends. Get there early, so you can capture the fog rolling in. Private vehicles are not allowed inside the park. Food choices are limited inside. Be prepared to walk. A LOT. farther you are from the crowds, better views and pictures. Dont miss 10 mile gallery - all the associated stone structures - well maintained and accessible! Definitely will visit the area again during another season."
264,My trip,There is much climbing so you should be fit to do this and wear comfortable shoes. But the views are worth it and you will remember this place for a long long long time.
265,Really stunning & magnificent. Devote 2 days to the main attractions.,"The whole area is mainly outstanding rock formations, used for the filming of Avatar.Together to see most of the park you need at least two days as it involves a lot of time quequeing for busses and then a lot of walking.It contains a variety  of different areas, most of which are subject to separate reviews, such as the elevator.The weather also has a bearing, on the two days we visited the weather was good, a bit cloudy the first morning.  Thenfollowing day it tipped down with rain, the whole area gets plenty of Rain!"
266,Great scenery,"Zhangjiajie is unique in the world and full of awesome vistas, forests, and a lot of Chinese tour group replete with competing loud speaker tour guides. How to get the best from this amazing place.We stayed at the Wulingyuan gate, full of great hotels and food, and a short walk to the gate, the South Gate from Zhangjiajie town is quieter but much more of a mission at the start of the day. From the Wulingyuan gate there are only 2 bus routes, one to Bailong Elevator and one to Tianzi Mt Cableway. Recommended not to take the elevator but to take the spectacular Tianzi Cableway from which there are buses across the back of the mountain to the Avatar area, if you are early you should be able to miss the crowds. The linking walk inside the park is along Golden Whip stream, close to the Bailong Elevator, a glorious and easy walk from which you can access the Yellow Stone Village and Avatar areas, though going up they are both tough step slogs, best done from the top downFood is everywhere and there are quieter areas though one of the best is to take the electric car along the back road from Sancha station, there are great views below the scruffy village.If walking the Golden Whip then the cable up to Huangshi Village and the walk back down to the stream is too much, there are return buses from the Southern Gate to Wulingyuan.Hope this helps, it is all quite easy really and very slick transport options. Go early and stay ahead of the tour groups."
267,Add it to your bucket list!,"We spent 2 days here, it was beautiful and well worth the visit. I would stay for 2-3 days to get the most out of it."
268,Stunning ,Lots spot to see. Preparing 2 days for full sightseeing of all national park. Prices RMB248 per adults for 4 days entry. Worthed to visit. Must use comfortable shoes. As each day we can walk until 15000 steps. Must know the right tracks to have nice journey
269,Big disappointment,"Beautiful place! We would have loved to be there early to see the spires above the clouds in the morning, then watch the sunset. Too bad our guide picked us up from the hotel at 10am and rushed us out by 3:30pm. Ask your guide to plan your trip accordingly to optiimize your stay at the National Forest Park and Tianmen Mountain."
270,Beautiful mountains! Must see!,"So much to see.  We had two days but it was worth it.  Def try to visit off season.  We were there in May, which is not high season, and it was crowded, but manageable."
271,"Beautiful, but overly commercialized. Not worth the money or hassle.","We spent several days in the park taking trips to the lower area on day one, upper area on day 2 and middle section on day 3.We spent 3-5 hours there each day Each day was very impressive and a different day in the park. I read another review on the buses that operate in the park and there is no cost to ride them when you pay park admission so don't feel like you are sneaking on. My wife and I were not in great shape yet we were able to hike all around taking a break when the steps going up were a little bit tiring. We are both 65 & 66 and because of that we were able to get many our tickets in the park and other attractions for half price. Doesn't hurt to ask and it can save you some money. FYI we visited the summer palace north of Beijing and there when I asked we got in free (with our passport for proof)"
272,Beautiful Park - Unlike Anything in the USA,Definately worth a visit. If you have bad luck you´ll see not so much when the clouds are deep. We had an amazing view.
273,Awesome,"Absolutely amazing scenic spot ! Make sure to arrive early though, otherwise you’ll have to wait a lot and it can get really crowded. You can read my latest blogpost on how to arrive 1st to the Hallelujah mountain on thevermilliontravel.com. Enjoy !"
274,Zhangjiajie National Forest Park,"We were blown away by the beauty and grandeur of the park.  The movie Avatar was filmed here.  We rode the gondola to the top of one of the mountains, walked through a peaceful valley along a mountain stream full of wild monkeys, were dazzled by the breathtaking views."
275,"Beautiful park, but won't satisfy you if you are looking for true hiking","I had the unfortunate situation of forgetting my hiking socks and wore regular thin ankle socks, and ended up getting some of the biggest blisters after our 6 hour trek through this park and it was worth it. Next time, I should have worn two pairs of socks. So, remember to bring very comfy hiking shoes and appropriate socks and prepare for long walks with some of the most unique and gorgeous sceneries in the world. We brought two 1.5L bottles with us and had just enough to get us through. We came across no stores and only two public restrooms as we entered through the west gate at Yang Jia Jie ticket office. Entrance to the park is 245 yuan and valid for four days (they jave fingerprint ID on each card so they cannot be transferred). They do not take Visa or any foreign credit cards so remember to arrive with cash if you buy from the Yang Jia Jie ticket office. Maps are 5 yuan and can be bought almost anywhere in the park from sellers. Get onto the bus and wait for it to head off. Buses typically only take you to the next stop before returning to their original point. We got off the first stop and did the trek on foot rather than the cable car, which we thought was a bit expensive (I think 76 yuan per person). We started on the path which is just a small stone staircase just up the road from the bus stop and followed the path counter clockwise. This was really great as it started us off in a section of the path that was virtually deserted for 90% of our walk, and we saw a monkey up very close (too close for comfort - he blocked our path and we contemplated each other for 10 minutes. When he got bored of us, he sauntered past to look for amusement elsewhere). It's not a very steep staircase at the bottom half but starts to get a little tougher later on. As it's used so little, we found the mossy stones to be a little bit slippery. There's also less rubbish than in the park near the south gate. It's a big place and will need about 3 to 4 days of you want to do most if not all the sections. We were happy with just 2 days of all day hiking. Extremely great place for photography or painting. Perfect place for some hiking. Note that there are millions of stairs in this park, so be prepared for some achy calves and thighs!"
276,"Magnificent views, lots of walking and climbing, truly amazing","Zhangjiajie National Forest Park Area contained the most popular areas which were always congested and required jostling for position whenever taking photos.  While an eyesore on the side of the beautiful cliff side, the Bailong Elevator is an impressive feat of engineering which carries 50 visitors up to the high area.  The 60 yuan price tag is steep but the only other alternative is a miserable steep upward climb.  The views from it for the last half of the ride is quite spectacular.  The elevator drops visitors off at Yuanjiajie Scenic Area where some of the most spectacular sceneries are which should look familiar for fans of Avatar.  The panoramic views of the rock formations from Enchanting Terrace had arguably the best perspective in the park.  The Gigantic Natural Bridge, an archaeologist that skies over the park few hundred meters above, is another impressive sight in the area"
277,Zhangjiajie national forest park,This is the place you should come at least once in your lifetime.No regrets to track the beautiful mountain and valley trial.Gather your guts to walk the glass bridge as well.Adventure well worth the time and effort.
278,Amazing place to visit,"We admit to have been to many high mountains & mesmerising sights of cloud covered hills, mountains & high climbs especially into China, namely ShiLin (where Journey to the West were filmed), HuangShan, GuilLin & many many more including Mount Sorak in South Korea during start of Winter whereby the cable cars are still working.  But this national Forest is yet another very lovely & the one & only piece of historical landscape.  Move along & you may get Avatar Hill, where pilots do flying Fox from plateforms & the show Avatar.  The sights of the moving clouds, the pictique cliffs & trees laden mountains.  Only being here, to take in the sight then the real picture could be imagine (definitely not in these few words).  Unless each individual is gamesome & younger, these mountains are not meant for those who are weak in the legs & heart.  Be prepared to enjoy the cool air during this Autumn, & the changing colours of the leaves.  Again, Winter if accessible will be very cold, slippery & a differing sight."
279,Magical place,"Quite foggy when get on the top that cause your view is limited but the world beautiful nature landscape that could make you feel huge. The Swiss technology cable car is so awesome to bring you a view from 1,400 m high. When I came there, foggy weather could not allow me to see so far distance."
280,Magnificent,"My wife and I visited Zhangjiajie National Forest Park the second day on our arrival to Zhangjiajie and we spent one and half exciting days in the park. Zhangjiajie's stunning natural beauty is indisputable and had certainly impressed us. All in all a marvelous experience, highly recommended."
281,Beautiful place,"In previous reviews, I have precluded my opinion with the caveat that travel styles are very subjective. So, I will give you an idea of my travel style, in order for you to determine if it is congruent with your own. When I travel, I prefer to ""do"" instead of just ""see"". When I go to a mountain, I envision hiking, photography, and a certain amount of communing with nature. My favorite trips have been those that are a bit ""off the grid"" and do not cater to the casual tourist or sightseer.With that being said, while I found the Zhangjiajie Mountains quite beautiful, like so many attractions in China, I found it overrun with tourists. Any peaceful communion with nature was interrupted by voices blaring through megaphones and hundreds of people stopping to take photos every step of the way.Do I think this means you should skip this UNESCO World Heritage site? Not necessarily. The views are stunning and there are some less visited routes you can take (warning: less visited means there is a little physical effort involved on your part!). One tip in particular: while visiting the areas surrounding the Avatar film inspiration site, most people will hop on a bus to the Ballong elevator. Instead of taking the bus, there is a stairway leading down to the Golden Whip Stream. If you take this pathway, literally within 120 seconds, the chattering of the crowd dissipates and you have a gorgeous view of the floating mountains literally all to yourself. It is incredible how close it is to the parking lot and most people completely pass it by in the rush to get to the next method of mass transit (as you can tell, I'm not a huge fan of the commercialization of the park).We spent all day ""hiking"" (all the roads are paved with stones and stairs, so the actual hiking is minimal--in fact, most people we saw were wearing regular clothes, jeans, and even heeled shoes). We went from the top of the Yangjiajie Cableway Station to the Ballong Elevator parking lot, down the mountain to the Golden Whip Stream, along the stream to the Four Streams crossroads bus, which took us a short ways to the Ten-Mile Gallery. The Ten-Mile Gallery (not actually ten miles, probably less than 3) is a beautiful jaunt through a canyon--it is not exactly serene since a monorail passes by every few minutes for those who are less inclined to walk. Again, if you are someone who enjoys nature, but cannot spend miles walking, then this park is incredibly accessible. But if you are someone who wants quiet and natural landscapes, you may be a little disappointed by the constant reminders of modern life.Most people would probably have taken the monorail back to the bus stop, but we made the choice to hike up to Tiantai Peak. We figured there would be less people since it required a lot of effort to climb. Well, a word of warning--my husband and I are both fairly fit and after over an hour of straight stairs (with many people laughing incredulously and telling us we had a long way to go), we were exhausted by the time we reached the top. And I am not ashamed to admit, that we were so worn out, we gleefully dined at the McDonald's built at the summit...Some practical tips: if you are worried about bringing food and drinks with you for your hike (which we originally were, having done long hikes where you need to rely on your own food and water), there is no need to worry here. There are food and fruit stands all over the mountain. And actually, the street food is quite good and cheap. Have cash if you don't have WeChat or AliPay. The buses stop running an hour before park close and the sky trams an hour and a half. This isn't like the USA where a friendly park ranger will escort you out if you miss your ride. We were literally stranded on top of the mountain with no way down because we underestimated how long our climb would take. Luckily, we found five other stranded foreigners and together, we walked down thousands of steps in the dark to reach the bottom--which may have been the most adventurous part of the trip!Overall, a nice place to sightsee if you are in the area.I think a day or maybe two at the most is ideal. There were a few other ""simple tourism channel"" paths (opposed to the ""standard tourism channels"") that may have been better suited to our tastes, but we didn't have time to see them all. This is a perfect park if you have trouble walking for long distances. But, if you are looking for an authentic hiking experience, this may not be for you.Be sure to check out my review of our lodging at the Tongfu Inn!"
282,Breathtaking scenery,"We spent two days in this wonderful park, and it was really worth it. It's a very long way to the top of the mountains, but once there the view is breath-taking. Some paths are very narrow and since there's a lot of people sometimes it gets very crowded.Wear something comfortable and take your camera with you!"
283,Nice but hard to navigate,Beautiful park and very large. They have shuttle buses to move people from different areas of the park. Prepare for lots of walking as the buses only get you near the famous sites. Extra cost for trams and elevator. Plan on spending a minimum of one whole day to explore the major sections of the park.
284,Amazing natural wonder,If you are a lover nature you will like the charm of the forest. If you like hiking so you can spend hours in the mountains and admire the beauty of our planet. The skywalk is not at all scary.
285,One of the best national parks in China,"The place is vast so put your running shoes on. Wouldn't suggest trekking during the winter. The view is mesmerizing and totally worth it. very cost effective especially during the off seasons. A little on the costlier side during the summers. The main highlights are the 10 mile gallery, the mountain elevator, sky walks and the ropeway. There's a free bus service inside the national forest park at our service till 6 o'clock. The officials are very helpful as well."
286,"Weight limit 10,000 kilos",Visited twice to the National forest park and still fall in love in it. Especially you have a clear sky with cloud below your feet was breathtaking. Taking shuttle car to Bailong elevator about 300m from the ground in 1.5 mins. The world fastest elevator and you would reach at the top of the mountain. Track the mountain with walk way build along the cliff so you can enjoy the view and feel the height! Tian Zhi mountain also part of the Yuan compound and is beautiful with the tall standing limestone formed million years ago. The avatar movies filmed here many years ago and made this a tourist favourite spot. Hence you would have to suffer with crowded local and foreign visitors but majority local mainland chinese all year round and even in Dec. I don’t quite enjoy as I don’t feel the peace to enjoy the view at all die tot noice and the crowd! He prepare to squeeze and push your way in order to get into the shuttle bus or elevator! You would take cable car ride back to ground with phenomenal view!
287,Natural beauty of the Earth,"When you arrive at the ticket office and tell them you are a student showing your ID as evidence, they show you a piece of paper asking you to pick from 1-4 (see picture). DO NOT pick 2 or 4. It’s a trick to say you can’t be a student if you are a junior doctor or a postgraduate student.The women we dealt with (pictured) called Song Qunying was utterly rude and unhelpful. She kept saying she wanted more information after we picked option 4. When we asked her to explain what she wanted to see as ‘more information’ she was unable to explain. She said as we were older than 23 we could not possibly be students.  As if to suggest a country such as the UK, would issue student cards illegitimately without proper checks and due diligence. The NUS and ISIC card is a widely recognised card globally. The card showed a photograph, place of study and expiry date. Frustratingly, these four options do not take into consideration that you could be studying for a second undergraduate degree therefore you are a postgraduate and an undergraduate. Either way whether you are 1, 2, 3 or 4 you are a student with limited income hence the whole point of having students rates or discounts all over the world. If they had stated a reason such as discount only for Chinese University students this would have been annoyingly but acceptable. We felt the piece of paper with the options was deceptive and unfair.Not only did we have to pay the full price, but had to continue to pay the full price for the cable cars (which should already be included, in the already very expensive entrance ticket in my opinion). This experience highlighted one of the fundamental issues with Chinese tourism - Each district seems to create it’s own arbitrary rules (our student ID worked perfectly fine with no issues in Beijing, Xi’an, Shanghai and Pingyao) with no flexibility, rational or scope for common sense to prevail. Whilst at the same time they are trying to fleece tourists for as much money as possible. This ruined our entire experience of the Zhangjiajie national park and we felt annoyed that we had no choice but to spend the money on the entrance fee, as we had already paid for 3 nights accommodation. Sadly, this experience has left a sour taste in our mouths about China, which we will be sharing with our friends and family in the UK!! The park is also full of thousands of tour groups with Chinese tourists obsessed with selfies and with tour leaders wearing microphones ruining the peace and quiet you would expect to enjoy at any national park. The use of microphones should be banned by the management at the National Park. Avoid this tourist trap and go to Yangshuo instead!"
288,Awesome!,First day we hiked up and took the elevator down. It was rewarding to climb all the way up but it was exhausting. On the way down we took the elevator. The second day we took the cable car up and hiked down. We came in December and it was cold but not that bad. In the mornings we all had several layers of clothes but after hiking for a while we peeled of some of the layers. The views are spectacular. We came during the of season which was great. We rarely had to wait. This is a place I would totally come back to.
289,A lot of walking/trekking,"Very beautiful views, unique mountains. It's a great place for hiking. I would suggest going there in spring/summer, but even Winter is fine."
290,Recommendation: Private tour guide with SUV,"As everyone here agrees, the views are simply stunning and you should really visit. Some specifics for your planning:We started from Zhangjiajie City, and it took in total about 2 hours with bus and walking and ticketing and the bus inside the park before we could start sightseeing. If you only plan to visit the NP for 1 day, I suggest you stay closer to the park, e.g. in Wulingyan.We tried to avoid the noisy Chinese groups by taking the walking trail up to Tianzi Mountain, which starts from the end of the ‘mini train’. It is quiet indeed, and it has very nice and quiet views on the pinnacles, but the climb is really tough. It took us a very warm, sweaty and tiring 3 hours to go up, although you are mostly in the shade of the trees.  On the top of the Tianzi Mountain, there are some locals offering a place to sleep. We had already booked something, but know that it is possible to stay overnight inside the park. It is quite basic though. The area around the Grand Viewing Platform (with viewing points like One Step, Peacock and Emperor, although names are different between maps and local signs indeed) is nice and quiet as well, although the views are slightly less impressive than at the popular sights. The Avatar area, as I call it, is just busy with groups. No way to avoid it, just buy an ice cream and try to ignore.We also took the walking trail down to the Golden Creek (or what is it called). This is also quiet, but has much less views than the path up we took at Tianzi Mt. We did see several monkeys here though. If you want to pick only one of the paths, I would suggest the Tianzi path. Food: that was a disappointment (or even a problem). There are only some snack stalls and a McDonalds, but there is no proper food, certainly not if you are a vegetarian and if you are a bit strict on hygiene. As the walking is quite tough, with many, many flights of stairs in humid heat, the lack of a decent meal contributed to our overall exhaustion. Bring some good snacks / bars / sandwiches / bananas with you (if you can find them). Bottled water is available everywhere at reasonable prices, so no need to bring much."
291,The blisters are worth it,"Original plan was to ascend using Bailong Elevator to  explore Yuanjiajie area etc. Then bus to Tianzi mountain area and descend via the cableway. Decided to change and reverse mode of ascent after buying admission tkts in view of the huge crowd (mainly the domestic tour groups) queuing for the buses to Bailong Elevator.After my visit, it was only a short queue to descend the Bailong Elevator. On reaching ground level, observed the queue to go up  the Bailong Elevator was still very bad."
292,A mountain top experience! ,"I'm so glad that I've made this trip. You must be here to experience for yourself the wonder and the grandness of these sights. We did this trip on our own as I like to travel at my own pace.  The park is huge and the attractions are either in the upper or lower section and the way to go from one section to another is either by walking up or down hills, taking the 2-minute elevator which costs 72 RMB one way or taking the cable care which costs 72 RMB one way also.  So you see that you must have a strategy on how to navigate through the park with minimal cost and energy. To cover all the attractions is a noble goal but maybe sensible only for the very fit people. To get to most of the attractions , it usually requires walking down and up of lots and lots of stairs.  Yangjiajie is the newest area in the park and I was told is the toughest. In addition to be realistic about how much to do or see, the other key factor to an enjoyable trip is to visit the park when there is no crowd. How would you feel after standing in line for a couple of hours just for tickets 2 or 3 times a day?  We picked late October which turned out to be perfect.  The weather was comfortable, the air was fresh and the park was very quiet.  Try to avoid major holidays like May 1 Labor Day week, October 1 National Day week, Chinese New Year week, Christmas and New Year week,..etc."
293,"Majestic, wonderful view",This is definitely worth a visit but take some time to do the longer walks away from the crowds.  If you don't speak Chinese go with a guide as some areas are not well signed and you will need to ask directions.
294,Zhangjiajie National Park Review,"Be prepared to hike a lot (lots and lots of steps) which brings you up down up down up down up down. Do your homework before coming here, the national park is so huge that the entry ticket enables you 4days straight (this also means that technically you need 4days to complete the whole national park). So do your homework and plan your route well to see what you want to see!"
295,Awesome landscape; picture perfect views,"We went early in the morning and we had a few places to ourselves, as the day wore on it got busy. Make sure that you have good shoes at the park is huge and there is lots of walking. Also good to have water and a hat. Words cannot express tha magnittutde of this park."
296,Could have been amazing ,Don't let the crowd distract you.  You just have to find your spot. The place is so beautiful. Nature at is best.
297,Brilliant,"If you visit zhangjiajie National forest park, do not forget the followings:1- once you passed the gate, make sure you're not holding any food or the monkeys will attack you and take it. That's what happened with us today. 🐒🐒🐒2- take the bus from the beginning then walk your way back. Because it's really a vast area."
298,Inspiration for Avatar,"Comparing Zhangjiajie, Huangshan and Jiuzhaigou, to me, Zhangjiajie has the best looking mountains. The walkways are very well developed and maintained. Four days recommended for Zhangjiajie Forest Park (at Wulingyuan), one day for Grand Canyon and one day for Tianmen Mountain."
299,World gem with postcard views,เห็นมี Review ชวนเที่ยวเยอะแล้ว เลยจะมาแนะนำการวางแผนเที่ยวให้ดีกว่า1. ทำความเข้าใจสถานที่ท่องเที่ยวให้ดี อุทยานจางเจียเจี้ย Zhangjiajie National Park เป็นส่วนอุทยานที่มีแท่งหิน อยู่นอกเมืองจางเจียเจี้ย 40km ส่วน สะพานกระจก อยู่ที่ Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon ห่างไปอีก 15km และ ประตูสวรรค์ Tianmenshan อยู่ในเมืองจางเจียเจี้ยเลย2. ทัวร์จากไทยมักจะไม่อธิบายให้ชัดเจน บางทัวร์ไม่ได้เข้าอุทยานด้วยซ้ำ ไปแค่สะพานกระจกกับประตูสวรรค์ แม้แต่ Review ในนี้ก็ยังเอาสะพานกระจกกับประตูสวรรค์มาปนกับอุทยาน อย่าเข้าใจว่าเป็นที่เดียวกันล่ะ3. บัตรเข้าอุทยาน ราคาเดียวเข้าได้ 3 วันติดต่อกัน (4 วันในหน้าหนาว) ถ้าอยากพักสบาย มีที่ช็อบปิ้งให้นอนในเมืองอู่หลิงหยวน แต่ถ้าอยากสัมผัสบรรยากาศจริงๆ แนะนำให้นอนบนเขาไปเลย โบนัสคือจะเข้าถึงที่ท่องเที่ยวได้ก่อนที่คนส่วนใหญ่จะเข้ามาจากอู่หลิงหยวน และไม่ต้องเสียค่า Lift หรือ Cable Car หลายรอบ ได้ของแถมเป็นวิวพระอาทิตย์ขึ้นและตกด้วย4. จุดท่องเที่ยวสวยๆ มีดังนี้a.
