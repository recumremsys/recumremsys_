Lots of people having selfies with very obliging police.

Lifeguards are numerous and alert to surf/weather changes. When it gets a bit warm head into the cool clear water. After your beach day, enjoy a cool drink & bite to eat at one of the many food stands/restaurants and bars or shop in an air conditioned mall. We enjoyed the sand sculptures which were up through 3/1. Just pay attention to parking signs as they vary in some locations due to the evening markets."

113,Surfers Beach - amazing!,"Very soft sands here, unseen elsewhere in my experience. Very suitable to spend time here in the beach for whole day, only if not that much sunshine, hahha"
114,Lovely,"Every day during our stay the waves were crashing into the beach and going for a ""swim"" was not an option.Playing around in the surf infront of the surf lifeguards was far better, a lot of fun, tiring and exhilarating all at the same time.Quite an undertow on occasions but taking heed of the advice of the lifeguards meant we had a great time. The views along the beach are awesome. Some of the buildings are works of art. Not to be missed if you are in the vicinity."
115,Amazing,"Surfers paradise is always a beautiful beach to visit with a family, partner, for a surf or just a walk!With clean soft white sand, rolling waves and a beautiful skyline view it’s always nice to visit.It’s patrolled along the beach so safe so families and children to swim at.🌊 🌅 ☀️ 🙂"
116,Great to see all the schoolies...,Lovely beach I love to look up at the sky rise buildings n hear the small planes n helicopters fly over..always action out on the water! The atmosphere is different their to any other beach. The night markets r awesome!!!
117,Beautiful beach!,"Although the entire coastline is beautiful white sand beaches, this beach is very crowded. You would do better to head north and pick any one of the beaches dotting the coastline for a more relaxing experience."
118,Stunning ,"The beach at Surfers is usually a stand-out on a sunny day - inviting water, a long stretch of white sand flanked by high rise buildings that meet the shoreline.  But in July it's a bit grey, gloomy, windy and cold.  The main reason for my review is that we noticed a lot of bright blue sea slugs in the sand.  Sometimes likened to Pokemon dragons these Nudibranch sea slugs  might look tempting to pick up for a closer look but DON'T  - they're toxic and have a poisonous sting. They are quite rare and beautiful but best to photograph only.  Apart from this hazard - parking is almost impossible close to the beach even in winter."
119,Fantastic long sandy Surf beach,Nice beach right in front of the heart of town does drop off a bit. Beautiful white sand kept very clean no litter. Lots of bench seats along waterfront and plenty of public toilets. Life savers and plenty of swim and surf schools running. Loved the Lest we Forget Monument
120,WOW! what  a fantastic Long beach!,"Awesome surf, currents can be challenging so be aware. But the life guards are really friendly and are happy to give advice"
121,Beautiful and Impressive beach ,"Water can get rough in afternoons but still shallow enough for youngsters .. paddling, wading and collecting shells .. boogie boarding and every half kilometer there’s a rescue lifesaver on patrol .. sand castles and very mild weather April to November Great winter space .. Waves break deep in ocean and gently on shore ..shopping in surfers is 6/10 but all the places - including woolies and coles and a great Tram/light rail service that travels between Broad Beach Pacific Fair and Helensvale (Helensvale is gateway to airport and Brisbane )Wonderful place ! No need to venture overseas !"
122,Party city ,Spent lots of time chilling on the white sand. Love the way they clean the sand every day.  nice time out
123,A great popular beach ,"Surfers Paradise Beach is very popular with tourists, and no wonder: a beautiful, white, clean, sandy expanse, with tempting, golden waters. Plenty of great photo opportunities to be had, with many towering buildings nearby, and coastline as far as the eye can see. There's outdoor markets on the promenade a few times a week. Well patrolled by life guards during the day, so as long as you swim within the flags and don't go out too far you should be safe. There can be a strong cross current and dumping waves, so take care."
124,Awesome place for short vacation,"This really is one of the best beaches in the world.Its clean, has shark nets and goes forever.The sand is beautiful. No importing sand here!You can walk for miles and miles. The water is pristine and is never colder than 19 degrees Celsius and goes up to 28 degrees Celsius in the summer. You should always swim between the surf lifesaver flags. Always use sunscreen and wear a hat. There is no way you could be disappointed with this beach experience."
125,Wake Up in Paradise!,"Beautiful clean beach, very well maintained surf life savers and police patrol the beach which makes you feel safer and you can relax"
126,Surfers Paradise is real Paradise,So much beach to have so many views to enjoy loved every bit of it neat tidy and clean ♥️ spent every day down there at some point

129,great place,i live at the beach in ca but the sand was so soft .the waves were rather small but all had lifeguards.there were showers on the deck.beach clean and well maintained
130,Beautiful  Sand,Very good experience.Clean and clear beach. weather was perfect and good place to take family for good 2-3 hours.
131,Long Sandy beach,Incredible great erosion a straight beach not good for surfing swimming so many buts needles in sand but looks picturesq from mall and view north south  good beaches noosa nth straddy southern Gold Coast
132,Sand is super soft,"This city marries International standard Theme Parks with nature at its best. The Surfers Paradise strp couples long beaches of golden sands with miles of safe surfing beaches that are always fully patrolled. Then a mere 400 meters inland there are waterway edged with immaculate private residences. Daily cruises along the canals is  not to be missed. Plenty of accommodation offering a wide range of pricing. The Australian food is wonderful - especially the seafood which is extremely fresh and with a  wide variety. Try Ashmore Steak and Seafood, you won't be sorry."
133,Beautiful Beach,"The GCCC have done a great job re-vamping Surfers Paradise Beach, lots of walking tracks. Highly recommend. Avoid on the weekend if possible as it will be exceptionally busy."
134,Place to be!,"We visited on New Years Eve and had a wonderful day, This is one of the best beaches I have ever been on. It was very busy but didn't feel overcrowded, the sand was lovely the sea was clear. However it was very strong and not suitable for young children my 3 year old was able to stand at the waters edge and paddle within arms length. There are sections that are patrolled by the life guards and I wouldn't swim outside this area. Every kind of shop is on the road next to the beach along with a vast array of restaurants/coffee shops. Everything you could want is a short walk away. Parking was easy along the sea front on a parking meter and was $4 an hour. There were showers on along the beach front but were very hit and miss. Would love to return and stay for longer next time highly recommend a visit to anyone who is in the area."
135,Amazing Spot,Best Shoreline and not very crowded in evenings. Street markets around the beach three days a week and lot of eateries and shopping destinations near the beach
136,Surfers Paradise Beach,It's just best place to relax. its sand is  outstanding. I have never seen white and clean sand like its.
137,Amazing,"Surfers Paradise Beach took my breath away. With the city skyline in the background, clean sand and clear waters this was an absolute must stop. Relaxing here after brunch nearby we soaked in the sun. The beach stretches for quite a ways so it is a great walk as well. Highly Recommend."
138,White sand,"If you like your beach filled with tourists and towering sky scrapers this beach is okay.  I advise to head south to Burleigh, Currumbin, Kirra or Coolangatta to experience the beautiful beaches and iconic surf breaks. You’ll feel much more connected to nature anywhere other than Surfers Paradise.  Ask any GC local where the best beaches are."
139,I’m in love with this beach,Plenty to see and do. Great for a relax and walk. Stay central as easy to get to everything with a drive.
140,Surface Paradise beach,"Beach was excellent.not far walking distance from the hotel, water was not cold and there was life guard to warn and save people if anyone in trouble"
141,Excellent beach,"Is beach is fabulous it goes for kilometres and it is subdivided in sections with lifeguards every 100 metres or so. The temperature is 21 in the water in mid nov. the sand is so fine gorgeous, long walks are a must! Make sure you swim between the flags, take an umbrella and sunscreen. Enjoy this little paradise for free! Australia you little beauty!!"
142,A great beach to visit in Gold Coast,Great beach they clean it daily surf lifeguards start at 0800 and the water is around 26 degrees c  nice strong waves and lots of people walking and enjoying the surf: lovely
143,Beautiful ,"Reminds me of Mount Manganui in New Zealand . Very lovely views, incredible sunrises and very safe feeling. Clean and with life guards. Haven't swum in it yet though."
144,Must be in Gold coast,We had some great family fun in the afternoons running around and swimming in the beach. From 3pm onwards it’s in the shade of the buildings which is nice. The water temperature in April was 25 degrees and it was really nice. While the ocean was a bit rough and there were some rips the lifeguards were always keeping an eye on everyone and keeping us informed.The beach was nice and clean and it’s was a great way to spend with family.
145,Stayed for a week ,What a fantastic beach. I could stay here all day. We even got to see some of the amazing sand sculptures
146,Nice beach with sky scrapers,Nice place to chill out.Have so many restaurants nearby.You can take pictures for Instagram at the Surfer Paradise Sign.
147,Lovely beech,"Lovely golden sand.   It must have been quite magnificent before being spoiled with all the highrise buildings casting afternoon shadows on the beach.  Was surprised at the bank of sand which made a difficult slope for older people to get up, so had to walk further along the beach to avoid it."
148,Great holiday,"one of the most beautiful beach with safety and security. Amazing view, Amazing environment, clean shiny and alive. You can see why this is the tourist best spot in the Gold Coast"
149,Avoid,Beautiful and enjoying a ocean fresh air. I was very disappointed with the Sea World expectation but the staff were good too and helpful
150,Very windy,"Huge beach with lots of lifesavers. It may be dangerous to get in the water, but you will always see lots of families and kids. Safe and clean beach!"
151,One of the best beaches in Australia,We walked along the beach front during the night markets.  It was very busy and breezy but enjoyable all the same.  Lots of tourists trying out the local arts and crafts.
152,Awesome beach,The complete holiday experience surrounded by beachside dining shopping bar and club. Don't miss out 🌞🌊
153,Once was great,Perfect for a holiday always something to do. Weather is fantastic. Good shopping precinct and lots of variety.
154,Beautiful Beach,"This famous stretch of Gold coast beach is near to many amenities, hotels and shops etc.I have frequented the beach many times and found it to have lots of people from many cultures and it's very refreshing to spend a few hours daily when holidaying."
155,Best Shoreline ,I visited this in September. I went with my family. It’s very beautiful beach nicely maintained. Anytime walk will be good but sunrise is fantastic. Beach is not far from market and hotels.
156,Catherine @ The Hilton Surfers Paradise,"A stroll after dinner, and also the next day. Happy people and magic weather. Perfect way to spend some genuine time with a partner. And plenty of venues nearby for dining."
157,Beautiful beach to visit ,We loved the reclining benches at Surfers Paradise and the shops are right behind you. (You could plan a day trip of shopping with relaxation time at the beach!) I wish we had a take away dinner at the beach but a walk afterwards was just as good.
158,Maria,"Surfers Paradise Beach is absolutely fantastic, we walked each day for hours long sandy Surf beach, what more could you want?"
159,Ocean Magic,"Lovely, clean, Sandy beach. Not suitable for weak swimmers though as it's a bit choppy. Windy when I was there too"
160,Great,"Part of a coastline stretching over 10km's, of pristine sand, this part, is the tourist mecca of the gold coast, consisting of sky scrappers, many clubs, bars and eateries, catering to all needs. the beach is lined with a esplanade,  that is excellent for stroll-in, (however be-aware of the electric hire bikes, scooters etc), with plenty of seating, even lounge areas. This place is definite must, to anyone visiting the coast."
161,Good beach day,"walk to everything , safe , lots of life savers , easy walk to food outlets  great for a family , lots of room and very clean"
162,One of the best....,"A surf beach is never going to be a place for a non confident swimmer. Nice clean beach, swim between the flags of you do brave the waves."
163,Fantastic first time visit to the Gold Coast!,"Already thinking about how to be back here in the future. Really exciting place, amazing weather and great beaches, restaurants and shops."
164,Skypoint,Can be a little rough at times. But very good. Beach was also next to excellent restaurants and shops
165,To expensive ,Not really a beach person but surfers’ has its own charm. Always plenty happening. Weather was great and a lot of tourists.
166,Beautiful beach and boulevard ,Actually not all that dramatic but had to be seen. We parked up and wandered along a stretch of the beach to see the surf huts decorated with some pictures showing the past history of the beach.
167,Great beach,"The sky is blue, and all the leaves were green. I had a swim. It felt nice. Not too sandy, and not too much water. It barely rained at all."
168,surfers paradise,"Loving here,  best place to spend few hours relaxing and then go to eat something with so many choice around here."
169,Breezy,"Great beach for walking at day and night, check night market day you can find something good made by local; maybe too many people visiting there is always an idiot make place dirty on chairs and toilets.. Suggest put more lighting and children activities in beach walk like south port playground very successful for family members with young kids."
170,A very popular Gold Coast Beach,"As always one of the best places to visit in Queensland. The beach is awesome with plenty of options close by to eat, stay and chill"
171,"Lovely beach, very shady!","Love the esplanade, we ride from Ashmore often, there is plenty of bike lock up areas and toilet facilities.  There are showers by the beach and loads of seating areas.  The beach is patrolled by Life Guards and the sand and beaches just beautiful, lovely atmosphere and loads of places to eat and drink."
172,mrs. Ruth beardsmore ,Surfers paradise beach is so beautiful but was so disappointed to see dog poo on beach other than that it's beautiful and our view of it from the q1 was amazing
173,great experience,"One of the world's best places to be perfect weather in winter, clean and so many activities and great places to eat in the area. World class one of the best places to be"
174,2019,"Its a nice beach but more good is its surroundings where lot of pubs , restaurants , shops , ice cream parlors, are to enjoy with view of beach with lot of tourists.  Sun bath is also amazing on the beach , its very clean water and beach side . September is not crowded so there are no sports this time ."
175,Fine white sand,"First time visit to Surfers Paradise and this is one cool place. A bit of weather warning when we arrived but the feeling is amazing, clean beach, all family friendly. Next to so many shops and eatery. Went there at night time too and enjoyed every bit of it with the family. Highly recommend if you in Gold Coast. At least spend a day or two in Surfers Paradise."
176,Good luck finding parking,"A long beach with lifeguards on duty but with limited other facilities; there are few rubbish bins, no toilets, no storage facilities, no beachside bars or eateries, no equipment rentals. The high rise blocks of flats immediately next to beach create unwanted shade, so not ideal."
177,Beautiful view ,"Miles of golden sands that are kept in beautifully clean condition. Great shower and cold water facilities. So much space, great waves and just about all the local amenities you could want (and a few you might not if you’re not into touristy stuff or the party scene at night) This was a great place to stay. Super friendly locals, safe environment for kids and the beach was better than any that we visited doing highway one in California. Loved it."
178,Beach time,"Highly attracted place for the tourists and each season more and more people select Surfers as their destination.Beach is very neat and tidy. Although we are not allowed to consume liquor on the beach, it still attracts lot of crowd. Pick Up you juices and head to the beach.Things to carry✅Towel✅Sunglasses✅Hats or Caps✅Sunscreen"
179,Great for a walk ,"Good place to visit ,markets on Wednesdays not very big market but good to take a stroll and browse some interesting things to buy also heaps of shops and pubs around for good food heaps to see"
180,Very nice beach ,"Always wanted to be in gold coast beach ...really impressive be magnificent. 65km of the beach seems endless. Not only it's clean, it's superb."
181,Clear Waters,Stayed nearby for a week and went to the beach most days. Always clean and well managed by lifeguards.
182,Wonderful place for kids !,"On a good Winter's Day, the Surfers Paradise Beach is spectacular and enjoyable. Also proximate to great eateries. Pleasant boulevard although have to keep an eye on fast electric bikes, electric scooters and bicyles. Well accessible by public  transport, including trams. Great city for a beach and city holiday."
183,One of the most beautiful stretches of beaches in the world.,"Very safe with swimming, as the lifesaving guys are always watching. I truly enjoyed my 3 days on the beach."
184,Must do,"The beach felt generally clean and safe. There are lifeguards during the mornings and afternoons and in the evenings, there are just so many people hanging around and relaxing, you won’t be alone. Loved that there are night markets 3 times a week, some of the things they are selling are actually quite good. The kids loved the beach, both morning and night. Just be wary that the waves can come in really quick during the evenings, so those with little kids shouldn’t leave them on their own at all."
185,55 kms of Beautful beach,"After visiting Sky Point, we just HAD to go on the beach. Being Brits Aboard, it was great to see the Lifeguards stationed on the beach entrance, with their gazebo, chairs,lookout tower and buggy at the ready!It was really Bostin to just lie back and think, ""yes I am lying here on Surfers Paradise Beach! We felt really safe and secure knowing we were being looked after!"
186,Head south for the best beaches,"I really like this Beach. Well patrolled , looked after and right across the road from anything you may need through the day."
187,How can you not love this place,"The highlight of Gold Coast and Australia's one of the most popular holiday destination. Expansive white beach and average water temperature of 22 degrees. The beach is endless and despite the thousands of tourists and locals who gather here everyday, it does not seem crowded. Ιdeal for surfing due to the waves. Plenty of sand play space. Lifeguards are always on duty. Within walking distance of the beach there are countless restaurants, fast food, cafes, bars and entertainment venues. Must be here at least once..."
188,Family get away,"We had so much fun in surfers paradise... Even though we are over 50.   Awesome beach, beautiful restaurants and cafes.  Would strongly recommend for a lovely relaxing time."
189,Surfers beach,"Nice family feel and very crowed , not for calm seekers , no Christmas fireworks and extremely expensive food services with 20% surcharge for the same or even less service except for MacDonald and hungry jacks , weather nice , too crowded beach markets , sand excellent limited beach life savers nice beach walk"
190,Perfect weather,"Want to spend a relaxing day at a beautiful beach? This is the one. Soft, warm, white sand. Cool crystal clear water. Walk along the breaking waves and hop across the boardwalk for good eats. Lots of choices!"
191,Surfers Paradise just beautiful ,felt like heaven.beautiful place to spend time with your loved ones.food options and motels was so good.
192,Home sweet home,Great place to take teens. So many things for the family to do. Everything reasonably priced. Very entertaining
193,Lovely beach,The beach still looks great after my revisit after more than 10yrs! Remember that they don't allow pets to be on the beach when we were back then but it seems that they have open up this rule for the pet lovers to share the beach with their furries.
194,Good Beach to walk along and people watch,Lovely beach but be very careful. Not recommended for small children or even adults that are not so good at swimming. Lots of rips although there are life guards the sand disappears before your feet and lots of unevenness. Lots of sections closed for swimming due to these rips. We ended up just paddling. Pool is a better option for small children etc.
195,Lovely beach,"Such a beautiful place and the sand is like no other. Even with lifeguards on hand, make sure you swim between the flags because the sea is rough... there is a reason it is called 'SURFERS PARADISE.'"
196,"Great beach, friendly lifeguards ","Surfers Beach? Clean, well patrolled by the life guards and safe. Part of the reasons why I live here..........."
197,Reclining benches,"Beaches are beautiful and are constantly cleaned every night, cleaners are out cleaning these beaches every night and are constantly maintaing their beauty"
198,Nice place to chill out,"Because of the high rises, the sun goes down pretty early.  No shelter on the beach from the waves. Great if you like surfing and waves.  Not great for small children / if you don't like waves!"
199,Stunning beaches,"An absolute must do for foreigners. Golden white sand for miles, steady waves. Be aware of rips and only swim between the flags as conditions in the water can be dangerous. Patrolled, even in winter!"
200,Lovely iconic beach,"We spent our holidays here for years and just loved swimming in the beach and now that we live nearby, we often stroll along the beach and pop into cafes along the way. It’s a fantastic beach and very touristy."
201,Nicely manicured beach,"It's always nice to have a break at this beach when we were staying in Hilton or Soul, it's right across the street and plenty of activities. There is also shower and toilet nearby when you finished. Simple get a towel and lying on the beach in a sunny day would be a pleasure during the holiday!"
202,Nice and clean,Love the long and wide strand it’s always clean and the surf lifesavers doing a great jobHave been to many beaches around the world but this one is one of my favourite
203,Lovely beach,It was a challenge  to  navagate the surf for swimming  as it  was  very rough  and  kept knocking  us down. By the time  you get  up the next  wave hits you.Mainly for  surfers. Great to walk  along and very clean.People very friendly. Still  loved  it.
204,Love this place,"truly am glad i followed my wife n daughter for a lovely,therapeutic walk along the world famous surferparadise,easily 2km n went again n again till time to gohome.Amazing sight of people, beach ,seagulls like u feel not moving from there at all.nearbye rows of shops,beer haven, adventure parks, river cruisses ,food  stalls n restaurants on n on FANTASTIC"
205,very stunning,"You would have more luck winning Lotto than finding a car park in Surfers Paradise. There are better beaches on the Gold Coast worth a visit. If you do find a park be very, very careful as you just might get a parking fine as I did. I would never go back there again. Palm Beach is much better."
206,White sand clean and tidy ,"Looking forward to VIVA Surfers Paradise 2020 - get in early and book accommodation. This was a great festival, well organised, with a wonderful array of vintage cars, an Elvis Presley event hosted by Dean Vegas, lots of events to suit all tastes, spanning a week or so. Browse the regular, interesting street markets, free music and entertainment. We even saw a white whale passing on its way north. Imagine that! Fabulous, well-run event with a backdrop of pristine white beaches and ocean breezes. Just magic."
207,Beatutiful Beach,Beautiful Beach to wake too.  Take an early morning walk to energise and get your daily dose of vitamin D.  Have a coffee along the way and a quick dip before heading back to work out where lunch will take you.
208,Fergus,"Love Gold Coast! You will need a car to see places. It is easy to get around by car. Check car park rates. Check weather and news.

209,Great family fun feel very safe,"It has been a long time since we were here last but it still is an amazing beach! It’s the only beach that the sand squeaks under your feet as you walk.With the white sand and a gentle surf at the right time it is a great place for all the family in or out of the water, a must visit."
210,Beach 🏝,Wow it’s blowing on this beach this morning! But how can you go wrong on a Gold Coast beach? Still perfect
211,The council and life guards do a good job,"Had a fabulous time here with family, crisp clean air in October and the weather was not too cold and not too hot. Everything is available close by, including great shopping and restaurants. Highly recommended!!"
212,Stunning,"I am a local. I love Surfers Paradise beach. I visit most weekends and you can’t fault the white sands, the cleanliness of the beach and the joy of people enjoying their quintessential GC experience. I love everything about it and coming here is my happy place. A must see."
213,World class number 1,"It’s lovely place to visit, parking is hard to get & super busy especially during events. But it is one of the biggest tourist places"
214,Drive the blues with bright blue!,"What more do you want? Surfers Paradise Beach is among the nicest beaches, though sometimes it gets busy but in April it was reasonably populated. The water was a bit coolish but nevertheless it is just relaxing to walk on the sand close to the water."
215,Beautiful beaches ,"Can get very crowded here, we preferred to go further down away from the crowds with our 3 year old granddaughter but of course if you want to swim you have to stay in main area with the flags, she just played in the sand."
216,Lovely beach we went during Viva so crowded ,"Plenty of room  for all , lots of locations with lifeguards on duty, parking can be an issue if you turn up late"
217,Viva Surfers Paradise,Really refreshing to be here. Very clean in spite of being the happening place in Gold Coast. Lots of Bars and Restaurants alongside the Beach. The place gets into a festival atmosphere in the evenings with roadside shops opening up selling local goods.
218,Awesome beach,One of the most beautiful stretches of beaches in the world. The beach stretches for miles and miles. Endless beauty.
219,VIVA Surfers Paradise 2019 was a wonderful experience,Warm- 26%- perfect weather...clean- picturesque- friendly beach....was happy to share the journey ..
220,Beautiful,Amazing here. Highly recommend it. Had so much fun chilling here and it's so close to everything! It's so nice there.
221,"The beach is superb, and great to enjoy. ",I unfortunately visited this world famous beach on a cloudy day.This is a beach I frequented numerous times as a child and adult as I lived in Brisbane for many years.This is very touristy and you woill find lots of hotels bars and restaurants in walking distance.A great family friendly beach and quite safe if one swims between the flags.
222,There's nothing to do here,"Even on a rainy day...no rubbish, well taken care of. Markets and activities are great in the area.  Felt safe on this beach. O"
223,Great beach on the Gold Coast,"Lovely fine sand enormous beech you can walk for miles was quite windy when we were there, but I guess if they never had wind they would not have waves"
224,Blue Sea Slug Warning,"Visited this beach on Boxing Day. If you enter the beach through the main “surfers paradise” entrance and turn left it’ll be miles quieter than you expect. If you’re not surfing too, the waves are slightly lower too. Amazingly clean and tidy beach too."
225,Very Pretty,"The vibes, energy and scenic beauty of surfers paradise is too good to be true. One can feel the pristine waters, carry out a number of outdoor/indoor activities and savour a vide variety of world class cuisine. One of the best places in the world for sure."
226,This is the Gold Coast,Beautiful beach but not at all protected from the swell. Southerly swell meant it was pulling strongly to the left and really not great for swimming
227,A great place to start your day!,"I have traveled extensively and this stretch of beach beats plenty others I have seen, including Santa Monica, Hoi An, and others. If you are escaping the colder climates of Australia and beyond, this beach will be all you need to feel fantastic. Beautiful clean sand, gorgeous rolling surf, superb sunrises and moonrises, all patrolled by Australia’s famous surf life savers. Ideal for romantic strolls along the beach. Don’t forget to swim between the red and yellow flags, and bring your sunscreen and hat. Who says there is nothing to do? Just enjoy the world class beach and stunning vistas."
228,Great Weather on Sufers,If you can avoid driving in Surfers Paradise it will be a far better experience for you. The road system is a nightmare and parking can be difficult to find. The beach is nice and now we can say we have been there and done it.
229,2 day stay,"Exactly like in pictures you see on TV. Though at times jammed packed with people, but OK as everyone is friendly."
230,Dog walk before dawn,The Gold Coast has always been welcoming and pleasant to holiday with our family or just a quick getaway with just myself and the wife.
231,Beautiful,"Great views, friendly locals and easily accessible 👍👍 would definitely recommend anyone of all ages"
232,Surfrrs Paradise,Thee is nothing better than a morning or evening visit to surfers paradise beach. You can see the whole Gold Coast line from beach. The waves are so big and relaxing. If you are in surfers paradise don’t miss the beach.
233,Had a great time,You have to come here! An absolute essential thing to see when in the Gold Coast. Get some surf lessons (from Go Ride a Wave) - totally worth it!
234,Amazing feeling and ecperience,The beach was lovely and very clean... was nice to have some time here... will be back again. The sand was clean and the sidewalks were kept lovely and cool. The gardens before it were tidy and clean as well.
235,INNOCENT ABROAD,"Very well worth going to!Clean, well designed, good friendly service.Fast internet everything you could want"
236,Huge improvements since my last visit,"me and hubby have a blast of our 3days there in staying in front of the beach , Surfers paradise is kind like ive been in other country but to me definitely one of the best places that ive been around australia so love it and the sorrounding areas are kind safe to walk around even the night time and some shops are 24hours , Will definitely coming back again next time."
237,Great days,"The Surfers Paradise Beach hasn't altered for more than 50 years, with a double break and consistent surf to enjoy.  There is plenty of sand to spend time sunbaking, reading, or just people watching."
238,"Golfing,Racing trip",Visiting from the UK I just had to go for a swim off the beach at Surfers Paradise (I haven't put any pictures of me swimming so as not to put people off!) The beach is well patrolled and the flagged areas where it is safe to swim were obvious so as long as you are careful there should be no problems and swimming in the waves there is just fun.There is also a lot going on behind the beach with cafes and shops galore.I suppose it is what is often referred to as an iconic place!
239,Paradise,"My grand daughter came on a four night break to surfers paradise, she loved the beach and can’t wait to go again."
240,Beautiful,"Surfers Paradise Beach - Gorgeous, pretty, charmingWe landed from flight at Brisbane airport coming from Cairns. By bus we went to Gold Coast. After lunch while coming to VOCO hotel, I got down with wife to enjoy the beauty of Surfers Paradise Beach. During our stay in Sydney and Cairns, we heard about the beach. After seeing the beach I realised that we heard less than the actual. Many birds were playing on beach and were coming to the tourists for grains. The beach is extremely popular to tourists for its multiple attractions. The sand is golden. The beach strip is long (three kilometre length), many high-rise buildings including the world famous Q1 building, with its SkyPoint observation deck. From the deck panoramic ocean and city can be viewed. There are also popular markets, several shops, cafes, diverse restaurants and lively nightclubs. I tried to take photo of the Q1 building. But I did not succeed to take photo of Q1 building due to incapability of my camera. Furthermore, I won’t feel shy to mention that neck pain developed when I tried to view the Q1. Therefore, tourists get anything they want. The “Surfers Paradise Beach” is Australia’s iconic beach. After spending about two hours we started for our accommodation in hotel VOCO. I am attaching few photos."
241,Fantastic Beach! ,"When in the Gold Coast you really have to go to Surfers Paradise beach which we did.  It was quite windy & chilly but worth going to see the waves.  I was expecting to see Surfers but maybe it was a bit early for them, worth a visit"
242,Clean and well maintained,I have been to many beaches all over the globe. This was one of the better beaches. We were there both in the morning as well as evening and enjoyed both.
243,A good place to be for all ages,"Really nice Abit windy but all goodI love the fact that they have areas to swim between the flags, exellent saftey"
244,May was perfect weather- I even got to swim in the ocean,"For just over six years now I have got to know the Esplanade & beach quite well at Surfers Paradise. There's always something happening throughout the year with many events to suit everybody. Great beach with lifeguards, though it's renown to be not the safest with a strong current for many. Do play it safe & swim between flags if not confident in water, it can be quite calm one day & raging two meter plus strong surf the next day! There a number of great cafés, restaurants & shopping malls in the area. For the party goers there are venues also to suite. People do have a love/hate relationship with Surfers,but does hold a special place in my heart due to many great sessions surfing with mates & coffee afterwards, plus a life saving situation one year surfing there. Parking is all around & also the GLink tram passes right through central Surfers Paradise also, get there & enjoy!"
245,Nice fine sand!,"Apart from surfing and drinking (of which there are many better places) there's nothing to do here, there's an old shopping strip and that's it. Worst place in Australia so far after travelling around NT and QLD for 2 months."
246,Perfect to watch sunrise ☀️,Ok. Let's me gets straight. This place obviously for surfer and swimming. Why should I come surfer at night. Except for sight seeing and pictures. A little bit of shopping. Eat and clubbing.  There are many street performers.
247,Pretty but crowded,"Super friendly locals. Beautiful, clean, safe and well organised city. Cool and relaxed ambience. Many choices for food, shopping and entertainment. Recommended for families, group of friends, couples. An experience i really enjoyed and will return!"
248,After Sydney Surfers Paradise is Austrlia's number one holiday destination for Austarians and number 2 for international,Good markets and good shopping and good food and good hare beading and good tram stop and good place
249,Best beach in the world,"A very busy coastal strip adjoins this broad strip of golden Australian sand. While the beachside shopping precinct might be a bit tatty, the sands are well maintained and patrolled. The actual surf is a little ho-hum on all tides."
250,Stunning Surfers,I really liked the beach and the food. The downside was that it was often windy in the afternoon. Maybe better to go there on a later date
251,Clean n crisp,"We’be been there to see how this world famous place looks like and we’ve been really disappointed.Too much people, McDonalds and other fast foods everywhere... If you want something more juste go à but southern to Miami, Burleigh heads or tallebudgera."
252,Lovely,What a postcard perfect beach ..Endless Golden Clean Sunny..what else someone would want...excellent both in the day as well as at night...there are lots of life guards on duty..
253,Lovely,The sand is fine-grained white sand - clean and soft under-foot. Thr shops are only a metres away if you get hungry. And there's plenty of life guards.
254,"A MUST DO WHEN VISITING THE FAMOUS GOLD COAST -  "" THE ESPLANADE ""","It's a lovely beach anyway for sure, however I was there at christmas so I was lucky to be there for the carols on the beach event which was epic! But the views out to sea and back to surfers from anywhere on the beach is lovely. & they have the beach markets of course. Whats not to love?"
255,Leisure,It reminds me of San Remo or Mornington by all its endless sands & openness.The Esplanade is a very nice stroll night or day.Be on the Look out for the Night Markets.  Good stuff there.
256,"A Broad, Flat Ocean Beach","A few days after ANZAC day we went to Surfers Paradise and took a walk along the beach. It’s just such a chilled place, people enjoying the sunshine and the water, surfers trying to catch a wave and children building sand castles. We stopped to look at the ANZAC memorial and the recently placed wreaths.The day we were there they were setting up the evening market on the prom.I was only there for the day but was eyeing up the apartments for future holiday let’s! There looked to be plenty of them."
257,Beautiful beach!,"You are unlikely to be able to find a better beach anywhere!  There is plenty of room so that you are not on top of other people, plenty of lifeguards and a beautiful mix of golden sand and turquoise sea.  What more could you want?!"
258,Still worth a visit,"Having visited several beaches in different countries, I did not had any anxiety and planned only one day for Gold Coast.But when I entered the beaches of Gold Coast, I found the same amazing.The cleanliness and the white sand was inviting you to spend hours.An unforgettable experience, which I will cherish for ever."
259,One of the best beaches in the world!,I would like to say how wonderful the area has become and that many improvements have been made to the beach... boardwalk is great to walk along!
260,Iconic beach ,"Surfers Paradise Beach is one of many iconic beaches on the Gold Coast famously known around the world, it is very popular with tourists, hence it is busy from sunrise and into the wee hours of the morning.  In the afternoon the beach becomes heavily shaded from the neighbouring high-rise buildings, depending on what experience you want at the beach you need to time your visit.  The beach is patrolled."
261,Visit,Surfers is a bit of a dump! Let’s face it. The beach however is a great opportunity to walk and enjoy some time by the sea. Great to get out of the hotel and wander on this iconic beach.. and get away from surfers to the more appealing Broadbeach
262,Great Beach,"a great place for a stopover, a comfortable place in the city center close to the place of business that I visited, and thank you to the restaurant staff who always serve friendly and the food is delicious"
263,Beautiful place,Had stayed at marriot . 200 mtrs from the beach. Beach had soft cold gushy sand. But to my dissapointment it was not a clean water beach. Not many activities also.
264,So busy! ,"Surfers Paradise beach was just lovely. Exactly what I thought it would be. As you walk straight of Cavil Ave onto the beach, there is plenty of places to eat close by and you can hire scooters and pushbikes if you wanted to be a bit more active. Lovely time."
265,Great beach,Was a epic day we were there but the traffic was terrible and the people were rude and not very friendly. Lots of development still going on. I’d prefer quieter areas next time.
266,"Super beach, great place","Location on the Gold Coast meets all our needs,Broadbeach location near beach,next to Tram service,close to Casino,and near to Pacific Fair"
267,It is really a paradise for the surfers,"I've been to a number of beaches around the world, and this is one of the most beautiful. I like when beaches are cared for by the city, and it was obvious that this clean beautiful beach is diligently cleaned/sifted. The incredible skyline on the beach adds to the uniqueness, and there is so much to do. I only discovered this beautiful area of Australia because friends invited me to a conference. I didn't know much about the Gold Coast. Wow!"
268,Stunning view,"I dont think there are to many stretches of beach anywhere in the world that are as pretty and maintained as perfectly as this one.Easy walking on a level surface make this a excellent pastime along the forshore, whether it be a daytime walk or a romantic stroll after dinner. Easy to get to, and safe."
269,Not even remotely a paradise,"Ok it's beautiful, the whole Gold Coast is lovely. However my one bugbear is all the tall buildings that have been built right next to the water front. Whilst it's great for the millionaire owners, those of us who just want to enjoy the beach struggle to get any direct sunlight in the afternoon as the tall buildings shield most of it.So if you want a beach to be a bit chilly and a bit dark, go in the afternoon."
270,Perfect spot,"We first went to meet around and ended up going the next day to take the little one to the beach, the beach is clean, lifeguards are nearby making sure everyone is safe, toilet was surprisingly clean, showers are nearby as well as locker services. What we liked the most was that we were just a few meters away from the shopping area so you can have fun indoors while the sun is too hot"
271,Beautiful beach,The waves can be a bit choppy with swells and back wash a good proportion of the time but the setting is great. The sand is clean and the seawater is clean. Easy to get to and there is ample parking in the vicinity
272,Souless Paradise,Tried to make the most of the beach while on holidays even though the weather wasn’t playing the game. Still had heaps of fun and found plenty of lifeguards on duty creating a relaxed experience where everyone appeared to enjoy themselves.
273,Had to be seen,I am not a person who generally wanders the beaches....but on this day a beautiful day I walked for about 3 hours up and down the beach! A funtastic experience
274,Clean and perfect,"There's nothing I look forward to more than coming on holiday and going to Surfers Paradise Beach. The Skyline views from anywhere you sit, the crystal blue water and the golden sands, it's picture perfect. Lifeguards are everywhere for your safety and there's so much room. Can literally come here any time of day and the water is perfect to swim in. Love it."
275,Most Popular Beach For The Youth,"The city is massive and there is lots of shopping, food, and clubs to enjoy. It is not exactly my cup of tea but going out to the national parks was definitely worth the trip."
276,Beautiful Beach,"Catherine at The Hilton Surfers Paradise is the most friendly and warm person in Surfers Paradise.  Every morning at breakfast we were greeted with a beautiful, genuine smile and nothing was too much trouble for her. She is fast and efficient and so welcoming!"
277,This beach is amazing!,"The Gold Coast City Council should be ashamed. We stayed a few days and were sad to see how seedy and run down central Surfers Paradise has become. However if you want to immerse yourself in Asian culture, along with many restaurants and businesses catering to this demographic then it is just like visiting Beijing - but without the crowds.  Head further south for better hotels, shopping and restaurants."
278,A day on Surfers Paradise Beach,"Regardless of the conditions, this is one of the best beaches I have ever traveled to. Not only is the sand pristine but the water is always warm, there's waves most of the time, plenty of life guards patrolling and the views are first class. The kind of place you could easily spend a full day enjoying."
279,Beautiful Beach,Must do to say you have been there but was rough everyday we were here so unless you are a strong swimmer would not recommend going in the water
280,"Christmas on the beach, what?!",Great views from the 77 floor.But is way to expensive for what you get when  you get up there.Then they expect you to pay $2 to look through there binoculars what a tipp off.We had lunch up there and that was just ok.ordered trip of dips and came out with  only 2 dips and  bread trio in my day was 3.Went back  to ask for 3rd dip and she said  it's only oil and balsamic. Well don't sell me a trio next time.Sorry way to expensive at  $27 per adult even though it is a great  view.
281,A beautiful and relax beach,One of the most happening bachfron of Goldcoast. Has a lot of streetshops and provides a nice and beautiful walk.
282,Lovely beaches!,"This is what us poms think of when you mention aussie beaches,and we weren't disappointed, mile after mile of sand,spent several hours just watching the world go by.Got up early one morning to watch the sunrise,hard to put into words the view"
283,One of the finest of beaches,"Escaping winter back home, arrived to perfect ""winter"" in the Surfers Paradise.""What winter?""Much to see and lots of eat. Transport to both the other ends easily available. Tram and buses.Also note there is a free shuttle bus for tourists to the Harbour Town Outlet but u need to book online.  And should u decide to continue to Brisbane, several bus companies available for the 1 hour trip."
284,Lots of rips,"This is part of the long stretch of beaches along the Gold Coast. Apart from a small strip of parkland, high rise buildings are built right up to the beach. There is lots of sand, surf and the odd life guard tower, with lots of tourist taking selfies. It is just one long beach with no character … everything seemed sterilised. It is unnaturally lit very brightly at night. Don't even think of spotting any nocturnal wildlife. There are better beaches than Surfers, or most of the beaches in the Gold Coast for that matter."
285,Beautiful beach,"What can I say,  Gold Coast has some of the most amazing beaches in the world. They also can be dangerous so swim in between the flags.The night life has fine dining,  Entertainment,  Casino shopping,  Gorgeous bars and cafes for breakfast. Also heaps of resorts to choose between which go on budget and taste."
286,Great place,Had a maccas breakfast It was okOnly very few people around Birds came while we were eatingNice scenery relaxing b4 we had to fly home!!!!!
287,Surf & Coffee,Went to Surfer's Paradise for a surprise birthday party. We had a couple of nights to ourselves where we did some shopping and got something to eat at Charlie's. Food was great as was the whole experience on Cavil and the beach. Would do it again.
288,Awesome ,"I  live in the eastern suburbs of sydney, and i had forgotten how much warmer the water is up here. It is well patrolled and the weather is so good . Better  than hawaii."
289,Surfers Paradise Live 2019,February was really quiet......but fabulous! The sand sculpture championships were on and fantastic!Great to walk hand in hand for miles in Luke warm waters...divine!
290,Great place,"My last visit to Goldcoast it was more than 22 years ago. Now its has more high rise building, more hotel, and the tram.As the centre of the tourism, Surfers Paradise beach is always the main spot. We do love it so much, its still clean and in a good condition. The white sand is so awesome. My cons: is now we see more homeless man at the front off some shop with they belonging"
291,Must visit even if you are a traveller from other country or state,... having a nice and safe time.  It's a good thing they are welcomed and looked after so well.  It's a part of growing up!  YMMV
292,2nd home away from home.,"I had not been to Surfers Paradise for a number of years until recently because it had got quite dowdy and run down and did not have the best reputation locally. However, things have changed and the council really looks like it has invested and improved things a lot since I last saw it. There is a beautiful long esplanade to walk along the beach. We did a 5km walk from Surfers Paradise to Broadbeach and you can walk along the beachfront for about 80% of this distance. The beach itself is beautiful and clean. At sunrise you will fine a lot of people out walking along the beach. It is patrolled with life guards and there are plenty of toilets and shower facilities along the front, close to the beach. It is a really excellent spot now."
293,Autumn walk along the beach,We returned after a 6 year gap and the place has certainly grown. Not as good as our previous visit but still a fabulous place. The beach is amazing and there are plenty of places to eat and shop
294,Surfers Paradise,"It’s been our go to place for 5 years twice a year. That’s until myself, wife were assulted in front of our children. CCTV footage captured the entire event. Local police were no help and we were told no charges will be laid. Obviously trying to keep the crime stats down. We’ll be looking for a safer holiday destination."
295,Iconic Beach,Just simple and stunning. So clean and well maintained. Doesn't matter your age it's just beautiful and clean
296,Beautiful Beach,But better at Broadbeach and a much nicer atmosphere there too. If you have kids then I would strongly suggest stating outside of central Surfers and just do a day visit there
297,Nice,"We come here for holiday.  Haven't been here since Xmas 2010It changed a bit, but still has that long & beautiful white sand beach It looks so beautiful, especially in the morning when sun rise The 3 nights a week night market is awesome. Great experience for people whom like craft or some thing cool Always live to visiting this area"
298,Popular beach point ,"I have lost count of how many times I’ve been here and I keep coming back for more, the endless golden sand, the waves and the atmosphere ❤️❤️❤️"
299,Great family fun ,"Nenavstivit Sufers Paradise ked ste na Goldcoaste by bol hriech. Jeho typicka atmosfera, paradna beach walk je must be co treba vidiet. Mnozstvo obchodikov a restauracii, vsetko walking distance."
