1,So Much To See and Just Beautiful ,"I use this word too much but WOW, breathtaking, inspirational, magic, magnificent...etc Such care and detail has gone into the preservation of original  architecture and styles of the  period.DO NOT miss this area of Savannah!"
2,Gorgeous ,"Just beautiful.. so much history. The architecture and the squares, breathtaking. So much to see. I definitely recommend a trolley tour learning about the history."
3,A MUST,"Beautiful, historic, walkable, enchanting gardens on the squares. We came in February 2019, and everything was in bloom. Walked this over two two days with kids 9 and 13, moved the car a few times. We did an overview of highlights on day one, then day two I let the kids pick where to go. We learned a lot! We put on several miles walking. I recommend finding a place to pay to park (it’s only $1-2). Be careful where the cobblestone pops up from tree roots; my son managed to trip. I would like to come back with my husband for a long weekend."
4,Amazing For Historic Learning and the Beauty of the City!,Charming and historic but vibrant and full of life. A must city to visit if you are in Georgia. There's always something to do. Worth exploring!
5,Very peaceful tour,It’s easy to walk all 22 squares in the Historic District and well worth doing so.  Simply stunning.  Hop off the Old Town Trolley tour and walk around if you are not staying here
6,Tour of historic Savannah ,"Fun and easy to walk through the district...the squares are lush, gorgeous and have historic markers an statues to see."
7,Savannah historic tour and steamboat ,"If you love history and architecture, this is for you. Beautifully laid out and maintained; many photographic spots and places to sit in the shade."
8,Savannah Stroll!,"Beautiful, clean, serene...We stayed across the street from the fountain. The best spot ever! We loved the area and ease of movement in the area. A Kroger to stock our apt fridge, Betty Bombers to eat, a great place to exercise. The best place I ever enjoyed “living” at in a new city for 4 days!"
9,Shop till ya drop!,"This property lacks nothing. Location is perfect.  Staff is the best ever.  It’s well built, quiet, classy, comfortable, fun.  You just can’t go wrong."
10,Beautiful ,"Savannah is beautiful, is easy to navigate, and just exudes history. A must see southern city! Don’t miss All the statues, the parks, and all the delicious food."
11,Don’t miss Savannah! ,"Savannah’s Historic District is quiet, so very pedestrian friendly, and loaded with history.  The small squares are lovely with statues and monuments and checking them out is an easy way to learn a lot of history from colonial times through the Civil War.  All have benches and the live oaks dripping with Spanish moss provide shade if needed.  Easy to spend a lot of time here just wandering and reading the plaques."
12,So convenient and informative ,"Loved the beauty of Savannah, it's history and it's lovely squares.  Many people walking (with or without pets), all seem happy."
13,Savannah is a Gem!,Beautiful area to peruse and see all the iconic sites and sounds.  The buildings and the trees are surreal and it brings you back to the old days and how life used to be lived.  Very quaint and special and worth the trip if you are ever in the south.
14,Nice State but not very nice with drivers,This town is beautiful in landscape and architecture. Had a lot of history. The hop on hop off was beneficial in seeing a lot of the town. Excellent restaurants.
15,Great historic houses.,"It's 2.5 square miles of awesome architecture, 22+ beautiful park squares, moss-hung tree-shaded streets, monuments, history brass plaques, inns, bars, restaurants, shopping, and people-watching. Though very walkable or bikeable, the tour company buses cover the entire area with excellent, completely informative live guides. Horse-drawn carriage rides are popular. Many feature films have used the area landmarks as unique and unforgettable backdrops. The natives are friendly, and the business managers are welcoming and helpful. You can see it all in a day, but you could spend years getting to know it."
16,What a quaint city!,"I love this city.  Walking around this area was wonderfu--the architecture, the climate, the moss on the trees. We were there on a day when not all businesses were open (New Year's).  I would've liked to see some of the antique shops and restaurants.  I love every square foot of it."
17,Beautiful area,"Historic southern city with lots of history, charm, great restaurants, and ghosts! Beautiful historic homes and relaxing squares or upscale hotels and unique restaurants on River St make Savannah a vacation destination for a weekend or longer! This is one of my favor cities in the US."
18,Great visit to an awesome city,"Fascinating place. I could live here. The Squares were charming and beautiful. Took several tours, including the Hop On, Hop Off which was a good introduction to much the city had to offer. The Shrimp and Grits at the Public House were inspirational."

20,The Historic District is why we moved to Savannah.,"Walking the streets of Savannah is a trip through history, so many amazing houses, churches and museums, so many delightful squares and parks. So much food and drink. Do the bus tour, then take a walk around. Pop into the small restaurants, the local businesses, take in the sights, sounds and smells of Svannah."
21,Vacation with my Bride,"Amazing historic district, very nice people, I recommend this for families, kids, parents, and pretty much every one who is interested in history, plus it has a river by it so you can go out on boat tours, to the beach, and North Carolina is right next to it, so if you haven't been there, it's a bridge away from Savannah, Ga!"
22,Interesting area and very walkable ,Just a terrific walking tour of this beautiful area. So much history here and presented so intriguingly.
23,Very enjoyable visit,"The most beautiful and historic cities! This is a must visit while in Savannah... If you can get a hotel in the district, you'd be doing yourself a favor! Walking on the historic roads were very enchanting... My favorite place to visit..."

So glad we came, thank you Savannah Historic district, you were a walk through time that we all absolutely enjoyed."
25,Great Walking town!!,Great for walking. Interesting of all squares and what is around it. Lots of revolutionary history and civil war history. If you drive you will pay to park everywhere. Take the shuttle or park at a central location.
26,Beautiful!,The architecture of old Savannah is stunning. Spent 2 days just walking through the squares and streets. Fantastic!
27,Beautiful walk in history,The historic district is just beautiful.  The houses and parks are gorgeous to admire and visit. BUT! When sun sets stay away from the parks and the streets. Drunks and bums are common on all the benches in several of the parks. Young and aggressive men roam the area and can scare the s... out of you.  We were just too old to enjoy this. A shame!
28,You will fall in love with Savannah!,"Built around ""squares;"" beautiful parks, really, with ancient oaks and spectacular fountains/statues, Savannah is really a must-see.  By all means, take the trolley tour (we prefer the white one - Old Savannah Trolley Tours) and save steps and parking hassles.  The narrated tours are well worth the money, and you can hop on/hop off at any of 15+ stops.  The churches and historic homes are everywhere, and each has a story.  Stay in the historic district if you can afford a splurge, but you should visit Savannah.  The people are very friendly and polite, and Southern charm prevails.  Oh, and the FOOD!"
29,Beautiful historic architecture and lots to do,"Check it out!  Savannah’s Historic District is great for all kinds of travelers!....Business, Family, Friends....There is plenty to see and do!  Take a walk down Jones Street to see the stately homes.  Check out all the squares.  Stay in a B&B to enjoy some Southern hospitality!  Relax on a Hop-on-Hop Off tour to truly understand the rich history of the area.  Go for a meal at The Olde Pink House.  Tour the Telfair museums.  Shop, eat and sightsee or party with friends on River Street or City Market.  In my opinion, save your money and skip the ghost tours!Whatever your fancy, you’ll find it in Savannah!  Kick back and enjoy!"
30,Still beautiful ,Just walking around all the squares gives you a feeling of being in another time. Lovely! Architecture is fabulous.

38,Great Sites!,Charming and fantastic walking city!  Loved strolling and exploring the many squares.  It is truly picturesque and enjoyable.  Food in general is great.  Be sure to buy a parking pass from the city or possibly hotel.  The hotels closest to River Street charge an excessive daily amount....$35-40/night.  I bought a 2 day metered parking pass for $24.
39,Always a nice visit,"Savannah is known for its charm, architecture and ambiance. The historic district offers all this, lovely houses, moss draped trees, really nice parks. Easy walking and appeared safe and clean."

41,Beautiful Neighborhoods,beautiful historical town that is easy and lovely to walk while enjoying a crazy mixture of architecture
42,Great downtown historic district ,"Savannah is unique and beautiful.The historic area has limited parking so walking is best.Lots of restaurants and bars, Covid practices everywhere we saw.

49,The Best Part of our Visit,"The old houses in the Historic District were truly lovely to look at and staying at a lovely carriage house there, I could walk in any direction and see these lovely old houses as they were and as they are. Even walks at night were quite peaceful, except for when passing by the old Colonial Cemetery. It was quite creepy, which I found quite interesting. Yes, there are ghosts about, but not the Hollywood type."
50,Vacation,"Great place to visit, Australians would love the history and nightlife, American culture at its best"

The trees are absolutely magnificent.
67,Strolling through the squares,"Savannah is one of the most delightful and friendly places on earth.  Very walkable city.  Tours available for every kind of interest.

76,Savannah Historic,"The area is lovely. The architecture that has been preserved is amazing. The iron work, the balconies and the stone work that has survived and become more charming with age. Enjoy Savannah on foot, in a horse drawn carriage, on a ped-i-cycle or on one of the Old Savannah Tours. It is a trip worth taking."
77,A great walking city,Beautiful city. We took the hop on hop off tour with Old Savannah tours. Loved the characters that entertained us!
78,Short-time visit,We stayed for only one night - what a fabulous city!  The people and history made it a must return location.
79,Oriordant,The Historic District is the most important feature of Savannah and the most interesting.  I don't think there is any other reason to visit there unless you explore the historic district and the culinary adventures there.
80,Amazing walkability! ,We walked though out the historic district and throughly enjoyed it. The live oak trees and the buildings and architecture are amazing.
81,Amazing well kept classic houses,Lovely area. The streets are beautifully lined with canopied trees and it’s almost as every block you cross there’s another park

83,Great Walkiing City,"Savannah is totally unique full of character and characters. They have a Halloween for dogs, would you believe? Called Waggaween and involves hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes dressed in fancy dress...I kid you not! 😂 The streets are amongst the prettiest I’ve ever seen anywhere in the world and Monterey Square is worth a visit just on its own. Great choice of eateries - our favourite being The Public"
84,I love Savannah!,Was everything I had hoped for and more! Hope to return sometime.  So much History and seems every house had a story. Our Trolley guide gave us so much information and then we returned to just walk around and take pictures.

90,Must see!  Antebellum south in all its glory!,"I lived on the west coast for the major of my 70 years, but, I always love visiting the Historic South with the great food and southern hospitality. Savannah’s historic district has beautiful homes, restaurants, parks/squares, monuments and so many other things to see. Every where you go people hold doors open for you and smile and say hello! I don’t even think they realize it as it is just part of their friendly nature. I highly recommend taking one of the narrated trollies to visit the historic sites and to hear the stories of the south. The historic area is very walkable, but the humidity might make riding more palatable. Charleston, South Carolina is another wonderful place you might enjoy!"
91,Beautifully Preserved,Beautiful & charming city. Have a great time visiting the historic district and some of the trolley stops.
92,Charming Southern Atmosphere,"Savannah's Historic district is our favorite vacation destination of any place we have been in the world.  The parks, historic buildings, riverfront and scenery are spectacular but the real treasure is the hospitality and genuine friendliness of everyone in Savannah.  There are so many great places to eat that we have trouble fitting every place we want to go into the time we are here. We hope to eventually spend part of our retirement in Savannah!"
93,A lor of history,We enjoyed walking the squares. They are all so well kept and beautiful. The people are so friendly. We didn’t do the museums as they are not kid friendly.
94,Stay in the District,"We had no idea how wonderful Savannah's old, historic homes and buildings could be.  And the great joy: many of them are accessible as they now double as museums, Inn's, businesses, or part of the fabulous Savannah College of Art and Design.  We will go back to Savannah for a vacation trip to see more of these marvelous structures."
95,charming,Savannah is a beautiful city. I was very surprised that is not worldwide known.  Probably one of the most beautiful cities in the US.
96,Fun place  and a great walk,"Historic ain't a misnomer.  Architecture, history, parks, squares, statues, museums, film locations, Revolutionary and Civil War monuments and cemeteries. historical markers, well maintained and authentic famed residences and buildings.  More to see than you shake a stick at.  Clean, safe, many easy ways to get around, great food everywhere.  Truly a special place and not too touristy.  Spend a day or week or two. Well worth a visit."
97,Incredible Place,This is where you want to stay when you come to town. Be downtown by the river walk... This is a beautiful place and many sites to see along the architecture of the city and the trees! OMG
98,Beautiful Walking City,I loved Savannah! Beautiful.  Historical. So much to see! Take the trolley tour. We learned so much more
99,Very walkable,"Just strolling around and see this beautiful houses, shaded places and cute balconies where worth a walk. Also recommend walking along Jones Street."
100,Beautiful and easy to navigate,"I admit that I didn't have high expectations for this place, but only because I live in a similar tourist trap and figured it wouldn't impress me.  I only had one full day to spend here, but I already have plans to go back!  One day isn't enough--there's too many streets to wander and too many pretty trees to take pictures of....pictures just don't cut it though.  You have to BE there."
101,So interesting and beautiful grace!,There is so much to see and do in Savannah that even though I avoided buses boats and tours because of the coronavirus I filled Saint Paddy’s day with fun things to do!
102,A beautiful city,Beautiful place to visit.  Do a tour so you can get   The history.  Lots to do and visit.  Still some cobblestone streets!
103,"Amazing homes, Savannah Seafood Shack","Very quaint city filled with tons of history, shops and restraurants. We stayed at the Holiday Inn right on the edge of the historic district very close to City Market. The only drawback was our bathroom lacked an outlet! We bought a trolley pass which was a great way to see the attractions of the district in 1 1/2 hours. The driver truly makes the ride either pleasurable or kind of boring. Kathleen was fabulous. The city is very walkable if you have the time and the ambition. Highly recommend skipping the ghost tours unless you are just interested in old houses. The tours were very hokey. Huey's along the river was a great place to eat. Pinky's was a local dive bar that was fun to visit and get a taste of the locals and a tasty old fashioned. All the people were super friendly. Highly recommend a visit."
104,Family Get-together,"Savanah’s historic district is a place you will absolutely fall in love with. This city has so much to offer and so much history that comes along with it. There are tons of coffee shops, restaurants, and mini parks all around. Even if you only have a couple hours to spend definitely try to stop by if you can! Would highly recommend for a friends trip or even a couples retreat!"
105,Explore the Squares,Beautiful homes and trees - super scenery that you will want to save in photos!  You can make memories in Savannah!
106,BEAUTIFUL BUT.......,"This is my third visit to this lovely city and I learn something new each time I come.   The historic district is full of culture, beauty, and history.  You can walk down any street in the historic district and appreciate the architecture and the gardens.  Around each corner is a gem.   The house museums are spectacular.    Enjoy"
107,The prettiest city.,"Very informative with lots of signage. Buildings are beautiful. Can be walked easily, lots of benches in each square for a sit down if you need it."
108,Love Historic Savannah ,"Loved the city- going back. The antebellum homes, the feel, the streets and gigantic old trees— the horse and carriage tours -I could almost see Rhett Butler and Scarlet strolling along- with her parasol of course."
109,Just a few tips for you when viewing the area,"Savannah historical district was fantastic. Yopu need a week to see everything. It was way more entertaining then we imagined. Not sure it would be fun for little kids, but for history and food and bars and ghosts, ti was great!  Very fun for an adventurous couple. Very walkable like London!"
110,STUNNING ,Savannah is just beautiful.  You can't visit without touring the historic district.  Jones street is one of the prettiest.  You can take a hop-on/hop-off trolley if you tire from walking.
111,Where are the beautiful homes?,"We had a great visit, except for hotel. We love Savannah and all it offers. Our 15yr old enjoys the history and all there is to see."
112,"Huge, Charming, and Walkable","With 22 squares to visit, innumerable wonderful places to dine, and picture perfect weather, the Historic District is a treat!"
113,Savannah the beautiful ,Loved this area and what Savannah has to offer for families with teenagers. We had so much fun. Stayed at Doubletree. Great hotel

117,"Lovely, charming walkable area!","Very interesting area to explore, especially on foot or bicycle. Unique street layout with squares at intersections. Each square is unique with gardens and historical monuments and surrounded by colonial era architecture. Lots of good restaurants in area and picturesque riverfront nearby."
118,Beautiful and interesting,"I loved learning about the history of Savannah, seeing the buildings, homes art and everything else that comes with it. There are over 400 places to eat in the city, so you won't go hungry, just bring enough money for everything!"
119,10 Days on the IOP & Charleston (Wild Dunes Resort),"I live on Isle of Hope 8 miles from the 1 mile square which is the heart if Historic Savannah. Every single street, square, home, shop, restaurant or event is ready and waiting for your visit. The Hostess City invites you to spend a day or a week visiting, celebrating, getting married or attending food fests, film fests, garden tours and learning about history, art and culture. In my two years here I have never been bored, never run out of options or events and every single step offers a photo op. This is a place to getaway whether your travelling 8 or 8000 miles!"
120,Great architecture!,"I loved the food, the weather, the beach, the airport, learning about the town, and did I mention the FOOD!!. The fish is fresh and clean, lived it. The food was well seasoned every where we went. Oh Savannah, don't you cry for me, Im looking forward to coming back, no banjo on my knee. :D"
121,Great trip!,"Nice historic district, many historic buildings, many squares with history, many shops and restaurants, nice river."
122,Beautiful ,"This is a beautiful city that is a must see. We took the Hop on Hop Off Bus Tour which is a nice guided tour throughout the city. You can get off at any of the many stops, shop, get something to eat, walk around and then get back on the next bus. My previous time on this tour two years ago had actors as various characters from Savannah history come onto the bus to tell a brief story about themselves. This time, that feature wasn't available, I suppose was do to COVID19. It was still quite enjoyable and I would definitely do it again."
123,Canadian Getaway,"I always presumed that Savannah was rich in history, but I was amazed.  the buildings, the early families, the layout of the town squares...You could spend two or three days just taking in the history of the town squares and the people who built them.  There are places along the Eastern seaboard that have a deep history, but Savannah has maintained most of the squares, buildings, and stories that built the town."
124,"Read the ""Book""","The historic district is a very walkable area, full of history, with lots of good restaurants, pubs, shopping, and sites to see. It is a lot like Charleston and New Orleans. Most of the restaurants are down by the river. The Dot is the city bus system for the area and is free and available up until midnight. The city market area has lots of little unique shops and live music. The River Street area, Colonial Park cemetery, Public Squares, old houses, and statues are all within walkable distance, though a lot of cobblestone areas could be difficult for some folks. The people are friendly and seems to be things to do and tours still going on until late at night. A very family friendly and lively area of town."
125,Get-away in Savannah!!!,"We cannot say enough about Historic Savannah! This area is, by far, one of our family’s favorite. With the Riverwalk, City Market, mossy trees, old heritage- we are in love!"
126,Amazing Place to Visit,It was so easy to navigate this beautiful area. So much history and lots of plaques to explain the history.
127,Trolling Around ,"For more than 30 years I have wanted to visit Savannah, or more to the point, it’s historic downtown/district. The places were history took place, the buildings where people lived and worked, the places we see in movies, and the places where we can enjoy this Southern charm and hospitality. Just before Christmas we finally took our trip,  and Savannah lived up to everything I ever dreamed of and more. I’ve already reviewed a range of places we enjoyed, discovered, and had to see. But overall, I think what I take away is that Savannah did indeed turn out to be everything I’d wanted. I’ve traveled widely across the US, UK, and Europe with a range of outcomes and levels of enjoyment. Places often don’t fully live up to our expectations. But when they do it’s a warm and welcome surprise, that you can come away feeling even better than you’d imaged. This is a charming area, a historic district reflecting each generation and decade of change. Savannah’s past included enslaved people and the civil war, river commerce and southern hospitality, but also, as time passed, updating and some who wanted to tear down the past. That led to some who worked to save her, such as Jim Williams, known to most from The Book and film, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Where Williams left off, SCAD, the Savannah College of Art and Design, picked up. Today’s Savannah and its historic district reflect this range of time, people, and events. You can walk in the footsteps of many, reflect on their lives and consider your own. From the squares where you can sit and talk to new friends or old, read, or watch the day pass by, to the historic architecture, its beauty and significance. From the ghosts who haunt most every building to the real people who are buried here. From the tours to the food to the shopping... Savannah offers something for everyone. There is much to do here. Great food. Fun tours. Interesting history. Tales and legend and lore. Some things are true. Some things are not. Since returning from Savannah we’ve talked to dozens of others and the reactions are always one of two: 1. I’ve always wanted to go and 2. We love it there.So for those who’ve always wanted to go... what’s stopping you? Go! And for those who’ve gone and love it... perhaps it’s time to go back... We will as soon as we can..."
128,L❤️ve ,The historic district of Savannah is about 1 mile by 1 mile with lots of trendy shops and fun pubs and restaurants.  Live music is performed in certain areas.  Lots to see and do.
129,Delightful Walking,"What can I say about Savannah, Georgia's historic district that hasn't been said before? Probably not much, but I will try. There is a spirit that wraps itself around you as you walk into the historic district. The buildings, lush vegetation, beautiful trees, beautiful old buildings and, of course, the many squares with their varying histories and landscaping. I loved the squares. Then there are the cool little shops and great little bars and restaurants. I could have spent more time and desperately want to go back. Plus I took a ghost walk in the evening, the first one I've ever been on. It was great fun even though I never spotted a ghost. When I was there the movie Gemini Man was being filmed, so I got to see some of the action, which just added to the fun. I also took the trolley tour, which was great, since you could get off where you wanted and then catch another trolley to continue on. At various stops, Savannah characters stepped onto the bus and gave us their history. What else can someone ask for in a five-day stay in an area? And the pecan pralines, oh, the most delicious candy I've ever tasted. I definitely will get back to Savannah some day."
130,This is a must do,Savannah should be justifiably proud of this district. What a delight to visit. We loved the architecture and the green spaces in the Squares!
131,What a beautiful city - and the people....,So many beautiful building and parks!  Be sure to stop by the visitor center for suggestions.  Enjoyed the Water Taxi to get a little brake from walking.
132,Very scenic city,I have visited many historic districts in this country but Savannah is definitely on the top of the list. I recommend to use the trolley or just walk the streets and squares. There is history everywhere. Take a tour of some of the historic houses. Even a ghost tour can be fun. I never get bored of it.
133,Wonderful vacation!,"Love this town so much. It’s so charming and I love how Savannah works hard to preserve the history behind every home, business and the city itself. We did our first tour ever as a family and loved it! (That’s saying a lot for teenagers!)"
134,A Walk to Remember,I used the Old Savannah Hop On/Off trolley to see the majority of the beautiful old homes and Square in the historic district. It is just so beautiful.
135,Beautiful place,"Savannah has always been and continues to be one of my favorite cities. Because it has laid out in squares, it is very easy to navigate. The welcome center can provide great maps as well as suggestions for what to do. Especially nice on Sunday when river front parking is free."
136,Southern beauty,"Savannah’s historic area is so full of interesting history. You can never get enough. The Best way to get around is to do the hop on and hop off bus. You’ll get history and information about what to do the rest of your time there. Lovely historic mansions are everywhere as well as 20 different squares many of which are surrounded by churches, museums and enchanting inns. There is so much to see in this district so take the time to see absorb the beauty that Savannah has to offer."
137,Beautiful Historic City with fine Southern Hospitality!,What a nice afternoon strolling around the historic district in Savannah. The buildings are wonderfully maintained and visiting the little squares this is really a wonderful little town. They have the hop on and off buses but the town is small enough you can easily walk it if you want.
138,Vacation ,"Lovely homes, shops, restaurants, and of course the famous squares of Savannah. Take your time and just explore."
139,Amazing!,Loved this area! So glad it survived the war!  It’s small enough that it’s pretty difficult to get lost and make sure you go through the parks!
140,Girl's Trip,Beautiful architecture and tons to do. Definitely take a walk down Bull street. If you start by the river and work your way towards Forsyth Park you will do through most of the city squares. There are several cute shops and restaurants along the way. Very pretty walk!
141,Breathtaking architecture and walking cocktails,"Great area.Had a great time.seeing and learning about Savannah.Worth taking the time out to see the history, really cool."
142,Great place for a leisurely walk,Beautiful homes still decorated for Christmas. I probably took 100 photos at least. Many we’re having construction repairs but so many more were so pretty making you want to go inside.
143,THIS is the Old Southern Charm place!,One of the nicest cities we've ever had the opportunity to visit. The beautiful historic district is overwhelming. Some of the best restaurants in the world are located in Savannah.
144,Take the tour!,"If you're looking for the old south this is it. Iron railings, trees that croos overhead as you look down the street(Jones St.) squares with green spaces - its all here!"
145,Beautiful,"It was so nice to be able to walk through all of the historic district and see all the squares, the churches, the beautiful homes and the shops and restaurants. There is so much history there."
146,Amazing Area,"I live in Savannah, but never fail to be stunned by the beauty of the Historic District. It’s something that everyone should see at least once in their lives. If you can, stay in one of the hotels/ B&B there. However, Savannah is a great walking city, with many inexpensive ways to travel from anywhere downtown."
147,One of my favorite vacations.,"We spent two days wandering through the historic district on foot, it was a beautiful experience. I love the squares, the houses surrounding them are so majestic, we managed to see 16 of them. The landscaping is so beautiful, especially with the big trees with the Spanish moss hanging off of them. We wandered into some of the shops, everyone was so welcoming and friendly. Savannah is one of my favorite cities and I am so glad that we came back for another visit."
148,One of my favorite cities ,"We took a motorized tour of the district with Grey Lines, learned a lot of histroy and enjoyed the beautiful parks."
149,Take your camera!,"Walking through the beautiful squares, it's easy to picture yourself strolling around on an evening greeting the previous generations cooling off on the veranda with an iced tea. So much to take in, it can be difficult to decide what to see. I always recommend an Old Town Trolley tour to get an overview and decide what to go see, but you can't beat just walking the squares taking in the homes, parks, churches and cemeteries."
150,beautiful old homes in a classic neighborhood,"Savannah certainly has many things, but history is the one that really stands out. The amount of dazzling architecture seen in this area surpasses most places by far! A must-see and visit!"
151,Beautiful place to explore,"Put on your sneakers and get busy walking this beautiful city. Take in all the flowers, live oaks covered in Spanish moss, the architecture and the squares. You can easily get 15,000 steps per day while seeing all there is to see."
152,Winter getaway ,"Recommend “detours” private tour of historic Savannah (available through TripAdvisor).  Chris was a fabulous, knowledgeable guide. We learned a lot about the history of Savannah."
153,Beautiful City / Easy to stroll,We enjoyed walking the historic squares.  The city is easily walkable and laid out in grids.  Take the time to read the placards that detail all the events that have happened in the city.  They are significant in history.  I love how the areas have shade trees lining the streets and parks.
154,One of America's Outstanding Cities,"We enjoyed our weekend in Savannah. Learned about the pre revolution era to about 1850. Religion, culture, and international diplomacy are all part of Savannah's past as is movies, arts and southern hospitality is a part of its present. Savannh is a nice get away."
155,Beautiful,Very historic city.  Make sure to take some type of tour (there are many) to gain more insight and know which areas you’d like to visit again.  We took the Savannah Old Town on and off trolley.  Enjoyed walking the historic river street.
156,Beautiful Old Town,"Manicured lawns, distinguished architecture, only thing missing is a mint julep. Savannah is the perfect place to enjoy the culture, food and see the historic homes. Lots to do!"
157,Amazing experience,"The house pictured is called ""The Gingerbread House"" and it's directly across the the main branch of Savannah Public Library; But it's not even really in the historic district. To tour the highlights of the district, I'd start at Forsyth Park and head north on Bull Street. You'll pass The Mercer House (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil), the house Sherman occupied during his encampment, and others as you make your way through the squares and will end up on Bay Street which leads down to River Street."
158,Great!,went for 3 hour walk down King street all the way to water front and up Rainbow Row.Amazing old houses.Took about a hundred pics.well worth the walk to see this classioc district.Can also take a horse drawn carridge on a guided tour.
159,My favorite city in US!,"Loved the squares, old homes and iron work. Some areas felt a little worn, but the true southern charm of htis area comes through.....with a little hint of ""spirit"" in the air. Lots of restaurants too. Easy walking."
160,Quaint / Historic ,"The best way to explore the district is by foot. The lanes , the ghost trees. the houses , the quayside all create an enjoyable atmosphere. Not to be missed if in Savannah"
161,Wonderful walking and Trolly Tours,I took a guided historic walking tour here and was so glad I did.  So many fascinating things to learn about this area and I would have missed so much if I hadn’t taken a tour.  The sad aspect was seeing so many homeless occupying every square that we visited.
162,Nothing quite like it,There is a ton of history in Savannah. There are many excellent walking tours as well as trolley and horse and carriage tours. Great place to visit and relax.
163,Love Savannah!,"Picked up a map at hotel that had significant landmarks delineated and pages with pictures of the sites. We basically passed through most of the squares, stopped at each and read through the details. I believe it was a guide of the trolley tours, but free and we got exercise."
164,Walking the historic district,"It was fun. Walked, ride the trolley, had coffee and ice cream. Wore layers because it was in November"
165,Wow!,"There is SO MUCH to see throughout Savannah's historic district.  There are a lot of historic markers and signs to help direct you.  After a few days of wandering around and reading signs on our own, we signed up for a walking tour with Savannah Walks, and they added even more to our understanding of the Historic District.  A visit here is definitely worth your time."
166,Beautiful ,"The Historic District is very tourist friendly. The entire area is flat (except for the steep drop to River St.) so it's easy to walk almost anywhere. If you are tired or have problems walking there are two free bus routes, one running in a north-south loop and the other in an east-west loop.  There are Historic and cultural sites all around. An additional plus for some people is that the city is very dog friendly My wife and I have visited twice and almost certainly will be back."
167,No one does Southern charm better than Savannah!,"Savannah is the easiet city to navigate and explore.  It was setup in the 1700's with a planned concept.  There are 24 different squares, all with slightly different theme.  All are beautifully landscaped with statues commemorating influential people in the life of Savannah.  All squares are a block apart and you can easily visit all 24 in one day.  Many restaurants and historic homes and buildings are along the route.  Plan on comfortable walking shoes ready to explore Savannah on foot as meant to."
168,Neat Squares,Stroll around and visit all the squares. Stop at various spots for a nice refreshing drink or an excellent eat.Savannah is a city to discover!
169,Such a beautiful city,Visited Savannah for a wedding and stayed in the historic district. Plenty of things to see and places to eat.
170,I Had No Idea,This was our first time in Georgia and I was at awe. I can't wait to go back again and wish we would of had more than 3 days. I love history and there is lots to see and learn in this area.
171,Savannah Culinary and Cultural walking Tour,"The historic district is one of the most walkable places that I have been.  We easily walked from the inn north to the river and market area, and south back to the park.  And along the way there is plenty of squares to relax or grab food or drinks at the shops along the way."
172,The hype is deserved,"We greatly enjoyed a very pleasant walk through parts of town, with a small park every several blocks.  The architecture and trees are stunning, and there is lots of history to learn.  We took the Old Savannah Tour bus and hopped on and off during the day, and found this to be a great way to see the town at our own pace and to learn and be entertained by our drivers."
173,Beautiful Buildings,We took the city tour and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who has time while in Savannah. It was so educational and we could hop on and off.
174,Have to go see it!,"Savannah is always a fun getaway city with many choices to go and see, but the Historic District is the best.  There are several historical parks, houses and points of interest to see while strolling along the tree covered sidewalks.  And when you are hungry or thirsty, there are convenient small cafes to sit and relax."
175,Fun times in the Historic District of Savannah !!,If you haven't visited this city you are missing out. So many fun homes to see and if the weather is nice you won't want to leave.
176,Rivals Charleston,"My 24 year old daughter and I had a mother daughter vacation.  We walked the historic district for 3 days.  Such a beautiful city and the River St. district is so pretty and a fun place to visit.  We were there in late September, early October and the weather was beautiful.  There are so many wonderful places to eat, shop and explore.  Such a great place for a mother-daughter vacation!"
177,Excellent area to visit,"Went through this district on an old trolley tour and it was fantastic, able to learn so much about the history of Savannah!"
178,An average experience for a fall visit,"Savannah is a city that wears its history on its sleeve, and the best way to experience it is to wander around the Historical District, admiring the old homes and wandering through shops and restaurants.  It's a major boon that this district is also beautiful and well-maintained."
179,A great City to visit and return to.,"Beautiful walk and restful informative trolley rides with Old Town Trolley Tours, beautiful diverse architecture and history"
180,Loved It,This is a very walkable city with many beautiful squares (parks). The hop on Hop off trollies provide an excellent historical narrative. Walking tours do the same.
181,Mermerising !,"We went on the hop on hop off Savannah tours, and we walked around the historic area, the Cotton House, the riverside all amazing., Savannah Seafood Shack served the best fried oysters, they were large and whole and had a light batter, like we cook them in New Zealand."
182,We wandered here for hours,"We come here as often as we can. The atmosphere is so unique and wonderful, there’s always great food, welcoming people and so much fun to be had. The city market is our favourite, and how dog friendly the area is so special. If you’re in GA this is not an area to be missed."
183,A “Must see and do”!!!,We went on a freak heat wave in September.  Would not want to go in summer.  Amazing views every where if you like architecture. Beautiful parks.  Favorite part of Savannah is the historic district.
184,A Lot of History,My husband and I simply walked up and down the streets and were amazed at the beautiful architectural and picturesque buildings and homes. We only had a day to tour the area and took in as much as we could. The city offers complimentary bus rides around the historic district making it easy to navigate. Highly recommend!
185,Great location.,"Visited for the first time and loved this place! Had a great time walking throughout Savannah seeing the beautiful historic homes, restaurants, and shops. Would visit again😊"
186,Beautiful City!,Walking the historic district is a must! We took a two-hour history walking tour with Genteel & Bard that was excellent!
187,Beautiful,Our return trip to this historic city was a delight.  We visited over the 2019 Thanksgiving weekend.  The squares each had their own character and well worth the walk. We chose a bicycle tour on the way back to our hotel. Our guide was very knowedgeable and filled in the background and history of them.
188,Savannah historical district,We enjoyed staying in the southern district at the Perry Lane. We did not like the River area too touristy and tacky.
189,We love Savannah and don’t tire of this area,My husband and I spent a week here and still did NOT see everything there is to see. Started our trip with a tour on the Old Savannah Tour Bus. That was an informative hour and a half and a great way to start the trip. It gave us an idea of where things were and what we wanted to do. Toured many mansions and museums and ate a ton of delicious food! It was a lot of walking and a lot of steps throughout the week but well worth it. Everyone should visit this beautiful historic town at least once.
190,Great time,"We were there a few times.  Just shopping, eating, enjoying the waterfront, and the history.  Don't miss the candy store."
191,Lots of walking and lots of history,"Savannah is a lovely place and I had enjoyed visiting it for many years until my bad experience during the summer of 2020. I was stopped by the police for speeding while driving on the main I-95 highway. The police officer came to my car and told me I was speeding at 95 MPH and I will get a ticket. I told him he probably made a mistake because I saw the speed on my car when he flashed his lights and it was 82 mph on a 75MPH limit highway. He insisted it was 95 and that his radar indicated that. I was driving a minivan, very hard to do that with that type of vehicle. I decided not to fight the police, took the ticket and left. I paid the fine of almost $200 online and I considered the matter solved. Surprisingly, a month later I got a notice on the mail that I should pay another $200 dollars because I was considered a super speeder driver, which means a driver who was going 15 MPH or more above the speed limit. At that moment, I understood why the highway police who stopped me insisted I was doing 95 MPH and not 82 MPH. It is a real scam run by the GA police. There is more information about this online and you can read stories about GA towns getting reach with speeding tickets.  If you plan to visit GA, I would recommend not to drive there. I personally will not be going back to Savannah or any other place in GA state ever again, unless they abolish these laws and change the police behavior. These type of laws and actions do not encourage tourism, by the contrary, they diminish it. I prefer to visit states where the police are honest and not trying to get rich out of unsuspecting driving tourists. If you have to drive there, make sure you stay at least 5 miles bellow the speed limit at all times."
192,Lovely visit,Savannah should be on every Georgians and other states bucket list. It is a nice area for some great sightseeing and also beach fun!
193,Savannah is magical,"Lots to do here, even during rain. Mostly a walking city with limited street parking. Visit the Oldest Catholic Basilica, Old Synagogue, Many Fine Restaurants & Hotels, B&B's, Tourist Sights and Parks."
194,a crazy mishmash of architecture that... absolutely works,The entire historic district is amazing.  I only wish we had more time.  Everything is within walking distance.  The day we visited it was nice and cool.  So much fun.
195,Reason why Savannah is great,"Savannah was one of my favorite old US cities.  Plenty to see and do and some very classy bars to listen to music, have cocktails and eat.  I will definitely visit it again.  One of the best places we went was Old Pink House basement bar.  Lit mostly by candles, live piano music every night, great food, drinks abs service.  We went there two of the nights we stayed and had a blast both times.  If you want to see one of the best preserved old southern cities in the US, you must go!!!"
196,Very nice trip even in the winter,Great tour!  Denise provided a thorough and entertaining tour of the historic district. The hop-on/hop-off feature made for a more enjoyable tour of the city.
197,A must see when in Savannah ,"We stayed on Liberty Street in the historic district and no matter where you turned, there was a park or historical house!  There is no way any history buff or anyone looking to learn more about our rich history should not go to Savannah!"
198,Enjoy,"It's almost like stepping back in time. The houses and businesses are so beautifully preserved. Even in the summer heat, the strolls down the streets and through the parks are so romantic and intriguing. Anyone that enjoys beautiful historic architecture should definitely visit."
199,Great area for visitors,The homes and architecture are magnificent.  We walked around for hours taking in the history.  It’s definitely worth staying in the area to enjoy the area day and night.
200,Loved it ,"Many delightful squares, good food and easy accessibility. We took a walking tour first, just to get the lay of the land and some opinions about salient sites to visit."
201,Girls Trip - Savannah,"I had heard so much about Savannah, and now I see why. I am a fan of old buildings and architecture, and the historic district was a dream to look at! I was able to explore a lot, but as this was just a weekend trip, I didn't get to see nearly enough. I will be coming back, at least one more time. Actually, it will most likely be many, many more times to come!"
202,New Years getaway ,"Went to Savannah on a couples weekend had a great time night life was amazing, a bunch of bars tours"
203,Quaint beautiful fun place,You gotta go down to the Historic District while you are in Savannah.  The homes will take your breath away.  Make sure to take plenty of pictures.
204,"Beautiful, historic, walkable","No matter what you do in the historic district, whether a docent lead tour or on your own, you will be delighted with the history and architecture that overflows in this unique place. Maps are easy to come by- explore the historic squares on your own or spring for a 20$ walking tour ( I did and just loved it!!)."
205,Walk,"My 3d visit to the restaurant and a first for the other members of our group. Always top notch service and great food.  Never disappointed. Everyone enjoyed the evening. Great experience. Call for reservations.  We went early (5:45pm) and it was quiet and uncrowded,  but when we were leaving, it was filling up and a little noisier.Will Return"
206,Midday latte and cookie,"Loved strolling around the beautiful historic district. Such an easy city to visit. Green squares, trees laden with Spanish moss and the architecture of the antebellum homes made for a most enjoyable half day."
207,"Oh Savannah, Don't You Cry For Me.","The Savannah Historic District is the reason was visited the city - along with the excellent restaurants. It is organized around squares, with with its own history. Lots of statues of heroes from colonial times, to the Revolution, to the Civil War (both sides), civic leaders, and on and on. It seems you can live through the most important periods of American history just by walking around. Lots of mature trees and flowers. Tempting restaurants and shops. Some really interesting museums. Very pedestrian friendly. All in all, it's the memory of this district that will define our sense of Savannah in the future. My advice: choose a hotel in this district and explore, explore, explore."
208,Historic Savannah,"We got to Stroll along the beautifully preserved tree lined streets and view all the wonderful period houses and Mansions of Savannahs Historic District. This area is full of great cafes, art galleries and bars, and there is also free hop on hop off tram you can use. If you get a chance, do a ghost tour. We did the Sorrel Weed mansion ghost tour, it was creepy. particularly in the stables out the back."
209,Exploring Savannah's Historic District,"Strolling the streets of Savannah is one of my favorite things to do.  The squares are all unique and provide historical info which is a plus.  The buildings, mansions, churches are all magnificent.  Lots of little places (stores, bars, restaurants) to duck into.  Savannah should be on every traveler’s must see list."
210,Savannah Lives Up to Everything I’ve Dreamed it Would Be,"Enjoyed viewing the outsides of the historic houses along the squares. St John church is a most see, the inside is amazingly beautiful."
211,Awesome Trip,"What a terrific city. Even on a cold rainy day. Easy to walk around and plenty to do in a weekend.  This city is great for foodies, history buffs, photographers and very romantic.  I saw couples and groups of women walking around. A trip that I can cross off my bucket list with great visual memories. My hubby loved the history."
212,History Alive,"What Savannah has done is pure genius.  The city has only about 140 thousand residents (I'm told), yet they took their old houses, streets and squares and renovated them instead of bulldozing them.  And for their efforts they have a fascinating and charming city dripping with history to rival Boston, Philly, Charleston and other bigger famous places.  Once they made themselves a bonafide destination, the restaurants, bars, hotels and tours followed.  Genius, and well done."
213,Vacation in savanna Ga.,"we took a recent trip to savannah and stayed in the historic district, as advised by a friend.  it was a disappointment.  hotel wasn't great and the historic district didn't live up to expectations.  we went on a bus tour and did see some nice areas, though.  rainy weather didn't help............though that's no one's fault."
214,Nice Place to Stay,"Tour the open trolley tour, it was very interesting, our driver was a little theatrical so we learned a lot of history.  Good tour"
215,Slow Down to Explore,"This was our first trip to Savannah but we are in love. We had such a good time. Stayed in this historic district, which made everything super convenient. There was something for everyone - history, gorgeous buildings, friendly people, shopping, great food. We'll be back again, Savannah!"
216,Ah Savannah,"We stayed at the River Street Inn, right in the heart of everything in Historic Savannah.   Awesome restaurants within walking distance.  There are parks every few blocks.   Visited beautifal cathedrals.  Stepped out the front door to board the River Boat, for a 2 hour cruise.   So much to do in Savannah.   I advise always staying in the Historic area, even though you have to valet park, they make it easy for you to come and go as you please."
217,Georgeous but HOT,"My boyfriend and I traveled with our pets. For starters we’re young black military and have 3 pets (yes it’s a hassle). We struggled to find a good price for a hotel or Airbnb  and ended up staying at a high end place that allowed our three pets. The energy in this place is very weird. It’s always unsettling to see a wealthy downtown area and overpriced shopping, tourist locations, and restaurants and then drive a block over and see stacks of tents under a bridge housing the homeless. I found the people at our hotel extremely pleasant which made up for the expensive hotel, but around other areas it seems like racism is normal here. This place doesn’t truly acknowledge it’s history or past and how deeply it’s been engrained even today. I’m glad we had a pleasant hotel but it’s a lot of privileged wealthy white people and the subliminal micro aggressions that start to get to you after a while are annoying. If you’re an older white person you’d fair well here. If you’re anything else I’d recommend to just drive through and don’t stop here. Overpriced and they don’t tell the full story at historical sites."
218,Savannah is WORTH the drive,"The historic district is fascinating, and beautiful.  Take your time walking around, stop as often as you can and read what is set out.  It is a great place. Go to the market area for good food and drink and then down to the river for more food and drink.  Truly a wonderful day.  It was cold the day I went in November so be sure you dress appropriately."
219,A fantastic city!,The historic district is party city at night. It was wild when we arrived around 7 pm Friday night. The key to visiting this district is walking in the opposite direction from the river and getting to where the beautiful homes are located around the squares.
220,Great place to for couples to go,Took an on-off bus ride. It featured 16 highlites you could get off bus and explore. 15 or so minutes later another bus would come by so you could continue your journey. A great way to get an over view of the city. Highly recommended.
221,Savannah was not the place for us,Great place to walk and take a history tour.  We did an ghost tour at night too through historic Savannah.
222,unexpected adventure,"Savannah is beautiful in the fall... We've been twice, both times in October and it was delightful. All of the old and stately homes, the many and varied squares (parks) sprinkled along the way... and the trees and foliage are gorgeous. Great people watching as well!"
223,Nice stroll through southern charm,"We were impressed with the history on Savannah, GA. Like other southern ports there was good and not good on the list. But this is a town that made the best they could for the era at that time. If you have the time, take a riding tour first, then one you can board/unboard so you  an futher in investigate sites of your choosing. This is a very interesting and well maintained historic district. Don't miss it!"
224,Christmas themed visit,We love downtown Savanah. The hop on hop off bus makes getting around easy. Lots to do and see and plenty of unique eating and drinking establishments.
225,Amazing Town with so much to see,The city of Savannah has it all. It was rich in history. The Trolley system is a well-oiled machine in terms of passing through many neighborhoods. The town is easily accessible by walking.The museums are very interesting and many restaurants offer good Southern cooking. Overall the city is very hospitableI stayed in a small B&B called the president's quarters and it was a very Charming experienceI will return
226,Stunning!,We took the Old Town Trolley tour and it was well worth the price.  Very interesting and enjoyable way to see Savannah.
227,Awesome,"We were staying on the IOP/Charleston and took a day trip to Savannah. The city is to die for! So historic, charming and ghostly beautiful. The Bonaventure Cemetery did not disappoint! Everything you want in a cemetery, detailed and dramatic grave stones, oaks galore with spanish moss dripping from them and it was GRAND! Very large cemetery! Truly romantic and gothic. River street was so historic and cultural. The food was awesome, definitely a foodie paradise. Savannah is breathtaking."
228,Worthwhile Tour,One of the best cities to your. Easy bus tours and drivers are very knowledgeable. Visit place where Forest Gump sat.
229,Something for everyone,We spent 5 days in Savannah and it was great!  If you get tired of walking there is a dot bus system that goes in two circles around the downtown area.
230,One of our most enjoyable vacations. We loved Charlston.,"I've visited Savannah several times and each time I find a new way to explore.  On my latest trip with two girlfriends we decided to take each square one-by-one on a self-guided tour.  Armed with a city map and online walking tour we trekked to each square, read it's history, about the landmarks and about the surrounding homes and buildings.   We split our tour into parts of two days.  It's easy to enjoy the beauty and history of Savannah just by walking around, but it really comes alive when you take the time to get to know the history of the buildings and lives of those who came before.  I challenge you to pick a few squares, stop, and explore the surroundings.  Or take a guided tour. I've done both.  You won't regret either and you may even feel a greater kinship with the past and the city itself."
231,"Ahhh, Savannah!",Took a horse and buggy ride through the historic district and covered 8 squares. Mike was our driver and Teddy was the Clydesdale horse that lead the way through the brick paved streets. Mike did a great job narrating the history of the squares as well as so many of the historical buildings. Historical downtown Savannah is definitely a place to revisit!
232,Loved our stay in Savannah,"We had never been to Savannah before, first time this past weekend.  What a beautiful place!  Having lived in Boston, we're accustomed to colonial cities with a helter-skelter layout; Savannah was planned and planned well.  Easy to navigate on foot, and the squares are beautiful.  Worth visiting if you've never been here"
233,"Take a Tour, or Walk Around","Savannah is my favorite city to visit. They have one of the nicest historic districts in the country. Sherman didn't burn it and that's what makes Savannah so special. One more thing, the people are the best!"
234,Greatly improved!!,My oldest daughter (37) and I spent a weekend in Savannah. What a treat!  The people are super friendly and the food is fantastic southern fare. The best part was all the history and unique way the city was originally planned. Highly recommend a trip if you haven’t been.
235,Gorgeous,We drove around this area one afternoon. A lot of construction was going on in the city centre. We will have to return another time.
236,Awesome ,Savannah's historic district  is ground zero for charming southern architecture.  Fortunately General Sherman did not raze the city during his infamous march to the sea and in recent years many of the spectacularly beautiful old homes have been renovated to their glory.
237,Very walkable!,"We traveled during Thanksgiving week, so we had a combination of fall/Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  The homes are so beautiful, and thanks to the preservation efforts of many, and the Savannah College of Art and Design that have restored so many homes, we are all able to view the beauty that Savannah had in the 17 and 1800s."
238,Much improved over last 20 years,Our first visit to Savannah. We took trolley tour of the city and took tours of a couple of the restored mansions. Definitely a worthwhile place to visit. So much history in a small area. We will stop here again on our next road trip to Florida. The city parks are beautiful with huge old oak trees draped in Spanish moss.
239,Great Historic Town,"We have visited Savannah before and vowed next time to stay at a boutique hotel or bed and breakfast inside the district.  Upon arrival we parked the car and left it as all sights, restaurants, river, etc. are in close proximity.  Stay in the district and enjoy the sights on a pedestrian scale."
240,The Fountain Park,"Nothing else I can add to the other reviews about this wonderful walking area. Just a few tips  I can provide, park at the first parking spot you find as they are at a premium. Ate  lunch at the British restaurant called Six Pence and it was excellent.  Read all the placards on every monument to get a feel for the history of the area.  Make sure you get a map of the area so you can get your bearings.  Many houses have a placard on the building with date it was built,  I found this fascinating."
241,The most beautiful city!,We rented an Airbnb here in a fully restored house built in 1890.  It was easily accessible to all the major attractions in Savannah.
242,So beautiful!,We walked 2 miles to this place and were not disappointed. We just stopped for drinks and cookies but the food looked so chic and tasty. We ordered macchiatos and lattes and a hot tea for our sick friend. By far the most foamy/frothy latte I’ve ever had!  The staff was friendly and fast working. Try the big cookies! Also the place was very spacious!
243,Beautiful city,"Visiting Savannah- Read ""the book"" which is Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  It will give you an appreciation of the historic district , its houses/places of interest and the people.  The beautiful historic district has been raised from the ashes of post WWII Savannah.  Very walkable, seems very safe, beautiful homes and squares.  I think it is one of the most pleasant of all US cities"
244,Stunning!,"We visited the Savannah Historic District for one day on our driving trip from New England to Florida. The Historic District has parking in many locations, both metered on the street as well as parking lots. We walked in every direction, taking in the sights and scenes.  The squares in the District are quite beautiful; there are many beautiful buildings, especially older mansions. Some are open to the public as house museums. There are plenty of small shops and restaurants (especially along Bull Street) for those looking for an activity beyond sightseeing. I highly recommend a walk in this area, especially in good weather. There are tours in the areas as well."
245,A step back in time...,I didn't expect to enjoy the historic district as much as I did. W used the hop on hop off buses and they were great for touring the area and learning about history of the city.
246,The MOST beautiful historic city!,We took the tour about 90 min on  Gray Line tours. Dan was a very  good guide;He was raised in Savannah and he showed a lot of pride for his city; Highly recommend him
247,Southern grace and charm,I had an extra day so did a detour to visit a place Ive always wanted to see.   It did not disappoint.  Great to learn about history and the beautiful Archtecture.  Fun day trip but ill go back again.
248,Amazing Architecture and Ghost Stories!,"I have traveled the world, but this was my first time in Savannah. I only had half a day to sightsee before my work would interfere. What a beautiful city. My pictures don’t capture the beauty of Savannah. I walked down Bull street, the main street of the Historic District, from my hotel (about half way) down to City Hall. I considered riding the free DOT shuttle, but decided I could see more if I walked. I passed square after square. Each square had a statue or pedestal in the center, lots of flowers and benches to sit and enjoy the quiet. There were also plaques everywhere describing the history of that part of the city. And the side streets looked like tunnels of  oak trees.  I passed a small local coffee house, and there was a gentleman sitting at a table, drinking his coffee. I had stopped to take a picture and he immediately starting talking to me, telling me about the Historic District. He pointed out that each square was exactly two blocks from the next. That the houses were all the same size. That this area had once been a series of abandoned buildings until the then mayor decided to revitalize this area. That he had lived here 35 years and it took him that long to learn all the history. And that is the epitome of Savannah. Everyone was so friendly. People were out walking their dogs or just strolling. Everyone said good morning and smiled. Such friendly people.When I got to City Hall with its gold domes, I veered around and made my way down to the river. There was an old steamboat (restaurant). There were tugboats and ferry boats on the river. I walked along the river for a while, and then back up to the main streets. I made it back to Bull Street and headed in the other direction, towards Forsyth Park. After a stop for breakfast, I continued on my journey. All in all, I explored for about 3 hours. I walked about 5 miles. And I loved every minute of exploring at least this small slice of Savannah."
249,Loved the historical district,We spent two days here on our way to Florida.  We stayed in the historic district and was able to walk everywhere.  We explored everything and would definitely recommend a visit if you’ve never been here.  Restaurants and history are fantastic!!!!
250,a most beautiful city,"The Waterfront is one way and accessible from the north end and a few cobblestone streets off the hotel row that runs parallel. It is its own little universe and a step back in time in many ways.  So many bars, restaurants, some street performers, the Georgia Queen riverboat, tour trolleys, gift shops and people. Parking is first come on the side access streets and a pay per hour public lot. Bathrooms are at a premium, mostly in restaurants or at the Visitor Center off the street.  Brick pavers and cobblestone can present some challenges to strollers, wheelchairs and plain old walking but sidewalks have gentle curb cuts.  Very lively."
251,Impressively Opulent and Beautiful!,Busy busy place shops galore. But go early to get a parking spot!  Wear comfortable shoes your walking
252,Easy Walking,Since we were traveling to get home we did a self-directed walking tour which worked for us. If you have time I think  a guided tour would be helpful to really get the historical prospective of this beautiful city.
253,BF Getaway,We enjoyed the old trolly tour thru the neighborhoods to see all the historical buildings and parks.
254,Great Place To Visit ,"Savannah is so beautiful. It reminds you of a movie set.  The trolley tour was definitely one of my favorite things to do.  We enjoyed trying different restaurants and just walking around exploring the city.  Theres so much to say about Savannah, but its Southern charm and charisma speak for itself.  Not only would I visit again, I would live here and be very happy.  The waterfront is awesome and there is so much to do and see.  But, it doesn't feel rushed. Everything and everyone seems to be moving at a pleasant and casual pace.  Sorta like somewhere to go, but not really.  It's easy to get distracted on your way somewhere and run into something equally as entertaining. I love this place!"
255,The spanish moss adds to the experience,"The historical district was easy to walk or use one of the hop on hop off trolley tours (I used Old Savannah tours).  The 22 square parks are absolutely beautiful!  Luckily I never had to move my car once I parked at the hotel (Best Western) if you do drive to the district, get there early and use a parking garage, otherwise you need to be an EXPERT parallel parker in tight spots and the parking meters only go up to  hours.There are some nice shops in the city market area, as well as good restaurants.  I had a really good lunch at Molly McPhearson's."
256,"History, Architecture and Ghosts","My wife and I had a terrific stroll down Jones Street. We heard it was one of the most beautiful streets in the country, and we weren't disappointed. We heartily recommend it. We also took a trolley tour, and we enjoyed the special homes they pointed out. The Historic district is definitely worth a visit."
257,Cool town!!,Just be sure to leave yourself enough time to see everything and wear comfy shoes! The locals are friendly and helpful.
258,Really interesting ,"We took a trolley tour, the white line, very close to a parking lot where you can park your car for free. The Historic District was really awesome. The squares so beautiful, the tour guides very sympathetic. If you go to Savannah you should take the tour, it worth it."
259,A pleasant walk back in history,"Recently had the chance to tour the area when we stopped for a day visit in Savannah.Was completely taken with the beauty and uniqueness of the District.  I've been to many historical American and other cities and found this to be one of the most stunningly beautiful and well preserved areas that I've ever seen.  The green spaces, the many neighborhood squares and the character found in the various homes - tops!  Too bad so many later American cities weren't planned as well....more for profit than for humanity.  Hats off to the folks in Savannah for their efforts to avoid losing the importance of merging past with present."
260,Beautiful,"If you're a history buff, then you've got to come to Savannah's historic district. Take a tour, buy an informative map, and just get lost in the history of the place."
261,History and beauty,"Oh how we could never tire of walking these streets! For every trip we make sure to have a few hours to walk amongst the 22 gardens, taking in the architecture & culture. We love to get lost in the streets every time & find new gems we haven’t seen before. So much history & so much southern charm! Parking available in most roads but quickly fills up."
262,"Beautiful Buildings, Lots of History","Our second visit to Savannah and it was raining cats and dogs this time, the last time it just rained. Anyway as we only had one day we braved the tropical storm and took in the beauty of Savannah. It is a beautiful and full of history. Vist the Six Pence Pub to get a bit to eat."
263,Walking and trolley tour to see the old district ,"We went to Savannah to get out of Orlando and the packed parks. It was a very nice choice to get to know Savannah, especially the historic district by foot."
264,Even great on a rainy day,"My wife and I hadn’t visited downtown Savannah in over 30 years. All I could recall about that trip was the city looked old and dirty. Not anymore!  We may like the historic district of Savannah even better than Charleston. It doesn’t have the number of fine-dining restaurants as Charleston, but we could only eat three restaurants during our stay - and they were great. We loved waking all around the historic district and were awed by the beauty of the trees and landscaping in all the parks. The area on the waterfront isn’t as niceas Charleston, but all the homes and other buildings in Savannah are restored and well kept. The combination of attractive buildings and cute parks had us planning to return to Savannah soon."
265,Beautiful Historic City A True Gem,"Our favorite experience in the city was our walking tours of the old town.  We also took a carriage tour.  The architecture is sublime, but most impressive is the city planning, the design around the green squares spaced around the town with old houses and institutions around."
266,Beautiful ,Savannah is a great area to visit. It is loaded with great places to stay so you can keep your car parked and walk or ride the trolly. We walked for exercise. Beautiful square parks with lots of history. It is a great place to ghost hunt it you are into that stuff. The horse buggy ride is a great way to see and hear some history while getting some rest. There are a lot of homeless people around the area. It is sad to see them . Most of them just hold up a sign. Remember to help those less fortunate. The lines are long to get into restaurants. But remember if there isn't a line it is either off the pathway or it might not be that good. Get out and see the world and have fun. Stop and see the beautiful God has made.
267,Love of history and art brought me here,"Overall Savannah was as we expected, considering we were here during the pandemic of 2020. many of the places we wanted to see, such as fort Jackson, fort Pulaski, and Sherman's headquarters during the civil war, we're all closed due to the covid-19 issues. Overall though, the city was open, the people were extremely friendly and glad to see the tourists. We did not have any problems finding food, in the Marshall House hotel was extremely nice to us."
268,Step Back in Time,"There are over 24 square blocks in the historic district, and we walked each block over a three-day period. Also took the old Savannah Trolley tour to get the feel of it first. There are many beautiful homes (from mansions to apartments), churches, and parks that it is hard for us to say which block is the best. Although Forsyth Park is by far the biggest and prettiest of the parks with a lovely fountain. No matter how you see it, by car, trolley or just walking this is a area worth the time to visit.  See the beauty and history"
269,Trolley tours,We took a tour on the Old Town Trolly. We made a full circle and saw where we wanted to get off the next round. So fun and informative. The Historic District goes on all over town
270,Beautiful southern architecture,So this is the south. Expect some bugs and heat. But in Savannah expect to have the time of your life!
271,A must see on your Savannah trip!,"Part of our family decided to have a small reunion in historic Savannah, and we had a great time.  We had no problem finding places to eat, and enjoyed walking around the squares and seeing the historic areas.  However, if you do not feel comfortable being close to people during this pandemic, don't go.  It didn't bother us, but there are so many people walking around that there is little social distancing possible, and most are not wearing masks.  It's probably worse on weekends."
272,Beautiful Homes and History,"We came to Savannah for a romantic weekend. Our house was on W. Jones St, directly across from The Wilkes House. The street and the city is beautiful!"
273,MUST SEE IN SAVANNAH,We went on the historic tour with Big Ken at first and learned so much. The we hopped on with Holly Jolly. Thank you both for sharing all the stories and information.
274,Beatiful place to visit,"We stopped in Savannah to walk and shop with the family. There is so much to see and do here. We plan on visiting again soon (kid-free) so that we can explore all of the historic sights and southern restaurants. The streets are a bit narrow, especially if you're stuck driving beside a trolly, so I recommend parking and walking the town whenever possible. They also offer bus and trolly tours. We got to see a few of the horse and carriages trotting about. That is definitely something I look forward to when we return."
275,First Trip to Savannah ,"We picked up a free Savannah guide at the airport and used it to walk all 24 historic squares downtown. Just enough info to keep it interesting. Historic homes and churches abound and decorated doorways made for nice photos.Good shopping in Broughton St—don’t miss Savannah Bee for honey items, Leopolds for the best ice cream ever, and the artistic chocolates by Adam Turoni. Paris Market has cute home goods and accessories."
276,Worth the walk,"If visiting the district, having never been there before, by all means, take the tour. You will never learn what makes it a Historic District without there knowledge."
277,savannah historic district,"If you've never been to Savannah's historic district, grab your bags and go right now! They have a little something for everyone"
278,Walk all 24 squares!,"We'd made reservations the 2nd week of September for 3 nights in Savannah and the website recommend that we take the Old Town Trolley tours. When learned that a hurricane was pending and locals were being evacuated, we called to cancel our reservations for the motel and the trolley tour. To our dismay the trolley tour said it couldn't be cancelled, but would be good for up to 6 months. The initial website boldly stated the trolley tour could be cancelled. After some time we gave up and were disappointed to have lost over $60. When we found a free week we again made motel reservations and expected to use the paid for trolley tour. We learned upon arrival that "" Old Savannah Tours"" offered a much better experience with a shuttle service to boor, at close to the same price.we want to warn people coming to Savannah about the ""Old Town Trolley"" scam and to know they have a better option in ""Old Savannah Tours""."
279,Charming ,"I met my daughter in Savannah and we proceeded to spend five days seeing the sights there. We enjoyed many restaurants for our meals, my favorite being the Olde Pink House.  The attractions were very interesting and I was amazed at how many haunted sites there were in this town.  It was pretty spooky to be escorted through several of them with a tour guide.  The riverfront street and it's shops were a treat for the eyes.  I enjoyed the trolley rides too."
280,A beautiful place!,"Spent a few days in Savannah with majority of our time spent in the historical district. Pretty well parked our car at out B and B and walked for 3 days. Atmosphere very different from other cities we have visited. Very intriguing history with lots to see. We felt safe walking anywhere we went including evenings. Lots of great restaurants, bars and attractions. I do have to wonder what genius thought it would be a good idea to put a large and very tall cellular tower in a scenic historical district of a city."
281,Beautiful,Wandering around the old streets of Savannah must be one of the best ways for a tourist to spend a day in the USA
282,What a beautiful city!,We used the free Savannah guide and did our own walking tour. We would love to go back and take a paid tour. Wear comfortable shoes.
283,Great history,"We decided to stop and spend an extra day to see the city. We did a tour so we get a proper narrative of all the highlights the city had to offer. We elected to do the Old Town Trolley tour but there are quite a few operating that may suit your needs. There's walking tours, biking tours, horse drawn tours and few trolley tours. If you're passing through in your travels, you owe it to yourself to stop and check this town and the history out."
284,Gracious Savannah ,There was more garbage On the streets than there was stuff to do. Disgusting over flowing garbage cans everywhere. Planters along side walks were filled with cans and mini bottles. There was a hand towel completely full of blood Dried and crusted to Broughton Street. The food was awful. I suppose if you are drunk the entire time like everyone else was then it doesn’t matter. I was extremely disappointed because people y’all about how great it is. Yea I don’t think I will ever go back and I’m sure the people who live there don’t care if I do or not. Waste of time and money.
285,Savannah,We had a great day.  Ben was a great tour guide and told us so much history about Savannah.  The steamboat ride was pretty great too.
286,My Backyard,"We moved to Savannah area almost 20 yrs ago and historic district got much nicer during this period. I believe it is SCAD’s influence. Houses are not as spectacular as those of Charleston old town, but there are some historic houses worth visiting inside."
287,Wonderfully unique.,"The 2.5 square miles of the Savannah historic district is filled with one historic home after another.  Houses dating from the 1700’s and 1800’s are numerous, many excellently restores to their original spendor.  The houses are nestled into a grid of streets, gardens, squares, churches, and cemeteries.  Spend an afternoon or many days just traveling back in time."
288,A MUST See. Period.,Did they drop off pick up trolley and got to see alot .Beautiful Architecture Great Food and alot of people
289,Old Town Trolley,"We took public transportation to the historic district. Walking the cobblestone streets, enjoying the beautiful manicured gardens, and the amazing sunset was so nice especially at the end of November when it wasn't so crowded. There are many little shops, gourmet restaurants, and outdoor cafe's as well."
290,Ms. J. Gregoire,"My wife and I took an extended weekend visit to Savannah, and spent a lot of time exploring the Historic District. It is hard to put the size and the charm of the historic district into words. We spent hours walking around and looking at all of the beautiful homes and buildings, and toured a few of them. There are also lots of great restaurants, bars, and shops in the area. Savannah is definitely worth the trip to visit the historic district."
291,Very wet day in Savannah ,Until our last day we had no problems until we requested a late check out . We were told ten other people requested it therefore we could not. When we rushed back to check out in time there was a line and about a twenty minute wait.
292,Fascinating ,"We decided this year to stop in Savannah during our annual migration from Michigan to Florida.  Spending eight days in Savannah proved to be well spent.  After visiting the most helpful visitor center we took the Locally owned Old Savannah Trolley tour to get an overview of the city.  The rest of the week was filled exploring Savannah and many good restaurants, the Crystal Beer Palace was our favorite.  Touring the Mercer-Williams house was special after listening to “the book” on the trip down in our motor home."
293,Two Days in Savannah,We spent a leisurely day touring the downtown historic district. No problem with social distancing. Most people were wearing their masks
294,"Savannah: A city filled with history, interesting architecture, and intrigue!","We come down to Savannah three or four times a year and love bicycling and walking the Historic District.  The abundant squares help keep vehicle traffic slow enough that bicycling is easy, and there are bike racks everywhere so that you can park and walk or try our a new restaurant or shop.  A magical town for sure!"
295,You must visit Savannah,My husband and I came to Savannah for a three day get a way. We took this tour our first day. The convenience of getting on and off the trolly was great. The guides were informative and entertaining.  They gave great information on the history of the city. We took the entire tour all the way through the 15 stops to gather information and decide which stops we wanted to get our and explore.  The trolleys come to each stop every 15 minutes as stated do you never wait long.  You also get different drivers (guides) each time so the information is a little different and you learn more with each one. We had five different guides throughout the day. I would definitely recommend this tour and will take it again when we come back!
296,Sightseeng,"I made a last-minute plan change to include Savannah in my visit to Georgia. The ideal time to visit this place is in spring when flowers are blooming, but my near-term travel plan rules out this possibility so a compromise has been made. My first impression visiting Savannah is when searching for hotels convenient for my stay, and all its hotels in the historic downtown area are fairly expensive even in fall. I decided to check out its downtown parking facilities on the internet and concluded staying about 20-minute drive away would be a good move.  The hotels are much cheaper in the out-of-Savannah area and the downtown parking can be as cheap as $10 a day when we don't park close to the river-front area.  My research was well paid off in this case.  When I finally got to Savannah downtown that fall evening, I found those hotels at the river-front are in fact far from ideal. I have to say comparing with Chicago lake front and San Francisco Bay in fall, I do not consider Savannah water-front that good.  It is by no means a bad place to visit but for the hotel price in this downtown area, I have much better idea where I would like to spend my money. In my brief visit to Savannah, the downtown area could be a beautiful spot to walk around and relax during spring and summer time.  There are many small squares along our walking path so this would make the visit fun and enjoyable.  But without the flowers, I was left with my imagination how great this would be looking at the green grass and surrounding architecture.  When I got to the Forsyth square the next morning,  there was a sport event happening. It is not a big park but there is a beautiful fountain.  There were lot of people there that morning and the lack of proper toilet facilities was really a big turn-off.  People were lining up to enter portable bathrooms located along the side of the walkway through the park, and you could really smell their presence there.  We took some pictures walking around the park once and decide to leave that area. So our visit to Savannah was better and more fun in the water front area. Overall re-visiting Savannah is not a priority item in my vacation list after this visit. If I happen to re-visit the Charleston area, which is a cheaper and better vacation spot on my book, a side trip to see Savannah in summer or spring can be a good idea."
297,One of the great cities of the USA,"Daughter and I spent 2 days in historic district.   Did Old Savannah trolley one day to get lay-out of area, walked around following day.  Everything you need or want is here.  Friendly people."
298,Bicycling and walking paradise!,What a wonderful day.  We stopped on our way home in Florida from a recent stay outside Toronto.  Savanah is even better than we imagined and even more charming thank any photo thanks to the local residents.  Everyone wanted to say hello even in this crazy time.  They would come off the porch and just say welcome.  My wife and I are seriously coming here to retire.  And we’ve only been here 1 day.Beautiful place and the people make it even better!
299,Houses wonderful,"When I was in high school, a friend of mine took a day trip to Savannah and came back with an unsatisfactory review. It turns out his mother wanted to go visit the city so mom and dad packed up the car with 5 young brothers to go explore. The 3 hour trip from the suburbs of Atlanta apparently took a toll on Mr Rubin and he was in no mood to linger in the town. He always was a bit cranky and so the family drove around town for about a half hour and turned back home.What a waste of a Saturday afternoon! Savannah is a beautiful, romantic and adventerous place with loads of history, charm and delightful places to explore and admire.The town itself is full of parks called ""squares"" that are spaced every couple of blocks. My wife and I have also wanted to visit Charleston SC but cannot imagine it being as nice as Savannah. There are so many restaurants with superb quisine you would never want tfor anything more while you're here. You can take a tour by land, by sea, or both, but there is a free bus service that makes walking around very easy and convenient. We mostly walked as the city is small enough for a 60 year old man with a bad back to traverse sans the pain, but large enough to require multiple trips to soak it all in.The waterfront if agressively being built up to attract more tourist dollars and I mean this as a positive, not a negative. I look forward to our next trip, and honestly, we have even thought aboout retiring here. The old oaks, moss, acient brickwork and cobblestone make it hard to resist.We stayed a couple miles outside the historic district to save money and it was a quick and easy drive into town. Parking was easy and free (for the holiday and weeekend). I wondered why Waze had us take a long route into town, but eeventually figured out I could simply drive directly in with no worries.I highly suggest Savannah as a place to visit, just as I would Helen or Sky Valley, Atlanta or any of the other fabulous places that Georgia has to offer."
