It is the most happening place for young crowd and also equally comforting to all ages. As I told you will feel like walking through Times Square in New York or Champs-Élysées, Paris....almost. The only difference is this is not a fashion street but a large food court. Instead of small stalls, there are restaurants of all taste, size and shape with unlimited sitting capacity (all together).The only catch is that food is as costly as fine dining, didn’t share my bill to avoid discouraging you. But you should come and enjoy once before making up your mind.We had Chinese food followed by wonderful waffles (small side stall). We sat at the centre court, watching India playing World Cup cricket in giant screen.We left around 12 midnight and it was perfectly safe for our family.Must visit if you have stepped in Gurgaon, if not for the food but for the lights and mood....it is contagious."

The few shopping points are also a good addition. The rocking music flowing from the discs on the top floor is like a balm for the soul.The rare open air match display, music festivals are amazing. A must watch. To summarise it all, its a great place to kill time for youngsters. The kids might not like it. Even the elderly seem to like it- from what I have observed."
102,Monsoon masti @ cyberhub,In look and feel could be a pedestrian street comparable to any where in the developed world..caters to niche and specialty culinary demands as also the regular affordable chains ....worth a stroll once in a while !

111,Must visit place,"At the first glance it appears to be like a part of a foreign city, architecture, cleanliness, culture, choices of pubs, bar/lounges and restaurants offerinf all tyoes of cuisines.

129,Best thing about gurgaon,During my visit to Gurgaon my team took me to the Hub. It was a good experience and you shouldn't miss it
130,FOOD @ TCK BY THE CHINA KITCHEN,"An impromptu programme landed us in DLF cyber hub a day after holi.the weather was JUST perfect to stroll around. The newly opened shopping places like, uniclo, marks and Spencer, decathlon and gifts of love offer quick shopping options for the people on the go.The numerous offices provide the appropriate clientage for the various eateries and the newly opened stores.The chola kulcha at United Coffee House, were just yum, crispy! the beer jug with a complimentary tandoori platter was value for money.A quick visit to the uniclo added to my wardrobe . Must visit in this season."
131,Happening...,This inside sitting area is completely the behaviour of the staff was very casual and unprofessional the food was ggod but the portion size was very small. Must work on the sitting plan and staff behaviour
132,Super happening Place...,DLF Cyber Hub is a Tech Hub in Gurgaon. It hosts many IT/ITES Offices in its arena. People regularly come here to do jobs.
133,Tourist place,We visited this cyber hub by chance. We got late while returning from Jaipur and we were very hungry. We requested our driver to halt at some good restaurant. At that moment we were near Gurugram city. He took us there. We never expected such a good cluster of restaurants here. We enjoyed the food and the place.
134,Look and feel of DEVELOPED INDIA,"Wheater you are looking for a quick drink with your colleagues after office or a chilled out evening with friends; A quick lunch within your lunchtime or a relaxed lunch/dinner with friends or family. This is the place to head out. Equally approachable from South Delhi and Gurgaon.  Though tucked in the commercial hub of Gurgaon but offers complete entertainment for all age groups. wheelchair friendly.  Variety of cuisines, pubs, bars, breweries and now additionally shopping too. So head out and enjoy your day here."
135,place for all age groups,"Whenevr you're in Cyber hub you just get the different feeling as if youre in some wonderland. Amazing architecture and great ambience with a diverse options of entertainment - fantastic restaurants of all cuisine, exclusive bars, best DJs playing my favourite music, children's fun and lots more. A place for all ""kids to Elders"" (Age 0yrs - 100yrs) Come along with family, friends you'll find a Place for all."
136,family dinner,Its an attempt at imitating the western atmosphere and they seem to have done a better job of it then in the west. But that is it. If you have not booked in advance be prepared to wait it out and then be prepared to empty your wallets. A meal for two with some good malt or lager can easily offset you by 12K+. In return you dont get anything as far as memories is concerned. Avoid driving there as parking can be a nightmare and another ripoff. Its a great place to go to if you are on the companies account and entertaining some folks to rip them off through your company subsequently.....lol....Jokes apart Gurgaon or Gurugram has awesome outstanding places to go to in half the price and value for money. Where food is lip-smacking drinks out of the world and they dont rip your pocket apart.
137,Sudhir Gandhi ,"Cyber Hub Gurgaon rejuvenated you completely! If you had a tough day in office, unwind at DLF Cyber Hub in any of the restaurants, Pubs, casual eating joints or the Food Court. He most lively place in Gurgaon or for that matter in India!!I specially recommend Farzi Cafe, Burma Burma (Vegetaian, no alcohol), the Wine Company, Cafe Delhi Heights, Chokola et al."
138,Cyber hub visit,I have now been there a number of times but the first time was a shocker. I felt transported to nothing less than New York.If its food your in the whorst place to be in there just too many good choices that you will end up feeling like you may have to come back a hundred times just to try out everything. Its a gluttons paradise. Just too much good food. My fav is the wine company but it does not matter if you veg or non veg you get anything you can dream of.The central court has a space for people to perform and some times you can catch a great band or a dance performance.Its a happy and safe place to unwind and the gentry is good dont worry too much of what your wearing no one is going to whistle or cat call heeee
139,The most happening place in all of Gurgaon!,"I visited for an evening on our marriage anniversary and liked it so well and good that we took our children back because the entire hub is for food buffs. My daughter enjoyed her Japanese Sushi and we went for the beer.On the whole, it was an excellent experience"
