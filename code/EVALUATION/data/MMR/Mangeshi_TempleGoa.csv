35,Historic temple with diverse architectural styles,"The Mangeshi temple is the family deity or Kul daivat of the great Indian Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar and her family. The temple of Shri Mangesh is set amidst natural beauty and pleasant surroundings.Mangeshi, a little village along Goa’s Panaji-Ponda road is not only a point of pilgrimage for the followers of the Lord, it attracts hundreds of tourists from all over India and abroad. This temple had its origins in Kushasthali Cortalim, a village in Salcette which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started Christian conversions in Salcete district, the Saraswats of Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Aghanashini to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja district, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure.Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and yet another time in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha holy vessel was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple.The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The Peshwas donated the village of Mangeshi to the temple in 1739 on the suggestion of their Sardar, Shri Ramchandra Malhar Sukhtankar, who was a staunch follower of Shri Mangesh. Ironically, just a few years after it was built, this area too fell into Portuguese hands in 1763, but by now, the Portuguese had lost their initial religious zeal and had become quite tolerant of other religions, and so, this structure remained untouched.The main temple is dedicated to Lord Mangesh, an incarnation of Lord Shiva. Bhagavan Mangesh is worshipped here as Shiva linga. According to the legend, Lord Shiva had manifested into a tiger to scare his wife Parvati. Paravati, who was frightened at the sight of the tiger, went in search of Lord Shiva and cried out, ""Trahi Mam girisha!"" (Oh Lord of Mountains, save me!). Upon hearing the words, Lord Shiva turned himself back to his normal form. The words ""mam girisha"" became associated with Lord Shiva and over time the words got abbreviated to Manguirisha or Mangesh.He is the kuldevta or family deity of many Goud Saraswat Brahmins in Hindu community.Overall must visit destination in Goa for its sheer history !"
36,Mangeshi temple,"Shri Mangeshi Temple located at Mangeshi Village in Priol, Ponda taluk of Goa is one of the largest and most visited temple in Goa. It is a must visit if you are in Goa.

The distance of the Mangueshi temple from Panaji is 22 km.Mythology says that Lord Shiva had once visited the land distraught after losing heavily to his wife Parvati at a game of dice. As Goddess Parvati came looking for him, he tried to prank her by shape shifting into a tiger and frightening her. Seeing the predator in front of her, Parvati shrieked and prayed uttering the following words Trahi Mam Grisha, roughly translated this means “O Lord of the Mountains, save me”. Upon hearing her plea Shiva reverted to his usual form and returned to Kailash with her.Shiva came to be known as Lord Manguesh due Parvati’s words Mam Grisha that remains associated with the land and the tale. The original location where the temple was built is presently the location of village Cortalim, located at the south of the Zuari River. It was during the Portuguese invasion that the deity was shifted Priol, where it remains till this day."

The walk from the parking lot of the temple is about 500mts and there are steps to be climbed. For kids and old folks, please take some water and walk with slippers, there is a facility to store footwear at the entrance."
84,Small & Peaceful,This is old historical temple and wort place to visit if you are religious minded.Lata Mangeshkar belongs to this village
85,old temple,"We visited this temple in last week of April 2016 after a darshan in Shantadurga Devi Temple , also located in Ponda . We climbed the steps to reach the temple and first thing we saw was the Deepstambha....the light tower . This is seven story high and can accommodate a large number of oil lamps which are lit on special religious festivals. The main temple has the Shivalinga , a representation of Lord Shiva . We learnt that the temple has a long history starting from the year 1560 A.D.. The temple has been renovated on three occasions between mid eighteen to late nineteen centuries. There are number of structures near the temple to accommodate the visiting devotees .The environment around the temple is charming and is hilly. The campus is well maintained. Overall , it creates a very pious ambiance. Our return  travel of 22Kms. back to Panaji was full of sweet memories."
86,Very Good Temple,A gorgeous temple of Lord Shiva. A very old but now renovated is a well known Shiva temple amongst devotees and tourist. Mangeshi Mahadev has golden mukha with adorable human face. It’s a big temple with all the facilities to stay and a canteen to eat. Puja is being done on behalf of the devotees. Worth visiting.
87,Nice Architecture,"While visiting Goa, made a point to visit Mangeshi Shiva Temple. It is Situated in the village that is also famous for being the native village of melody queen Lata Mangeshkar. Like all parts of Goa, the road to templetown passes through an undulating terrain though lush green hills. Given it’s a small village, local body has made sure that cars are parked outside the village access road. This leaves the last about 500 meters to walk before one reaches the main entrance of temple. Climbing about 20 odd steps, one crosses the main gate and enters the vast grounds of temple. What surprises one is the temple architecture. Unlike a traditional temple with a pointed step tower above the sanctum sanctorum,  the temple appears like a dome of a basilica. From distance, the temple appears like a church complex. Possibly, a fusion of Hindu Temple Architecture with Portuguese history and Roman Catholic Church styles. The inner hall of temple is decorated with numerous glass chandeliers - again very different from traditional Hindu temples. Temple is however very clean and environs so soothing and serene. When visiting Goa, this should be a must visit site, just like Basilica of Bom Jesus or Se Cathedral."
88,Chaos !,"This year on 10th Nov, we stayed at Mangeshi temple for a night. The room is within temple premises with split a/c. Canteen is also in the premises. It is very convenient for doing all rituals in the temple. There are restaurant outside which serves traditional Goan veg food and also fish, if you need. Overall good experience."

99,Mangeshi temple,"It is mentioned on the plaque at the entrance of the temple that the original idol has been relocated to present site of Ponda in Goa from another location where there was heavy threat of ritual restrictions during Portuguese rule & atrocities introduced at the time of Inquisition.  From Karmali railway station which is the nearest railway stop to go to Panjim city this place is about 30 minutes by car.  On the main road there is distinct marking to indicate the temple site.  One has to get down at the car park & walk a narrow street dotted with souvenir shops, fruit & drink stalls as well as prayer material vendors before taking a flight of stairs to enter the temple complex which is quite spacious.  There is a water tank adjacent & view from the top is pleasant with surrounding coconut trees in the background.  A white painted lamp tower with golden arc borders is present besides the rose flower garden.

The temple architecture is unique with white dominating and a tower within the complex.   The idol survived the Portuguese Inquisition for 500 years, when many other Hindu religious landmarks were completely destroyed.  This aspect gives the temple more importance.  I had a wonderful visit and it a bit of a walk from the car park.  Along the walk there are many shops and restaurants and it presents a carnival atmosphere with families visiting.   A peaceful, serene comes upon one on visiting the temple and one needs to reflect on the spiritual energy this temple emanates to you."

If you have senior citizens or people who cannot walk upto the temple, the guards will allow your car to pass and take it right till the temple steps. The area inside the temple is pleasing and really big. At the centre is the main Mangeshi Temple, which is dedicated Lord Shiva."

119,Very beautiful Shiva temple,"Said to be commissioned by the famous (Lata) Mangeshkar family, this is one of the local attractions to visit in Goa.

153,Har Har Mahadev....  All your wishes come true. ,"It is located on a hill and a road leads to the small stairs to the temple. It is a very modest temple like the ones in bali as they know people come to goa to chill and may not be appropriately dressed, they offer free cloth like sarong to used to cover knees. Unlike in bali where they charge a lot to rent sarongs. We felt very peaceful and calm after visiting this temple. The market on the way is also good but be aware you need to bargain big. If you are having your own vehicle drive through cortlaim village and enjoy the jetty ride as well."

155,What a beautiful and peaceful temple,"If i am in Goa, i do visit Mangeshi as this is our kuladevata. But apart from that actually a must visit place. If possible dont miss the Palkhi which is on every Monday. It is a grand celebration. The view of the temple on this Night is simply magical. There is even place to stay within the Temple but is restricted. Its always nice to stay and since the same is built arond the temple its gives a clam and plesant feeling. Would recommend to wear clothes which cover your legs completly i.e. full pants or else will have to get the dhoti or chunni to do that as the entry is restricted with western outfit.Again the entry in the main temple very well know as ""Gabhara"" (The innermost division of temple) is restricted, however from the place from where we can see the idol gives a good view. Photography is restricted as it is in most of the temples.Non-Veg is strictly prohibited and the canteen inside the temple premises have some delicious maharashtrian delicacy. For people who would like to have the feel of some goan non-veg food if you step out of the temple there are a few eateries popularly know as ""Khanaval"" who serves authentic goan food mainly fish and sol kadi are one of my favourites. Its a home made food."

183,Mangeshi Temple,"I wished to visit this temple as it is a fine example of the typical Goan Hindu style of architecture. It is a beautiful temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Considered to be the most important temple in Goa, it is located on a hillock at Proil which is in the Ponda Taluka of Goa,about 21 km from the capital Panjim. It is one of the largest, wealthiest and most frequently visited temples in Goa.The temple was originally built in a village named Kushasthali which is now known as Cortalim, in Salcette. When Salcette was invaded by the Portuguese, the idol was removed to a safer place and later consecrated in the present location in 1560. It was a simple structure then. The present form of the temple is attributed to the rule of the Peshwas (Prime Ministers of the Maratha Empire) in the 18th century.Apart from the main deity, the beautiful white deepastambha (lamp tower), a prominent nandi bull statue and the temple tank, believed to be the oldest part of the temple are highlights of the temple complex.The complex also has shrines of Goddess Parvati and Lord Ganesha and many other deities. The beautiful white temple is a treat for the eyes and the spiritually inclined. The premises are very clean and well maintained.The parking space is situated about 800 meters from the main temple. The road from here to the temple is flanked by a number of souvenir shops which I feel is not in tune with the atmosphere of the place. Trudging upto the temple especially in a hot day is not really a pleasant experience. This area could have been used for a parking space. Commercial considerations have been given precedence over comfort of visitors.Photography is not allowed at the interiors of the temple."
184,"Vast complex in the deity of has God, his son Jesus and Satan","It is one of the best temples in Goa - better than Shantadurga temple, in terms of architecture and magnificence. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is very peaceful and tranquil - we spent some time there, to rest and soak in the divine peace. Has got decent food and drinking water facilities near the temple with very well maintained temple walls, painted very recently. Has got a big tower, with gothic architecture in traditional Portuguese style, which is the hallmark of Goa. Very unique in its build - never seen a temple, that so closely resembbles a church! Its orthogonal in shape and possibly one of the only temple in India, which has a tall minar / watch tower within its premises."
185,nice,We stayed in the temple premises and trust me it was one of the most divine experience  . The temple has its own beauty during the different times of the day . Try out the breakfast in the temple canteen its tasty .
186,Clean and calm temple,Visited with friends but liked Mangeshi temple..it is calm and quiet place to see.. Normally people who visit Goa add this place in their travel list..
187,Religious Place,This is a very well maintained temple complex with not much of crowd . As per the folk lore if one drinks the water offered to the deity here Maa Saraswati blesses you with great voice.There is enough parking space for cars and buses in front of the complex with local market for shopping and food.
188,"Beautiful and Clean, Calm Temple","We went to the temple as it was on way, the temple is really beautiful and there is good place to sit, relax and do your prayers.. Must visit if you love to visit temple..What was inconvenient, was the fact that we have to park our vehicle Half a KM earlier, with my elder parents and a 6 month old baby, it was difficult to walk in hot sunny day.. What was more bad was some vehicles were allowed (Govt. Local etc).."
189,Peaceful! ,The rooms in the Mutt are really good. Only catch is that Lord Mangesh should be your family god. Rooms are a short walk away from the temple with good parking space.
190,One of the famous temples in Goa.,"Its a good place. The temple is in south goa, we went through day travel over there.Peaceful area and meditation time could be spent"
191,Beautiful Temple !!!,"The mangeshi temple is a must-visit, for it stands as a testimony to the goan architecture. I was told that the great singer Lata Mangeshkar hails from this village. We went to the temple on an evening and spent some time relaxing inside the temple complex. I could feel positive vibes inside this well-maintained temple."
192,Nice temple,Majestic temple of Goa . It's ancient and managed by four gsb families . Some of the reviews mention that they had to walk some distance but there is a side entrance which takes your vehicle at the temple door step . There is ample parking space . Felt blessed after visiting this temple . But kindly follow temple rules and don't take offence . Do u object if you are given a dress code say formal in office? So no harm if you follow rules in any temple .
193,"Sacred place, must visit",Well maintained -differnt type of structure -with Deepmal in front of Temple - not very crowdy place. The temple is very Nice
194,Seek Lord Shivas blessings,"My family was introduced to unique architectural pattern by visiting this first Temple in Goa state. Large, Spacious, maintained & clean campus. The temple premise inside prohibited for photography. The quiet & devotional atmosphere instilled peace of mind & soul with help of some minutes of meditation with intensive devotion. Scenic location surrounded by palm trees. Pujaris ensured discipline & not seen vouching or queing up for some expectations. Great feeling."
195,Felt blessed ,One of the most beautiful temple in old Goa !Serenity and beauty are welcoming you in a stunning marble edifice .Most recommended !
196,FELT BLESSED,"This is by far one of the best temples in the India and the very best of Goa. It is of historic importance to not only the GSB community who patonize lord Mangesh as the presiding deity of thier Kul, but also to Goas culture and tourism. When in Goa, one should definitely seek the lords blessings. Om Namah Shivay!"
197,Divine,The eye catching beauty of the temple and the tower around can leave one dumbstruck. It is dedicated to lord shiva. Visitors are advised to wear clothes sensibly otherwise you will be denied entry. Or else one has to buy piece of cloth from the temple complex to cover the revealing parts of the body.
198,Beautiful temple !!,Shiva temple! Serene place. Very well maintained. Good place to visit during any time. Can spend good one hour. Very good surroundings. One can also visit Balaji temple nearby. Good shops around for any quick street shopping.
199,Beautiful temple,"this is very beautiful temple, set up in outer city area. we drove and used the GPS and it was very easy for us, else you will have to ask the locals. they are helpful"
200,very nice place to get relax. & find real peace,"It is really great place to visit with family and friends. Basically this is ancestral town of famous singer Lata Mangeshkar. Temple is just besides main road and approx. half hour drive from Panaji. Public transport is very less frequent, so better rent a bike in Panji. Temple is so beautiful that you can feel Divine blessing of Lord Shiva. My suggestion is you should visit Mahalasa temple just 1km from Mangeshi, which is lesser known basically. Mahalasa temple is one of the most calm and holy temple I have ever visited."
201,awesum temple ... very well maintained,Visited this temple in October 2014. We saw a huge queue so couldn't go inside the temple. But from the outside it was just awesome. Neatly maintained temple.
202,Long walk past a lot of pushy salesmen to reach it,i visited this temple on morning time. at that time temple and surroundings and totally cam and quite. some poojas were going. no rush with visitors. we should keep the religious value in this temple.
203,Interesting but not worth the detour,The main temple is part of a larger temple complex that consists of smaller temples and living quarters for staff as well as travellers who need accommodation at very nominal charges.The place is very well maintained.The temple's approach is surrounded by shops of locals selling stuff for pooja along side other trinkets. A very famous place and must visit attraction.
204,Nice Shiv Ji Temple,"Temple is indeed nice inside but poor facilities as one has to stand outside under the sun for atleast 30 mins as no shelter to get inside the temple. A historical background with theme of Lord Shiva and revered by the Saraswat Brahmins, well maintained for certain."
205,One thing to watch apart of Churches,So nice Temple building and it’s spotless colours and beautiful design and very clean surrounding is unique here . Dazzling diety of Lord Shiva is so different and attractive that I felt enormous peace and happiness looking and offering my prayers . A must place to visit in Goa if you like visiting temples .
206,En-route visit to holy Shiva temple,"Nice temple in Goa having nice architecture, Little shopping place outside temple road.One can spent 30 min to 1 hr in temple"
207,Magnificent !,good to go. very nice to watch and good for all of us. it is a temple to watch lord shiva. very nice temple
208,Lord Shiva Temple,"Its a beautiful and very well maintained complex. Its the first time I visited a temple in Goa, was in complete awe."
209,worth a visit,"We visited Goa from few days ago. Visit to Goa with out Mangeshi temple visit is not worth visiting GoaTemple is nice, clean & decorated. One get piece of mind once to enter the temple. Got the blessing from almighty Mahadev God. Also seen huge Rath, every year procession in Jan end or Feb start.Happy to know that food is available at canteen. Food was very good.Wonderful visit to Mangeshi temple"
210,Lord Shiva Temple,A beautiful temple. Its history neatly written for all visitors. Architecture typical of Goa. Felt very peaceful. Only problem was the parking place is very far and had to convince the security to permit us to be dropped near the temple.
211,cam and quite,very serene temple. expansive one. very clean and beautiful. in a very quaint village in goa. supposed to the ancestral temple of the legendary lata mangeshkar. just go there and sit clam and pray to the lord shankar. supposed to be a
212,Very attractive holy place in Goa.,Very nice temple and good place to visit. kept neat and clean which I like when visiting temple.  Nice sugarcane juice was available outside with good taste.  To reach this template you need walk approx 1 km from parking while Car are reaching till gate with discrimination and choice of guard without clear guidelines at gate. As per board (tried to erase)  taxis not allowed but taxis going and personal vehicles with mercy of guard allowed.
213,Nice place pf worship,"Visited during a recent visit. Is a nice small temple, but similar to others in that area. It is clean and well maintained. Enjoyed the visit. Would recommend a visit if in the vicinity."
214,Devine!,"Despite the hordes of tourists and pilgrims that visit the temple, it has a clean and spiritual look. It feels like you have reached home. The evening arti (prayers) is worth seeing."
215,Unique Goan temple architecture,Calm place with beautiful temple architecture.. Though it is in the interior of Goa it worth a visit
216,Very beautiful and serene,"This 16th century temple with a history is a place worth visiting and a must visit if you are around this place.. Beautifully maintained, open even at late evenings..This is a Lord Mangesh temple (one Avtar of Shiva if I am correct). Visiting this temple is one among those different things I would consider doing in Goa."
217,"Kind of cool, but cannot rival comparable temples in Thailand","Nothing much to say. The drive from Panjim to temple is fun. As a Hindu i visit all local known temples, so Mangeshi is always on list during Goa tour. Approach to the temple is very commercialized with lots of shop like a flea market. Being a temple they expect you to dress appropriate for obvious reasons."
218,Very Beautiful and peaceful Temple,"A Shiva temple though centuries old did not have a feel of a very commercialised temple.It was more like a temple of extended 24 families that initially took care of the temple.It was peaceful and clean.Facilities like water tap to wash hands after removing footwear, drinking water should see some improvement.Vehicles aren't allowed in the lane/road leading to the temple which means it's a walk of around 10 minutes.This is understandable consider space being a constraint at the entry.However please remove board saying road closed due to road work and allow vehicles to drop aged and with special needs.Shopping for small souvenirs is possible in the small street market along the path.Better arrangements for archana would be boon for devotees.Should be there on your list to visit when in Goa."
219,Shiva Temple,Awesome place. Peaceful and silent. You should go there for pray. Nice it's in South Goa best temple.
220,Nice temple !,Holy place. Very peaceful. Feel like you have visited Goa if you have visited this temple. Quite place with peaceful enchanting.
221,Peaceful and Serene,"One of the well maintained clean Temple and serene atmosphere.A must visit while at Goa. Easy approach, parking area available, disciplined devotee crowd."
222,Visiting after a decade,Nice temple to visit.We enjoyed this place very much nice place to buy hat and other items.temple surrounding is very good
223,Temple for Lord Shiva,"It’s said to have been the birth place of Smt. Lata Mangeshkar .Walk through a long street to the temple with stalls selling commodities like purses, bags, keychains, wallets ,etc. on both the sides."
224,Calm ...,"If you love to be at temples you can be here. Goa temples have a different architecture, It has been influenced by its history. Its clean and neat."
225,A great location & a serene Temple!,If you are in Goa you must visit this temple. Beautiful temple. There is a dress code for girls. They have to wear decent cloths.
226,Very beautiful and calm temple,"Peaceful temple to visit! If you're travelling from Baga, the drive till here is amazing! The roads are single way but they're beautiful!"
227,Beautiful. ,"The temple premises are very clean. The attire regulations are strictly adhered to, no shorts and vests."
228,Family deity of Indian Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar !!!,This is my favourite temple in India and nowhere else have i found more peace. The surroundings are very clean and green. Facilities are very good. We always visit this first on our yearly Goa trip.
229,"Well maintained temple, very beautiful part of South Goa, must go ","This temple is located quite far off, even further than Old Goa, but is definitely worth a visit. Good to do this temple when visiting Old Goa. As usual, the car park is far away, so visitors are to get off their vehicles at the car park and walk a certain distance. Bring your shades and hat, please! It was really hot when we were there. Plenty of sellers along the walking path, and while mentioning walking path, I should caution you about the vehicles. Why there are motorbikes and even cars zooming past in a ""walking path"" perplexes me, but this is India.The temple is has a unique architecture, with a tower looking like a pagoda. It's very clean in the temple compound. The entire visit will take you about an hour. Do take some time looking at the vendor's goods along the way. We found certain unique items and souvenirs which weren't available elsewhere in Goa. I won't mention it - see it for yourselves!"
230,temple visit,One thing I noticed here is this this temple doesn't appear like a temple. The architecture of this temple is very unique and looks like a Portuguese church. The Blue and yellow colors make it more vibrant. The shopping area near this temple is much cheaper as compared to other places in Goa
231,Unique architecture for a Hindu temple,"It's in south Goa,Ponda.we visited in my second day trip to Goa(south Goa).On the way to Shantha Durga temple.Here Lord Shiva in the form of Mangeshwara will appear."
232,The Lord resides here.....in all his power,Situated in the lush green view and nicely maintained.. a ride to revive yourself.. recommended to seek blessings from an incarnation of Lord Shiva..
233,Nice place,"It's a good place for hindu devotional followers. Nothing much on architecture of temple, it's normal."
234,Jai Bole Nath 🙏🏼,Nice religious place with peaceful environment. Wear decent clothes while going to it. Must visit for religious people.
235,"Divine experience, must visit!",Usually ppl find Goa is for beaches and churches...but Goa has got some temples as well...Mangeshi is one of them..close to 10kms from Panji and worth visiting the place!!!
236,Truly Surreal,I visited this place once in 1988 and now in 2019. No rush for Darshan. Also note shorts are not allowed to enter into the temple. They give some kind of cloth/Dhoti to wrap around and then you can enter. Its free of cost.
237,Quite and Serene Place,"It is wrong to visit an area without trying to see the sights.  It cost is 4800 rupees to hire a local taxi for a day trip covering the main sights of south Goa. This was our 3rd stop.After paying 20 rupees for the driver to park in the car park, we walked down a long road to the temple [no vehicles allowed]. This is probably because either there is nowhere to park at the temple end of the road or more likely to ensure that you run the gauntlet of the multitude of souvenir shops along the way. It really is amazing that the shop keepers have not realised that trying to shoo customers into their shops results in lost sales: No Englishman likes a hard sell and being accosted just for glancing in the direction of a shop for the briefest of micro-glimpses guarantees that we will walk on by and not dare look properly at the merchandise. The lack of a fixed price ticket and the ‘I give you best deal’ is similarly off-putting.Any way after a long walk past shops and more dehydrated women we finally reached the temple. Again impressive and lots of statues worth a look."
238,"Mangueshi Temple, Goa, an escape from beaches","The temple is nestled in the midst of hills and thick group of Coconut trees......ahead of a serene water reservoir(tala in marathi and tale in konkani).......The salubrious surroundings of the temple beckons the pilgrims for worship and stay.The temple bus stop is  located on the Panaji Margao main road and one has to walk for about 10 minutes on the cemented pathway to reach the door-step of the temple and ascend the steps enabling one to  reach the temple precincts and one finds oneself in front of the temple structure......a few steps up and one has the darshan of the Lord........who is the form of Lord Shiva (jatadhari).........The sanctum where the Lord resides has the form of a deity horizontally embedded on the floor and the morning prayers are solemnised by bathing the statue in water honey and curd.Handis full of water are poured over the small diety,drawn from the nearby well next to the Sactum santorum.In the after noon the lord dons a dress and is decorated with fragrant flowers invoking obeisance and forgiveness before the Almighty......Behind the temple resides the Mulkeshwar (shepherd) who also acts like a Gram -rakshak.whose tall statue adorns the beautifully restored temple...In the left chamber reside Santeri and Veer bhadra and in the right hall are the Laxminarayan Surya narayan and Garuda (eagle)........Legend has it that thousands of years ago in a village the village were surprised to find a cow's udders spraying an idol by the way-side with milk.......villagers surmised this as the......visit of the lord himself and placed it on a pedestal and summoned brahmins who took care of the it Chanting shlokas and mantras the Lord was bestowed upon the honour he deserved......during the portuguese rule when temples were desecrated,the temple idols were brought here to this places which was a diffcult place to reach in those days when this place was almost a thick jungle...........God was thus assigned a safer "" haven"".The families who are assigned to the God are known as mahajans and can stay in the temple premises where rooms are built in the area surrounding it.They belong to the Gauda Saraswat Brahmin  community..........most of whom stay in Maharashtra and elsewhere.I too belong to this community and feel greatly rejuvenated in the company of the Lord and Mulkeshwar that I always make an attempt to visit the temple twice a year and sek the Lord""s blessings.As we come from our journey fom bombay we have to seek dhool -bhet(one meets the lord in the same clothes as are laden with the dust of the journey) and place flowers in the large plate meant for offerings to the god....Aarti (invocation to god )is performed at 12 noon and then at10 in night. and a banana at the Mulkeshwar temple...........One normally performs abhishekha (the ritual of mantras invoking gods blessings.......On each Monday night the Lord""s palanquin is decorated with fowers of different colours and hues and with the lord ""s small idol in itthe palanquin goes around the temple carried by the mahajans in steps .The procession is led by the Secretary of the Temple Trust who is known as the Khamavisdaar.flanked on each -side by the pall-bearers.....A singer walks ahead and sings a few musical invocations to god n completion of each leg.........witnessing this  fascinating spectacle ones mind is filled with gay abandon .The ceremony is unique and one feels elated after its completion.....A canteen on the premise provides  whole some and nutriitious food and a visit to places like Mhalsa is enchanting.A way ward goan life has picked up one finds oneself in the throes of a quiet life/."
239,Great place!,"What a visually stunning place this temple is. The walk up to the temple is lined with traders huts and lined with paddy fields. The smells, sights and noises on the walk up are a prelude to a very special place of worship and serenity."
240,Har Har Mahadev ….. great feeling to be here!,"From the car parking till the entrance to the temple,there is a line of little shops where you can do shopping post visiting the temple.The temple itself is beautiful and well maintained. It is a fantastic feeling visiting the temple.darshan happens very quickly .we did not need to wait in a long queue,but got the darshan very quickly"
241,Good Temple to Visit,Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Mangeshi Temple. I did not go on an organised tour so was able to wander in my own time. Whether Hindu or not this temple is a must see as a beautiful example of the Hindu faith.
242,"Not so worth, Good for the religious people","Not many people know about this temple in Goa. But it should not be missed. A beautiful temple that blends the best of Goan architecture styles, it attracts a large number of devotees. The premises are clean and calm, far cry from the crowds and chaos one normally associates with Goa. Do not miss."
243,Nice Temple,While on our way back to Bangalore we visited the temple in the morning. It was a good drive and the temple is strategically located at a high point. There was ample parking outside so we parked and walked to the temple. There are lovely shops around for you to pick pick flowers for pooja or also shop around for unique things for collection. The temple was pleasant and serene and there was a medium crowd. We got the darshan in few minutes as the queue was not long. The place has a lovely view around.Outside the temple there are shops serving fresh cut fruits which is awesome and has a good variety. Overall a good place to visit during your stay in Goa.Time at the Temple - 20-30 minutes ( Incase you choose to do a special pooja it will take addl time)
244,Mangeshi Temple!!!,On the way to Dhudhsagar so if you are visiting Dhudhsagar then can include otherwise skip this place
245,Good Lord Shiva Temple,"We had to go a bit far looking for this temple but once we reached there found it so serene and so beautiful. It is very old temple and connected to Goan History. Contrary to my belief the place is not owned by Lata Mangeshkar Family but about 12 families made this temple. They have a canteen also that serves very nice, home made food on very subsidized rates. We had meal there as well."
246,interesting,"Said to have power of getting your wishes fulfilled !! A medium size temple , Well kept and orderly systems"
247,A must visit temple,While taking a tour of South Goa this is one of the place where you will have to visit. This belongs to Lord Shiva and is said to be where lata Mangeshkar belongs. The temple is well laid out. I wish they had made good arrangements for carpet to walk on the hot stone in summer.
248,Mangeshi Temple!!!,This is one of the most visited place in Goa and is considered as one of the top tourism spots in Goa ... car parking is very far but the market area  helps cover the distance with fun ...
249,"Mangeshi temple, good to be and to stay","Just a relaxing place to visit spread over a good area Felt at peace ... when we visited the deity Has a history which it can boast of , built in very unique style the deep stambhs in all goan temples are very uniqiue in nature"
250,Historical Divine Place in the HEART of Nature.,"visit this temple if you are a devout , religious person, The temple itself does not offer anything outstanding in terms of architecture or spiritual atmosphere. When I had visited the temple last time, it was crowded and did not bring around spiritual feeling normally one would expect."
251,Mangeshi temple,"This place is very spiritual. You can feel it with all your senses. After that, down there is a very good suk. Check there a coconut out."
252,Nice temple of lord shiva,"Too sunny and have to walk in hot sun and hot walking path! Since it is an emotional touch of God, had to visit, but not that worth a 100 year old temple and I dont think everyone has to visit this place"
253,Best temple with scenic beauty,"We visited the temple around 12.30 pm and the sun was too hot. As we entered the premises, we found the temple so beautiful. We removed and kept our shoes in the designated place and walked barefoot towards the temple. We couldn't walk on the floor as the entire place was too hot due to heat of the sun and there was no cover to get shade. We got blisters under the feet after waiting in the sun to enter into the santum sanctorum. We prayed and came out and literally ran towards the place where our shoes were kept. Pls avoid going with small children in the afternoon to the temple. Best time is morning and evening. Temple authorities could provide a shelter where devotees wait to enter into the sanctum sanctorum."
254,Nothing much to see except temple,"Who knew Goa has such a beautiful temple. Since I went to Goa with my family, I took my parents to Mangeshi Temple. The temple is huge and not very crowded. It is quite famous also. Nice break from the usual beaches and shacks. Goa has everything and is for everyone!"
255,Mangeshi pranam,"Right as one gets down and starts walking towards the temple, its a different feeling.On one side there are commercial shops and vendors, on the other a narrow path way which is quiet... as we climb the steps and move, we can wash our feet and then move to the outer yard and then get into the temple. What vibrations as we enter..was crowded as it was the festival time. May be at othe times you do not need to walk as much, can drive closer to the temple."
256,Religious duty!,"visited around 12 noon. Beautiful, clean and calm temple. Good shopping options on the way from parking to temple. Finished the darshan in 30 min. Even lunch option is available for pilgrims who are interested. Very easy to locate and famous one. Good temple."
257,100 year old temple!,"Divine feeling, calm and peaceful experience since we reached in the late afternoon. A beautiful chariot outside temple added to good view."
258,Beautiful and well maintained temple,It was neat and clean and well managed queue system for the attractive Darshana of Lord for the prayers with peaceful mind
259,"Bhagavan Manguesh, an incarnation of Shiva.",Worth visiting. Its quite a long walk from the car park & can be uncomfortable in the hot sun. Temple is kept clean & does not seem very commercial.
260,Serene Temple at its best ,"while visiting old goa you may consider adding Mangeshi temple on to your list off sites to visit, i believe it was less then 30 minutes away by car.depending on your religion the visit to the temple will be short or longer :) for me it was quite short :) seen temples i consider more interesting in India"
261,"Beautiful, Clean & Well Maintained...",Easy access. Must visit for blessings. Good options for shopping Goan memorabilia at reasonable rates outside the temple.
262,good temple,"If you love to deviate from beaches in Goa for a change, do reach at Mangueshi temple. The temple is dedicated to Lord Mangursh, believed to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva. The temple is a beautiful structure with a striking color.  It has a magnificent water tank. The architectural style of the building is in tune with the Christian style. The place is calm and neat."
263,Temple or business place??,This is a very impressive and 'pretty' temple and easily accessible by taxi to visit - it was more refined than some that we visited and we were pleased that we got to see this one.
264,What a peaceful temple between green hills.,This was a second visit to our family deity. We were lucky to be there for the afternoon Aarti. The security guards inside the temple were very rude to devotees and with the priests shout if you stand in front of the deity for a bit longer. This does make the experience unpleasant.
265,Worth visiting,We were dropped in the car park its about a 10 minute walk through the market stores.The temple is really  beautiful and clean plenty of people going in to pray.
266,Great old temple in south goa,"Very clean compound surrounded by lush green vegetation! A beautiful spiritual experience! Cars do not go all the way,one has to walk down for 10 minutes to reach the temple. Roadside vendors sell local food and delicacies. From local sweets to snacks this place offers everything."
267,Good Shiva temple with very old history,"I visit with my family regularly, beautiful temple, they served a pure veg authentic food on the chargeable basis"
268,a nice temple for the spiritually inclined,Excellent place to have a good Darshan. Busy and crowded. Infrastructure is requiring improvement. Too much construction is not helping the beauty of the location.  The walk to the temple from the small shops was full of crowd.
269,"Scorching heat, burning feet.., but a traditional retreat!",This is a nice place to visit if you are a religious traveler & is interested in covering places other than beach & booze. The temple is strict about clicking pictures inside the main arena.They have rooms to stay which they lend out only to its members.You will find a lot of people coming there to offer special prayers who will be sitting with the Hindu priest inside the temple
270,GOA Ancient Temple,"Temple is located far away from busy city traffics,long walk to reach from parking lot,window shooping till temple entrance,temple is specious and historicalprovides accomidation around temple for piligrimages"
271,Bless !!!,"It is definitely worth visiting a few of the temples in the Ponda area. Even if you aren't interested in taking darshan of the deity, the typical architectural style of these Goan temples is something special to see."
272,Need to make sure that you act smartly with Shopkeepers outside the temple,"Nicely done temple , feels nostalgic when entered , The facility management is good . The market outside is worth visiting , The temple itself has soothing effect & can be visited at any point during the year , The strange part is four doors between the diety & people outside . The distance is not god for people to take darshan of the deity inside ."
273,Bliss,The place is good and nice to have a visit.It is a nice place and good time pass.It is maintained well.
274,Divine place...,off old goaa nice temple with a different sort of idolpeaceful place with no crowdsdo go if u are spititually inclined
275,One of goas oldest temple.,Very well maintained templeQuick and easy DarshanDivine vibrations inside.Attractive Deity!!!Security personnel allowed our car inside on request.
276,Must Visit,it was good to see a temple well maintained ...but the priests here are completely commercialised ...the idol looks really divine
277,Fantastic Spiritual Experience,"You park your vehicle a bit away from the temple. The road has stally selling curios on the side. Lots of shops also sell eatables and Cashews of Goa and other dry fruits. As you approch the temple you find ladies selling offerings of flowers, coconut and other requires containts. As you climb the stairs to the temple courtyard, as Hindu tradion requires, you remove your shoes and wall towards the temple. Temple is big enough to accommodate many visitors. There wer two priest offering teerth to visitors. Visitors had a darshan of Mangueshi God as written on boards of the tample. Its a shiva temple and it is adorned in Silver metals. Its is the main daity from the trinity of Gods, i.e. Bramha, Vishnu and mahesh. This is quiet different from Christinity concept of trinity."
278,nice place to visit,Located at a nice place. We have to move arround 700 meters to visit that place. For old people it is difficult to move. The gaurd is not so co-operative to elderly.
279,Gods of the Singer,I did not find this temple extraordinary to come all the way to visit this. It was like any other temple. My suggestion is visit this place only if you want visit a temple and not for any monumental visit.
280,Best food canteen,"As mentioned in title, from the place you leave the chappal stand, feet is upto a burning retreat. You'll surely not enjoy the sun at his high. There should be a way to lay carpets or so to walk OK, than limping with burning feet!!Camera not allowed inside. So be careful if u get snatched inside, if onYou should visit only because it is an old temple in GOA!"
281,Lord Shiva's temple,"Every time I go to Goa, I make it a point to visit this temple and every time I visit here, I find it amazing how new it feels. Apart from occasional bells being run by the visiting devotees, this place ends up being a vortex of soul searching; at least for me."
282,Lord Shiva's Temple.,nice temple. tourist are required to ware outfits to cover knee. entry is not permitted if your outfit is shouter than knee.
283,One of the few old temples in Goa,"After getting down at parking area, take a short walk to temple compound. On the way there are shops selling souvenirs, idols and other things – reasonable priced. Females with shorts & skirts or short clothes are not allowed inside, they are asked to cover themselves – trust’s office provides “Duppata or Lungi” type cloth free of charge to cover the body. Even if you opt for for a half a day day tour of old Goa, the taxy drivers will take you to this temple.Overall, the atmosphere inside is very peaceful and location is picturesque. As we learnt, it is a famous Konkani Temple. The temple is very neat, clean and very well maintained."
284,"Peace of Mind, Guaranteed.....",It was Blissfull Day but it was bit long Journey because we started traveling from South Goa after Covering Old Goa we reached Mangeshi temple around 3:00Pm It was too hot and mudy air all around.

286,Mangeshi Temple,"Ladies with unusual dresses exposing the body too much is not allowed. You can buy a formal dhoti kind of a thing to cover, for rent. The vehicle must be parked at a distance and walk quite a bit. The temple is neat and clean. There is a place to keep your chappals"
287,Nice,"the temple is nice.guides are terrible.you will be asked to remove your shoes to enter the temple, but the ground is extremely dirty.monkeys could be seen around the temple.the small market leading to the temple is nice (few shops where you can bargain to get good prices for souvenirs)"
288,Spiritual Goa,Temple was very good. Only thing which I don't like was if you pay high amount as donation then you can pray close to the god otherwise stay outside where all the general people stays. Its like they are sitting there to earn money.
289,Best temple in Goa,"I think I really like temples :DEach temple I went was sth joyful for me.This was a great one too.We bought flowers.walking with no footwear, eat and drink the pastry and water and done what locals were doing :D Dress properly Worth a visit"
290,Om Namay Shivay,"Travelling with a group of 43 senior Citizens, we visited this temple arround 12.30 PM. After climbing about 10-12 steps, we hit the main entrrance. At the entry point, there is Bharoan temple. It's very satisfying to have blessings of the Lord. Within the temple complex, we see a high white tower, called the Garuda stambh, which is yet another attraction at the Temple complex."

It is at a distance of 1 km from Mardol close to Nagueshi, 21 km from Panaji the capital of Goa, and 26 km from Margao. This temple is one of the largest and most frequently visited temples in Goa. In 2011, the temple along with others in the area instituted a dress code on visitors of the temple. This temple had its origins in Kushasthali Cortalim, a village in murmugao which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. In the year 1560, when the Portuguese started Christian conversions in mormugao taluka, the Saraswats of Vatsa Gotra moved the Mangesh Linga from the original site at the Kushasthali or Cortalim on the banks of river Zuari  to its present location at Mangeshi in Priol village of Atrunja Taluka, which was then ruled by the Hindu kings of Sonde of Antruz Mahal (Ponda), to be more secure Since the time of the shifting, the temple has been rebuilt and renovated twice during the reign of the Marathas and again in the year 1890. The final renovation occurred in the year 1973 when a golden kalasha (holy vessel) was fitted atop the tallest dome of the temple.  The original site was a very simple structure, and the current structure was only built under Maratha rule, some 150 years after it had been moved. The main temple is dedicated to Bhagavan Manguesh, an incarnation of Shiva. Bhagavan Mangesh is worshipped here as Shiva linga.  He is the kuldevta of many Goud Saraswat Brahmins. The 450-year-old Shri Mangesh temple dedicated to Shiva stands out with its simple and yet exquisitely elegant structure. The temple architecture consists of several domes, pilasters and balustrades. There is a prominent Nandi Bull and a beautiful seven-story deepstambha (lamp tower), which stands inside the temple complex. The temple also has a magnificent water tank, which is believed to be the oldest part of the temple.  The Sabha Griha is a spacious hall which accommodates over 500. Like most temples in Goa, Mangueshi Temple has a large number of pujas being performed daily. Every morning, Shodshopchar pujas, namely Abhisheka, Laghurudra and Maharudra, are performed. This is followed by Maha-Aarti at noon and Panchopchar pooja at night. Every Monday, the idol of Manguesh is taken out for a procession in the Palakhi accompanied by music before the evening Aarti."
293,Calm amd Serene,"I visited the temple on a taxi guided tour. It is important to experience, or at least see, some of the religious life of Goa. It was interesting but not particularly peaceful or inspiring. Visit if you haven't visited a Hindu temple before, but you can skip it if you have been to one before........assuming you are not Hindu. Then you will surely want to visit."
294,Awesome temple,"we viewed this on the way back from the falls, at the base they have stalls it is up a little hill, it was quite busy.... and the views were wonderful"
295,Beautiful temple dedicated to Lord Shiva,Temple is good...Very less crowd... Its on hill top... need not worry to climb ... No need to purchase prasad thali from outside.... they will try to loot you... be careful of cheaters
296,A Relic of Goa's Pre Colonial Heritage,"beautiful structure, neat and clean, but crowdy. lots of people visit everyday.. Wont get much peace.."
297,Awesome temple,"It was good to see this place, but I was lucky enough to see places like this in Thailand earlier this year, and this place just does not compare.  It was not as architecturally impressive, and the historical information provided was scant.  But it was cool to see."
298,Good rooms in the Mutt,The walk up a flight of stairs is worth it when you see these beautiful buildings.  The colours are spectacular.  Entry requires removing shoes.
299,Beautiful temple,"It was a long drive from our hotel, but it was v peaceful being at the temple for the short time that we were there.... This is my third visit to the temple....feel good everytime I come here...."
