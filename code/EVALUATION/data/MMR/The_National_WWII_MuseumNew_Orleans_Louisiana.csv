0,A Must See,The WWII Museum is very well done and they keep adding more. I have been there two years in a row and still would keep going back. It is a must see if in NOLA!
1,Greedy wankers.,I have worked in museums and visited museum around the world and this is the best one I’ve ever seen. Fabulous exhibit made me cry. So thorough. Make sure you have the whole day to look around. The cafe is good too. We shopped at the gift shop too which was excellent.
2,Excellent,"Went to this Museum and spent a whole day here, I must say it was amazing.  So much information and wonderful displays. If you have a chance to go I would make sure you take the time."
3,Best museum I’ve visited ,"I had a fantastic experience at the WWII museum. The movie ""Beyond All Boundaries"" was phenomenal and the exhibits provided facts and testaments that gave me a new perspective on the war. I have been to many museums focused on the Holocaust aspect, but I had never been to one that showed the American soldier's perspective of the war.I especially appreciated the exhibit on the brave Japanese American soldiers who fought for the United States even though some of their families were in internment camps.I spent five hours at the museum and time flew by. I would highly recommend this museum to anyone."
4,Amazing,I have been here several times and every time I am happy I came.  The place is clean and the people are great.  It is worth every dollar. I have come here several times and every time I learn something new.  The place is huge and if you visit you might want to make sure that you at least give yourself a half a day to really enjoy what the museum has to offer.  The road to Berlin was my favorite.
5,Wow!  Worth a visit.,"This museum is simply amazing!  My wife and I really enjoyed visiting.  The museum is broken  up by different buildings and levels.  The aircraft and other WWII items are truly stunning.  There are several interpretive stories, lots of WWII era items to view, and personal stories of servicemembers who served in the war.  This is an absolute must-see museum!"
6,Amazing!!!,This museum just keeps getting better and better. Even my two teenagers loved it and learned so much.
7,Fist time visit to Museum ,I am a veteran and wanted to see the museum. i was told I have to stop and visit. WOW what a great place. The 4D theater was AWESOME and the exhibits where unbelievable. The story's from the troops that were over in the WWII theater stole our hearts. A word to the wise it will take more than 2 days if you want to grasp the entire museum.
8,History ,"This is a really good museum.  Well thought out and well planned.  We were able to go through the basic part of the museum in one long afternoon.  There are other options as well for what to see, which cost more, but we decided to go with the basic.  So well worth the time and the trip.  Fascinating look into WWII."
9,Good addition to a trip,"This museum is packed with so much information! I am particularly interested in WWII history so of course I loved it but I think it would be worth visiting even if you aren't. I recommend planning out your visit since there is so much to see. Definitely don't miss the building with all the airplanes. The museum is open with reduced capacity, social distancing guidelines, and extra cleaning. Take this into consideration when planning your visit and buy tickets online before you go if possible."
10,National WWII Museum,This is one of the best museums I have ever been to. It is PACKED with great stories and interactive displays. Plan for an entire day if you want to see everything.
11,Amazing Museum,"My wife and I were amazed at the National WWII Museum. The multimedia experience was very well designed and involving. The videos of servicemen and women in action, oral histories of real veterans and informative descriptive displays were outstanding. Highly recommended when visiting NOLA."
12,Lovely,My husband and I spent the day in the museum. It is very well done and very informative. I loved the dog tag experience!
13,Great venue and staff.,"This is one of the best museums we have ever visited.  The displays were vivid and disturbing, as the effects were like I've never seen.  I would highly recommend this museum to anyone that respects learning about the events that lead to WWII and beyond."
14,Must See when in New Orleans,"I loved this museum. I spent 10 hours there one day and wanted to go back. I’m a history nerd and this place did not disappoint. If visiting NO, this place is a must."
15,Excellent!  Plan to spend a solid 4 to 5 hours here! ,"We spent 2 days touring the WWII Museum and probably could have spent another day too!  Very well done and laid out.  Staff were fantastic, facility was spotless and very aware of COVID prevention,  There was a special exhibit on glass collected from Europe's churches and made into are that was fantastic.  They had a European, Pacific and another special wing that were superb.  We did not do the 4D movie - kinda wishing now we had.  Did get a $2 off coupon and then the 2nd day back was $7.  A must see when in New Orleans!"
16,A Must Visit !,"We visited the museum on a Saturday and it was quite crowded. However, the museum itself is wonderful. There is so much information, many videos and hands-on activities, and various items to see. They have special exhibits and full size aircraft hanging from the ceilings—there is a video that explains how they did it. We allotted one day for the museum, but could have used at least another half day to see everything. We felt a little rushed going through the last areas. We are so glad we made time to go and highly recommend it. There is a restaurant there, but we brought snacks and bottled water so we didn’t have to carve out time to eat. We saw several other people who also brought their own snacks and drinks."
17,Incredible museum,"The National WW11 Museum in New Orleans   is  simply AMAZING . My husband and I were  there the whole day   it's Humbling, so well documented,fantastic exhibits ,The building itself is an  architectural delight ..best museum we have ever visited  ."
18,I didn't know how much I didn't know about WWII,"This was one of the best museums I've been to.  The design was amazing.  Anyone, history/WW2 buff or not, could spend all day in there.  Plus, in September it's Air Conditioned and Air Conditioned well lol.  100% recommend the 4D movie as well.  Maybe start with it, we did it towards the end and it more recapped what we read for 4 hours.  But it's interactive and very well done.  Amazing museum and definitely don't miss!"
19,I learned so much,"One of the best museum experiences I have had.  So much information, presented well; the 4D movie was amazing.  Everyone should have it on their ""must do"" list."
20,Incredible experience ,"I thought this museum would be about WWII, but what it really is is a museum about the people who fought in WWII. It did not glorify the war, but did a fantastic job explaining and describing the war. I visited with two teenage girls. We watched the Tom Hanks movie first-which a highly recommend. It helped put everything into order and perspective. We then went to the floor with the European  information. There is a lot to read and see. You could just walk through and just take an hour-but don't! You could also take hours and really take your time and read and learn. Because of the age of my children, I based our pace on their attention level. We had a fantastic lunch at the museum restaurant and it was very good! (and affordable!) The we visited the South Pacific area. We walked to a different building and looked at the planes, etc. We ended our day with ice cream and the time period soda shop. This is something you should do!"
21,A Must Visit,our biggest mistake was not scheduling enough time to see the whole museum. My friend is a history buff and even he learned a bunch.
22,Worth Every Penny,"This is a wonderful museum everyone should visit.  Spent two days there, and could have spent more.  So much to admire about our Fathers and Grandfathers.  The sacrifices they and their families made to assure us of freedom is hard to comprehend."
23,Overwhelming,We love any type of history museum but this was really an exceptional one. The layout is very good. Had no ideal there would be so much reading and video presentations. Our mistake was to only plan for one day here. It would definitely take two full days to see and heare everything that is here.
24,One the very best museums of WWII!,"Being a Veteran, this was very important for me to see.  They took great care and time putting this magnificent museum together.  Bring to life the actual people and places that encompassed WWII and life on the home front.  I loved being able to see more than just the Uncle Sam and Rosie the Riveter posters, and the stories behind the items shown in the museum.  Well worth the visit!"
25,Best thing to do in NOLA - a must see!!!,"We are so glad we had time to visit this vast museum.   So much to see and learn.   The volunteers are delightful.   One thing we enjoyed so much was collecting a ""dog tag"" each and following a US army personnel through their experience during the conflict and how they settled after WWII.   Brilliant.   To see it all you will need all day.  We were recommended to certain areas as only had 3.5 hours.  well worth it."
26,Amazing display if WWII history,This is a wonderful place to visit.  We've been 3 times and will go again.  There are always new things to see!
27,Amazing museum for anyone!,"My second time there. I spent 5 hours with a 30 min lunch brake. So many things to see.I had my wife, who is not a history buff, but she was not bored and learned a lot about the WWII. She was surprised how divided was the country before the war.How many people were against any ""foreign wars"".I think it is the best museum on WWII. They have surprising things, like a kitchen and a house during the war time with typical appliances, food and furniture. A lot of information on converting the civil factories into military, etc."
28,Over Seven Hour Later,"It is a must see if you are interested in history at all. We visited probably 15 years ago and they have made it even better, The way things are displayed just adds to the experience."
29,Excellent,"This was an amazing museum, one of the best I've been to. I'm not a huge museum buff, or a history buff, but this was a very elaborate and personal experience that I think every American should see. Packed with artifacts, and personal stories, it's impossible not to feel moved by this place. I can only go to museums for about 3-4 hours at a time before I reach my intake limit, but that only covered about 1/3 of the campus. I would totally go back again to learn more."
30,The greatest generation ,"This was our second trip to the museum, the last being about three years ago.  My how it's grown!This is the most comprehensive installation of WW II stories and memorabilia one could imagine.  The addition of the Boeing gallery, with suspended vintage versions of the great WW II aircraft, is not to be missed!One realizes the sacrifices of the entire country and of specific men and women as they fought against great evil.  It honors folks like our parents and our uncle (who gave his life in Germany 2 weeks before wars end).  Every one who contributed to this effort - on battlefield, in hospitals, on ships and planes - is a hero, and the WW II museum honors them magnificently!Don't miss it, and bring your entire family!  Note: It is great for kids, but they should be at least age 12 to have a sense of the history.  Some exhibits are explicit, with film and photography of harsh events."
31,Awesome,I have three boys ages 11-14.  They love history.  We do museums.  Have been to the WWI museum in Kansas City twice because they love it so much and that is the only thing we have done twice as a family who loves road trips.  All five of us agreed this was the best museum we have ever been to.  We spent 6 hours including lunch.  Lunch was pretty good for felt it was a bit pricey.  I think we probably missed some exhibits.  I wished I had had a map with all the nooks and crannies to make sure we got as much as we could.  The staff is outstanding.  It’s really interactive.  I highly recommend to watch the movie.  We got tickets online for 9:15 then movie at 10:00 and that worked out well.  Parking is across the street and very reasonable for the area.  We paid $14 for 3-7 hours of parking.  That’s all I’m going to say so not to spoil it.  Do this.
32,First visit on the schedule and the BEST!,This is a must see for anyone who treasures our military history.  We took our 50 year old kids and they were captivated by the information and riveting story of the two WWII theatres. I wish we had gone for two days to take more time and do more experiences.  We did the submarine ride and Beyond All Boundaries and with the European and Asian tours we had a very full day.
33,"If WWII is your thing, a must do",Visited the museum there is so much that all could not be seen in one visit.  I love how they have the dog tags and that you can follow an individual as he/she travels throughout the war and talks about their experiences.  The volunteers were especially helpful in helping us determine what we wanted to see and do.  They gave us great directions after asking us what we were interested in due to the limited time we had there.  Highly recommend visiting and great learning experience for anyone.
34,A New Orleans must do,Very informative and interactive museum. It took us about 3 hours to visit the museum and we both left with a better understanding of the war.
35,Very emotional & educational,I go to this Museum every time I visit New Orleans. Many interesting exhibits spread out over several buildings. If you are a history buff you will spend at least a whole day there. You can eat at the Canteen at the Museum or walk to restaurants near by.
36,Wow,"I can’t say enough about this museum, it’s amazing.  I have an 8 yo and two 6 yo boys and we needed 2 days.  It’s a lot for younger kids who can’t read but tons of interactive spots where they can listen and lots of videos!  We felt it was better to break it up and do a few hours one day and a few the 2nd it’s a lot to take in.  We loved the 4D movie and the Sub experience.  The volunteers and WWII veterans are really what make this place special so many dedicated people with so much knowledge there, it was a real treat and I hope to come back for an adult only visit, but my kids want to come back as well!"
37,Very Informative and Entertaining ,"We have been to New Orleans several times and were looking for something to do besides eat and drink. The museum was a good choice. The displays and films are first rate. But by the time we got through the War in the Pacific, we were about worn out. Maybe we will check out the European section on our next visit."
38,A day in the museum,"I love visiting museums, so when  I was in New Orleans, I had to visit The National WWII Musuem. Unfortunately, I went at 2:30pm during Spring Break, so everything was sold out. When I went to purchase the tickets for my friend and I, we were told over 4,000 people had visited the museum so far that day. That being said the museum was very crowded so my travel companion and I were not able to fully enjoy the museum like we normally would. It is an amazing museum with five different buildings and five different gift shops. Every staff member we encountered were friendly and genuinely glad that visitors were there. I would definitely plan on going early in the day to get tickets to special showings or activities and to thoroughly go through each exhibit."
39,Great Experience,We only had 2.5 hours and it was not enough. This museum is truly a must do in New Orleans and we all need to realize the sacrifices and heroism of so many people world wide during WWII. We cannot forgot what so many men and women fought for and  the freedom so many gave their lives for. Don't miss the Airplane room at the end- just breathtaking
40,Best museum I’ve seen ,We have been wanting to visit this museum for a long time. We finally made it and it did not disappoint! Exhibits were so well done. Movies throughout helped you to learn so much! The movie Tom Hanks narrates is a must! We had lunch that was delicious. Excellent service throughout!
41,Huge and Awesome!,"We visited on a Saturday morning; the museum is a must-see.  Clean, well laid out, detailed.  You could spend hours there (which unfortunately we did not have).  It is well worth the entry fee.  Very itneresting and an excellent representation of our history."
42,Outstanding museum,My family and I spent more than 4 hours touring this museum and loved every minute of it. The museum was well organized and masterfully put together. We paid the extra fee to watch the Beyond All Boundaries movie and weren’t disappointed.  I highly recommend this museum but give yourself ample time so you can appreciate everything there is to see.
43,Well done; worth the time you have,We really enjoyed the exhibits at the National WWII Museum. The dog tag you get to start the tour was a great personal touch. We only spent a few hours but felt very moved by all we saw and learned.
44,Amazing,"I am not a war buff, but found lots of amazing stuff in this museum.  We watched most of the movie experiences and were impressed.  The stories and niches really help personalize the WWII experience."
45,Highly Recommend!,It is a Great Museum. The staff are very nice and made it a great day. Yes plan on a whole day as there is a lot of history. Every child needs to see what these Great Veterans did for our Country.
46,Ok,"The WWII museum (also called the D Day museum) is one of the most interesting, organized museums I have ever experienced. Don't miss this important site!"
47,Do not miss the movie,"Absolutely amazing.  Probably the best museum I have visited.  To take in all theatres on show to the max will require more than a day but well worth it.  Central making it a great location, it is a must do on the list when visiting New Orleans."
48,Outstanding Exhibits and Humbling,WOW.... We spent 4 hours here.  Everything is awesome.  Great for kids and even I learned something more.  I talked with WW2 Veterans for over 1/2 hour.  Loved them.  Sooooo much to see. Words can't express the overwhelming experience.  Intense and humble.  Don't miss this one.
49,Kinda boring. Hard to find the path. Not kid friendly.,Perfect museum for history buffs! We enjoyed visiting the museum. Very well organized and so much history here!
50,Love this place!!!,"I visited with my Husband and we were the youngest couple there by probably 40 years but we had an amazing time.  The food was served buffet style and was great!  Also, we visited the museum and this by far has been my favorite of the dozens I've visited in the US."
51,Worth the visit,Awesome museum covering everything about WWII. This museum was done very well and has personal stories of enlisted men. I definitely recommend this museum.
52,Well worth the visit every time.,"I could have spent 6 hours touring the campus, there is so much to take in here. It is amazingly put together with audio and visuals that really immerse you an quite the experience. Give yourself LOTS of time to tour this, you won't regret it!"
53,Parking problem,"This museum is fantastic.  In my opinion it was designed with the same thoughtfulness and quality as the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC.   There is so much to see in each exhibit, it’s a bit overwhelming.  Plan at least half a day, if not a full day to visit this wonderful site and enjoy!"
54,THE Best WW2 Museum! ,"To see this museum fully, you need to take two days.  We went as a birthday outing and the time just flew by.  Sad to say, we forget about this spectacular venue all the time.  Blame it on being a local.  It is now five buildings!  Upon realizing what we still needed to see, we became members.  Our next outing is already on the calendar.  See the movie.  Next trip, we are going on the submarine experience."
55,Great museum,"You never stop learning something new at the WWII Museum.  The visual and audio displays are great.  The combination of material, data and personal accounts gives you a feeling of being there.  The dog tag experience adds to that journey.  The 4D movie cemented things together.  Word of advise to any one going, set aside plenty of  time, my wife and I only got to see a fraction of the displays. We will go back again when we return to New Orleans."
56,December 2019,"This is a wonderful daytime diversion. The museum is huge and full of info on all things WW2. It has artifacts, movies, interactive kiosks, realistic “sets”, vehicles, and so much more. There were 4 adults in our group. It took us around 4 hours, and I’m sure we didn’t see everything. Definitely worth a visit if you have the time. If you are driving, park in their parking garage. It’s nice, clean, and inexpensive!"
57,History that time should not forget,Great museum and very very interesting.  We could have spent two or three days going through it.  It is great way to get the feel of this war.
58,Well worth the visit,"We opted for a one day ticket and were able to see a good chunk of the museum. We visited in March 2020 during the Coronavirus scare so all the interactive touch screens had been turned off, but there was still plenty to see. We thought the museum was a nice blend of historical artifacts, stuff to read, and videos to watch. The 4D movie narrated by Tom Hanks is well worth the money. You can easily spend a full day here. The sit down restaurant inside was pretty good!"
59,Such an amazing museum.,We spent all day at the museum.   I am not a huge history fan but was so amazed at this place.   A must see!
60,Great displays and entertainment.,"This was so good we went back the next day to see more.  A good history accounting of WWII, good gift store, some of the staff was not friendly when a question was asked of them regarding Teacher support information, that they were unaware about."
61,Amazing museum and architecture,Great museum. Separates the two campaign in Europe and the pacific. Was great for my kids to see. When we left I asked my son what what was the generation called that fought the war. The greatest generation and now you know why. They truly sacrificed for us. I hope it wasn’t in vain.
62,Wonderful day trip,"This is the most incredible history museum I have been too. Every exhibit immerses you in the sights, sounds, and first hand accounts of the events before and during the war. We were there for 6 hours and did not get to see everything. I highly recommend planning to go for 2 visits. It is worth it."
63,Great but parking terrible,"Since my father was an infantryman in WWII, visiting the museum was quite an emotional experience.  I feel that every American should visit this tribute to our nation's greatest generation.  I would like to return to New Orleans specifically to visit the WWII Museum."
64,Must do in NOLA,"This is an excellent museum, it’s very large and very well kept. Be ready to spend some time because this is not a quick in & out to get the most of your visit. The movie “Beyond All Boundries” is an absolute must see!! The airplane exhibit was great too."
65,So much to see,Go see this.  We were there for 1 day and you really needed 2.  So informative.  This museum will have you going through all kinds of emotions.
66,Absolutely incredible.,"A must do museum!  It this an absolutely amazing museum.  Even with COVID guidelines we had a wonderful visit and movie at the end is, in my opinion, a great way to end your visit."
67,Historical and Knowledge,A true adventure in time! Wonderful job with this exhibit and will be eager to see other exhibits they add in the future! Road to Berlin really good. Glad they have so many personal stories as well!
68,Very interesting museum,Great musem.  Gets better everytime we go.  The interactive parts were closed for Corona but it was good never the less.
69,Everyone should visit/,"We were told by several friends to visit this museum and they were right! This is not your typical museum. There are so many artifacts, stories from soldiers, videos, visuals, etc. Very interactive for the entire family. Definitely plan to spend 4 hours. We didn't get to attend a movie bc we were short on time. Will definitely go back."
70,History Buffs,"Unfortunately, my husband and I could only spend the morning at the museum. The museum is one of the best in the US. I was pleasantly surprised by people of all ages in attendance, as I thought erroneously that only baby boomers whose parents fought in WWII would be interested."
71,Terribly Disappointing,"This museum is amazing. I recommend it 100%. It is full of history, interactive. One of the best I've visited. It is a huge museum so go prepared to walk , comfortable shoes.Very well recreated and for sure a Must go see in New Orleans."
72,Worth every minute,My husband and I love ww2 history so we thought we needed to give this place a visit. We mistakenly did not account for enough time. I wish we could’ve stayed here longer as there’s so much to see! We were kind of on a time crunch so we crammed as much into the trip as possible but what an amazing museum. I need to go back!
73,Great collection and interactive content.,"Great museum! Should be in Washington DC, but so glad it was in NOLA when we visited. Great exhibits, lots of videos for those who don't want to read every plaque. A real gem."
74,"Great Museum, skip the movie","A very educational and moving experience at the WWII Museum. A vast amount of Powerful   information about WWII.  A great history lesson for those who are young and know very little about the sacrifice and hardships endured by ""the greatest generation"" Worth every penny !!! Make sure you see the Tom Hanks presentation."
75,Excellent exhibit ,"All who havent seen the ravers of WWII should go! The displays, stories and presentations are top quality. The museum tells it like it was. There is much original footage of many of the campaigns. The trials and challenges met by the men and women who fought for our freedom during that time are well chronicled. To find out just how close the allies were to losing was eye opening. This is a fine exhibit to let all of us know just how gruesome and harrowing their experiences were and how hard it was for our allied troops in the fight against the tyranny of the day."
76,Wonderful Museum,"This is one of the best curated museums (of any kind) I've ever visited.  Along with my 20-something kids, I found myself educated and moved and changed.  The museum provides a variety of learning experiences -- some quite sensory -- to keep visitors engaged.  The docents were also top-notch."
77,Should be called D-Day Museum,The staff and exhibits were great. The place is rather small but the presentation was more than expected.
78,Fantastic Museum about WWII presenting the real difficult history,Really well curated museum with so many things to see!  I highly recommend the movie as it is well worth the time and expense.  So many areas to explore and so much history to see.  If you are in NOLA you need to make this a priority to visit.
79,You should take time to visit this,"I am retired military and am obsessed with the WWII era of history. Have read an obscene amount of books on this era so coming here was an amazing way to see a lot of WWII artifacts first hand. The collection of items in this museum is second to none. The personnel who work there are over the top helpful and polite. Definitely schedule your whole day for the museum, there’s sooooo much to see! Highly recommend!!"
80,"So much information, beautifully and organized so well!",A bit overwhelming but lots of great exhibits and war artifacts. You’ll need to invest a lot if time to take in everything. The movie experience was fine but to be honest the opening D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan had a much more profound effect on me for a war experience.
81,"Loved the Special Exhibit , Remembered Light: Glass Fragments from WWII","The museum has a lot of really well done content. We did not take either of the optional movies/experiences, but the basic museum, which is quite big. We spent about 3 hours walking through the exhibits. The main track walks you through the war in Europe and then in the Pacific. There are lots of artifacts with well written descriptions interspersed with short (3-5 min) videos with good historical film, maps and narration. A lot of personal experiences of soldiers and others added context and understanding. I would not rate this as the #2 museum in the country, but it is very good and a worthwhile visit while in New Orleans."
82,Overwhelmed/underwhelmed,"We've visited many military museums and was not expecting too much of a museum in New Orleans.  Boy, was I wrong.  The volunteers provide incredible insight into the airplanes and what the soldiers experienced.  A movie narrated by Tom Hanks was probably the best documentary I've seen, especially since it was 4D....complete with chairs that vibrated, sound effects, flashing lights and holograms.  Too intense for young children but an special experience, even if you're not a WWII war buff."
83,An Amazing Museum,Excellent museum. Very modern and makes a real afford to capture some of the atmosphere the various theatres of war had. Captures some of the many human stories of heroism and sorrow.
84,Awesome experience,"My 15 year old history buff loved this museum .  We spent 4 1/2 hours and only got through about a 1/3 of the exhibits.  We did watch the movie, which took up about an hour.  Great gift shops throughout the museum.  Buy tickets online to avoid long lines during peak times."
85,Breath taking,"When I retire, I’m volunteering here. Love this place!!! Locals like me come here all the time. Love the history and authenticity of it."
86,an absolute must-see!,"Easily one of the best and most comprehensive museums I've visited.  My brother had recommended it, and I'm so glad he did.  My husband and best friend and I had an amazing time there - we just wish we had longer, as there is so much to see.  The different displays for the war in the Pacific and the war in Europe are so well designed.  Would highly recommend a visit to anyone - even if you're not a history buff."
87,An Unexpected Opportunity,"This was a return visit to this fantastic Memorial to The Greatest Generation. I was able to take more time and explore some of the displays that I was not able to see on my last visit.The Broken stained Glass display inspired by a Chaplin was a great perspective on the damage down to the Houses of Worship in the European Theater.  ""Home Front"" was a great reminder of the sacrifices made by all Americans in the War Effort. If you have gone once you deserve to see it again."
88,History is told in a dramatic way,"My husband and I visited the National WWII Museum the weekend of 10/02-10/04.  Beautiful, well laid-out, thoughtful, good artifacts, and educational!  I had no idea it was here.   Must see!"
89,Amazing adventure ,"More information than you can shake a stick at. A great museum with a lot of high quality exhibits. If you are a fan of WWII history, you absolutely must go here."
90,National WWII Musuem,"An absolutely amazing experience.  You keep going and going through all the exhibits, and the sheer magnitude of what humanity went though during that horrible period of time is simply overwhelming.   We spent most of a day there and I could have easily spent two days to stop and really look at everything.The ""Beyond All Boundaries"" experience narrated by Tom Hanks is a must-see.  Don't skip it because of the add-on price.   It's worth it.  There is construction going on and I'll be back to see the new things that are coming."
91,Very well done,I wish I could have spent more time here. It is outstanding place to learn about WW2 from the very beginning untilThe end. It covers the war prior to the United States actually entered the war after the attack at Pearl Harbor. I learned so much about the sacrifices made on all sides and the allieds triumph over evil. If you stopped and read everything you would literally be here for months. The 4 d movie is excellent and gave you a good overview of the war but the individual exhibits and the collection of war equipment is totally amazing. If you are a history buff it is not to be missed. I highly recommend this museum to learn about what happened and how our country came together to fight and win this war.
92,Great musem,There are a million reasons why this is the number one ranked attraction in New Orleans.  As a US History teacher I of course wanted to visit. I was not disappointed. You need a day minimum to really see everything. Absolutely go.
93,Excellent schooling on WW2!,The WWII museum was incredible. We spent a little over 2 hours and wish we could have spent at least 2 more hours and we also need to come back and watch the movie
94,worth the time,This is an excellent museum! There are 6 buildings that are very well laid out. The exhibits are fantastic with a lot of detail. You could spend days in here but you can move through at your own pace. There is a restaurant and a snack shop and a couple of gift shops. They have interactive displays and a lot of documentary clips. The displays and exhibits  are very creative. One has the movie clips showing on screens throughout a jungle like exhibit and one has them showing on screens in a snow covered forest. Very informative and a great overall perspective of the war. We loved it!
95,So informative! ,We LOVED this museum. The movie is worth the price of admission. We especially liked the Pacific section because we did not know so much about that part of the war. It was a wonderful place to visit.
96,WW2 MUseum,Went for a convention and presentation.  The entire experience was fantastic!  The food was great.  The staff were friendly.  The presentation went well and the stage/lighting/sound were excellent.  I would recommend for any event.
97,Wonderful museum,"This museum, which we didn't know existed, is excellent!  What an education.  Maybe it's just our age, but reading about the war, seeing actual video and pictures, and actual military attire, weapons and more, the museum captured our attention for 7 1/2 hours.  We didn't even stop for lunch.  We had to go back the next day to watch the 45 video narrated by Tom Hanks.  We definitely have a much better understanding of how the war started, which countries were in it, and how it was won by our brave men and women in uniform!"
98,Everyone should visit this amazing museum!,"What a museum. It is absolutely huge and you won't be able to see it in a day.  It's a lot of information packed into a very large space. We wandered for at least a couple of hours, then took in the Beyond All Boundaries show. If there is a particular interest in a period of WWII, search it out and spend time there.  This is a museum that needs repeat visits to see it all."
99,WWII Museum March 2020,"An overwhelmingly wonderful experience!  This museum is so very well done!  A must ""go see"" when in New Orleans."
100,Go with time,Went here during Covid. The place was almost empty and we got to spend a lot of time looking at stuff. I watch the WW2 programs on tv but this has much more and many war items to see. Thank you for presenting this in a way that brings it to life. My spouse didn’t even know that we were fighting on 2 fronts so it made it more special for her to learn new things.
101,An exceptional  musuem,This is an awesome facility. The content is ver humbling and makes me proud to be an American . It saddens me to look at everything these men and women sacrificed and today to see our own people attempt to destroy our country and values !!!
102,Interesting but Generalized,Amazing coverage of the war. Pictures and film that I never saw. We went on the submarine experience. Not very good. I would avoid that one. We could have gone back for another 5hours.
103,Awesome,"The 4d movie was awesome, the whole museum is amazing!  Sad that the soda shoppe was closed but there is always next time!"
104,So glad we went...,My dad was part of the WWII war effort but he never talked about it much.  Without museums of this caliber we later generations would never know what those veterans went through.  I don't think we can begin to imagine how difficult it was for the leaders to make decisions that would affect so many lives. I'm so thankful that they were there and did what they did so we could have such a great country to grow up in.
105,Incredible Museum Not to Be Missed,"I read allow a few hours but we were there for the entire day from open to close..  So much to see!  The movie was great (buy tickets in advance) Just wish they had better maps of the entire museum.  The special exhibit, Remembered Light - glass fragments from WWII was hauntingly beautiful."
106,A must see!,My husband is interested in anything about WWII. He was like a kid and we saw as much as we could in an afternoon. I especially loved the story of the military chaplain who collected glass from churches that were bombed during the war. The chaplain kept a diary on the fragments and they were reassembled by artists to tell different parts of his diary. Very moving and emotional. We had drinks and a snack in the American Sector Restaurant. Much better than your usual museums cafe.
107,WW2 Museum,"This museum is beyond words, really. First, it is huge with more artifacts than probably all other museums combined. We have visited Churchill's War Rooms and thought it was amazing, but this museum surpassed it. From personal stories intertwined to just so many facts and interesting displays, they hit everything when they made this place. My teenager appreciated how the floor got rough when we were learning about being in the trenches and was smooth carpet when we read about less intense portions. Just amazing. Go and spend your day here!"
108,Definitely worth a stop while in New Orleans,This is a must see in New Orleans. So much information. We spent about 4 hours but would have liked to have had time to go back the next day. Will go again for sure. Great restaurant on site.
109,Awesome museum ,"This is the second time I’ve been to this museum, and I would gladly go again. They do a brilliant job if organizing the information as well as drawing attention to less talked about aspects of the war, like the Pacific theater. I could stay here for hours."
110,"Not handicapped accessible, very disappointed","I was so looking forward to this museum,  but after touring one floor in only one building, we left. Too many people, too hard to navigate in a wheelchair, I couldn't see into exhibits and the 'hear testimonials' little rooms aren't made to fit into. There are glass panels that block full access to doorways, it makes no sense. I left sad and out $70 dollars.  I gave the poor review because I didn't get to see it."
111,Monumental monument to America’s WWII contribution,This is a venue NOT to be missed. The curators have designed a well thought out way to visit the components of WW 2. Allow a full day and be sure to include Tom Hanks unbelievable moving and emotional movie with your ticket. Every American of every age should be required by law to visit this museum as its message is ageless.
112,Comprehensive and Masterful,This is a must stop when visiting New Orleans.  I manage to visit every time I am in the city.  This museum is a fitting tribute to those who served in WWII.
113,Wonderful,Beautifully constructed museum and well thought out layout. Do keep in mind that this is not a museum you could do under an hour. There is massive amounts of information and it could take hours to get through the whole museum. There is a massive presence of older folks so be mindful of noise levels.
114,What a show!,"Best WW2 museum in the country, kids got a lot out of it too. Do the submarine “final mission” and go through as many exhibits as you can - it’s so comprehensive."
115,Great way to spend a day in NOLA,It's great a lot of history things but I only get 3 stars cause the whole museum should be open when you buy your pass but you got to buy more tickets for others parts which is BS and everything should be a one time buy. Already have to pay $29 and what us to pay another $10-$20 on top of that to see the other part what greedy wankers.
116,Great Museum!,"There is so much that they could have done with these exhibits.  Things could be interactive.  Following the dog tag or soldiers could be more poignant.  The 4D movie missed the mark.  It reminded me of newsreels at the movies when I was young.  I love they have volunteer veterans and hearing their stories as I spoke with them was much more interesting.  Once you see one building, you don't need to see others.  They already need to revamp exhibits!"
117,YOU HAVE TO GO HERE,"Excellent experience, learned a lot.  Allow plenty of time.  We were there over 3 hours and still only got through 2 exhibits."
118,Don’t Miss!!,I was so excited to be able to visit the WWII Museum while in New Orleans. My grandfather served in the US Army as a Radio Operator and fought Gen. Rommel in Northern Africa. Learning even more about WWII history was amazing. A person could easily spend two days visiting the museum.
119,WWII Museum worth the visit,"It's ok, but I was disappointed in truth - the scale of the museum buildings promised something more substantial. Having visited WW!! museums in eg Normandy , this pales by comparison. Exhibits are limited, storyboards  ae confused and of mixed quality. And really quite expensive."
120,Wonderful Musem,The museum has a number of exhibits that are all very well laid out. Real WW2 vets volunteer and make the experience
121,Learned more than I thought I knew,This was my second time to the museum and it was a wonderful experience once again. This is not a museum that you can only go through once if you really want to appreciate it.  I suggest two days to allow yourself the time and get to see the movies as well
122,Do Not Miss...It’s The Best,My husband loves the history lessons and workshops offered by this museum.  Mr. Hanks and all who made this museum come to fruition should be honored and proud of the meticulous work and memories preserved by this museum.
123,A Must See for Americans!,You could spend a week here stepping back in time to learn about WWII or just a few hours is also beneficial
124,A must see in New Orleans,"This is a must visit in Nola and share so much history and content, you really can plan your time here and see exhibits that are of most interest to you. On my first trip I only gave myself 2 hours which was definitely not enough, and on the next trip I spent a comfortable 5 hours here in one day (included a 20 min 3D movie). This is great for friends, families (fun activities for kids) and also couples. I learnt a ton!"
125,Bringing history alive!,If you are in New Orleans and appreciate a good museum then this is a must see. The attention to detail is phenomenal and very educational.
126,A must for all Americans ,"The museum definitely competes with Washington DC museums in quality.  Extremely informative and well done.  Something for everyone, but I think older kids will like better than younger.  The two $7 experiences are a must!"
127,Iconic!,One of the best museums in the US. Great for families and especially teens.Movies and scenes from the European Theater and Pacific. So educational and entertaining.
128,Excellent Museum,"Everyone should see this. Incredible history. Museum is very well done. This museum is perfect for every age group. Plan several hours, lots to see."
129,Wonderful,"We've been three times, and there's always more to see.  It's a must visit, even worth a special trip just to go there."
130,Loved it!,"It is hard to cram so much history from many countries into the WW2 museum. Despite its size, they tried to do the best they could. It starts off small with a few teasers but then expands to several different floors and multiple buildings. There was history of glass found through cities of fallen cathedrals, the daily life of civilians back in the U.S., internment camps and then of course everything to do with the war. But again, to cram as much history in 3-4 hours is difficult. It can truly be an all day affair. Although the tour touched on many different parts of the war, I felt campaigns through Italy and Africa were mostly untouched. Of course, many people want to see the war inside Europe from France into Germany or from Hawaii to Japan, but there were other parts of the war I wish the museum was big enough to display.Overall, it was an exceptional tour and worth the price of admission for the history. This is history that does not need to be forgot lest we could repeat it."
131,Fabulous Museum,"This is a top-notch museum definitely worth a stop during your visit.  It is right of the St. Charles streetcar line, so easy to get to.  The exhibits are of top quality, and tell the World War II story in an engaging way suitable for everyone from kids to hardcore History Channel types.  The air conditioned venue also makes for a nice break during the heat of a New Orleans day."
132,What Museums Should Be,"What a find! Even if you are not a history buff, the presentations are outstanding, as is the movie Beyond All Boundaries. The information can be a little overwhelming, so we finished with the US Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing Center. Everything is clean and shiny, ample hand sanitiser stations. Even the bathrooms are socially distanced."
133,Great Visit,"This is a top notch destination. The museum is full of everything you need to know and see about WW2.  There is something of interest everywhere.  The docents are most helpful and courteous. This should be a must see for every New Orleans visitor, young and old."
134,Something for Everyone,"We spent several hours touring the museum, viewing the movie  ""Beyond All Boundaries"", and  the 'USS Tang Submarine Experience'.  The museum is very well put together.    A must see if you are visiting New Orleans.  We had lunch in The American Sector Restaurant.  Food and Service were both good.  The museum is easy to get too via public transportation in the morning, but if you are leaving the museum mid afternoon and expect to catch the St. Charles Streetcar,  you should maybe make alternate plans.  Three streetcars came to to the stop while we where there but they were jam packed and not taking any more passengers.  We ended up walking back to our hotel.  Otherwise, it was a very interesting day."
135,Family friendly! A MUST for NOLA visitors!,Excellent museum with a lot to see.  I recommend you take a lot of time to see.  We were there for about 4 hours & still didn’t get to see everything.
136,Great Homeschool day for our son!,"Visited the museum on a Sunday afternoon. It was VERY crowded, but people were respectable. Much to see (lots of original old footage) and read. You could easily spend 2 days taking in everything. Limited food available within the building. Disappointed there were not more airplanes/tanks/original equipment on display."
137,Excellent lesson on WWII with actual items being exhibited,"Amazing.  My dad served on the Eastern front and I was so humbled by what I learned about the sacrifices these men and women endured.My dad told us stories of the war but no way near what I learned from my visit.  I highly recommend it to everyone. Thank you for honoring these people for all they gave from their country,"
138,Too much to see for one day!,"Wow, what a great and fun and educational museum. Their film with Tom Hanks was well worth the cost, very stunning and moving. The entire museum was very interactive and filled with great videos of the war in both theaters. We spent an entire day and was so well worth it for the overall quality. Highly recommend this museum."
139,Well worth the cost,A must if you visit New Orleans. It walks you through the Pacific theater and then the European theater and shows the harsh reality of the brave young men who fought for our country. The Tang Submarine experience was great.
140,My favorite Museum,"Tons and tons of facts to read and videos to watch for an extensive understanding of the WW2, amazing. Takes about a whole day and more to visit!"
141,Incredible museum with amazing collection!,"The museum is huge and filled with information. The different areas are set up in a very engaging way. Only disappointment was that there are actually only a few exhibits of cars, planes etc . You have a few planes and some jeeps, but no tanks.Still definitely recommend"
142,Son of WW II Artillery Forward Observer,Whether you are a history buff or not you should take some time to visit this place.  Lot's of different areas in the museum so plan to be here for a while.  We had two kids with us so we were here for about 4 hours.  They were not going to make it more than that.  But if you are the type of person who looks at and reads everything you might want to plan the whole day.
143,WW II Forward Observer's son,Great museum !  You could spend days to see it all.  Near the CBD.   A must visit in New Orleans.  Plan a half day
144,A must see,"I am a WW2 buff.  My father repaired airplanes north of London during the war.   I've read numerous books about the war and watched many a movie.  I was excited to go through the museum.  This museum is incredible!  The layout, the WW2 content, videos, photos, items from the war are very very impressive.   All fronts of the war are addressed.   There are 5 sections (3 buildings).  I added a lot of new information to my already vast knowledge.  I was told that they are adding a new building which will address the liberation/post war time. Make your reservations on line. You will pick a specific day and time to arrive.  Be sure to pay the extra $7 for the 4D movie.  Spectacular!!!As we toured during covid, we wore masks. The main restaurant was open.  Nice bathrooms throughout the buildings.  Elevators are available for those who cannot navigate stairs.  Wonderful large gift shop, that also sells a few cold beverages and candy/snacks.Allow plenty of time.  We spent 4 hours in the museum and easily could have spent more. Wonderful, knowledgeable volunteers are throughout the exhibits to answer questions. Leaving this museum gave me a new appreciation for the huge sacrifice of multiple thousands to maintain our freedom.  Thank you service people!  NOTE:.  It's chilly in these buildings so bring a sweater or jacket."
145,Great Museum.,One of the best museums concerning WWII. Gives a bit of a different perspective concerning the landing on D-Day.
146,Awesome Museum ,"Spent the afternoon here last weekend. Provided a lot of information on how WWII started, how America contributed to the war, the European front, and the Pacific front. Took about 3 hours to go through the entire museum. There is a 40 minute movie offered however we did not watch it. The museum has an interactive component as well. Upon entering, you are given a tag that you may scan at various locations around the museum, following the story of a soldier from WWII. Only complaint was that the building was very cold!"
147,Incredibly well done history of WWII,2 time back. It just keeps getting better    Well done in every way. Easy to get to and if you are driving there is a parking lot right next door.  The 4d movie narrated by Tom Hanks was excellent. Don’t miss this Chance to go back in our country’s history.
148,Walking in my father's foot steps.,Awesome museum. Great layout and tons of displays and exhibits. Unbelievable information. Highly recommend this museum for anyone visiting New Orleans.
149,Great salute to our greatest generation,"This is one of the most highly rated attractions in New Orleans and was recommended by our shuttle driver on the way into town.  The museum is huge, so plan to spend some time there to take it all in.  The exhibits are excellent and show how the war progressed in the east and west theaters of operations.  The 4D ""Beyond all Boundaries"" exhibit was excellent so make sure to get your passes when you enter.  If you are at all interested in the history of this global conflict, you need to visit."
150,Amazing Museum,"This ww11 musium is one of the newer attractions in new Orleans,  there is so much to see that it takes 2 to 3 days to see the entire musium, but we'll worth it."
151,Wonderful Museum,"We spent seven hours here and still did not see it all!!!   We started with the “Beyond Boundaries” movie (well worth it) which set the tone for our experience.  The exhibits focus on personal stories, along with the facts.  It was moving, mesmerizing and mind boggling at the same time, seeing the extent and devastation of the war thru pictures, videos and exhibits.  You could easily spend at least two days here!!!  The pulled pork sandwich in the restaurant was good too!!!  A MUST SEE!!!"
152,Must Visit,What an amazing place! Phenomenal movie to launch the visit. A trip through the European and the Pacific theaters. We wrapped up with a quick bite at the American sector restaurant- a fabulous day - awe inspiring and sobering.
153,Informative and entertaining for family with four teens,"A huge place but I was never fatigued- it was all so engaging.  An incredible range of artifacts, displays, and film.  Unlike many other museums, this one really gives comprehensive due to ALL those who served: Japanese-Americans, women, African-Americans, the civilian ""homefront.""  Really tells the story of the rise of totalitarianism and fascism in a way that makes the viewer aware of the importance of the sacrifice that was made by those who fought, and that we still need to be ever vigilant."
154,Great experience ,Wonderful museum!  Take your time.  We were.there for 5 hours.  See the movie. It's worth the few extra dollars.  Lunch was great.  Order the party melt and fries!  We even ordered a brick for the walkway💗
155,Owner,"Without a doubt, the most in depth history of WWII all in one area.  The 45 minute movie is phenominal.  So many artifacts to look at and read about.  I spent five hours in there, and didn't see everything.  Will definitely be going back again the next time I'm in the big easy."
156,Excellent Museum Experience,This museum is a true treasure. The movie narrated by Tom Hanks is incredible. Don’t miss the rest of the museum that really brings this terrible war to life. So educational. I’d buy tickets ahead of time. I’ve been there twice and will go back.
157,Must see ,This museum is a true treasure. The movie narrated by Tom Hanks is incredible. Don’t miss the rest of the museum that really brings this terrible war to life. So educational. I’d buy tickets ahead of time. I’ve been there twice and will go back.
158,Stunning!,You can't do it all on a weekend visit to NOLA but you will have missed a great experience not visiting The National WWII Museum.  This museum was as well planned and engaging as any history museum we have visited. You can easily spend a day (or more) looking at everything. Bring your walking shoes because this place is huge. This type of museum or history doesn't have to be a key interest for you to enjoy and benefit from The National WWII Museum.
159,Awesome!!!  You need time to see this properly ,"This is a great place to visit and gives you personal stories of those that fought via an interactive ""dog tag.""  It highlights the major battles and the living conditions of theaters.Overall, this is a museum that gives you the highlights.  Nothing is wrong with that.  If you want more information on certain parts of the war, like the different units that fought, be disappointed.  The war is a huge topic and there is not enough room for all the topics.  Overall, GO!"
160,A must see,"Amazing collection on WWII with interactive content. While it is what NOLA is known for, this museum is completely worth it. I recommend spending at least 2 to 3 hours to see most of it, though you could spend much more."
161,Great experience,"We went on a trip to New Orleans recently ... a bit impromptu because we're a homeschooling family and our school is wherever we are. :) We spent the entire day at the museum just learning as much as we could. What better way to teach about WWII than stepping into a real train car that took the original soldiers to their posts? We followed our assigned soldier and sadly, the one my son pulled did not survive the war. It seemed to drive it home for him. There honestly wasn't enough time in one day to learn everything. We could have easily spent two days exploring the museum and learning."
162,A must see!!!,Wonderful museum! Very informative and great layout. Staff (many veterans) very helpful. One tip: only use the museum parking garage. The pay lots right by the entrance WILL BOOT YOUR CAR! It is very hard to calculate how long you will spend in the museum so DON'T use the pay lots.
163,Interesting and moving museum.,"The staff was nice. I feel for the price,  a tour guide would be awesome.. Having some walk though and explain what your looking at."
164,WWII Museum,"Fantastic museum, very well planned and beautifully done. Lots of detail so you'll need the 2 day ticket if you're really into reading and seeing everything. Be sure to book the 4D movie as well!"
165,Don’t miss this treasure when you go to NOLA.,"Visiting this museum was the highlight of my time in NOLA.  I spent an entire day checking out all the buildings and displays.  I encourage everyone to also experience the 4D ""Beyond All Boundaries"" which has dazzling effects and takes the audience through WWII from the home front to the trenches and is narrated by actor Tom Hanks AND also see ""Final Mission: USS Tang Submarine Experience"" in their last epic battle against Japanese forces."
166,"More than a museum, it is an experience!!!","This is a unique and amazing site in New Orleans. You could spend an entire day at this multi building venue.Definitely, take on the 4D movie."
167,Amazing museum.  I ran out of time.,"Terribly disappointing. First, I’ve literally never paid (just under) $30 US for a museum anywhere in the world. More expensive than the Louvre and the Uffizi? Be serious.Worse, I learned literally nothing. Several ordinary documentaries on the telly and you know what you will see here. Add in very poor guidance/navigation and it adds up to a very poor experience. I am baffled as to why people would provide such great reviews of this place. If I had an eight-year-old grandchild who knew nothing of World War II, then this could provide a good introduction. For anyone else, and I’m not exaggerating, this is a complete waste of time."
168,Fantastic and Gut Wrenching,"A little expensive but definitely worth it. Moving through different rooms you are told the story of world war 2 from an American perspective. There are lots of photos, videos, artefacts and audio displays telling the story from a range of perspectives and people. I spent at least 4 hours moving through the museum and looking at everything. Very enjoyable"
169,Great and intuitive museum,"This is a big museum. You need 2-5 hours. If you want to check everything, You can spend the whole day from 10 am to 5 pm. The admission is a bit high for $29.But it is still worth paying it."
170,Must See Museum,"It is a very good museum located in a dynamic district, we liked everything there with the history of this beautiful country, we recommend the visit of this museum"
171,My Father's war,"When I think of museums, I think of artifacts. This place has very few. It relies on interviews, news reels, plaques of personal information about soldiers and flashy technology. I should have known it wouldn't be my day when the 'guy' assigned to me died in the first ten minutes. Not really my style."
172,Worth a second visit.,This museum could be a master class on WW2. You can visit and spent 3 hours or 8 or more hours.My wife and I spent about 4 hours here a couple weeks ago. Spoke with some other people that that were coming back for their second DAY at the museum. Nice display of WW2 aircraft and information about Higgins Industries (the reason this museum is in NO) and the PT Boat. I would highly recommend this museum for anyone with even a remote interest in WW2.
173,Very Moving Experience,"Even though we are Canadian, we enjoyed learning a bit more about the war.  The movie (narrated by several famous people including Tom Hanks) was VERY well done.  We only had two hours to tour the museum so the $35 price was a little expensive for us.  It is a place you can easily spend several hours (or even a full day) in.  Much to see and learn about."
174,The most comprehensive (and attractive) coverage of the war in a single place,"If you want to see and experience WW2 history, this is the place! Large museum with excellent, interactive displays that range the whole history of the war."
175,So much history!!!  Give yourself two days...at least.,My kids made the suggestion that we go and although pricey it was well worth the time and cost of admission.  Really enjoyed the Dday exhibit and the Merchant Marine displays.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to to see the real impacts of communism and socialism on societies and what lead us to war.  Go check it out.
176,Five hours - not enough time,"Loved all of the interactive displays.  Typically not like museums, but this one was great.  Had lots of recordings from real people, so that you could better experience what they went through."
177,Educational and interesting Museum,"There is nothing else to compare to this museum.  We spent six hours there and could have spent two days.  The 3D movie, ""Beyond All Boundaries"" narrated by Tom Hanks was Incredible and not to be missed.  The staff and volunteers were helpful and friendly.  There is just too much to describe and simply must be visited and seen to appreciate the sacrifices of The Greatest Generation."
178,A Moving Experience,The museum does a first-rate job of presenting a history of this war without the overlay of a sanitized picture we so often read and see. It is a must-see if in New Orleans and also a reason to go.
179,Amazing History,A great museum covering the events of WW2 .The displays are detailed and very informative. The Boeing Theater displays were fantastic
180,All Americans should visit the WWII museum,Incredibly well done history of WWII comes alive through on-site 4-D movie and exhibits. Staff are eager to help.
181,Great historical museum,We visited with college students for spring break. So thankful the stories of individual veterans are preserved in photo and video! The flow of the displays make it intriguing and instructional. Plan to spend the whole day! We visited 12-5 pm and didn't see it all. Excellent way to honor our veterans and a must see when visiting NOLA.
182,Don’t miss this treasure when you go to NOLA.,This is an outstanding museum. It really makes one appreciate what that generation did for our country. Sacrifices  were made by the soldiers as well as their families. Touring this museum helps one realize how fortunate our generation has been to live in a free country.
183,Very impressive,"There were so many things to see and read on this tour.  The most interesting, to me, were the audio clips from various people throughout the museum.  They discussed first hand their experiences of a specific event."
184,Amazing Place,The museum is beautiful and well designed with the Pacific campaign on the 2nd floor and the European campaign on the 1st.  Plenty of interactive displays and loads of information.  Just stopping to read all the individual plaques that adorn the displays will take an hour.  A must see in New Orleans for anyone interested in WWII.
185,"Excellent museum, but too much to see in one visit.",Fantastic museum. You could easily spend days there and not get bored. Saw the 4D movie. Well worth the $7 price tag. All-around fantastic museum.
186,Allow at least a half day...,"You could spend hours here and still not tap into all of the exhibits. There is so much to learn here about WW 2. Trying to explain this place doesn't do it justice. You have got to come and see it for yourselves. We owe so much to our brave men and women for the service. We only have a few hours so we were not able to see as much as we would have liked. The videos, the photos, the equipment, etc. lets you know putting this all together took years of hard work."
187,DON'T MISS THIS,"Take a full day to see the museum or get a 2 day pass - you will need it. The exhibits are so immersive that you feel connected to the time, the era, the people, the fear, the optimism...all in a way that I have never experienced in a museum."
188,Great place to learn more about WW2,"We just LOVED this museum. So much so that we took advantage of their second day ticket for and additional $7/person. Our whole family enjoyed it (ages 11-43) and there is something for everyone. It can be quite graphic, but so is war so be prepared. It's also quite beautiful (we spent an hour alone in the church stained glass exhibit)."
189,A great experience for the entire family.,"We spent several hours at the museum, but you could spend the entire day there. Every exhibit was done w/ respect & captured the emotions of the time."
190,One of the top Museums in USA,"We purchased our tickets online and added the movie Beyond Borders which was fantastic. We walked through the Berlin and the Pacific/Tokyo exhibit first which I think made the movie even better. Hint - If you take the Sightseeing bus, they offer a small discount coupon. If you can, talk to some of the volunteers and if you can meet someone who actually served there, the experience will be even better. Take advantage of the interactive components and the oral histories, it’s worth it. We also added the second day - we had some particularly nasty weather during our vacation so this was a perfect time. We loved it."
191,Must see,"The initial sticker shock gave me some pause but I decided to bite the bullet and  visit this museum. I was not disappointed. Excellent layout, exhibits and information. I don't think I have ever been inside an actual submarine indoors before.  Do not pass up the opportunity to visit this museum."
192,A Full Day at the Museum,"I had purchased a brick in remembrance of my father.  The ticket office told me exactly how to find it.  It is in Shadow of a large WW II sign on building.  I was pleased.  The museum is fantastic.  We visited the Trail to Berlin. Well, laid out and interesting.  Museum pieces are shown with several stops for video clips.  Airplane presentations are super.  It would take two or three days to see it all."
193,A museum for a WW2 buff.,Plan to spend the day at this awesome museum. I was there 4 hours and didn’t come close to seeing everything. You can buy a second day pass for $7. There are a lot of videos that range from 2-7 minutes. These are good to give your feet a rest. There are food options here that are good.
194,Amazing!,What an unbelievably educational experience.  Very well done telling the history of all aspects of WWII.   There is so much to see and to experience that I would recommend at least 2 days.
195,The history of WWII at one location,The museum is organized in such a way you can spend as little or as much time there as fits your interest and schedule
196,Need more than one day.,We were told we would need 3 hours to see this museum.  We allowed almost that much but wished we had all day for it.  Every exhibit was excellent.  Our teen-age grandchildren gained a true understanding of WWII and what led up to it.  The exhibit also showed how much we have gained in technology since that time.
197,Fantastic visit. Not disappointed!,Great Experience. The facility was well organized and the movie theater experience was wonderful..............................
198,A Memorable and moving experience!,"We visited on a Saturday morning and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  I highly recommend it and would return again.  Clean, interesting, well laid out. An excellent museum all around."
199,The Greatest Generation,Really impressive displays and videos. Nice addition: Dog Tag Story...follow a particular veteran assigned to you and learn about their war journey.
200,WWII Museum,We spent a few days in New Orleans for my husbands 40th birthday. We visited the museum on a Thursday. We spent about 5 hours and easily could’ve spent more time to see and read every single thing. This museum is very nice and very informative. Definitely recommend.
201,Moving and Confronting Memorial,"This was a must do in NOLA. My family, with teens spent 5 hours there. You must watch the movie, narrated by Tom Hanks, it was a favorite of the family. Because of the artifacts, even as a past history teacher, I learned so much. We loved WW2 Museum. We go to museums everywhere we travel, and this one stands as one of the best."
202,Don't miss this!,"An absolute must see in NOLA.  I was there for five hours and didn't even get through everything.  Please note, that I am a huge history lover and took my time going through.  I would highly suggest this for anyone when you are in NOLA!"
203,Quick but worth it,During the covid crisis the crowds are way down. You can do the whole campus in a single day without a problem. The museum will overwhelm your senses. The exhibits are wonderful assembled and the story of the war is perfect illustrated for all.
204,A must see when you visit New Orleans.,I loved how you can travel through this museum and learn so much through the eyes of real people who lived through this.
205,Amazing,If you like history this is a must it’s amazing and very neat. Staff rude and it’s a hard because of the traffic but the history is and the exhibits are amazing.
206,Take your time to visit this museum,"Start early and plan to stay the whole day, including the theater presentation.  There is much to see and many video interviews and commentaries, all of which are excellent.  The displays are not just collected knick knacks, they are a coherent time line that allows the visitor to follow the events as they unfolded."
207,AMAZING!,Huge museum filled with exhibits and information.  It was a somber and most informative visit.  Plan on at least 4 hours.  Tom Hanks film is well worth the extra cost.
208,Great place to visit,This is such an interactive Museum from the momdnt you enter and board the train. Every component from cause to affect and fantatsic displays and real footage. Well done New Orleans and will definitely go again if I get the chance
209,Only spent 5hours there.,"Finding things to do in NOLA during the pandemic is a challenge, but our family of five (kids ages 12, 15 and 18), managed a visited to the National WWII Museum. The movie is fabulous and is not to be missed. All of the exhibits were interesting. We got there at 2 o'clock, had a quick (rather expensive) lunch and our movie time was 3 pm. We went to the temporary Ghost Army exhibit, which introduced us to the art of military disguise. The permanent exhibits were also excellent and interesting even for our non-history buff 15 year-old. I would allot 3+ hours for this museum to have enough time to see the movie and not feel rushed. If you do not read every description, you can do it in less."
210,Fantastic Museum,"Didnt intend to visit, but due to weather we decided to give it a go. It is excellent and well worth it. Defibnitely do the Tom Hanks Movie, but i would skip the submarine tour, in my opinion not worth the extra money. Also we could have used that tome better seeing other things.Loads of things to do and also its really well presented ."
211,American WW2 museum  ,"Was there for a private party, so only got to see one wing but as I was walking through the invasion of Europe wing, I felt like my dad (served in Patton's arm and passed away last April) was with me. Wish I could have seen more."
212,Beautifully done,"Spent three quarters of a day here.. could have spent much more time. Well organized and informative .. I didn’t think going to see the actual planes used in the war would be interesting but I was wrong.. I got to see how small and close quarters some were. Made the visit personal by highlighting individuals that I could follow during their war experience. Included all.. soldiers of color, native Americans and women..By lunch time we didn’t want to leave and ate at the American restaurant.. delicious!! Parking and ticket purchasing was easy and don’t miss the movie Tom Hanks narrates.. sets the wars start up excellently.."
213,A Sober Day in History,"We didn't have visiting a WWII museum on our radar when planning a visit to New Orleans, but after seeing the high ratings, we decided to go. Plan for several hours to just get an overview. A wonderful museum."
214,New orleans,"If you have any sort of interest in history, this is a must see.  We spent somewhere between 5 and 6 hours there and did not see it all.,  They have a option for a second day at a much reduced rate.This is not a cheap visit.  Tickets for 2 seniors totaled $50.  To see the Tom Hanks movie is another $7 a piece.  Parking costs us $14 dollars.  So that is $78 before any food or souvenirs.On the other hand, even as a history buff, I learned many things. It is a multi-media presentation that keeps you involved.  I have always appreciated the men and women who fought in this war.  This doubled down on that appreciation. Do yourself a favor and spend the money."
215,Great Museum ,"We arrive at 12, it’s huge, we didn’t have time for finish all the museum, it’s very detailed, everything was very interesting, the buildings with a beautiful architecture, we loved the interactive movie, a lot of stuff I didn’t know about the war, my husband a I enjoyed a lot, we hope come back again and finish to see all the museum, very clean. With the requirements of distancing,"
216,Don't Miss this World Class Museum,"If you enjoy museums and are a fan of history, this is not to be missed. We spent 5 hours in here and could have spent even more time exploring everything. Well organized and incredibly thorough presentation of the history of WWII. Don't miss the riveting 4D movie Beyond All Boundaries. This costs $7 extra but is well worth it and contributed to the overall experience."
217,Incredible,Has to be a must for anyone interested in history around WWII. Interactive and a must for a visit to New Orleans.
218,Moving and informative,"Very interesting museum.  Can spend a good day here. It was nice that once we had finished the tour that there were two world II veterans who we chatted to.  Found these two gentleman very interesting as one had married a lady from the UK,"
219,Worthwhile visit,"The movie alone -- ""Beyond All Boundaries"" -- makes this museum worth a visit. As WWII gets further and further behind us, it is ever more important to keep it relevant, and this extraordinary museum does that with highly interactive exhibits, artifacts, videos, uniforms, weapons -- you name it. It is so interesting and educational. A must-see for anyone visiting NOLA -- give it at least a half-day."
220,Visit at the WWll museum after a cruise,Plan to spend at least 5 enjoyable hours when you visit. The displays are well done and the films and narrative are very informative. The quality of the exhibits are exceptional and we left knowing a whole lot more than we did before the visit. We included this stop when we visited New Orleans.
221,Must visit for a few hours,We arrived at opening and left at about 2 pm.  We did everything except one movie.  Great museum.  The food in the soda shop was good too.  REcommend taking the elevator for the Boeing area.
222,"National WWII Museum, New Orleans","A series of 5 or 6 buildings full of artifacts, film, and recreations. We enjoyed learning more about World War II and the greatest generation that basically fought two wars, supported our allies and truly engaged all together to show the world that the United States was the superpower. The only thing I truly missed was seeing any of the battle tanks from that era. A room was dedicated to the air planes of the US Army Air Force, Marines and Navy. A similar room with the tanks and unique vehicles would have been exciting as well. Worth your time to view as many exhibits as possible."
223,An American experience,"This is truly well done, don’t forget to experience the movie as well. It’s an immersive experience with a 3-d presentation that will educate and entertain."
224,Loved Museum,"You read about the great world wars, but you don't get to experience WW11 like this. Don't miss it and take advantage of the next day deal...you cannot appreciate it in one day."
225,Great place,"My family and I (boys ages: 17, 15 and 12) spent the entire day at the National WWII Museum on Wednesday, March 11th and had an incredible day. We paid extra for Beyond all Boundary’s movie with Tom Hanks and the interactive submarine experience, Final Mission. Definitely “a must” on the movie and “why not” on the sub experience. My boys loved both. We had a light breakfast before we started our 4 hour visit (still not enough time) at the museum cafe (delicious!) and lunch at the restaurant (service/food was okay...not great). The crowd was minimal (thank goodness) and exhibits incredible. So much to see, read and watch. A moving experience. I learned so much about WWII in a short amount of time from uniforms to gear to weaponry. My boys could not get enough information about all the guns, ammo, grenades, mines and tanks. They were completely entertained the entire 4 hours (very difficult feat for youth in this generation). Thank you to the countless volunteers who work tirelessly to share this important part of our history, including the WWII vet who was eager to share his “love” story of WWII."
226,An amazing experience,Started with the 4D movie narrated by Tom Hanks.  Then went to check out the war planes in the 4 level walk ways up close.  Then through the museum telling of the story of World War II like I had never experienced or thought about it that way before.  All in all history being told to make us all think again.
227,Fabulous,"On March 13, 2020, we spent most of the day visiting and enjoying the National World War II Museum.  It is an exceptional museum, one we could have easily spent several days touring.  Although the interactive displays were shut down throughout the museum (due to pandemic fears), we were nevertheless able to experience and enjoy the many other displays and treasures that lie within the multiple buildings which comprise the museum.  HIGHLY recommended."
228,Nola 2020,"Even if you already know a lot about WWll, this museum will still captivate you with its excellent overview of all the theaters of the war and especially through the personal and poignant stories told about individual servicemen. Learned so much and left with an even better understanding of the sacrifices made by both the troops and the people on the home front - not to mention those civilians sadly caught in the war zones. This museum should be required viewing for every resident of the U.S., to understand why we must safeguard against another event of this nature that our world may not survive. Plan to spend an entire day here, if not more."
229,Must go to!,"Wasn't on our list when we went to New Orleans, but had time so we went.  I'm glad we did! The way it was laid out, gave me much more perspective on this war.  Impressive place!"
230,Worth the admission fee,This was an interesting museum with a very vivid film. The history and battles were fairly generalized. It would be nice if you could track participants and specific generals. We especially loved the planes on exhibit. Nice cafe.
231,Humbling,"We are history fans, but anyone who has ever heard of World War II or American soldiers or love of country needs to see this amazing display of historical artifacts and information.  MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE GUIDED TOURS!! The docent was an amazing source of information and background stories regarding the exhibits and people involved in the war effort.You will love it, so be sure to buy the membership so that you can go back often as soon as the Corona Virus restrictions are lifted."
232,Excellent museum - highly recommend,We were only able to spend 2 hours on a quick trip to New Orleans. The online ticketing is very efficient. Picked our tickets up at will call and walked right in to the movie. Wandered aimlessly a bit into Boeing exhibit. A very informative volunteer talked with my husband about Corsair planes which his mother worked on.  Then he gave us tips on where to go to maximize things of interest.
233,Highly recommend,"This is not a museum to gloss over or race through.  Take your time and marvel.  It has interactive features to keep every age group engaged, and the layout for the tour puts the war in chronological order so you can see how the Allies dealt with Europe and the Pacific."
234,Interesting,"Not visiting this museum when in New Orleans is equivalent to missing Beignets   ..............  take the time to see  both Final Mission and Beyond all Boundaries.  Heads up, this may not be a PG viewing, so be considerate if you have little ones."
235,Wonderful museum,"Great museum with great exhibits and interesting artifacts, the movie however, was overrated and kinda cheesy."
236,Visually stunning movie...4D,"Definitely take your time going through this, there's a lot to see. Very well done and worth a visit, especially for the movie which is an add-on."
237,Must See History! ,Museum was nice and clean. Layout over the different buildings is a bit confusing. Very American view of the war. Simply overlooking all other allied countries. Aircraft building was amazing. But real lack of other vehicles was disappointing. Lots of videos to watch. Walked through in just over an hour
238,A must see,"As a military family, we couldn’t go to NOLA without checking out the WWII museum. My great uncle was a flight mechanic during the WWII and we got to hear so many stories from first hand experience - his basement was basically a whole WWII museum. The first thing and MUST see is the film - narrated by Tom Hanks - was exquisitely produced. As we walked through the museum, we read letters, saw pictures, studied uniforms and utensils, marveled at the different weapons, and felt such a deep respect for each story and soul. You can’t walk through this museum and not shes tears... We came with four kids under 8 and were not shy to talk about the things they were witnessing. We need to do this more - so they understand how they have their freedom, what it means to sacrifice, and so we never allow the horrors of that era to happen again. What an honor to experience this. Thank you for the ones who created this museum, the families that shared their mementos of loved ones, and for each person that works there. This is worth every single penny and more. I dare you to walk through this and not come out of those doors full of respect, honor, and gratitude. There’s no way you can’t. Incredible experience!"
239,Exceeded every expectation we could have had,Amazing interactive historical museum. You can spend the whole day here and must see the movie. There’s a few buildings so way to spend 2 days here.
240,Great visit,Very good and intuitive museum with lot of stuff to see and to learn. Everything in this museum is made with much effort in entertainment and information given. You should take around four-six hours to completely go through the museum. The optional Movie is entertaining and makes fun to watch. One of the best museum I ever visited. Can highly recommend.
241,Extensive,Overwhelming. You need a full day to really experience it all. Worth the visit.  Educational. A must visit if in New Orleans.
242,Not enough time,What an excellent museum and movie narrated by Tom Hanks with actual footage of war. Planes hung from the ceiling and much information was available to read or observe in the different buildings. Definitely worth a visit.
243,They missed the boat!,"What can I say that has not been said? It's so complete and excellently done, I'll try to find something not so complimentary to say.(1) Although there are a few interactive stations that young children will like, it's not a very interesting place for kids younger than teens.(2) It's overwhelming with information and could take multiple days to really take it all in.It deserves its ranking as #1 attraction of New Orleans"
244,Must See,"Most of the information in the museum can easily be found online, the crowds make it difficult to view the content, not worth 30 dollars"
245,The National WWII Museum,A must see for all ages above 13. So much history. A great educational tool for the younger generation to understand the sacrifices.
246,Always a great place to visit,"Went with 2 friends to this museum. We had no idea what to expect but we were so pleasantly surprised! The museum is huge and has multiple buildings to go through. If you just walk through the museum but don't spend time actually reading the captions of everything or watching the clips found throughout, it would maybe take you half a day. My group spent all day at the museum and we took our time enjoying each room and reading as much as we could and we barely made it out of the first building -- so we will definitely be returning on our next trip to New Orleans.One of the neatest things about the exhibit is the Dog Tag that you receive at the beginning of your tour -- it follows around a real person from WWII and tells their story throughout different stages of the war. This was such an awesome addition and made the museum that much more interactive. (And everyone's Dog Tag is different!)All of the employees were very nice and knowledgeable and were eager to help out with any questions we had. The gift shop was also nice and was not over priced. This is a MUST SEE in New Orleans if you are a history buff. Get there when they open at 9AM because you will spend the whole day there if you really take your time to enjoy every exhibit."
247,Interesting,Phenomenal experience. The entire museum is based on primary source recordings and documents. Interactive exhibits for hands on learning.   You need at least a day to absorb  everything here.
248,Awesome,The displays of information were fantastic. Felt like we were right in the middle of everything. The movie Beyond All Boundaries was excellent. The special effects again made us feel like we were a part of it.
249,A must to see ,"Take your time to go through this museum and learn about the sacrifices made by the world to protect itself from the Axis Powers, Germany, Italy, and Japan.  We spent only 3 hours but want to return on our next trip to New Orleans.  The movie was very informative and the Submarine Tang experience was well done. The 65 million lost to the ambitions of Hitler, Mussolini, and Emperor Hirohito must cause any rational person to pause and ensure that no country be allowed to create conditions of a global conflict again.  The next time with nuclear weapons will wipe out mankind."
250,So much to learn at this museum.,"Very well done...movie is a must.  You could spend a day here to absorb it all.  Helpful staff.  The Boeing air wing exhibit, while small, offers a close-up view of B 24."
251,AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE MUSEUM!,"Wonderful museum with a lot of interactive displays and interesting facts about WWII. The major exhibits tocus on home war effort, the Normandy invasion and the ""road"" to Berlin and Tokyo. Many WWII aircrafts on display. This should not be missed during a visit to New Orleans and easily reached by the St. Charles St streetcar (streetcar stop is one block from the museum entrance ). Really need to speed the entire day to give it justice. 2 restaurants on site to grab breakfast or lunch."
252,Awesome,Many different rooms to visit based on which part of the WW you wanted to learn about.  Picked up dogtags to get a personalized story of one soldier!
253,Me and Mrs B,Slightly disappointing that the majority of the museum was aimed towards Day-D and not much else. Would have liked more information on the Holocaust..
254,Moving Experience,Went to WWII museum during Spring Break.  Booked online ( will call line for tickets) and saved a lot of time.  Spent about 1.5 hours there before the “ beyond all boundaries” 4d film narrated by Tom Hanks.  Kids all enjoyed and learned things even before the movie.  Highly interactive with first person accounts.  Many docents through museum to ask questions or share more. Also had lunch at the restaurant.  Delicious!
255,Outstanding!,A must place to visit while in New Orleans. It takes about 4 hours to do entire museum. Don’t forget to get ticket that covers the movie. It’s a must see. Very interactive.
256,A must see when in New Orleans,"We spent a full day here, and we could have easily spent two days.  So much to see and so much to learn."
257,Interesting and Inforamtive,They have captured the heart and soul of this war. Relics and personal artifical from men and women who served during the war.As the grandson of a WW2 veteran and a combat veteran myself this means something more to me as I've heard the stories and created my own in war. Highly recommended every American should see it.
258,Visit to WWII Museum,"Plan on spending several hours or even a whole day, but it's well worth it.  I learned so much and gained a greater appreciation of the history."
259,A wonderful museum,"If you don’t know much WWII history, you’ll need about 5 hours to get through this entire complex. Warning: the museum is completely from the American perspective. Not necessarily a bad thing, but dangerously falls into this growing 21st century threat of forgetting the Holocaust (1945 exhibit mentions Bergen Belsen and Dachau but provides no context for this human catastrophe). Some of the exhibits lack maintenance and the overhead projectors make people stop and cluster in the middle of the rooms. Don’t get me wrong, the planners did an outstanding job, with plenty of artifacts, photographs, and physical recreations."
260,Fabulous museum made personal with individuals' stories,Make sure you give yourself 4-5 hours or 2 days or you will feel rushed and miss exhibits. And see the movie!
261,Not To Be Missed,"The whole place is interesting and well worth a visit should you be in the area, access is good for all age groups, exhibits are interesting and informative with many being interactive. The theatre presentation was very good."
262,My husband loves this place,"It was our first visit to NOLA and this was on my husband's ""wish list"" of activities. We made advance reservations for the Campaigns of Courage guided tour; there's no waiting in line when you purchase in advance. You are issued headsets so that you can hear the tour guide. It was well worth the extra money and I highly recommend it. Your tour guide will point out items that you may have missed because there is just so much to see. After the tour we headed over to the American Sector Restaurant and Bar for a snack and something to drink before heading back to revisit the exhibits. We enjoyed sharing the pulled pork nachos. Headed back after we had refreshed ourselves and still couldn't see everything. A couple of days later it rained so we headed back to the museum. Second day pass is only $7.00 - well worth it. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the interactive exhibits and the museum in general. This should definitely be #1 on your list when you come to visit."
263,Fantastic - must do special exhibits/experiences!,"Awesome museum,need at least 1/2 day to see. I recommend booking tickets online,skip the long quay & just pick up at will call window,also you can pick time of 4d movie narrated by Tom Hanks online. if you wait til you arrive it might be sold out. Use the map to make sure you don't miss any areas their are lots of exhibits to see. Submarine experience was ok, more for young adults,but we seniors still enjoyed it. nice cafe to get food & drink also"
264,This was our reason for our trip,"Really well-done museum. Information was presented in multiple formats, all visually very attractive  Very interesting, & very important."
265,Excellent museum,"World War ll MuseumThis place is a treasure of history to include pictures, replicas,recordings and personal memoirs from many people who were there during the conflict.From the very start in Europe and the chaos caused by Hitler, to the bombing of Japan that finally put an end to this tragic war.  They not only talk about the war, but the events that led up to it.It is split up into sections, so you leave each section and walk into the next part of history.   Interactive and historical you feel as if your there in many of the areas.   There was even a section telling about how those at home played their part.   Loved the personal interviews that you could listen to.  And there are plenty of guides along the way to answer questions.If we brought students here while teaching about this part of history they would leave with not only the facts but would also have a memorable experience of how this part of history affected the entire world.   Be sure to give yourself the better part of a day to visit.Admission is $28.50 and was well worth the price.  Several places to park for a fee in walking distance.  I understand they are always adding new displays so you will probably never have the same experience twice."
266,WW II Museum,"If you want to know about WWII, spend a couple of days in this museum. Really would advise a two day visit.  Too much to absorb in one visit."
267,Don’t skip this site,An unbelievably good job of capturing the events of a WORLD war that spanned five years as well as a fitting tribute to the men and women who saved the world — both in combat and on the home front! Had planned for a one day visit but soon realized we needed two days to fully appreciate the exhibits.
268,a must see,"WWII comes to life here.  The documentation, the artifacts, the technology, the storytelling, the volume of information, the size and space required a full day, and so intrigued we could have returned another day.  Helpful volunteers ...just awesome. Don’t miss it."
269,One of the best war museums ever,"We spent a few hours here, but it could take days. Thankfully, you Return for a lowered price within 7 days"
270,Beautiful museum ,It was a must-visit that I recommend to all families.  Be sure to arrive with comfortable shoes because you will do a lot of walking.
271,Super Learning Experience,Very educational; everyone should see what the price of freedom costs and the sacrifices they made for freedom. Make sure you have several hours to explore.
272,Average,"Movie is a must see, worth the $7 extra. Take your time. When they recommend 6 hours, that is the time it takes to fully appreciate the experience."
273,Blast to the past,"Great experience, good history lesson and the use of the dog tags to keep people (i.e. children) engaged is fantastic. Highly recommend the 4D movie and the submarine experience. If you only have time for one go for the movie. You can spend a full day here but, at a minimum, I think you should plan for 3 hours (1 more hour for the movie)."
274,Vacation ,"We started our visit as we were seated in an actual railroad car that would take the military to begin their service. This museum covered all facets of this war and broke out each area and got into detail about the battles, some of the officers and award winners. It was extremely educational which offered more than we had time to see. This museum is a must see for anyone that has any interest about learning about this war."
275,Outstanding interactive museum.,"This was an experience that we failed to do the last time we visited NOLA and were determined to not miss it this time.  This is a great museum.  The exhibits are engaging, and informative.  The whole experience is immersive.  It’s possible to do this museum in 2 hours, but to really appreciate it, I recommend 3 -4 hours.  There was something for our 13 year old, our 19 year old college student, and us adults.  Great experience, and definitely worth the time.  If you are able to cut out some time to do this museum, I highly recommend."
276,"Very interesting, fewer exhibits than expected ",I felt chills with every installation. Only negative is super expensive parking on top of museum price makes it a pricey activity. I would go again but prepared to spend more time to offset parking cost.
277,Utterly amazing.,"An innovative, interactive and informative experience which will keep you interested and enthralled for hours. The museum brings WW2 to life with its exhibits and videos. The optional 4D movie is a must and takes you into the heart of battle. For students of WW2 you cannot do better than to visit. A visit here will make a student of you"
278,Lots to see,"I'm glad its there, and we didn't have time for things like the PT cruise.  The way it was laid out did a good job trying to get you to understand what it was like in the Pacific and European war zones. Felt we saw all that was available in the 2 hrs we walked thru it."
279,Museum,"When in NOLA make sure to visit this important archival treasure. For those of us born after WW ll I think it is especially important to visit. One could spend days here so I suggest taking the opportunity to by a second day pass for just $7. Because of the Coronavirus & the closure of the museum I didn’t get to go back for the second day, but, I just consider it a donation to the museum. I was particularly surprised by the abundance of newsreel throughout the museum.  The film they show as you start the tour is informative, albeit a bit hokey in places, but a good way to start the tour."
280,Something new from Something old.,A must visit attraction in NOLA. Plan to spend 3-4 hours there if you don't want to rush through exhibits!
281,"Outstanding ""modern"" museuem of WWII","This museum has it all. If you are the least bit interested in any facet of WWII, then you must visit. We went when the museum featured the Ghost Army and it was fascinating. You can easily spend several hours here and the museum has a special fee for you if you’re going two days in a row. A must see."
282,Humbling,"An interesting insight to America’s entry into WW2, through the eyes of soldiers who fought and lived through the experience.Like a number of museums, this is interactive. From the start you enter a street car, enter details on screen and then be allocated a serviceman to follow via a dog tag. Going around the museum, you can enter your dog tag and see who or what your serviceman experienced.Good Boeing hall, shows aircraft and land vehicles of the conflict. If you suffer vertigo then don’t look down when on the top level.Leave yourself plenty of time, we didn’t!"
283,A fantastic museum telling a compelling story ,We were unfortunately limited in time.  We spent about 3 1/2 hours and could have done 2 days.  Its a can't miss visit if you are in NoLA!
284,Gigantic like “the Big One”,"Prior to our arrival to New Orleans we did not have this on our schedule.  So glad we made the time!  I found this museum very well done.  If you are into history it has so much to offer.  So glad the husband and I added to our list.  It is definitely worth the price.  I wish the movie would have been playing that Tom Hanks narrates, that was the only down side."
285,Plan to spend entire day here,"Not a the best organized or flow to see the exhibits.  Much repetition between various grouping and copies not originals of items.  Next to no coverage of Patton, Bradley or Nimitz.  Kind of disappointed."
286,Something for everyone,Loved it.a lot to see in one day.Be prepared to spend all day.Make sure you take time to watch the TomHanks movie.
287,Great place to visit,Everyone should absolutely see this... especially those who constantly put our country down and see what their freedoms cost.
288,Definitely worth a visit,"If Disney imagineers decided to take on a serious project of transporting an individual to the time, reality and mindset of the WW2 era and they coupled their ingenuity with the seriousness and research of the Smithsonian Institution museums, THIS would be the result. It is amazing. I learned SO much that i didn’t know. Every one was very helpful and social distancing. It gives an entirely new view of the valor and bravery of our military and our country. So much I thought I knew, but there is so much more. I was speeding through and it took three hours. That didn’t include the movie at the end."
289,Fantastic facility!,"If we had had the time, we would have spent the entire day visiting the Museum. So much historical knowledge with great interactive guides. Amazing adventures all the way around."
290,Too crowded and directionless ,I don't know if I could possibly come up with anything that hasn't been said about this gem.  One could not possibly come out of some of the exhibits without tears. I personally was moved by the D-Day exhibit.  One suggestion.  This place is BIG.  Pick two exhibits to really focus on and come back a second time to deep dive the rest.  Note that the Beyond all Boundaries and Final Mission segments cost extra.
291,A must for history buffs,Amazing very well done could spend a whole day here. Every think could could possibly need to know about WWII. Personal story’s of people who served in the war. Would highly recommend going.
292,Very educational and neat!,"The absolutely most comprehensive, instructional, and moving tribute to WW II and the brave men and women!!"
293,Excellent!!,"Very moving, hits lots of topics including battles, various groups affected (women, black, hispanic, etc.). Very informative. Movie with Tom Hanks narrating is excellent. Purchase tickets online in advance to make sure they don't sell out."
294,Humbling experience,"The French Quarter, Audubon, and City Parks, and the terrifically nostalgic streets cars all get the attention.  Tucked away, easy to get to from the St Charles street car line is the WWII museum.  Originally the National D-Day museum they expanded their scope and became one of the top 3 museums in our country, on par with the Smithsonian museums and the Holocaust museum.Professionally done, entertaining for all ages, and moving; the intensity and all consuming nature of the worlds struggle for freedom is well told.  I have returned 4 times and each time there is more to be discovered.  Don't miss this place."
295,Nice visit,"If you are at all interested in history (and you should be unless you want to repeat it) the WWII museum was fantastic. Lots of original artifacts as well as sounds and video to show you what our brave men and women went through and how fortunate the world is that they prevailed.  Could have easily spent a full day there, but it is a humbling experience. Thanks to all that served."
296,Great Experience,For two adults it cost us around $90 for two entrance tickets and two tickets to each of the special experiences/exhibits; Beyond all Boundaries and Final Mission. Beyond al boundaries was incredible and a “must see” that is certainly not over hyped. Final mission was ok but not as immersive as other similar experiences at museums. Exhibits and facilities were excellent - we even stopped into the Soda Shop 1940s diner for a chocolate shake before departing. We spent around 3 hours here.
297,Highlight of my Trip,"I learned so much that I didn't know about regarding WWll and I thought I knew a lot. Probably the biggest thing was the Ghost Army, that was utterly fascinating we stayed in the part of the exhibit for hours. It's a huge place and extremely well put together, I think it would have taken us a full week at least to go through it. Well worth the day we invested there."
298,Overwhelming...,Anyone with a passing interest in World War II will greatly appreciate a visit. Anyone with a deep interest in World War II will have no problem spending an entire day. This place is a national treasure.
299,WWII museum,All good but parking is a RIPOFF.  Do not go to first parking lot...pass thru entrances and go right to their parking lot.
