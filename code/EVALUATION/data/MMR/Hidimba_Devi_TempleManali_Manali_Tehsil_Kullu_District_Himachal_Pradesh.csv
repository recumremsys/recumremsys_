You can climb up a set of stairs from the riverbanks in Old Manali  and then its a short walk to its entrance. The beautifully carved exterior is replete with ram's horns along its exterior walls. Its unusual series of domed roofs are lovely. This Devi worshipped site is well worth a look. Unfortunately the pristine environment of my visit 30 years ago was sadly dashed by the current carnival atmosphere of horribly garbage strewn grounds, cotton candy hawkers, and a Disney themed blow up water slide feature crowding the area. I was severldy disappointed in how little respect was shown for the surrounding area and that absolutely no attention was paid to maintaining this magnificent and sacred site. One can enter the surrounding woods which are a bit less polluted by cast off corn cobs and ubiquitous fast food packages strewn about.  But it behoves the guardians of this historically important sacred site to reclaim it by restoring its natural beauty and sacredness by  addressing  the overcrowded and commerically overrun atmosphere which disrespects this wonderful historical site."

If one climbs up the stairs cut across the hill, then the scenery on both sides is awesome. Surrounded by forests, the sun rays play through the dark green conifers off and on while you can hear the call of monkeys and the chirping of birds while you pant  your way up. There are adequate resting places on the way so that you can take your time to climb up. The stairway starts fro the side of Hotel Rohtang manalsu.The temple generates a quiet, quaint feel.It houses the deity Hidimba who is a revered deity of the locals.The style of the temple made out of wood and stone is also different from other Hindu temples resembling a pagoda style."

169,Awesome visit to this Ancient Mahabharata time story,"We went to this place not to visit the temple, but for a walk amongst the cedar trees in Van vihar. It was like a dream. We walked among the trees, on the grass wet with previous night's rain. The air was cool and crispy. We crossed the broken fence across a small brook to step on the thick blanket of snow on the other side. There was snow everywhere. And apple trees enveloped with snow. Beyond the apple orchard were village houses, smoke coming out of their chimneys. Birds chirping, dogs barking, people talking. Beautiful view of snow covered mountains on all sides. How much more beautiful could it get? We stood there mesmerized, oblivious to the passage of time. We didn't want to come back. Reluctantly, we left the place, leaving a bit of our soul there."
170,Pleasant temple,"Very old ancient temple with its own rich history. Situated b/w a forest, well maintained even after hundreds of tourists turning up each day to seek Hidimba mata blessings.Queues to get inside can be pretty long someday, from inside it looks like an ancient cave structure.Not to miss if you are in Manali or haven’t been there before, located well in the heart of manali, more closer to Old Manali area."

186,Good visit ,It is very old temple with very hightet treesWith beautiful scenery And beautiful natureVery good place near temple to take picture
187,Tall trees,"Summary - Even Hidimba Devi herself would get annoyed by the level of commercialisation and indiscipline seen at this temple. 😒It could have been a beautiful place for worship and sightseeing alike if it wasn’t spoiled by the people who come here to visit. There is plastic and garbage scattered all around the temple and it is even hard to stand or sit quietly at a place due to bad smell. Sellers and vendors run after you all the time trying to persuade you buy stuff, and there is no regulation at all.* You can go for Yak rides near the back exit.* There is an entry (Rs. 20 per person) to Van Vihar from within the temple premises. There you can find some benches to sit on, but that too if you win the race against other tourists. 🏃🏻‍♂️* I managed to click a few good pictures.TIP: If you really want to visit this place and return back with a smiling face, try to beat the crowd reach as early as possible in the morning."

191,Hidimba Devi Temple - Heart of Manali Town,"Personal suggestion - go there with respect and appreciation for Devi Hidimba. Why? She could have brought up Ghatotkach as a demon however, despite being a Asur, she inculcated virtues in her son Ghatotkach who laid his life for Dharma. (Learn about his role in Mahabharat). What works:1. Awesome wooden architecture2. In the middle of dense Deodar forest3. Not far from the city, with easy approach"
192,Nice,"With lots of old and huge trees surrounding, this is tranquil. ONce you get inside the temple you realise that the deity is actually Maata Parvathy. A beautiful pair of footsteps of Maa is found there which is worshipped. You will be at peace with yourself in this place.."

201,Unique Shrine,"This is one of the few old Himachali structures left. The temple is not much if you compare it with other grand structures, but it gives you a feeling of a primal past. It is located on the upper regions of Manali. I would certainly recommend a visit if you like such structures. The ambience is beautiful. Unfortunately the day we visited it was a Tuesday, and Rohtang was closed. So it was incredibly crowded and we had to fight through a forest of selfie sticks. But still this is much better than the average commercial temples."

221,Amazing Beauty of Hidimba Devi Temple.,"It's a temple of a monster converted to goddess. Lush green surrounding, wooden temple almost a feel of Asian temple. Highly important place for locals. Don't forget to guess the height of goddess from her feet in the temple. There is no idol other than feet ."
222,Stunning ,This temple to me is a symbol of how a purposeful mother can produce a strong son. With the word that Hidimba mata gave to bheema and dedicating self for that gives inspiration to look beyond the construction of being. That’s the beauty of Himachal. Never hesitant of giving godly respect to the deserving. A nice place to be with history and some local food plus shopping.Bargain if you really want as locals depend on their selling success here.You can click pictures with rabbits to that held up by local villagers.Do make a visit here.
223,Unique temple,"Perched on a hill top it is one of the major attractions of Manali. The only problem is the narrow approach roads which pass through the main market. Once you reach on top, it seems you have reached a huge garden. The place is calm and serene and there is feeling of holiness all around.  The temple is very popular with locals as well as tourists and one can find steady stream of visitors. It is a must visit for anyone visiting Manali. It has a lot of history attached to it."
224,Temple with different architecture ,It’s a very small and ancient temple. The surroundings are breathtaking. Wish we had more time to walk through the forests through.

240,Good,"well managed Holy place.. neat and clean. nice scenery. In side the temple, you feel so peaceful. Nice wooden carvings.the day, we visited the temple.. had a little snowfall.. which was fun."
241,Beautiful place,It was a busy time when I went to this place Crowded and a long line to go inside the temple However the deodar trees and the ambience was good
242,Nature frndly ,A must visit place in Manali.. a peaceful place surrounded by pine trees..  good for taking photos and also for shopping of local stuffs
243,Hidimba devi temple - a rare temple with mythological significance,"Feel the natural beauty and peace. Tample is located between nicely maintained parks, just good for relaxing.."
244,Nice temple,On arrival you’ll be greeted by yaks!There are people offering having your photo taken with rabbits and lambs for a fee. The temple is ancient and beautiful. Can get very busy if you want to go inside but it’s a must see and do.
245,divine and peaceful,nice location . Template is situation at very nice surroundings. i love the ambience.its very beautiful and scenic.
246,Hidimba Devi temple,The landscape is eye catching. But the temple is not as beautiful as in pics.no entry fee. Parking is also free. There is trekking to this place also.
247,Heritage temple,"Definitely a must visit. A beautiful, aesthetic and quaint temple surrounded by lovely tall trees. The trails leading up to the temple, look especially lovely in the peak winter snow. I would suggest visiting early in the morning if you wish to avoid the crowd."
248,Temple of historical significance,Must visit iconic temple in between the most scenic and beautiful places with lots of crowd and happening place to be in.
249,HADIMBA TEMPLE,"the temple is amazing and the trees are awesome, i have never been to such beautiful place filled with long trees"
250,Nothing special ,It has nice experience to visit such a good place. Need a half day to visit it. This is my second time to enjoy the trip.
251,temple,"Around 2.5 kms from mall road.Better to take an auto from mall road, would charge around 100/- for 3.You may take a walk while coming back, there is a short cut with stairs which would cut down your half way till mall road.There is a small park, Dungri Van just behind the temple. Entry fee is Rs 10 per person, worth a visit.There are number of points which you can see in Dungri Van.You can click pics in local traditional clothes available at 50rs with the vendors inside the park.There is a coffee shop on top point if the park, you can try juices, coffee, Maggie, fruit chat, popcorns there. The minus point is that juice shop does not have proper juicer and uses a mixer grinder and have to pour water with the fruits to get a smooth blend. I also discovered that he mixed a lot of sugar in a bucket of water and used that water in mixer.Worth a visit."
252,Old temple... Nice surroundings ,"This place has my heart. One of the most memorable places I visited, try to visit in winters. This was the place where that shaadi scene from yeh jawani hai deewani has been filmed. If you are a couple this place will give you a comfort and a special feeling, get cozy and click some amazing pictures. If you are with friends you can chill around and enjoy street food don’t forget to eat Panipuri. If you are travelling solo as I was travelling you will surely get friends."
253,Hadimba devi temple ...very ancient temple surrounded with Cedar trees,This place has an amazing photogenic view which will capture your mind. It will be hectic to climb up if you're lazy but worth to visit.
254,Hidimba devi temple,"Its a beautiful sight, temple nested admist the woods. The architecture of the temple is impressive which almost resembles a pagoda. The use of wood make the outer appearance really impressive and beautiful. The entrance door looks majestic with wood work.Floor has stones laid and hence remains cool throughout the year. The temple premises has enough space to host a celebration or celebrate festivity."
255,Nice place,"The temple is really old. When you are here, you tend to feel some thing supernatural. The skills of dear and sheep’s is somewhat scary."
256,Darshan of Hidimba devi,Went to the temple and got our blessing. It was really busy but was managed really well. The temple had a very small door to get in so for someone who is tall need to be careful when getting into and out of the temple.
257,pretty after snowfall,Ancient and heritage site surrounded with huge trees and green pastures. Clean and green surrounding adds to it's beauty.
258,A few minutes stop...,"must visit place when in Manali, very scenic view and historical value. try to keep some time as during peak season it can get busy and can take 1-2 hrs for visit"
259,Scenic Calm however a bit overrated,"This is one of the places included in your itinerary for Manali sightseeing. The roads leading to the temple are narrow but the drivers are skilled enough to take you there. Once you get down from the vehicle, there are a series of steps to be climbed to reach the temple. The temple exhibits ancient built sculpture. You would find many people selling saffron but we were cautioned that these are fake saffron and not the real one. Surrounding the climb are streches of garden with beautiful flowers blossoming here and there."
260,Beautiful ,"The trees are amazing in this area, huge at the base and so tall. I wish they had allowed as walking through the forest. In the Temple area there are trees which we can touch. But the forest area is fenced.Temple is quite and old Temple, good to visit."
261,Abode of Tranquility,"A must visit place for nature lover. Go here early morning and immerse yourself admist the beauty of gigantic trees. The huge Devdar (Deodar) trees are magestic. A walk early morning is mesmerizing. The photo does not do any justice to the awesomeness.Visited in the month of September, I woke up early, took a morning walk around 6:30. The entire approach from Apple country resort to Hadimba Devi temple is a very memorable experience I will always cherish."
262,Photogenic Place ,it's a nice experience hotel is very good and its location is also good in the staff of the hotels is also friendly Mr Chetan thakur the manager is also familiar person the food of the hotel is very less and fresh I am so happy I will visit again Khushboo resorts Manali Himachal Pradesh
263,Popular temple,Beautiful place. Was there during snow fall time and place was fully covered with snow. One of the best experience
264,Ancient history,Nice historical temple in the middle of the forest. The environment is so green and cool sorrounding. Worth place to visit while in Manali
265,Peaceful abode of goddess,"Worthy of visit,even during peak months less people come here,u can spend some time and relax,the place also have religious importance."
266,Very Popular Hindu Temple,I went during the festival time there were a lot of shops and food stall and people were  playing music and dancing
267,Primal,"Nice and serene place. Must visit. Did not face any problem of traffic or parking, despite being peak season."
268,Worth Visiting,Best places for couples and side seens views so asm nice location and best places for visitors and all
269,Peacefull,"A very serene environment and the surroundings pleasant and quiet. It was an extremely cold day with rain and snow which made the long walk to the Temple a bit tedious - slippery underfoot. However the walk was worth the while. A small but spiritual atmosphere surrounds the temple. Unfortunately, due the numerous number of tourists trying to enter the temple, we were only permitted a few moments to make way for the others. A worthwhile visit. Do not purchase any 'goodies' sold at entrance to the park - poor quality and a waste of money. Rather give a donation to the temple."
270,Nestled in Deodar Trees,beautiful setting in the middle of the forest; beware the adorable himalayan bunny handlers that want to catch you reaching to pet and charge you 50 rupees - lol...  and the covert saffron sellers that are oddly peddling the spice like it is illegal to do so???
271,Hidimba Temple visits,"We started from the mall road by walking. It was 2 km hike and took about half hour. The place was surrounded by tourist to see the fresh snow from last night snowfall. The temple was so beautiful. Their is a park near the temple. We enjoyed their, took so many photographs. The weather was sunny and it was a great experience."
272,Calm and Nice place,The visit to this temple was good. But I would say avoid this spot if you are accompanied with senior citizens as it is kind of little steep walk and getting into the temple would be like getting into the small cave.
273,Quiet and serene place..,"My third visit to the temple. More impressed by the surrounding of trees, positive vibes post visiting the temple. A must to do when on visit to Manali."
274,A Must Visit Sightseeing in Manali,Don't take pics inside the premises. Too many options to take pics with Angoora rabbit and Yaks. Market nearby.
275,"Visit to Hadimba Devi Temple, Manali, Himachal Pradesh, India",Lush green peaceful place.. advisable stay minimum half n hr stay...to maximum of 2 hrs...  Must visit place
276,Not worth the visit,Only reason I visited it was because as a 12 year old kid I refused to go in without my shoes. It was cold that time.30 year old me now thinks I didn't miss much at all. So place is covered with greenery which is typical Himachal for you. It's good looking structure and quite ancient is want I was made to believe.I kept my shoe in the rack and went in. You just need to bend down while entering because the door is just 4 feet tall I suppose. And there it is. The deity! Around temple you would find folks giving you pictures opportunity with yak and rabbits. Some shooting games were there as well. Oh BTW ... you can either take the road to reach here or stairs. In my opinion stairs were much worse because it kills the breath in you. I'm not from plain region so for my body to breath in hills anyways is a add on task and if you add stairs to it. Dear lord!
277,Good place to visit,Wow this is the beautiful place which was near to my hotel i really liked the vibes and crowd and i liked the small shops around the temple. there was ice near by the temple. even after so much rush people were following queue..
278,A peaceful place to visit,we visited this place in march 2015 and it was all full of snow.Inspite of that there was not muddy or unclean.Hardly less than 1 km from the parking lot
279,Heritage site,loved it and amazed by the beauty. a must visit for one and all with family and friends  anytime of the year
280,Just like another temple,Location is very Nice.There is too cold ..Peaceful Place in middle of the forest.Here You can visit with the family & Friends.Here You will get large size of rabbits.
281,worship,Its a nice place to explore plz do not wear any kind of flat or heel please wear trekking shoes i have seen many newly married couples slipped over there
282,Devi in the Cedars,I love this place .. its pure .. In sep its not so cold ..you can enjoy the fullest.. its a place you can enjoy the nature divinely
283,The most picturesquence temple in manali,Simply awesome showing culture of the state.. Good to visit to explore religious side. You also get an option to be clicked with Rabbits..
284,Good Place in Manali,nice place in the lap of nature..though a bit crowded during peak season..enjoyed few hours here....
285,Goddess temple in middle of pine trees all around,We have been to this place fifteen years before. At that time it was really a serene and calm place. But whole scenario was different this time too much construction is being done during this last one and half year around this place. No arrangement for carrying old age people near to mandir. Hawkers pursuit you on the way. Rest is OK. Temple is built in typical old age Himachal architecture and gives you different feel. Cleanliness around the temple can be improved. If you are visiting first time then must go.
286,In the lap of nature,"Lovely place to spend time here, when we go their snow available,\nice place for photography, lots of enjoyment"
287,Good temple,Great location.in d modddle of tall trees..well maintained .felt good walking through footsteps ..park next to Temple also well maintained..
288,Hadimba Temple is one of The Oldest temple ,Visit at the early morning around 7-8 AM otherwise you'll find only crowd in your pictures. Also the morning is ultimate quiet and peaceful.
289,Beautiful Temple,It was good place to visit. Have been to this place years back. Liked the place. I wish they had not cordoned off the area of Deonar trees ..like it used to be years back.
290,Hidimba temple,Good atmosphere and vibe. Crowded place with snow covered area. Cluster of Larger trees make you feel more romantic.
291,Just Awesome,It is good for an one time visit.. Made up of wood surviving for more than 5 centuries it is worth a visit.. Its quite nearby mall road.. Autos run upto the place..
292,temple in the midst of pine tree forest in a serene environment,"Calm place with lot of tall trees with couple of very old temple. Need to walk little bit, but you can enjoy the nature"
293,Hidimba temple,high trees and good landscapeyou'll get tired by walking because of thin air content i think not much crowdwas raining a bit during my time of visit which made a good atmospheric feeling of moist and coolness
294,Beautiful,It was great experience for me. For the first time I have visited India everything was perfect except the weather
295,Beautiful place ,"Nice location, in midst all forest with tall 🌲, peace full place, need to walk a bit of steps to reach which can be very slippery if snowfall happened"
296,A must visit place when in Manali,There are a very few places I'd give five stars rating for but this has to be one of them and not just because of the fact that it's inside a park hidden among tall euclidean trees . But the mystery of the structure is what fascinates me . Animal sacrifices were a common religious thing in the past but this temple takes it to another level. In a place this ancient I'm absolutely positive that there was something supernatural going on there . And the best part about all of it is that you can also still feel the same once you're there
297,Serene amongst the shadowy trees.,scenic place with religious importance...............gives you refreshing feeling......at the backside you can climb up  the hill and can see whole Manali Town..........Near temple Deodar trees small forest is life time experience
298,Just Loved it,"It is not at all a quiet place, But somehow there's a atmosphere of Divination in it. My advice go early if you want to offer something to the goddess, otherwise good luck with queues. It has a garden on its backyard as well."
299,Awesome gigantic devdar trees,"The time to go, is when the light changes. When daybreak pushes it's head through the blue night skies....when the valley is wakening, and the locals are walking their cows to the forest or fields for grass, and tourists are still recovering from the previous day's wanderings in bed with breakfasts waiting in damp dining halls. The early morning is also the time you get to feel, to see the temple, the trees, and magic of the Dungri forest....uncoloured and unconditioned by swarms and queues of people thrusting forward with demonic deadlines of boxes to be ticked, selfies to be clicked, snacked to be nibbled upon, momentos to be grabbed, packets to be strewn...You can breathe in the cedars, with their warm pine fragrance, and feel the beauty of this holy space, and do away with all the concrete that's around, even if that takes a brief journey of imagination. (It used to be just earth, and the steps were but of soft earth that bore imprints of little feet running towards the temple, and then bigger ones, some determined, some hesitant. Concrete does not do that. Hold histories like raw earth does.)As the day progresses, the temple complex morphs into a giant commercial buzzing bazaar. The peace, calm and magic gives way to a frenetic tourist pace. You encounter sellers, pushers and peddlers of everything ranging from dream catchers to necklaces to selfie sticks, saffron, herbs, nuts, and holy bundles of Godly offerings...Locals in their homemade hand woven pattus mill around catching eye with their brilliant white rabbits...one picture with the rabbit is anything between a 100 to 20 rupees, depending on the time of day or your haggling skills. You can dress like a local, with the pattu and kilta, and that too can be bought for a price. Or sit upon a yak, or a combo of both the dress and the yak. That seems to be the preferred and popular option."
