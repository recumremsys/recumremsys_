0,An example for others to follow.,"Post Covid the national gallery has shown others how it should be done. They opened as soon as possible, the cafe is open and all of the exhibitions are open and well worth a visit. Yes you have to pre book but that is u fortunately life at the moment. Where other institutions complain, out reopening in the too difficult pile and get the begging bowl out, the National Gallery has got on with reopening. Well done."
1,Titian exhibition,"The National Gallery has wonderful art for all - its general collection is often superior to ""special"" shows at other venues. Very good Impressionist and Post Impressionist rooms."
2,Top,"MY wife and I visited the National Gallery in August 2020 and really enjoyed it.The COVID restrictions were well thought out, plenty of social distancing and hand sanitiser.The gallery is huge. For us it was all about the 3 Caravaggio's. The road to Emmaus was amazing. and we recommend a visit. We had  a great morning enjoying all the world class art."
3,Great,again a lovely exhibition at the National Gallerybooking in advance is recommended but they do have a ticket office for walk-ins - dependent on availability and time slotsthe exhibition has a cost but the rest of the museum is free - the museum encourages donations from visitors
4,Artemisia exhibition ,"This was a lovely way to return to visiting galleries post lockdown.I was very pleased when The National Gallery reopened and booked an open visit-something which now needs to done.The organisation is excellent- well done to the director and staff!The queue is not long, and everyone was able to enter at their allotted time. There is a choice of three routes to follow.I chose Route B, which includes the Flemish/Dutch Old Masters and The Impressionists- both favourites of mine. The route is clearly marked and the lack of crowding makes it so much easier to view the works clearly and at leisure.The staff are helpful and the whole experience is calm and relaxed.I have already booked to visit the Titian exhibition next monthAll in all, a perfect return to London's wonderful art world!"
5,Brilliant,"My wife and I booked to view two National Gallery exhibitions, ""The Credit Suisse Exhibition: Gaugin Portraits' and 'Leonardo Experience a Masterpiece'. These are expensive at £24 and £20 respectively so for my wife and I this amounted to £98. I was ill and unable to travel to the exhibitions in January so my wife and I cancelled our trip. Unfortunately, the National Gallery does not allow refunds nor an  opportunity to re-book for another date using the monies already paid. Inflexible! We won't be booking again, the most we would do isn just turn up but of course there is always the danger that tickets are sold out on the day."
6,go now and view the masterpieces in peace,"This gallery never disappoints. Whilst I am.intetrsted in Turner and Claude, the impressionist pictures are also worth viewing."
7,Could spend all day here,The National gallery is an art museum in central London Fantastic place they’re clicking and doing selfie I was impressed and satisfied by this gallery and painting mid of 13th century to 1900 year amazing collection I love this place i couldn’t complete visit whole place because I went nearly 5 clock not enough time.
8,Covid visit,We came to see the Titian exhibition which is momentous as the paintings in it have not been together for some 500 years but it only takes 30 minutes to see so we spent another 90 minutes walking around the galleries. We were told 50 percent is open but that is still plenty.
9,Wonderful Museum,National Gallery have absolutely got this right - we did the C tour - loved it. So helpful and positive. Felt very normal. Not over crowded. Calm and just what we needed.
10,Very interesting,"We have now been twice in August to this Gallery.  We live in London and have avoided it is the past as it has been so full of tourist groups that it is almost impossible to get anywhere near the pictures.  Not any more!You have to book online for a slot (free) & the slots are in 15 minute intervals.  That means that there are no large groups.  There are then 3 routes you can take - called A, B & C(!).  If you wish, you can do all the routes one after the other, but that would be somewhat overkill and exhausting.  You are not time-limited, so you could stay there for the whole day if you wish.The lack of other people varies room by room, but on the A route (the oldest art) I often had a whole room to myself (including the small Leonardo room).from early medieval to the 20th century.  Lots of famous names:  for example there are 2 room of paintings by Rubens.If you like art, then this really is the optimum time to go.The variety of art is exceptional -"
11,Lovely Artworks,"One of Londons great treasures a must do on anyone's list.Look out for special exhibitions, currently Nicolas Maes, which is also free! They are not all free but often offer a unique chance to view the works of masters."
12,Back to normal life?,"Have visited the tItian exhibition twice now. On both occasions social,distancing exemplary, staff are friendly, doing their absolute best. Lovely browse around other rooms too.i was unsure previsit about the route to take but an email was quickly answered with a helpful reply."
13,Lovely experience,"The National Gallery is without question one of the worlds great art galleries up there with the best Paris, Madrid and Vienna have to offer. There is just to much to see in a single visit. If you can manage it, it's best to come 2 or 3 times and view different parts of the gallery on each visit. As it's free it does not mean added expenditure.On this occasion I went to a ""special"" exhibition of Gauguin's portraits held in a separate building, which you did have to book well in advance and pay but it was well worth it, certainly the largest gatherings of Gauguin portraits under one roof I have ever seen. History seems to be judging the artist in a different light these days, if you judge him on his painting ability alone, he is a master. A truly wonderful exhibition."
14,Really enjoyed it ,The National Gallery is a great museum with free entry and is a good day out alone or in a group. It has many different wings with thousands of paintings including famous pieces such as the Sunflowers by Van Gogh. Definitely more for renaissance fans though as there is not much modern art.
15,Absolute must for art lovers.,"The National Gallery is completely amazing. An awesome experience from start to finish.Simple and efficient booking online, well organised queuing system for your allotted entry and friendly and welcoming staff.My visit lasted 3 hours and I can honestly say I enjoyed every minute of it. The building itself is beautifully maintained and the pieces of work... Well, stunning.I felt extremely privileged to be able to view and photograph so many canvases in such a beautiful environment.Absolutely amazing visit."
16,Restricted Covid tour of permanent collection,"Great place and great treasure of arts! Unlike other cities, London is putting art collections to such a separated museum where is a must to visit just after British Museum, or even before that. Plan for at least a whole day for that!"
17,titan exhibition,National Gallery of London is the best national gallery ever seen by my eyes. It has plenty of historical arts you should see with your eyes while you are visiting this great city.
18,One of the best spots in London,"Beautiful artwork, but I must choose what I want to see. To big to go through it all at one time. My teenager got a little impatient"
19,Glorious  gallery ,"This is such a beautiful space. The works are wonderful - as you tend to get with national collections - but the gallery is just put together in such a gorgeous way. I always love visiting.£5 for the audio tour Photography is allowed but as usual, no flashes or tripods."
20,"Amazing art, poor signage",I timed entry with no queuing.  Very pleasant. We need to support the Arts at this time. I can recommend this gallery.
21,Completely Breathtaking,"The National Gallery is an old friend, I have been many times and it gets better, the pictures are exquisite , and the shop is an amazing place for unusual gifts."
22,Exquisite Temporary Exhibits,"So many pictures to see, though usually lots of people in the National Gallery - especially when the weather is poor.  I love that this facility is available to all - no fee, just a donation."
23,Titian,"At the back of Trafalgar Square, this place has some priceless displays from all the Masters including Turner, Van Gogh, Constable, Gainsborough and Caneletto to name a few.This is a great rainy day activity as it's free but is worth dropping in anytime to get that culture fix."
24,Coping well with COVID-19 ,"National Gallery- an inspiring visit to Titian exhibition and more763243177The gallery has just reopened after the Covid19 lockdown. We were lucky to be there early on and booked to see the Titian Exhibition. Getting tickets means using their website- worked well for us. Be sure to turn up in good time however done come too early either.The gallery has good measures in place to cope with Covid19The Titian exhibitions had been affected by the lockdown. Fascinating to see these famous paintings painted over several years-and transported across Europe in the 16th century. No HGV lorries in those days!Worth looking for the National Gallery You tube video before you go as it explains so much more about the paintings.Then onto the main galleries and there are various routes to follow.I was particularly struck by 2 - The view of Delft after the explosion of 1654 and the Long Road. It served to remind me that disasters of all types have happened over the centuries. Also if life feels like we are all following a long road into the distance then for those who walked or rode a horse or donkey then lockdown was a real thingTheir shop is open. The cafe was open for takeaways only when we visitedFinally enjoy Trafalgar Square nearby - it is generally very crowded but for us the lack of crowds, clean air and clear skies was part of the experience"
25,Always pleasing,Whilst the galley contains the most amazing collection of paintings the staff need to learn to treat all visitors equally.I visited last week with my 11 year old (foster) son.  On two occasions he was admonished by staff for pointing at details on the paintings.  He was NOT touching them.  He witnessed adults doing the same thing and not getting told off.  As a result he did not want to look at any more pictures and sat as far away from them as he could.We left without completing our tour
26,Covid secure & well planned,The National Gallery is one of the best places to visit in London for art lovers and it doesn’t cost anything to enjoy the visual delights.It’s very crowded over the weekend and whenever it’s raining which is now unknown in London throughout the year :)A fabulous free treat in the heart of London that’s definitely worth adding to your list of best things to do in London.
27,Cool,We are so lucky to have the National Gallery with so so many paintings.  You need days to go around all the gallery. It’s a gem.
28,Brilliantly organised - felt safe and really enjoyed our trip ,"Just visited Titian exhibition - amazing paintings albeit very few of them -but the organisation is appalling which ruins the whole experience - clear example of a case when stricter rules just make it worse not safer nor more efficient. Tickets checked 3 times, everyone wears masks but the automatic door doesn’t work - so everyone touches the same handle, for some reason after presenting the tickets I was given a tiny piece of paper that I needed to handle to someone throughout the visit, no audio guide (and no app to download info) so people still crowd next to each other to read info next to each painting (so much for social distancing). To contrast - two weeks ago I was in Uffizi gallery - and that was really well organised and very safe."
29,I'd forgotten all the wonderful art here - it's free but museums are struggling so try & donate a little when booking,"Spent a very enjoyable afternoon, looking at the impressionist art and gift shop at the national gallery. It’s free to visit and we’ll organised. They ask for a voluntary donation, we’ll worth a Visit if you enjoy art."
30,Wear comfortable shoes !,I belong to an art group and we have been studying the use and effect of colour in paintings and were taken to see paintings that you might usually walk past on a short visit on your own
31,Great place to visit ,"We were pleased to be able to see some art after many months without a visit to a gallery.  The Titian exhibition was very good and was well organised from the Covid perspective at the arrival point, although inside not all visitors are quite so good at maintaining social distance as you might hope.  The instructions are clear though and fortunately with limited numbers it is fairly easy to find space to avoid those individuals."
32,"Amazing.  Visit from 30 mins to all day, depending on your time limit.",We went to see the a Dutch painting exhibition but also made full use of route C. Always amazes me that this truly fantastic gallery is  free / donation what a bargain!  The online talks etc are also so interesting and creative.
33,Dope,"My husband & I love art and when in London a visit to the National Gallery is a Must. Most appreciated was the free guided tour held by a very witty art expert - he described in detail all the various steps followed and the different materials used in Renaissance times to create the surfaces in gold in oil canvasses, an amazing and memorable visit indeed...."
34,A great free museum,"We visited The National Gallery which is an art museum while we walked about Trafalgar Square Christmas Market. It houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The Gallery’s collection is among the most visited art museums in the world, after the Louvre, the British Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.We spent about 90 mins going through as much of the gallery as we could but we could not see it all. Very nice and each room is color coded. Must visit and see."
35,Titan,"the permanent exhibition is great but the new titian temporary exhibition is outstanding, and don't miss the film. All their temporary exhibitions are a treat - the recent Gauguin and the upcoming Artemisia, not to be missed. Cafe is also delightful."
36,Top art,"First museum visit post lockdown. It was a wonderful experience being in the gallery with very few visitors but I think I prefer normal life with the crowds. This is a magnificent gallery, rooms filled with artistic treasures and save for special exhibitions all free.  If you live in London and love art it is worth becoming  a member."
37,One of the top art galleries in the World,"Due to Covid restrictions we couldn't go into the gallery but it looks really good from the outside, easy to reach and right in Trafalgar Square."
38,"Interesting, historic, cultural, artistic, varied","This is a free entrance museum and audio recorder available £5.This building in itself is fantastic - look up at the ceilings inside some of the rooms .We're not huge art lovers , but can't express how wonderful  the museum has cleverly arranged each room with art work dedicated to the different times of era's and brings history to life. The art work shows the way of life /clothes etc of that particular time - without being boring. Using the audio information is easy as numbered to select the numbered art work  in different rooms to get an  idea about the artists intentions when creating the master pieces.Too much to go through audio one by one - you'll be there all week! Just walk around each room and pick two or three you are drawn to and look and listen --you'll get hooked!!!Famous master pieces are on display - a must to see and we unexpectedly felt very special to be somehow, in the presence of all these talented famous painters .Highly recommend , but very busy if it's raining !!!"
39,Go while it is quiet.,"Returning to the National Gallery after lockdown is a microcosm of London itself: a cornucopia of cultural riches which is so easily taken for granted. It also helps that the more limited visitor numbers enable one to view comfortably each artistic masterpiece from the Italian Renaissance to French Impressionism and beyond without waiting for an opening in a crowd. Being forced to follow specific routes also allows focussing upon particular periods or artists rather than a random wander through the collection as a whole. Starting with the special exhibition of seven Titians mainly based on tales from Ovid’s Metamorphoses (Actaeon for spying the naked Diana turned into a stag; Jupiter turning himself into a white bull in order to seduce a nymph), I then moved into a room featuring other Titians and world by Veronese; then Canaletto, Hogarth and Gainsborough; perhaps the most famous paintings by Turner and Constable (The Fighting Temeraire and The Hay Wain respectively); then three rooms of French Impressionists, Gauguin and Seurat. And downstairs four rooms of a special exhibition of works by Nicolas Maes, a pupil of Rembrandt. And I almost forgot the rooms of Rembrandts and Van Dycks I had passed through earlier."
40,European Paintings over the centuries at the National Gallery.,"The national gallery is free which is amazing really. They ask for a donation as you go in which is fair enough. We went on a Saturday when it was quite busy. Many very cultured people spending ages looking at each picture and even taking pictures of the small explanation at the side of each one. So obviously some people think this place is the business! At the risk of sounding like I’m completely uncultured, there are an awful lot of paintings, many of which look fairly similar. (I know, I can hear many of you muttering in the background).There are some famous paintings in amongst all the others and those are the ones I wanted to see. However... I could have done with those being in a room all on their own.Sorry national gallery, you can’t win them all!"
41,No stress and we could see everythig we wanted,"this is an amazing museum which has some truly exceptional pieces of art from the prerenaissance through the impressionists.  The Titian exhibit was closed due to preparations for new exhibit.  Pieces by Botticelli, Raphael, Rembrandt, Van Gough, Monet to name a few.  Entrance donation is 10 pounds, and the audio tour is a must unless you already know it all or simply have no interest.  You need at least 4 hours to do it justice."
42,national gallery 24.7.20,"I visited the museum 20 yrs ago and went again last week, because of covid not as crowded as I remembered.You need to book before visiting. The new exposition are amazing, the art is the top outside Italy."
43,National gallery Brilliant despite COVID restrictions,"The National Gallery is a must for any visitor to London - art enthusiast or not. The halls of the National Gallery hold some of the finest (and most recognizable) artistic masterpieces.I visited the gallery on a weekday afternoon and did not find it too crowded. To help my untrained eye I rented the audio guide (provided by voluntary contribution) which was easy to use and provides excellent background information on the 30 highlighted paintings and many others. A free full color map was provided that contained images and directions to the highlights.I was able to view works by Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, Monet, Rembrandt and many many more. My personal favorites were The Virgin of the Rocks (Da Vinci) and Sunflowers (Van Gogh). I also visited works by Vermeer who was the subject of a recent film Girl with a Pearl Earring."
44,Caravaggio's Are Supreme,"The National Gallery houses a huge selection of paintings from around the world. There's something for everyone here, no matter how fleeting your interest in art may be. The gallery also has an excellent gift shop with some brilliant things to buy from postcards & notepads to books and t shirts."
45,Magnificent,"What can I say? They have many great art works there and social distancing went perfect. I would have loved to see more art from gay artists, or have a plaque somewhere that indicates that."
46,Lucky to have such a wonderful free museum,"Truly one of the world’s great art collections.  This is a museum to be enjoyed slowly.  Too many people rush through and miss some of the greatest treasures - including signature works by Rembrandt, da Vinci, Vermeer, Raphael, and Turner (among others).  Their dining rooms are a great place for a meal or snack."
47,Rediscovering a treasure house ,"I always like coming to the national gallery it is very clean, the people who work there are helpful and the things in the gift shop are usually quite nice. it might be nice if they had more of a variety of mini-prints in the gift shop, but mostly can appreciate the paintings in real life when you are there. The cafe has good service also and isn't as overpriced as some of the other museum cafes in London."
48,National Gallery- an inspiring visit to Titian exhibition and more,"A must if you like art and you are in London. Amazing gallery with superb art work. Went there because it started to rain, and it was the happiest moment of my tour in lonodon."
49,Incredible museum with immersive collections,"I visited to see the Titian and Maes exhibitions, which were both good. Although the Titian was set in the main galleries to provide more space for social distancing, this didn’t detract, though I was out of the exhibition before I realised. There were definitely fewer people and the Gallery was properly enforcing timed entry. And the art is pretty good!"
50,Amazing.,"A great museum with something for every art lover.  If you like Impressionism, the Gallery has a great selection; if you like other periods, they’re equally well represented.  A don’t miss:  The Execution of Lady Jane Gray by Paul Delarouche — superb!"
51,Lucky to visit while it was so quiet,"Can one tire of viewing famous old artists close up...and for free? Besides seeing lesser known but equally lovely and inspiring artists' works such as the beautiful, awe inspiring ""Whistlejacket"" by Stubbs or ""Pan and Syrinx"" by Bougher or the exquisite ""A Child with an Apple"" by Grueze and hundreds perhaps, thousands of others. Additionally, how can one not mention how the gallery rooms are designed with lovely colored walls and carved cornices and marble pillars extending so high. It is all a bit of a maze and it does one well to have comfortable shoes. Allow a goodly amount of time to properly see all the major works not to forget the outside of the museum itself with Lord Nelson looking down and the giant and majestic Lions standing guard. Many street performers as well entertain. A must see when you are visiting London."
52,A well curated visit,"Right in Trafalgar Square, this large art museum has an extensive collection with free admission (donations welcome).  We focused on the impressionist rooms and enjoyed the informational signage on each picture.  We spent a couple of hours, but one could spendf much longer.We saw, and spent time 2 very nice gift shops, and there is also a cafe and restaurant on the premises although there are many, many restaurants in the immediate area."
53,I Love National Gallery ,"We had taken a guide to explain ourselves better, we had a great time, but each time we come to London we will visit it, to do at least once in its life"
54,Well managed in current circumstances ,"We opted for just a part of the Museum. Very easy to find the areas you are looking for, but at some places it was a bit crowded and people were allowed to stand in front of the paintings taking selfies “for hours”"
55,A great opportunity right now,"World class gallery. And it's free!  It has been some years since I was here. So long in fact, that the last time I was here I entered through the main doors, rather than through the modern building to the left. Not sure what advantage to the public it is to have to enter via the modern building, because there is now a long walk to get to the gallery popular. Also, I didn't like having to walk past the official beggars just inside the entrance who  want you to pay to enter a free gallery that we already pay for through our tax contributions. If the gallery want more money, they should ask the government, not the people. Imagine entering a hospital and having the same experience. Not nice.   A donation box is fine, but the shouting beggars are not."
56,Opportune Time to visit one of the best National Galleries where service is with a smile!,"We are  so lucky that we can go to London and enter such places like the National Gallery for free.  You don't have to be a ""luvvie"" to enjoy this experience - there is something here for everyone.  In truth it is overwhelming when you see what the National Gallery has to offer.  It breathes history - the location, the building and the collections inside.  As I get older I appreciate more and more what has gone before me. Take time out to visit the National Gallery (more than once)."
57,National Gallery of London,"A positive side effect of the virus control measures is that limited entry means you get to see some amazing works of art with very few other people jostling for position. There were times when we were the only people in the room. A privilege, but also completely free (the optional donation when booking tickets is worth considering)."
58,You realise how amazing the collection is when you haven't been allowed to see it,"The National gallery museum is my favorites museum in London. If you love painting, that's the place!!!"
59,Titian exhibition - awfully organised,"Not many cities can offer a selection of masterpieces completely free.. So take advantage of this opportunity and visit the NG! Since entrance is free you don’t have to spend hours inside just to get your money’s worth: pop in to see some paintings, and maybe come back another day and look at another section. Italian masters are fantastic, great Turners and Constables and an impressive collection of Impressionist paintings! A good tip for quality gifts is the museum shop, it offers such a variety of items you wish you’d been there before buying all your souvenirs!"
60,Go back again and again,A selection of national art treasures always on show and it’s free. Also try the National Portrait Gallery next door. there may be a charge for some special exhibitions.
61,Best Paintings in the world....,"If you love art, then this must be your 1st stop.Having been to the Louve in Paris, the Uffittsi in Florence and the Googlehiem in LA, all havens of visual art, the National Gallery is the show piece of them all.Don't just use it to get out of the rain, take time to view some of the best paintings in the World by every World master.The NA is a visit to blow your visual senses and a chance to learn as much from whats IN the paintings as it is a joy to see Works of ArtOn the hot day we went it was almost deserted and absent with Covid 19 tourists. Go now whilst there's a new ambience of studying ......."
62,Good,So many amazing painting to see. There  is a one way system due to  social distancing so you have to pay a lot of attention to ensure you don’t miss any of the side rooms.
63,a must visit Gallery,"With a wonderful selection of art, right in the centre of London, the National Gallery remains one of the best places to visit on London.The special exhibition seem to be fairly expensive BUT are beautifully presented and worth the money.A must see in London"
64,superb,Went to see the Titian Exhibition and had a quick look through as much of the collection as we could mange during our visit.
65,Lots to see even if not all is open,"This gallery has art for every kind of pallet, I could easily spend all day here, albeit I had to limit it to a couple of hours."
66,Perfect Post-Lock-down Gallery Visit.,"This museum is itself a beautiful building - and the galleries inside provide a nice home, albeit crowded with visitors, for the artworks housed inside.The collections are expansive, which gives one many options. There are many major works one can choose to seek out, or one can just wander and see what catches your eye. Although I did have a map, I did find the navigation a bit confusing at times - so don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Worth a visit - just manage your expectations when it's busy - it can be hard to get space to enjoy the art work sometimes."
67,Interesting ,"This is another great, free to enter museum.Bursting at the seams with fabulous artists.But it is so overwhelming. We were in there for about 3 hours and it was more than enough, we had to get out for air haha! It is a rabbit warren of rooms that even my husband (who is excellent at directions) struggled to find they way.But saw Van Gogh's (yes I say it Goff) Sunflowers at last as it was on loan last time."
68,Cool from the outside,Just returned from a lockdown visit to NG. We went to see the Titian exhibition but also visited the equally interesting show about Dutch master Nicolas Maes. But most incredible of all is that you get to see everything with no more than 10-15 people in a room at once. Many rooms are completely empty and you have them entirely for yourself. Grab this amazing opportunity whilst it lasts.
69,Unique Opportunity,I always try to check out art galleries whenever i visit a city and the national gallery did not disappoint at all. The also have a nice shop to get your souvenirs
70,Loved the Gallery,"I came to see Gauguin Portraits, which was a paid exhibition. Simply fantastic! There are many other things to see - the place is full of treasures and a lot is free. Recommended!"
71,NEVER BUY NATION GALLERY MEMBERSHIP EVEN IF IT IS £1,I loved seeing the world through the eyes of the artists through history.Never been an art lover but my visit opened my eyes.
72,museum day,Very interesting and quiet. A real chance to look at the permanent collection on my own.  Very enjoyable.
73,Unique in the world at so many levels,Such a great time in the galleries. So much more peaceful and less crowded than I remember pre-Covid. Very well organised and clean. No pressure to donate unlike some of the museums and the staff were relaxed and friendly.
74,Great works of art,"Visited many times, usually to see a specific exhibition, but there are also talks of interest often relating to the current exhibitions. Loads of galleries showing art from different eras and a lot are free.  Once you've been here you will probably want to return."
75,Definitely worth a visit.,"We are indeed fortunate in London to have the National Gallery with its world-class art collections and programme of international exhibitions, which have moved on-line in the current environment. On of the joys, not to be missed, are the smaller exhibitions, often of more contemporary or modern work, complementing the main collections.  Earlier in the year, one such exhibition was of paintings and studies by the young David Bomberg alongside paintings he admired and was inspired by in the National Gallery.One was so controversial in its day – a study of Canadian tunnellers as a First World War memorial – that is was rejected as an ‘abortion’ by the Canadians’ art advisor.  You can understand why – it must have been challenging at the time; today we can admire the energy, power and darkness that Bomberg created in the work.Not only a link into the collections of the National Gallery itself, but also to other galleries in London which display Bomberg's work."
76,Great minimalist art installations,"This gallery has by far the best and largest collection of paintings in London. There is so much to see, I usually only visit two to three rooms at a time, coming back time and again to work my way around. They also have a handy 'highlights' guide, if you don't have much time and put on some amazing special exhibitions.The shops are also fantastic, with a wide range of beautiful  items for sale. I particularly like their seasonal Christmas decorations."
77,Many works,"Not been to the gallery and thought the time was right for a visit, i was surprised at the size of the building and the amount of artwork it held, ill certainly be going back to stand and admire."
78,Impressive,Most visitors probably wander through this amazing gallery without much planning but if you visit the website and study the galleries and do a little research into the individuals you will find your visit truly enriched--and may even discover some surprises as we did. This was our 3rd or 4th visit but so much more enjoyed by focusing on a few select galleries and having done some pre-visit reading.
79,AMAZING!!,Mainly go to major galleries for the impressionists. This gallery had a very small collection. They had some nice pieces but nothing like the Met or the gallery’s in Paris.
80,Poor,"Lovely gallery with over 2300 paintings , including many famous like Van Gogh’s ‘Sunflowers’..Always coming back."
81,Nice,You can only do a few rooms on a visit as there are so many lovely things to see in each add it to your visit places No charge so a donation is made .Too many beautiful ones to make a first choice
82,"A top 5  ""must visit"" location in London.",I visited twice the gallery. It's huge with a great quality and quantity of artifacts. The art is all over the place. It's a great choice. Just leave at least 3-4  hours for this if you want to see everything.
83,Incredible art collection,"A great display and the building alone is a work of art, you can get close to the paintings and really appreciate the detail that is in the artists work.Well worth a visit."
84,really large! turners are great,Beautiful setting and a suggested donation so pay what you can afford to! I was particularly impressed with their impression collection and some wonderful VanGogh I had never seen before!
85,Visit to National Gallery and its Restaurant - November 2019,"If you love art this is one of the best galleries in the world , a rich collection of art of the biggest names and best paintings , some of the most visited paintings there , Da Vinci the virgin of the rocks , Jan van Eyke the arnolifini portrait, Van Gogh collection including the original sunflower , the Embassador by Holbein and my personal favo the judgment of Paris by Rubens ( 2 copies one of his early time and one on the end of his carrier ) so you will see how Rubens improved himself and the technique :) And many other paintings , PLEASE GOOO , You only injuctice yourself if you don't do it"
86,Extensive collection,"Delighted to have the opportunity to explore the exhibition. Signed up for membership and tickets on line very easily. Arrived at alloted time and directed to exhibition, after leisurely visit continued on two of the trails and visited Maes."
87,Premium London Museum,This is an impressive building in itself. Added in with all the amazing artworks and you have a building full of beauty. You could spend hours here just roaming the halls.
88,Fantastic array of art,"With many Lockdown measures now having been lifted, now is an excellent time to visit London’s leading attractions and earlier today my wife and myself visited the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square.We had booked in advance on line and although there is no charge I would encourage all visitors to make a donation (we opted for £10 each and this represented good value for money).  All E-ticket holders are requested to assemble in Salisbury Street 15 minutes before their designated time slot and - with this in mind - there is nothing to be gained arriving any earlier as the queue control works well and visitors are called forward on schedule.After going through security, visitors need to go up 2 sets of stairs (there are tolets halfway up) and then should opt for a combination of the 3 routes (A, B & C) - all of which have an outstanding selection of paintings and take 30 mins approx to complete. Whichever combination is chosen, however, please do make a point of visiting the recently refurbished Room 32 as this is not to be missed!All in all, a most enjoyable visit - one enhanced by the excellent service provided by all the staff we met - and, hopefully, the Restaurant will be back in operation the next time we visit."
89,A must visit for museum goers,"First time visiting but well worth it to see such famous and inspiring works of art.Reubens the Lion Hunt is a very underrated gem.Booking system great as let’s in a set amount of people every 15mins so social distancing easily kept. A lot of walking and standing around looking at wonderful art you can stretch out and almost touch, wear good shoes though."
90,World class art collection with a programme of art exhibitions,"The National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery have a vast collection of portrais from all the best and most brilliant painters of all time. While you walk around the contless rooms displaying masterpieces you probably have never seen before, except in art books, you learn also a lot of the context, the history behind what you are seen. To visit the National Gallery is a must see for art lovers."
91,Excellent curation,Extensive collection of fine arts. We can only reccommned to visit this gallery. Great coffee as well.
92,Top Gallery,If you are a lover of art then this is a place you can loose yourself in but if you are not sure what constitues art (like me) then it mat not be up your alley.
93,Very interesting,"Our  'Post Lockdown' visit was perfect! From the queuing to get in, the bag check and stairs up to the toilets it was safe and welcoming as possible.  You didn't feel as if you were entering a 'COVID Complaint place as everything was done with the minimum amount of fuss and stress. I do recommend visiting the toilets before you start the tour to wash off all the hand sanitiser.We had tickets for Titian: Love, Desire, Death which was really interesting- but it was just one room. `I wish I had done a bit of research beforehand, but it was all well laid out with excellent explanations. We then followed Route C then picked up Route B and ended up in the shop and cafe for a well-earned cup of tea. They limit the number of people in each room so 'social distancing' isn't an issue and you are not peering over someone's shoulder. If you see a queue into the next gallery then don't fret, enjoy the paintings as you wait as the queue moves quickly.  An excellent few hours."
94,Facsinating,Amazing paintings and story. Somewhat let down by the unpleasant treatment received in the queuing process. I was told to move when I sat on a bench in the exhibition. I was told for the social distance to work I could not sit around but move on. I was actually waiting for the people around the 4 portraits to disperse to not crowd them. And I also wanted my group of husband and 2 kids to stay together.
95,Always a must!,Brilliant to see the old art works kept in such immaculate condition.  Loved the old masters and the setting is amazing and just as beautiful as the art works
96,Another great London deal,"If you are in London visiting or you live here, wandering into the NG is always uplifting and thought-provoking, It has a core exhibition of the greatest artists and some of the greatest paintings in the world, and for those who have already been a few times it's specific periodic exhibitions are unequalled anywhere in the world - the Caravaggio one recently, for example, was superb."
97,Take time to enjoy the masterpieces,An excellent way to spend a very wet afternoonSo many paintings to look at and all completely freeBeautiful building
98,Art in the heart of London,"The museum is a cornucopia for art lovers. Some of the artist exhibited are Michelangelo, Rubens, Raphael, Rembrandt, Gainsborough, Leonard da Vinci, and Van Gogh. Please get the audio guide, it often gives information on the origin story of many works of art."
99,Impressive,"In other countries, you have to pay for an experience like this but British museums and galleries are free for everyone. The great advantage is that you can just pop in for a few minutes to look at your favourite paintings."
100,Unexpectedly facinating.,"How lucky are we that our galleries are free? Impossible to do in a day, or even a week, but lovely to pop in regularly. Often there’s a short talk on a particular painting at lunchtimes."
101,AMAZING,"Having visited the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, I feel that this museum is quite disorganised. Partially due to the fact that they were doing restoration works in some of the rooms. The main highlght in the museum is Van Gogh's sunflowers and the Bathers at Asnières."
102,A Treasure,"I was impressed & satisfied by this gallery & it’s collections. really beautiful and interesting works. spent a good amount of time here. only thing was the signage was a bit misleading as to where to go to find a certain room or section, otherwise, this gallery is a must in london !!"
103,First visit for my husband and I.,"I have just come home from seeing the excellent Leonardo da Vinci exhibition which was cleverly laid out. A real insight into his work which was an altar piece but the demonstrative methods of explanation and history were stunning. We are members and so the £20 entry cost was not applicable to us but that is VERY expensive for a one-off, particularly as it is a piece of art they already own anyway."
104,Great on site guides :),"Free to enter, so no excuse not to stop in and admire all it has to offer. It can be a quick visit or easily as half day activity - totally depends on your preference and schedule."
105,Avoid the ATM in Trafalgar Sq  near the National Gallery,"This is a fabulous museum. I walked in as soon as they opened and didn't leave until they were closing. There is a wide variety of art from an assortment of artists, styles, eras and subject matter. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. While there was a lot of other visitors there it did not feel crowded."
106,Afternoon visit,"Exquiste, amazing extensive collection. A must see, especially for the Turner paintings. Right next to Trafalgar Square."
107,Must see in London,"There is lots to see here, historical and social history is captured on canvas, portraits abound, some you will know others are interesting to get acquainted  with."
108,a marvellous London museum for all art lovers,"One of the greatest collections in the world.  An incredible array of painters by all of the European masters. DaVinci, Rubens, van Dyke, Rembrandt, Constable, Turner, Canaletto, Raphael.  But my first reason for going is always to spend time in the impressionist galleries.  I think this diverse collection and the beautiful galleries/building that houses it are a must see for any art lover, but also a wonderful way to experience a gallery for the first time.  With free admission to the public every day and the central location of the gallery (hundreds of feet from the actual center of London) at the north edge of Trafalgar Square, it would be a shame not to go inside an experience even a small part of what the collection has to offer."
109,A must for art lovers,"I was finally able to visit this museum on this trip and loved it.  They show cased a Vincent van Gogh gallery, 2 unfinished Michelangelo's and 2 Leonardo da Vinci paintings.  I was blown away!  3 magnificent artist under one roof.  I will prob be back again soon to visit more parts of the gallery!"
110,Beautiful paintings,"National Gallery is one of my regulars galleries to visit in London. It is massively big with stunning art collection. the location is also convince in central London near Waterloo, Leicester Square and Piccadilly circus. I like Impressionist and Post Impressionist rooms and often rest at the cafeteria after a couple of hours visit."
111,Amazing collection,"Well presented exhibition taking advantage of Leonardo da Vinci paintings there to presents in a new and more informative way, reflecting the time of the paintings.  Reasonable cost and amenities there."
112,Lack of hand washing equipment ,Words cant express how much i love the national gallery. It feels like walking through layers of time from room to room. its a must see for anyone visiting London
113,Free entry,"It is a big museum located in the center of London, plan to wait to be able to access this museum, it is very interesting because it is varied, numerous art exhibitions"
114,"I know what I hate, and I don't hate this.",Be prepared to put a day aside to wander through this beautiful gallery with an extensive display of paintings by all the old masters. Thank goodness for the coffee/tea bars.
115,"Beautiful building, beautiful art","The National Gallery is always wonderful to visit as one of London's gems. To be in the company of the various masters and feast one's eyes is a gift, to do so for free is just unreal. The National Gallery requires multiple visits."
116,Impressive art gallery,Simply a must for any lover of art. A beautiful gallery with lots of space.Every visitor to London should visit this Gallery
117,FEELING LIKE A CHILD,"Located right off Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery is a must whilst in London. Admission is free, but special exhibitions require an addition fee. The architecture Of the museum as well as the collection itself are worth the time. The gallery with the French impressions features some classic pieces such as VanGogh’s Sunflowers.  Allow at least an hour, more if you are a serious art lover."
118,Saturday Morning Peruse,"A fantastic trip through the last 600 years of paintings. Really well laid out, easy to get around, and plenty of seats to sit and absorb the art around you. Classics from all the major artists of the times and many more on display. Whilst I prefer more modern art styles like surrealism, cubism and the like, there was still a lot here for me to appreciate. Tip? Start at the oldest painting first and work your way chronologically - you will notice the techniques and styles change over the years"
119,Incredible artwork pieces,Some things are so good they never change. The National Gallery never fails to excite. And it is free!!
120,Hundreds of super paintings,"Very different experience,having to book (still free) and follow a fairly fixed route, but as a result saw parts of the collection we dont normally visit.  Still one of the worlds best and now far fewer people just standing in the middle and videoing the lot in one room or having selfies with Botticelli !"
121,Always Worth A Visit ,"Free to enter, yet full of the most amazing pictures by the worlds most well known artist. My partner was crying with emotion as we sat looking at some of them. Just sit down, look at one area and focus on that area then slowly move out from that spot to take in all the hidden details. Loved it, this country can do some things so well, and art galleries is one of those things. Well worth a visit, and caters for children to, with art sets so they can try their hand at forgery!"
122,Amazing,there is so many things to see in that place that in one day there is no time! definately deserves a visit! the building is amazing on the outside ! same inside ! very helpfull everyone ! is a must in london!
123,Lots to see - lots of walking (lift available),"My friend dragged me in, many times in London but never through these doors to show me the Ambassadors .I was impressed, strongly recommend this Art Gallery"
124,Beautiful paintings,"I enjoyed an afternoon visiting 'old friend's (paintings) at the National Gallery. Easy to book, well organised and once inside you had enough freedom to wander where you wanted to - just like prior to Lockdown. Of particular interest was the refurbished and newly opened Rausing Gallery - magnificently restored and hung."
125,you have to go - just fabulous!!,Went with my partner after we booked tickets online. The whole experience was very well organized  with plenty of staff to guide us through the gallery. Its a fantastic place to visit and we spend 3 hours  looking at the artwork. Felt very safe re covid and will recommend happily. Thank you!
126,"Large, well presented art collection",Very well organised to control numbers of visitors etc I felt really safe and enjoyed a calmer than usual visitLoads of well trained staff on hand to help and advise
127,Best museum ever,"this was my very first post lockdown visit to this wonderful place,i met up with my daughter at our allotted time and followed route b(impressionists),its great to see art again especially canaletto and monet."
128,Amazing building ,This gallery offers a wide range of great masters. The galleries are stunning as is the art. Don’t forget to also enjoy Trafalgar Square after visiting the museum.
129,Cathedral of Art,"A rich learning experience. Breathtaking. Art through the ages. Paintings by Old Masters. I particularly visit 'The National Gallery' to see Impressionist and Post Expressionist artists like Degas, Monet, Modigliani and Cezanne and Chagall. I particularly like portraits. I enjoy pottierng in 'The Gallery Shop' and stopping for a spot of cafe lunch or a cup of reviving afternoon tea at 'The Cafe'. A great place to spend a rainy afternoon."
130,Amazing selection of beautiful art,"Fantastic place. A feast for the eyes with room upon room of famous, important art. There's not too much to say except that it gets very very busy at peak holidays and weekends. Avoid those times if you can, especially as hoards of people crowd the most  famous paintings.  But they're not really looking at the paintings. They're clicking and doing selfies. Entry is free which is great but obviously makes it a tourist pull. If you want to look at and appreciate art and longer go at quieter times or seek out the quieter rooms. There is a fairly good restaurant, a cafe and the usual shops. Actually they do some nice things to but with some reasonably priced gifts. Exhibitions are usually good but carry a fee."
131,An art lovers paradise,"Always a pleasure to go there, we heard the curator give a talk about mounting the exhibition. It was interesting but l found that it was difficult to maintain the interest for the whole time. I may not attend future talks of this nature."
132,Smallish but excellent collection!,"I chose to visit the Sainsbury Wing after reading an experienced guide's advice. This wing has a mostly pre-Renaissance and Renaissance artists along with the Dutch Masters, Reubens and El Greco. I paid for the audio guide (5BP) which was extremely helpful. I spent 5 hours in the Gallery altogether and was exhausted. I am sure the rest of the Gallery was as interesting as the Sainsbury wing. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!!"
133,Family day out,It is like to get in touch with history of art. Something you just saw in books gets real in front of you. Amazing
134,Great core exhibitoon plus periodic other shows,"Easy to find and great exhibition!  highly recommended. You can walk to Trafalgar Sq.Leonardo, Experience a Masterpiece is unique."
135,Artistic journey through history,"This museum is simply perfect, full of wonderful works. The staff is very kind. The gallery is very well organized and has unique priceless pieces."
136,A fantastic treasure chest,"So amazing to see some amazing artwork from world known artists. Even the children were amazed. The younger children didn’t enjoy it so much, so probably not recommend for them"
137,Fantastic,Good free space to visit. Lovely to see all the beautiful paintings but some of the rooms are just as beautiful. Good place on a rainy day!
138,A very large museum,"My favourite gallery, love the impressionists collection but have a great time going to wonder there on a rainy day and spending the afternoon cosy around beautiful artworks."
139,Popped in for a cup of tea,"Compared to most, one cannot argue with the quality and calibre of art displayed in this famous gallery.Definitely worth a visit for some of the most famous exhibits and artists of all time."
140,Amazing,Incredible modern minimalist art. I am a graphic designer and come here to get inspiration for my work. Great environment and family friendly. The cafe in the museum is friendly and has some great bites. highly recommended!
141,Small selection of impressionists,Very interesting analysis of the way L da V thought and studied the way light falls on objects. there are many displays and it all leads to his painting of the Virgin of the Rocks. A very well presented exhibition and worth going to if it is still running.
142,A must see place if you are visiting London,"If you're in the region of Piccadilly Circus, the National Gallery is worth a visit. This is quite an extensive museum with loads of exhibits for every taste. You'll view pieces like Sunflowers (Van Gogh), Venus and Mars (Botticelli), and Water Lillies (Monet). Even someone who isn't all that into classic art will see some exciting and recognizable pieces. You could spend all day here!"
143,Love the impressionists collection,"This is one of those places that has to be seen when visiting London.Its huge of course and its easy to immerse yourself into the spaces.The collection is very eclectic .We enjoyed a wide range of subjects , from pottery to fashion to architecture.The rooms were busy but everything was accessible.They also have wheelchairs for those with mobility problems.The staff were very friendly, and would often come up and suggest options and points of view."
144,Cultural visit,"The National Trust has provided the citizens of the world with free access to a global treasure. The permanent collection here is staggering in its depth and breadth. I can always spend more time than I have available and after numerous visits, I know I still haven't seen it all."
145,Still free!,"Another fabulous free gallery in London that is definitely worth a visit! Escape the bustle of Trafalgar Square and enter an oasis of calm and beautiful paintings for the afternoon! My daughter recently studied art history in high school so this was a must-see on our list as she adored The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck. What's nice is there is a range of time periods represented so you can view Medieval Art, Renaissance up through the Impressionists (Monet, Van Gogh, etc). so there is something for everyone! The gallery walls are painted in deep, dark colors so the paintings really pop out - a visual delight!"
146,Wonderful paintings with a good cafe,"Firstly making this trip with 2 boys who would rather be out playing sport meant we did not spend hours examining each piece of art. The gallery is free to enter so I was happy to make a quick trip rather than to put the boys off! I do however think everyone should spend something whilst they are there to help support this fantastic gallery. The plan was to use the shorter 80 painting audio guide but we soon deviated from it. (The audio guide was £10 for a family of 4) We made whistle stop tours to each of the earlier rooms talking about generally what we saw, ie religious paintings, dark, bodies, or landscapes. In some rooms we spun round and chose our favourite. When we fancied it we listened to the audio guide, we probably listened to a maximum of 20. We spent far more time on the more recent paintings. Some we sat and discussed whilst others we stood looking at the detail. We had lunch in the cafe whilst dodging a rain storm. The coffee was lovely and pricing was typical London prices but everyone was happy as we left to explore more of London. Many people may not have visited a gallery or may think it would be boring. I think you should give it a go...... head for the 10 most famous pieces and just see what you think of them!!"
147,For the love of Art.,"This is a great free venue in the heart of London, metres away from the Tube and opening onto Trafalgar Square. It has a very impressive range of artworks and sculptures from all ages. Free entry and a great restaurant. Not cheap but you can sit there for hours and chat to friends,"
148,Simply Amazing  A must see and its free!,"A must see when in London. Masterpieces not to be missed by art lovers.Entrance is free for main exhibition, cloakroom costs.There are National dining rooms in the same building where lunch and tea is served."
149,Wonderful gallery in a beautiful area,"Given it was a rainy day the gallery was quite busy with a line to get in however as it is so big with so many rooms this was not an issue at all! The art and the history behind it was just amazing. Best of all its free! Highly recommend if you like art and even if you don't, just pop in and check out the grandeur."
150,Great place to visit,"It’s free, the staff are friendly and above all the art on display is first class. Highly recommended."
151,Fab...but no Sunflowers!,"Lovely building packed with world art, always a pleasant afternoon, wander around and wonder at the history on display. Nice cafe, shop and toilets too!"
152,Spontaneous visit,"Ironically I'm not one for art, but enjoyed seeing some famous works whilst there. However, the building itself is absolutely sensational and a work of art itself. Worth a visit for the architecture alone. Free entry."
153,Beautiful artwork from around the world,Plan one of two galleries before or after lunch in the Gallery restaurant.  There is so much to see.  You can always go next door to the National Portrait Gallery if you still ahve time.We did see a bunch of tourist walking through the gallery videoing everything on their mobile phones!!  No comment!
154,Gets busy on Wet days !,"We had some time to kill before the theatre, and loved spending time in the gallery. Amazing to have free entry & will be back to see more."
155,Recommend a visit!,"The galleries are excellent, staff extremely knowledgeable, this was a pleasure to visit and view. However we did visit after 2pm and found there was no soap or hand cleanser available in the toilets,  with the threat of a contagious virus and signs warning us, found the lack of basics not acceptable, and especially as the gallery was down on footfall so less people using the services."
156,Lots to see,"Gorgeous museum with incredible art, but do your best to pick an off peak time to visit.  When I visited It was so crowded it was miserable. I was thrilled to see what little I could before the massive hoard of humanity drove me out."
157,Beautiful Architecture & Artwork,A fantastic collection of art from across Europe that spans centuries of work. It's a great way to spend a rainy afternoon in the heart of London!
158,World class gallery. And it's free! But you have to walk past shouting beggars.,"Busy Sunday, Chinese New Year, Trafalgar Square rammed with tourist great atmosphere v.noisy.Inspiration, get a cup of tea and a seat in the National Gallery.Lovely cupa, 'weight of my feet for 10 minutes followed by probably the best free art exhibition in the world."
159,An art museum for everyone,We paid a brief visit with it particularly art loving teens. All found something they enjoyed. Well worth a visit.
160,Good variety of paintings,"This is one of the top art museums in the world and well worth a visit even if you don’t love art. There are some famous pieces here that are must-sees like the Velasquez Venus and some other exciting pieces like the Gentileschi works (father and daughter) which are highlighted by the excellent guides. Many museums have excellent cafes but we were dissatisfied with the main dining hall here-overcrowded and not appropriate for people with allergies or vegans. But really, it’s London, get your food elsewhere! If you come in from Trafalgar Square, take time to walk down to the fountain and take pictures; it is a great view!!!"
161,A must-see!,"One of my favourite places to visit, have to go everytime we go to London, perfect building and easy to navigate."
162,Enjoyable afternoon,National Gallery is a nice place to visit. Tourist tip: don't use the ATM in the Square. Clever crooks using skimmers and hidden cameras . Fellow tourist was scammed
163,Busy but great,"My favourite museum in London! Situated in the central Trafalgar Square, it contains unique collections and pieces of art that only there you are able to find. Van Gogh, Vermeer, Monet, Rubens, Rembrandt, Michelangelo, amongst many others famous artists have some of their work here. Definitely recommend!"
164,"Beautiful museum, huge collection of works",really large gallery. really came here to see the turners which were fantastic. the monets too were really nice. I think I'll come back to the cafe for lunch one weekend when this is over
165,Great art for free,"There's something for everyone here and because entry is essentially free (donations gratefully accepted) , one can spend a short time viewing selective paintings of interest within an hour. We aimed for  Sunflowers by Van Gogh and Ballet dancers by Degas. A very enjoyable experience."
166,One of those London experiences,This is such a great experience. Just the area around the gallery is so nice to visit - it is touristy but also has the Canada house just right across it. The trafalgar square is also amazing. The gallery itself is awesome as well. There is no cost to visit but you should truly make sure you have time to go through all the floors.
167,Exquisite,It's free to get in and what a national treasure it is. Several floors of beautifully presented works of art. You can get So close to really get a good look.
168,A masterpiece!,"Too much simplistic bunf, and not enough deep communication about context and technique. The weird opening room setting geographic context simply didnt work. Why should Trustees spend more than a million pounds to 3rd parties for a so-called interactive exhibit that is so second rate?"
169,Alot of famous paintings here!,"You can't see great art like they have here for free anywhere else in Europe. If you can, go on a Friday when they are open later and end the day at closing."
170,Fantastic and huge collection great museum ,"Wow, what shall I tell you: NEVER BUY ANY MEMBERSHIP FOR NATIONAL GALLERY! Why? Because I've purchased my membership at the end of January 2020. I have seen 2 very crowded exhibitions (paying entrances were over £20) even though I have booked my time? Restaurants even with the membership discount are sooooo overpriced! Then the COVID-19 happened in March 2020 and I have not been able to benefit from paying for my membership. I have emailed about 4 emails to them asking them if they could extend my membership for free for 3 months? They were delaying their answer and cheekily someone phoned me recently before they just opened, asking me if I would be happy next year when I renew my membership to have 3 months added? I said NO AS I AM ASKING IF MY CURRENT MEMBERSHIP COULD BE EXTENDED BY 3 MONTHS...So for that reason I will never ever renew my membership with NATIONAL GALLERY..probably it is not worth it to pay over £70 as they have no more than 3 good art exhibitions per year anyway and the rest is free to see inside the gallery.."
171,Soul food,Fantastic museum to go on holidays or day off. Have a good bar and restaurant inside to eat. Enjoy !
172,Must see in London ,One of the best art galleries I’ve ever been to-really interesting array of paintings sculptures and artwork. Interesting for everyone as they are so so many rooms and many different artists included.
173,This is an unexpected journey through history,I have always enjoyed visiting this gallery as it is such a beautiful building and always reasonably priced with such amazing art work. Always feel uplifted afterwards and can then enjoy the surrounding area which also has much to offer.
174,Art for everyone!,The National Gallery is well worth the visit.  We spent about two and a half hours there and didn't see it all.
175,Wonderful,If you care about art and stuff its must see thing. Its like a maze in there but security guys were helpful since they don't have anything to do anyway. You can buy some pics on place.
176,A national treasure,"During our visit to this gallery, we liked it a lot, it was very interesting and we came away conquered"
177,Great Art,The Gallery is beautiful from inside and even more beautiful from outside. Absolutely loved it! It's full of amazing art.
178,Stunning Art collection,We visited here first time and it was great experience for us . All the arts are going n different rooms and every room has their wall color according to arts that make the arts looks even more interesting !!
179,Amazing,I have been so many times and also a member for years. It is a home to everyone. It is such a welcoming gallery and you can enjoy all sorts of styles and still love the architecture of the building. A must-see.
180,"Nice art, BIG!!!","Right on Trafalgar square, the National gallery beckons, but I rarely respond. This time I walked in. If you have a taste for the classics, you can spend a  few hours with Van Eyck, Velasquez, Rembrandt, and the like. I think more modern fare than the grand masters of yore would not go unappreciated, but this us definitely a must."
181,It's always better to see it face to face,We are so lucky to be able to see such art for free. The cafe is also a gem offering good cakes and light meals. The shop has so much to offer.
182,Fantastic ,A total must-see for art lovers as well as those who don't usually visit galleries. It contains some of the most famous masterpieces of European art. Don't delay your visit. Its free. No excuse.
183,Utterly stunning art.,If you love paintings then  you would love this place and you could quite easily spend 2-3 hours. The paintings are absolutely mesmerising  and appealing to all ages. The Gallery  encourage School trips and run exciting workshops.
184,Jetlagged but awakened by masterpieces,"We went early - 10am at opening time and walked straight in. Make sure you go round in room number order, or you could miss half the gallery out.  I went for the Turners and Van Goghs.  So great stand inches away and imagine the brush strokes being applied!  A great cheap way to spend half a day."
185,Wonderful gallery,"It's really interesting , you should check it out! A great experience  if you love art! You won't be disappointed."
186,Over Officious Staff,"Lovely place to spend an hour or two,. Great art and nice cafe. Amazing that it is still free of charge!"
187,Must see.,I was looking forward to something enjoyable but I didn’t find it very nice I must say I was expecting more😤
188,Great art,The art in this architecturally exquisite building is grouped by era so you can spend the whole day wandering through the galleries or just skip to the era or artist you’re interested in. The museum houses some famous art such as Van Gogh’s Sunflowers and Monet’s Water-Lily Pond but it also has other beautiful paintings such as Van Gogh’s ‘Long Grass with Butterflies’ and Gauguin’s Faa Iheihe.
189,Look don't click!!!,"I absolutely loved it. The on-site guides are knowledgeable and kind. I appreciated how they suggested additional works of art based on my particular interests. It was well worth my time to visit. There is so much material on the free access floors, but I would gladly make a donation on a regular basis or pay for the special exhibits. The description of the paintings was much more robust and engaging than other museums I visited."
190,Very extensive museum,"A superb gallery with loads of my favourite paintings. Turner, Constable, and loads of places to sit and admire. The cafe there was great too. Nice pot of tea."
191,No surprise-great collection!,Just great. Loved impressionist section. It might take more than a day. can't miss it and it's free!!!
192,Quick Friday night visit left us wanting more,"This builkding houses some very famous paintings from some very famous artists.Definitely worth visiting, even if its to rush around for 30 mins.If you are trying to fit this into a busy day, then ask the staff where the most famous paintings are and you can see the 'best' of the museum in less than 30 mins  ;)"
193,"amazing collection, busy","everyone must go here at least once in their life!! Art work by such famous people, and it's on the walls in front of you and it's free, whats not to like - it's just amazing and you must go!"
194,Amazing,Fantastic exhibition.  Guide booklet for this exhibition is so easy and informative.  It was such a great pleasure.
195,A touch of enlightenment away from the shopping,"This is one of the best collections of classical art in the world containing works by da Vinci, Rubens, Michaelangelo to name a few. There is an extensive pre-Renaissance collection in the Sainsbury wing that is most enlightening. It is a big collection and takes a good day to wander around casually. Enjoy."
196,Cut to the best bits,Great collection!  Great way to spend a rainy day.  Especially enjoyed the Van Gough.  I highly recommend.
197,Light lunch.,"We were in the area after eating at the Cafe in the Crypt (we highly recommend!) and dropped in. Because it was the end of a long day at the end of long week, we weren't able to stay long (my kids are 9 and 7). We all wanted to see more but did see some pieces by artists my kids had learned about it school. They asked to go back, but we had to leave the next day. We will definitely go back our next time in London. It is also a great chance to hang out in Trafalgar Square and take the 15 bus to see some sights."
198,Stunning and amazingly still free,"Can you remember when your dad used to take you to the museum? well, this is the right place where to remind that nice experience..."
199,Lovely,"So many beautiful paintings. We're so lucky to have such a wonderful Art Gallery, freely available. Great to see famous paintings close up, too much to see in a day!"
200,If you like art - this is THE place to visit,small display but still enjoyable. Well sign posted for safe distancing. Was able to safely visit rest of the museum safely
201,Great Gallery,"Magnificent pinoteca smaller than the Prado or the Louvre. In a spectacular building in Trafalgar square. From works by the most important European painters such as: Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt, Velásquez, Monet, Manet or Vincent van Gogh. I would highlight the Virgin of the rocks and the Sunflowers. Visiting this gallery in London is a must. Free entry all the time."
202,Great way to spend a few hours,"I enjoyed the Gaugin Exhibition very much.  However, one thing I did not enjoy was my visit to the restaurant afterwards.  It was  dimly lit and very uninviting.  I decided to order a small pizza which cost £7.90.  When it was delivered to my table, I could see immediately that the pizza had been overcooked because the crust was dark brown.  I attempted to cut a piece off to eat it but was unable to get my knife through the pizza. I turned it over and could see that it was black underneath.  I then asked to see the Manager and showed it to him.  Simultanelously I asked to get a refund because I was not prepared to accept this as an edible pizza.  He then returned to the cash desk and refunded my money.  He did not apologise to me, which I thought was totally unacceptable.  I could not in any way recommend this restaurant."
203,Great and Free!,"Visited on a very windy, rainy day! Wasn't as busy as i was expecting but think the weather played a part in that, so was nice to be able to wander round without too many crowds. Was very impressed by the young gentleman member of staff who pointed us in the direction of Da Vinci's 'Virgin of the Rocks' as we wandered into one of the rooms, i wasnt even aware there was a Da Vinci in the gallery so i really appreciated being informed about it! The only thing that let our day down was when we asked a young lady on the membership desk if there was an area where we could eat our lunch we had brought with us, my partner was meat with a shrug of the shoulders and ""Not Really"" as answer!"
204,If you love art don’t miss this place!,"Totally worth visiting, the gallery is beautiful full of amazing pieces. The fountains outside of it are a great place to rest afterwards and enjoy the city."
205,Loved it,"Full of quality works of art, you could spend hours wandering around the galleries, and free, although this is worth £10 each time you visit"
206,Amazing,"There is security screening before you go in, but we didn't actually go to the gallery - we just used their clean amenities which were to the right of the screening process.  Imposing building set in Trafalgar Square."
207,"Full of very impressive art, great building too.",It is free and the exhibition is excellent. I love spending time there.I am a fan of Monet so that's a plus.
208,National Gallery London is a visual treat for art lovers (and it’s free),"Trafalgar Square is very impressive - it was only 10min from Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace! There is also the sublime National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery and there are always shows or activities for every occasion including Chinese New Year, Christmas, Hanukkah and even demonstrations where people cry their hearts out on stage below Nelson’s statue.Finally Trafalgar Square is what it’s name says - I personally love that the statue of Nelson is face to face with that of Napoleon in Paris. An old rivalry so close to British politics and heart. And, if I’m not mistaken it is just a few minutes walk away from the famous Savoy hotel! Who’s name comes from the Palais de Savoie which previously stood in its place and was The designated place for French foreign royal emissaries to stay when they came to visit the British Crown before the revolution of 1789. Perfectly located between Westminster and The City.A great visit and must see for any person who wishes to have a feel for what London is about."
209,My fav place,"Not only are the paintings wonderful but to is the building itself, I particularly enjoyed the Vincent van Gogh paintings."
210,Fantastic Experience,I've been to the National Gallery a few times in my life now and I can honestly say every time I go there is always a new part of it that I discover. If you like art the National Gallery is definitely a place to visit. The collection is huge!
211,Worth for visit,Art collection is magnificent and you can explore it in a relaxed atmosphere while choosing some of the exquisite gifts from the souvenir store.
212,Preparation beforehand a must,"If you are in London go here so much great art for free and very informative. Some exhibitions are chargeable, but you have the option.Cafes/restaurants offering snacks with drinks to cooked meals for both the hunters and farmers.Adequate seating in each hall/room should you need to take a rest."
213,Saturday 16 February 2020,I Have no idea who painted this but it was nice I guess :) I don’t think that I would dropped in if it was an entrance fee- so Thank you London for this. Off course we bought some things in the store :)
214,Unsure...,"This place is a huge sprawling space. Trafalgar Square is always teeming with tourists. So it is really crowded. I happened to be there on a day when the population was scarce. One just gets an idea of how big the place is in the center of the London. There were street artists performing there . A bagpiper was there playing a melancholy tune. The National gallery inside is large with a lot of paintings. And I think one day is not enough to see everything. There is no entry fee. There are small eateries inside. So one can relax and take a break from continuously gazing at the canvases. Th know a little more , read London-Life around the Thames at Papumashi the Nomad."
215,Such a great place!,What a brilliant exhibition. So well displayed with so much attention to detail. I learnt a lot of new information about Gaugin and saw some pictures that I'd never seen before. Wish it was on for longer. Finished today.
216,Terrific as always,"The art that me and my saw was absolutely stunning. Some of the paintings are jaw droppingly beautiful. We spent two hours in there, Entering the building from the right hand side as you look at it from the square outside. Even after two hours it felt like we only scratched the surface.Even if you are not a fan or art this place is free to enter. Honestly one of the best places i have ever visited in London."
217,very particular museum,It was so great to be back! London was quiet but that did not spoil our day at the Gallery. Very well organised outside and inside so you feel safe and are allowed to admire the masterpieces the way you used to do. And the Shop was open too!
218,A WHOLE LOT TO SEE for FREE!!!,Vow. If u r an art lover its a place u can spend a good 3-4 hrs. Its not as huge as louvre. For me the main attraction was impression art section.. vincent van gogh
219,Cool museum and it's free too!,What? It's one of the great galleries. So much to see - leave yourself a good couple of hours. Take your tim. What do you want? Caravaggio? Canaletto? Leonardo? Boticelli?Valezquez? VG? Do you want Rembrandt? Turner? Degas?Yeah - here's where to go...
220,National collection of classical art.,"Even a 45 minute quick dash around this amazing gallery is worthwhile - but if you have the time, stay for a full half day. It's a feast for the eyes and the soul."
221,The best place to go when its inclement weather in London,"I have been here numerous times, one of my favourite locations. London is a great city, make sure this attraction is on your to do list!"
222,London's best painting collection.,So many great masterpieces and there is no charge to enter.  Right in front of Trafalgar Square  and so close to Chinatown with all the great food
223,Most disappointing Michaelangelo exhibition- rip off,"Wonderful museum, free to enter but we were happy to leave a generous donation. Particularly enjoyed the impressionists - sadly Sunflowers was out on loan. Also great to see several great Turner pieces and enjoyed the Canaletto's. All in all a great place to visit, terrific building and a superb location."
224,National Gallery,"It's amazing. Some of the greatest masterpieces in the world are here. What more is there to say? Not, as in some galleries, minor works by great artists and great works by minor artists, but major works by major artists. The Holbeins are superb, the Caravaggios, Michelangelos, and the Leonardos there aplenty. And it's free."
225,Worth every minute I spent there.,A great visit. Beautiful rooms and really amazing art works.Social distancing was managed very well thanks to well sign posted one way routes.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Stunning location at Trafalgar Square.
226,A GOOD PLACE TO POP IN AND OUT OF,A great way to spend quality time in an environment that inspires and never fails to impress . Try to walk all the halls as you may miss a treat
227,Stunning,as per my title i found this museum very particular . A lot of very interesting stuff to see. especially my wife enjoyed it so much .I am happy i visited it
228,National treasures,"Pre-booking a time slot was the way to my heart and this proved to be a fantastic way to see the incredible works of art. Three different routes around the gallery ensured that you didn’t miss anything (unless you wanted to!). Face coverings were required, but some people seemed to have rejected them by the time it got to the Impressionists. However, it was great to be able to feel safe - and there still weren’t too many people."
229,Great works of art for free,"I had an hour or so to fill around Trafalgar Square so I popped into the National Gallery. I had a coffee and cake in the cafe which were very nice and then had a wander around the Gallery. I love all the old Masters. There are some beautiful paintings. Very good place to dip into and out of, with a nice restaurant and cafe."
230,An astonishing free resource,"Great place to see works of art, got very busy due to the weather outside (feb2020)Its free but hassled (I feel overly) on arrival for a donation, then you have to pay £2 for a map.I'd rather make a donation either when getting a map or after I've seen what is on offer (5*s if you get rid of the hassle on entrance !)Did not eat or drink as it was too busy at the timeI'd go back but when the weather was nicer so not as crowded inside"
231,Free attraction!,I was visiting Trafalgar Square and decided to take a quick peek at the Gallery before stopping in their cafe for a cup of tea.The Gallery is BIG but easy to get around with a wide array of art on display.The cafe was busy but I scored a window seated and enjoyed watching the world go by.
232,The gateway to Westminster!,Definitely a must see if you're visiting London. So many great works of art are located here and all are available for a donation. Allow yourself a minimum of 3 hours to go through the museum to really enjoy what it offers. You will see amazing works of art from the masters.
233,Second visit,Having only become vaguely interested in art in the last year or so (I am early fifties) I had never visited before but my wife and I had a wonderful 2-3 hours walking around fairly haphazardly and thoroughly enjoying this time.How privileged we are to be able to enjoy such fine art for free (donations welcomed). We will definitely go back but maybe with more of a plan as there is so much to enjoy. Worth noting it is open later (9pm) on a Friday.
234,Incredible,An amazing exhibition of over 50 self portraits . Astounding works of art . His portraits cover his life from teen to in his eighties which is remarkable .
235,Don't try and see everything in one visit. Concentrate on just a few rooms,I was shocked that this fabulous attraction was free!  I would definitely have paid visit this fabulous gallery.  We spent nearly 2 hours roaming the various exhibits and still had more to see.  We did not have our kids for this trip as it was just adults but we will definitely be back with them.  Unheard of to get something for free these days.  A MUST SEE for anyone visiting London!
236,A walk through history,we loved going it for a cultural trip in london so we would go again for the next time we visit the city
237,The Art of Us,"There is not much in life that’s free but this is still something special. For an uplifting experience that feeds the soul then the NG still amazes me every time I visit. as well as the art the building itself amazing, take time to look at the architecture. They have updated the shop which is also very good. If I had a criticism it’s the dreadful concoction of ‘hawkers’ outside. No problem with some of the real talent but 2 Yoda’s and criminally poor ‘pavement art’ on display outside today....Come on London we have so much talent surely we can do better."
238,Lots to see for art lovers,Just loved it all to be honest. It’s quite humbling to stand in front of such beautiful works of art. I love Vincent and I always get a certain buzz when I see his works. All these years and he is still so loved. Staff are very friendly and it’s a must if you are coming to London.
239,Renew acquaintance with Turner and Claude's pictures.,A real jewel! The most amazing selection and collection of art I have ever seen.  I am still amazed that it's free to enter.  Closing soon so hurry up!
240,A day at the National Gallery,An amazing opportunity to view some of the worlds best art. Van Gogh's Sunflowers being amongst them.
241,Fantastic,"Good quality and choice of different styles of food. But what was on show was not really what we received. Just a sandwich on a plate with no garish or salad.  Told that was extra. Also I had to wait so long to pick up my coffee, my food was cold by the time I returned to the table. For what we received it was very expensive."
242,Great for the 1st date,"We have been here with the whole family at least 5 times and it always feels so new. A wide variety of the most beautiful artwork from different ages and painters and countries, all housed in a gorgeous building. The interior of the gallery itself is one of the most impressive things about it. I would recommend coming on a weekday to avoid the crowds, but the Van Gogh pieces usually have a decent number of people surrounding them. If you come during the week you can take decent pictures. Entry is free but we made a donation upon entering."
243,Totally recommend it,My daughter and I spent a few hours here enjoying all the marvellous paintings. If you like art this is the place.
244,Must See for Any Art Lover,"One of the best museums of London. It takes a day to visit all the place, but it's worth it! Good for adults."
245,"Van Gogh ,Monet  and others",Great place. not too busy when we were there. Lots of groups doing different things. Very interesting. Nice way to spend a few hours.
246,Amazing Exhibits,Went in just for an hour when we had some time.  Donations as opposed to an entrance fee which was nice since we didn't have much time.  Audio tour is very helpful.  The building is lovely and worth the walk!
247,Greatest Collection ,"Pre-booking required due to restrictions on visitor numbers. This means there is plenty of opportunity to get up close to the beautiful artwork, even the famous paintings. No pressure to move on. All staff friendly and helpful."
248,Nice old building,"Visiting this museum for free is amazing. If you re Art lover, you could spent few days around and if not, just a quick look during a rainy day will be good."
249,A Treasure Trove of Displays,"Fall in love with Pissarro again and get up, close and personal with Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and others. Even if the teenagers moan, hopefully it sank in at some level."
250,sunflowers by Van Gogh,A masterpiece around every corner. Lose yourself in the galleries and ignore the crowds. It’s worth it!
251,lovely gallery,"Lovely exhibits and could've spent more time if I had an open schedule. If you like visiting museums on your trips, this one is worth it."
252,Wonderful Day Out :),"Yes, it was a horrible wet Saturday afternoon but I adore the National Gallery. Even for someone who doesn't really know his art, it's a wonderful experience just to wander through & marvel at the beautiful building & artwork and ponder history. Very enjoyable & highly recommended."
253,Leonardo da Vinci- Virgin of the rocks,This is one of my favourite places in London.  We are so very lucky to have such beautiful pieces all under one roof.
254,Wow,"We found the routes around the gallery a little confusing, not sure that we saw everything, but other than that, it was very good."
255,In the company of masters,Wonderful place with so much history. would highly recommend a visit. Taking some friends next month for another visit.
256,A fantastic display ,Such a beauty. A very nice place. Very well kept. I enjoyed my visit there. I can't say something about this place. It was a beauty.
257,Pick an off peak time to visit,Art isn't usually my thing but there's a great variety here including jewellry and theatre art which were both very impressive.
258,Amazing and it’s free,"This wonderful free museum houses such a special collection. Always enjoy visiting and finding new favourites, as well as going back to see old friends!Security and cloakroom staff were really friendly and helpful so they deserve a shout out! We visited twice this week when we had a bit of time to spare and really had a lovely time. Look forward to coming back soon!"
259,Fantastic ! ,Went in to escape the rain. What an amazing place to be able to enter free of charge. It really brings history and it's characters to life. Right up to date with a brilliantly executed portrait of Ed Shearan. Would go again to cover the areas we had no time for.
260,"Van Gough, Monet, Cezanne, Rousseau and alot more...for FREE!",Easy to visit and very helpful staff - wonderful shop!  So much to see and variety of artists and art work - and free!
261,Chock full of wonderful art but it is like a maze in there.,I was impressed truly everything was interesting and I did all the tour in my language (Spanish) loved everithing
262,Excellent,"Whether you are a total art lover or not, the National Gallery has to be worth an hour or two of your time. From 15th century paintings that still display the most dazzling colours to the Masterpieces we all know by Van Gogh, Turner & Constable. There is too much to see but as the National Gallery is a free to enter museum then you can see what you like and go back again later. Great to see workshops laid on for younger visitors too."
263,Immersed myself with Monet masterpiece,"An elegant museum housing a very nice collection of over 2,300 paintings. Approximately two-thirds of the pieces were donated by private collectors (likely in exchange for a tax receipt). Wonderful collection, and rated as one of the world's top ten."
264,nice place to go for a day out in london,"What a building, what a selection of paintings.  We should be eternally grateful for a place like this."
265,Great day out,I was here on last Sunday. It was a wonderful experience I saw many beautiful paintings. There was a huge variety of artists and the Gallery is huge. Spent a few hours here to try to appreciate and see everything I highly recommend going here
266,First museum to visit in London.,A must see of Britain's historical figures. highlights tour is well worth joining and then dine with a view.
267,You need Time,"Beautiful spot ! Always worth a visits, whether a tourist or a local Londoner, It never disappoints."
268,Priceless,"Just an amazing, huge variety of art. Many famous artists work is housed in this beautiful building. It is well worth the visit!"
269,A National Treasure,Visited with a friend to see Sunflowers by Vincent Van Gogh. The gallery was extremely busy as we went on a Saturday. It got less busy as the evening went on. Well worth a visit.
270,Great,This museum contains one of the largest art collections in the world next to the big museums all over the world. Its Europeanian collections and mainly the English are huge and fascinating. Its entrance is free so you can come again and again....
271,Leonardo exhibit,Really nice place to visit amazing place just love this place I'll give you a big thumbs up to National Gallery
272,First Visit,"Fabulous venue and well worth a visit, central location and fantastic staff. Always a pleasure to visit"
273,Loved,"OMG! free admission, are you serious? i am a skilled traveler but if you see something like that in europe – you should go for sure... it’s beautiful place – a lot of people though"
274,So much to see,Fantastic attraction. Something for everyone. Need to give yourself plenty of time to get around as much as you can
275,Great for a mooch in art environment,After having nice desert at the near by cafe we went there because it started to rain and we have not been disappointed. I felt in love with Monet art works.
276,Inflexibility,"A little bit of culture goes a long way, that's why many a good relationship as started from treading the galleries at the Nat....beautifully designed halls welcome and encourage you to explore its interior. Straight away from outside you are greeted by the smile of the Roman columns across the gallery facaded....but once inside the world of Art is there to show off it's very best from throughout the ages and across the globe. I for one believe it's a natural place for a 1st date, and set within one of the worlds most romantic cities."
277,A must see.,"One good thing to come out of the weird pandemic situation that we are all living in is that I have been looking for things to to do to replace things that I would normally do but can't.  I haven't been to the National Gallery in years but finding it is open on Friday nights to 9 pm - how great is that for us workers - I went for a couple of hours and I loved it.  It is a beautiful building, has the most amazing art that even people who don't know much about art might know a lot of and it was calm and relaxed and so nice.  I actually didn't have time to do all that I wanted so will be back to see the Artemisia exhibition in October - Renaissance girl power beating the odds so well worth a look! - and will do the amazing other stuff I didn't get to then"
278,Plan to spend the day,"One of the perks of staying at St. James is the proximity to everything touristy.  This was one of them.  We couldn't be happier on how we planned our trip.  For being 1st timers in this country/city, we did good.  We even brought Mr. Sunshine with us from sunny California (after raining everyday for a week) before we got in.  So much to discover and learn and this place is a good start."
279,Well Presented Leonardo da Vinci,Numbers are restricted and you have to book but you can still get in for free and it is fabulous to see the paintings without loads of bodies in front of you
280,Amazing National Gallery,"We got into our London lodgings and then took a bus after dinner to see some sights.  We got off right in front of the National Gallery -- and it was open!  I was revitalized by this art, many pieces I remembered from my ""History of Art"" class in college.  Well worth visiting. I used to go to the Smithsonian and Phillips Galleries a lot when I lived in DC. So I'm used to great art but this place is spectacular."
281,Lucian Freud exhibition,"So much to see inside, make sure you give yourself plenty of time to experience all the joy and magic."
282,Such a beauty ,"You don't appreciate what you have until you don't have it any more.  Well done therefore to the National Gallery to opening up in a sensitive way and allowing us to enjoy their great treasures again. Our visit started with the exhibition 'Titian: Love, Desire, Death' which opened earlier in the year and than almost immediately closed because of the lockdown. In 1551, Prince Philip of Spain (the future King Phillip II) commissioned Titian to produce a series of paintings showing classical myths mostly from Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'.All six paintings, which are now spread across the world, were reunited in the National Gallery just before lockdown and have been here waiting for visitors to return.  I bet Titian never thought that the people viewing his paintings would all be wearing facemasks.....From there you exit into a room which highlights the quality of the National Gallery's own collection of Titians, alongside other artists such as Michelangelo, Parmigianio and Sabastiono del Piombo.The Gallery now has three routes for visitors to follow. Ours took us through the newly-refurbished Gallery 32 with its dazzling colour and lighting scheme past many familiar friends.  It did however make the adjacent rooms look a little dowdy.  An enjoyable visit, ending with the shop where we bought a face mask with Van Gogh's Sunflowers - one of this year's fashion accessories.... masks are going to be with us for a while."
283,Leonardo exhibition on - also Gauguin,"Admission is free, but donations appreciated. Go in the morning. Have lunch in Chinatown spend another hour in the afternoon"
284,to do at least once in its life,Always great to come back with the wife and kids..........🥰Very helpful staff and convenient location.
285,Masterpieces not to be missed by art lovers.,to look in this is a treat marvel at glorious  paintings etc and go to its smart cafe if its open its dear but the place is free
286,great day out,"On a seriously wet and windy Sunday, there's no better place to go, although a lot of people had the same idea. It's a warren of rooms with  amazing art to lose yourself in from Rubens to Titian to Constable to Seurat. My favourite room, always crowded, is the one with all the impressionist art. The cafe has excellent service and wonderful food at a reasonable price. Too much to take it all in one visit but a place to return to many times. It's actually, a great place to visit, no matter the weather."
287,National Gallery,"Founded in 1824 - stunning collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th to 20th century with exquisite temporary Exhibits. The 500,000 sq ft  Museum is located on the historical Trafalgar Square."
288,A must see in London,Fantastic place would defantily go there again. When they re open it. There a lovely cafe too which is also nice
289,A Sunday with Leonardo da Vinci.,Had a great time studying and appreciates famous and talented work of arts by legendary and other amazing and talented painters. Looking at the art strokes can make oneself  going inside the picture and you in that place of the actual location of the paintings. Imagine that!
290, Nice,Lots of history and worth a visit.  Younger children might get a bit bored quickly but we enjoyed an hour or so strolling round
291,Came for the Gauguin Portraits,This is a nice old building building right off the square.  There was a holiday fest going on right in front of it.  It looked very imposing and strong in the evening.  I liked it.
292,Gaugin exhibition - brilliant! ,"Housing masters like Van Gogh, Rembrant, Monet, Manet and a dozen others whose names are mentioned in any art class, even those with a casual interest in art can pass half if not the full day seeing the whole musuem.A few of the rooms were closed for upgrades so i didnt get to see the full collection, i look foward to going back and seeing what i missed"
293,Fantastic art gallery ,"For both visitors and locals alike, if you are interested in art and have an afternoon in your itinerary, you couldn't wish for a more accessible, informative and downright breath-taking collection than that offered by the National Gallery........truly world class!"
294,Lots of pictures!,A beautiful museum with a large collection of painting from many periods. Also the temporary exhibitions can be very nice.
295,Gauguin,"Absolutely stunning, and you have handled the covid requirements very well. Thanks for a great visit!"
296,Gauguin Portraits.,A long time ago there was so many people I couldn't see a thing and I gave up. This time I managed to see the exhibits in several rooms without any problem. But you need 10 visits to see everything this wonderful museum has to offer.It is a pity that some of the most famous paintings weren't on display.
297,highlights tour and then dine with a view,"went there to looked around, there are lots of interesting things in side and lots people are chilling out side too"
298,Wonderful collection of European maters,"We had an hour to kill before our train home, so we dropped in here on our way to the station. Entry is free, though they do ask for donations. We went to the rooms that feature mostly 19th century artists, such as Turner, Monet, Cezanne and Van Gogh - some of our favourites. The gallery is laid out in a way that's very easy to navigate and find what you are looking for, and the rooms are presented in a very logical way. Take care to look up while you walk around as the building itself is beautiful and well worth a second look.Visit. You are certain to find something to please you."
299,London Art gallery ,"The art is phenomenal. Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, Vermeer, Maes, Van Dyke, Van Gogh... Stunning!The one way system is supposed to offer Routes A, B and C, but there’s actually just a load of white arrows on the floor with no clue which route they refer to. And apparently route B takes 35 minutes but route C takes 25 minutes, but you see ‘everything’ on route C but not route B? One man went the wrong way and got shouted at by a Gallery guard - I thought it was going to get violent! 😳Oh, and on the way in the bag search guy clearly couldn’t be arsed to search my rucksack - just waved me through without even looking at me. Amazing art, rubbish customer care.(Would still go again though. Because art. 🥰)"
