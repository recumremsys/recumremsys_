0,Stunning ar any time of the day and season.,Sitting in one corner of red square this silhouette is world famous. Its actually a collection of churches all built together all with their own story and all different sizes.  A feast for the eyes no visit to Moscow is complete without coming here.  
1,one of the most iconic images of Russia,It is an interesting piece of architecture. At the end one has a good view over the red square. worth the entrance fee.
2,What a night sight!,The bulding is really breathtaking and the whole red square is magnificent. In my view every single brick is telling a certain story about its past. It would be great to be there for a whole day and be there from sunrise to midnight although unfortunately I couldn't have done it for some pre scheduled apointments and plans.
3,Amazing Church,For me this was the jewel in the crown for Red Square.  The beautiful domes are all different in striking colouful shapes.  Inside there are nine tiny unique chapels and a high belfry.
4,The top most attraction of moscow,Beautiful Cathedral. The colours are just amazing. we didnt go inside but the architecture in history in this whole area are just amazing. Do not miss this
5,beautiful church building with attractive colors,The mosr beautiful cathedral i have ever seen. I was shocked that inside there are 10 churches. Unusual place
6,Iconic Cathedral in Moscow,"Interesting visit considering each onion like dome caps is separate chapel, most of them commemorating a victory in the war with the the Kazans.On the street level there is the tomb of St. Basil, then upstairs are the large array of small chapels under each domecap. It was quite interesting to see all the icons in each altarpiece and on the walls.A delight was being able to photograph each chapel as there weren’t many tourists. One of the many advantages of December travels."
7,"Must see inside as well as outside, do ground floor first.",Position at one end of Red Square is the very recognisable minarets of St Basils Cathedral. Seeing it in reality is even more stunning than its pictures
8,"Obviously a must see, if you don't go here, don't know what to say to you",Maginificent architectural work and landmark of the city. Could stay hours watching any of this colourful towers
9,Nice church,This is an amazing church at one end of Red Square which is as pretty as all the postcards depict it.... a joy!
10,To do,Iconic landmark right in the heart of Red Square. A beautiful cathedral from the 16th century with intriguing architecture. Worth a visit inside and a night time view of the colours displayed.
11,Nice church,It has a historical important in Red Square. Its  exterior architecture and building is stunning. I spent an hour in it but its content was not so interesting for me!
12,Simply Breathtaking,"It is one of the fmous church located in the Red square.Very nice with the nine towers and very colorful building, but remember that this not the most important church in the city."
13,Unique UNESCO site in the heart of Moscow,Well this is one of the most picture iconic landmark in Russia . It is a 16th century cathedral which is now a museum. The best place to appreciate and take the photo will be opposite the red square road heading to the zaryadye park. Beautiful and less congested spot for sure.
14,Breathtaking! Loved seeing this! ,"The cathedral was one of the most spectacular churches that can be seen in Moscow. Each tower consists of swirling colours, sculptured into seven towers. It is part of the red square and originally built by Ivan the terrible. We were part of a tour, which I believe enhances the experience as you learn about the history of each section."
15,holy. . .,"Situated in red square , this church is simply amazing from the outside.Very typical for Russia but the shapes and colours makes it stand out from the rest.The inside is a maze of narrow corridors and rooms , some with alters in.Highlight is the mens choir singing a few religious songs."
16,In the heart of Russia,"This “fairy castle” like structure has come to be an iconic symbol of Russia. This orthodox cathedral is among the most photographed buildings of Moscow and a day trip to the red square will get you here. Most tourists don’t enter this structure, but it may be worth a go to get a feel of the place and also to secure some awesome photo angles from inside the St. Basil’s."
17,St Basil’s Cathedral Red Square,"The Cathedral is as picturesque inside as it is outside. Great spot for the high end touristic memory. The only negative thing, they charge twice more for foreigners than locals or CIS citizens, namely 1000 rub and you have to show your documents."
18,Impressive ,"What to say, amazing building, great details, beautiful even for an atheist. Red Square as a whole is beautiful."
19,My favorite monument ,Words really cannot express about the stunning beauty of this iconic church. loved it and a must see on the Moscow Itinerary
20,Interesting history,A fairy tale building wonderfully situated in Red Square. The onion domes are vivid and the interior is spectacular. Listened to a small group singing a cappella which was musically beautiful and demonstrated the acoustic quality of the small interior churches
21,Visited only the outside of the building,Looks like a big birthday cake! Really interesting architecture and very photogenic from all angles. Very iconic image of Russia and a must for all itineraries
22,Exceeded my expectations,The church from the outside is amazing. Great architecture. Nice inside but not as nice as the churches within the Kremlin. We could have skipped going inside the church.
23,wonderful,"This building is an official symbol of Moscow. Of course you may make a photo close to this church, ""Wow, I've been on the Red Square. But it is very interesting inside. Not so many charches you can find decorate in XVI century original style. Enjoy it!"
24,Must see,Very beautiful colorful cathedral in Moscow.  Its a must visit place in Moscow. Its next to Red Square so you can visit both places.
25,A colorful accessible masterpiece,Must visit place. Any trip to Moscow is not complete without this Iconic structure. The most happening place with the adjoining GUM Shopping Mall. Try the Ice cream inside the Mall.
26,Family Holiday to Russia,Amazing scene in Moscow. Saint Basil's Cathedral is a must visit place in Moscow. It was located within the proximity of Red Square
27,A unique experience in an awe inspiring setting,Anybody visiting Moscow must see this icon church. Lots of paintings. We see this church in all Russian photos.
28,Orthodox church,"Only seen the cathedral on distanse, this time a visit inside. The building houses several different historic churches. A lot of beautiful pictures, loads of colors.A laberynth of rooms."
29,Iconic!,This cathedral is in the red square of Moscow. It is beautiful. It's history is interesting. We did not enter it but my tour- ate told me nothing interesting was inside.
30,Amazing place!,A great iconic and historical stop in Moscow with colorful Top towers an Incredible Architecture It’s a wonderful scenery October in Russia
31,Kind of want to eat it,You must visit the iconic symbol of Russia - Moscow and take take a picture outside of this most beautiful building St. Basil’s  and capture and the amazing details of this historical architecture in world.
32,Iconic St Basils,When you arrived in the Red Square and saw this Church is unforgettable!!!! Is 7 church’s in one!!!! Need see!!!!
33,Great from the outside,We didn't go in but walked around this and took so many pictures! It's right on red square adjacent to the Kremlin.
34,Lovely from outside and amazing inside,"Who knew before visiting that St Basil's is actually 10 churches next to each other within a single outer shell. Make sure you see all of them - my photographs of each in turn showed us we had seen 9 and were able to work out the one we still had to find. Most had a highly decorated screen in them, many but not all had decorated walls, and it pays to look straight up inside several of them too.Thought it was relatively expensive though at 1000 rubles.And, although we don't have children traveling with us, we noted that 'children under 16' were charged too, 150 rubles. Don't know at what age down to they enforce  thisWe were there around 9.40am, Tuesday, and there was no queue, and it was still only about 20 people by 10am opening time"
35,Unique building on the Red Square,Probably one of most Moscow icons known for everybody. Out side is just amazing and I recommend to expend few minutes around checking every detail.The inside is not that amazing to be honest cathedrals in the Kremlin are maybe better?
36,Amazing !,"Surprisingly small inside the cathedral is very beautiful.  Whilst we were there some singers started singing in a chapel, which was lovely to hear."
37,Amazing place,Everywhere we go in the Red Square we can see the St. Basil'sCathedral with its distinct colourful onion cone towers.
38,Intersting,"Red square area looks best at night with all the lights up in all the monuments and surrounding area.  Don't miss it.  It's very safe at night.  No worries.  Especially during Summer, the sky is still bright and clear at 8.30pm..."
39,In Red Square,Wonderful building. The cathedral is full of little rooms dedicated to lots of different Saints. Well worth paying to go in. The day we went it some men were singing the old choir songs that past generations would have heard...just wonderful.
40,Moscow Highlight,"Beautiful church building with attractive colors, nice for photography. Many shopping place and food stall around it and also some ancient building."
41,"Winter or Spring, Day or Night, A Must See","The building itself is one of the most famed and iconic buildings in the world. It is beautiful in any light or weather, although we found it most atmospheric in the evenings and mornings. The interior can be viewed for a modest fee. Parts of the interior are decorated elaborately, others are dark and gloomy while others are nearly entirely bare. Due to the layout of the building, there are no large interior spaces, as each dome caps a separate chapel. Some people find the interior underwhelming, but we really liked it, as each chapel had its own atmosphere and exploring the little passageways and rooms was like an adventure."
42,Incredible to tour inside,To me if someone says Moscow this building is what I picture and now having visited nothing has changed.  It is a beautiful building that despite being close to 500 years old looks immaculate (obviously some restoration work has taken place).   The area gets insanely busy with tourists and if you are planning to go into the cathedral plan ahead as the square has concerts and marches on quite regularly from what I can see and did indeed result in us missing out on going inside on our last days there.If you don't get a photo or visit here then have you really been to Moscow?
43,What a stunning monument!,Few building identify a city as much as St Basils. It truly is a besutiful building both outside and inside. We definitely would recommend visting this special place.
44,Great to see at any time ,"A beautiful and colorful building architecturally (apart from its historical significance) as viewed from Red Square, especially just before sunset and then again after night falls. However, it is closed after 7 p.m. (in summer) so you will probably have to make two visits or perhaps visit late in the day, then have dinner at a restaurant nearby then return for the night view of the building from the outside."
45,Day out in Moscow ,It is a must do in Moscow! One of the most recognized monument in the world. The Cathedral is fantastic both during night and day. What a beautiful city Moscow!
46,Iconic and beautiful beyond words,This cathedral is really amazing. This is for us the most stunning monument in Moscow. Its architecture is so different and beautiful. It's a must-see.
47,Amazing,very interesting especially as there are many buildings builted representing different periods as well as different architects (mainly coming from Italy!)
48,Simply stunning,"This cathedral built by Ivan the terrible is one of the iconic structures in Russia. Located at red square and next to the Kremlin, this cathedral with its stunning architecture and vivid colours is a sight to behold"
49,Impressive cathedral,Definitely a “must see” while in Moscow. A cathedral with a unique architecture and one that will stand in your mind forever.  It’s one of the most recognized structures in Moscow. I seen have seen hundreds of cathedrals in my travels but this one definitely stands out as one of the most unique. There are 9 different chapel type rooms inside to view. It used to be the tallest building in Moscow at one time. Located right in the red square.
50,Must see ,"The cathedral is very beautiful from the outside, we had also bought tickets to see it from the inside and like many other writes you might expect a large church room which is not there. It is still beautiful also inside and worth a visit."
51,It was Magic,One of the most recognisable churches in the world. It’s impressive architecture is a true architectural masterpiece. You can visit the cathedral (which is technically a museum) and photography is permitted inside.St. Basil's speaks for itself in all honesty
52,The MOST photographed sight,"The architecture and fine details of this most recognized symbol of Moscow and Russia is amazingly beautiful and unique. I have been through many Russian Orthodox churches; they are a testament of the faith of the good people of Russia. St. Basil's Cathedral is a leading example. A ""must see"" on a visit to Moscow."
53,Must See,"This was always the iconic symbol of Moscow for me and on my bucket list to visit.  It's beautiful on the inside, but even if you don't go in you have to walk around the exterior and just stare in awe at its beauty."
54,A must see,This is the landmark of Moscow and should be a must for every visitor. The colorful and picturesque cathedral in fact consists of a number of smaller churches which are beautiful and very interesting to see.
55,Great architect,"This Cathedral is a stunning building from the outside with the colourful cupolas and the grand design. However, the real beauty of the Cathedral is on the inside with an impressive array of small chapels each with a distinctive character. We were entertained by a baritone quintet in one of the chapels, and the acoustics were great. There are numerous steps to negotiate and these vary in height. Be mindful of your surroundings, and we noticed that there were pickpockets operating in the area. Thanks for your vote."
56,What a sight ,"Everyone associates both Moscow and Russia with this cathedral.  It looks great day or night from every angle.The interior is very interesting, but crowded, so it is pointless to try to take photos."
57,Wonderful ,"Historical place right in the edge of Red Square. Amazing art work and architecture. We didn’t go inside, just decided to walk around and make some pics. From that place you can easily find Zariadie park. Also beautiful place to see"
58,Beautiful Russian Architecture.,"This cathedral is the most famous in Moscow. However, I think it is more beautiful outside than inside. Quite expensive to get in, 1000 rubles, which makes it less crowded than other places. No lines at the ticket office when we were there. It’s hard not to get lost in the many chambers. A choir is singing inside, selling CD’s. A nice rest sitting down listening to it."
59,"Impressive but beware of quite steep staircase, some  over 60 cm high","Intetesting and beautiful church, an icon on the Red square. Nice paintings and interesting items to be seen."
60,Fairytale like,"Certainly one of the wonders of this world, nothing can be written enough to describe it. Located on the Red Square, it looks like flowers coming out of the floor"
61,a delight on red square,an orthodoc church in the center of the city.one of Russia landmark and icon.a good place to see history.
62,Moscow Landmark,It is so beautiful. Nice place. I think outside views is better than inside.So many people are visiting it.
63,This was one of our favourite places in Moscow.,"An iconic location in Moscow, you can't miss this place in the Red Square. It is a must for any respectable DP! Don't miss the yummy ice cream in the GUM shopping centre or the Media Centre in Zaryadaye Park nearby. A terrific 7D show runs there called ""Soaring over Moscow"". Worth the cost, this show is cheaper on week days."
64,Fairy Tale Land in Moscow,I liked it the most. Its colors and shapes in red sq will attracts any travelers to it. I think the most beautiful building to see is saint basil
65,A absolute must,Its absolutely beautiful but very crowded. It has a beautiful garden around it and better to book tickets online as the queue is shorted versus the on spot ticket queue is too long!
66,Breath taking tour,"St.Basil’s Cathedral - a famous 16th Century coloring temple dominated by the Red Square.  It is made of several independent bones, a pater and a hedge.  For as long as you are safe, hear the men's congregation sing in one go. Voices echo into other rooms.  In my opinion, one from the most interesting church in Russia."
67,red square in Moscow (the main square ),its a has to be done if in Moscow..beautiful cathedral steeped in history well worth the entry ticket to see all of inside
68,Stunning!,"Built so nicely, amazing look, inside is beautiful, nice to spend time in the area as there are lots of other things to see in the area, you never gonna be bored"
69,What can you say but fantastic!,"St Basil’s at night lit up is beautiful, always wanted to go to Red  Square and was not disappointed !!"
70,Russian Highlight,"Situated right in Red Square. Its beauty is beyond description... has to be seen with one's own eyes and photographs do not capture its beauty too well. I ended up going here several times for various reasons, as quite a few attractions are in the Red Square area and thus had the pleasure of seeing the Cathedral at various hours in the day. It is beautiful whether in the Day, evening or night."
71,Superb!,"This church by the Red Square and the Kremlin must be one of the most unusual ecclesiastical buildings anywhere in the world, an iconic and immediately recognisable landmark of Moscow and of all Russia.   There are 6 domes and 4 spires, quite close to each other, and all of different shape and colour. Inside one will not find a big hall, as expected in a church, but a maze of corridors and various small chapels, with steps up and down. Wall paintings are everywhere, also gilded iconostasis'.  To visit the Cathedral one has to first queue up before a counter and get a ticket for 700 RUB. Exit is from a different place than the entry. Unlike many other churches in Moscow photography is allowed inside, which has to do with the fact that since 1923 this building functions as a museum, although as of 1991 again divine services are held here on Sunday mornings.  The official name of the church is 'Cathedral of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos on the Moat'.  The intercession of the Mother of God (Theotokos) or Holy Virgin is a feast day especially in the Slavic Orthodox Churches, celebrated on October 14th. On this day in the year 1562 the then tsar Ivan the Terrible captured the city of Kazan and it is in memory of this event that he gave the orders for the construction of this church.  Today the church is better known under the name 'Saint Basil's Cathedral', referring not to the famous 4th century saint, Basil the Great, from Cappadocia, but to a local 16th century 'Fool of Christ' and soothsayer, known as St.Basil the Blessed, whose tomb is inside this cathedral. It is said that he used to walk around naked und thus he is depicted inside without clothes.…"
72,"Shut to visitors when we visited, but outside looks better than photos",so beautiful with alot of history and hand work in the designs. Tickets are cheap so worth viewing it out.
73,Right in the center of Red Square,One of the most beautiful places in Moscow to be visited while visiting Moscow city. Amazing building build in a beautiful style
74,History revisited ,"Symbolic place, absolutely charming and different. Better take pictures from the red square. We didn't go inside due to some construction job but admired it from all corners. It is centrally located in Moscow so you can easily walk to it if you are staying in the center."
75,Wonderful,"St Basil’s Cathedral was Created in the 16th century, this masterpiece is one of Russia’s most photographed sights. Its iconic mix of colours, patterns and shapes makes it spectacular. SEE photos."
76,Certainly one of the wonders of this world,This place is must see. You will remember it forever. Its fantastic! St.Basil's Cathedral is a fairytale!
77,Just beautiful,Beautiful palace with amazing color You can seat near this palace and see hours Like that sinbad cartoons Don't miss it at night
78,Fantastic sample of Russian and world history,"Almost Every picture about Moscow or Russia features St.Basil’s cathedral! It is definitely a symbol of the Red square and part of Kitay Gorod outside the Kremlin. This was originally built by Ivan the Terrible  (IV) and permanently beautified by Catherine the Great. After the Romanov period, during the Soviet regime, Stalin tried to demolish it but the high priest threatened to slit his own throat on the steps of the cathedral and saved the building ! When you step out from within the Kremlin one literally gasps at the beauty, the variegated colors in each onion dome! Such a beautiful array of hues! Similar to the Church of Spilled blood in St.Petersburg!"
79,You HAVE to go!,Of course you will walk around red square and right now there are dozens of small stalls filled with Russian art and trinkets. This magnificent building looms large in the background and is a delight to see. Ours was a grey and rainy day and this lite up the shy with color and whimsy.
80,Iconic,"Its's gorgeous from outside and inside. Always crowded, hard to take pictures. Very tourist place, must to see in Moscow. Good thing it;s next to Kremlin and don't have to drive, just walk there."
81,finally got to see it,"Moscow’s most famous work of architecture and is most recognizable Russian building. A must see for traveler inside and outside. Just magnificent, gorgeous and beautiful."
82,Beautiful cathedral during day and night,One of the remarkable buildings in Moscow.The design and architecture of the building is so beautiful and colourful.One of the iconic places that you will really like it in Moscow
83,Beautiful at night and during the day,"Just as you exit the Kremlin fortess onto Red square look right, the Cathedral is an iconic beauty, a must to see."
84,Going deep into Russian ancient times,"This is one of the most iconic attractions of Moscow and it truly stands out at any time of the day . Known to be one of the most photographed Cathedral in Moscow , this is a place which is a must visit for all tourists . The GUM mall is very close to the same and also the Kremlin . Even if you get a chance to see this during the day , you should also make a visit when its dark , as the feeling is very different"
85,The most iconic place in the world and must visit,"It is one of the landmarks of Moscow, south side of Red Square, beside Kremlin and in front of History Museum. It has many chambers, Icon paintings and a museum inside."
86,Short excursion for business colleagues,Beautiful outside and inside. This is a must see when in Moskou. In the evening the lights make it as if you are in Disney world.
87,Just like in the post cards,Interesting building that looks even better and more distinctive than it appears in photos. It was shut to visitors when we visited but an interesting building located on the edge of the famous Red Square. Worth a visit.
88,I finally had the chance to go inside of the landmark cathedral.,Perfect aesthetics and great architecture for the most important sight of Moscow!!     Highly recommended
89,Awesome view,"Pretty amazing place in an amazing situation. And absolute must, has been preserved and looked after so well. You can't go to Moscow and not visit."
90,Beautiful!,"Visited in July.  Beautiful cathedral, even in the rain... :-)See it from its different sides, as there are wonderful views from different angles."
91,Impressive,"Such an impressive building,not only outside but inside too. Take your time and wander into the little churches that you will discover inside the main building."
92,Beautyful,U can't see Moscow without come to this huge place with all the turist.Danger - lot of people who looks like Putin or Stalin or Lenin will try to take pic with u and then ask money.... Don't be stupid.
93,the best place in Moscow,"10 churches in one building, this is an amazing place inside and out.  We also rented the audio version which was helpful to understand the history and the various churches that surrounded the main church.We were there on a Saturday and an amazing men’s acapella ensemble named Doros sang inside one of these outer smaller churches. Their beautiful sound rang throughout."
94,Beautifully,"What an imposing building this is. Not as big as some western European cathedrals but the colour and the architecture on St Basil's certainly gives it the wow factor. Our escorted tour did not give us time to visit the inside, but I'm sure it is as grand as the outside.Not to be missed."
95,Interesting Cathedral ,So magical! Looks like a fairytale with such vibrant colours. However it’s more beautiful on the outside than the inside..
96,Beautiful structure.,The best icon in russia to go and see. Its in the red square. Entrance ticket us ruble 700/=. There are small corridors and partway in side the church. The wall decorations were amazing. I like the celling painting. Its a eye catching gold and bronze works inside. You can get photos but no flash and selfi sticks.
97,Mr,Just like the post cards St Bails Cathedral is amazing to see.  It is larger on the outside and looks fantastic against the blue Moscow sky. When we entered the first floor we were surprised to find lots of small rooms and halls.  Up a narrow staircase with large uneven stairs finds you on the 2nd floor with more rooms to explore. In the middle we came across four men who sang the most beautiful hymns of which you could buy their CDs.Great views also.
98,Surreal,"Dominating Red Square is St. Basil's church. Built by a Russian Czar it is remarkably unique with its multiple 'onion domes' and is beautifully painted. It is painted every 25 years or so and I was told the onion domes can change color, hence, older photos will show different colors than what now exist. It is one of the ultimate 'photo stops' while in Moscow. Try it."
99,Beautiful ,That’s definitely a must see when you are in Moscow ! Go at nighttimeIt’s beautiful with all the lights !
100,St Basils,You cant go to Moscow without visiting here. The square is huge and very lively. After dark lighting is very good.
101,very good,"Because there were celebrations going on in Red Square, it wasn’t totally accessible, but nevertheless it was a beautiful sight to see and we got some beautiful pictures."
102,Grandeur,Absolutely stunning with onion shaped domes and different colours and patterns. Got to see it at night and during the day  stunning at both times. Very crowded at all times. Did not go inside.
103,Beautiful part of Red Square,"The church is really cute, it's nice how it kept preserved over the years.The inside isn't the style of church we are used to see, as it has many small rooms and not an open area where we can join the mess. In my view it's an unique experience"
104,Not what you expect,The entrance fee is much more expensive than other churches and museums. It is a collection of small chapels inside so there are a lot of small rooms. It was very crowded when we visited so we didn't enjoy it much.
105,Incredible ,"Amazing Orthodox church with many chambers,  stairs,  beautiful ancient orthodox art, icons, located on the red square in the center of Moscow"
106,Iconic,Have always wanted to see St. Basil's and finally made it. To enter cost 700 doubles and well worth it. So many small churches within one we got a bit lost but came upon a male choir singing and it was just magic.Saw it at night too when it was even more beautiful. NOT TO BE MISSED
107,Nice ,"It's just amazing. Not to be missed. It's the typical landmark of Moscow and if you don't have a photo with this cathedral behind you, it's like you have never been to Moscow :)"
108,Stunning building,"This is a must see when visiting Moscow. Even worth suffering the inevitable crowds. The cultural heartbeat of Moscow, beautifult and evocative."
109,"This is Moscow, This is Russia","It is the hallmark or a symbol of russia, what a beautiful cathedral one of its kind the colouring  the overall construction with background of red square, an amazing and must visit place for any traveller"
110,Vitis Moscow ,The beautiful colourful domes of the grand St.Basil's Church was a sight to behold.  Straight out of a picture book.
111,Iconic!,"The cathedral is obviously a symbol of Moscow and it looks spectacular on the outside. You have to pay to get in (700) and it’s the same fee as the other places but I thought it wasn’t worth it, so didn’t pay. Looking at it from the outside is more than enough."
112,Amazing spot to visit,"It’s actually more than one cathedral, several cathedrals attachmed to each other. You need a guide to tell you about it and walk with you in town to discover the area"
113,Just Amazing,Impressive collection of several small Russian orthodox churches. Beautiful colorful cupolas. Find small stairs and balcony with wonderful view on the Red Square.
114,A Classic Stop in Moscow,This landmark is a must see for any visit to the Red Square/Kremlin area.  The outside is prettier than the inside.
115,Moscow's Gem,The setting inside is even more extraodinarily beautiful than the exterior. This is not one single church but a mosaic of individual chapels all uniquely decorated and linking one into the other. A dozen dramatic spaces steeped in orthodox imagery and richly textured walls connect together through narrow corridors like the intimate setting of a fantasy novel. This site must be experienced to be believed.
116,How could you ever get bored of seeing this cathedral,I visited the St Basil's Cathedral as part of a Moscow highlights tour.  It was on one end of the Red Square and a great picture Op. The history and details of the Cathedral are interesting and a bit odd. Cant miss part of the Moscow highlights tour
117,History,Just like the pictures from the outside and why you go to see it. The inside is quite different from any other church. Small chapels and a bit of a maze to get around them. I was underwhelmed by the inside perhaps I should just appreciate its difference.
118,St.Basil Cathedral - the landmark of the Red Ssquare,"Really amazing place, the art work, the lay out - all of it is amazing! Defo get an audio guide - it's not too long and interesting enough. To visit in late Sept was a great idea - not too many people around. Buy tickets online and collect them from the ""Online tickets only"" Desk - saves you a long wait (FYI you need cash for deposit on the audio guide - you get the money back - just deposit)"
119,splinter image of Russia,"apparently the most important place everyone should visit it in Moscow.one of the must-see place in Moscow.this square with nice stories and historical background is the symbol of whole country and the capital city . it has different parts such as colorful church in the southern part,a very huge and of course beautiful shopping center in the eastern part,gremlin palace in western part ,the main and the first avenue of the capital city in the northern part(tverskaya ulitsa)lennin tomb , Stalin tomb.and so many famous Russian political and well known persons tombyou can visit Russian history museum and 1812 museum as well.the central part of Moscow city is located exactly there.square is also amazing at night ,it is completely different with square you visited during the day."
120,The icon of russia ,St. Basil's Cathedral is the most famous building in Russia. The colors of the church are amazing.I booked online tickets to avoid the long queues! I enjoyed the details of the ways of the interior design.
121,Stunning Cathedral,"Always stunning from the outside especially in the sunlight, St. Basil's Cathedral has many beautiful churches and passageways inside."
122,Amazing to see! You have to do it!,"Thr Cathedral was commissioned by Ivan the Terrible and according to legend Ivan was so amazed at the beauty of this Cathedral that he had the architect blinded so that he would never be able to design something better.Go to the west side, if you want to see/capture symmetrical shape of the Cathedral."
123,You cannot go to Moscow without seeing this!,The symbol of Moscow so is mandatory to be visited at least from outside. Is placed on the red Square the main tourist attraction in Moskow and close to the Tourist-Bus station.
124,A picture postcard,"On a previous trip to Moscow ha only seen the outside of the Cathedral and wonderful as this is, had a chance this time to see the inside, courtesy of our wonderful guide. Hubby and i made our own way after intro by our guide. Luckily not too many people there as areas are small. Just stunningly beautiful. Gem after gem came to light as we made our way through. Totally memorable!"
125,Beautiful St. Basils Cathedral,"Maybe the most well-known symbol of Moscow. We went inside the church, but I think that it's a little disappointing as compared to the outside of the church."
126,An incredible sight,You can t miss it. Amazing from inside as well as outside. You can feel the history and same time being blessed when you take the inside tour. Icons are amazing. Never saw something like this
127,A true work of art,"The iconic symbol of Moscow, if not all of Russia sometimes, St. Basil’s Cathedral lives up to its reputation. We found it extremely beautiful and attractive both visits which were three years apart, never boring to go back to or pass by. We saw the men’s choir singing once and also a small music ensemble perform once, orthodox songs, hymns. The St. Basil’s Cathedral sits very relaxed, serene and charming on busy Red Square."
128,Iconic visit,Even from afar the conspicuous domes of St Basil's cathedral shine like a beacon. The colorful facade is a symbolic link to the glorious past of Russia. 
129,"Saint Basil's has remained an unchanged icon from the seventies as Red Square has ""evolved"" around it.","How could you not both view this amazing building but also not visit inside?  We visited in both daylight and the evening and preferred the evening although we toured inside during the day.  It is essentially lots of small and linked chapels with incredible designs, colours and acoustics."
130,Must Visit Place,"The colorful and historic cathedral is worth the visit inside. The outside is beautiful, but to walk by is to miss a lot. One note, the inside stair steps are uneven."
131,better than picture,"We were unable to visit the interior due to a concert in Red Square. But the exterior was so beautiful and colorful, we saw it both at night and during the day. A must place to visit."
132,Exquisite Cathedral in the heart of Red Square,"It is a true ancient Russian place, not just religious, but most in terms of culture and the way of life, customs and traditions, pre Peter the Great epoch. Peter is know for turning the Russian life, making it ""European"", by doing that just removing the ancient way of life. St Basil is a rare example of pre-Peter's life in Russia. It gives you a real feeling of how it used to be in the ancient times. It's been recently renovated carefully according to the original design. It's a real pearl of Moscow historic scene."
133,Icon of Moscow,"It's the most beautiful architecture of a cathedral! The onion domes are stunning in their beauty and amazing details. Very different compared to the churches that I have seen in Europe. The ticket counter is on the grounds. 1000 rubles per person. However I was a bit disappointed going inside. It is very narrow and you have to go up a very narrow and steep staircase which was very claustrophobic. As I was having problems, the security officer was kind enough  to usher me in thru the exit staircase which is a broad staircase. There are beautiful art work and decorations inside but nothing compared to the external beauty of the onion domes.There are several souvenir shops inside the cathedral as well as one on the grounds."
134,Absolutely magical - you will fall in love!,"This is a place to visit during day, but also during sunset, sunrise and at very night. It's wonderful. Outside looks much better than the inside. 700 rubl to enter."
135,Impressive,The way that all the artifacts and historical references are preserved is amazing. There is also video recreation of the history which makes it easier to understand how things happened.
136,Not just the outside but finally the inside!!!,"Although we did not visit inside St Basil's Cathedral, it is a very impressive building, beautfully designed."
137,Very crowded,The beautiful colors of the cathedral are in all of the pictures of Moscow.  The real thing is even more vivid.  The restorations inside the cathedral are amazing.  Truly remarkable that so much was saved and hidden during the communist era and then brought back to life.
138,Dream come true,Built by Ivan the terrible and although very interesting on the inside I actually found the exterior more impressive. Only 700 rubles to enter but quite narrow inside so I would go when it's quiet. Not pram/wheelchair friendly.
139,Bucket list ✔️,A must see and do when in Moscow. An amazing looking church and a famous Russian monument to visit and explore.
140,What a beautiful sight!,"How can you nót love this piece of architecture? Even though we visited during December which is a ridiculously cold time, it was still worth every minute of near-frostbite. This is a stunning cathedral, although it can get very crowded with tourists waiting in line to purchase tickets to enter - it is still worth it! The entire Red Square really does get very crowded with tourists and photographers but during Christmas the entire place is marvelously decorated, fabulously festive and ensures a memorable time. No regrets! I fell in love here!"
141,beautifull,"Absolutely stunning. Interesting to note St Basil’s is actually 8 smaller churches. Suggest a guided tour to explain the different churches. Beautiful and old and so much history. In the off season, you can grab great photos of St Basil’s as backdrop before 10am, with minimal people in background - after that crowds will get pretty big. My favourite monument in all of Russia."
142,Iconic!,St Basils cathedral is  beautiful.  We spent over 2 hours here wandering thru and marvelling at all the paintings and icons.  A very special place and fortunately not inunadated with en masse tour groups as were other parts of Moscow - eg Kremlin
143,Always a great attraction,"On the Red Square with the Kremlin, Lenin’s tomb and GUM so plan to spend a day at the Red Square as GUM is huge - bring your camera!"
144,The quintessential selfie location!,"As a tourist in Russia this is one of the things you are here to see. The architecture and grandeur is undeniably unique and beautiful, which we felt was best seen at night time! (Bonus that Red Square is a lot quieter then too) The tour we did inside (pre hired guide) was interesting and performance from the band inside was an icing on the cake!"
145,Very beautiful historical museum,"Good place to visit with lot of vibrancy in and around the place. Travelled in June, could see from outside only."
146,Beautiful,"One of the most amazing pieces of Russian Revival architecture, truely unique and amazing! unfortunately i haven't got the opprtunity to see it from inside"
147,Must see,"Basicly the reason we went to Moscow! The exterior looks unreal! It looks as magical as the photos, really beautiful. Too bad this area is too crowded and super touristy which makes it really hard to take a nice picture or enjoy the view as much as I hoped.The interior of the church is beautiful but underwhelming compared to the exterior."
148,famous and impressive,St Basils cathedral is a wonderful place to visit by day  in red square. But seeing it at night is just beautiful. Would recommend doing a night tour if in Moscow. They out do themselves with lights on  buildings and the river
149,Of course....,This is the iconic picture that comes to mind when you think of Moscow and it was just as I imagined. Stunning architecture and a piece of history. Very very crowded when we visited.
150,Postcard Perfect,"The color of the cathedral just incredible, even the weather was wet but I couldn't take off my eyes of this building and thinking about the story behind."
151,Amazing!,Any pic of moscow you see starts with this place so you cant miss it. Its the center of the city and surrounded by other important places in red square. There is museum inside. Its worth a watch.
152,must see,St Basils is one of those buildings that are always featured in guide books. When we were there the view was a little spoiled by the cranes associated with the music festival in Red Square
153,"Beautiful outside, a bit disappointing inside","I visited Saint Basils Cathedral in November 2018 in first photo's when cold with jacket and Again in August 2019 thus year ,later photo's with only t-shirt.I enjoy the cathedral, it is amazing architecture and a must see in a life time ,with Red Square and Moscow. I spend 14 nights in August 2019 in Moscow.  I visited the St Basil Cathedral twice."
154,Must read this!!!!,A visit to Moscow is not complete without seeing and picturing St. Basil Cathedral.  So iconic. So beautiful
155,Beautiful,Beautiful by day and at night.  We didn't go in as our tour guide told us that it's pretty well empty and not worth the cost of admission. My trip would not have been complete without going to see it!
156,A building looking like a colorful cake.,"Nice to visit. It's really attractive, more than it looks in the picture. It's an architectural art and a wonder in the Era it created."
157,Magnificent!,"A fun visit, even for kids, it you keep it short. Great views of Red Square from the upper floor. A little crowded mid day, but the ticket line was fast and worth the visit."
158,Best photo in Red Square,a truly breathtaking site either by day or by night 1 of the most stunning monuments on earth has to be seen to be believed
159,Stunning,A very good work has been done to restore the Church; the exhibition indoors is really interesting and showing the long tradition of icons in Russia.A very good place to make pictures with a beautiful view on the Red square and Kremlin.
160,History and mystery in an iconic setting ,"Of course, this is the main reason everyone goes to Red Square.  But there are shops and restaurants nearby as well, and people watching is fun.  Be careful of pick-pockets..."
161,Great a ,The colors are vibrant and the patterns on the “onions” are very interesting. We visited during the day and after dark. I think it’s more spectacular at night. A touristic memory that can’t be missed.
162,Photos do not do it Justice,"Such a well known site, outside the Kremlin is a must see! It was very cold the day we visited and although we feared cues, it was well organized"
163,Iconic Landmark,"The building is great on the outside and is also very interesting on the inside. By going through, you will learn a lot of interesting facts about not only about the Cathedral, but also about the City of Moscow."
164,St Basil,Such a beautiful cathedral from the inside and out. In a perfect side of town. The detail is incredible. A must see when in town.
165,Beautiful,"It is very nice to see all those icons and priceless parts of Russian orthodox history. The ticket price is around 700 rubles for adults and 150 rubles for students with ISIC cards. We had a chance to listen to a male choir while we were inside, and it is a magnificent experience."
166,Simply...beautiful,"The most beautiful church in the Russian capital in the historic Red Square, close to the Kremlin etc. Worth visiting and taking pictures."
167,Amazing chapels,Extraordinary building that is even more intriguing in real life and not to be missed. In remarkable condition.
168,Sasha from Sydney Australia ,"When you visit Moscow you know you have to visit Red Square and take a picture outside of St. Basil’s, but it really is worth visiting the inside as well and experiencing the amazing details and small “churches” that this historic building has to offer.  We visited as part of a guided tour, but just touring on your own will get you a good feel for the history and majesty of it.  When we visited there was also a small singing group inside the church that was beautiful to hear."
169,Beaitiful,St. Basil's Cathedral is a beautiful church that is definitely a must see when in Moscow. I highly recommend it.
170,Picturesque and interesting,"shocking to think stalin thought of demoloshing this cathedral to assist the flow of tanks through red square on soviet holidays still amazingly well preserved inside with the tomb of st basil, only draw back lots of step stairs but worth the climb"
171,A must any time,"St. Basil’s Cathedral is an iconic symbol of Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church. There are many magnificent Orthodox churches in Russia. This is one of them. There are at least two extremely beautiful ones in St. Petersburg, Russia. The exterior colours on St. Basil’s magnifies it’s beauty."
172,Beautiful but refused to pay,"I visited St Basil's in Moscow recently as I had long wanted to see and explore this most iconic building in the city. It was much older than I expected and deeply steeped in history. Ancient and priceless icons are on display in a series of small churches all contained under one roof. I have never seen anything like this and it was a fascinating experience. This is not a place which would appeal to everyone, however. Unlike the glorious churches in St Petersburg, St Basil's has the mysterious and rather eerie feeling of a manmade cave. Many people would find it claustrophobic, and the distinctly oriental quality of the painted motifs on the walls also take the Western traveller from his or her comfort zone. For many older people, the very steep steps up to the second floor would also be daunting.For a visitor looking for a different mystic experience or a history lover keen to peer back through the mists of time at a Moscow of a long byegone era, St Basil's is a must-see. For everyone else, I would suggest you rather take advantage of the magnificent photographic opportunities afforded by the building's whimsical and colourful exterior."
173,Small and expensive entry fee,"This is one of the most beautiful cathedrals I've ever seen! So colorful and vibrant, bigger than I expected. We woke up early to see it in the sunrise, at 7am there was only 3 or 4 other people, it was perfect! I definitely recommend going as early as possible to avoid the crowds and get the best pictures."
174,"Beautiful, iconic symbol of Moscow and Russia.",This is such an iconic building in Moscow and it took my breath away to see it close up - it is stunning.
175,Great visuals inside and out. ,"St. Basil's is beautiful - almost doesn't look real!  Red Square was pristine, not a speck of trash anywhere and no trash cans (?).  When we were there in the summer, they had most of Red Square itself blocked off to discourage people gathering to protest, but it was one of those places you just have to stand in to believe.  GUM department store and the mall are worth going in (you'll have to get past armed guards and a security scanner), just for the spectacle of high end stores.  The flowers are amazing and the landscaping was beautiful!"
176,Disney castle in Moskou,"I did not enter the cathedral as it was pretty expensive for me after spending so much on other tourist attractions of Russia, and I thought the interior is not much different with other churches I've seen. But it's beautiful to see it like a monument in red square."
177,Inside for those with religious belief,It’s a beautiful church. I thought it would be bigger than what it actually is. I didn’t go inside but you can stop for photos outside at any time. It wasn’t crowded when I went in February
178,Worth visiting,"Everytime I come to Moscow, I have to do the Saint Basil's cathedral. The entire are is so lively and pretty and fun!"
179,Moscow’s Most Famous Cathedral ,"Like a fairy tale come true. The Red Square is one of the most impressive places in the world, and the Cathedral is in iit! You have to live it!"
180,Stunning,"We did not take enough time to visit all the treasures of Moscow, this visit is absolutely to do, magnificent and splendid church, everything is well organized and we had taken an English speaking guide and it was practical"
181,Beautful,"The exterior of the Cathedral makes for a really great photo background though challenging to capture in its entirety and of course the numerous visitors. Inside, there are a few interesting exhibits and history. Do note that it is actually small inside. There is usually a group…"
182,Interesting insude too,"I am always curious about the interior of this cathedral.   The first time I went to Russia with a big tour group.   There was no way for us to go inside of the cathedral.   We were pleasantly surprised this time the line was not long.   We finally made it.   The interior of the cathedral is intriguing as much as the exterior,  the famous landmark of Moscow."
183,Definitely a must visit,"The cathedral is just amazing from the outside. The style and colors is like nothing I have seen anywhere else in the world. I could have spent hours looking at it from different angles. Make the time to go inside, there are many icons including those featuring st basil himself. The cathedral has two levels and many rooms. Try to get here early after opening or just before to avoid long lines as you must purchase a ticket first then line up to get in."
184,Amazing Architecture,"Stunning. Absolutely stunning. I had looked at pictures online but they just do not capture the true atmosphere of this church. I think I walked around with my mouth open the entire time. There was also a men’s choral group there singing period song which took the experience to a whole ‘nother level. Despite being the height of tourist season, the church was surprisingly not too busy. It probably helped that we had bought our tickets online ahead of time- don’t forget to exchange them for real tickets first! If you’re in Moscow, you have to visit St. Basil’s. Honestly, words cannot do it justice, but it is not an experience you want to miss!"
185,"Bring your kids to Church, History & Culture ","The outside is iconic, like Disney's (stolen from Germany's castle Schwanstein) castle at start of the cartoons. Inside is hardly spectaculair, so just enjoy the outside since if you are going to do more trips in Russia other cathedrals will make much more impression."
186,One of the most beautiful experience of my life,"I was looking forward to visiting this cathedral. Having taken so many pictures during my visits to the Red Square with St Basil in the background and Kremlin grounds and the beautiful Assumption cathedral, we did not see the need to visit another. We were satisfied admiring it from afar. Such a lovely lovely cathedral at the outside!"
187,Incredible Site,"From the outside, so unique, so beautiful, the colours bright and bold.  Recently restored, some restoration still going on. Right next to Moscow's Kremlin. Best photos when facing the Cathedral just to right, to avoid the big tree. You know you are in Moscow when your eyes hit this, and it is just the beginning."
188,Moscow by night,"Amazing to visit saint Basil ... if you are looking for a christian church, forget it , just small spaces, nothing big, very stange..but fantastic, crazy and I loved the inside and the outside !!!!!!!!"
189,more beautiful than I imagined.,Simple beautiful (and different) from all angles. Like out of a fairytale. Must visit when in Russia!
190,Beautiful.....must visit in Moscow,We spent a wonderful morning exploring this beautiful cathedral. It’s as stunning inside as it is outside. A must see when you visit Red Square.
191,Best to look from far away,"Very well maintained and beautiful cathedral in Red Square, Moscow. Definitely worth the few Rubles it costs to visit"
192,Best view at night,This iconic building is more than worth the trip to Moscow. It is very well maintained inside and out. Don't forget your camera!
193,Worth visiting,Visited only the outside of the building due to lack of opportunity and I have to say I was really please with how it looked. Amazing details even if it was a bit under construction.
194,It is so beautiful. ,"what an experience. You cannot come to Moscow without going there. Close to red square, magiv place."
195,Landmark of Russia,I have been to St Basil's more than once as it is very beautiful & interesting. A must see if you're visiting Moscow.
196,Beautifully coloured cathedral,"Superb to visit, colours ambience just wonderful.  So clean, so much history not one to miss. Managed to get a beautiful watercolour by a local artist of this magnificent building."
197,"Amazing array of colors, a symbol of Russia! ",The detailing of this iconic structure is simply amazing! The colourful onion shaped domes add a lot of mystique & fills you with awe..
198,An iconic church,It's an icon of Russioa and a must visit monument. Tickets online are nice option because avoid lines. Inside it's a surprise.
199,Beautiful and Iconic Church ,"The external view of the construction is spectacular, especially the night view. But be careful of pick pockets and the ‘photographers’ who force you to pay after u have taken picture with him/her.The interior view is worthy seeing too though the queue is always quite long."
200,Stunning ginger bread cathedral ,"Amazing,  like a sweet candy in color, beautiful and sharp in both day and night, must visit in Moscow"
201,A Must go church in Red Square,When you see the cathedral from the Red Square it's a really emotional moment. If you go to Moscow you have to go.
202,Beautiful,"Before our visit I have been there more then 20 years ago when I was a kid. I was impressed! It doesn’t take more then an hour, but it’s truly worth it!"
203,As beautiful as I expected,"no one should miss it, fabulous collorfull, great meaning, full of history, excellent photos to take and keep"
204,Unceremoniously chased out,"Beautiful and historic cathedral, if you are in Moscow then its a must visit.Beautiful and historic cathedral if you are in Moscow then it is a must to visit. We were here with the whole family and it was quite easy to get tickets, audioguide was available to rent so it was perfect."
205,Amazing Building from outside & inside!,Seen it in the movies and newsreels it did not disappoint in real life. Stunning building and accompanying surrounds.
206,Beautiful as it should be,"i do not know how to say about St.Basil's Cathedral. It is almost the best beautiful place, where you should come when visiting Moscow."
207,Beautiful St. Basil's,"We visited St Basils twice during our stay, day and night. Night just looks amazing but it was a really surreal experience to actually be there and not just seeing it on tv."
208,The colors and the pattern make it stand out !!!,"A lovely sunny spring day and the Cathedral looked spectacular we enjoyed the Red Square experience and were amazed at how clean it was, no litter or graffiti"
209,My visit to St Basil!,"I can now say that I have been to Moscow and this is proof. There is no getting around the magnificent site when you see this building. We first saw it at night and even though it wasn't lit up, I went down to take pictures of a little bear I photograph everywhere I go with it but when I was close, the lights suddenly came on and it was gorgeous. My husband, who was taking photos on the other side of the square, rushed over, and we snapped a few photos since our time with our tour was up and they were rushing us back since it was starting to rain. We would see the square during the daylight, but not again at night so this special moment was even more amazing that we had imagined."
210,This is the icon of Moscow. ,"St. Basil's Cathedral is not a cathedral in the normal sense but several churches within a church. Each one occupied a separate dome with a slightly larger one is the center. Each one was was different and were often stunning. When I was there, a male quintet was singing in the central church and was magic. Sometimes getting around the cathedral was confusing but eventually you get to see everything. It was a wonderful experience seeing this beautiful place."
211,Beautiful and impressive,Awesome experience. People are so friendly and welcoming. I would like to take my family one day. Infrastructure outdated but technologically advance.
212,Beautiful,We visited st basils cathedral in July 2019. It is absolutely stunning to look at during both the day and the night. The entrance fee however is quite expensive with not much to see on the inside. The ventilation is quite poor with there also being narrow passages and large crowds of people.
213,Do not miss it,They have a Quartet singing church music inside and it is magical.  Try to find a time of day when it is not crowded....
214,Stunning,"An absolute jewel, beatiful..We were very fortunate to have seen this magnificant Cathedral. Certainly one of Moscow's finest structures.Looking forward to our return!"
215,Beautiful icon,This quintessential Russian icon must be included in any visit to Russia. The beauty of this Cathedral will make you stop in your tracks.
216,Amazing church! ,We visited it during the day and then the next day in the evening. It is as seen in the pictures.No visit to moscow is complete without visiting St. Basil's Cathedral. It's so joyfully colorful that you would want to take zillions of pictures in front of it.
217,Stunning - an absolute must see in Moscow,There is a tour of the inside available.  Beautiful spot for photography or just to relax and people watch.
218,Saint Basil's Cathedral,"Our first evening in Moscow led us from our hotel to Red Square.  Walking through the gates on a road of cobblestones on a crisp December evening, you look up and see the cathedral bathed in light.  Okay, many including myself have seen it on television.  It gets no justice from television.  To stop and stare in wonder at this place is a moment in my life I'll never forget.  It is stunningly beautiful.  Anyone's first visit here should be at night.  Certainly a must visit on anyone's visit to Moscow.…"
219,Beautiful,"This is an iconic place that you can and need to see at any time. We were not able to get inside in the evening, but pictures were great."
220,Incredible,"I think this is the most bonkers looking cathedral in the world!  And I love it!  I always have to go and look at it, every time I'm in Moscow."
221,Beautiful All the Time,"A bit disappointing in comparison to its exterior, when seeing the grandeur of this Cathedral from the outside one would expect the same on the inside, although it is amazing but I expected more."
222,Absolutely awesome!,"For years I’ve dreamed of seeing this for myself and I was not disappointed ! Quick trip to ticket kiosk and then inside - it isn’t huge but it is bijou ! Even if you don’t like Churches (I do) you must surely appreciate the architecture , the art work , the beauty of this gem ! Well worth taking the the opportunity to see inside."
223,Superb,"St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow, located in Red Square, is definitely a must-go visit in the Russian capital. It has been one of the main symbols of Moscow for a long timeIt is a staple of the 16th century Russian architecture. With its one-of-a-kind ornaments and its bright colours it makes an unforgettable impression. The construction of the St. Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow was ordered by the Tsar Ivan the Terrible, and was conducted between 1555 and 1561, to celebrate the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan.The original building, known as Trinity Church and later Trinity Cathedral, contained eight churches arranged around a ninth, central church of Intercession; a tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local saint Vasily (Basil). inside, you can visit its nine chapels were all the rooms form a labyrinth. It is advised to take a audio tour for more information."
224,See it at night,"St Basil's church was built in 1552, by Ivan the Terrible, but otherwise it's quite a lovely place. The outside is world class architecture, but also the interior is very interesting, with 9 or 10 small chapels, each with their own style, history, and atmosphere. I don't recall seeing a church like this. When we visited a male choir sang beautiful! The visit cost 700 rubles per person, but it was worth it!!Please go!"
225,Landmark in Moscow,"It was incredible to see in person and it’s in an area with so many things to see. Even if you just have a connection in Moscow to get to somewhere else, you can’t miss out on it"
226,Iconic cathedral,Probably the most important note to visit Saint Basil’s cathedral is that it closes at 4 PM.  You also never have to worry about finding a great place to take a picture.
227,Stunning,I'm not a big fan of churches but Saint Basil's Cathedral was a cruch at first sight! I loved and would really enjoy going back to see it again.
228,A wonder!,More beautiful in real life than in pictures. Definitely a must-see if you're in the Red Square in Moscow.
229,Historical Architecture ,Just amazing.  It seems surreal.  Definitely go and see it if you enjoy colorful buildings and unusual architecture.  I could look at it for hours.
230,Very Colorful,"Wet day so no queue! I had no homework done on this so was really surprised by the interior. It is a labyrinth of small churches, beautifully painted. Minimalism not in the lexicon here! Well worth a visit. Beware of the internal steps, they are very deep."
231,Unique ,Well maintained and a star attraction in Moscow worth a picture or two there. Nicely illuminated in the evening too.
232,Moscow's most Iconic cathedral,You cannot go to Moscow and not visit St Basils Cathedral or at least stand in awe to see this amazing church in real colour :)
233,so beautiful....,Red square is awesome. The place is better in person than in the pictures. Though we didn't inside ( dont know if you get in) but outside is really magnificent.
234,Great Place to go,We were impressed by the cathedral but we couldn't fully appreciate it because of construction work. Disappointed that we could'nt get closer and inside.
235,colourful,"A funny monument to the conquest of peoples who are citizens of the Russian Federation today. they were brought in by force, but they forgot it. It's like a bride who was raped and forced to marry her husband.what you did to the architect of the building, you don't want to know"
236,Beautiful inside amd out ,I love coming to the Red Square after work. The cathedral looks good in any weather in any season...
237,Iconic,Not as big as many other churches but the entry fee is more than double. I bet its location helps. A lot of people . Good luck find a spot to take pictures!
238,Worth the few rubles to visit,"It is worth it to try to get inside, not at all what you expect, all these small rooms and like a labyrinth inside.  Really does look like the photos."
239,An iconic symbol of Moscow,This is not a cathedral like any other. If you are in Moscow you should pay a visit. Unusual and great history.
240,Spectacular st basils,No trip to Moscow is complete without a visit to this iconic Church.  Go inside...don't just take a picture from the outside!This maze of rooms is actually a collection of several chapels.  Make sure you climb the secret staircase to the central chapel and spend a moment there...every 15-20mins a Russian Male Choir does a short recital.  It is very moving to hear such wonderful voices in such a beautiful historic place
241,Very expensive and crowded,For the price tag attached to enter. This is not worth it. Very commercialized even a curio  shop inside. The beauty is more outside. Also the Russian orthodox churches are more elaborate and beautiful
242,Best scenery ever,"Interesting and historical place in center of  Moscow, inside possible to see many antic and saint things, recommend to visit 100%"
243,Just like the postcard,"Must see. Beautiful and iconic.  The default ticket seems to include access to a number of other venues and cost us 2000 roubles. I think you can buy one for St Basil interior for 500 roubles,"
244,Postcard perfect,I was so humbled to experience this Really would recommend the visit We visited more than once but didn’t pay to go inside The square is very busy so go early morning
245,Breathtaking,"The pictures and photographs you look at do not do this building justice in any way shape or form, it is stunning from all aspects. A must visit when you are in Moscow. The Cathedral is now a museum and an entrance fee of approx £5 is charged."
246,Iconic,Been there two times. Good place to immerse yourself in the great history of Russia. Discount for students.
247,Magnificent inside and out,"Many tourists think that St Basil's Cathedral is the Kremlin. That's because St Basil's has become the symbol of Russia.The Kremlin is the complex surrounding this area. You can take a private tour of the Kremlin during the day, which I highly recommend. We have been here twice, during Christmas, and in the Spring.We were just there for Christmas, and the decorations and lights around Red Square are incredible. I suggest seeing the Cathedral all lit up at night. If you want photos without tourists in them, this is the time to do it!During the day it is also beautiful, but insanely crowded.We took a private tour of the Kremlin in the Spring. Our guide was terrific, and we had access to all of the cathedrals, grounds, and museums. I highly recommend.You can walk around at night, but things close, so you can see it from the outside, but daytime is when cathedrals are open, and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier ceremony happens.No matter what time of year, you can just walk around Red Square. There are fountains, and statues that you can take in. See the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. I believe every hour they do the changing of the guards. It's something to experience.We enjoyed our 1st stay more, because our hotel was within 15 min walking distance to Red Square the St Basil's Cathedral, and w could stop by here each day, more easily."
248,a must!!!!,The only way to view St Basils is from the lower end of Red Square and at night - we were lucky to have a clear dry night with light clouds so the pictures are stunning - a truly beautiful building not to be missed.
249,Beautiful cathedral inside and out,The most important cathedral in Moscow. If you do not speak Russian and do not have guide tour a do recommend to buy audio-guide otherwise you will have some difficulty to understand the cathedral history.
250,St Basil disappointment,Such an iconic image.  It was everything I expected.  We only walked around the outside.   This was part of our Kremlin tour.
251,The famous cathedral,"Almost impossible to describe how breathtaking this Cathedral is when you first set eyes on it. The colours and designs of the Domes, all so perfectly formed.  The setting is magnificent and unforgettable, as is so much of this awesome City"
252,Historic place with lots of things to see,"Talk about St Basil, you definitely won't miss it when you are in Moscow! The colourful tops that surrounds the cathedral is definitely Instagram worthy! You may purchase additional entrance ticket to tour the interior of the cathedral but be prepared to be crowded inside. There are lots of tour groups and tourists all over the red square. Get yourself a good spot and start clicking away your camera/ phones for the beauty of the cathedral!!"
253,Jewel in the crown,"A delight was being able to photograph each chapel as there weren’t many tourists. One of the many advantages of December travels.Colours are vivid, camera does not have capability to capture them yet they will stay in your memory! Could be drafty, dress up appropriately"
254,Iconic symbol of Russia ,"I love historic places, and just to go and see this place with centuries on it, it was just incredible! It's a must when you go to Moscow"
255,St.basil,"You straightaway get the wow factor as soon as you see it, exactly as see on Tv or photos, well from outside the inside however is lovely don’t take me wrong, but don’t expect the big empty space like the classic orthodox coloured walls, is jut corridors and small rooms or chapels but still interesting objects"
256,Wole building is simply amazing,"Because of the long lines, we decided on the Cathedral vs. the Kremlin, and I am sure of my decision because this is not your regular cathedral. I have never experiences several cathedrals within one. The artwork is amazing and you cannot skep visiting the inside of St. Basil. IT is as beautiful as the outside"
257,Good place to visit,"This is a place not to be missed, but go with a good guide. it is much better understood given all the different rooms within the Cathedral"
258,Wonderful Icon!,"I'm sure you've seen pictures of this archetypal Russian Cathedral. Go and see it with your own eyes, you won't be disappointed. St Basil's has some pretty strong competition from its surroundings but it still stands out as a cultural icon. And you will get a surprise when you go inside and see how people worship there. Reccommended"
259,Magnificent ,It’s a must see for every tourist . We had the chance to visit the place three times . Focus on the outside nothing special in the inside .
260,Amazing church,"Impressive from the outside but again it was unfortunate there was construction in the area. So many tourists inside and out , huge queues to get in and expensive. Lots of steps to navigate. Amazing chapels and the different domes  and all the work inside."
261,S.Basilio is Amazing!!!!,"I visited St Basil's Cathedral this August, both outside and inside. I was very impressed by the wonderful architecture of the religious building. Outside it is so colourful and Russian looking. It is easy to get to as it's in Red Square at the center of Moscow. Inside it is dark and mysterious, with many small chapels to explore. There are a lot of big steps to climb, so strong legs are a must. Small windows look out on to Red Square and other buildings in the area. Overall it is well worth a visit if you are in Moscow, but go early as the que soon builds up."
262,Most Iconic Cathedral - from the outside,"As beautiful as expected. Vibrant colours and amazing detail . Just stunning, on this occasion did not have time to go inside."
263,Beautiful,Took a tour inside with audio assistance.  Incredible to see the history and spiritual significance of this world renowned facility.  There were lots of stair and it was quite confusing walking around.  But definitely not something you want to miss if you find yourself in Moscow.
264,A must see in Moscow ,"Typical picture of Moscow. In the Red Square, in front of the Kremlin. You have the option to get inside and visit few more small churches. Or just take the picture outside, but its a must if you go to Moscow!"
265,Stunning ,"A real pinch yourself moment, standing in the Red Square in front of the cathedral and the Kremlin.Ticket costs 700-1000R as far as I can remember for entrance inside. I would recommend as you get to see that the cathedral itself is made up of 9 smaller cathedrals.For students, they only accept ISC cards which is not ideal for the discount.I queued at the ticket office, waited only 2 minutes so no hassle not buying online."
266,Beautiful church,From any angle an iconic and stunningly beautiful building. You’re in awe just looking at it. The more you do the more you see the incredible colours and designs. Popular but you get plenty of chances for great photos. Choose a sunny day.
267,It’s really that amazing ,"If you are going to be in Moscow and have time for site seeing, this is a site worth seeing.  Take a few photos."
268,Heart of Moscow,"Inside was a bit dark , but it's worth a visit its really beautiful from upstairs you can take great pictures"
269,Must see ,"My foreign colleagues have been to Moscow many times, but never in Moscow underground. We had only one hour and made a short tour: Novoslobodskaya, Ploshad Revoluzii, Mayakovskaya, Belorussian. My colleagues were amazed. Moscow underground is the most beautiful and definitely worth of visiting at least once."
270,Beautiful Cathedral,"A great and unusual Cathedral, well worth a visit. Recently restored it is a must see as you will not see anything similar so easy."
271,Impressive!,"Beautiful church, must see when walking around the Red square. Entry tickets for 1000/700 ruble (summer/winter price)."
272,Beautiful building,We didn't have time to go inside but the exterior is so charming. It's very crowded at this time of year but worth the visit.
273,Beautiful building,"According to one theory, the cathedral symbolizes Heavenly Jerusalem, in other words the Kingdom of God, whose walls are decorated with precious stones. recommended to visit!!"
274,A must see,The cathedral is much more beautiful from outside. I wouldn’t pay to go inside again and don’t recommend queuing up for a long time as you’re likely to be disappointed.
275,Very beautiful!!,I expected St Basil's to be your average cathedral - you wander in and there is a huge open space and an altar at the far end.  This cathedral is nothing of the sort.  I don't want to spoil the surprise - just go in and see it for yourself.  It is magnificent.
276,A must-to-go place,"We were there during the week of the international military tattoo event (23Aug-1Sept). We bought tickets at 3pm and were mercilessly chased out by the staff at 3.50pm. The usual closing time is 6pm as stated at the ticket office. However, we weren't informed of the early closure at the ticket counter; as a result, we didn’t have time to admire the cathedrals and listen to the audio guide. Very unfriendly and unapologetic."
277,Magnificently beautiful church of Orthodox Russia,"Absolutely unmissable and instantly recognisable with its colourful onion domes (don’t' forget to take the obligatory selfie outside!). Equally stunning by day or at night when it is lit up.It was surprisingly expensive to go in (1000 rubles!), but totally worth it and actually very different to what I expected. It's a series of nine chapels connected by narrow passages rather than one large open space. The individual chapels are all different and we went round and saw them all. Unlike some of the other churches and cathedrals, you are allowed to take photos inside."
278,"The icon of the city, try to visit twice day/night","I visited during the evening, but the colors were still just as impressive.  Such an amazing sight- it's a must see!"
279,"Simply stunning, you should try to go inside",Delighted to see the old Annfield reopened.Tastefully refurbished to celebrate architect Sir Basil Spence.Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere.We just stopped for coffee and a snack but the burgers looked amazing.Will return.
280,Stunning,No trip to Moscow would be complete without a visit to Saint Basil's Cathedral. It's a must see and definitely worth it.
281,Not to miss,"It was declared in 1990 a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with the entire KremlinThis is can't be compare with Savior on the Spilled Blood. But it's very accessible as it's in Red Square. It has a similar outlook as Savior on the Spilled Blood. There are nine chapels inside and some are nicer than other. From June to August, it close every Wednesday., so please check it closing day before visiting as it can be  changed. This Catheral has higher security check than other, maybe because it's in Red Square. Don't use tripon or selfies - stick inside. Because of the unique outlook and prime location. I highly recommand u come here for a visit."
282,Beautiful from outside ,"Take plenty of memory card or video. Good place for people watching. Take your time.  Check out the other buildings they are also very beautiful,"
283,Beautiful,"The colors are so vivid photos don't do it justice.  We took the interior tour; wouldn't recommend doing so (a bit of a rip off, we thought.)"
284,A great photo background,It is a must if you arrive in Moscow. You can’t visit this city without visiting and taking at least 1 photo in this place. It is amazing!
285,Historic Cathedral,"You can’t miss the outside of St Basils but don’t let the entry queues put you off going inside.  The interior is as spectacular as the outside and comprises a series of small rooms and chapels; some set up as museums exhibits and others simply displaying the magnificent iconostasis and frescoes. I had seen some on line blogs saying that you only need 15 minutes inside but don’t believe them.  You may also be lucky to catch a small choir singing in one of the chapels. Photography is permitted inside, as opposed to the cathedrals of the Kremlin, which don’t allow it. There are two levels to the Cathedral and we made the mistake of going upstairs first – it is a one-way loop and the exit takes you completely outside the cathedral.  Fortunately we were allowed to skip the queue and re-enter immediately but we were concerned that it would not be permitted."
286,Vacation ,"Go, see, photograph it, go inside, see it, and know you have been there. Feel the history! Be apart of it! And listen to the priests sing, OMG so beautiful!"
287,Has a “wow” factor,"A must see of any trip to Moscow. An audio guide obtained at the ticket office was very useful.  I visited late afternoon in October, no waiting in line."
288,what a magnificent place,"In the late seventies I shared an office in the now removed Intourist Hotel at 1 Gorky St, and Gorky St.has taken back its original name of Ulitsa Tverskaya. The once ""glum"" G.U.M. department store has become a world-class showcase. Many of the Squares edifices have been encased in scaffolding, which in turn was covered with cloth replicas of the buildings being renovated. The bleak vending kiosk where all of Moscow re-used the same plastic glass to drink Kvass from has been replaced by all sorts of stalls. There is even a MacDonald's ! Sophistry is all over the place, even if it may be limited to a select segment of the populace. Today's Muscovite is more apt to be an educated, fashionable individual than their counterparts of the past, but they all share the resilience, strength and pride that was forged on the anvil of a tumultuous, tortured history."
289,Worth seeing,"We had a great wonderful tour guide, Maria Kalashnikova, that provided continuous history lessons and stories as we toured the the church and surrounding area, so now every time I see a photo of St Basil's Cathedral it brings back the memories of our visit to  Moscow."
290,A literally must see place,"St Basil’s is spectacular.  Be sure to spend plenty of time outside, admiring it from every conceivable angle.Allow at least one hour inside.  It cost 1000 roubles for entry and it was worth every cent. Make sure you find the narrow staircase and explore upstairs, the are many beautiful frescos and paintings."
291,Prepare for a surprise,"Even though I had seen pictures and movies, nothing quite prepared me for the magnificence of this cathedral.  I was totally blown away by its beauty"
292,Day and night,"Saint Basil’s Cathedral was built by the order of Ivan The Terrible in the 16th century. You will see it immediately when you approach the Red Square, day or night! The architecture and colors are striking and very unique. There is even a legend that the tsar ordered to blind the architect so he will not be able to recreate this masterpiece anywhere else. This beautiful cathedral is one of the most recognizable symbols of Moscow. Probably, everyone who visited the city, has a photo with it. But please do try to find time to go inside. For Russians the ticket costs 500 rubles and for foreigners- 700 rubles. Inside you will be surprised. It’s not done as one church, it has nine different in style and size chapels, connected to each other with corridors and passages. Very curious structure and beautiful look. Check out my photos."
293,Russian Icon!,"Dear readers,This is a must visit and to take a pic. It’s really beautiful. At night it’s in all colors of lights displayed and by day it is stunning too.The area is good to walk around and buy some Russian snacks or souvenirs"
294,You won't be disappointed,"Absolutely stunning to look at - no more needs to be said.I guess I was expecting stunning inside, but it isn't really. Because it's a series of joined churches there are no large spaces with awe factor. We found it quite hard to navigate, with small corridors and steps, and quite gloomy. Began to feel claustrophobic and needed to get out.If you want wow factor then I wouldn't pay to go in here, just admire from the outside."
295,Amazing,"The Red square and Kremlin are adjacent to each other in Moscow. The Red square consists of the St.Basil's Cathedral as well as the GUM mall. St.basil's cathedral probably features in every picture you see of Moscow. This indeed is an iconic church to and very different from any other churches or Cathedrals in Europe/Asia. The outside of the church in the wide Red square is very impressive than the inside of the church. It took us about 30-40 mins to look at the inside of the church.Evening times are better for the pictures as the sun shines on the church. Allow yourself enough time to soak in the views of the church and take some pictures. The red square is pretty crowded with tourist.Getting to the red square is pretty easy. There is a metro station right next to the Four seasons hotel. There are multiple lines that can bring you to red square. Once out of the metro station it is about 5 mins walk to the Red square. Walking in the Red square and seeing St.Basil's cathedral is free, you will need a ticket to enter the church."
296,"I didn't go inside, but I took a lot of photos.",We were in Moscow as part of a cruise and had actually been delayed by hurricane Dorian so we arrived while our tour grup was out. So we took a quiet walk in Red Square (sort of quiet)  St. Basil'ss is just beautiful.
297,Colorful Cathedral,Really? You have to be convinced to go?  St. Basil's Cathedral was high on my bucket list.  Soooooo happy I came and I saw.
298,A must see in Moscow,"If you happen to be with your kids to Moscow and most probably to the Red Square, use a chance to visit St. Basil’s Cathedral!“Kill all birds with one stone”:- see the Russian Orthodox Church;- feel the taste of Great history;- touch a piece of art: icons, fresco, architecture.BONUSES: - luggage room from the opposite side of the Cathedral;- inside rooms & stairs are full of fun for kids (sort of hide-and-seek);- souvenir shop."
299,St. Basil’s Cathedral,"It was a great tour with a tour guide. If you really want to know the history of the object, take a guided tour. This Cathedral is stunning not only from outside but also from the inside. Another beautiful experience is inside in one of the small churches there is a choir of man which songs brings goosebumps. It was absolutely stunning experience."
