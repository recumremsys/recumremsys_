0,Just a statue ,"The significance of salty ears is important, but there is no sign explaining it onsite. It’s a stupid statue."
1,It's fun to visit.,"It's a fine and funny symbol of the past. There is a nickname for the residents: Permiak - salty ears, as there is much salt deposited in the area. You can put your head into the bronze ears and the bronze photographer will take your picture."
2,A funny reminder about hard work of salt carriers in old times,"Had just a short time in the city,  and monument,  along with the explanation beside it (as part of the green line walking tour,  in English as well!)  is a must if you come to perm.  Plus you get a funny photo with the ears and some historical details about the place."
3,Funny,A tiny sculpture in the city center attracts a lot of tourists with the possibility to make loads of funny pictures. A place to remember!
4,A must do in Perm,"That monument displays the funny story of old times. Perm' was a center of salt mining. People who where carying this salt from salt factories to warehouse were carying it on their shoulders. Salt was often droping out in their ears, then they became swallen and red. Therefore Permian people are called Permyak salty ears."
5,Fun Photo,The salty ears is a monument where you can take silly photos placing your head inside the sculpture. It is located on Komsomol'skij which is the main shopping street. It makes a great stop off point between the shops and the museum or the Karma River.
6,Metal sculpture in the town center,Walking in the town center you can bumb into this sculpture. It is funny but it is not worth to spend more than 3 minutes!
7,A glimps at the spirit of the city ,The monument with the history and with the sense of humor. Have been there with many visitors - it's fun to take memorable pictures and at the same time to find out some facts about the history of the Perm Krai.
8,Good start to the Green line,It is one of the most interesting places for tourists in Perm. But it is always a good memory to keep a photo from here in your album.
9,salty ears,"I would not actively seek this out. If you are on the way to something else and you pass it great! Or if you decide to follow Perms ""green line"" which is one of the best ways to see the city, sure it's probably a highlight but it's a photo op with a little bit of information attached. Nothing more, you'll be done in 5 mins max!"
10,Funny photos.,Very popular locally for taking pictures. It has to do with some phrase or saying about the local people and how they hear things.
11,Permyak,"A funny composition of a bronze photorgapher and a frame with big ears (you can put your head into the frame and have your photo taken). In old times salt was quarried in Perm region and many men worked as salt carriers there. As the salt scattered from the bags, the heads and ears of the carriers were covered with salt. It used to be a very hard work that caused serious diseases."
12,Salty Ears,"Having stayed at the Prikamie Hotel overlooking the sculptures, it was fun watching people taking pictures. If you are a tourist,  the city has two sightseeing​ self walking tours demarcated by painted lines on the sidewalks (red or green). At each historical or cultural point there are explanatory signs of the history and significance of the building or object of interest. The Salt Ears is on the green lined path so it is fairly easy to find it."
13,Its a pair of ears ?,"If you want to have funny photo from Perm, this is the place you cannot miss. Not far from main attractions."
14,Awesome for taking photos,The salty ears sculpture is great fun and a great fun opportunity for silly pictures. Also at start of green line which is a good and instructive walk around Perm.Story of ears comes from salt workers who had to carry bags of salt which caused the ears to go red and become sore. The main salt producers in the area where the Stroganoff family inventors of the stew. Heard two stories as to how invested one was that the Baron stroganoff had no teeth and the other that although fabulously rich they where also not very generous when entertaining guests.
15,What it says on the tin,"Just a spot for a photo op. Outdoor bronze (?) figurines. Perm was a large producer of salt for Russia, hence the Salty Ears."
16,It's fun but it is what it is,On your own or with friends this is great to have your picture taken.While you are there wander down to the corner and climb on the big bear.
17,Great for a photo shoot!,"This is a fun attraction in one of the main roads of Perm. It is a photographer taking a photo of someone with "" red ears"". You can pose with your face in the ears."
