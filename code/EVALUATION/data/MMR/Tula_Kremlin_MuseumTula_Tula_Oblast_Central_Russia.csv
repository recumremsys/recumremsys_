0,Amazing Kremlin!,This amazing Kremlin is well worth a visit. Much more impressive that Moscowâ€™s. Easy to walk around in a pedestrian area.
1,Lovely ,"The Tula Kremlin is a magnificent construction with churches inside. Once you are there make sure you explore every single church. They all look the same, but their interiors are all different."
2,Beautiful,"Where is the heart of russian cities? Of course in Kremlin. This Kremlin is very pretty, it's renovated, clean and green. Maybe you shouldn't take an excursion however with this ticket you can go to the wall. We've enjoyed time spent there. Please notice that the church in freshly renovated."
3,Great place,"I've been inside the walls of the Moscow Kremlin which has fantastic buildings, architect and history. But Moscow is overrun with tourists (yes I'm one myself!). But at Tula, the Kremlin only has limited - but still interesting buildings and architect in the Kremlin walls but it is free to enter, is seriously less touristy and you can wander around at a more leisurely pace which I found more enjoyable."
4,Beautifully restored ancient fortress,The Kremlin at Tula is beautifully preserved and the exterior walls and towers are impressive. Inside is a stunning Orthodox Cathedral (sadly not open) and a fascinating museum that tells the history of Tula's armaments industry from medieval swords up to Cold War era rocket launchers. I am not especially interested in weapons but the display is fascinating and there are a few reconstructions of old interiors that put it all in perspective. The ceiling frescoes are fascinating relics from the Soviet era. Taking photos INSIDE the Armoury museum is prohibited.
5,Kremlin,"Dear Travellers! I would highly recommend to visit Kremlin and especially because the visitor can have a rest from the busy noisy streets of the town of Tula and breath fresh air inside the Kremlin walls. And also there is an ancient museum of ""swords and helmets"" which is located inside the wall of the Kremlin. One can even try on the dress of a medieval warrior and mistress and have a sword, broadsword and glaive in the hand, a helmet on the head and make a photo with it standing on a Kremlin's wall. Great to see and visit the churches which are right inside this great architectural monument and of course they are themselves. Give a chance for this city to stay in your hearts with great moments"
6,Good couple of hours...,"One of the few kremlins than survived violent attacks for many centuries. Well-kept, with Cathedral and a great square. Very good views. Nice souvenir shopping in the Trade Halls (""Torgoviye Riadi"")."
7,Amazing,"We weren't as impressed with this kremlin as we have been with others around the country. There is a church in the middle, and a modern museum building, but not much else. (Unless you count the shops in the walls.)"
8,A historic place of Czar's Russia,"Just a quick walk around the gardens of the kremlin area. We were surprised that everything was perfectly clean and in order, the signs, the information board, the walls and the domes of the church, the gardens.. That's the way it should always be..."
9,Antiquity and modernity,What a wonderful place to visit! Calm and a huge park. It's amazing to be aware of that Kremlin is in several cities and not just Moscow. Tula has a very interesting history and is an old city. Visit it!
10,Great way to spend a summer afternoon,"Tula Kremlin is being reconstructed and museums redesigned at present, so there isn't much to see except from the inner courtyard and the church. Hopefully there'll be more to see and do by summer."
11,great historical place,"Kremlin actually gave me an idea how these are built around the different cities. For a person coming from the Southeast, it definitely was a 'view' of nice architecture"
12,Main thing to see,"In Russia a kremlin is what we know as a fort in america. We went in the afternoon, on a day that happened to be the day of the Gingerbread festival. The Tula Kremlin was bustling with activity: gingerbread displays, sales booths, ovens, dancers, a band was playing and there were old school kids rides. The traditional Russian entertainment was great. The Armament Museum inside the Tula Kremlin was pretty cool as well. Museum's are okay but, an inter active group of displays really unlocks one's understanding and can make or break an experience. Now this is a weapons museum with amazing paintings, displays and pretty cool architecture, along with having a lot of guns, rifles, knives, swords, and suits of armor on display. Quoting what a US Navy Special Forces guy once told me: ""to oversimplify the effectiveness and accuracy of gun or rifle-- accuracy is the ability to hurl the object coming out the end, down the rang in exactly the same way every time, regardless of what action happens in the weapon to make the exact same repetitive trajectory."" Having heard that I began looking at weapons in a different light, to simply look at them behind glass was okay, but I wanted more. On our way out an old woman stopped us and began fumbling for keys to a locked room. At First I thought she was mad, she was speaking excitedly to us in Russian, she was not mad. Behind the door was a room with the all too familiar smell of old military items, I was afraid to enter because of how the display was set up, this was one of those rooms you could look at but not enter, since the artifacts were lying about the place arranged in an outdoor scene. To my surprise, she motioned us in. At first I resisted the urge to touch anything, she started handing me weapons, it was so cool! Then she began dressing our friend and I in old Russian uniform coats and hats, taking photos of us with weapons. This made the museum experience for me. She took photos of us in uniforms and with weapons posed behind sandbags and tables, as officers, troops and as enemy troops. What a cool experience, and what a way to end the visit to a museum. This absolutely made my day.The church in the kremlin was a masterpiece both inside and out. The exterior had the towers and gold dome. The interior had grand ceilings with incredible paintings everywhere. It was absolutely breathtaking, unfortunately this wasn't interactive and photos weren't allowed. I enjoyed the Armament Museum much more.It was off to the tower and kremlin wall, we had to pay a little money. Again somewhat interactive, I enjoyed this. There were rooms with displays, and outer corridors to shoot at the enemies over the many decades of invaders of the past, from the Mongolians to the Natzies. Because of Tula's weapons factories, it has been a major target for the enemies of the past. As I checked this out I envisioned the days when bow and arrow and spheres were used for defence, to the time powder rifles were used. What an experience, knowing the history of the City of Tula. Tula itself is a city known for making weapons, gingerbread, and tea pots. I can't wait to visit again."
13,Walls and Cathedral,"The Kremlin looks terrific from the outside.  Unfortunately it is plain on the inside.  No buildings whatsoever except for the Cathedral.  There are some tourist shops in the wall, in a sort of arcade.  I spent a couple of hours there."
14,one of the main highlights of my stay in Tula,"Tula Kremlin is ages old and has a long and interesting history, its secrets and mysteries, which you'll learn if you visit the museum and one of the guided tours."
15,Great Architecture,"Beautiful church and park inside the kremlin. Also great little shops with all kinds of souvenirs: gingerbread, samovars, dolls, photos, art."
16,Beautiful castle and museum,12th century fort of Czar's Russia.  Has several museums including Samovars and arms. Has a market where soveniers can be purchased.  Nice place to take family photos with ancient touch.
17,Great place to visit and to get a rest of noisy streets of Tula.,"The ancient Tula Kremlin (built in the 16th century) with its walls and towers of red brick is in a very good condition. Inside the Kremlin there is a spacios green area with the lawns, walkways, lanterns and benches, a beautiful renovated orthodox Cathedral ( the 18th century, barocco style), the Exhibition Centre, the State Museum of Weapon (the old building) and an arcade of gift shops offering handicraft, souvenirs and sweets. If you are lucky you may visit an open air concert there. A very pleasant place  to learn history, to walk and  just to have a rest, ancient and modern at the same time. Free of charge (except the Museum of Weapon). The Museum of the Russian Samovar is just a few steps from the Kremlin."
18,Well kept,"Tula Kremlin has been used in combat only once, being defended by Ivan Bolotnikov against Vassily Shuisky during the turmoil that followed death of Ivan IV the Terrible. Though a part of Defense Line designed against Mongol invaders, it never saw an onslaught of Orda.Used as an industrial facility in Soviet times, now it is not only restored to its original state, but embankment of Upa river is turned into a modern city park.Beatiful place to visit, stroll on historic grounds and chill near the river."
19,Not much to do at present,"It is not big but it pretty. We saw a lot of weddings there and a lot of happy people. Unfortunately, the main cathedral was closed for repairs."
20,"nice place, bad time","The place is currently a huge building site but the plans look good with new parks to be added on the territory. All you can currently do is walk around the ramparts (for free). As a Kremlin it is pretty standard of those in this part of Russia, nothing particularly special but certainly worth seeing if passing through as it's on the main square in the city center."
21,Will be nice when finished,"Wonderful museum, a beautiful exposition of armaments from different eras. The results of work of famous Tula gunsmiths."
22,A good experience,"I have been here several times, I agree with the last reviewer's comments and we enjoyed seeing what is behind a Kremlin without the security involved in visiting the slightly more famous one in Moscow."
23,I didn't expect it to be so interesting!,"we came to the Kremlin in the fall of November, so the weather was really bad, chilly and rainy, but this place deserve to be visited, specially because along with it you'll get the Museum of Weapons and the Museum of Samovars. Worth seeing!"
