Life inside there is guess no less to a jail. Living in space crunching environment with limited access to food, sleep, limited supply of oxygen, having no idea when you get hit by technology driven enemy.  Salute by heart to all those unsung heroes!!"

37,Good experience ,"The trip to this submarine on the beach road is worth as it reveals many truths about the life of our naval personnel manning such vessels. The space for their living is quite cramp and task arduous to deal such huge instrumentation, guarding us from enemy's attack.One wonders how this 2000 MT vessel has been brought at this location to make an exhibit!The weapons inside, the engine and the water ballast chambers located in the belly of the submarine are awesome!The organizers and tour guides can be more professionals and polite not to push people to walk fast as the unusual sights inside does make a visitor crave for spending more time.A must visit for those willing to know about how a submarine functions under water!"
38,Wonderful Experience,"The site of a submarine on a shore is just amazing and that too when its one of those machines that took part in an actual war and survived to tell the tale, this submarine was part of the Indo-Pak war of 1971 and now is standing at the RK beach in Vizag for all of us to see and check out how lives of the brave men living inside would have been at sea. The tour is given by few of such men that once served in the same submarine during its service time at sea. Getting inside one can trully see what all kind of sacrifices our faujis do so that we can be safe, sleeping in conditions that would make most of us tremble and hide.A must visit for any one and everyone for sure."
39,Knowledge feet,"It is first time that I visited this type of Museum. Kursura as a museum ship in Visakapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Kursura has a length of 300 ft overall, a beam of25 ft and a draught of 20 ft. She displaces 1,919 long tons surfaced, 2,436 long tons submerged and has a maximum diving depth of 985 ft . Kursura was commissioned on 18 December 1969 at Riga, Soviet Union. She was India's fourth submarine. She was decommissioned on 27 February 2001. After decommissioning, the ship was towed to RK Beach in Visakhapatnam and was established as a museum ship, which is the first submarine museum in South Asia. After entering into the submarine some people may feel suffocation as it is very narrow inside. The guide inside the museum tell you about the history and parts of the submarine. One can easily realize that it's very difficult to survive inside the submarine. There are only a few free spaces inside the Submarine. I am surprise to see how the people survive in these narrow/ small place inside the submarine for months."

While getting through the submarine itself is difficult physically imagine the plight of the personnel working inside one. A person is deployed to demonstrate on the submarine. Also, visit the TU142 aircraft museum opposite to this."
45,Gives a good idea of the insides of a submarine,"From R.T.C complex: 900k bus pass thought Ins kurusura. This place is awesome to visit who loves to gather some knowledge and salutable those fighters.Yes, it require ticket and no camera clicks in the naval ship.You will feel the life style inside the ship and how complex it is to handle.

The very complicated web of wires & Pipes all around the inside walls of submarine shows and complicated engineering marvel Its even more exciting to know that how that such huge and bulky Submarine was shifted from deep see to this see sure. It takes a lot of pride to visit a solute a warrior submarine which was pioneer in the Indian Navy defense system ."
58,Amazing,"Excellent must see museum. Well maintained with good explanation. Hardly takes 15 mind and that's the least we can to pay our respects to the guardians of our seas and coasts. After seeing the movie Ghazi attack, my wife and I could visualise better. Unimaginable to what levels of personal sacrifice and risks that a Naval uniformed person puts him/herself in their line of duty protecting us."
59,A walk through the inside of a submarine,"One can understand how submarines are working, beautiful engineering. You can also spend seashore aside."
60,Submarine,After Watching Ghazi Attack Movie I always wanted to see a real submarine.  Amazing feel to see a real one only for Rs. 40.  Monday is usually a Govt Holiday here but to my luck when we reach of Monday evening it was open for our surprise to have a view.
61,The first submarine museum in South Asia,Must visit when in Vizag. The museum takes you through a submarine and aquaints you with the tough life of submariners. The Indian Navy has done well to preserve this national asset in an exemplary manner.
62,Must Visit The Kursura museum,"The Kursura museum is one of its kind in India, where a an actual submarine has been got on the beach and refurbished  as a museum. A visit to this unique museum is very informative and a must for any tourist visiting Vizag."

69,Nice,was insightful to look at last generation submarine. will be very informative if we read the information about the submarine and then visit. But still good heads-up about the submarine by the people in charge
70,First submarine museum in india,Submarine museum is a a unique 0lace that you don't find such a thing in many other places in India. You can finish the visit in less than 30 mts. It will be interesting to engineers by seeing the sophistication of engineering used inside the vessel. For others also it will be a new insight.
71,Worth to know about our Protectors!,I visited this place as I was found of Ghazi Attack movie. This submarine is same which was attacked by Pakistan during Ghazi war. I was amazed by the compactness of the submarine and wondering how our soldiers spent their life there. Respect to Indian Navy!
72,Must visit,It is one of the best sub marines museums in the country.The explanation of the sub marine by the personnel is good.
73,Great evening to spend,"It is 1st in Asia and second in the world Original Submarine.Informative & memorable experienceI saw reality submarine-inside   & surviving under water  and  working ways of NavyClose experience of original renowned submarine, its various parts  like radar room, control room sonar room and various weapons of war, & history of artefacts, and scripts and photographs.

There are staff available for guide and explain how it was works. It needs fee to see. For adult Rs 40 and for children Rs 20.
77,Insights to a submarine,amazing experience being inside and getting the knowledge of how people survive and be inside for 2 monthsits worth going !
78,Different Experience,Awesome place to visit good hospitality. Very friendly nature of staff. Very humble. And sea view is great . It's a pleasure to stay.
79,Good ,If you have watched the movie ghazi attack you will appreciate this place much more.. Its amazing what our defence and submarine does for nation .. Salute to them...
80,One of the first ,INS Kurusura is not only a museum but also gives takes you through the hardships faced by our protectors(Indian Navy) on high seas. This place is home for the submarine and the technology used in it to protect from the enemies and destroy them if needed. So this can help the children to bush up their bookish knowledge with a real time view of a protector under sea.
81,One of the must visit Museum in the City,"First time entry into a real submarine, very hard to stay there for a few minutes. Salute to our soldiers when they stay there for days at length."
82,A SUBMARINE ON THE SURFACE OF EARTH,A very thrilling experience to see kurusura . I saw the same when it is not decommissioned . Very great patriotic feeling when the guid explaining that kurusura hits ghaji  during India / pak war in1972. Worth seeing for Vizag visitors .👌
83,Must visit for everyone,Very unique place to learn so much about submarines.. never had imagined something like this.Watch movie named Gazhi attack before visiting this place
84,Disappointing,very old and need to show us the nuclear one if at all want to grow interest. Diesel engine is passe so is the submarine. Nobody cares even what to do with it.
85,good for a visit,"Anyone who visits Vizag definitely needs to visit this monument to our proud naval history. The sheer scale and size of this mammoth vehicle really gives a sense of wonder. There is a guided tour which explains the history and usage of the sub, but if you like taking pictures don't be like me and forget to buy a ticket for photos or you'll have to run back and buy another ticket. Still I would say it was worth every paisa. Jai Hind!"
86,Must See,"This old Sub marine converted into a  museum is one and only of its kind South East Asia. A visit to Vizag would be incomplete without visiting it. Located on the Beach road, its timings are 2-9 pm. (Monday closed)."
87,Poorly maintained by authorities,Wonderful and very knowledge visit. Specially translator explained each and every point of operation ship and how the soldiers will act when war comes. Very useful trip for everyone with includes kids.

93,A real war submarine,"Dear sir,Navyy submarine is located in  R K beach  visakhapatnam  it is open for all personals  n best for family  you will know the  life of navy person ,engg knowledge etc G S PATIL."
94,We will visit again n again,Must visit. The only Submarine musuem of India...may be one of its kind in the world. You get to see the full submarine end to end along with all the torpedo tubes and torpedo.It is extremely thoughtful of the then chief minister of Andhra Pradesh N Chandrababu Naidu to set this up.
95,INS KUSURA,Great experience. It is rarely get to see inside and close look at sub marine. right in the RK beach. ..
96,One of its kind ####,Excellent and Inspiring place with Kids. This is highly recommended place at Vizag; better still if you have seen through some of the movies on Submarine.
97,Experience the life of a sailor inside a submarine,This is a must see point as per me. We got a nice inner view and idea about daily life of our naval solder in a submarine.
98,Finally visited Kursura,"It is nice experience to see real submarine. Must visit.i. Tip: Monday to Friday, it opens from 02:00 PM to 08:30 PM. Saturday and Sunday it opens at 10:00 AM to 08:30 PM"
99,Visit of submarine,"It is a strange and great experience to see INS kursura submarine at Ramakrishna beach Vishakapatnam. Though there is small amount of entry fee to visit inside the submarine. The authorities will not allow to take pictures. There are persons to explain about the submarine.  It is great and felt very happy to see the submarine by civilians Thanks to the authorities for providing the submarine museum at RK beach.l suggest all visitors to see the submarine inside where in many unseen items are noticed. Hatsup to the system's provided by the then people as they all already grew and are more knowledgeable. Inside there is kitchen, medical facility,beds for resting,conference room,operation system if missiles etc."
100,Authority should be more attentive,"The Kursura museum is one of its kind in South India, where an actual submarine has been got on the beach and refurnished as a museum. A visit to this unique museum is very informative and a must for any tourist visiting Vishakhapatnam. Its a great place to growing our knowledge about the Indian Navy and Soldiers."
101,Submarine,"Only one in India. Must in Vizag. Staff is very friendly, they understand the age group of visitors and explain. They have different language slots. Very educative"
102,Nice place,This is a real submarine with intricate details of the machinery and models which is more informative and educative. A must visit place for every tourist.
103,Must not miss,"Hey there, INS Kursura being the Asia's first submarine museum is worth the visit. I had visited it in January 2020 along with a friend, and was truly inspired and astonished. This magnificent structure, and its glorious history would definitely ignite a patriotic spark in you. The various  stories , history, structure details and many such facts are narrated to you by the guide ( retired naval personnel) in languages like Hindi , Telugu and English. But listening to the glorious past in the local language is always exciting. Do give a time slot of 40-45 minutes minimum , to witness the the huge engines, the mechanisms and how 77 men shared 2 washrooms, 2 toilets for a month underwaters in such narrow spaces. The description of the interiors is worth describing, but I would like to let you, the traveller explore the next level satisfaction and with excitement.FEES:Rs 40/person - adultRs 20/person- children (below 12 years)charges for camera being separate.TIMINGS:Day	        TimingMonday	Closed / HolidayTuesday	2:00 pm – 8:30 pmWedesday	2:00 pm – 8:30 pmThursday	2:00 pm – 8:30 pmFriday	        2:00 pm – 8:30 pmSaturday	2:00 pm – 8:30 pmSunday	10:00 am – 12:30 pm                         2:00 pm –8:30 pm"
104,must see,Was visiting Vizag after over 20 years. Was pleasantly surprised to see the Submarine located along the beach walkway. It it worth a visit. this did service the country in the 1971 war so has history. Do visit if you are in Vizag. Costs Rs. 40 /adult + Rs. 50 if you want to click pictures even with your cell phones.
105,Business,"What could have been a star attraction of Vizag was diluted due to the lack of proper guide facility. there is a guide at the entrance to the submarine and he explains things for once and for all. This does not help. The various chambers within the submarine, the periscope, the place where the crew sleep etc should be explained in detail. Also , the  entry is not  from the hatch unlike the one i had visited in Sydney. This one has a very convenient door. Definitely worth visiting this attraction once. As, not many get an opportunity to see a submarine. There was some construction work going on with wooden scaffolding across the submarine which was not a good experience either."
106,SubMarine,Excellent experience. Very informative & triggers patriotic emotions. It gives an extensive information on a submarine operation. The interior of the submarine is explained in details & one cannot but appreciate the technical nuances of this ocean craft.
107,Great tour,"INS kurusura sub marine , a wonderful place to visit and enjoy a day time, a wow atmosphere , everyone likes the atmosphere and enjoy lot"
108,Museum,"Very Good. For Future Generation, It is best museum. It is also situated in best location that is beside RK Beach. Everybody must see this Museum once in life time. you feel best experience."
109,Not interested.,Good to see practically the function of submarine with explanation from the authorities. Very informative. However I suggest there can be a small auditorium built nearby to show a movie on the how the submarine wok and how they navigate etc. This will help the students and others to learn more.
110,Nice,"Great spot on the beach front in Vizag, it's clearly a very popular spot and a proud display for the locals. Pretty cheap to enter (free if you're military), well run tour and very efficient in/out process. Air conditioned inside, really well preserved. Tour goes pretty quickly but it's a great set up inside and very informative."
111,Submarine experience great to see at Vizag,Nice and interesting concept and but it leaves you desiring for more . The complete walk through is little rushed even though there wee hardly any people. Out of seven chambers of Submarine only two were explained by museum staff with very limited information . The museum does give you glimpse of Marine life . The complete walk through of the museum can be done in 10 minutes flat and hence one can try whilst roaming on RK beach. Ticket price is quite cheap.
112,View Inside,Experience how our navy works while on duty. It's the real submarine.I was not able to stand straight inside.Hats off to Indian Navy.
113,Worth visiting.,I had been to this submarine long back. I was so curious to know alot of things inside the submarine. Especially inside the submarine including the crew members bedding. Overall its very inspiring trip for kids. This really develops their curiosity about science.
114,Informative,Simply superb this is an one of most important part to see in vizag so don't miss its guys.. It is special experience to everyone who wants to visit vizag City.. It was located in vizag beach road
115,"must-visit destination"" of Visakhapatnam. ",Anyone visiting Vizag definitely should visit this to get a glimpse on submarines & the life of our navy soldiers. There is a guided tour which explains the history & usage of this sub. INS Kurusura was a submarine used by the Indian navy in the Indo-Pak war of 1971. Thereafter it served our Indian navy for 31 years. The museum showcases the life inside a submarine & hardships faced by our navy soldiers in the sea.
116,A visit worth every minute,Nothing much to see inside. Its look like all objects are created few are real. Kids will enjoy to see how its look inside the boat.
117,Worth visit ,It was good but was under construction out side but inside they tried to preserve it. You get actual knowledge what a submarine is and how it works
118,Good place,The vizag port of the Ins base is a huge one. There is a submarine on the beach which also acts up as a museum. Really intriguing.
119,A Unique Experience,"Must visit. One of a kind in India. Very less entry charges, next to the beach on R. K. Beach so there is no reason to miss it. Very informative and educational. Has air conditioning as well which is a surprise."
120,Educative Submarine Life,The experience of entering in a real submarine is out of this world.There is entry fee of 40 INR..It is a guided tour of both Tamil and Hindi...it takes 10 min for the tour
121,"Awsome, how in such small space our navy personnel live for months together guarding our country from enemy.",It's very interesting and offers good knowledge. Post ghazi movie you will find each and every thing very very interesting
122,Unique Museum,Must visit. I reside near by. Opposite that TU 142 Air Force plane which is equally good.  The whole area is very scenic adjacent to the beach. The beach is very rough and extremely dangerous for bathing. Parking is very limited.
123,Amazing... Wow... Experience of life time,INS Kurusura Submarine Museum - state of art technology at our easy access. One can enjoy with children on week ends in RK Beach.
124,Good,"You will get a glimpse of the hardships our sailors face while they are stationed in the submarine. The museum has direct entrance into submarine unlike the actual stair one which is used when it is in sea just so that it is comfortable for visitors to look around. There is a guide to explain about the submarine inside out to the tour groups. You can see where the torpedoes are placed, how the submarine is guided in the sea and also the rooms used by the crew. The guide also gives the tour in English, Telugu and Hindi so ask the ticket checker before entering the submarine. Do visit and get first hand experience of a submarine. This should be on your must visit list when you are in Vizag even for a day. Try to go at day time so that you can see even outside of the submarine closely. They use fans and AC inside the submarine so you won't feel uncomfortable even on a hot day."
125,Life of a Submariner is tough,We as 6 members went for a trip to vizag and we went this museum in the evening...This submarine museum is a delight to watch and PUBG lovers might really be pretty happy to visit this...:P cos there are numerous facts that we don't know about our country's security...only thing that was a concern is there was not much of explanation in the museum about the submarine...Please take your kids who are adventurous would love to explore this...ticket was cheap and it was a nice thing explore in vizag along with aircraft museum which is just opposite to this.
126,Excellent war memorial,This shows what the human brain is capable of to create. Amazing engineering and hats off to their thought process.
127,Must in Vizag,"Here is a chance for all to have a look as to how the defenders of our nation do it.Cramped living conditions, barely enough place to move around but they do this all the time. Go and see it for yourself. Its worth it. In fact more than worth it."
128,Good to know,"Fantastic and very inspirational place for all age group people. You can actually go inside and experience submarine that too above water. You can understand life inside submarine, communication, see torpidos, etc. Surely recommended place at Visakhapattanam."
129,Excellent,"Its a submarine, which took part in the war with Pakistan and which is kept at the beach as a museum, after its decommissioning.The entire visit inside takes 20-22 minutes which commences with an introduction in English about the submarine.Photography is allowed, provided you take tickets for the sameProsKids would love to see and feel a real submarineGood description of the operating system of a submarineSituated on the beach and visible from the main beach roadConsAdults might not find this attractiveOne should be careful of height as one need to bend down while touring the subVisitors might feel hot inside, especially in those places where there's no AC"
130,History and Pride,Nice place. Best view from the street. The place instills patriotic fervour. Good view of the sea. Nice demo.
131,Once Indian Naval Backbone,"Must see for everyone. Guide is available inside the Submarine to explain in hindi/english the details, can take pictures from outside."
132,the only submarine on surface,"The museum takes you into the Kursura Submarine. The ticket cost covers explanations by a Telugu / Hindi / English speaking guide. Its a bit claustrophobic inside, but you get a good idea of the insides of a submarine."
133,Amazing opportunity to look inside a real submarine ,"This  museum depicts the milestones of the evolution of submarine through artifacts, photographs and written scripts. It showcases the life inside a submarine and hardships faced by the submariners in the sea. Hats off to Our Indian Navy"
134,Submarine,"We dont get to see these types of vessels in everyday. Seeing the inside will give a glimpse of how difficult the life of navy people working on submarines. Eventhough this is an old one, but the level of complexity is good to understand."
135,Worth Visiting!,I visited INS Kuruksetra on 18th of October with my family. The technology in this submarine is awesome. Especially my kids enjoyed  a lot.
136,Only Submarine Museum in India,I have never imagined that I will be able to see/visit any submarine from inside. But this first submarine museum of India provided unique opportunity to me to see it from inside. It was very proud moment to know about its services for the nation.Must visit place to get lifetime experience.
137,INS Kurusura Museum,An actual submarine converted into a museum after it was de commissioned. Liked the way the staffs at the museum who explained how the submarine lived it’s days and a must visit place as there are not many sub’s converted into a museum.
138,INs,Most importantly for the younger generations to know something about history and wars...this museum is a best example....grt feeling while inside the submarine knowing how sailors live inside it
139,Worth a Visit,We had seen the movie Ghazi Attack and were really excited to see the real Submarine! The experience of the submarine awakens the patriot in you.The museum is well maintained. But the experience can be better if there is a guide to explain things just like in the Aircraft Museum.
140,A must see,Wonderful experience. A must visit place..really amazing to see a submarine which has won real war..and its inside well explained.
141,Must visit museum,"Don't miss the heritage and I feel I had not done it.  No words to say about INS KURUSURA MUSEUM. I LOVE IT..... once if you see you will feel in such away,  I missed to serve Indian Navy⚓"
142,Not so good,"Don't forget to take ticket for camera. Ticket needed even for phone cameras.After watching Gazi attack movie, I was curious to see a Submarine closely. It was really fascinating to watch it from inside.a very small kitchen, very small dining, very small capitan's room (with a small book shelf), very small bunk beds for crew and big torpedoes in front and back. Life of people inside must be tough. Salute to them.From front to back whole submarine was full of many many many equipments."
143,Naval ship.,"after watching the movie Gazi Attack, I wanted to see a submarine from inside, I could easily correlate the museum  with the movie and it was really exciting, if you are in vizag, you cant afford to miss it"
144,a chance to visit the interior of a decomissioned submarine,"We as 7 members went for a trip to Visakhapatnam and we went this museum in the evening...This submarine museum is a delight to watch and country lovers might really be pretty happy to visit this..Those who see the Movie ''The Ghazi Attack ""'...they can understand it better..."
145,Museun Visit,Great location. Good tour and we'll maintained. Must visit for any kinda tour. Novel experience. Double thumbs up!!
146,First of its kind Submarine Museum of South Asia,"This place is too popular and situated near the RK beach, thus try and visit in the early to avoid the evening rush. Timings are 2 pm to 8.30 pmThis is one of a kind place where you will witness the life of the navy men.Their life might appear merry and happy, but its totally different.A must visit for its one of its kind.P.S- Entrry fee applicabeCamera and video charges are extra.I have a full video on Youtube about Vizag. Channel name- Khushi NotOnlyMakeup"
147,Salute to Indian Navy 👍,"The museum is famous in Vizag. The museum is located near Rk Beach. The beach road is excellent design where they have 4 wheeler parking at one side and 2 wheeler parking at other side. The parking is free.There is a queue for entering museum after taking tickets, they allow approx 30 people in one batch. The museum has AC inside. Their staff will explain you about the history of museum, then you can walk through it by viewing different sections.The museum will make you experience how the naval people used to stay inside in those cramp chambers and devote their duty to our nation. Proud of them !!"
148,A submarine which is proud of India.,"INS Kursura, has a glorious history in defending Indian shores. And now, INS Kursura, located snugly on the East Coast of Vizag. India's first submarine museum and first kind of in South Asia. Visitors can see the torpedo rooms and crew quarters, view the once top-secret sonar and radar rooms and the top-security submarine control room. Kursura had played a stellar role in the 1971 Indo-Pak war."
149,Real submarine,"INS Kurusura Submarine Museum is very attractive to the people to visit and experience the physical look of a submarine. It is a well planned museum within a restricted space at an ideal location. But the guides do not take serious care about the tourists to explain the museum. A general complete tour takes about 5-7 minutes in which the tourist travels from one end to the other through the submarine. The tourists who purchase tickets for photography even get frustrated at the end as because he could not identify the important features to click. If the authority takes initiative in deputing enthusiastic and sincere guides within the museum, it would attract more tourists and would create larger interest among the public towards this unique museum."
150,A must visit,"The staff are extremely good and cooperative. How the navy personnel stay inside a submarine is a thing that can rarely be imagined. After visiting this place if you read those Alistair McLean novels you will feel good about this place. Wonderful treat to visualize. If you want to shoot pictures inside, please buy a proper ticket, else keep the cameras tucked in. This place has cc tv monitoring so remember your actions are watched,"
151,"Submarine Museum INS Kurusura at RK Beach, Vizag",I have seen this one first time in my in life. It's very good experience. We can go inside and see the sub marine. Guide will explain about submarine for 5 mins and then we can have walk through.
152,Submarine museum - super experience and salute to our navy,cannot miss it while in Vizag. went there twice. well maintained and well explained. could understand the tough conditions that the sailors had to face.
153,Excellent museum,"Sub marine which was purchased from Russia in 1969, we are able to see inside with a fee and they brief us  before we start to see inside. worth"
154,A View to Tough Life of Navy People,"Located right at the beach, amidst market, this unique museum attracts huge amount of tourists towards itself. One takes the tour of the submarine and looks at fancy articles in it."
155,Kudos to the Indian Navy!!!!!!!,I visited this sub marine with family. Just for one visit it is ok. Not that great. 50 rs just to click picture in this digital world is not acceptable. Security gaurds are rude and does not look professional.
156,Once in a lifetime,"The museum is established at the beach of Rama Krishna, Vizag. INS Kurusura was a submarine constructed by Russians in the year 1969. It reached Visakhapatnam in 1970 via the Baltic Sea and since then served the Indian Navy and served for 31yrs. It played a vital role in 1971 war against Pakistan. Decommissioned and turned into a museum. One can easily familiarize with all aspects of submarine life/machineries including weaponry.Its length is 91.3 meters and breadth is 8 meters. The INS Kurusura submarine played a vital role in a number of wars including the 1971 Indo-Pak war.The visiting time is between 2PM to 9PM daily which is pre-extended on Sunday from 12Noon. Entry fees for all and photography is chargeable."
157,Treat to be inside a real submarine,It is of the must visit museum in vizag. Very few will get the chance to get in to the real sub-marine. The retired INS kurusura museum will give that chance to all of us. The guide inside the museum explains in detail about it's operations inside the Sea.
158,Must see musuem,Good to see submarine here and near by aircraft..everyone please come and enjoy the moment. I enjoyed a lot.
159,Seeing it is a privilege in itself,A nice museum which you can enjoy with your family specially children and its inside view is really different.
160,Must visit,"This is only museum of it's kind - a tour inside the actual Navy submarine. Interestingly, the submarine is yet not ""decommissioned"". The officer on the submarine told that though it has been withdrawn from the active service, the submarine is still part of Navy. As a rule, once officially decommissioned, it would be scrapped. This will take 30 minutes, and the entry ticket is Rs.40, and there is an additional ticket of Rs. 50 to use mobile camera inside the submarine. I would highly recommend taking the camera ticket as well, otherwise you would not be allowed to take pictures inside the submarine. It is very informative and interesting tour - can't even imagine squeezing in such small space for months together, not to mention the dangers thereof. Highly recommended."
161,A salute to our Navy,It's on RK beach with nominal entry charges. It took more than 1year to get this sub marine from shore to this place. Feel proud to be Indian
162,Best educational visit,Beautifully managed sub marine kept at sea shore for the young generations to feel it and see how it works. There are multi lingual guide and a nominal entry fee. Photography not allowed inside the vessel. It shows how the Navy personnel act and live deep under the sea.A must visit for all!!Recommended
163,Excellent,"For all those of us who want to experience how the people survive in a constricted environment several feet below the sea, its a perfect place. Situated on the way to most of the tourist attractions in vizag, it is a nice place to visit. It will take 20 minutes of your time to go through the guided tour of the intricacies of life on a Submarine. The guide will tell you about how the marines lived, where the controls usually are and the history of the Submarine. At the end of the tour, you would have had the unique experience of boarding a real submarine, though a decommissioned one."
164,Submarine Museum,I was emotionally overwhelmed to see not only the intricacies of a submarine but also to imagine the tough conditions in which our marines live in order to safeguard our borders and to protect us. A must watch for all the Indians and hats off to all those who operate these giant machines in the sea.
165,Submarine museum,It was worth visiting this as we could get to see what does it looks like inside a submarine. We will appreciate the effort of people staying inside submarines after seeing the narrow passages and limited space between so many systems. But we do not have enough time to see properly due to lack of time. There is huge rush and we have to get out of it very quickly and cannot spend enough time inside. At least we should get 15-20 minutes inside to see it properly. This is not really a guided tour. They talk very briefly for a minute or two when we enter and then let us go through it and at the exit also a 2 minutes commentary. Overall it is good to visit one time.
166,Must See Place,INS Kursura Submarine museum is very informative and knowledge oriented. By visiting this we can know about submarine technology and process. Now outer look of the submarine has been improved. Night time it is glowing with yellow coloured beem from end to end in submarine which attracts spectators.
167,An Incredible Experience which will make you proud of the Navy,"An experience of a different kind - visit to INS Kurusura submarine musuem, located at RK beach, Vizag. A must for school going children and young adults to get a feel of those heroes who guard our waters, cooped up inside the confines of the submarine.Commentaries in Telugu and Hindi/English by the navy men, who are always willing to answer your queries. Entrance through tickets (Rs 40 per adult), which is well organised. Located strategically on the RK beach, do not miss this important landmark of Vizag."
168,Wonderful place to visit,The INS Kursura is a unique museum in that it is an actual submarine that has been pulled ashore and grounded on the beach and thereafter converted to a museum. A visit to this museum gives one an insight to the life on board a submarine in a very vivid manner. A must visit attraction in Vizag.
169,Nothing to define,"Learning experience. Got to know how difficult is it to stay and operate in a submarine.Hatts off to the NAVY!if you are in Vizag, go see!"
170,Surely would give you goosebumps,"Most usually we never get to visit a submarine, that too one with a very interesting history. This Submarine would get us to feel the life of our navy men inside these submarines and how they would hit the enemies. Btw, this is the submarine that was actually mentioned in the movie The Ghazi Attack.If you visit this, there is also a Fighter Plain museum opposite to this. Don't miss that one too."
171,Historically impressive views,"You have to, have to visit this! A real life submarine and an opportunity to be inside it, not everyone gets it. Their person guides inside. Too good a place!"
172,Interesting,I have visited this place i guess almost 5 times till now. But every time i visit it again it leaves me wid a new discovery inside that gigantic submarine. Last visit of mine was wid my parents n my brother n his wife. This was their first visit to something of this sort n they were really awestruck by what they say. The guides who are inside the submarine are really knowledgeable n will give u good facts about the history of it. It has a lot of intricate details which u wont be able to cover in one visit. But it will surely give u a feel about the life of a seaman who takes the voyage wid similar submarines thousands of feet below the surface of the sea and about their rat-hole kind of life. Make sure to purchase the ticket for photography as it is mandatory if u wanna click pictures. I always prefer the evening timings to visit as once u come outside u can enjoy a little bit in the small garden which faces the ocean n enjoy the sea breeze.
173,Too Good and really worth to visit...,Exhibitor not so elaborate. Perhaps get exhausted repeating same words for years. But nice place to visit
174,artificial fish,This is perhaps the only actual submarine which one can see and visualise the toughness required to be inside there for a prolonged period. Very very good experience and extremely informative
175,Must visit,The submarine museum is a very good museum which after buying tickets takes us to the submarine inside and it has lot many information to see and watch around. It has very good learning information.
176,Excellent and Inspiring place with Kids,The INS Kurusura submarine museum is a must visit place in Vizag. The people at the entrance and exit explain the characteristics of the submarine very well and we end up feeling proud to be an Indian when we complete the tour!
177,Informative for children...first musuem in south east asia,"This is a must visit attraction in vizag, If you are interested in history or how a submarine works. The guided tour explains clearly of different compartments in the submarine and their functions. The highlight is the crew quarters and their living conditions."
178,Informative and worth visiting,The Kurusara submarine is a memorable place to see.There is a ticket for Rs 40 for Indians.A real time submarine with all the portions can be seen from inside.A guide tells you the details of the submarine.Worth seeing.The submarine is at Ramakrishna beach.The inside photography can be done by paying extra fee for camera only.
179,Breathtaking experience,Only one of its kind this side of the world. Gives a very good perspective of life on a submarine.Kudos to the Indian Navy and VUDA for the Submarine Museum. Recommend to be part of ones itenary  on their visit to Visakhapatnam.
180,worth visiting,Very nice place to visit to see inside the submarine. It's been designed with now AC to keep visitors cool n enjoy d machines sight. How actually it works in reality. It was an estatic moment to visit a submarine.
181,Worth experincing submarine from inside,Museum of old submarine INS Kurusura is on RK beach Vishakapatnam. Must visit if you are in Vizag. There are guides to explain about submarine.
182,history before eyes..,The  real sub-turned-museum is the most prominent landmark on Ramakrishna Beach. The entry ticket prices are INR    40 per person for AdultsINR 20 per person for Children (Below 12 years)INR 50 for Still CameraINR 200 for Video CameraINR 10 per person for Children in Group (Group above 20 nos.)Working Hours Tuesday to Saturday 1400-2030 hrsSundays 1000-1230 hrs and 1400-2030 hrsMondays closed
183,Ultimate Caves,This is an old Russian Submarine of 1969 resting near the beach. The authorities have put gates for the entry and exit. One can buy the ticket and pass through inside of the submarine. We can appreciate the condition under which our naval forces  ork
184,Must watch!!!!!!,After the decommissioning it was preserved as a museum for normal public access on RK beach in Vizag. Its the first submarine museum in South Asia. There is guide available inside who explains about the submarine in English and Telugu.
185,One of the must see places in Visakhapatnam...,"Nice little bit of Indian history which is not easily seen in other cities. I would suggest u do the tour in two parts, first visit the submarine + watch Ghazi attach movie. It's right on RK beach. Directly opposite to Aircraft museum so u should I think first visit the aircraft museum, next come here to see the submarine, finally spend time on the beach.  Ticket is 40/- per person. Tour is for about 10mins."
186,"Nice Monuments to visit, specially for Technocrats ",Excellent display of the submarine parts. Very well maintained with proper explanation. It takes maximum 15 min to go through all the displayed parts and components.
187,Submarine museum,It's a submarine which one must not miss to visit in vizag. Closed on Monday.We can go inside and the guide will explain about how the people used to survive inside it.
188,Gives an excellent feel,Submarine is well maintained giving a good insight to how submariners lived and worked. 40 rp for an adult was reasonable
189,Family trip,"When I visited this place, I knew that this is very special, so I visited this.  There are only 5 in the world, and this is one of them, It is real submarine and you go inside it to see how is life in Submarine under water."
190,Good to see Submarine ,If you are at Visakhapatnam you must really see this. The submarine is no more active and has been turned into a museum now. There was a huge investment made while towing the submarine to its final location. I enjoyed here and my family too!
191,A Must See Place in Visakhapatnam,Only submarine museum in India.Must visit place and won't take more than hour to finish the tour.Submarine is divided into sections and there is an expert to explain the significance of different parts of the submarine.I had watched the movie 'Ghazi attack' and could totally relate.
192,Must See,Good place to visit .Worth watching the technology and experience we never come across.Need a complete day
193,Proud of my India's Navy,"It's not often that one gets to go into a submarine. It's good to see such naval and military artefacts available for public visits. The staff is not the friendliest, but being a one of its kind museum it's worth a visit..."
194,Couple trip,"A visit to Vishakhapatnam city is incomplete without visiting the INS Kursura Submarine Museum. A must visit place at Vishakhapatnam indeed. Commissioned in 1969, the Kursura Submarine was decommissioned in 2001 after which the submarine was towed to the current location of the museum near the famous RK Beach. This is perhaps one of the few submarine museums of the world, which has retained its originality. After conversion into a museum, it was opened to public in 2002. The submarine has 7 compartments inside including well maintained cabins, kitchen etc used by the crews during operational times. Though signage was available in each compartment, there was no Guide available at the time of my visit to provide clarifications. The museum is very well maintained and walking inside the museum was a lifetime enlightening experience for me."
195,Must see place. ,This is the best knowledge place at Vizag for all age group visitors and is available only at Vizag in India.  A good opportunity to learn about scientific phenomenon behind Submarines...!!
196,Worth a visit!,"Visiting the INS Kursura is no less than an adventurous thrill. Located on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, at Ramakrishna Beach Vizag, this place is definitely a very perfect place for marine lovers as well as future naval personnells. The curator here is an awesome navy retired person, who will explain you the different components of the submarine as well as will make you aware of the various terms and weapons used by the navy like the torpedo, etc.Officially known as S20, this submarine was converted into a museum by the Andhra government. This place is definitely worth giving a visit if you are on a tour to Visakhapatnam."
197,INS KURUKSETRA,The INS Submarine Museum is the one and only Submarine Musem In the states of Ap and Telangana. It is the best place to take children who are interested in technological innovations. It will demonstrate how the submarine will function.
198,Good to see one time,This submarine museum will give you a once in a life time opportunity to see how our brave naval officers work in difficult conditions.Make sure that you buy for camera tickets before entering because they do check for the same inside. A must see for everyone especially if u have kids with u.
199,Once in a lifetime opportunity but could have been done better,"Seen a submarine for the first time in my life, it's very big and interior is full of control panels, gears etc. Got to know about the life in submarine. It's really tough and challenging"
200,Worth the time...,"One must not miss to visit INS Kurusura submarine museum which inspires everyone. Nominal entry fee of Rs 40/- not expensive. Huge submarine which took part in war against Pakistan and after commissioned placed as museum on Ram Krishan beach of Vizag. Many of us see submarine in movie or on TV but rarely we get glimpses of inside  so when we enter inside , it is amazing to see every part of  submarine. After entry, guide tells history and explain various parts which includes missiles, dining place, and other parts. It take 20-30 minutes to see Kurusua and one can realise how life is hard to live in submarine. salute to our navy and brave soldiers. After coming out of it, surrounding also worth to watch with waves and breeze from the sea."
201,Only Submarine Museum Of Asia,First time I entered a submarine so it was an amazing experience. The museum is located on the RK beach. A must visit if you are in Vizag.
202,Very unique experience to see inside a submarine,The trip to this submarine was not worth.The organizers and tour guides are not professionals and they do not know how to talk. The tour is very short and not worth.just walk through the ship and thats all.It gets over in less than 5 mins.
203,Unique place,Once in a lifetime experience going inside an actual submarine( the first commissioned for SE Asia). The entire experience is humbling and makes you realise the extreme hardship faced by our navy in protecting our waters from enemies. Hard to imagine how they spend days/months in such cramped quarters. A big salute to our brave hearts. I would highly recommend a visit to this unique museum.
204,EXCELLENT Insight to Submarine,"A U U U Subrine,BUT PRESENT IN,U U MusimuimROMs are very good and lovey four pointMY favurite place"
205,A great experience.,Nice stuff inside the museum. It felt very good roaming inside the sub marine. Lots of kids come to see this every day and the rush increases on holidays
206,Good to see,It is what is a submarine on the side of the beach. It’s big and in need of final restoration.........is a sub
207,A eye opening educational experience ,I had pinned great expectations for this trip. It was belied since the visit is only a passage thro different chambers with no one to explain its significance. There were 2 guides and one of them was visibly irritated when questions were posed. Indian navy could better. If u want to get an idea as to how a submarine is in its inside please go ahead. Dont expect to be wiser when u r out.
208,INS Kurusura Submarine Museum - state of art technology at our easy access.,"The museum is one of its kind (though other countries have such marine museums). It is indeed a privilege to get in and experience how life for our navy is, in the deep sea.We went to see it in the evening (it was already dark) and there was a huge queue, though quite fast moving. It looked awesome from outside itself. Tickets - adult Rs.50, camera (incl. mobiles) Rs.50. They allow photography inside.There are 6 chambers connected by passages in a serial fashion; you have to simply move in a line. Exhibits include the technical apparatus and life size human models at appropriate chambers inside.Caution - it is a No No if you are claustrophobic !! The entire interior passage is quite narrow and has low ceiling. There’s no point of return (as there is only space for a single line that can only move ahead)."
209,Very beautiful.,Fascinating work of engineering. A very proud demonstration of the Gazi attack success factor. Worth watching.
210,Don't miss it...,"Must see in Visakhapatnam,  just half km walking distance from rk Beach🌊☀, beautiful designed marine drive road,  feel that we are in foreign countries, navy life is full of struggles .when I  visit, I feel proud to be INDIAN, and salute to Indian Navy,  Jai Hind 🌈🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳"
211,Was good ,"Hi Again !!,A Must visit when visiting Vishakapatanam , a little history , located near the RK Beach and another must visit site just across the road."
212, Iconic place of Visakhapatnam,A Kalvari class Diesel electric submarine which was decommissioned in February 2001 was placed on the shores of  RK beach at Visakhapatnam.  It is one of the very few submarine museums in the world which is preserved as much as possible to the original state of operation.  It is  must visit place if you are in Visakhapatnam
213,A Unique Museum,"I am excited to see this. Everything well arranged to comfort the crew staff. Dining, Kitchen, Retiring and sleeping rooms are examples to accomodate in small places. Guides tell us about the operational procedures in detail."
214,Get a peek inside the tough life of the navy brave-hearts who spend months on end in a submarine,This place is a must see place in terms of unique item and also historical importance. This place is Monday close.
215,Must visit ,"Had a very good time visiting INS Kursura. It is really worthwhile to know about ships, submarines, aircrafts, etc. and this time I visited submarine. Really excited to know about it. Many things I learnt. I visited it with my family. Learnt a lot about our warcrafts, but many you can't understand if you are not interested to know. My advise is that before visiting any new place, just know about it briefly through websites or books so that you can enjoy more and learn more about it. It gives a good idea about what you are visiting. But this in Vizag is a must watch."
216,Must visit place for students..,"This museum is not only majestic and well maintained, it is also a unique opportunity for an interested common man to get to go in a naval submarine and explore the intricacies of its functioning and hardship of living a life there by our naval warriors. It's an eye opener that such difficulties are faced by our protectors while doing their duties. The sense of pride and and humble you feel here is overwhelming. Must visit n feel proud."
217,Ghazi attack memories,"every ten minutes eight people are allowed to visit the interior of this submarine.  It's 300 feet long and was commissioned in 1969 in Riga (then the Soviet Union). It was involved in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.What you can see is how/where men slept. The tiny wash basin. An awkward toilet (hopefully not behind a glass door as it is now). The officer mess. Endless cables, machines, the kitchen, etc. Mind-boggling. Narrow hallways. How people made it under such claustrophobic conditions is beyond me. It's worth seeing - for sure. Right above the beach. Easily accessible."
218,It is nice experience to see real submarine,"Choose the best time when there is less crowd so that, you can enjoy the most. Shows most the systems inside the Sub and its a treat to watch and eye opening experience."
219,Inspiring...,"Get an idea of how hard life inside a submarine can be with this visit. From tiny kitchen to a tinier bathroom, to bunk beds and beds on the floor, you just can't do anything else but feel awed and even grateful to the naval bravehearts who stay in such tough conditions and do their work all day - day after day, month after month to keep our nation safe. And if you've seen Ghazi Attack (which showed the sinking of PNS Ghazi - the Pakistani Submarine, off the Vizag coast on December 3, 1971, you have to put a visit to the Kursura Submarine museum on your bucket list."
220,Leaves you desiring for more,"It is worth a visit to see, study & understand the life inside a Submarine. The only submarine museum in India which is well maintained & open to public. You will be briefed about the basics of submarine & they allow you to take pics inside the Kursura. You can see the parts, weapons & systems used in submarine."
221,Kurusura submarine vizag,"A very good place to visit with friends and family members,this museum located in a long stretch of beach road. A lot of food points to have some special food items of vizag."
222,Best Museum,A walk through of the famous Submarine gives an insight into the life and living of the soldiers inside the tiny submarine under water.
223,Worth watching,"One of a kind....the only submarine museum in the whole of Asia (as mentioned by the attendant), this is an experience of a lifetime for a civilian. Entry fee is just INR 40/- and an additional 50/- for the cellphone camera. The submarine was purchased by the Indian Navy in 1969 from the erstwhile USSR, and decommissioned in 2001, was active in the pre and post 1971 war with Pakistan. With a crew capacity of 75, including sailors and officers, the submarine could dive up to a depth of 850 meters and had a top speed of 15 knots when submerged. Had an arsenal of 22 torpedos and 44 mines. The entire submarine with all its machinery, fittings and fixtures is on display. The living quarters and all other regular activity sections are well depicted inside the submarine with human replicas. It feels surreal once inside and makes you ponder on the fact that the crew spends days and weeks submerged in deep sea, with the risk of never seeing daylight again.....just to ensure that the rest of us are safe and sound....."
224,GOOD KNOWLEDGE ABOUT  SEA LIFE,"Only an insight of a sub. Not quite a place to visit for holiday trip, just while roaming on the beach can go and visit to see how it looks inside a sub."

229,Must visit,"INS KURSURA Submarine Museum is located at R.K.Beach. One can easily reach museum by buses or auto. INS KURSURA was decommissioned from Indian Navy in 2001 and then govt. decided to keep it as a museum. After entering into the submarine some people may feel suffocation as it is very narrow inside. The guide inside the museum will tell about the history and parts of the submarine.One can easily realize that it's very difficult to survive inside the submarine and will feel proud of our soldiers who remain inside the submarine for months, to protect us and our nation."
230,Only Submarine,"The guides give you a quick trip of the submarine. The submarine converted to museum showcase the hard life of mariners. The torpedo chambers (front and rear), Kitchen , toilet, rest rooms , passage, boiler room, etc are on display."
231,A slice of history and bravery for you..,"I've been in this city for long, however, could never visit this beauty. Strong as a fort, the submarine is an engineering, mechanical marvel. It's a short visit with 2 staffers helping with the history and facts, both in Telugu and Hindi."
232,Wonderful to be INSIDE an actual Submarine,"The INS kurusura submarine museum is the first of its kind in Asia . It was purchased from the Russians in 1969 and played a stellar role in the indo-pak war of 1971 ! It was decommissioned in 1991 and much later , in the year 2002 , was converted in to a museum . The submarine has been kept as it was , during its years of service . We enter from the front end and exit from the rear end of the submarine . It’s 90 metres long . The 90 metre walk is very exciting , revealing and gives us an insight into life on a submarine deep in the ocean !! The engine room is massive and is about 10-20 metres in length ! the captains cabin , the sailors quarters , the kitchen , wash rooms etc have been kept as it is , with some life sized mannequins dressed in naval uniforms ! The museum is manned by ex naval personnel ( I was told ) who give small snippets of information as we walk through the submarine . It’s a must visit site , along with the T-142 museum ( see review ) , in Visakhapatnam . I really feel ,school  kids should be taken to such museums so as to inspire them to opt for a career in the armed forces !"
233,Incredible,This was by far the best experience of Vizag and to actually be inside a real submarine. We loved visiting this place.
234,Must Go,"This is a old actual Kurusara submarine now grounded at RK beach and converted into a visitor friendly museum enabling everyone to experience first hand the inside tough life of our brave sailorsThere are various compartments with small sleeping quarters ,kitchen ,bathrooms and the operative technical spaces and one wonders how they managed to stay in such confined areas The torpedoes and their loading bays are both in front and behindThe actual ladder for entry is closed to visitors but available to viewFew guides are there to help out with information"
235,Submarine museum,Its right at tge rk beach in the city center . The ticket is for 40rs each which includes a guided tour of the submarine from inside. Its a worth visit abd hardly takes 15 min of yours
236,"Very useful information about Submarines for all age groups, the only one in INDIA.",Good one! It’s a nice place to experience the inside of the submarine. This is one of the must visits at Vizag.
237,Good experience ,The Kurusura Submarine is a must visit place for the tourist as it displays every aspect of a submarine and its operational procedures . It also depicts the life of the officers inside the submarine. There is a lot to learn about the submarine.

Not only is it the original sub that went under water but even the guides who explain everything inside are actual Naval officers who served in it for years. Really amazing experience! P.S. Do not take photos inside if u didnt pay for it. They will make u pay if caught!
241,special of visaka submarine,"There is a 40 Rs ticket to get into the museum and they are supposed to give a guided tour of the museum. However, there was just 1 minute intro given at the point of entry to the museum and then people just cross through the submarine not knowing what they are seeing."
242,Need serious upgraded one,"Charged at INR 40, this museum and its guides actually make fun of tourists. When we went, the guides were least interested in explaining. They were only interested in asking people to move forward. There are 4 sections, with 1 guide in each. Each guide  mumbles few words and gestures for you to move forward. What we gathered was that this warship was made in Russia, used for 31 years till 2000 by the Indian navy and then turned into a museum for people to enjoy."
243,place is good,Really interesting one. It was an official visit still enjoyed a lot. Very informative and a must visit location.
244,Fantastic Museum,We had an incredible guide take us through the 7 sections of this decommissioned submarine. We learnt so much about how a submarine works and also the important role INS Kurusura played in India’s naval history. Highly recommend.
245,Must visit,Nice to visit with family. You get to know about the life of Marines. It's situated on beach road in the heart of the city.
246,In a real submarine!!,"This basically is a guided audio tour through the interiors of a real submarine. The guide explains the different parts therein. There is an entry ticket. Situated on the sea shore at the RK Beach , tourists should visit this if they happen to be in Vizag."
247,Kurusura Sub,Have visited with kids and they loved it to the core! It's a once in lifetime opportunity to visualize how the life of a traveler in Submarine would be. Every moment spent inside was worth it. Remember to pay for the camera/video recorder.
248,Submarine museum,It's a real abandoned submarine which is now converted in a museum for the tourist to provide information about its history and war flights in 1971 war.Someone having interest in naval war ships would love to be there.
249,Its Just not a Museum but a place to revisit our history under and over seas,The submarine is situated on the RK beach and will only take little time to complete the visit. Photographs can be taken by paying extra at the ticket counter. A guide will escort you through the entire stretch explaining most of the things inside. The museum is open till 8.30pm.
250,Must Visit in Vizag,A must recommended place to see while visiting vizag as mine was a good experience to be in it as it was very real from inside.
251,Fascinating Visit,Great to see an actual submarine. Well managed entry and detailed information by staff handling the museum.
252,Worth a visit ,It was an amazing experience with family and relatives. Enjoyed every minute of the stay and worth visiting.
253,Experience of a life time,Visited when stayed in Vizhakapatnam. It is very near to Varun beach in fact walkable distance.  And it is opposite to Naval museum. Both are worth seeing.
254,Amazing Experience,"a submarine well preserved and converted to museum with very minimal change. a must visit for history lovers, war veterans and every indian to feel proud of our history."
255,A Submarine on land,"A must watch and a total eye opener, especially when you see and hear it from the people who have served on this very submarine for many many years"
256,Ins Kurusura,"Its worth a visit, the place is very well maintained and the tour though that will let you be wondering about the courage of men who served in the defense vehicle. A must visit"
257,Must watch with kids,"Fascinating unique experience, Nice to know the life inside an actual submarine. Good experience for all ages."
258,nice experience,"A Good opportunity to visit and see for oneself the insides of a submarine. An out of service submarine with suitable modifications for general public has been kept for visitation on the beach road. Though modern submarines are for sure somewhat different in their inside layouts and operational techniques, yet one can have a fair idea of submarine's importance in our national ocean security, the life of sailers inside it and warfare systems and logistics. Worth visiting."
259,"Worth a brief visit, especially for kids",It is a good opportunity for people to see what a submarine looks like from inside. There is a time limit for visiting hours as after dark it is very dark inside. People suffering from claustrophobia should not visit this place. Sometimes the airconditioning is not working.
260,Mesmerizing experience for kids!,Very well maintained. The guide there will give you things in detail which help us to get the experience or the situation navy has to be in....  Its always great to have something like this in the city as it help the new generation and motivate them to serve our country and how proud one can feel.

264,Vizag Submarine,Good opportunity to see and know various components of a submarine.The guides explained in detail about its life cycle
265,interesting insight,First of its kind and only in the country. Very informative and a good place to visit. Good to peek into the lives of submariners.
266,Amazing,This is a must visit because it gives you a full submarine experience which I believe no other city can give you. The site is very well managed and the guide explains things very nicely. The whole tour gives you a patriotic feel.
267,INS Kursura,"It's a good place to visit.... Well maintained by Visakhapatnam govt,Well organised city, clean, safe city,Museum was very nice well decorated"
268,only submarin to visit,"If you are in Vizag with family, dont miss this museum. Very well maintained, quite informative and a must visit place."
269,Naval Legacy,"A very unusual museum, the trip through the submarine is conducted by an able guide. The visitor is conducted through the narrow tubular space of a real submarine by an able guide, who explain the various features. One really wonders at the narrow space for work and rest of the submariners and is filled with pride. Hats off to our navy personnel for keeping vigil for our country , enduring such a tough life for the sake of defense of our motherland."
270,Well Kempt ,It is amazing to know life in submarine. But may turn out to be boring if you are in search of entertainment.The place needs better maintenance
271,A must visit if you go to Vizag,Nice and decent hotel... very good ambience... fair price of the hotel... food was delicious...clean swimming pool... friendly and courteous staff and could accommodate requsts of guests...One Mr.Kranthi made our stay very comfortable. Would recommend others to opt for this hotel when visiting Vizag.
272,Excited to see Submarine,"I guess most of  us will never get chance to board a sub, so this once was one of its kind. you get to see all the inner part of the submarine, including torpedos, caption chambers and engine.Must visit if you are in Vizag."
273,Don't miss Rare opportunity to visit a Submarine,"Not at all impressed, the whole boat was redone completely inside for tourists. You need to pay for the entrance separately for the photos inside, for video shooting is even more expensive."
274,Worth a Visit as could be quite revealing!,Nice to see sumbrine from inside. It's situated at the beach where you can enjoy both things beach and sumbrine visit. You will be going in group of 5 to 6 people as per the language you know guide will be explaining you sumbrine description.
275,Submarine visit,INS Kurusura Submarine is located in Visakhapatnam in India. It is the obsolete submarine which was presviously used in wars.
276,Exciting to see inside of submarine,Kurusura Submarine Museum is located on the Beach road. The museum is actually a de-commissioned Submarine from the Indian Naval Service.Guests can entry the SubMarine for a visitor fee and experience the details of the submarine. The total tour of the Submarine could last 30 to 40 minutes.
277,"AWESOME, DONT MISS IT.","The Submarine Museum gives you an actual feel of how it’s like to live within a submarine. A good place to visit if you have kids as there are lot of things that will interest them. Be prepared to stand in queue if u visit on a holiday weekend. Better to carry an umbrella or caps. The Submarine is INS Khurusa that was commissioned in Indian Navy in 1969 and was in use for good 30 odd years.The museum gives tour of the submarine that includes going through various compartments like where torpedoes are loaded, Captains cabin, mess, kitchen and various other compartments required for Submarine functioning.If you are planning a tour to this Museum, I would recommend going to Vishakha Maritime Museam first, its closeby and will provide a good perspective."
278,Enjoy,"INS Kurusura submarine museum established at the beach of Rama Krishna. INS Kurusura was a diesel-electric submarine of the Indian Navy, which was India's fifth submarine. Kurusura was commissioned by Russians in 1969 and was decommissioned in 2001. This submarine was participated in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 also.  It reached Visakhapatnam in 1970 and since then served the Indian Navy.INS Kurusura served the Indian Navy for 31 years and then it was decommissioned and turned into a museum in 2001. The INS Kurusura submarine museum at RK beach is the first submarine turned into a museum in the whole of Asia and second in the world. Various parts of the submarine like the radar room, sonar room, control room, and the weapons used during war are in display in this museum. The museum showcases the life inside a submarine and hardships faced by the submariners in the sea.Entry Fee:INR 40 per person for AdultsINR 20 per person for Children (Below 12 years)INR 50 for Still CameraINR 200 for Video CameraINR 10 per person for Children in Group (Group above 20 nos.)Timings:Monday to Saturday 02:00 pm to 08:30 pmSunday: 10:00 am to 12:30 pm & 02:00 pm to 08:30 pmContact Details:089125 63429089127 54133"
279,Experiencing life in a Submarine,"The museum is open from 2:00 Pm and often off on Monday. However, due to long weekend & vacation, when we visited, it was open on Monday also. It's worth visiting once to see the real submarine. It visit in itself takes hardly 10-15 minutes but you spend ~30 minutes in queues so this can be covered within 1 hour. There is nice aircraft museum just across the road so both can be covered in same day. There are many running on beach road so public transport and reaching there is no generally not a problem."
280,From the Horses Mouth,"It's a decommissioned Foxtrot class submarine which saw service with the Indian Navy and has been converted into a museum for viewing by the general public.It is easily accessible and lies in one of the best areas of Vizag, along beach road and RK beach. There is a nominal entry fee. There are staff inside the submarine, most probably ex servicemen who explain the equipment inside and the life in a submarine in English, Hindi and Telugu. The interiors have been changed enough to make it comfortable for civilians to transit. One can see mess decks, dining areas, machinery compartments and weapons rooms. Though it's not the exact experience if a submarine as doors have been cut out to transit between compartments while still standing straight, an external blower ensures continuous fresh air inside, much of the equipment has been removed to create more space for people to stand and lighting is much improved. But it's the closest a civilian can get to knowing life in a submarine."
281,Very good educational meuseum ,1. Simply awesome.2. ONe of its kind.3. Actual submarine that was decommisioned.4. TOTALLY WORTH IT.5. Don’t miss it.
282,Good only if you are interested in knowledge,I have never imagined to be inside  a submarine. It's a great opportunity to have a first hand experience about submarine. I express my gratitude to Indian Navy. The museum has been beautiful designed and maintained. It's a must visit for tourists.
283,INS Kursura Submarine,Walking inside a real submarine in itself felt thrilling.No guided tour was available.The officials manning the place were rude and their only aim was to chase people out as fast as possible.People should be given time and opportunity to realise and understand the greatness of the place and the history of the submarine.Might send visitors in batches for a better experience
284,One of a Kind. Historical. Never Miss,"Well, it was a short trip through the submarine but none the less an exciting one. We were briefed a little in the beginning of the tour and that's all. There were so many spaces one could not understand. Despite the rooms, spaces being labelled it would be interesting to have an audio guide that would have stories or instances  of the life in the submarine. I am sure that this piece of history had so much more to tell which just went untold."
285,Interesting history,Be it a kid or an adult. Taking a look at it from within is an experience and so is to listen to the officers who have spent their lives in it.
286,Seeing a real submarine,"Kursura Submarine Museum is one of its kind. There is a ticket counter before entering. Once you enter inside you are guided through the submarine with explanation in eithet Hindi, English or Telugu language. We were told that the submarine has been modified to ease the movement of visitors inside. Life of a submariner has been depicted through various manequins placed inside. Overall a highly enriching visit. We loved it !!!!!"
287,SUBMARINE INSIDE VIEW,"Having heard and read about Submarines, a visit to see the inside of it was really memorable. At the beginning, a person quickly explains in brief some details about the submarine and in small batches,off we go ahead and see it. A unique experience it was."
288,Not worth a trip,"Though the visitors are allowed only inside a limited portion of the submarine, yet, this is a very unique experience to get inside and see and then visualise how sailors stay and perform their duties within such confined space, and at such depths, with limited resources, and being lonely! Your respect for the naval men shoots up .  God bless such brave warriors!"
289,"Quick trip, Guide to explain","One does not come across a Submarine museum easily.The main constraint in a sub is the space. For example, an Officers dining table also works as an emergency operating table. For that purpose, adequate lighting has also been provided.Every inch of the space is optimised. I am sure life must be tough for the submarine crew to survive in it for months together. Hats off to them!Finally, the guides (retired Naval Petty officers) were quite knowledgable & explained the Sub quite well."
290,Unique museum,"My flight was delayed for an hour or so. So locals suggested me to use this time to visit RK beach and have a look at the Submarine Museum. Initially, I was reluctant and then I choose to use the opportunity and it was really awesome. This is really a once in a lifetime opportunity if you are in Vizag / Visakhapatnam must visit this place you will learn about the life of defence / naval force inside a submarine. really amazing a small area with more than 75 people without a place to walk properly or stand they spend a few days/months underwater. really mesmerising and salute to them."
291,Nice to see Submarine ,This is a Russian submarine which has been taken out of commission. It is closed on monday. As of July 2019 the ticket price is Rs.40/- per person. For still camera they charge Rs.50/- and for video camera they charge Rs.200/-The person giving the conducted tour is a bit rude and too reluctant to say anything. He just tries to show you the bare minimum and then leave. But the submarine itself is excellent. Must visit.
292,Kids will enjoy.,"Wanna know more about it, do visit for a new experience. I bet you wont be disappointed if you are a lover of history seeker."
293,INS Heroes,A visit to the submarine fills you with admiration and you realise what a tough life it is in the cramped space the crew spend months in. Salute to the Indian Navy who guard our seas with their life
294,INS Kurusura Submarine Museum,Great place to spend time for the evening. A walk through the naval submarine is exciting and very educational.
295,Nice to see India's first submarine museum,"My first time in a submarine. So far alright. Nothing to say. Its a rather smaller version of the submarine, but at least I have the idea how it was operated by the different staff."
296,Cannot miss it if in Vizag,"It is an actual submarine, acquired from the erstwhile Soviet Union in 1969 and de-commissioned in 2001. The staff on board look like retired Navy personnel, so tread carefully around them,especially with mobile phones!"
297,Nice experience to be inside actual submarine,"This is one of the must see places in Visakhapatnam. Situated near Ramkrishna beach, just besides the sea, wonderful scenic location. One thing to remember, this museum opens at 2 pm in the afternoon so can't be visited in morning, one has to plan in such a way that they reach it after 2 pm. 40 rs ticket required for entering this submarine. This is not a model or artificial structure, this is a real submarine last used in 1971 war , after that it has been brought to Vizag and turned into a museum. Authority let a group of people to enter together and a guided tour of 15 minutes begin. One can see the actual machinery used in the submarine. To remember that photography is allowed inside the submarine only if you buy a camera ticket of rs 50, otherwise you will not be allowed to click pictures though I have seen people taking pictures in mobiles without ticket!! It will be amazing 15 minutes inside a submarine.. outside the submarine there is a park where people can sit and take rest. Overall a great place to visit when you are in Visakhapatnam."
298,Great Engineering,"One of the first museums in a submarine. If you're claustrophobic, it may not suit you as it was a very tight fit walking through the submarine. It was quite touching, listening and seeing how the people had to live and sleep for so many days on end in those days. Very well maintained."
299,1st Such Museum to see.,"INS Kursura was a Kalvari-class diesel-electric submarine of the Indian Navy. She was India's fifth submarine.  An historic museum in India, Visiting this museum will give your first hand experience of what the navy crew goes through in their voyage. This submarine is one of the best attraction of Vizag. You feel so proud about the country after visiting it."
