78,Varca beach walk,"Goa, a relaxed place, offering plenty of natural habitat to relax. The best being a sea beach.There are plenty of beaches in Goa and one of the popular one's being Varca Beach. It's popularity is mainly due to central location, closeness to railway station and connectivity to South Goa. Mention of South Goa is required primarily as family vacationers like us visit South Goa for a relaxing seaside vacation and with Club Mahindra offering more than one options in South Goa vicinity, the mention is all the more required.Also, the relaxing and family traveler primarily prefers South Goa. Looking to be away from normal city hustle bustle, the serenity offered by South Goa is the primary attraction of a Goa visit.Varca beach, offers easy on pocket eating places at or near the beach. The beach itself spread across about 1000-1500 meters or probably more, is clean at fringes with central (near to shops and main entry) area requires more upkeep and cleanliness, even in off-season. The situation can be compelling in season - after October.A walk with alone, with your better half or kid can be very relaxing, the sound of waves throwing music to ears and collection of shells, a joyous experience.Suggested visit to the beach to enjoy an ice-cream (sold way over the MRP) is a treat in itself.Preferred suggested time to visit is - early morning - around sun-rise or late evening - around sun-set.Enjoy the sea , a tad away from central beach to enjoy the loneliness and feel nature."

The beach is big and you can have a really good introspective morning walk here if you have your head full of thoughts and want to think through...it’s so quiet and peaceful....as you walk along the beach you can reach Zuri resort and the Mahindra club which also have a good beach front but the stretch at Varca has less crowd so that’s the spot you should spend in the morning. Try to go a bit and early since the sun comes up early and it can be quite hot even in the morning. There are some beach sports which you can find on the beach stretch towards Colva

138,relaxing,Such a lovely beach with white sands and miles and miles of flat surface to walk. Early morning walk is a bliss. But approach to the beach from sterling resort is a difficult one. Though the road till where the beach area begins is a lovely one you have to cross puddle of water and walk through a wooden bridge to get into the beach. This area is unmaintained and dirty. Thankfully early in the morning due to high tides previous night this was clean but again in the evening when we went we just could not cross over to the beach.

148,Clean and Tidy.... ,"We did visit in the shoulder season, after an extended monsoon. The beach is beautiful, clean and not too crowded. At this time only a couple of beach shacks were operational. But we did get our share of sun beds and sea food. Unlike other beaches in Goa, this seemed to be devoid of hawkers, masseurs and their ilk. Water sports are limited. There are a few non-menacing stray dogs, and a cattle shed with the accompanying poop. Life guards are on duty.  Breakfast on the beach was beautiful, sunset was sublime. Perhaps peak season will interfere with the tranquility. But I will visit again in Novembers"

152,Awesome,"This beach is clean , well managed n less crowded. 3-4 shacks r there.All shacks are bit costly but food is good."
153,Swim from Varca to Benaulim along shore line,"Very clean,not at all crowded.Very beautiful and good for family.was very near to sterling resort varca ,Goa where we stayed for 5 days and enjoyed a lot."

155,No need to go to foreign for clear beachs,"Varca beach is less crowded beach in South Goa. There are shacks and various vendors on the beach.Watching the sun set over the sea while soaring high (parasailing), was an exquisite experience for me!P.S.-Water sports activities are available at Varca beach, but are expensive compared to North Goan beaches."
156,Leasure trip to Goa.,"each related to verca beach is good, but it is peaceful beach. not so happening for teens or young. very good for family"
157,clean,"Varca beach is not very populated. It is mostly visited by Club Mahindra guests who have an almost private entrance to the beach. Due to low strength of tourists, the beach does not have much to offer, unlike other goan beaches. Just one shack,that too underutilised/occupied. Beach per say is alright but no facilities for entertainment. Ok , if you are staying at Club Mahindra because there isn't much choice, otherwise not worth a visit."
158,Very clean beach ,"Calm quite and awesome ,Never imagine such beach in Goa.Very clean and zero disturbanceNo street vendor disturb you.Clean water Most important isSafe for families"
159,"excellent, clean beach",This place is opposite  of goa. Less people Less noise less pollution serene climate and nice sunset.
160,Amazing beach,Varca beach located in south goa..neat and clean beach Excellent view.. Very quite.. No more rush on this beach..no water activies in varca beach.. If anybody wants to relax for some days.. Then they must book resort on varca beach.. Like club mahindra varca or zuri resort..
161,A BEACH TO REMEMBER,"It's a private beach, very clean.Only the resort guests are allowed so you will feel safe as no outsider can roam there."
162,Avoid on weekends,One of the cleanest beaches in Goa and not so crowded as Baga or Dona Paula.. Its a white sand beach. Perfect place to enjoy waves or build sand sculptures. Definitely a must visit beach in Goa.
163,Clean white sands,We enjoyed with family. Nice relaxing mood the view is good and the approach is great. It is just walking distance from our room.
164,Clean & Pristine,"Very clean and peaceful beach. Not much crowd. Clear water. We collected many shells. It’s was a 15 minute walk from club Mahindra, so visited every day. We enjoyed it more than the other crowded beaches."
165,Great relax in beach,"this is really amazing beach, sand is so white and clear, I have never seen that much clear sand. its so soft you can feel as white flour. Amazing."
166,Beautiful and quite,Loved the beach ... as its clean and rare beach which got hard sand ... also good part is not too many people because the major beach axis is through hotel .....
167,Excellent Holiday Resort ,Very Calm sea.  Most of the people visiting the beach were from the nearby resorts and hence the crowd was bereft of any unwanted elements. Beautiful and clean place. You can spend lot of time away from the Hustle and bustle of city life
168,Pristine Beach ,Beautiful beach which is untouched and mostly visited by foreign tourists. The waters are blue and superb atmosphere. You feel like sitting there through out the day.
169,Silver sand beach,"Best part was a walKing beach, where early morning 6am u can plan a walk and early no.sun and low tide to enjoy freely."
170,Beast beach ever,"Nice sand and really quiet , five or six shacks serving excellent food and drinks.  Not had any problems in all my years of visiting."
171,One of the best beach in south goa,"Enjoyed our stay at Varca beach - club Mahindra resorts,  Goa. Enjoyed our vacation, just in the resorts.  Will visit again.  A nice resort to get away from our city life and routine."
172,"Beautiful, quiet beach!",This area is part of a massive stretch of sand the area called Varca is lovely only one shack and maybe a dozen sunbeds you can walk for miles either way well worth finding
173,Holiday spoiled,If you are looking for peace and tranquility with nice little restaurants on the beach then this is the place to be
174,Fabulous ,"I visited with my family and spent almost entire day here. Till now this is the best beach for us in Goa. Kindly avoid the beach shack at Varca beach, named Pereira's Sweet Hut. They cheat customers and food taste is not good."
175,Beautiful beach,Our property was on this beach and we thoroughly enjoyed walking on the white sands. Very calm with very few people visiting it.
176,"Fab, clean beach",Its a clean and beautiful beach with long open strech... it doesn’t have too many shacks but still one will enjoy the time here.
177,Beautiful Beach,South Goas has beaches which are less crowded and this one is one among them. The beach is good for a morning stroll or evening walk. There arent much water sports but you still can have a good time. There are small rocks a little into the sea which one must be careful about.
178,Peaceful Beautiful Beach ,One of the best and clean  beaches of Goa………….. white sand beach ………..Less crowded…..Less noise……unspoilt beach…. Easily accessible….
179,Personal family visit,We were travelling to Goa on a family vacation and visited Varca beach which was close to the hotel we were put up . This beach is neat and not crowded.... Good for visitors not having a busy iteneary and definitely this place not part of a defined tick check activity. The water is also not deep and good for people and children who want to have a swim in the ocean or get their feet wet. No shacks or sporting activity available currently on this beach however has a great potential to become yet another good Goan beach . Good for visit during daytime and avoid night time as not much of lighting or people around.
180,"Beach walk into serenity - soul, body and mind","I loved this beach. Clean, not crowded, beautiful. Spent 2 hours each morning walking up and down this beach and never got bored of it"
181,A calm and quiet less crowded beach,This is a great beach on soft white sand that stretches for miles. Its relatively clean and there's loads of empty space. Restaurants are strategically placed along the beach for those wanting to enjoy some seafood.
182,Beautiful Beach ,"Happen to visit this beach for first time and was really happy with the beach cleaning activity, water sports was missing as sea was rough."
183,Pristine beauty in the heart of South Goa,"Goa and Konkan area are full of beaches and hence in this sense there is nothing unique about this beach.But I was staying in Club Mahindra Varca and which makes this kind of a private beach! Hardly 15/20 people would be there on the beach and most of them are the people staying in the resort.This gives you all the peace, calm and space you crave for when you to any beach. Hence loved the beach experience here!"
184,Peaceful Beach,The beach us very clean. We went for boating. There is a restaurant with variety of items in the menu. We went for boating. We paid Rs 600 each for 30 mins drive. This is very costly. The boat person gave us ride only for 20 mins. A good place to spend and enjoy especially…
185,Amazingly clean beach,"The beach is clean and nice and the shore gradient is gentle, so it is safe even for non-swimmers to wade in. Water sports like Jet Ski and Para-sailing available. A few beach shacks are also available to enjoy food and drinks, but do not expect high quality of food preparation. Stray dogs are a bit of nuisance."
186,Varca Beach,"It's one of the cleanest beaches with white sand and a good beach, kind of a secluded beach not really crowded. Have 1 or 2 shacks ok types. Nearby located is Sterling, Zuri White Sands and Club Mahindra resorts."
187,Great stay,"I am a member for last 9 years at Varca Beach resort, Clubmahindra. A place in India for cleanness with miles of beach.  They have 3 restaurants to cover world wide food. Staff are pleasant and it has 2 swimming pool , Spa and a small grocery shop. I come here from Scotland to have holiday nealy every year."
188,More or less personal beach,This is one of best beach of Goa. It is clean and with soft and fine sand. It is less crowded than other North Goa beaches and hence may be the best place for families. A long streak of silky sand will make awesome photography during sunsets. Many resorts and hotels are nearby and you can walk down to have a look at beautiful sunset over Arabian sea enjoying playing and swimming inside safe and clean sea. A must visit if you happen to stay in South Goa.
189,Amazing sand quality and not crowded ,Varca beach is one of the more peaceful beaches in Goa. This beach in South Goa has soft white sand and is perfect for a long morning or evening walk.
190,Very Good Beach,"Varca beach is in south Goa, most of the crowd here is from the resorts located near this beach.  You will fine less Indian crowd here and most of people on this beach are foreigners. I visited this beach in month of November and one interesting thing I noticed about this beach…"
191,Isolated beach,"This beach was connected to our resort and was always cleaned by the resort staff,there are life guards on the beach and security of the resort keep an eye on the guest entering the water so it is safe."
192,Excellent Beach in South Goa,"great white sand,  no sellers, hawkers...just very nice, less crowded amazing beach...we entered the beach from the road which is next to the Zuri white sands compound wall...make right, just before Zuri's gate...."
193,Big Beautiful Broad Beach,"Lots of shacks, Boat rides, Clean Beach Access.Reasonable fares of food, beverages and Rides.Good for families!"
194,plz dont follow google map,"We had a wonderful opportunity to enjoy private beach facilities at Varca Beach as part of our stay @Majestic Beach Comfort. It was quiet and serene and we, a family of four adults and three children, could peacefully bathe in the sea while playing, swimming and enjoying all along. The silver sand was soothing to the eyes and the ambience was one to create a permanent impression on the mind!"
195, Beautifule,"The reason I say best is coz in my numerous trips to Goa beaches right from Baga, Calagute, Candolim, Mandrem , Vagator, Morjim in North Goa to Canacona, Agonda, Palolem beaches in South, Varca turns out to be the best clean and free of public. And there is a simple reason for it...it just doesn't have enough hotels and shacks !I am not quite sure whether it's due to low awareness , popularity of dearth of budget hotels but maybe because if these reasons it's a place to be..The sands white, the beach quite broad for u to play, run, chill , sleep etc.. few shacks (must say most are not that good in food taste but it's the beach for which you go there ) and it's a long one.So if you wanna really rejuvenate, dont wanna see many faces and be by yourself then go to Varca..Best part about this beach is it's just 45 mins from the airport unlike other South Goa beaches. So you don't waste too much time traveling like in the case of far north (Mandrem,Morjim, Arambol) or far south ( Canacona, Agonda, Palolem)TIP : if you want a good meal (lunch/dinner) and don't wanna compromise on taste or quality then you can walk across to a hotel called Sterling Varca. That's the best in food and absolute bliss. It's just 500 mtrs from the entrance of Varca beach or just behind Zuri white Sands hotel."
196,Very beautiful and very clean and safe beach,Only for couple or family who would like to spent good time sitting in a beach without any noise and disturbance..
197,Beautiful Serene white sand beach,"It’s a nice, clean and quiet beach in south Goa. We used the stretch behind Club Mahindra resort. It’s not crowded so us and the kids enjoyed a lot. The sunset was mesmerizing!"
198,Varca Beach Review.,A very nice beach - very very peaceful and very clean. Thoroughly enjoyable. Good for a long quiet walks.
199,Calm n cool,"Unlike other popular beaches in Goa like Bagha and Candolim, it is a secluded beach with not too many people. A clean and managed beach."
200,Simple beach with only 1 shack and no activities,The beach is clean and free of crowds.. You can enjoy with your family and loved ones..A few shack restaurants are also there to cater to your needs..
201,Neat and Clean,We stay on this beach for 2 weeks at the The Zuri White Sands Hotel.BRILLIANT stay so much nicer than North Goa  namely Candolim beach ( very busy dirty beach0Varca is an Unspoilt beach with a scattering of beach shacks with great food and drinks. - Very Cheap. All close to the main hotels. NOT CROWDED  no rush for sunbeds ( free at the Beach shacks - just by a drink now and again) Hardly any litter or pollution ( there are local beach cleaners picking up washed up plastic etc. BUT watch out for dog pooh - from a number of dogs who are close to the beach shacks and the occasional cow pats.!!! You can walk for miles and miles with a beautiful breeze and the sun shinning - Heaven
202,Nice beach ,"White sand , little crowd which was very nice. No hawkers to trouble you. Got a chance to see some fishermen pulling in their catch early morning. No beach shacks and a few stray dogs were the drawback.."
203,Lovely and Clean beach,"Fishermans wharf in south gia,gun powder,most highly recommended is fat fish in north gia-pooja ,the owner,there,makes sure personally to be around n make sure about everything.most recommended is solkadi and salted caramel icecream at fat fish.love goa"
204,Beautiful beach,"Soft Golden sand, clean water, no shells and plants from sea, shallow water. What else you need?Stay in Sterling Varca or Mahindra, eat in Garden Cafe restaurant."
205,Quite location ,"Beautiful beach. Though you would not see alot of people post 8pm whih is a dampener to the Goa spirits and people here would say "" We are not like North Goa, where beaches are open but its risky"". I was like guys 20 mins up in South Goa, Colva beach is open at night and safe and nice. A culture issue mostly"
206,"Beaches..Beaches..Beaches, They take your heart away",The beach has very less crowd and hence can be enjoyed with family. No market nearby just one supermarket. A few restaurants are available.A very clean beach to enjoy sunset.
207,Pristine bwach,"A good, clean shallow beach in south Goa. Has guards who keeps warning people who venture out far into the seas. This is a simple beach and does not have any restaurant attached to it. So pl carry food and water if you intend to spend a lot of time. There are also few sales agents distributing coupons of a neighbouring resort (it’s not Club Mahindra-it’s a different one and can’t remember the name). Pl do not participate in the event as there are stories of harassment."
208,Long and peaceful,Lovely and abeautiful beach. It was very neat and clean.  A lot of activities taking place.  Nixmce eating joints available.  Sun rise and sun set were amazing sights.
209,Beautiful Serene beach,The beach is a very clean and quiet beach with small local restaurants at the beach. We had Lunch at Mama´s kitchen and we loved the seafood there. IF you want to have more action you should go to Palolem beach etc.
210,Wonderful Beach,"Great stay good hospitality. Staff was good, amenities we're good and satisfying.Sohail in the house keeping was outstanding.Liked my stay overall"
211,Finest 🌇Sunset It was 👌👌👌👌,"Uncrowded, easily accessible with safe parking options. Clean, unpolluted stretched with lifeguard. Need to check rules regarding going out some distance into the sea to swim - fussy supervisors keep whistling you back. Maybe need to assure them you can swim if you want to venture out. Speedboat rides available."
212,Neat and clean,"Located at 900 meters from our hotel, the beach was at walking distance. Visited the beach at couple of times during our stay at different times. The beach is quite clean and well maintained. However there are no shacks or anything which makes Goa beaches more fun."
213,Very clean ,"The beach is good if u crave for silence, otherwise varca is a tepid beach with a single shack that has horrible tea and worser food. It suit us best as there was solitude and no disturbance. Otherwise the famous goa spirit is not felt here,better opt for other beaches"
214,Ideal for the introspective morning walk...),"The south part of the Indian coast is not so populated with tourists. It is cleaned every day, there are shakes (cafes) on the beach to eat. As a minus I consider the currents along the beach."
215,Less crowded beach,"We stayed at Club Mahindra, which is bang on the Varca Beach only. You have to walk just 300 meters from your resort and you are on the beach!The sand on the beach is powder and very soft. The beach is very clean and only a few tourists or locals you can see playing or walking.It is dotted only by one or two shacks who provide the bench, ☂️ and the food, of you need.Water is very clean and temperature is good to take a swim in the sea and enjoy!Overall, it's exotic experience."
216,Clean & Peaceful Beach,"A nice, relaxing and quiet beach. You can 'rent' a sunbed if you just buy a drink at one of the cafes and use it for the day. Nice water too and the beach is clean."
217,Varca Beach !! ,One of the best beaches in Goa  and it’s located in the Southern Part of Goa close to Benaulim.Lots of beach resorts are nearby and its really awesome if you are a couple or going with family Hardly any shacks or food available here Take a 2 wheeler and snacks with you Keep the beach clean as it is Overall - 5 stars
218,Clean and beautiful,"Varca Beach is one of the best kept beaches in South Goa. We stayed at Club Mahindra that has a private area in Varca Beach - it is clean, with hardly any crowd and you can spend hours on the beachside !"
219,Nice and Calm beach,"I travelled with my family. The beach was clean, not very crowded. The sunset was spectacular. Will visit again soon."
220,Family time at the sea,"The best beach of Goa, if only the stray dogs were not there. The administration is doing nothing to contain their numbers, they are a menace on this beach. My son was chased badly and it was a nightmare of an experience on the otherwise beautiful beach."
221,Conference,we went in Monsoon and stayed at the resort on the beach. so the sea was rough. But beach is nice..long strip to walk. Many resorts on the strip. few outside visitors.
222,Nice shallow beach,So glad I came here - so different from the commercial North Goa. If you want hustle and bustle this is NOT the place for you - but if you want long quiet walks on an almost deserted beach - this is heaven!!
223,Clean and peaceful beach,an amazing beach without any crowd. if you are staying in sterling  then it is only a few steps away. You will find Zuri casino nearby where entry and boozes are all free...
224,"Very clean, calm and shallow beach",Shame there are so many dogs about. They are not a threat but leave there calling marks. Lovely walks and birds about including Brahminy Kites.
225,Holidays,A remarkably clean beach away from the bustling crowdsExtremely beautiful n cleanA must visit to avoid the crowd @ Colva if u r in South Goa
226,Overall the place is serene.,"Closer to our hotel, this is a nice beach, less populated. The hotel has a private entrance to the beach"
227,"We visited several beaches in GOA. This the CLEAN, COOL, NO CROWDY BEACH.","Beach is beautiful, not crowded. Water is really warm. The evenings are better since the tide is higher. The mornings are a good time to do beach combing  - can find star fish, anemones etc washed out.  Some of the water sports activities are also available here."
228,Absolute clean beach,"The long stretch of beach out side the caravella never gets crowded, it has life guards on duty and is the perfect place to relax."
229,Clean and away from crowd,Beach is clear mostly couples you can find foreigners can also use the beach. You can get some little food also for breakfast sometimes
230,No Way to enter the public beach,I have been to a number of beaches in India and abroad however this has to be the best i have seen till date. I stayed in the Zuri White Sands and this was our private beach. The best part was that there was not a single garbage on the beach. It was super clean which added to the beauty.
231,"Clean, white sands","Had wonderful experiences with Sunset yoga, Sunrise yoga and riding a bike with the Sunset, walks..."
232,Good beach for privacy,Excellent beach for peace loving....Good place to sea  mediation ...Sea is calm... Black stone   impression
233,Nice place to spend evening,"Of all the beaches we have been in Goa, this is one of the cleanest. Was less crowded and we have very peaceful walks."
234,Great beach but difficult to approach,"This beach just goes on for miles and miles. It is the perfect holiday beach,  just sand, sand and more sand. It's perfect for walking,  jogging and just sunbathing. There are various beach shacks all along where you can get wonderful local food and refreshments and most provide sunbeds too. If you are up early enough you can watch the local fishermen land their boats with the daily catch. The perfect end to the day is being on the beach to watch the most glorious sunset."
235,Calm and serene!,"As we were very near to the beach, we could enjoy the beach, the sunset, the waves and meditation on the beach. All this was possible because of the beach not being so crowded. It is better to have more water sports here as the couple of them are too expensive as compared to Colva and other beaches."
236,Clean beach with white sand and transparent water,Superb Service from all the staff right from to gaurd ...cart driver to check Vikram..also  house keeping staff was very very helpful.. special mention if Barkat Ali.. Exceptionally Outstanding ..right from Smooth check-in and guiding the staff and Our Children... Really an asset to Club Mahindra
237,Lovely memories,"We like this hotel and the people of the hotel likely mention some bar staff mr.Dev,chandan,Stephen,gautam,Ganga,mr.nizam,rohit kamat, and worm welcome by front office staff like mr.mitesh and defney they guided us regarding the property and nice design of the hotel with different outlet .."
238,"Serene, Clean and Mesmerizing","I visited Goa in mid of February and stayed in Sterling Goa Varca with my friends and their family. The stay was really comfortable and relaxing. The cleanliness was up to the mark. They have very good staff. Mr. Suvenkar was really helpful to us. Even the other staff members were taking care of our comfortable stay. They entertained our kids, became our cameraman when we were in swimming pool, took care of our food preferences in dining area. We  enjoyed their holiday activities like Dance, Family Games, magic show and many more. They have good indoor and outdoor games where our children were engaged.  They have kids play area, indoor games as well as outdoor games. The ladies preferred going to their spa. It was also nice. The food was amazingly delicious. It was less spicy yet tasty. One can customize the spice level as per their taste. The resort surrounding was beautiful. There were coconut trees all around. The Varca beach was very nearby. It was clean and isolated that gives you the feeling of private beach. Although I also have a suggestion for the owners. There is a need of washbasin near dining area. The existing one is quite far away. The stay in Sterling Goa Varca was amazing and memorable."
239,Leisure trip with senior citizens. Calm and quiet. But if you want a happening place then North Goa is the best.,It's a nice beach tucked away far from the crowd... May feel little desolate after sunset.. Clear water and a peaceful place.
240,The best beach in India,Clean and Tidy beach... White Sand... And the ocean is the same everywhere.Not much Shacks though... But the one there is... Amazing Spring Rolls
241,Relaxing beach,The resort is amazing. The food is fabulous.The beach is fantasticThe pool is goodThe stay was comfortableHappy Hub is great. Chandni In the Happy Hub is nice we met In the Happy Hub
242,Club Mahindra,We stayed at the Sterling Resorts Varca hoping to use this beach for our recreation. There was a very narrow entrance to the public beach which was completely flooded with drain water.
243,Calm and Serene,"Great beach.. very clean, calm and beautiful... water sports are also available... there is no night life on this beach..."
244,Cleanest White Sand Beach In Goa. Loved it!,"Varca beach is one of the less crowded one even compared with Colva beach which is only about 10 km from Varca. You can hire beach-chairs which are mostly placed under beach-umbrellas and charged at hourly rates by the beach side restaurants/shacks. They also serve you cold Beer, drinks, food & snacks."
245,Serene and calm,It's a lovely clean beach. The waves are relentless so it's a lot of fun to be in the water. Just don't venture in a lot cause the undercurrent is really strong. Can't say if there are any shacks around here cause I went during the monsoons when shacks are closed at most beaches.
246,Very nice and serene beach,We had followed google map and reached at the back gate of club mahindra resort  which they wont open for outsiders . Im not sure whtr there is any other route to reach the beach .
247,Verca Beach,"We had a great time at the beach at it was adjacent to our resort. Being the rainy season, the seas were a bit rough but the breeze and the lack of crowds made it a serene experience."
248,Excellent ,"My family stay at  Club Mahindra Varca Beach Goa from 02 to 04 Feb was a great experience. The resort has its own beach and plethora of Adventure Activities. It ha two swimming pools to cater for its guests in 250 odd rooms. The hospitality, catering and housekeeping are all flawless."
249,A cool shot with cool water,"It's a good beach for a swim, not as calm as Palolem and not as aggressive as Agonda. I saw a couple of dead jellyfish at the shore, but did not find any issue during any of my swims.Also make sure you go there after November, becuase before that they have red flags everyone and lifeguards who would interrupt whenever you go beyond your knees inside water."
250,"Clean , serene ..","This beach is also called as Diamond beach, because of its shininess especially during evening time when sun is about to set. It's clean and peaceful :)"
251,Excellent ,I am club Mahendra Member since last 7 years.This is our second visit to Varca - Club Mahendra.One of my favourite place.Its wonderful place.Ambiance is Excellent.with lots of Green Plants& Trees.The Rooms are excellent.Lots of Activities are there in club compound.Two good size swimming pools-with facilities of swimming for kids also.Restaurant serves mouth watering breakfasts& meals with high Tea.Worth trying.Staff at Resorts are all cordial& helping nature. Class facilities is excellent for senior citizen like Us.Along with buggy car to pixked& Seppedto Room.Club Mahendra has got their own Pvt. sea  Entry.It has. It own taxi service for clients to & from Airport.(with charge of course. Really Immpressive club.
252,White sand beach,"Refreshing and revitalising. Walking on the beach amidst limitless sky, bonding with family and breathing in fresh air was so mesmerising. Soulful!!!"
253,hppy to be here,Kids used to spend major part of the day here without caring to eat or rest. Could gaze at all beautiful phases of the sea & the sky.
254,Untouched Beach,"Once again, I took a break and went with family to Club Mahindra Varca Resort from 7th to 11th October, 18.  I'm very regular with this property- Club Mahindra Varca and the way they attend through their staff is incredible. Exceptional service of the staff is its greatest USP. They were quite adept at discharging their duties.Indeed great to observe and feel, despite having large occupancies thought out the year, this property is “Well Maintained”. Presence of Good Housekeeping and Engineering Services reflect in Guest areas and can feel during the stay. Despite so many years of operations, ‘Factor of Fatigue’ is Not Visible. The rooms/suites are well equipped and tastefully adorned also with all basic necessities good decor and peaceful views from all rooms/suites, surrounded by greenery and water bodies. The property is expansive with a fairly large space allocated to Pools and spa. Activities were engaging and we felt that there is sufficient to feel absorbed during the day. Food is Good,.. Local Food is TOO Good. Local food as also a part of their menu in the Restaurant - is a great idea….Overall the place is serene. This Resort is a great place of vacation, rather it serves as a destination for family and friends to stay and enjoy together."
255,nature at its best,A early morning or a late evening jog ( in the monsoon season) at the Varca beach is what I enjoyed best. You will have the beach to yourself if you go very early in the morning for a run and take in the fresh air.  The white sandy beach is very clean and views will take your breath away. The experience will stay with you for a lifetime.
256,Varca beach,I was surprised to see such a clean beach. My wife and I were staying in Zuri and had access to this beach. Since we visited in monsoon there were no shacks open. But still was good to walk there.
257,Peaceful Beach,I did a swim 200 meters from the shore from Varca to Benaulim on 10th Feb 2019 starting at 3.30pm to 5:10pm. It was simply awesome 3.4 km swim. The water is a little salty so if you guys are into long swims you do get a little dehydrated. But the experience is very good.
258,Clean and well manned beach,"This is a most wonderful location where the accommodation is excellent,  the food great and the staff could not be more accommodating. The only criticism is that WiFi is only available in the lobby and not across the whole site which,  in this day and age,  should be so."
259,Extremely clean and private beach,"This may be because I visited in the month of September. The beach was so clean , water was clean and it was serene. There were no restaurants setup on the beach. It is not very easy to get to the beach and takes a little walk."
260,Good,Stayed at Caravella Beach Resort and walked from Varca Beach down to Cavelossim on a couple of days.  The beach at Varca is very quiet and clean.  Lovely !  Would definitely recommend
261,"Calm, Clean and Quiet","Club Mahindra, Palm Emerlad to VERCA beach is 800 mtrs. In the morning and evening short distance to walk to beach. Delfinetly enjoy the people related to other beaches."
262,My views,I stayed at a resort right on the beach.  The water was extremely clean and so was the sand itself.  It had some waves but nothing to rough
263,Nice clean beach,White sand !!! High tides and low tides Clean beach . During low tide the water recedes far into the sea and give you feeling of walking into flat land with a thin layer of foamy water on your feet. Amazing calmness
264,Pretty beach with white sands..,"My family loved this beach. We stayed in Varca for a week and really enjoyed the beach. It is very clean, and not busy at all. There aren’t as many beach chairs and food shacks as other, busier beaches, but enough to get by. We mostly just set up in the sand and enjoyed the waves for hours."
265,Quiet and Enjoyable Beach,I really loved that beautiful beach journey and a cool shot with our crazy groupmate I would like to experience such beautiful rides again and also recommend it
266,Clean beach ,"It is pristine...away from the hustle bustle of crowd...The rare garbage free beach in India...I went from North to South Goa, but this was the best."
267,One of the best beaches of South Goa,My first time here. Not as busy as the north area around Candolim or Baga. Sea calmer too. Lifeguards patrol the beach and warning flags are posted too. The beach very clean but quite a few stray dogs though. Decent amount of shacks and sun beds.
268,One of the most cleaner beaches,Hospitality is key of this hotel which make it different from any other 5star hotel. Apart from all facilities available are best including awesome breakfast
269,familiy vacation,"Varca BeachVarcaFab, clean beach644344500The beach at Varca was very beautiful, clean and quiet. The beach restaurants all offered great food and service and you must stop at Evisha's and have a sundowner. The beaches are similar up and down this stretch of coast and we cycled north to Benaulim and south to Cavelossim and all the beaches were pretty much the same, some more crowded than others but all had clean, white sand and plenty of restaurants and bars. One downside is that it is quite difficult to swim if there is a swell, but the Lifeguards will always advise if asked. There are lots of dogs on Varca beach and I can assure you they are harmless. An English lady called Sandra runs a charity which serves to get all the dogs vaccinated and sterilised to ensure they remain healthy and numbers are controlled. Her charity is ensures all dogs are vaccinated against mange, parasites, worms and rabies. The dogs are also sterilised in order to control the population and the charity feeds them 365 days a year. 100% of your donation goes to this great cause if you choose to give."
270,Fabulous beach,"Our hotel, The Caravela Beach Resort, had direct access to this beautiful beach, with a beach bar. We loved the beach and the sea. The currents can be strong, but there were always life guards on the beach with warning flags, so we felt safe."
271,Club Mahindra Beach,"Having had trysts with North Goan beaches during most past visits, choosing South Goa this time was purposeful, and are we glad we did! Varca beach is a sight to behold... white, soft sands leading to a relatively calm see that allows you to swim into the moderately sized waves, and lined with just enough number of shaded beach-beds, you can spend hours here without a thought. The Caravela resort offers two shacks providing interesting cocktails and fresh sea-food, which adds to the charm. Water-sport options are available - although without the hassle of people forcing you to go parasailing or jet-skiing. You are free from the nagging tattoo makers, masseurs and hawkers trying to see you anklets & beads - multiple beaches will offer you these, in case you were interested - but Varca isn't one of them. If you're looking to simply chill out, and while-away your time while watching the sea and sipping on exotic cocktails, Varca is the place to be!"
272,Great beach,"Less than a KM away from the Resort.Empty road leading to the beach. Hardly any traffic. Very very hot, we went to the beach about 11.00 am. Profusely sweating. No trees to give shade. Nice plants (wild) along the way. Saw a huge green cactus plant, a few lotus floating, The beach was empty naturally we were there at a wrong time. Too hot,"
273,Vacation,"Miles of white sand , the sea is rough and the red flags were flying all the time . There are some great beach shacks with good food and drink . Lots of beach dogs so lots of dog mess so tread carefully  .nice to look at but too hot to sun bathe"
274,Varca Beach,We had an amazing holiday. Room service lead by Swati Das was beyond expectation. Buffet spreads catered for all tastes.Mr Menino & his staff very exceptionally courteous.Zubair Mir & Prasanta deserve special mention for their exuberance.
275,Beautiful,"Avoid Para sailing at the beach, the guiders behind the parasailer have to kick, also there are no hooks just knots.  Not worth the risk.  Beach is clean and quiet.  Few people around and no rowdies around.  Flags to guide swimming and alert Lifeguards are a plus point."
276,Paradise on earth - cleanest beach,"We went early for the sunset, took a walk, sea bathing, on the beach and then found a place to relax and watch the sunset.Very less crowded and lovely and quiet beach!"
277,Clean Beach,"Good to spend some time and relax. It's a walking distance from the Regenta Resort Hotel. Take some water with you, just in case."
278,Beach is Clean,They have all water sports but are heavily priced.Also the equipments are not mentained property they were in very poor condition.
279,Great beach with Hard sand,My room number is 20004.He fullfill our duty very good but overall my experience is not good.beacuse another staff is not  good. spa is very very bad experience .
280,Good and clean beach,"We were staying in Margao and it was our first time together in Goa. I was looking at the goa beaches online. We had already been to Palolem and then we were advised by the hotel staff that we should go to Varca beach. We went there and it was an amazing experience. We could have never imagined that we would find a stretch of marvelous white sand covering seashore and the glittering blue waves hugging the coast all to ourselves. The feeling was magical, we really enjoyed a lazy beach day there. There are only  2-3 shacks on the beach and is not crowded. We saw no more than 20 people on the beach. The beach is not commercialized so it’s a perfect place to enjoy each others company. We headed back right after sunset and not sure if shacks are open at night. There are many good accommodations around verca beach i.e. Club Mahindra Varca Beach Resort, Bissmark hotel, Zuri white sands etc. Benaulim Beach, Fatrade Beach, Margaon city and Colva Beach are some of its popular attractions nearby. At night Tangerine, sunset bar, sol bar, and blue lagoon are some of the places where you can enjoy a dance, music and great food."
281,Neat and Clean Beach,"Very bad experience, resort has permitted activity of Nissan kicks and there was a flow of 300- 400 people allowed in the common area, very unprofessional."
282,Quite and serene beach,"We stayed at club Mahindra varca for 4 days with our 2 girls aged 10 and 4,varca beach is beautiful,less crowded,good for swimming,white sand,some water sport activities,u can enjoy a peaceful sunset"
283,Clean & Pristine beach,"Perfect for all..my kids just loved the beach.Until the lifeguard blows the whistle ie at sunset,we are there in the waters!!!The sunrise and the sunset are blissful!!You will never get tired or bored of this place,we stayed for 8days & each new day the beach was more beautiful than before ;-)"
284,A clean pristine beach,"If you want to spend some time enjoying nature...do visit varca beach...it’s neat, quiet and serene...no disturbance and looks like a private beach. Enjoy the sunrise and sunset both and you will not regret"
285,Cleanest Beach,As someone famous says - ‘One Word - Three symbols - FAB-U-LOUS’ !!Special shout out to Pool & Beach Attendants Sigmond and Arun - just two of the staff that went over and above to make our third stay at this amazing Hotel incredible
286,My favourite beach in Goa,Also wanna visit Richard for a beautoful stay we had atthe reosrt.♥️Amazing Amazing Amazing!!! I have updated the frst revoew this one as well as it really slipped from my mind to add his name here.An important part of our few days journey and an amazing time😘😍
287,"Beautiful Beach. Neat and clean, less crowded","this was the fourth time I visited this hotel and I must say overall this was the best time every. The staff and the food were absolutely great. The standards in the room are in my meaning not like a 5 star room should be, especially not the bathrooms. There are dirth in the corners here and there but it is India. For me its too cold in side the bar and restaurants because of the aircondition. The staff and management are very nice and friendly and and wanna say a speciall thanks to my friends Ubhay Singh,  Pun Magar Chet Ram and Alroy. And of course all the guys and girls at the Zuri. Last but not least, my dear friend - Beach Guard!"
288,Good Beach,"As a beach Varca is similar to Utorda and also has a distant hill on its southern side, which looks picturesque. To me it’s the cleanest beach after Utorda, with soft white sand. The uniqueness about Varca is its casurina trees along the shoreline, instead of the usual coconut trees, which gives varca a distinct look. Lot of high end hotels with direct beach access is present in Varca, so another ideal place for peace loving tourists. The locality around Varca is extremely picturesque with picture perfect bungalows situated amidst huge courtyards. This November I visited South Goa beaches from Arossim to Palolem. For the trip report search google with ramblersnaps + South Goa"
289,Beautiful and clean beach,"Goa is surrounded by some of the most beautiful beaches, not only in India but perhaps the World. Some of these beaches are very crowded and some are not (especially during the peak/tourist season).Varca beach is one of the less crowded one even compared with Colva beach which is only about 10 km from Varca. If you are looking for a quiet beach with nice ambience to relax in Goa, then Varca beach is one of them. There is less activity here like Jet skiing, Para sailing etc. which is more evident in neighbouring Colva beach and other beaches, so there are less number of tourists/visitors here. For this reason perhaps there are less number of beach-side-food/drinks shacks & restaurants here too (compared to Colva and other beaches). You can hire beach-chairs which are mostly placed under beach-umbrellas and charged at hourly rates by the beach side restaurants/shacks. They also serve you cold Beer, drinks, food & snacks. (Some will offer you better rates/deal if you agree to also buy food, drinks from them -- it's negotiable).  Varca town itself which is about 3 km from the beach (and about 28 km from Dabolim international Airport) is quite a relaxed place to stay in Goa. It has many multi-cuisine restaurants/eateries, convenience stores, Souvenirs shops etc. From Varca you can organise day trips to many places of interest in Goa.Malay AdhikariMelbourne, Australia)"
290,Peaceful and clean,"The Varca beach is one of the beaches in the southern part of the state, away from the hustle and bustle of the beaches of the north. This is the place to go if you want to enjoy a peacefull walk in the sands with your partner, catch a breathtaking sunset, and build sand castles with your kids without being afraid that the crowd will crush it even before it is built.There are multiple resorts along the stretch mostly having their private entrance."
291,Nice clean beach,"Service was very good , especially mr sairaj service was goodWould like to visit again and againWould advice all our friends"
292,S TEJASWINI,Played football with random folks. Two of them were beach guards and some were restaurant staff in vicinity and some other random folks.
293,Beautiful Beach,"We were staying in a nearby property, we went to spend time there on a Sunday evening but were surprised to see that many buses were parked there beach was full of people and they were eating food on the beach side and littering all over the place. very disappointing"
294,CLEAN BEACH,"Not to much people, and not to much salesmen. Great waves, but strong streams... it’s neccesary to know howe to swim."
295,"Same as other beaches in Goa but kind of Private, hence best rating","Being very close to where we stayed, we would often walk down the distance, at least, twice everyday. My very first encounter with the beach ensured its place in my list of favourites. The white sands creating a strange creaking sound under the feet deserve mention together with the never-ending stretch of the beach which tempts one for long walks. The beach, rather surprisingly, is never very crowded and therefore, make sea-bathing a great fun.By the way, presence of lifeguards at strategic points is quite reassuring."
296,Pleasure trip,White sand beach....neat and clean.... crystal clear water..... shallow beach for bathing and sweeming lovers....
297,Clean white sand beach,Wonderful stay ...everything was just perfect... Beach at a walking distance.... Rooms extremely well maintained... Linen clean.... Kitchen with ample cooking facility.... Automatic washing machine.... Lovely morning sunshine..... Clean swimming pool
298,Amazing Beach ,"I went at verca beach in the night at around 7:30 pm and then the next morning at 11 am . Beach is beautifully, there were no shacks but it was a beaury. One of the best beaches in Goa .!!"
299,A paradise,"Every day an army of cleaners clear this beautiful beach of rubbish - and there's often quite a bit. The sand is white and the beaches long. There are a number of shacks offering food, drink and amenities such as water sport equipment etc. Watching the tide come in or the sun setting on the horizon is a magical experience."
