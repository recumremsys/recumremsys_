0,Fascinating Local History Artifacts,We came across this gem purely by chance - having no plans on a lazy afternoon..  The museum is housed in an architecturally classic building of three floors wherein all the rooms and even the hallways are replete with numerous artifacts ranging from masks to ancient armaments.  A must see!!  …
1,Visiting for new memory making,I discovered that museum yesterday and I spent a couple of hours there. It is a private Art collection dedicated to the South of India. It is what I call eclectic and an old type of Museology. I mean by that an incredible diverse collection but to many things in such a small…
2,Must-see gem in Kerala.,"This place is recommended by a taxi driver, and we felt disappointed. It’s just a massive collection, not organized at all, you can even feel like you’re visiting his warehouse. And the ticket is 200 per person, it’s not worthy."
3,"Awesome collection, must see","This was not on our itinery but gratitude to our driver for suggesting it after a disappointing trek to the government controlled, dilapidated Hill Palace and Dutch museum earlier. We were overwhelmed with the collection of artifacts and hats off to the passion of this family…"
4,Fantastic collection of ancient artifacts,It was a good place to start if you’re looking at local artefacts & history...the place is generally well taken of & informative. The washrooms are less desired but then it was a holiday when we went (more people than usual). A must see!!
5,Very Interesting and definitely worth a trip,This museum was visited by Charles and Camilla apparently and i can see why it would have been on their itinerary. Stuffed full of interesting artefacts and wonderful ceilings. Lots of religious items.
6,A perfect insight to the Keralan way of life,We visited the museum on 22/10/17.  The museum building itself has the antique feel and is appropriate for the display of such artefacts. The display is mostly related to culture of kerela in the earlier centuries. But it is worth the visit though entry charge is Rs 100/- per…
7,A Museum of Passion,"This is well worth your support as this museum was born from the passion of a private collector with a love of local culture. We allowed a couple of hours and were held fascinated by the immense, diverse and comprehensive collection of art and artefacts of all ages and from all…"
8,Historical background knowledge,"They have a good collection . But not placed in very interactive or interesting way . I expected more from here. I would have preferred they have a lift , walkie talkie to explain or small movie as introduction to know more about the musuem. With my kid she was bored , usually…"
9,Nothing too magnificent and probably a bit overhyped,We went there as it was part of our trip itinerary. It is recommended only for those who have keen interest in historical art collection 20000+ art effects collected by a private collector. Good collection of sarees to but from on reasonable price.
10,A must see ,Not mentioned by our tour company it was by chance our driver took us here to while away some time on our last day before travelling to the airport.   What a treasure!  Artefacts from all cultures crammed in together - it would have been possible to spend hours here.  Also there…
11,Best  Folklore Museum,"Although it was a fairly good collection of items on three floors of the building , our experience was totally ruined by the dark fat lady at the counter who was rude and behaved as if the museum belonged to her.   Otherwise , there are a lot of items belonging to the last few…"
12,The Best Event of our visit,We went to this museum as it was a must see in Lonely Planet.  They were absolutely correct.  There were treasures everywhere and one was more beautiful than the next.  It is easy to get their from Fort Kochi.  It was well worth the trip on the ferry
13,"Museum with potential, problem with crowd control","The artifacts on display is simply great. Was told that one person has collected all these huge number of artifacts, displayed in three stories of the building. The guide explained in detail about each artifact. Must visit if interested in history of the South India."
14,A great place to visit for people who love art & history in one,"We very much enjoyed our visit to the Kerala Folklore Museum, although it is a museum unlike any other, full of eclectic items from Kerala’s history. There was so much to look at and it was arranged in a very interesting style, and the guides were very helpful, definitely worth…"
15,Too much in one place,"I just checked in a Sunday noon to have an insight and explore the exhibits in the Kerala Folklore musem, own and managed by a private curator the building architecture itself is so authentic traditional with intricate details of the Kerala Architecture. The exhibits of antiques…"
16,Crammed with items collected by one family,This was not on our itinerary but we were delighted our driver suggested stopping. A huge private collection very well displayed and interesting in a fascinating building with amazing woodwork. Strongly recommend a visit
17,Brilliant history collection ,"We, a spanish family, were in this wonderful museum some days ago and was an astonishing experience due to the huge number of items in display (also the house is wonderful). We were very lucky because we met the widow and the son of Mr. George who took their time to explain the…"
18,Its all about history,temple.   Our day trip in Kochi took us to the Kerala Folklore Museum . To our astonishment we found over a thousand years of culture preserved so perfectly in midst of the city. We were enchanted  by the collections in this three storied building and were ushered by…
19,Packed with amazing artefacts,This is a private museum. Hats of to the founder of this place. So much of history in one place. Government should help generously to preserve this beautiful museum.We really like place. Entry fee is on the higher side. The place can be made affordable to general public with the…
20,Amazing collection,"I visited this museum around lunchtime on a Sunday and it was quiet. It was 300INR to enter including the use of cameras. This translates to about £3 so it was a bargain! The museum was absolutely packed of fascinating history! The staff were incredibly helpful, very kind and…"
21,A hidden treasure ,A local person recommend this museum to me. It is full of artefacts which were collected over many years by one person.  It cost 200 rupees plus a ticket for taking photos. Well worth a visit. Please note as usual you have to leave your shoes outside. There are also 3 flights of…
22,A must visit!,"This is a must visit for anyone interested in history, culture.  Nothing about the kings and rulers of this region, but an amazing display of people's way of life, their rich culture and colours in Kerala, Being a diverse cultural state, Kerala has many things of interest and…"
23,Culture ,"This is an interesting museum..which kids n elders both would enjoy. Not very big but its maintained well and gives a glimpse on the history...There are 3 floors in all. There are stores inside selling imitation jewellery, sarees and artefacts."
24,Small and Beautiful ,Situated right next to our hotel we spent two lovely hour browsing through the museum. So much to see what an amazing collection. The staff where helpful and informative. A delightful stroll in the history of Indian artefacts and other eclectic stuff. The building is also fabulous.
25,Had one of the best time here,Been here during the noon time. Must visit if you are interested in knowing historical artefacts of south india. 3 floors. Wooden steps. Takes about 45mins for total tour. 100 rs entry fee. Visit this place if you stay at kochi for 1 day.
26,Great visit to Kerala museum,"I'm often highly suspicious of so-called folklore museums as they often comprise a collection of miscellaneous junk .... not so with the Kerala Folklore Museum (which was not on our visit programme), and which fascinated and delighted us.  Generally well laid out over several…"
27,Kerala Folklore Museum - Glimpses of Kerala Architectural Styles.,This museum is fascinating and beautiful - a must-see while in Kochi. I could have taken hours here happily. 
28,A great informative visit,"We'd had the folklore museum recommended during our stay in Kochi - it's outside Fort Kochi if you stay there but well worth a visit. 20,000 items on display over three floors, organised by different areas of Kerala and even the room furnishings are exhibits including a 63 tonne…"
29,Excellent.  One man's collection shown over 4 floors ,I have been to multiple museums the world over.. and always felt we could do so much more in India... After seeing the really well curated collection at the folklore museum... I should say it would really grow to be a great museum showcasing the best of Kerala and India.  Really…
30,A must see!,If you are looking for history of kerala and south india then this is a place for you. This privately owned museum is well built and organised and has vast number of historical items which define the culture and history of kerala and south India.
31,A Little Hidden Gem,The place has a very big collection...  But it is just dumped in a very small place.  The entry per person is 100 but there is no air conditioning or fans in the ground floor rooms...  Difficult to breathe also in the hot weather of kochi.  If you have small kids the place can…
32,Terrible & Pathetic Museum.,We started our visit to Kerala at the museum and it introduced us to the culture of the South.A guide took us round and she was very informative and helpful.For a first overview of the Country it is worth a visit has it explains a lot of other things you will encounter during…
33,Lot of artifacts,This is one of the most incredible places we have ever been- it is a vast collection of Indian artifacts collected by a single private collector who has unselfishly built this museum so that the general public can benefit. It is run largely by his beautiful family and the entry…
34,A good museum with 10 to 20th century artefacts,"I appreciate the effort put to collect and preserve the artifacts/antiques, indeed they have a good collections. This place needs good support from people and government.  Thanks Ramesh KJ"
35,awesome collection!!,"This is a great place - a sanctuary away from the bustling streets of Kochi.  A really interesting collection of artefacts from many ages (11th century to the present day) fro, I believe, a local collector (and only opened in 2009).  What I liked about it was the intimacy of…"
36,Beautiful museum ,Very interesting for both architectural style of the building itself and the various collections inside.  I look forward to going there again.
37,Lots and lots of exhibits,"The museum is packed with so much to see. U will only find a small path cleared to walk through. It was mix of ancient and few mid times antiques for us to see. Based on crafts & Folk art, there is a variety of artifacts to get mesmerized. The architecture of this authentic Kerala style building keeps it in flavour. The building itself speaks on realistic wooden carpentry of Kerala. A must visit spot learn about the various ancient art forms of Kerala."
38,A treasure trove of antiques,"Was not overly impressed with most of the museums we saw in Kochi, but this was a pleasant exception.  The building was jam packed with artifacts that brought much of the history and culture we heard about to life.  The first floor hostess did a marvelous job explaining the…"
39,Interesting museum / antiques shop,"Three floors, packed with artifacts from southern India, in a beautiful building.  We spent about an hour here and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is true that the objects do not have detailed explanations, but they are beautiful to look at, and most of the objects have dates and…"
40,Really good,It was probably the most interesting and informative place I visited in Cochin. I went discovering the past centuries of art and folk history! A private effort of Annie and George Thaliath! Great venture to restore antiques and recreate the past.  I bought almost all my…
41,Beautiful compact place !,"Great museum , and given a lovely guided tour ... great place to visit ... caught the ferry from Fort Kochi to Ernakulam "
42,gateway to folklore,"Considering that the Museum's collection is private, my family was astounded by its breadth and depth. It feels like a large museum has been packed with considerable forethought toward display and design into a temple. I can not help but feel that I could have easily spent…"
43,Visit to the Kerala Folklore Museum,"This was the most overwhelming collection of South Indian artifacts we had seen up to this point of our three week trip. The building itself is quite something, with multiple floors and fun to explore. There is a lot to see without much context or available information on…"
44,Worth a visit!,"Though there are amazing Articrafts displayed here, it is basicaly what looks like a private collection. Our driver took us to this place as one of the attractions in Kochi. Entry fees was Rs 100 plus Rs 100 if one wants to take photographs, just a bit too much though It certainly has an impressive collection of artifacts by a private collectorKerala Folklore Museum has various antiques that showcase the history, tradition and culture. There are costumes of dance forms like Mohiniattam and Theyyam, antique properties,Old writings instruments, antique chairs etc.This museum houses a priceless collection of artefacts and covers three architectural styles: Malabar, Kochi/Portuguese and Travancore across three floors.Ground,1st & 2nd)"
45,3 floors of ancient Indian artifacts,Very welcoming and helpful staff. This place is stuffed to capacity with ancient artifacts. Well worth a visit.
46,saw much but didn’t learn much,While we were enjoying the sounds and sights in Kochi in December our driver had suggested three times that we should visit the Kerala Folklore Museum in Kochi. My wife and I were not too interested as first the name wasn’t too impressive and we wanted to see so many other “more…
47,Great collection but uninterested staff,A wonderful display of antiques and cultural heritage made a reality by the dedicated attention of the Thaliath family.  Several knowledgeable staff answered our questions. A creative display which can easily occupy more space and sustained interest of the visitor as the…
48,Amazing,Very interesting place with historic items and intelligent informative staff. My wife did purchase a couple of items to help the life of the museum.
49,A Must See!,Our driver took us here and suggested we visit. This was during our Citrus Holidays tour of Kerala. No other driver took any of the other couples we met doing the same tour here although some passed it and saw the signage. This was quite surprising as it was actaully interesting…
50,A musa to see,Awestruck that this person took such effort to build up this museum. It's very rich in cultural artefacts in my view it's a must visit.
51,Amazing museum,"It as not a planned visit, kind of popped in to check what it is about. Was delighted to see the Artifacts collection here. Happened to speak to one of the partners of this place-Mrs George if I am not mistaken, she explained their 30 years journey of collating these Antique…"
52,A must to see the Kerala Folklore Museum while in Kochi.,"it was a wonderful decision to visit the place with my family, we loved the various articraft collections they had.

53,Ancient History Museum,"Though we did not have much time, However, the museum has a lot of artifacts & is very well maintained."
54,Ok,An amazing collection of relics amassed by one man over a 40 year period. Displayed over 3 floors. Not too crowded.
55,Just a collection of statues and pictures,"You can not visit Kochin and miss this museum. First of all, the building is amazing: made of wood with sculpted ceilings, it has 3 floors divided by different eras. All the items are apparently from a private collector and they are all wonderful and incredibly interesting! This was an absolute joy to visit, make sure you have 1 hour at least to see it all."
56,Interesting bits and pieces of history in a compact space,"The museum is literally packed with all sorts of amazing artefacts. If you like museums and history, you must visit here!"
57,Interesting Museum!,It is a nice museum with a huge collection of artifacts. I recommend reading about it before going to appreciate the museum.
58,Interesting,What could have been a really interesting visit was spoiled by the curators hard selling the exhibits. 
59,Not worth visiting,"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this museum. An amazing collection of historic artifacts from Kerala and other Southern Indian areas. As a privately owned museum, they have done an excellent job of displaying a diverse range of objects reflecting the rich heritage of this part of…"
60,museum,"One of the best personally curated museums I have ever seen. It has a huge collection of drsses, masks, ornaments, musical instruments of Kerala culture. Even kids in our team have enjoyed it. A must visit in Kochi."
61,Amazing Collection,"This superb collection is the result of one man's passionate and lifelong interest in South Indian cultural artefacts. George Thaliath and his family designed and constructed the wonderful building from old demolished houses and it houses a superb range of sculptures, ceramics…"
62,Interesting & Educational visit,"This is an amazing place, not your usual museum, this is one mans collection and is family run. There are 3 floors crammed with incredible pieces of art and architecture, each more amazing than the first, and they have so many items in the collection that you can actually buy…"
63,OKish,I highly recommend this for a couple of hours the building itself is amazing and the artifacts also of great quality. Some are even for sale.
64,You could spend all day looking at the amazing collection of artefacts,"It is so fascinating,interesting muesum ..One can't miss this if you are interested to know abt art&culture of southern states...Kerala in particular.Staff is v.co.operative,ever ready to clear our queries.what ever we see here are collected by a single person,from last 30 yrs.. Including doors, staircases, Ceilings!!Passion behind this,can be seen."
65,Vacation ,Nice collection of old artifats which alone do not make a story but come to live buy the guide whose enthusam for the collection and the way he tells the tale made it an interesting visit.
66,did not stop,Another place we did not stop on tour but flashed by and by the time we where told what is was it was a distant memory.  Very poor guide
67,A MUST see,It was a good experience and the museum visit was worthwhile. There we saw a good collection of local ethnic things of Kerala
68,Well managed museum,A really interesting place. Three floors of fascinating exhibits that tell the story of Kochin very well. Definitely worth a visit.
69,Bad customer service,"Kerela folklore museum is not to be missed if you want to see how much a private collector can do to preserve the heritage of his Homeland.  Around 10,000 articles on exhibit with very friendly staff who explain the relics.  My favorite was the ancient musical instruments. A…"
70,A must see.,"My visit here was with family and they are a child friendly place-staff are extremely helpful and nice. Just keep an eye on the kids as there are many small items all over which they could easily reach and grab. The collection displayed was simply amazing, and to learn that it was all from a private collector makes it an even more magical experience. The building itself has fantastic architecture and the beauty of the displayed items is something you would not want to miss. Take your time in viewing the displayed items as they are really unique. Definitely a place worth visiting."
71,Historical Collections,"Was expecting exhibits behind glass and something quite formal...Oh what a surprise. It was like an ""Aladdins cave"" of artefacts all grouped together on 3 floors. Very little was behind glass as it was open to view behind unobtrusive barriers. The staff were friendly and…"
72,good place in kochin,The museum was my favorite thing to see in Kochi.  The museum building is beautiful; inside it impressively showcases three Kerala architectural styles--a different style on each floor. The detailed carvings on the ceiling are very lovely.   I loved the puppets and showcase of…
73,This place needs more visitors,"Could be visited if you are a history buff. Lots of things like Kerela's ancient jewellery, wooden carved items are placed here."
74,Good collection ,This was a wonderful place to visit for a couple of hours. A cultural hub to promote and preserve the culture & heritage of South India and displays more than 5000 artefacts and architectural objects spread over 3 floors. It reminded me very much of Kelkar Museum in my city of…
75,Awsome place for history enthusiasts,The collection is superb. It's surprising to know that one man has collected all these antiques and is exhibiting it.  Worth visiting!!
76,Not worth the money and time,"Kerala Folklore Museum, i just entered by seeing the board, from outside its just like a small temple, doesn't have a space like a museum. But they just surprised me inside. It is soo beatifull. Well maintained and i liked the kerala traditional Kathakali costume placed inside…"
77,A Treasure Trove,this is such an amazing collection. Full credit to the owners.  Do not miss miss this cultural site. 10/10 for me .... loved the experience
78,Hard Sell ,The artifacts on display are simply great. The guide explained in detail about each artifact. Must visit if interested in the history of Kerala
79,Top notch museum,"Now housed in a beautiful building, this is a private collection carefully brought together and displayed.  Members of the family were around to answer questions and talk about the exhibits."
80,SWINDLE,"The museum building itself looks like a Buddhist pagoda. It is primarily made of wood and looks stunning. The artefacts, paintings, coins, weapons, old manuscripts all are excellent and if you are interested in history then you can spend atleast half a day in the museum. The…"
81,Great little find,A quick visit to the museum should be accommodated in kochi itinerary as it wove a nice glimpse into the history and art of Kerala. Commendable is the fact that it is. A one man/ family collection   It’s well located on the way from airport or lulu mall to fort kochi so can be…
82,Jam packed with historical stuff,"It’s a good curation, but difficult to grasp so much as no guides... I understand it is because it’s a private curation. Items are on sale as well but they wayyyyy too costly. Not value for money"
83,House of history and culture,Fantastic insight to Kerala’s rich history. We definitely enjoyed the visit and were very flattered by the hospitality. My parents and my wife were visiting from the states. This is located near my dad’s hometown and he was very impressed.   This is a must do if you are visiting…
84,A fascinating collection that's well worth a visit,"This visit was one of the most interesting and important visits in Kerala - of all the museum's, galleries, Chinese fishing nets and other sigthseeing targets, was this the place were I got a feeling of the Indian culture, with its mix of religion, culture and beliefs.  Also,…"
85,This is a ‘must-see’ museum and please leave enough time...,What a great place! The collector has spent over 30 years gathering the artefacts inside and the building has even been made with parts of 25 other heritage buildings to make this the beautiful wonder it is today. A notice offers apologies for this not being a museum full of…
86,absolutely amazing,How can there be so much in one small building. If you only go to one tourist sight this is It. We took a taxi. It toik some time to get there from the ferry but worth the effort. The ladies working there gave information in a nice way. Some of them students. 
87,Tour of Kochi,"The most enormous selection of Kerala artifacts. Utterly fascinating, two hours well spent. Tuktuk from the ferry and 300R entry including camera fee. Complete bargain."
88,Wonderful Mueseum,"You have to visit this place!  It is such a gem.  This museum houses the astonishing collection of a private collector, whose family now maintains and protects the collection.  The artwork and cultural heritage collected within this museum rival some of the best collections I've seen in the US and Europe.  This is truly a Smithsonian-level collection, and all local to Cochin, Kerala, and Indian history.  If you like artwork and want to see a good museum in India, this is one of the best!  Plus, the nicest staff work there.  Absolute must-see!!…"
89,"Large collection of South Indian cultural objects, well displayed","Would not usually be my cup of tea, but this place is a treasure trove of South Indian culture, just wish we had had more time to spend there."
90,Private museum ,An impressive collection of artifacts by a private collector. This is a highly recommended visit for history buffs. There are items from the various religious communities and cultures in the area.
91,Lovely Museum,"This museum has comparatively a very expensive entrance fee, but the collection inside is so rich it is quite astonishing. The amassed folk art, the puppets, masks, gods, ceramics, furniture, lamps, altars etc. is speaks for such immense riches of human imagination and the…"
92,Traditional Kerala art and culture,"Excellent museum with very rare antique collections!! Its a splendid place to visit. a must visit. If you are fond of history, this is a place for you. The there inside is so remarkable. so immersive in nature."
93,The best museum we've seen in Cochi,"Definitely a must see place. The collection was unique and amazing. It can give you a glimpse of indian history about architecture,  wapons, clothes, trade, temples, culture and what not!!   You can also purchase few things from their but i felt they are little overpriced. This…"
94,RICH HERITAGE OF KERALA,"This museum is a good place to visit if you're interested in history and culture. It consists of the artifacts from as old as before 8th century AD. It consists of different stone statues, traditional musical instruments, doors, weapons, cooking vessels (big) etc. It is 3 storey building with different sections . The look is very good and along the staircase , there are various paintings from different famous painting schools including Raja ravi varma school.

95,Great place,A really interesting museum- well worth the visit. The guide was very knowledgable and we learned a lot about Keralan  artefacts
96,Great Antique collection!!,"Highly recommend stopping to have a look. Don’t expect an organised display, however it was fascinating to see the many bits that George had collected during his life.   There are over 20,000 artefacts within the museum and the building itself is an amazing piece of…"
97,Wonderful eclectic collection,"It says it all in the title. This is a wonderful collection representing the history, music, costume and culture with excellent explanations in English. From beautiful musical instruments and masks to pre-history burial jars; from amazing jewellery to ivory carvings; from huge, ancient carved cows that brought the hope of prosperity to farmers to 2000 year old tiny Buddha heads salvaged from river beds. I could go on. Just a tuk tuk ride away from the stalls of Fort Cochin across the bridge. Amongst all the great things we did here over 4 days, this was the best."
98,Wonderful,"Instead of waiting at airport, I chose to spend time here. Three story museum, private collection of articles from mostly 18th and 19th century. 100 per person ticket. Appears to be tourists trap."
99,Ahaha,"Spent one hour in this 3-floor museum, originally designed as a theatre for dance performances. The building itself is worth the visit: magnificent wood structure with stunning carved details.  The space is packed with an assortment of interesting artifacts, a n excellent…"
100,Great display and explanation of culture,What an amazing collection of around 25000 artefacts collected over many years by Mr George and his family. Unfortunately Mr George passed away recently but his wife and his son are fully in charge. Set on 3 floors in a beautiful building with amazing ceilings and wooden floors.…
101,Just Another Museum,I visited the Kerala Folklore Museum today and all I can say is 'Amazing'.  I was awed by the amount of artifacts that are on display at this museum plus the number of staff who are on hand to give a summary of each floor and to answer any questions.  Even the owner helped to…
102,Good Museum - Private Collection,Its really worth a visit to this museum. Collections are amazing.Very well maintained stuff .A person who is keen to know the history of Kerala would definitely enjoy this .
103,Excellent Museum,Amazing place with air conditioning. The museum is packed full of wonderful interesting pieces. The display is over three floors with many pieces for sale.  Allow a couple of hours to try to see everything. 
104,Good place ,"I was so glad we visited this museum. Not only is it chock full of some incredible antiques, and items of Keralan culture, but the entire place has been built with dedicated attention to the various old building styles of Kerala.  There was so much to see, that we only covered…"
105,"A heritage museum, every inch of space tells a story",We just reached on time to visit this museum in the evening.A very well kept place with artifacts etc from all over India. Its a private museum but collection of historical items is commendable. The structure & carvings in the building is also breath taking. The effort put in by…
106,An amazing place ,"Great place. Choc a bloc with artefacts, well maintained, very neat and clean. The wooden building itself is extremely interesting. Over priced, but being a private institution maybe required. Worth a visit."
107,Wonderful museum with Kathakali performance,"I visited this place with family, its amazing musuem and you need 90mts to go around. If you see form outside you will feel not needed to go but do go and see. They have amazing collection of artifacts."
108,Amazing Collection ,like walking into a garage sale.  not much explained but i was told they were all for sale.  a few display items captured my attention but again no one was available to tell me their stories.  charging inr200 entrance and this encounter felt like an amateurish attempt of a…
109,Has a breathtaking collection from different cultures in Kerala,This would have to be one of the best private museums I have come across.  The artefacts on display give a great insight into local history and the guide on hand was engaging with my family to bring many a story of the items to life.  Super cheap entry too.
110,Amazing museum in Kochi,This three story museum would be enhanced with a declutter and professional labeling of exhibits. It was very interesting but did not flow. 
111,Worth the visit - for sure!! ,"During our recent visit to Kerala in November this year, we went to famous Kerala folklore museum in Kochi. it's a privately established and maintained museum so they charge, 200 rs per head for entry!! it's a three storied building made up mostly of wood.  Folklore Museum is a…"
112,Awestruck,"A wonderful collection of traditional items and artefacts beautifully displayed in a fantastic timber building. So many things to see on three floors.Excellent, helpful and very knowledgeable staff to answer any questions.A must see if visiting Kochi."
113,excellent,"It's a compact place to have a glimpse of the traditions of Kerala with Three different dynasties, as well as a lot of antique artifacts to shop for. "
114,Very Average,"This is a cultural delight, steeped in history and is a great place to visit.  The owners are very proud to preserve its heritage and I would definitely recommend."
115,Wonderful Visit,Must visit place for people who have a thing for history and old world. It is commendable that for a man and his family members have been collecting all these vintage work over decades to set up this museum. 
116,surprisingly good,Some really interesting artefacts with informative guides. They do however push you to buy things. Worth a visit - a bit like a crazy car boot sale.
117,Beautiful,"It's been a revelation to me. Never thought one man's passion to collect and exhibit art can turn out to be so beautifully manifested. It's a huge treasure and at ridiculously low entry ticket. Authentic traditional collection all under one roof.If there's one ""must visit"" museum in Kerala it is this. Meticulously maintained spotlessly clean it's a treat. If there's one flaw that is too many in too little space. Fund constraints may be  restricting the owners from expansion.Interested in art culture tradition or history this is the place"
118,Unbelievable...must visit,"We reached the museus by taxi, but I believe it will be easy to get there by bus or bicycle.  We left the shoes at the entry and there is a free entry and another fee for pictures.  Beautiful collection inside and staff and very informative.  Beware you will need to climb…"
119,What a suprise,Our driver took us to this museum and they charged us nearly 500 since we were foreigners even though for Indians it costs even less than half. It is a collection of items (many repeated items of the same nature and placed at different places) that the Museum founder had collected from Kerala culture over the last 40 years or so. I think the only amazing part for me was to see the wooden roofs than anything else. It is very hot and can feel a bit claustrophobic inside because of lack of ventilation. Not something that I would recommend as high on the list.
120,"Artefacts, artefacts and artefacts",Unbelievable collection on several floors. Helpful staff willing to explain. You can spend the whole day here and discover and admire.
121,museum of delights,Very good collection and very large; good to spend couple of hours or more and see and understand even a small number of them.  The guides are helpful.
122,A wlakthroug to the history of Kerala,Beautiful collection.   Overwhelming history and beauty.   Definitely worth visiting to see Kerala history visually.  
123,Interesting and informative,Amazing to see one man's effort in conserving the heritage. I would recommend to add it in a Kochi trip. The four storied building itself is quire impressive. Do not miss the ceiling at the top floor. Only wish they could allow free entry of cameras.
124,Breathtaking,"This lovely artefact- rich museum housed in a traditional Kerala building is the labour of love of one man George J Thaliath and his desire to share the wealth of the culture and heritage of Kerala. Lovingly set up, well documented and supported by an extremely courteous and…"
125,Worth a visit,"This is a museum of sorts but doesn’t really focus on anything specific, it’s a whole collection of anything from ancient India but there are thousands of items. It cost 200 rupees to enter (each) but an extra 100 if you want to take photos. It reminded me of The Greatest…"
126,Indeed a folklore... amazing one,"I really like Kerala style wooden houses, and this recently remade three story house is a nice setting for this tight collection of thousands of items spamming centuries. I enjoyed the wall paintings, prayer books, and household items mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries"
127,Don't miss this amazing collection,I have never seen a private museum with such a diverse and large collection. Entry fee is 200 INR and to take photos is another 100 INR. The museum has multiple floors and shows artifacts that are more than 2000 years old all the way to more recent centuries.  The staff is…
128,Impressive building and collection,... this place is crammed with artefacts .. not always well labelled... but some fun things ... it was very hot although the outside temperatures was not ... so beware in the height of the hot season !! We were there less than an hour 
129,Amazing Museum!,"This museum has lot to offer to travellers and tourists. Very good artifacts and vintage place. This should be there in your bucket list when in Kochi, Kerala."
130,Spectacular!,"The building is made of wood entirely, so you ought to be careful walking through especially the stairs. YOu get to see soo many things displayed of historical value. But sadly the organization isn't that good as much of it is crowded with items. But it was good and worth a…"
131,Amazing Artifacts,"This wonderful private collection of world-class cultural objects should not be missed!  Beautiful building, amazing collection, and you might be lucky enough to meet one of the family members and have a chat with them (we did)."

133,Amazing place to visit.,It's so crowded with historical items I never seen so much in a museum the building is new built with old design but it's small for such big no of items 
134,Amazing private collection. Well worth a visit,We loved this museum. Yes it was jammed pack with relics and no there wasn’t detailed descriptions but it was filled with unusual items that told a story of a people.   It isn’t like a traditional museum.  There are some magnificent pieces and ones you might not see elsewhere. …
135,Beautiful collection of artefacts ,"If you are starting your Kerala tour from Kochi then you should not miss this museum. This museum gives you a proper flavour of the Keralian culture which helps you expand of sphere of knowledge. Its unique Keralian architecture, its collection of artifacts, pottery, jewellery,…"
136,A must visit in Kochi if you are interested in history and artefacts,it is a nice place for the people who love old artefacts and history. if you love to learn about the ancient period and about hindu mythology do vist here. otherwise it should be avoided.  nice staff and well maintained museum
137,Intersting and overwhelming,"Seen almost by accident, lots of artifacts from all over and some are even for sale on one of the upper floors."
138,crazy colourful collection,It's a very huge museum (3 storey) with many historic items preserved. You might take an hour or more to cover the entire place. The staff is very strict about the closing timings so better be here way before the closing time. There's a Saree shop inside which sells the…
139,Ancient artefacts,Nothing much to wow as it is simply an museum type where the attendants will not even help you if you have any doubts. It's like a free walk through inside.
140,Informative,"Packed full of exhibits in a building made with with wonderful ceilings from long demolished houses, the highlight was the explanation by the curators. Ria was so knowledgeable in good English that the culture came alive."
141,Intense Experience ,Must watch .very different from other museums. My wife who doesn't like museums and historical places .was also very impressed.
142,Must visit Kerala...,"This place is packed to the brim with historical artifacts. Its a private museum situated in Thevara, right in front of KEYS SELECT HOTEL.  A wonderful place to visit once.  Entry Fee - Rs. 100 per person Additional Rs. 100/- for photography"
143,Worth the visit,"It takes your breath away when you seesuch a vast one man collection! Such a variety! Malabar, Cochin and Travancore. All are there. Antiques, manuscripts, arts, dances, arms, furniture, carvings, painting, musical instruments,... You name it and they have it  Breathtaking is…"
144,Good place,"This museum is based on a collection of items acquired by one family. It is more a group of relics and art than a museum of Keralan folklore. It does have an area on Kathakali dances however. An interesting place to break a journey, but don't expect to learn much from your visit"
145,Great Collection of Artifacts,"Great Little Museum with great collections -- filled with so many collections inside! If only they could get a bigger building to accommodate all collections inside, that would be great! However, the building itself is already a nice place to visit. Love most of the collections…"
146,Had a good experience  but the thungs you try to sell are not worthy,Really enjoyed visiting this museum. It was a good learning experience of the art and culture in Kerala and South India. All the artifacts were well maintained. Special thanks to our guide Ria for taking her time to walk with us while explaining every item that we passed by…
147,Interesting museum ,Privately owned. All tour operators want to take you there as they get commissions. Save yourself the effort 
148,A labour of love by the owners,Well worth the small entrance fee if passing to see some amazing local history and culture. There is just so much to see.
149,.,"The staff were outstanding and very helpful in every way.  This is a very interesting place chock full of artefacts that portray the history of Kerala.  The bottom floor is dedicated to the northern part of Kerala (Malabar), the next floor up is dedicated to Kochi (the central…"
150,Sooo many things to look at,An enormous private collection of Indian and local artefacts displayed over several floors. Take your time as there is so much to see. No inside photography allowed.
151,Must visit,This place is an absolute find and truly off the radar. We would have missed it totally if not for our driver who knew us enough to bring us here. If you are remotely interested in India's history and past make this place a must visit. This 3-storey building is filled to the…
152,Well worth the visit,"If you are interested in historical museum, this is the perfect destination. Ancient paintings, vessels, clothes, handmade instruments, door designs, musical instruments all of this at one place. They are charging RS. 100 per person and extra charge for camera. Minimum time…"
153,Nice collections and displays.,"Private museum with a very good collection of temple artifacts and other antique items, set in a beautiful building. "
154,Wasnot great,"This is a private collection converted to a museum. There are lot of good, interesting pieces. The display can be improved with a good curator. The staff is only present in the shops at the top level"
155,So much to see!,"the museum is lovely, and has a great collection of items.  there are some descriptions around the objects, but there isn't a comprehensive structure or a storyline around which the objects and displays are arranged.   It just feels like a bunch of interesting stuff been piled…"
156,Museum,"The museum is housed in a beautiful building, and has a large and varied collection of artefacts. It would provide a better experience if there is some curation. The museum may also be short-staffed as there was hardly anyone keeping an eye on all the visitors. We saw two Indian families who literally touched every single object on the first floor, also draping their arms around the exhibits to take photos. And the grandfather even put a little boy, about three years old, onto an elephant statue to have his photo taken! And he did that twice. It is a pity that the founder of the museum wishes to share his collection but the visitors do not care to help preserve it. A sad thing to watch.The interior design and architecture of the museum is very interesting as well. We may have enjoyed that more than all the numerous artefacts just piled together. I can see how it's a personal style, and maybe the focus is in the vast collection and not the curatorial eye. It's not bad for an overview of the regional culture, but not for a more in-depth knowledge."
157,Amazing - Dont miss,"Its a small museum takes about an hour or so, it has a collection from around the world, pleasant enough"
158,"Amazing, Simply Amazing","Don't expect a typical museum. There are cupboards of coins and palm frond texts that seem like a display of curios in a home, but at the same time, there are larger pieces with more information than some government museums provide. The design of the home built exclusively to…"
159,Not your usual museum,"A good place for lovers of ancient history . Many old monuments, relics are available here. well maintained."

162,good place to visit,For just £2 per person you can visit this little jewel of a museum.  The displays extend over three floors and there are fans on the ground floor and air con on the floors above.  Well worth a visit as there is a really good display of cultural items and artefacts.  You’ll want…
163,Wonderful gem,I loved visiting this museum while in India. There is soooo much stuff here. So much history and culture! Entrance fee is totally worth it!
164,Extremely rewarding museum,"Fascinating collection of art and artifacts from Kerala. A relatively small building, but with so much to see, and the staff are so enthusiastic to explain and inform. It’s possible to buy authentic items, both old and new, which are sold to raise funds for the museum."
165,The history of kerala well maintained ,"On our first trip to Kerala/Cochin our driver suggested this museum.  On entry were charged 200 rupees per person plus 100 rupees to use a camera therefore, for two people 500 rupees.  Immediately after entry we were approached by an attractive young lady asking ""where are you…"

170,Wonderful collection of Indian cultural artefacts,"From outside it looks like a regular ancient villa, but inside you will find an excellent collection of artifacts from various time periods. It amazed us how this villa could host such a fantastic collection of items. This place is not very well suited for kids or elderly people or people with mobility issue.…"
171,Very large collection .. Only the selling attempts take one point,This place is a must go for history enthusiasts.

174,Kerala Folklore Museum - an unknown gem of Kochi,"Our driver took us to this place as it is supposed to be a good place to visit, while in Kochi. Entry fees was Rs 100 plus Rs 100 if one wants to take photographs. Not worth it at all. No credit cards and only cash is taken.   It is like somebody has collected some old artefacts…"
175,Good Museum,It is musiume which will help us to known about the history of Kerala.Not a crowded place.It will be awesome for the first time visitors.

177,Must see,"This is a great place to visit if you are in or near Cochin. It's a beautiful old wooden structure, packed full (almost too full!) of an eclectic collection of crafts, furniture, dance costumes and memorabilia from Kerala and other south Indian states. A real treasure trove, not…"
178,The visit to this museum was our favorite experience in Kochi.  We expected to spend 1 hour and spent over 2!,I really had a good experience in watching old things and paintings but soveniors were not worth of cost... Please dont try to make fool of your guests 
179,A must,Tuk tuk drive away and well worth the history lesson that is available as one goes around. May be worth getting a guide though although some of their English can be tough to understand.
180,Very nice collection and well presented ,"A bit off the beaten path in Kochi, you will find the Kerala Folklore Museum, which houses the collection of a single individual on three floors. The artifacts are displayed in an organized chaos and represent the incredible richness of (mostly) South Indian culture. The…"
181,Wonderful,"Every visitor to Kochi or Fort Kochi should visit this Museum. Take your time! The building, a beauty in itself, is loaded with the most interesting pieces of art. The passion of the man who put this art collection together is noticeable allover. I am glad I read about him upon leaving. It explained the uniqueness of it all!"
182,Amazing collection of artefacts,"Just outside Fort Kochi, is this private collection of a family. Founded by George Thaliath and his wife Annie George, this museum has an unbelievable collection of artefacts and paintings from various parts of Kerala. George is no more but his wife and young son Jacob manages…"
183,Excellent experience... not to be missed,"It was amazing to be in a museum loaded with artefacts and relics many many centuries old.Due to the vast collection, space appears overloaded,needs patient walk,and every step will offer atleast 5-10 artefacts to see,read and experience.   Saw a pair of metal Boomerangs from…"
184,Absolute gem!,It is a private museum wherein an individual has collected so many artifacts. He has good collection of them and many are on sale. But I found prices little high and many items you can find in Delhi. Can be visited once
185,Very good collection of Cultural and historical artifact.,Worth an hour many rooms and items of local history arts craft culture and tradition. Value for money in an interesting building and setting.
186,Let's bring back tradition ,"Kerala Folklore Museum consists of a huge private collection of artefacts.

So much to see and marvel at and not at all stuffy or worthy just a joyous mass of weird and wonderful stuff. We had a lot of items explained to us by a lovely young guide and everyone was welcoming. Can not…"
188,Fascinating folklore muesum.,This is outside mainstream Fort Kochi or indeed Cochin but it is absolutely worth a visit if you have an interest in the culture of not just Kochi but also India.  It is jam packed with all sorts of weird and wonderful items and I just loved it.  Fun place to wander though
189,Exploring Kochi,This place has an impressive array of historic things that are displayed. Unfortunately the displays are very crammed and dusty and could be maintained better. Its though a non government supported location and the entrance fees and donations go towards the preservation of this place.
190,A trip through our history,"This has to be one of the best"" cabinet"" museums in Kerala. One man's forty teat quest to encapsulate his culture in, predominantly, carving. Very little tat, mostly quality artefacts displayed in a quite haphazard way. This museum should be supported, go there."
191,Private Museum,The building itself is unique and offers a nice look into the past. All of the artifacts inside certainly give a good idea of what was here long ago. You can get antiques and new junk at the museum if you like. Others complain about the 100 rupee price but the lady running the…
192,Great Little Museum!,Was really interesting and varied.  So much to see. Think entrance fee was 200 rupees.  Have to oay to use camera.  On 4th floor there is a little cafe where a lovely lady made me a cup of tea.  Some items available to buy
193,Impressive collection in beautiful building,Full of antique and historical crafts and products. Unique collections and  it says a lot about history. Amazing experience.
194,My most memorable experience of Cochin,This family owned museum has been built up over many years and showcases a massive variety of Kerala artefacts. The themes for each floor are slightly lost by the sheer volume of material on display but a great insight into the area's background and culture.
195,good place to understand history of Kerala,I was totally overwhelmed by the amount of items the founder of this private museum collected. So much history under one roof - with one wooden ceiling weighing more than 30tons! A must see.  
196,Fascinating,"Rare, wonderful, and well maintained private museum. Spread across three floors, they have an amazing collection. Must visit to understand the culture and history of Kerala. Sculptures, paintings, artifacts, old photos, costumes, jewellery, masks, weapons and so much more. They…"
197,A superb personal collection,Though a bit out of Tourist area but museum was worth a visit. Good collection of Kerala history. Top auditorium with mural painting are really beautiful.
198,Kerela Folklore Museum,A very good collection of 5000+ artefacts from various places of south India including my native Chettinad. One family of antique collectors preserving so many artefacts is simply amazing and hats off to Mr. George and his family. I had a short interaction with his son Mr.Jacob George and understood their passion to bring back tradition and preserving our culture. I think government should provide financial aid for such noble cause. Let's bring back our tradition.
199,Pressurised sales tactics,We were kicking our heals waiting for our plane(s) back to the UK and our driver suggested we go to the Kerala Folklore Museum.  More in hope than expectation we agreed and what a great find!  As a foreigner entry was 200 rupees plus an extra 100 to take photos.  The place was…
200,Wonderful,"No words to express, it is really  nice to click photos and enjoy the folklore experience, thrilling experience, some more to added in their collection"
201,Fascinating.,A very interesting private collection of items spanning approximately 35 years.

I purchased some very attractive jewellery at a very reasonable price.
202,old artefacts,"There are 10,000 exhibits stuffed into a 3 storey house that belonged to a private collector. It only costs 200 rupee to go in and you won,t be disappointed. There is a gift shop but no pressure and there is a toilet. Prince Charles is one of the sponsors and the museum has no…"
203,"centuries old art pieces, figurines, paintings","Not only is the building beautiful, the gates are striking but the real treasures are inside and lots of them.  Cost 200 rupees per person entry and 100 for camera fees but well worth it.  You will want photos to remind you of everything because your eyes will not be able to…"
204,A fleeting visit on our way back to the airport,"I visted this museum on a Sunday noon , the ticket cost is expensive 100 Rs, as its a private owned , the museum is dumped with many artifacts ,antiques , in two floors ,pottery , crafts, coins ,There is also a 7 year shop we can purchase some and takes and traditional sarees…"

210,The real history of kerala,"This rich collection draws one into the spirituality of Indian and Kerala people in ways far more intimate and compelling than vast, imposing cathedrals, like Notre Dame.

211,A gem,it is a small museum of the king who lived and a must see place. shows a way of ancient life that too this part of life and how it was difficult
212,Good collection of bizarre items,"The museum contains many interesting artefacts and it is placed in a very beautiful building. The staff were very informative and helpful, especially lady called Maria and her colleagues who helped us to organize a taxi. Thank you for your kindness and friendliness."
213,"Museum of traditional local architecture as well as crafts, folk art & antiques, with a cafe & shop.","Lots of museums have lots of space, and too little to exhibit; here, the available space is barely sufficient to accommodate the wealth of artefacts. The building itself is part of the exhibit, and architectural details, carvings, statues, temple implements, clothes, Christian,…"
214,Worth the visit ,So nice to see this private collection. Kudos to the family who does this. Kerala has a lot of history and talent and so proud to see this initiative showcasing our rich art and cultural heritage.
215,Well worth a visit,"one of the fine attraction when you visit kochi,mattancheri,we can see the finely curated remains of the past history."
216,Very interesting,"A family run enterprise and owned by a private trust, the collection contained in this three storeyed heritage house constructed to reflect the traditional architecture style, is truly impressive. Most of the internal structure is made of wood, and I was particularly awed by the…"
217,Real experience,In a splendid wooden house which contains an enormous private collection of around 4000 artifacts. It is the dedication and immense work of George J. Thaliath and his family over the last 3 decades which allows us to see this cultural treasure. No visit to Cochin is complete…
218,A must visit in Kerala,Kerala Folklore Museum is one of the well maintained museum i have ever seen. A very good range of collection one could see here. But many of the items collected were repetitive. The museum needs to have a good arrangement for the ventilation. They charge high for entry with…
219,Beautiful museum in Kochi,There are several floors full of history and so many things to look at. It's hot in the museum and there are almost too many things to look at. Not at the things are in english.
220,"first class experience with the old age equipments,instruments and so on","A very large collection of South Indian folk art, confusingly arranged and displayed, with almost no signage.  Nonetheless there is much here to be enjoyed and appreciated for quality of workmanship.  Some of the exhibited pieces may be purchased."
221,Fabulous collection,"A good option to spend an hour or so, if you are not into history and sculpture. But if you are interested in history its a good place to spend quality tine. And learn more. Entry fee rs 100 per Peron and additional rs 100 for cameras which is not worth paying. Its a 2 storey…"
222,Lovely museum ,"Is bigger than it looks. Has 3 floors in total. Privately run museum with lots of antiques . Kudos to the curator for the variety of collection here. Maintained well . Lot of temple pieces, idols, furniture, urns and what not."
223,Kerala Folklore Museum,"Sorry to say I found a bunch of old dusty nonsense things, I don't think it should be a museum especially because the aim is to make you buy a few old stupid souvenirs at the second floor. Very disappointing... "
224,History lovers,Tracing the three cultures that combined to produce what we now see as Kerala. An amazing array of artefacts painstakingly assembled and displayed this is worth taking time to view. They receive no official funding so need as many   visitors as possible.
225,"""Cultural and historical synopsis of Kerala""",This is an amazing place with thousands of exhibits. It is arranged on 3 floors and the top one has an amazing ceiling with intricate woodwork and murals all around. Some of the exhibits are not as old as you initially think. There a lot to see but it’s stacked up rather than…
226,Well..if you have spare time..,"To get a better understanding of the life, culture and history of Karelia, a visit to this museum is a must. At a cost of Rs 150, you get to visit the art gallery which is housed in four galleries. Then there is the doll museum which depicts the dressing of the various places in…"

229,Tourist trap,"Artifacts of three styles - Malabar, Portuguese, and Travancore.Interested in learning a little about Kerela? then its a must visit!"
230,Quirky and Cluttered,This is privately owned museum.  There are some decent artefacts in the museum but donot expect what the govt owned museum has. The fist and second floor has artefacts too. There are sales counters and you can buy (at your dicretion) some vintage stuff (if you can identify).…
231,An idiosyncratic collection of traditional folk art and costumes,"Though there is a lot of beautiful art work at display here but after a while it becomes tiring, specially for people taking kerala tour and spending half a day at Kochi.  Additionally the ticket prices I thought must be reviewed and they should consider having a group discount…"

235,Very good,An elegant museum and very helpful staff.It contains artefacts from ancient terracotta figurines to 20th century idols. A must for all history lovers.
236,Travel into the ages of Kerala History and traditions..,Worth a visit but it is a little claustrophobic with steep stairs serving 3 floors. Outside it was 32 degrees and it became stifling in some of the narrow passages.There are a.c. units on some floors. There is some amazing stuff to look at so do go.
237,Pleasant surprise,"Spectacular museum showing about 10,000 artifacts from south India, with oldest artifacts dating back 2000yrs. A trip worth having to this museum. Highly recommended."
238,Good collection of antiques,"A young girl guided us round the ground floor, she was very informative and there were some very interesting things. However once we got to the next floor the hard sell began. As well as the usual souvenirs some of the artefacts were for sale and staff were very persistent in…"

247,Beautifully organized and wonderful artifacts.,Excellent collection of artefacts.  Large collection under one roof Can be given more space to distribute the artefacts. 
248,So much of History,In a compact building are many objects giving a good sense of the history and culture of Kerala and other regions. Helpful labelling of categories of items. Delightful and helpful guides. Easy bus ride from Fort.

250,A most interesting visit with a superb private collection,No significant attempt to present folklore of kerala in any authentic and cohesive way. Better save the money (Rs100 per person) and time.
251,Fantastic!!,Very well organize and painstakingly done museum made by a family. There are very interesting artifacts collected fro all over Kerala.
252,A great little find,"The Kerala Folklore Museum, privately managed, must be one of the most understated attractions in Kochi.

286,Ancient Indian Culture....,"Well, I would like to say that you should spend a half a day in here at least but the heat might consume you. First of all, it is a phenomenal museum. It is a collection of items by a family with no order, rhyme or reason to them. Everything you can imagine and can't imagine is…"
287,A great experience ,"An interesting collection of sculptures, wood work, pottery, Chinese storage jars, bronzes, stone work, old paintings and photos, jewellery, utensils, agricultural tools, ceremonial weapons, and other artefacts from across the centuries and different areas of Southern India. Housed in a equally eclectic building that has been put together from various salvaged ancient structures. It’s definitely worth a visit and some of the works on display are simply stunning, although it is a little overwhelming as the lower floors are crammed full of items displayed in a very haphazard fashion. It feels a little chaotic and quirky, and for us this made it a little more interesting. However, there’s no real organisation either by era or origin although types of items (coins, weapons etc) are mostly presented together. Some items are labelled and give brief descriptions. As a consequence it doesn’t really tell a story/inform or give much idea of the context for some of the items on display - its therefore more of a visual rather than educational/museum experience. There also does not appear to be much thought to preserving items - most are on open display in a warm and humid environment. A few ‘do not touch’ signs, but little in the way of any control of this. It’s also a little unclear on the upper floor what are display as opposed to shop items, and the mixture of things from fridge magnets to quite expensive painted face masks or prints makes it difficult to know if you are buying goods produced for the tourist market or genuine hand produced works."
288,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MUSEUM I HAVE EVER VISITED IN MY LIFE.,"Set on three floors,each dedicated to North, Mid & south Kerala nuances of art & architecture, this single-man's collection of over 30 years is a treat & a peep into Kerala's history.
