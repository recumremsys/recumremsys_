0,Lovely place,This is a lovely place to spend a few hours just strolling around There are some great bars and restaurants right on the marinaIt's a bit more expensive than away from the marina but it's a great place just to Sit with a drink and watch the world go by
1,Two oldies,The marina at Marmaris is lovely for a walk about there are lots of restaurants to have a drink or a meal also all the boats are there for the day trips also around the corner there is the shopping centre with hundreds of shops well worth a visit for some bargains
2,Review,A nice area to walk around and admire all the beautiful boats and stop for a coffee also some nice shops in the area and a small castle to see.
3,Very pretty,"A lovely place to stroll along in the evening, although quite busy. There are some very nice bars/restaurants where you can sit and watch the world go by."
4,Excellent ,Great to walk around day or night with loads of terrific restaurants.At night it is cooler and you can find a restaurant that is within your price range easily.
5,Really pretty,Went here mainly of an evening and the view was fantastic and there are loads of Bars and restaurants
6,Boat trip ,The marina is a great place to go see but the amount of hassle you get just walking past the restaurants is just silly. We walk down must nights and if your not hassled by the boat people try to sell you a trip then your hassled by the large restaurants trying to get you in. This can be very off putting so I suggest you try a walk the furthest side away and you get less hassle. Would be 5 star if it wasn't for all the hassle you have to contend with to have a quite walk around. I would return as some bars are good.
7,Walk,"Nice place for a walk with many restaurants, cafes and bars. There are many shops as well. You can also reach the Icmeler  by walking from the marina. It‚Äôs about 5 km."

129,Best place in Marmaris ,Lots of floating restaurants and boat trips available . Great setting for a walk in the sun. Just after the town. Bazaar close by
130,Marina,"The harbour is delightful, it is very picturesque. Half a day is enough especially if you have young children as there isn‚Äôt much to do, but if you want a nice peaceful walk then this is for you. A few shops selling the usual seashell souvenirs. I think pets are allowed as we saw lots of people with dogs bu5 the6 may have been locals. A few nice restaurants and pubs. Worth a visit but a couple of hours is enough."
131,Nice place to take a walk after dinner,"Great for a wander around with interesting bars/resturants, a bit more expensive due to location. Well worth a visit."
132,Not as big as I thought it would be,"Loved it here, ant wait to come back next year, the views are amazing,go to the bazaar near the harbour and grab a bargain lots of bartering to do"

134,Marmaris marina,This is beautiful to walk down just to Walt how the world go by and see all the amazing yachts and boats Beautiful well worth a walk and on way down lots of Caff√® Bars and restaurants you can have a stop  in
135,Quaint and Beautiful,We stayed at the Green Nature Diamond and the walk to the marina was about 45 mins.  A lovely walk and the marina is lovely.  But every single restaurant or bar you pass they are trying to entice you in even when you say no they‚Äôll follow you down the road. I didn‚Äôt like this at all and ended up being quite rude to some persistent ones.
136,sunset,No one can visit Marmaris and miss visiting the Marina and especially by night. Nice people and lovely faces with non forgettable memories.
137,Beautiful,A place with variety of restaurants cafe and bars .Watch for the prices before you go and especially for shisha prices.The best time to go is in the early evening before it is overcrowded

139,Lovely Marina,We stayed 2 nights in the marina the facilities are excellent and in a good location in the old town.Only downside is the noise at night as the old town are is club central and the music was on until after 3am
140,Holiday,Buzzing atmosphere lots going on. Bazaar market right next to the harbour with lots of shops. Buses running regularly and cost 50p each Approx kids free. Lots of restaurants. ATMs. Places to exchange money. Can get hassled a bit to come and have a look but that‚Äôs nothing.
141,Great for a walk about and drinks,"Very clean area to be honest most of marmaris is very clean they do that very well,loads of boats moored ready to book for various trips, some hassle to look n book but if you speak to them respectfully they will leave you alone, the castle is down here too and entry to the grand bizzar but get your hard haggle head on if going in, go to at least half any price said and stick to it, but do get bargains, all the restaurants in the marina change a few lira more per item than same at other places we looked but ended up not eating here..just because  og area the price premium as not worth it. But nice for a walk, look at the boats, and a it is bit more clubby come the evening."

147,Stunning,What a lovely walk to the marina lots restaurant and lots fabulous boats and if you actually make it to the end you can stop off at Starbucks for hot or cold coffee x
148,very good shopping,We went for dinner in the marina the food was mediocre and over priced. Lovely setting and good shopping in the bazaar though
149,Marmaris Harbour,"it was a beautiful walk and the boats were amazing to look at. we went super early and pretty much everything was closed.you will get accosted by merchants and shopkeepers to come in and be ""their first customer today"".i will say you can really get some value for money on items and the food is banging!buses are also you best friend as they're air conditioned and run so often you never get stranded."
150,Very beautiful  but so much hassle ,A posh part of Marmaris with nice boutique shops. I expected it to be a lot bigger and have more stores. But it was still nice for a walk. A lot of cafes and restaurants to eat it
151,Nice Marina.,"Marina itself is nice with loads of resturants and things to do , the only thing that was annoying was the shop keepers hassling you to come in there shops ! Some would be quite rude and swear at you if you didnt go in .. Just smile and say no thank you if you're not interested ... it helps a lot .."
152,Gorgeous ,One of the best marinas we‚Äôve visited and we‚Äôve been to many. Plenty of bars and restaurants with fabulous food and the bazaar/market is nearby. Views are stunning and this is a great place both daytime and evening.
153,STUNNING,Marina is beautiful stunning venue to eat a meal have been returning for several years would recommend this area highly.

157,A must visit if in Marmaris ,"Lots to see, do, eat, book boat trips...exciting bazaar/market where you need to haggle to get a good price."
158,Lovely part of Marmaris ,Nice harbour with plenty of eating places with a range of options and prices It also has a small rebuilt small castle which I would describe more as a fort
159,Marmaris a modern city with beautiful location and good shops and restaurants.,"Great place to drool over the luxury yachts and boats moored up. There is ample restraunts and shops near by (if a little more expensive than say further in town). If you don't like the heat its best to walk here at night than during the day, everything is open very late."
160,Beautiful setting,Nice place . Clean. Good choice of restaurants or bars. Plenty of excursions leave from the harbour.
161,Excellent!,"What fantastic place Mamaris is. When you first arrive it looks more like Hawaii with all the palm trees, and all those boats in marina look fantastic with endless row of restaurants facing the marina. Really wonderful.  Great restaurants,  great shopping, great fun atmosphere. Beach holiday resort feel to the whole place. Do one of the pirate boat trips. You will enjoy them. Will come back here again."
162,"Beautiful, serene!","Beautiful Marina very clean, great views, would highly recommend for Couples for a nice relaxing walk, day time no nice a quiet also when the sun goes down if you want to party this is the place, but im to old for that now so just day time vists for me"

164,Beautiful sights,"The Marina is a great place to visit time and time again for all the family... the yachts and boats there are amazing and you can‚Äôt move for cafe, bars and restaurants the hard job is picking which one to eat/drink in. Oh and the shopping is the best in Marmaris so great day and evening out a absolute must when visiting Marmaris and just 4TL each way on the bus from any stop and they seem to come every 5 minutes."
165,Great beach,Whether or not you are strolling along it during the day or taking a romantic stroll on an evening the Marina is beautiful. Lots of boats available for every type of excursion. There are boat taxis available to take you further afield for very reasonable amounts. Lots of places to eat and drink and all very reasonably priced. One of the highlights of our holiday.
166,lovely and clean,"Fabulous place with great bargains to be had, just be careful otherwise you could pay more than you really need to!!  Don't always be turned by the ""copy designer products"" as some of them are much better than others.  If you can get someone to recommend that is the best bet.  When shopping, always drink if you are offered it, otherwise it can be seen as insulting...if you really don't want to buy something, just tell them it is the end of your holiday and you haven't any money left as you spent it the last time you visited.  Above all, be polite and just say no thank you.  This is what I did when I was there and I had no trouble at all.  Have a great time!"
167,Amazing,"Had some fab days walking down and around the marina, few drinks on several bars, all the bar owners are so hospitable and very welcoming."
168,Evening stroll,Was in Marmaris for a weeks holiday and enjoyed to walk around the Marina during our time there.Fantastic views into the bay and plenty of tour boats to pick from should you want to take a trip out.Lots of nice cafe and bars to sit back and watch the world go by.
169,Wow,Great restaurants and selection of boats to drull over. Try it out and see what I mean. Close to the Bazzer for hassle free shopping
170,Vacation,"Fantastic atmosphere, ensure you walk round in the evening when its cooler, hundreds of boats, yachts, restaurants, people, boat trips, near is the club strip for the younger age group, take photos of lighthouses, spot the octopus sculpture, totally safe, mellow and atmospheric.... enjoy."
171,Marina,lovely walk along the beach to the Marina it is best to do it inn the evening as one its cooler and also all the boats are back yes Boats of all shapes and sizes with all kinds of tours to suit anyone (really) take a look you will love it .......
172,Yachts Galore,The marina in Marmaris is well wort a visit. Its lovely just stroll along the seas edge and admire all the beautiful yachts moored. There is quite a selection og eateries incase yph geg hungary or just stop for a drink.
173,Very nice place.....,The marine is full of restraints as you would expect but i like looking at the boats to which their is plenty to look at. Its a nice walk best done at night as most of the boat are lit up and back from were they have been.

177,Lovely Place,It‚Äôs worth a trip around the Marina if you are down that way. It goes in a big semi circle and the boats are extremely impressive and lots of them. Plenty of places to eat and drink and there is a Starbucks at one end serving great coffee for all those who need a decent coffee!!
178,Too cheap to miss out on,Lovely boat trips to various places and cheap .there is all inclusive trips .plus taxi boats which take you to icmiler. And turunc. Well worth having a go on them as they stop for swim breaks.
179,Idyllic,"Anyone who loves looking a beautiful boats will enjoy a stroll along the marina in Marmaris Old Town. Even if you know nothing about sailing or yachts, you cant fail to admire some of the fabulous gulet boats with their tall elegant masts, and polished wooden hulls, or the magnificent array of leisure craft and glamorous yachts moored along the seafront. They are the stuff of dreams - and James Bond movies! There are plenty of restaurants and bars with views of the waterfront at which to enjoy a meal or a refreshing drink. But choose carefully where you spend your money. These big, impersonal eateries are in a prime position so are not cheap. And they know most customers are just passing through and unlikely to return. So if you are unlucky, you may be disappointed with the quality of what comes on your plate! Probably better to choose a smaller, family-run restaurant who care about customer satisfaction."
180,Had a great time,Marina shopping is less fake and has lots of quality goods some slightly over priced but normal for  this type of marina Lots of boat shops as well fishing Chandler and clothingJust can‚Äôt afford any of the yachts !!!!!
181,Day visit ,"We came here a few times, very chilled and relaxed Nice to mooch and people watchGreat bars and restaurant we spent all our time in the Baris Bar, relaxing and lovely staff"

194,Boat trip,"The marina is beautiful all times of year. The sea is so bluey green and perfect. I love looking out into the ocean from here. The restaurant around the marina are deemed to be expensive but having looked around, I think you can get a meal for the same price as most other places. You will get pestered to go on boat trips but if you dont want a boat trip just stay away from the boats. This place is great for an afternoon stroll in the turkish sun."
195,Beautiful,Loved it down here and wish we had booked  to stay on beach front. All though busy and people always trying to get you in the restaurants its lovlie down here
196,The nice part of marmaris,Marmaris Marina is positively buzzing at nighttime- so many boats - of varying sizes mostly all available  for boat trips or private hire - is all lit up at nighttime. You cannot get away from the continued shout outs by the hirers to get you interested in taking on whatever they have to offer - after all you are in a marina. What‚Äôs delightful is the sizeable area to enjoy walking round comfortably - and it‚Äôs extremely popular as you are on the outskirts of the Grand Bazaar - so plenty to see and enjoy.
197,Very Nice Marina,I loved Marmrais more than antalya the beach was cuzy and quiet we had a boat trip for all iclands around Marmrais loved it
198,Nice ,The marina in Matmaris offers a welcome break from the chaos of the town.  Lovely restaurants and generally quieter

201,As restful as ever,"We visited the marina, where there are plenty of shops to purchase souvenir‚Äôs, gifts, handbags, shoes, and many more. The were lots of local bars and restaurants and lovely views of yachts and a boats. Definitely worth a visit and to see the Fountains."
202,holiday ,"loved it, beautiful boats, clean, great cafes and restaurants and cost effective - lovely walk along the promenade away to the harbour with amazing views"
203,Great boat trips from Marmaris Harbour on the DREAMBOAT,Avoid the shops they all hassle you as you walk past. The best shops were the ones owned by women. They left you to wonder around.
204,A beautiful place,"Not been to Marmaris in 10 years. It‚Äôs now much more upmarket than before with lots of ¬£1m boats parked up. Plenty of bars and restaurants available but you do have to run the gauntlet of touts. Felt very safe, worth a visit"

208,More than words ever could explain,"Marmaris City and Marina must be visited and see to enjoy everything view, weather, food, people shopping"
209,Never Gets Boring!,Yeah it's a great marina but aren't most marina's the same? Not knocking it as it really is a lovely place but to to be fair we have seen much better or more spectacular marina's. Wouldn't go out of my way to visit it for this reason but as we docked there we did see it. Worth a visit if you're staying in Marmaris and get a bit bored.
210,Love it,"Loved looking at all the boats and posh yachts, booked our boat trip from here. Bit of hassle with restaurant owners trying to entice you in .much improved over the years. A must visit."
211,Lovely place for a stroll,"A long walk here is what the soul needs. Take your time, enjoy the sunset and rising moon and visit a local restaurant. Pricier than the rest but often really good"
212,Marmaris marina,"Lovely boat trips, clean and great sight seeing of the coastline. People were friendly and trips were cheap"
213,Fantastic Place Must See,The best time to go in my opinion is early evening when the sun is going down and it‚Äôs a bit cooler. Looking out to sea in the distance are the mountains which is stunning. Lots of nice restaurants and bars to eat at and have a few drinks.
214,1st time,Good site plenty of choices to select trip boating hired one for scuba diving good experience lovely people and very helpful seen marine life. Good weather. Worth going there
215,A great walk,Marmaris marina is a place to walk eat and drink day or night. Night time prettier as all boats lite up. Excellent view with stunning scenery and a lovely walk. Visit the castle it‚Äôs about ¬£3 to get in the views are amazing from up top.

218,Glass bottom boat trip..,Very clean luvly boats to look at ( lotto win one day ) lots of places to eat and drink good place to pick cheap trips
219,Harbour,"We hired bicycles and went through the Marina cycling, although it's not allowed. I said to my girlfriend we must return at night. We did and it was gorgeous. A total different world from the promenade. Marmaris promenade can be very chavi, the marina area is not. It's actually very classy. Plenty to do. Lots of restaurants and bars. Without the marina I'd never like or want to return to Marmaris. But I'll return some day just for the marina and old town."
220,Great view,Had a walk from our hotel to the Marina area - seating stadium up for Turkey Rally taking place attracting more visitors.
221,A Turkish Gem,"It is a avarage place. Shopping, yatchs, bars, restaurants. It may  be little more to see on day time."
222,Mrs Sarah Donald,"Very busy in the evening especially. can get annoying having to constantly dodge people, you will get some hassle from bars and restaurants... but not too much."
223,Beautiful day and night.,"Whenever in Marmaris we always walk endlessly around the marina .Eat ,Drink,Hang out,   The boats and yachts a sight .Sometimes massive .Apparently one of the oldest Harbours in existence."
224,Rye ,"Second trip here, love this place. Great food, great atmosphere and more importantly great weather. Will definitely come again and again x"
225,Lots of shopping ,Lots of different trips to do and nearly everyone is friendly but some are too intrusive and don't leave you alone
226,Fab great chilled out place,"Had a great day out,with a great crew and lovely food and drink,very relaxing and great value for money,will definitely book again next April/May"
227,Pleasant surprise,"Nice views of the Marina.  Clean shops with no hassle, no haggle shopping for genuine labels (?).Gentle, calm area. Recommend the Roberts Coffee there."
228,Beat Harbour,We had lovely day @ Mamaris marine we need more time clean sandy beach very lively @nite lots of restraunt
229,Lovely Promenade,"What a beautiful marina,  360degrees great views would defo come back to this part of Marmaris. The choices of eateries and bars just goes on forever, it truly is gorgeous."
230,STUNNING HARBOUR,"Love this city . We had great time there. Hope to go there again. People,places ,everything! So much fun! The holiday I enjoyed most!"
231,Beautiful but not as peaceful as i would have liked.,Fabulous day out reasonably priced for all inclusive lunch and drinks. Sincerity staff made all the arrangements for us.
232,Beautiful boats and surroundings,"Great to look at boats and ships of all sizes, book a lazy day cruise or a fun day cruise,diving or fishing trip, with plenty of restaurants for food and drinks."
233,Ships,"What an absolutely stunning part of Marmaris.  Everything is so, so picturesque!  The mountain backdrop surrounding the harbour which is always full of the fanciest yachts and if your lucky the occasional cruise ship too.  There's an upscale shopping boutique nearby, no haggling in that part lol!There are also many sidewalk cafes and restaurants where you can sit for hours on end and still not want to leave."
234,Holiday not good ,Beautiful  place the view are breathtaking  well if you actaly.get a moment to enjoy with put being pestered or half dragged in to a shop of some.kind
235,Lovely place for a walk,I only have good things to say about Club Aida the staff from managers down to the cleaners are all friendly and helpful ok there are a couple of glass collectors that are quite but that‚Äôs because they are young new and don‚Äôt have much English but still very friendly.  The room hotel and pool are of excellent standard and the staff are always cleaning.  Food is gorgeous I recommend Flexi dine drinks are of international standard.  Can I also recommend the hamam and the professional masseuse they are well worth a visit I have shoulder injuries and just one visit helped we would have done more but that would have meant staying around the hotel rather than visiting our Turkish friends and revisiting the surrounding area 10 out 10 and we still have 11 days to go but we will be back
236,A ‚ÄòMust‚Äô for marmaris,"Full on strip everyone wants a piece of you, beware of the restaurants that have menus the size of the Argos catalogue  it can‚Äôt possibly be fresh cooked impossible ah well you live and learn."
237,Pete ,"Marina is beautiful, views lovely, nice clean friendly bars/restaurant and bazarra there also for lots of bargains"
238,MUST VISIT ,The bars & restaurants are of a higher quality due to the cost of the boats moored in the marina (millions of pounds worth)
239,Beautiful,Went a walk and be nite up the beach path until we reached the marina. Was nice at nite seeing all the boats with there lights on
240,Marina bay,"We are used to Kusadasi and this is a step up in quality, gorgeus location and excellent beaches, services and shopping. We will be returning and would recommend the resort of Icmeler a short bus ride from marmaris it is excellent for food and seaside facilities."
241,Very beautiful ,"The marina is a beautiful hot spot located south of the Marmaris strip, easy access via local transport, and also a nice walk in the early evening watching the sun set, boasting a wide variety of restaurants, Bars, clubs, and shopping available, just over from the marina is the Grand Bazaar, possibly the best shopping mall you have ever seen, labels like Gucci, Fendi, Rolex, Chanel, Versace, Louis Vuitton with a high street price, At 9pm each night there is a water shower just over from the marina wich is gorgeous to watch, dancing water to some of your favorite hits, boat trips are available most days from the marina so pop down and see whats going on,"
242,Relaxing,Lots of different things to do boat trips bus trips bike hire shopping heaven for the wife‚Äôs and girlfriends night mare for the men üòÇ
243,Lovely area away from the hustle and bustle,"The first time I have seen this place was the 80s and since then I visited it until today regularly and I will keep coming, too. It is a great place to have a walking tour. There are many cool places around to eat and drink. The Bar Street is also close to here and there is a nice bazaar around, too. The Netsel Marina is also a cool spot. Marmaris castle (Museum) is also at the top of here from where you can see the marina and central Marmaris and view is awesome of course."
244,Marina,"Amazingly, Marmaris turned to be one of the best towns for tourism in my view. Great hotels, easy transportation, acceptable food and most of all very nice, lively, long marina. You can never regret a 4-5 days family vacation to Marmaris. For the shopping, it is typically a Turkish experience as we all can imagine, however, good deals may occur. Overall, good destination for few days."
245,Fabulous Surprise ,"Well worth a visit especially in the evening go to the Jan de Wit restaurant, the sirloin and wine are excellent as are the staff."
246,Mamaris is truly a wonderful place,"Visited during the evening when the weather was a bit more manageable. Great area, plenty of bars and restaurants lined along the front. Prices not extortionate either!"
247,Good for a walk around ,Super clean lots of sunbeds waiter services regular rubbish removal not much cold selling all facilities to hand
248,Kev,went across on the water taxi from hotel the town its beautiful clean and interesting especially the market area real old world great fun to barter with the shop keepers well worth a visit
249,Lovely place for a meal a drink or just to stroll with an ice cream in hand,"Get out of the water before 10am mayhem begins. The coasts of Marmaris including the Marina is amazing to venture about by paddle board. Brought my inflatable board during my stay and learnt the hard way on day 1. All boat tours, jetskis, parasailing and watersport shananigans begin at 10am. Sunrises is at 7am so pace yourself to visit the Marina and it's amazing vicinity.Need any additional detail? Get in touch via IG @sup.mission"
250,Beautiful,Love Marmaris and everything about it. The place offers everything you could ever need for a magical holiday for all ages. The weather is amazing during the summer months and you will find many things to do around the marina and main Marmaris centre.
251,Worth a trip,"Recently visited the Marmaris MarinaFabulous to walk along and dream..I have never seen so many mega expensive boats all in one place The shops at the end of the marina are really nice, but a little expensiveThere are many restaurants around the Marina that cater for all tastes  and we found them to be quite competitively priced...I believe this is because there are so many to choose from so they need to compete with each other for the trade"
252,Beautiful landscape,"Large marina, interesting castle. Bazzar a pain, constantly hastled. Loads of places to eat and drink."
253,Family boat trip,"Be it the yacht marina or the town quay of the old town, this is the best part of Marmaris. Spoilt for choice with restaurants all offering good food at great prices, and a view of yachts and the lovely gulets coming and going from the harbour.  The  restaurants will try and tempt you in by offering the menu for you to read. But they are friendly and polite if you decline."
254,Beautiful,Beautiful harbour. so many gorgeous boats. How this country has come on in the last 30 years. they should e so ery proud
255,Nice but hassled a lot by locals ,Take a walk arround Marmaris Harbour you will be ammazed by what you will see from the humble local fishermens boats to the Multi Millionairs Ocean going Yachts.Dotted arround the spotless Harbour you will find a vast variety of shops from Eateries to Top of the Range Jewellry and Bags.Follow on around the Harbour and cross over the Bridge and find yourselves in a Millionairs Playground with the shops and Prices to Match.If your into photography you will get some amazing shots around the Harbour.Dont forget to  explore the many side streets that lead up to the Castle a must for any one interested in a little bit of History and culture
256,Picturesque,very friendly people gave u a drink in every shop helped u alot and let u bartered them to good prices
257,Beautiful,When on a day cruise with 4 swim stops unfortunately the water was cold and no one would go into the water . The lunch iron the boat was really good and everyone seemed to have a great time would recommend a boat trip in marmaris
258,Super location,Very similar to victoria and albert in cape town but on a much smaller scale.  What can i say about a marina.  Beautiful boats owned by people with a lot more money than me.  Totally envious but in a nice way.
259,Beautiful place,Lovely place been a few times wel. Worth visit loads of bars to choose from beach is nice. Turks nice people
260,Attractive Marina at a Surprisingly Beautiful End of Marmaris,Great Budget Hotel Great Value Room Clean Great Staff don't expect 5**** Location very good Food is ok plenty of variations
261,Fantastic nighttime in the Marina Marmaris,"Had a half day trip by boat to Marmaris, only 25 mins, the marina is very modern and had a lot of money spent on it, well worth a visit, to get a bargain"
262,Buzzing,"We LOVE Turkey. So much so, we have holidayed in many locations there 16 times in the past 17 years.It's fun to visit Marmaris' Bazaar and to enjoy taking home such high quality goods at amazing prices - though the constant haranguing by every single trader can get tiresome, but of course it's their business to do everything they can to get you to buy from them, not from another trader selling the same goods.Apart from Bazaar shopping, nothing else in Marmaris ever attracted us - until we stayed at the Imperial (the opposite side of Marmaris Bay).We took the 30 minute water taxi which docked in Marmaris Marina. We were really impressed with it. As we walked from the marina towards the Bazaar, we were so surprised at how beautiful that end of Marmaris was. Definitely far more high end than anything we'd seen on many previous visits to the other end of Marmaris."
263,We love this place!,Boat trip with big boss toured was amazing so we went twice staff were awesome and would definitely go back to them for any trips
264,Very pretty,Been going to the  beautiful marina for years . and it's changed so much over the years it seems to get more beautiful if that's possible.everytime we visit .l love going to see the boats and have taken some of my most memorable days from here .on a Boat/Gulet a lovely married couple an English lady called Caroline from Manchester and her Turkish husband Ozzy have given us some of the best days out on the Boat/Gulet MY LOVE it was called .they had it for years .but we have been going back to find them every time we visit . and unfortunately they've not been there for the past 4 years  .I know they sold the boat but still worked it has the new owner was poorly .at the time.but we also know they was waiting to buy another Boat/Gulet‚õµ would love to see them again after spending quite a few years of going out with them .but hopefully we are back in August just a couple of weeks away.and we just might find them while sat having a nice meal at one of the lovely restaurants in the evening .it truly is lovely the marina it becomes truly magical in the evening's . when it' gets busy and all the lights are on you can just have a nice stroll or just sit chatting to the lovely people Turkish or travellers from all parts of the world.im sure who ever spends time strolling or sitting watching the world go by will have lasting memories forever .
265,Short break,"Decent food and drinks however be prepared  to be hounded for extras, 241 cocktails then once your in they keep j√§ger bombs flowing whilst ripping you off smart extortion tactics ... HOI JEIMMY !! üáπüá∑üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøüçæ"
266,Great for People Watching,We had never been to Turkey before so I really did not know what to expect.   From our cruise ship we could see the nice lush vegetation on the island and the beautiful  ships in the harbor.   We got off the cruise ship and were right on the marina.  No need for a tender a d we walked right through  custo.s without even having to  show a passport.   The marina itself had a number of nice shops and restaurants  but the bazaar was a shop walk. I had never seen anything like it.  The shopping  was inc6givdn the strength of the US dollar.   If I have the opportunity to  go back in the future I would like to see a lot more of  Turkey  but I  would say Marmaris was a wonderful place to spend a day in.
267,The Marina,Nice for chill. Away from hustle and bustle of marmaris but easy to get to marmaris on daily boat .üòé
268,Lovely walk,"Went for 3 hrs, could have done in 1.5 hrs. Some amazing boats ‚Äò look up Haida‚Äô in on day sail boats super yachts etc etc. Amazing diamond shop, great bars shish-a bars and covered market for Rhodes looking for original fakes !!!"
269,Beautiful!,relaxed place. i loved the pine apple restaurant. highly recommended. clean and mediterrenean feelings
270,nice to walk around,Visited marina area during week's stay in Marmaris. Plenty of opportunities to take long/short boat trips. Plenty of benches to sit on to watch the world go by. Lots of small individual shops & market hall in the vicinity as well as some great bars & cafes along the Promenade. Worth a visit if in the area.
271,Great yachts and Gulets,"Typical Turkish market.....all genuine fakes, hassle from the shop and cafe owners....if you can bear it, it's a hell of an experience"
272,Turkey Rally,"Marmaris in a town set in some of the most amazing land/seascapes you could ever find, the town itself is very modern and aimed mainly for the tourist, you have to head well away from the harbour to find the real town and Turkish personality‚Äôs."
273,very clean,Lovely and relaxing.....great views of the various lovely boats and yachts......and many lovely restaurants...
274,Everything at your fingertips,"Went on Viking day trip had a great time drink and food all in crew are great swimming in sea foam party at the end, well worth a go"
275,Family holiday,"We had a family holiday August last year. Went on the Dreamboat twice. Brilliant!! Anyone visiting Marmaris should make it a must. Food and drink is included in the price and the people who run the trip are so welcoming and friendly. You stop for swimming, shopping etc. We had lots of fun. Can't wait to go back."
276,Full on Benidorm with s Turkish twist,"Super location at the entrance of Netsel Marina and town Marina with a panoromic view of Marmaris Harbour and Marina ,Nicely designed and decorated , Very good food , friendly service , 2nd day here and only getting better , will be back ,"
277,"Clean ,pretty area,full of boats , and hassle plus many raised prices",Went for Coffee here after visiting the castle. Couldn't believe how cheap it was Cappuccino tea and a gluten free brownie ¬£3.
278,What a View !1,"Been in Marmaris for a few days and the place reminds me of the Benidorm of Turkey.We love Turkey and have been to some amazing places, this is like Blackpool with a lot more Kebab houses and guaranteed sunshine, minus the tower! Shame because it could be really good and if the restaurant touts would leave you alone for more than 5 mins I‚Äôd of given it a better review"
279,Nice place,"Usually we go the other side of Turkey (Antalya) But due to a good deal we decided this year on marmaris. We went out for a shopping evening to the grand bazzar, and came across the Marina on the way. Gorgeous boats filled the view, pirate ships, day boats and fancy sea boats. There was also a celebration/ festival that we witnessed this evening also, which was amazing to see, the whole marina was full, flags everywhere and a large parade."
280,Not different from the others,"Lots of them in all shapes, types and sizes, masted and cruisers & the occasional cruise ship, if you like to admire them"
281,Mr Danny Tracy Bolton ,"We wandered across the sea front and over to the marina on a few nights during our trip to Marmaris. We found it beautiful walking along the promenade and watching the sea with an ice-cream. However once you get further along you start to become very hassled by restaurateurs trying to entice you into their establishment. The bazaar at the end is the same. In the end we went in one bar just to get some peace. The views are beautiful and we loved looking at all the yachts and fantasizing about who owned them and what it would be like to own one. Just be aware, it wont be a peaceful night until to choose a place to stop."
282,Lovely place tovidit,"I recommend everyone to go on this trip please use London eye travel marmaris (uncle John ) absolute legend . The boys on your trip will look after you incredibly please try you'll find that you'll absolutely love it fun ,lovely meal soft drinks included in price pay a bit extra for alcohol 5stops jump into green sea really invigorating my son's have autism and they loved it life jackets available for everyone if needed to swim in sea try guys ul enjoy trust me market with all your designer clothing to as one of the stops enjoy well worth it xx"
283,Marmaris and netsel matina,Beautiful setting shame its spoilt by the constant pestering of restaurant staff/boat owners who want your custom.
284,ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING ON!,Lovely day out on the glass bottom boat..didnt see much fish..But had a chance to dive into the sea..see different places of the island from phosphorus caves and a couple of other stops were we could have a swim..
285,Marmaris lovely place to visit ,"I'm writing this review about a year after visiting Marmaris Imperial hotel, not because I have anything negative to say, it's just that I have been on so many other holidays since visiting Marmaris that it has made me appreciate just how good it is. The food is amazing, we were well fed every night with fresh choices and a variety of different cuisines. Most nights had a theme of cooking and a chefs corner where they would prepare and cook the food in front of you. It was always lovely and a nice touch.The location is perfect, you have the choice of laying by a pool, sitting on a jetty or chilling on a private beach. We went in the height of August and there was always somewhere for us to sit, no matter what time we got up. We're not in to the whole - getting up early to reserve a sun bed - thing. So that worked well for us. If you're in to you water sports, there's plenty you can have a go at while you're there, obvioudly at an additional cost. We loved our holiday and this hotel and are hoping to return."
286,Wonderful ,The marineers were really helpful and friendly when we came in. They put the lines on for us. Good showers and recycling facilities. There is a nice pool where you pay 25tl to go in. There are good restaurants and shops on or near the marina. Very handy for getting into Marmaris.
287,Very tranquil...,Gill v . England hotel said 3 star but its not big let down never been to hotel like this ever.no one bother what things are like broken sun beda playes dishes . Bad food what u allready paid 4 in ur holiday booking. U have to pay extra to get food u can eat
288,Great hotel,The promenade around the marina seems to have had a facelift in the last few years and is looking even better than before. A lovely place for a stroll and don't be put off by all the restaurateurs trying to get you to dine with them or have a drink. They aren't too pushy and are just trying to make a living. A polite no works or even better go have that meal or drink I can't think of anywhere better.
289,Great City ,"Just returned after a week‚Äôs stay in Marmaris with my wife and son. Walking around the marina at anytime is worth it, but I would say at night it is even better, all the restaurants on the waters edge and plenty of boats to look at. The bazaar is just a stones throw away and also shops in the marina."
290,Daily visits to the Marina and the Siteler Marina,"If you do happen to wind up in marmaris , this is where I‚Äôd spend my time. Much cleaner and nicer outlook than the main town. There‚Äôs a little castle and lots of yachts to look at. The scenery is nice with plenty of dockside restaurants"
291,No time to get bored,Excellent would deffo b doing this again would reccomend Duran Duran private boat hire for just u and ur family as many swim stops as u want round the islands and Turunc and bbq on boat sleep overnight on the boat under the stars amazing
292,O'Hare family ,"We were staying a few miles out of Marmaris, but took a trip in one day to do the 'bazaar' thing and have a wander along the front. The beach gives way to a marina where all the touristy trips and local water taxis do their thing.Most surprisingly though, is carry on walking and around the corner is a lovely marina with boats you can only dream of owning, bars and restaurants by the dozen and some beautiful sculptures and public art. Such a relaxing place by day and the bar owners - like everyone we met - were happy, engaging and offered great value drinks and food.By night it is much much busier and we discovered that Bar Street is just behind too. No reason not to go though and it is a wonderful place to spend some time even if you are not out on the town.It seemed that everything was on offer, but not 'in your face' tourist noise and mayhem, rather a well managed area with something for everyone. We will be back - soon."
293,Very nice,"In the little time we had, just a day trip, Marmaris has left us all wanting to revisit. We had read reviews on Tripadvisor and weren't too sure what to expect but were really pleasantly surprised.Started our visit with a short walk from the port to the town, taxis are available from the port, which took us about 20 mins even though we weren't sure of the quickest route. The town is clean, the people very friendly and the food is an experience not to miss.We found a very nice restaurant to eat at and only paid 250 Turkish lira for 4 mains with drinks and coffee.Next to the bazaar area and we never got hassled once by the shop owners which really surprised us.We then made our way back to the port with a lovely stroll through the marina in the sun admiring the very large and expensive looking boats.If you get the opportunity to visit Marmaris don't pass it up, from our experience it's well worth it."
294,Busy Busy,"I was here because me and friend will take a week journey of sailing from Marmaris to Fethiye then back to Marmaris.For me it is a big port, modern, so clean, and lovely. I really like the ambiance, people hospitality, and many more.Thousand beautiful restaurants on the side makes you even wants to stay longer here.Also there is small market nearby the port that you can explore.1 more thing, make sure to grab some gelato that they sell around the port to accompany your day, its is so tasty and only cost 3 Turkish Lira."
295,Evening out,Walk that wayChallenge that bargaining restaurant / bar officers inviting you inSmell that airSpecially do this all in sundown ‚ù£Ô∏è
296,Marina,Due to Thomas Cook debacle Marmaris has lost 35000 holiday bookings in October. This is their last month before end of season. Because the holiday makers are not coming the Turkish shops have put their prices up to try and make up for the short fall. So be careful on price and be prepared to haggle harder or you‚Äôll end up paying over the odds for most things. I suppose this could apply to any holiday resort hit by Thomas Cook failure.
297,long walks,"From the feeling of loneliness, when arriving by sea, straight into the middle of the beehive, once at land. It has the second largest bazar after Istanbul, fancy restaurants all along the marina, jewelery shops and also authentic sportswear shops just 5 minutes distance from each other. The Marmaris fortress lies just above the marina."
298,Not impressed ,Plenty of rich aunties cruisers to seeGood choice if food and drinkShops to haggle inDown side is the amount of scooters on the pavements
299,Splendid destination,"Went on my bike down here-though you can't go all the way, which is a shame, though does give much privacy to those on the amazing boats i expect. However, its an amazing spectical. Approaching the Marina, its the usual Pirate, Diving, Tourist Boats ect... Then this turns into hundreds of amazing, off the scale boats. I'm not really a boat person, but i was in awe looking at some of the boats. There is also a section of posh shops in an area on its own, which is nice to walk through. Even though i haven't been there at night, the area leads onto a lot of quirky bars and is very much near the Grand Bazar. Very much worth a look round."
