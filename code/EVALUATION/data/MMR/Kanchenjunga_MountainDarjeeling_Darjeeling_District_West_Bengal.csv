0,Towering Presence Over Darjeeling.,"The Kanchenjunga mountain has a towering presence in Darjeeling. It is the main reason why Darjeeling, Gangtok and the surrounding areas of North Bengal and Sikkim get so many tourists. Kanchenjunga is the highest and most beautiful mountain peak in India, and the third highest in the world at 8586 meters. There are many viewpoints in Darjeeling from where we can get a fantastic view of the mountain on a clear day. The most popular of these places are Tiger Hill and Batasia Loop, and the best time is at sunrise when one can see the colours on the peak changing from red to pink to yellow and finally to white.We were lucky to get fabulous views of the entire Kanchenjunga range from Sandakphu, which is the highest peak in West Bengal, about 58 km from Darjeeling. The entire range is popularly referred to as the ‘Sleeping Buddha’ because of it’s appearance, with the head of the Buddha in the west and the feet in the east. Mt. Kumbhakarna forms the head and face, Mt. Pandim forms the feet and Mt. Kanchenjunga constitutes the belly of the Buddha."
1,Enchanting view.,The Kanchenjunga mountain is the most famous and attractive place of Darjeeling. It is foggy even in summer. The mountain is magnificent to view on a clear day. Trekking will be of great fun. The whole place is mesmerizing and very peaceful.
2,"Visit to Tiger Hill and Batasia Loop , Darjeeling",Kanchenjunga Mountain is the main attraction of Darjeeling. People come to Darjeeling especially to see Mount kachenjunga. It is a wonderful view when one watches Mount Kachenjunga in front of the eyes. It looks stunning and gorgeous when sun rises and rays of the light falls on the beautiful Kachenjunga.
3,Amazing view,"The Kanchanjunga mountain is the pull factor to most tourists visiting Sikkim and Darjeeling in particular. It is magnificent to view on a clear day from sunrise to sunset. But you have to be lucky as it can be foggy even in summer and the view of the mountain fogged. I went in late winter ( Feb 2017) and I was lucky to view the mountain from Pelling, Gangtok and Darjeeling. The best view was from Pelling and Tiger Hill during sunrise."
4,Location was great,With Darjeeling one thing that is synonymous is the Holy Kanchenjunga massif which can be seen clearly from the entire area .
5,Breathtaking view,Mt. KAnchenjunga is Highest Mountain in India and you can witness this beauty from Goechala and Green lake trek very closely

8,Wow! Himalayas for real.,"Peaks of mount Kanchenjungha can visible most part of Darjeeling. From tiger hills a beautiful view seen by tourist at early morning. Goden snow visible from here, from mall road view point silver color snow appear."
9,Amazing ,This is one of the most popular mountains of the himalayan range. This is best biewed from Darjeeling and tiger hill. But to have a clear sky its better to visit during the winter season.
10,Enthralling view from Darjeeling,From Darjeeling you can see the breathtaking view of Kanchenjunga mountains (highest mountain peak in India). I was spellbound when i saw this mountain for the first time during my visit to Darjeeling in Jan 2019. This is the top attraction of Darjeeling.
11,Majestic Himalayan Mountain,Kanchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world. The view of this mountain is clearly seen from the Tiger Hills view point in Darjeeling. Visited Darjeeling in the third week of March 2017. The scintillating view was fantastic. The snow on top was visible and it was an exciting view. Enjoyed with family and friends.
12,Kanchenjunga massive !!,"Kanchenjunga mountain is visible from entire darjeeling. view from tiger hill is the best, morning view is absolutely stunning - not to be missed."
13,Magnificent,Darjeeling famous for Mt. Kanchenjunga. If you are in Darjeeling you have to witness the majestic Himalayan mountain of Mt. Kanchenjunga.
14,Kanchenjunga,"The biggest attraction of Darjeeling is viewing the snow clad Kanchenjunga on a clear day. Nothing can match the experience, a must do for everyone."
15,Most Impressive,"The tallest montain in undisputed territory of India, Kanchenjunga is visible from almost every part of Darjeeling town, especially observatory hill, Hill Cart road, Chowrasta and Tiger Hill/Ghum"
16,Awesome view,This is one of the highest peaks in India - a scenic beauty of the Himalayan range and a famous view point of tourists.
17,Kanchenjunga ,The mountain view of kanchanjunga is just breathtaking from Darjeeling. The mountains are clearly visible and can be accessed from many locations.
18,Kanchenjunga Mountain,"Darjeeling offers unparalleled view of Mount Kanchenjunga , the highest peak in India and third highest in the world. view from near Railway station is beautiful ."
19,Magnificent,There are many great places in Darjeeling to view this. It is a spectacular mountain group on a clear day. From locals I gather you can get a clear view once monsoons are viewed...in the monsoon obviously views are unlikely...the best period would be the winter which starts from NovemberWe stayed on SingTom tea Estates and got great views from there but I noted you could on right day get great views from Darjeeling itself..Views seem present best in early morning before cloud cover springs up
20,The best view,"The majestic Kachenjunga is visible from all across Darjeeling. On a clear day, one can view the glistening peaks, as they change color from golden yellow, to white to blue."
21,Misty Day,"KANCHENJUNGA is the 3rd highest peak in the world situated in the Himalayan range. It s in between Nepal and Sikkim state of India. It's elevation is 8,586 meter ( 28,169 Ft.). The peak is always covered with snow. The first sun light on the snow white peak turns the peak marvelous with golden reflection. It is vissible from Darjeeling, Sikkim and Nepal."
22,Kanchenjunga mountain range,The best view of the kanchenjunga is from the small town  of peeling  near Darjeeling. One has to get up early in the morning around 4.30 or 5am  to get the bes view ofthe snow clad peak.But it's worth the pain; the view is worth. The biggest factor is the weather; in case of bad weather or clouds or rain there is a lot of fog and the view is not possible. So wish that weather gods are favorable when you are there.
23,Mount Kanchenjunga,This is the only great part of Darjeeling now and forever. The sheer majestic view of this range differentiates this mountain town from  all other hill stations in India. You have to see the peaks for yourself to appreciate  it's beauty.  Darjeeling  may be overcrowded  and dirty but this range compensates for all its faults.
24,Dipankar chakrabort,"People constantly talk about the view of Kanchenjunga from the tiger hill during sunrise and they flock to the spot in droves as if they can see God in being. But I feel and its my personal view that its a hype that is based more on hearsay. I donot mean that the Himalayas do not look good but at such distance it is not actually extraordinary. Most of the people who visit the spot to see the effect of sun's first rays falling on the snow clad mountain just come away thinking that they have seen something extraordinary. But the reality is that with the huge congregation gathering there, as if they are duty bound, its very difficult to have a great view. Moreover with modern gadgets like DSLRs and Smartphones in every hand, every Tom, Dick and Harry (this is not to denigrate anyone) considers oneself as a photographer of no mean ability and they raise their hands over their heads to catch the so called beautiful sight. What happens because of that is the view whatsoever is lost to almost everyone and almost nothing is left to see except slices of the snow covered range afar through the dense forest of several hands raised over heads and shoulders. After the visit, I would say it is better to see the mountain range from the window of the 3rd floor room of Hotel Sonar Bangla."
25,Spectacular viewing from Darjeeling,The Kanchanjungha Mountain Peak can be observed at a distance from Tiger Hill Observatory. The Golden Colour of Reflection of Sunlight mix with the silver lighting of Snow amazed the viewer.
26,Beautiful kanchendzonga,Kanchenjunga Mountain is a beautiful mountain in India located in Sikkim state. It is India's highest mountain.
27,Nice mountain if you can see it,Kanchenjunga can be seen from  virtually any part of Darjeeling. It is an awesome and awe inspiring sight and one never stops looking at it any time of the day.
28,The Mighty Kanchenjunga,"Khangchendzonga intense view can be seen from Darjeeling Mall aside. World's 3rd largest mountain which is lies in Nepal. This high altitude snow capped mountain is nearly 8,725 m is just when someone see it he forget everything, can't express how beautiful it is. You feel reconciliation in your mind. Just breathtaking spectacular view........Rezaur R."
29,Amazing View,The famous Kanchenjunga mountain is visible from anywhere on this road. Unfortunately we could not witness the Kanchenjunga because of cloudy weather for all three days of our stay. Avoid going to Darjeeling in June and July.
30,Depends on the day,The amazing view from Darjeeling specially from the Tiger Hills. You can see it perfectly the whole chain of mountains.
31,clouds,"Kanchenjunga, the 3rd highest peak in the world.The views of the mountain and the entire range are spectacular.Even the first sight of it makes you feel so proud.One of the most precious thing on earth, every time you see it you will fell in love with the view."
32,lovely is a small word,This is the third highest peak in the world and offers beautiful glimpses of its beauty from all over North Bengal and Sikkim. Its always covered with sparkling white snow and is main attraction of the region. It is a sacred mountain and has special relegious significance to the local population.
33,The Quintessential Bengali Dream of a Hill Station,"You will be able to see kanchenjunga mountain from many places in Darjeeling but the best view of it , you will get from the Tiger hill. It looks splendid from there. You will be able to see the first sunrise falling on kanchenjunga peak and that is just awesome."
34,View,"The Kanchenjunga - the biggest mountain of india - is impressive and a must-see when you visit Darjeeling. However it is not required to go to Tiger Hill if you just want to get a glimpse at it. When the sky is more or less clear you can see the icy-mountain from far. First we thought we only see clouds, before we could actually make out that we are looking right into the icy - top of this enormous mountain. Amazing."
35,simply great,very Beautiful view of Kanchenjunga mountain from Sikkim and Darjeeling also. just fantastic nothing more....
36,splendorous mesmerising sight of peak on flame or drenched in soft light of morning sun,its a main attraction of darjeeling. A clear view can make one mesmerized. Popularly known as 'sleeping budhha'... The view is really breath taking.

40,Amazing View,The view of the range is spectacular from the darjeeling railway station and one must see the place from the station and then Tiger Hills
41,The stunning golden shaded Kanchenjunga,This is the largest peak in India and looks beautiful during sunrise. What view of the snow covered peak with the sun shining on it in the morning.
42,Great experience,This is the third tallest mountain in the world . It is a part of the Himalayan mountain range and is located in the India-Nepal border.This gorgeous mountain can be visible from all the corners in Darjeeling ..But its beauty can be more visible in Sikkim ...The snow white capped Mt Kancgenjungha offers majestic view.
43,toy train,"it is visible and quite scenic from many of the rooms of darjeeling, even visible from sumit hotels the room provided for us"
44,Wow,Visible from many parts of North Bengal and Sikkim. But best we have seen from Tiger Hill. The typical shape of this peak is well recognised.
45,Fantastic experience of seeing the huge mountain,"Highest peak in India!Most major attraction of Northeast tour, which is at foot hill of MIGHTY KANCHGNJUNGA.  You need to b very fortunate to overcome cloudy whether God to see snow cap of majesty during this month. We were that fortunate to witness mesmerising snow caps from Pelling at very early morning. What a beauty!! We r not that fortunate at Gangtok. At Tiger Hill, lucky to have glimpose of majestic mountain. simply Spectacular!!"
46,Majestic Kanchenjunga - lucky all 3 days,"The highest mountain peak in India, Kanchenjunga and 3rd highest in the world is surely a delight to watch. We were not lucky to get the view from Gangtok due to bad weather and fog. But we got lucky in Darjeeling and had a clear view of the Himalayan range with Kanchenjunga standing tall. Darjeeling station offers a great view of the peak and you can also go to Batasia loop to get an amazing view. We took a steam train ride from Darjeeling station to Ghum which stops at Batasia loop for 10 mins. There are telescopes to watch the range and it is totally mesmerizing. No pictures will do justice to the view that you see."
47,A sighting of Kanchenjunga mountain is to die for,"Great experience to view this mountain covered with snow. We saw this mountain from pelling, gangtok, Namchi. Best view was from Temi tea garden and from Pelling Helipad..."
48,mountain,"Yes, Kanchanjangha is really beautiful. We enjoyed the beauty of Kanchanjangha from our hotel, Mall road, Batasia loop and finally from tiger hill. Sometimes due to fog, it is not visible properly. It's totally upto luck."
49,Mountain view from hotel,The beauty of Mount Kanchenjunga is amazing. Excellent view is also available from the zoo. The snow caps add to its beauty.
50,Darjeeling and West Bengal,It is a point from one can view Kanchanjunga Peak on clear sunny days. It has shops selling souvenirs & other itmes.Near parking you can take a street foods etc.
51,Stunning in early morning,If u visit Darjeeling during summer u will be Able to see Kanchenjunga from various places of Darjeeling. During winter due to fog the visibility is too low so u won't get to see any glimpse of Kanchenjunga.
52,It is really a splendid view.,"The third highest mountain in the world and the highest one in India, Kanchenjunga has five high peaks visible on a clear sky from the Mall Road next to the Raj Bhavan in Darjeeling. The entire appearance is so majestic and sombre that the visual experience often transcends to a trance. The proverbially spoilsport clouds and mists are generally week during mid October- mid November. However, with luck on your side you can enjoy the view on any day or on a full moon night. The sunrise hours or the sunset hours certainly are special but the broad daylight views are also very beautiful. A few hotels located just below the road or the Tourist Lodge above might provide a 24X7 view from the indoors. Long walks and occasional rest on the roadside gazebos lift your spirits above the mundane matters when Kanchenjunga glitters in sunlight or glows in moonlight, as the case may be."
53,The beautiful white Kanchanjangha,"Among Greenery of Darjeeling and Sikkim, suddenly you will notice White Snow Laden Mountains and that's the Beauty of Kanchenjunga. They can be distinguished with their Colour easily and you will just say Awesome..."
54,View from Tiger hill,On clear day u can see from darjeelingenjoy the sun shine and make different colours in the peaks mountains
55,Excellent,"Kangchenjunga, also spelled Kanchenjunga, is the third highest mountain, and lies partly in Nepal and partly in India. It rises with an elevation of 8,586 m (28,169 ft) in a section of the Himalayas called Kangchenjunga Himal. When seen from Darjeeling it comes up as a massif containing 7 peaks. The view is probably one of the best Mountain Vista from India. From undulating mountains covered with jungles and tea garden the Majestic peaks kiss the sky. They keep on changing color from sunrise to sunset with the cloud cover adding up the mood."
56,Tiger Hill,The plume of the Kanchenjunga is very imposing.The post sinrise view is the best with the sun reflecting of the snow.
57,Wildy beautiful,A view of kanchanjanjunga was memory for ever. It was very lovely. The beautifull snowy mountain won my heart.
58,Kanchenjunga Mountain,Sunrise on the snow-topped Kanchenjunga is breathtaking. You can relate it to sunset at Kanyakumari. The golden shining rays take over the mountain. A short-lived memorable moment.Start early if you have the plan to visit sunrise. heavy traffic on the way to tiger hill and unruly driver who parked the vehicle on the narrow road. You can have a great view only if the weather is clear.
59,the best view point from the mall,"What a mountain range!! The only and only positive plus point of Darjeeling is this huge mountain, covered in snow almost all throughout the year. If you are lucky, you will get to see it standing bright just as the sun's first rays hit it! A must see attraction from any possible point if in Darjeeling."
60,Tiger Hills a Must do in Darjeeling,"Kanchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world, and lies partly in Nepal and partly in Sikkim, India. It rises with an elevation of 8,586 m and this is the second highest mountain of the Himalayas. Kanchenjunga Main is the highest mountain peak in India and has always been worshiped by the people of Darjeeling and Sikkim.The view of whole Kanchenjunga Mountain range is spectacular from Darjeeling as well as from Gangtok. View from Pelling is nearer like touchable."
61,Mighty mountains,Different view from Darjeeling as compared to the Sikkim views. The golden hues seen at sunrise is unique.
62,sleeping buddha.,"The view of Kanchenjunga Mountain Ranges form Tiger Hills is the best, you can view the full range at the time of sunrise, the view of the snow peaks when first sun rays fall is the best , the mountain converts to gold and slowly the sun rays spread around the ranges in no time."
63,excellent,View of Kanchenhunga is really amazing and most beautiful thing at Darjeeling. I would suggest ne must start from Hotel at 3:30 AM if they don't want to miss the Sun Rise. We got little late and missed the Sun Rise. Although views are also very good. Lot of time is required due to traffic jams on the way.
64,Awesome view of kanchanjunga,The third highest peak in the world is on display in all it’s grandeur from Darjeeling. We were there late November and it was clear every morning til about 11am when the clouds start rolling in.  The view is then obscured until the next morning.  Take the pedestrian loop leading to the mall at sunrise. The peaks are revealed to u in a magical way. A better view than Tiger Hill without the crowds and pickpockets. U just st don’t get to see both the sun and the peak together like u do at Tiger Hill.
65,Once in a lifetime experience!,"You cannot rate Kanchenjunga mountain. It is heavenly and out of he world. But to get a view of the mountain anytime in May to Aug , you have to be a very lucky person. If you want to get a view of this beautiful peak from Darjeeling , you have to be there in Nov or Dec or Jan where you have much better chance. The rating is all about the frustration of not being able to get the view during my visit in May. I have seen it many a times in the past. When you know how great it is , you tend to miss it badly."
66,Majestic Kanchenjunga Mountains,One of the prettiest mountain ranges in India a visit to Darjeeling and higher offers you various glimpses of the Kanchenjunga range. Best time is to catch it during sunrise as the mountain range changes colours with the rising sun.
67,Majestic ,"A thrill to watch on a clear day. The range includes peaks like Kanchenjunga, Mt. Kaburu, Kumbhkaran, Pandim etc."
68,An enriching experience,I visited Gangtok and Darjeeling and was able to see Mt Kanchenjunga (8586mt) from both the placesTo see the Mt Kanchenjunga the weather has to clear with no clouds and there are few places/view points from where you can see the third highest peak in the world
69,A wonderful scene to see !!,Kanchenjunga mountain was totally covered with snow because I visited this place in November and it was very cold. View of the mountain was just unforgettable.
70,The king of valley,"The trip to Darjeeling is partly to see the majestic Kanchenjunga, second only to the mighty Everest. But, to catch a glimpse of all the peaks, one has to be extremely lucky. Most of our views were clouded by misty mornings and afternoons. The walk on observatory hill also provided only a clouded view. I guess June is not the Ideal time for observing the peak"
71,The unforgettable view,"The mesmerizing view of sunrise from Tiger hill and its effect on the mighty Kanchenjunga is a lifetime achievement. The color of the mountain turns to pink, then orange before the sunrise and all day glitter all white is a great experience to watch."
72,Wonderful Scenic View of Mt. Everest & Kanchenjunga,The view of kanchenjunga is really mesmerizing and in order to vie the mountains you have to get up at 3:00. The first ray of sunshine make this place worth admiring.
73,Sandakhpu in West Bengal for the best view of Kanchenjunga ,We were fortunate to see the mountain from Gangtok and Darjeeling. Lovely and majestic. Had nice weather blessed us Both hotels we were able to see the mountain from of hotel bed. It is a must see.
74,Beautiful ,"View of this beautiful mountain is available from Sterling Darjereling, but the best view point for it is TIGER POINT."
75,View Of Kanchenjunga from Darjeeling,"The best view point of Kanchenjunga from the mall is from this place, located in front of Hotel Retreat and very close to Mayfair hotel. On a clear day, the view is excellent and pretty close-up. Some other view points from the mall are not as good since they have been enclosed with wire netting"
76,Worth watching ,"The mountain stands at an altitude of 8586 meters, and is the highest peak in India, and third highest mountain in the world.Some of the famous views of Mount Kangchenjunga are from the hill station of Darjeeling. The Darjeeling War Memorial is one of the most visited places to watch the Mount Kanchenjunga.Visit at Darjeeling will never guarantee you of full visibility of the mountain, as during April-May and Monsoonal seasons heavy clouds blocks the vision, however the possibility is much greater during winter months.Tiger hill near Darjeeling is another place to find a great view of Kangchenjunga."
77,Amazing amazing view,"Darjeeling the queen of mountains . But the queen of queens is the Kanchenjuga . You can look at her beauty , her curve , the secret in her eyes . This mountain has a magic , a charm ."
78,Mrs,"The charming view of Kanchenjunga is more beautiful from Batasia Loop than Tiger Hills. From Batasia Loop we see the mind capturing scene of Kanchenjunga, Indo China border, Indo Nepal border etc. At Tiger Hills, the view is colourful. The Kanchenjunga Peaks glitter with yellow, light red colour from the rays of sun before it's rise, a magnificent view."
79,Different View of Kanchenjunga Range,"Mount Kanchenjunga can be viewed from Tiger hills, Tashi view point, Ganesh tak, Batasia loop and several other places in Dargeeling. It can be seen only on a clear day."
80,Beautiful view of Kanchenjunga from Darjeeling,View of kanchanjangha is best observed from ghoom. Colour changes with sun dawn and sun set. Must go to Tiger hill for spectacular sun rise.

82,Heaven in the earth.....,"I spent time in Gangtok and saw Kanchenjunga in all its beauty daily. However, in Darjeeling, during the winter months overcast skies make viewing impossible."
83,Kanchenjunga Range,"Majestic, Mighty, Magnum opus of darjeeling...a glimpse of this snow laden peak is what travellers in darjeeling die for....if ur lucky wid the weather the view of this mountain will leave upon you an everlasting impression"
84,The awesome height of Kanchenjunga Mountain and sunrise seen from Tiger Hill,"Kanchenjunga is situated in Nepal-India border. As a matter of fact, as it lies in both countries. The center, main and south peaks are situated in Taplejung, Nepal while the north peak lies in Sikkim India. A portion of the region is also shared with Bhutan.As I'm a serious Himalaya lover and see many of world's snow peaked mountain, Mt Kanchenjunga among my favourite. I saw this beauty from Taplejung of Nepal, Namchi, Sikkim and Kalimpong and Darjeeling of West Bengal, India.But it is worldwide famous for beautifully seen and best viewed from Darjeeling.I've been there many times, but never felt satisfy viewing Kanchenjunga from various points of Darjeeling.Same in my last visit there in October."
85,beautiful views!,"On a clear day, one can get beautiful sightings of this exquisite site from many points in Darjeeling and Sikkim. We were lucky to see this beautiful Himalayan peak from many points on our trip. However, the best view we got was the Peace Pagoda in Darjeeling .We also got a good view of it from our hotel in Gangtok and from the Barfung Retreat in Sikkim."
86,Amazing mountain scapes with Adventures unlimited ,"Whole range facing northern part of Darjeeling, present loveliest view.

99,View to die for,Although kanchanjaga mountain view is awesome but because of weather it is difficult to see. If the weather is clear this is the best view i must say...
100,Cloudy weather disappointed us,It's so good to see such a big and tallest mountain peak in India and snow looks so beautiful and good...
101,Awesome View,sunrise view from Kanchenjunga is awesome. you have to reach tiger hill by morning 4am so you can see the sunrise from der.

104,A wonderful sight to behold!!!!-Sun is reborn here every morning:),"It is the 5th highest peak in the world, situated in the Himalayas.

On our first and third day the weather was great and we enjoyed the view of the mountain, however the second day was cloudy, rainy and windy and visibility was down.Darjeeling is one of the prettiest places that I had been to in my lifetime."
108,One glimpse and you will keep coming back,we visited recently tiger hill in 10th to 15th no any viewing of Kanchenjunga mountain from any places of darjeeling.... because this time always very very cloudy wheter.. pl... inquire first whether of darjeeling & Gangtok in this time ..  we are very nervous & experienced a big bad luck
109,Mesmerizing View,view from this mountain from all the sikkim is very great. want to go nearby and spent some time over there.
110,Distance view ,It is my luck that as many times I visited Sikkim or Darjeeling almighty god never disappointed me from the view of Mt. Kanchendzonga. The beauty of this Mt. and Sunrise on this is just something which I can not explain in words. For me in short Mt. Kanchendzonga is Inexpressible Beauty. It is truly Sleeping Buddha.
111,Heighest Indian Mountain,"i back again and again for this mountain.tiger hill and that is the main attraction of here,you cant eyes back from here.it is full of snow,reflection of light is so nice here."
112,View and enjoy,Recommend taking in the views of Kanchenjunga from the historic Darjeeling train station and getting up extra early to see it the at sunrise from Tiger Hill.

116,Finally saw the snow covered Kanchenzonga,The view of Kangchenjunga is breathtaking and it transports you to another world all together! We stayed at dreamland hotel and got the perfect view. Hotels near rajbhavan or the Mahakal temple route is an ideal place to stay and view Kangchenjunga in early morning.
117,nature is almighty,a sun set or sun rise at kanchanjunga view point will give you a everlasting imprint of life for beauty
118,Nice view,"I have not submitted Kangchenjunga, but seen it plenty from the Darjeeling and Singhalila Ridge region. When the clouds are low (quite often) the land looks green with the cloud, you could be anywhere and then there's a break in the clouds and it is jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring.  The white-capped 8586m-tall rock is imposing over all other peaks in that massif, and if you look slightly to the south early in the morning you can also see Everest and Lhotse. A must see."
119,Good viewing spot near Mayfair,No words can express the joy of seeing beautiful snow capped mountains.. Clearly visible from Darjeeling itself on a clear day.
120,Kanchenjunga View,"We Group of 13 people all across the world went on trekking to Sandakphu in Eastern Himalaya. We started our journey from quaint village of Jaubari, West Bengal on foot. We  started seeing Mount Kanchenjunga from the Day 1. The views are magnificent. The sunrise & sunset on Kanchenjunga is extremely amazing and changing the colours of the peak. Its an awesome experience. We have been trekking for 6 days in mountain and all the days we were walking side by side to mighty Kanchenjunga. The whole experience of trekking with a view of whole Sleeping Buddha Range is memorable."
121,What s sight!,We were lucky during our Darjeeling stay that we the weather permitted direct view of Kanchanzunga from the city itself. We could see it from our hotel room balcony.
122,Mystic Peak and visible from many parts of Sikkim and during Treks,The experience of Kanchenjunga Mountain view from telescope from Batasil in the morning was clear and great view.
123,Breadthaking glimpse of the peaks,"Sunrise Tour to Tiger Hill – situated at an altitude of 2590 meters (8482 ft.) and 13 kms from the town, this spot has earned international fame for the magnificent view of the sunrise over ""Kanchendzonga"" and the great Eastern Himalayan Mountains"
124,The Mighty Mountains!!,Got up at 4.30 AM to go to Tiger Hill to see the sun rise over the Kanchenjunga.Actually the sun rose over an adjacent peak but the sun lit the Kanchenjunga much before the sun rise over the adjacent peak. A crowd gathered there watched in awe as the Kanchenjunga went from dim to pale to pinkish and then the sun was glimpsed over the adjacent peak as we watched mesmerized! Beautiful and breathtaking nature--- a truly humbling experience!
125,The Sleeping Buddha,"Rose at 4am to watch the sun rise over Sikkim, Nepal and Bhutan from Tiger mountain in Darjeeling. A truely memorable experience including a ten minute glimpse of Kanchenjunga Mountain. Being January they're was a sharp frost but only a few thousand tourists. The 5,000 seater observatory should be fun when finished."
126,mesmerizing,It’s long way to reach there to see this huge mountain. We took Jeep taxi 150rp from siliguri to Darjeeling for 3hrs.I think we don’t have any place in the world like Darjeeling where we can see 8000m mountain without climbing.
127,great natural veiw,"What can someone say or comment about Kanchenjungha....which in itself is such a beauty that from all over the world people come to catch a glimpse of it or to capture it within the frames.Its beauty,grandeur,majestic temperament and its view which can only be caught by the fortunate few that too may b after several failed attepts,all this makes it a self proclaimed and unanimously accepted beauty."
128,Snow peaks covered in the clouds,We were fortunate enough to get a clear view of the Kanchenjunga range from tiger hills as this and sunrise can be seen subject to availability of clear weather.
129,Spellbound view of this mountain.,I have traveled form Mumbai so it was a very nice experience to see a mountain covered with snow the best time and place to see the mountains is tiger point and during the sunrise
130,Excellent view,"Snow-capped, beautiful views from Tiger Hill, definitely a must if you are in Darjeeling. Great spot for pictures but a little chilly at the observation deck. We went at around 9am instead of 5am so there was a bit of mist but still had a great view"
131,Not preferable in summer,"Kanchenunga is alteast 100 km from this place, but still is clearly visbile from every where provided the weather if clear."
132,The majestic Kanchenjunga,"The beauty of the 3rd highest mountain range in the world is to be seen to be believed.On a clear day its a lifetime experience watching the sun rise early in the morning.Sometimes silver, at times golden and sometimes orangish red Kanchenjunga has captured the heart of millions of nature and mountain enthusiasts!!"
133,Majestic,I can not believe that I have gone to kanchenjunga.the highest Hil in India.It is a dream when I go there frist time I show the ice..
134,tiger hill,"We got excellent view of Kanchenjunga at sunrise from Tiger Hill , and the same day, from Batasia Loop, Darjeeling. It was a life-time experience."
135,Want to go there once,ow my god this was a amazing experience of mine to see kanchenjungha from tiger hill..as well as sun rising..its can't b explained by words... I was just speechless.. evry one should visit this placw
136,Omg,"The view is breathtaking! A walk on the Hill Cart Road in Darjeeling is the best way to take in the views. The skies were cloudy, and there was no view on one of the two days we were in Darjeeling."
137,Phenomenal..!!,The best attraction here. 3d highest peak. seeing it early morning is fascinating with sun light on the mountain snow.
138,A Great Sight,We saw this majestic peak on our trek to base camp of the HMI. the peak is really good being the 3rd highest in the world but requires a very tough skill level to climb. I wish i climb it one day
139,Sleeping Buddha - Kanchenjunga Mountain Range,"Could not enjoy the view on our first two days on trip, but after that, the Kanchenjunga followed us everywhere we go at Darjeeling. Yes, you can see it from almost every corner of the city. Best view is on full moon nights. Just loved it"
140,Wow!,We visited and saw the Sunrise form Tiger Hill at 4.30AM. Amazing view of Sunrise and the sunrays falling and changing colours on Kanchenjunga peak
141,At sunrise,Being on the hill top and getting a clear view of range of snow covered mountains is also a luck. Stunning views and natural beauty will fill every heart.
142,Couldnt see from the Tiger hill because of clouds and poor visibility.,One can see this majestic mountain only if the weather is clear and if there are no clouds. Otherwise it is entirely covered by clouds. There are 5 key peaks with the main peak rising tall at 8586 meters - the highest in India and the third highest in the world after Everest and K2
143,Stunning beyond words!,We could see the Himalayas from our hotel room.  But nothing compares to the view we had of Kanchenjunga as the sun rose.  We sat in wonder looking out of our window as we took breakfast.  Snow topped peaks glistening in the light.  Forever will be a talking point.
144,Awesome,No speech to describe or to pen down my feelings for this mighty range.Huge mighty and beautiful kanchenjanga  is the love of all people of Bengal ...i suppose
145,Sunrise over Kanchenjunga.,Just came down to plains and missing Kanchenjunga। Weather remains bit unpredictable but whenever there is no cloud Kanchanjunga with mesmerize you with its beauty। Morning around 5.30-6am it wears a golden overcoat.. then it starts dressing up in her white gown as the sun comes up. I just felt like sitting and staring at its beauty. I was lucky enough to be there during Holi ....so I even got lucky to witness the full moon above the kanchenjunga. It's a lifetime experience for me
146,MESMERISING,"If you want to see the kanchenjunga in the morning go in october,novemner as in summer most of the time weather remains cloudy and you will not get the clear view of the mountain and you will disappoint and regret to woke up early in the morning."
147,My first glimpse of the Himalayas,We were really lucky to get a clear and marvelous view of the Mighty Kanchejunga form the garden area of Darjeeling Tourist lodge early morning. One would like to sit and keep watching the mountains the whole day.
148,In the Lap of Himalayan Mountains!!,View  from the tiger hill is awesome in the dawn hours alongwith the sunrise.It surely changes a couple of colours.
149,Mesmerizing place,I think view of this mountain in pic doesnt justify its magic...when i see this mountain vie on pic..i didnt impress..but whe i see it real from batsia loop ...i promise you guy that you wll never forget this view...kanchenjunga mountain is best seen from tiger hill and batasia loop
150,A day in Darjeeling ,"Our family spent a week in West Bengal visiting Kalimpong, Darjeeling, Ging Tea Estate and a few places in between. We drove from Bagdogra airport to Kalimpong and had great river and mountain views despite some rain. We were in Kalimpong 2 nights and enjoyed a day hike nearby to a farm stay through a local village. While it was The morning of our second day we could see many parts of Kanchejunga from our hotel.  We then drove to Darjeeling and caught more views of Kanchenjunga and the Himalayas on the border of Sikkim. In Darjeeling we did some local walks and were lucky to stay near the Mall where you can see many of the Himalayan peaks over 8,000 meters. The zoo is beautiful with many local animals that live in the region like red pandas, snow leopards, and blue sheep.  We also visited Ging Tea Estate and enjoyed a tour of the tea factory, enjoyed hikes, the views, and the food."
151,The snow-clad peaks follow you wherever you go,This December in clear sunny day glimpses of Kanchenjunga over white cloud river was an mesmerized moment..
152,Sleeping Buddha,definitely worth seeing! Beautiful views of the world's third largest peak from Darjeeling. Very awe-inspiring.
153,Amazing view,"This is rated as the best spot in Darjeeling, without doubt. However, we were unfortunate to not get the best of views on all 3 days of our trip there mainly because of hazy weather. The place was visible from my Hotel and  would be at the balcony every day early in the morning. Still, I was not fortunate enough to have the best of views."
154,Kanchenjunga,"(Sep 2014) We took a toy train ride from Darjeeling till Ghum. On its way, when it halted at Batasia garden we were busy in clicking some pics and then suddenly it appeared out of nowhere. It's beyond words to explain how ecstatic and fortunate I felt :-)Truly a wonder sight!!!!"
155,It’s huge and high enough,"Awesome vie of kanchanjunga you will get it from tiger point, but for that you will have to go early in the morning at 4-4:30, if you are late it will be too crowded to get place to stand or sit,Let me tell you it is worth visiting tell"
156,Majestic Majesty,"The most humbling peak, when you see the rising sun playing with colors on the Sleeping Buddha, you can't move your eyes, you can't think anything else"
157,Highest peak of India,You will never forget your view of the highest mountains of the world ( Everest is there on the side but the spectacle is Kanchenjunga
158,Breathtakingly beautiful,Himalaya or home of Lord Buddha and shiva.there is eternity peace and sound of ohm is produced. Best time to see whole range is on November
159,Great,On a clear day the view here is spectacular and well worth the visit. There are benches along the walk from chowrasta where you can sitr and just gaze at6 the mountains
160,Sunrise,"I cannot describe in words what it felt like seeing mount Kanchenjunga with snow capped peaks shining in the light of Sun. I have just one word to describe it best and its ""Mesmerizing""."
161,Main attraction in sikkim and north bengal,one must see the toyoal engine train very heritage. a visit to darjeeling town would be interesting.View of kanhanjunga from tiger hill early morning is superb
162,Excellent View ,"Of all the mountains I have seen, Kanchenjunga is by far the most symmetrical mountain i have ever seen. You can view the mountain from a lot of places in Darjeeling. At different times of the day with daylight at different places, the mountain looks splendidly different."
163,Breathtaking!,Truly heaven and peace can be achieved by visiting this place .Can get a nice view in Nov to april.sure visit to the place
164,Upgraded to attic room which had phenomenal views.,It's always a beauty. What a magnificent look and beauty it has. Always get crazy to see the mountain.
165,Majestic,This is a very moody mountain. One requires real luck to glimpse it's much praised glory. If seeing the Kanchenjunga is the only objective of the trip to Darjeeling then it's a big gamble especially during March.
166,A mystical wonder,We visited the tiger hill which was under reconstruction at that time and could not get the view. But on a sunny day this is visible from the Mall and we were lucky in that aspect
167,Saw Kanchenjnga from 3 different locations,"Lucky to have seen the majestic Kanchenjunga all 3 days of my stay in Djg ,,,woke up early morning to capture golden hues of first sun rays on the snow capped peaks...amazing feeling"
168,Sanju ,The place is very is very much charming. The place is very cold. The most important thing is you need to get up early in the morning.
169,quite scenic,Breathtaking to see on a good clear day.  One of the 'must see' sights of India and great test of cameras.
170,Amazing Mountains,Visited the location for the sunrise apart from the freezing temperatures (as per bombay standards) at 4 am the sun rise view is just stunning and worthed.
171,The Holy Mountain of Sikkim,Great experience to see the whole range on the morning of 3rd day of the Darjeeling tour on 2nd week of october 2016. First 2 days were washed off due to rain and fog. The main attraction of Darjeeling.
172,My mountain my soul,Saw it from Phalut after Sandakphu on the Sandakphu trek. Quite distant but impressive.Then saw it from Darleeling.The saw it from Goechala Viewpoint 1 at sunset with the sun shining on it. Best.This is the nearest one can get to Kanchenjunga from the Indian side since beyond it is prohibited
173,Amazing to watch!!!,"It's a bit funny to review a mountain range, but the Kanchenchunga or the Kangchen Dzo-nga - and her attendant peaks - well, it's really no wonder people go crazy! She shows a different mood every hour, and the different colours - pink, orange, white, off white, pale yellow - reflect that. Best place to watch this mountain deity is anywhere from Gangtok and elsewhere in the state; visible through the day. And you don't need to go to any specific view point as such. Just walking around gives you great views, given the height. I know Darjeeling has a reputation because of Ray's film; but it's really quite misted over except in some seasons (again, as in the film), and there are so many hotels now that their roofs block the view even when it's clear. Sikkim is better; that's been our experience at least."
174,Awsome view,"After staying a night in Darjeeling we got up very early for the trip you Tiger Hill, I was sceptical of the idea and wasn't impressed by the 3:00 am wake up call! But the moment the sun began to rise over the mountains I knew this was something special. Seeing the black sky slowly reveal the mountains is something I will never forget. I was in awe of the magnitude and clarity of the mountain, with photos doing no justice to the view! To add to the most magical experience of my life we were able to see Everest off in the distance."
175,Beauty to behold,"Often covered by cloud - when this majestic peak comes out for the show - the view is amazing.  Hopefully, you're able to get a peak."
176,Splendid View.  My salutation to Mother Nature ,We visit Darjeeling in August 2019 . August is monsoon season but  the weather was  good with only some showers. We got view of kanchenjunga Mountain from terrence of our Hotel. Mind blowing view . A huge mountain cover with snow . Wonderful experience.
177,Mighty Kanchenjunga,We had a clear view of the range this monsoon from the view point next to the Governor's house. We were there at 6.30 am in the morning and till 7.30 am the view was absolutely clear.
178,WOW! WOW! WOW!,On clear days you can see it from the view point.The colours are so beautiful.You will definitely remember it for a long time.Nature's beauty.
179,Darjeeling means Kanchenjunga !,A beautiful view. One must visit this place. View is only possible on clear weather. So visit as per weather condition.
180,Mountain that reboot daily,"Excellent mountain range. Must watch at the time of sunrise when slowly the sunlight starts falling in the mountain range. If you are staying in West Bengal Tourism Lodge, then from the lodge itself you can visit the sunrise falling in the mountain."
181,Trekking Singalia ridge,"You can get a view of the Kanchenjunga from almost anywhere, I had it from my hotel room in Ghoom, subject to condition the day is clear. Tiger Hill is supposed to be the best place to get a great view."
182,Mesmerizing,"It's a full treat view if weather permits to watch you Kanchenjunga.We stayed 3 Nts in Gangtok and 2 Nts in Darjeeling but were able to watch Kanchenjunga peak only 2 times,once in Gangtok on a clear early morning from our hotel lobby (Nettle and Fern) and twice in Darjeeling from Tiger Hill early morning.But view of Snow capped Kanchenjunga is a mesmerising feeling which you can feel only after watching."
183,"While we had visited some places locally, they didn""t interest much.","We stayed in Ramada, Gandhi Road in Darjeeling and the best part was that we opted for the Kanchenjunga view room.Believe me it was magical when we caught the first glimpse of Kanchenjunga.We use to admire it in the mornings while having a cup of tea and were awestruck.Don’t know why but it hit me spiritually as well. After looking at it for sometime I always got a feel of refreshment as if I was meditating."
184,The Great Himalayas - Kanchenjunga Mountain,Awsum view from my hotel of kanchenjunga mountain..mesmerising view..feel the magnificent himalayan range..breathtaking lifetime view experience..
185,Gorgeous,"If you hasn't seen it yet from Sikkim or Darjeeling, your life is Incomplete.Heavenly SIGHT to behold. <3  <3  <3"
186,Out of this world,One of the most spacious place to ever stay in Pelling. One of the best hotel  to ensure Kanchenjunga Early Morning View. Hotel staffs are very caring and sincere. Mr. Akarun Das is very professional and highly customer oriented. Mr. P.K.Mandal is very particular about ensuring highest standard of hospitality services to guests. Highly satisfying experience. They even woke us up early morning at 4am so that we do not miss Kanchanjunga View from hotel window.
187,Excellent....,"Saw it from various points. From Sandakpu was the best. Sleeping Buddha-- Kumbhakaran as nose and face, Kanchenjunga as body. Understand not been climbed to summit (but only to 5 ft. below summit) to respect religious sentiments since treated as a sacred mountain. Said to be ven more difficult to climb than Everest. On a clear day can pan left to see Everest, Lhotse and Makalu too"
188,Mountain peak,Well in the morning when sky was clear we had and absolutely spectacular view of this third tallest mountain of the world. So delightful to have that view ...
189,Words Fail  To Describe Kanchendzjongha's Beauty,"What a gorgeous and heavenly mountain range. Is it a silver lining? or gold lining? when the first Sun rays fall on it and lines the entire range.Our father said, it is can be described as mighty and most beautiful white snow-laden {section of Himalayan} mountain range, and golden mountains with silver lining! depending on the time of the day one sees it.The view is worth perhaps heaven on Earth! and Sikkim with it's clean surroundings and majestic trees, hills and valleys adds more to the experience like nowhere visible perhaps."
190,An Amazing sight.,I had viewed Kanchenjunga 4/5 times before. But in May - during my visit the view we had was the best. The view was there for a good 4 hours with 100% visibility. The best so far in my life
191,The golden mountain,"We stayed in Darjeeling @ Khush Alaya, A Sterling Holidays Resort from 9th to 12th March and had a wonderful memorable time.The best part of this resort is the direct view it provides to Mount Kanchenjunga and the adjoining range of Himalayas. We were also allotted a room from where, just by stepping out we could view the imposing Himalayan range.Unfortunately on 10th Morning, a large cloud blocked the view of Mount Kanchenjunga, while allowing us to view the adjoining Mount Kumbhakarna and Mount Kabru S. On 11th it was raining heavily and the entire valley/Darjeeling was under a cloud cover. We were leaving on 12th Morning and as soon as I woke up at around 5-15 AM I went out of my room and lo behold there was entire range including Mount Kanchenjunga for me to view. From that time till around 7 AM (when we left the Resort), I clicked over 270 photos of the enchanting view and I am sharing a few of those snaps."
192,Beautiful must visit,The mountain can be seen from the Mall but the day has to be clear.Be choosy about weather.Very majestic beautiful and serene Mountain .
193,Home of Lord Buddha and Shiva,"This was about 3 mins walking distance from Mayfair hotel. Seeing this mountain depends on the weather. More often than not it is clouds, fog or mist which covers this snow capped mountains. We did a bit of this view..however we saw it very clearly from Gangtok..on the way to Tsomgo lake."
194,Kanchanjungha Mountain peak ,We were in Darjeeling and Kalimpong for eight days and glimpsed the high Himalaya twice.  The air was full of pollution and I suspect that these days it's a rare thing to actually see the mountain range.  We were very disappointed.  But the one time we did see the mountains it was fantastic.  Lower your expectations big time if you are going to Darjeeling and/or Kalimpong. You mightn't see the mountains at all.  We visited at what is supposed to be the best time of year and we hardly saw a thing.
195,Kanchenjunga views,This was the best thing for me. Hotel was nightmare. But after watching Kanchanjunga all my anger was soon disappeared I just loved it.
196,"Stunning mountain, awesome","Wow, is the immediate word in mind after sudden appearance of kanchanjanga . Amazing experience. But can only see if weather supports and no fog"
197,Kanchenjunga Mountain from Tiger Hill,"I spent two days at Pelling to see this fasinating Peak and other mountains adjacent. The first day it was cloudy but by night it cleared to certain extent. Even in the dim light the mountain shimmered and glowed. The next day it was clear and what a sight it was. Majestic, beautiful and awesome!!"
198,Breathtaking View,"Dont have another word then ""Majestic"". It can be clearly viewed from Hanuman Tok, Ganesh Tok, Tashi View points in Gangtok city and Pelling District of Sikkim."
199,Majestic Beauty!!,"When we reached Darjeeling sun was shining and it looked a great day ahead. But in the evening while we were strolling at Mall Road it started raining and a mild snow fall. We reached hotel completely drenched and were worried for the day ahead and thought the tour has gone waste.Woke up next morning at around 6.00 in the morning, removed the curtains and just could not believe myself, Mount Kanchenjunga was standing in front of me in pink colour and the roofs, ground covered in a  white sheet of snow. I woke up my wife and we both were flabbergasted, mesmerised, awestruck with beauty of Kanchenjunga.You have to see the peaks for yourself to appreciate it's beauty."
200,Snow on Top ,"We had nice view of Kanchenjunga, Good time to visit is April to June. Had good time with family in the snow."
201,Beautiful range of mountains,All you compromise is early morning sleep to be at tiger hills but it will cover your compromise in no time with sunrise! you can see from very beautiful golden sun rays covering beautiful Kanchanjunga mountain! it was mesmerising & eternal peaceful experience!
202,View of kanchenjunga from tiger hill sinrise,"Only got to see the views of this beautiful mountain, but oh what is she a beauty. Best seen from my experience from the gondolier lift near gangtok. Do give her a visit, she is worth it."
203,Magnificient,I went in may 2017 .but it seems to be rainy and foggy season in Darjeeling. So I didn't saw snow capped kanchenjunga
204,Hard to believe it was real and not a postcard,"To enjoy the sunrise you must visit in April-May and you will get the clear view and blue sky. If you get the clear view, you can see the three picks are arranged in a way that looks like lord Budha is sleeping."
205,No View in 3 Days,"View of Kanchenjunga is an experience worth going through again.During my next visit, would like to spend more time enjoying the beauty of this magnificent mountain."
206,Goecha-la,"I feel nice when I watch my captured images of Kanchenjunga. It is not a matter of promoting myself, it is just a feelings. Oh oh great. I request everyone at least once in a lifetime must to see this great range in your own eyes. Height 24156 ft. India's highest pick and world's third."
207,Majestic mountains,"This mountain is unique in the type of views it provides. Truly breathtaking. Standing up, as if floating in the sky, so majestic, one could just sit all day taking in the sight and still not have had enough of it. You just cant turn your back to it."
208,Exciting views on a nice clear day,"It is truly a wonder. Just stare at the mystical peaks, such a gigantic but beautiful nature's creation...the 3rd highest mountain peak of the world."
209,Good,Travelled the tough terrain to Sandhakpu by the British Era Range Rover and what a memorable ride it was. Saw the Kanchenjunga in all its glory at 530am in biting cold conditions.
210,Dissapointing,"The first trip with Bikash was in 2012: we went by car in North-Sikkim for 11 days nearly to the border of China and up to 4000 meters. Bikash was our guide and he was very friendly, helpfull and he organized the trip very best. The second one was two years later: we startet in Darjeeling did the Singalila Trip: a wonderful trekking tour up to 3300 meters. We saw the Mount Everest Range, the Kanchenjunga and so on. All was best organised, we liked to be with Bikash as our friend. In 2016 we went on the Goecha-la Trek from 1700 meters up to 4400 meters; wonderful weather, excellent sights to Pandim, Cabru, ... We couldn't reach Goecha-la because of heavy sowfall by night in Thangsing; therefore we went back to Kochurung. The next day was sunny like the days before. Bikash was very responsible, knew all about the region, it's weather and it's paths, was accompanied of a very friendly crew, our food was always fresh cooked and excellent and ... Therefore we want to come back to Sikkim to wage another trekking tour with our friend Bikash.We have to recommend Bikash to all people who are interested in such a wonderful region."
211,Sunrise is nice,"Missed sighting the Kanchenzonga during our 2 days  at Pelling due to the cloud covered skies, but we were fortunate to get a sight of the  Kanchenzonga from our hotel window at Summit Hermon in the evening when the skies cleared up after a downpour.We purchased a framed  photo of the Kanchenzonga from Das on Mall road as a momento of our Sikkim Darjeeling trip."
212,The Mighty King,Just hope for good weather. Although Darjeeling itself is still very nice in the mist. Take a trip to Tiger hill to see the mountain.
213,Extremely unpredictable,The magnificent and majestic Kanchen Dzonga will make you awestruck and you will definitely feel humbled.It's a pleasure to see the white mountain range raising well above the green hills.
214,Magical and Majestic,"Saw the sunrise from Tiger Hills and the reflection on the snowy peaks changing colour. Awesome. The peaks were also visible from the resort's dining hall and there was also a view=point from which we could observe them. Everywhere we went, it was as if the peaks were following us."
215,wait for the winters,Your Darjeeling or Gangtok visit is incomplete if you are unable to view the Sleeping Buddha. White mountain range backdrop of batasia loop or sunrise from Tiger Hill are unforgettable.
216,"Majestic Moutain , heart of Darjeeling","actually while i was in darjeeling, everyday heavy cloudy and shower. but the last day in the morning, it was sunny. i just through chowrasta square, got view point in 5min by walk.i could see Kanchenjunga! i got impressed!!! super beautiful!"
217,Kanchenjunga point,"When you say 'views' you must be meaning views of Kanchenjunga snow peaks, right? I can hear you saying 'Of Course'. Well if that's the case, then let's first start talking about the best time in the year to get such great views. Because the treasure peaks do not always show up and that too whenever you like them to."
218,Not the best view in summers,Saw it from my room in Lepchajagat. It's outright heavenly and out of this world. Please try and visit in seasons other than summer because the extreme heat in the plains causes the hills to be densely foggy which could obstruct your view of this peak for days.
219,superb!,"walk along the mall to shopping after viewing the mountain. level walk and easy to do. Excellent book store in mall, Oxford"
220,Wow what a range!!!,Can be seen throughout the journey if the weather is clear. The view is simply breath-taking. Major attraction for tourists traveling to Darjeeling/Gangtok
221,Most Magnificent ,See the incredible view  sunrise falling on snow mountains . Never imagine a morning with beautiful sunrise
222,Visible from most of Darjeeling ,Centrally located hotel . Everything within walking distance. Excellent service with ever smiling faces and very cute rooms made it very special. Cosy restaurant with a fireplace and small bar on the 4th floor . The breakfast and food were very good. Will definately repeat.
223,The Oeak,Third Highest Peak in the world and probably the most beautiful. Just saw a bit of the mountain during my visit but it was worth the peek.
224,Just Awesome,"We visited Darjeeling in the last week of March,17. For first 3 days it was all cloudy and rainy and we couldn't ever get a glimpse of Kanchenjunga. On the 4 day when the fog and cloud cleared and the mountain was visible, it was awesome. I just sat in hotel lobby and kept watching Kanchenjunga for hours. Very beatiful"
225,the name says it all,"On a sunny day, it presents an image like it is hanging fro the sky. And when the first ray of sun touches the mountain, you can not just move your eyes from the mountain. Kanchenjunga is best viewed from Tiger Hill, Darjeeling."
226,Beautiful ,good hill and awesome sunrise view at the time of sunrise the peak look like orange color and view was just nice
227,Awsum view from my hotel,"It's just amazing!! No words to describe the beauty of snow covered mountains. You simply cannot skip this, people visit Darjeeling to see this kind of stuff. if you are visiting Darjeeling and thinking of skipping this place, then you should skip your Darjeeling tour altogether."
228,REALLY AWESOME 😍👌,"clouds prevented us from having the view.Leave alone  the colossal peak, we could not even appreciate the mighty range..Booh! I believe October to Jan is the best period to witness clear sky, beautiful snow clad mountains and glistening sunrays reflecting from kanchenjunga."
229,Darjeeling musing,Feel like god is sleeping. Sleeping Buddha. Awesome sunrise and sunset view from different places. Specially at moonlit night. View from rin-chen-pong is superb. The peak is very closed to phalut and the view from sandakhphu and phalut is awesome.
230,Snow capped mountain,We were able to view it from our hotel room as we were unable to go to tiger hill due to small children ...it was very picteresque
231,Kanchenjunga ,Dawa from Blue Dragon Adventure and travel took us 12 to the Singalia ridge in early April. If you get up early you can watch the sun rise over the Kanchen... the view of a life time. Then the clouds cover the scenery! Wow the ridge is magnificent not to speek of the views of the Everest...
232,Mermerising View,Early morning wake up at 4.30am and reach tiger hill by 5 am and wait for the truly awesome sunrise and kanchejunga mountain when sun rays shows bright white mountain range.
233,non-view of kanchenjunga mountain in April because of cloudy whether ..,"Amazing views of the mountains from my hotel room, different shades of colours on the shining snow covered peaks."
234,Kanchanjunga can be viewed from the hotel,Nothing is as breathtaking as watching ng the sunrise turn the mountains pink then gold! Rising at 5.30 became a habit when we stayed in Darjeeling so we could catch the sunrise. Some days it will be misty but if you catch that magic moment it will live with you forever.
235,A dream come true,We started from our hotel at 4.15 in the early morning to witness the Mind blowing Golden Sky from a Place call Tiger Point. The Golden Border line start showing by 5.30 and it gradually get stronger stronger till 6.30am. The Disadvantage of this is the Freezing Cold (2 Degrees C) on the open sky and still the crowd was overwhelmed by the Scenic view.
236,Mighty Kanchenjunga,"Book into the Lunar Hotel and enjoy the awesome sight of the snow-covered Kanchen junga Mountain, the third highest mountain on earth! Climb Tiger Hill very early in the morning to take in the sunrise over the mountains and feel the vibes of the thousand or so fellow climbers who welcome the tip of the rising sun with a welcoming roar, and you can experience the same emotions of what the people living millennia ago felt what it was like to be alive in this astounding universe and to greet the sun without which we cannot live!"
237,Majestic Kanchanjanga,"Majestic, grand and awe inspiring. It was winter and the view was clear. I have been to Europe also and seen Mt Titlis and Jungfrau but I always find the Himalayas astounding. Kanchendzonga is the main attraction of Darjeeling. Hope the people of Darjeeling realize this and stop unauthorised construction of houses, shops, hotels, restaurants etc which are blocking the view from many places. At an approximate distance of 73 Kms from Darjeeling, its towering presence makes Darjeeling what it is. Don't miss the first rays of the Sun falling on the peak, a sight to behold."
238,Very Beautiful,"It was great to see the sunrise at Tiger Hill, but our guide was right, the mountains appearing before your eyes as the sun rises is breathtaking..."
239,Absolutely Stunning,Seeing the sunrise kissing the peak of the mountain is a must if you can bear the pain of getting up early at 4 AM to be able to reach the tiger point to catch a glimpse of the sunray bursting out over horizon setting the peak literally on fire with all visitors across furiously clicking to capture the savoury moment for posterity . It is one feeling that lingers on in some dingy corner of your brain and your mind will scream for more.
240,Magnificent Peak,Excellent view one can remember in their life time. Best time to visit is during winter and summer. One can spent an hour or more by sitting and viewing it.
241,Excellent view from Tiger Hiils,"Excellent view on a clear weather but one needs to be fortune with the climatic condition,  a walkable distance from the mall,  must must visit,  very cool and serene,  next to Nature"
242,Beautiful scenary,"If you are visiting in April and May, you need strong luck to see this mountain. I was lucky to see this majestic snow caped mountain second tallest range.  Good location apart from Tiger Hill is Darjeeling Railway Station. I was unlucky to see from Tiger Hill."
243,Absolutely beautiful!,See it and you will be astonished by it's beauty and might. The reflection of sunlight on the summit is a must see
244,Amazing view of Sunrise from Tiger Hill,"Blessed with fabulous weather - saw the sunrise EVERY morning over this mountain, both from my hotel room and during a trek along the Singalila Ridge"
245,Fascinating View,"The name Kanchenjunga is derived from four words of Tibetan origin, usually rendered Kang-chen-dzo-nga or Yang-chhen-dzö-nga and interpreted in Sikkim as the “Five Treasuries of the Great Snow.” The mountain holds an important place in the mythology and religious ritual of the local inhabitants, and its slopes were no doubt familiar to herdsmen and traders for centuries before a rough survey of it was made. he mountain and its glaciers receive heavy snow during the summer monsoon season and a lighter snowfall during the winter. The individual summits connect to neighbouring peaks by four main ridges,"
246,Can be seen from anywhere here.,This is only visible if you have a clear weather and fortunately we got to see this view from our room itself
247,majestic,Got to see the beautiful peaks covered with snow....I got a chance to get a few clicks is we were returning from Lachung to Gangtok
248,super beautiful!,The one less point is for its tendency to dissapoint/excite at will. the mountain chooses its own time to be visible.. But when visible presents a majestic view
249,Star Attraction of North Bengal & Sikkim,Couldnt see from the Tiger hill because of clouds and poor visibility.  The sunrise was not that good on that day.
250,beautiful mountain,"We have to get early in the morning at 3.00 AM and get ready to visit the place by taxi. It was told that on a clear day, the view will be great during sun rise. Unfortunately, we had visited in a cloudy day. It was a great disappointment for many."
251,NIce view of Kanchanjunga Peak,"“Location was great. The food was awesome. Promita Di and Raju make your stay really comfortable and we were able to get them to make us some ""pakode"" to go with our beer. Promita Di's Chicken Curry & separately, aloo-paratha was amazing!”"
252,Plain case of hype built fascination,Heavenly looks and peaceful environment. We dont need to go abroad to have such experience. Thanks the hospitality of Sikkim
253,Tallest of the land,I wish we had a clear view but the weather was not cooperative. The bottoms of the mountains peeked through but the full view was not showing up. The walk along the top is fun and full of action int the morning as all the locals exercise along the path near the Governor's house and the mall.
254,Very few things can match the view of Kanchenjunga,"Getting to see the almighty in most beautiful avtar on a clear  sky day in experience of life time.not to be missed, but need some luck with the weather"
255,Third highest mountain,Excellent.... In the  morning all the peaks are golden and as time passes it will be white. Changes of color can make you a feeling of Haven.
256,Stunning view of Kanchenjunga.,"Moutain was out of the clouds and could be viewed a short walking distance from the Mayfair Hotel. It was kind of hazy, but a beautiful range"
257,The most beautiful among Shivalik range,"Since I went in late Nov-early December, I was forewarned that there will be a lot cloudy days. This was certainly the case for me and often I felt disappointment as I could only see bits and pieces of Kanchenjunga peeking through the clouds from any view deck in Darjeeling.  On my very last day in Darjeeling while enroute to the airport in Bagdogra, the nature gods must be listening and opened this window where the skies fully cleared up briefly and I remember feeling so overwhelmed by the majestic beauty of Kanchenjunga even if I was admiring it from a moving vehicle - but it was alright as I felt honoured by just experiencing it, very humbling experience indeed."
258,"awesome, mesmerising",We waited & waited for three days for the clouds to clear and finally on 15th April we had the first glimpse of the majestic Kanchenjunga . The white towering beauty stood tall to showcase the magnanimity and we just kept looking for almost of half an hour with just click.. click.. click..
259,Awesome,It was cloudy throughout our visit. We saw the pictures but on the last day of our visit we could feel the cloud lifting little. It was amazing to see the mountains...Sad but we could not see the sunrise.
260,Inexpressible Beauty,"You must visit this place to get the unique experience. If you are lucky, you may see the golden reflection of rays on the mountain."
261,weather not great but beautiful view,"The name Kan- mean head, chen- mean belly and jungha- mean knee. So, if you can clearly view this three top at same time, you could see that Buddha is sleeping.That's why this hill is also known as sleeping Buddha."
262,Breathtaking!,Nice view clear sky. Nice to see from observatory hills. Sun rises around 5 AM. Nice to enjoy the sunrise
263,Beautiful ,we were unlucky first 2 days with foggy and cold weather but when it cleared and sun came out the view of this mountain was incredible.
264,excellent location,If u are having a sikkim or WB trip you won't miss it unless it remains cloudy...In my 12 days of trip  could barely see it for 3-4 times as it was raining many times or cloudy for rest of times ..early morning is the best time for great views..
265,View of Kanchenjunga Mountain from Khush Alaya Resort,We were lucky to see this mountain in all its glory.  It was the first time in two weeks since the fog had lifted. Blessed
266,Magnificent,"A must watch view.If you are lucky if clouds not there its a great view ,especially sunrise at that moment the nountain becomes glowing orange colour"
267,Incredible Mountain,To get the best view - it has to be your best day and you are wearing your most lucky cloths. The local weather is bit deceptive and the local pollution is also one of the key factor. the view you get is beautiful. worth watching.
268,Tracking,Had never known mountain ranges could be so breath takingly beautiful. Loved watching them and could have gone on watching them for ever. Can be seen from different points in mall road and also on way to Bagdogra.
269,Sun Rise,"Travellers,             One of the amazing place to visit at least once in a lifetime!!!!To see this spectacular sunrise , you need to go to Tiger hill top as early as around 3.30 am.The place starts to get crowded very soon. There are no such facilities to view from the top.It's a open plain ground. I'm not sure if some facility is available now .You can get hot coffee to sip in chilly windy morning , as there are many vendors who will be selling coffee.Locate yourself a comfortable place to view . You can see the miracle happen as your watch ticks near 6:00 am. You can see how beautifully the light starts to dissolve the darkness.As you keep viewing , an amazing thing awaits - The life giver of the Earth -The Sun slowly,gracefully emerges from a thick blanket of clouds like a bright orange ball.It is one of the most beautiful sight that I have seen. It looks like someone is popping a bright red ball from below the clouds.The sun starts appearing just as a tiny reddish orange ball and starts to engulf the entire place by its brightness.The sun's first ray falls om Mount Kanchenjunga , you can see how the entire snow capped mountain appears reddish when Sun light starts to fall on it.The saga of sun rise continues with the sun slowly emerging and rising above the horizon with changing colors finally leading to yellow. The snow capped Mountain Kanchenjunga now appears splendid. One of the engineering feats of nature !!!!Note: 1. Take a torch so that it will be helpful in the early morning to find the way. 2. Wear Sweater/Jackets,Gloves,Cap to keep yourself warm as it will be very cold .3. Make way early to the place and locate comfortable place to view the Sunrise4. There are no clean public toilets nearby.5. There is no entrance fee. 6. Proper signboards are missing in the place and hence need to be cautious.7. Avoid during cloudy and rainy season 8. Enjoy the Sunrise, Don't forget the camera :)"
270,Scenic !!!,"There was a Swiss couple standing next to me when the mist cleared and the mountain came into clear view.The Man said out loud "" Mon Dieu "".   I asked him ""any comparison to Jung Frau or Mont Blanc ?""   He just shook his head in awe."
271,Breath-taking experience,"just one that u need to wake up early in the morning the golden reflection on the white mountain gives awesome pleasure, Sikkim's peaks must visit."
272,Magnificent Kanchenjunga,hearing and reading and seeing with awe is all different and unique in its own way. Describing is difficult the emotion involved is much more than few words can express. i was only able to get a fractional glimpse of it and is was more than words itself that can be used to express the same.
273,Like a dream.,"Location is at descent place, you have to wake up around 4am. But if you have a luck then sure you will see the sunrise and also Kanchenjunga."
274,the queen of himalaya,"It was the early days of April/May, and I was on a hunt for some beautiful treks of West Bengal, Sikkim, and Nepal border. I heard as it’s the flowering season of the region, I could spot a much different variety of flora and fauna. Close to 50 varieties of Rhododendron Flower bloom in this season. Thanks to the Expert’s advice from travel magazines, I found it’s the best time to spot red pandas and red pigeons. It was damn cold outside, probably in minus, but this is the time my hard work pays off. I tied my shoes, picked up my camera, rolled up my water bottle back into the sleeping bag and head to find a perfect viewpoint for my captures. The next 40 mins of my life were so beautiful that I don’t find enough words to describe it. The first ray on Mt Everest was shining like a diamond, Mt Makalu, and Mt Lhotse, guarding the previous mountain in the middle, tilt your head to the right direction, and you see the range of Mt Kanchenjunga sleeping like meditating Buddha waking up to twitting birds and rising sun and in minutes becomes a Golden Key."
275,Get a clear view for its enormity,Don't feel you have to wake up at 4am and join a procession of jeeps to Tiger Hill to view this mountain range. You don't! It can be viewed from most parts of Darjeeling and given the fact that cloud can come in at short notice it is best to see it when you can. We had a great view from the Tibetan refugee centre just north of the zoo.
276,Majestic!,"It has its uniqueness, its cruelty, its fierceness,  everything is beautiful... and satiate your mind and your wish. Its enormity would definitely make you wonder about all those mountaineers who have conquered The Kanchenjunga. Only The Everest matches its class... but then again you have to visit Nepal."
277,Just awesome view,"Everytime I see it the feelings is the same of the first visual, have seen it from different place and different angles but the view from the View point of mall road is probably the best. In the month of March it's very rare to see the entire range but on 12th and 13th this year in early morning the entire range was visible. Definitely every single person will like the view."
278,life is beautiful here,if you are lucky enough then you will be able to see this view. Excellent and no word to express.. we have enjoy enough the view .. the hotel ( sinclairs ) where we have stayed ...
279,Fantastic natural beauty,"We did start at 4 am to get the view at the tiger hills, but luck did not favour us, on a monday morning at 4 am the route to Tiger hill was burdened with heavy traffic and we ended up 2 kms before the view point. Managed to walk all the way which was infact refreshing, cool walk into the bustling crowd all the way to top. The view was excellent at the point and the effort was worth the walking. I would suggest to start early around 3 AM if you need you are hesitant to walk."
280,Wonderful view from Batsil,"It was an experience that cant be expressed in words. It does something to you. Looks beautiful from tashi view point, gangtok but the view from tiger hills, Darjeeling is breathtaking."
281,Highest point of India,"Sorry, No view in 3 days that I stayed this time. Last year, around the same time, I managed to see once from the view point in front of Dolphin Hotel. Not this time. Bad Luck!"
282,Great views,"As others have said, you don't need to go to Tiger Hill at dawn - why not go a few hours later, avoid the crowds who may spoil the experience, and still see the mountains in all their glory.  One of the experiences of our lives, we gasped at the view as we nearer the summit of the hill.  It's also true that you can get an excellent view from Darjeeling itself, just round the corner from the Governor's mansion - but that view from Tiger Hill is worth the extra journey if you really want to see Kanchenjunga in its true glory.."
283,View,I was told by hotel to wake up early in the morning at about 3 AM. I was ready and we reached at the view point at about 4:30 AM. When the first light of the sun fell to the peak it was just a golden mountain.
284,Place of lord buddha and shiva,"Initially I was disappointed as it was misty, however the mountains did appear intermittently and you have to be fast to get a photo. worth getting up early to view."
285,just Beautiful,"We visited the place with an inquisitive 9 year old and honestly, we were floored by the diverse things this place had to show us - from depicting the tough life through life size figures to the famous mountain myths, this place has it all. Truly a unique and unmissable experience!"
286,Very tall,"best place.....cant express the feeling .nice place for honeymoon couple as nothing much to do ,you just have to chose best hotel so that you can enjoy the view and scenic beauty...."
287,Breathtaking!!,"Absolutely stunning sun rise, Very large crowd of people. Need warm clothes as very cold. Sun shining of snow on mountains great."
288,Majestic!,"Must visit place. Have to be so early. Book cab a day before, driver will pick you up from hotel. Leave you hotel by 4am anyhow. Reach Tiger hill by 5 for amazing Sunrise."
289,Queen of Hills,"Beauty you can only experience, can't really imagine reading reviews or even watching photographs. Covered and hidden behind mist for most days, have to be lucky to see it from Darjeeling."
290,An amazing symmetrical mountain,One of the best view ... Far from annoying sounds /polution eaternal peace fresh breath... Walk with clouds
291,"Beauty you can experience, can't imagine",one of the most beautiful moment in my lifei wake up early in the morning and go to siteoh what a viewthe sun is rising and the other side the Kanchenjunga mountain going visible and redi can not explain!!!!!
292,Kanchenjunga review,We were sceptical of visiting as not always the sun rises . But somehow we convinced ourselves of taking the risk.. Reached by 04.45 AM.. Sun rose at sharp 05.03AM.. The view was breathtaking and phenomenal... Sun rays were falling on the Kanchenzunga peak and was glistening golden.. Absolutely stunning.. A Must Visit..
293,Good view,"really yr,agar isko jb maine dekha tha to mujhe belive he nhe ho rha tha ke maine isko dekha or its a natural best part of my life to view a mountain...."
294,Kanchanjangha,I dont know why people waste time and wake up early and go to tiger hill.  Just go by 6 am near the governors bungalow
295,Kanchenjunga Range,Never had enough of her. She changes color and facet from time to time. Simply breath taking. Summit Grace hotel has a pretty good view of Kanchenjunga. Another good spot is Tiger Hill.
296,Unbelievable and amazing view,Went on a trek with Adventures Unlimited and it was great. Really looked after me. Seek them out. Catherine will look after you prior and after the the trek and ask for Ajay the guide if you can. Trekking par excellence
297,10 minute window.,"What can I say about this fantastic place? Only thing is the weather, which may ruin your adventures."
298,Amazing View,"It took a few days for the clouds to clear so that we could see the mountain, but when we did it was absolutely stunning. A must-see!"
299,Unbelievable,"It hits you like a thunderbolt. You have to see it to believe it, no words can do justice to the early morning view of the might snowcapped mountain shining bright in the sunlight. We were lucky to have this view from our resort room and the weather was on our side. I have heard about people unable to catch a glimpse of the peak even after spending weeks due to bad weather. We went to Tiger Hills at 5 am hoping to catch both Kanchenjunga and Everest, but luck was not on our side and the view was completely hidden due to the weather situation. We could understand that mountaineering expeditions are not permitted on Kanchenjunga since it is treated as secret by the people in the hills."
