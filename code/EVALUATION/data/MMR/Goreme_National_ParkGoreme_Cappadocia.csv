0,Must Visit,You are not considered visiting Cappadocia if you are not visiting this generally rich-legacy UNESCO site.
1,Open-air museum,You are not counted as visiting Cappadocia if you are not visiting this historically rich-heritage UNESCO site.
2,Amazing,"If you’re going alone and not as part of a guided tour, do invest 15TL on the audio guide. This one is really good and worth the money adding lot of perspective to the architecture you see.An important thing to note is that the entrance fee is cash only. We were lucky that we had some cash to cover for it since we always prefer to pay by card at such places!"
3,Amazing ,"If you visit Cappadocia, you must see Goreme Open Museum. It is the most comprehensive site. But crowded with tourists."
4,Interesting place with full of history,"Do explore the moon-like landscape of this unique and ancient area when you are in the region of Cappadocia, Turkey. There are hundreads of chapels carved into the hillside and the first religious colonies found here dated back to 373AD, is truly an unforgettable and memorable experience."
5,Experiencing Winter during Spring at Cappadocia,"When you visit Turkey, Cappadocia is an absolute must. At first site you will think you are on another planet. Though the region has developed a lot over the past 10 years in regard to hotels, restaurants, you are in a World Unesco Heritage Site and National Park which is highly protected. The village of Goreme itself is, in my opinion,.the most charming of the five villages in the province though you cannot really count Nevsehir as it is actually the capital city of the province and not village like at all. Goreme has the highest number of Fairy Chimneys  and churches in the region so I highly recommend that you make your Cappadocia base in Goreme. There are numerous restaurants where you can feast upon absolutely yummy traditional Turkish food, but I would wander up into the old side of the village and simply ask where yo ucan find the restaurant where 'Top Deck' is the chef. He and his wife create excellent dishes you will never forget! Your days can be filed with hot air ballooning (very worthwhile - recommend Cappadokya Balloons), go horseback riding, take a 4 wheeler, absolutely visit the underground cities (at least one of them), the hot springs or just enjoy walking through the valleys. This is a photographers paradise with sunsets and sunrises not to be matched. Though many of the farmers have moved away they are still to be found just outside the village and have many a story to be told. You can always travel to the easide but do not miss Goreme, National Park!"
6,Amazing,"In the event that you are in the Cappadocia Region, The National Park/Open Air Museum is one of the spots you should see. While you can appreciate the first types of mountain and fairy smokestacks, you can study the early time of Christianity. Particularly beginning from the second century AD, some Christian priests pulled in the consideration of adherents. Subsequently, you can see a few houses of worship created in caverns. A few caverns are under rebuilding and some of them like ""Karanlık Kilise/Dark Church"" requires additional section charge. At the door of the open air museum, you can visit to the trinket shop, bistro, and rest rooms. I for one like the bona fide bistro in one of the caverns."
7,Fascinating,"When you visit the Gerome open air museum you will be moved by the faith of these early Christians. With more than a dozen chapels carved into the rock formations and rich (but now defaced) paintings it is easy to imagine the faithful flocking to this place for pilgrimage. The rock formations are fascinating. It is little difficult to see all the chapels but if you can manage the steep climbs , it is worth it. The place is well maintained with good signage"
8,Must go!,"If you are in the Cappadocia Region, The National Park/Open Air Museum is one of the places you must see. While you can enjoy the original forms of mountain and fairy chimneys, you can learn more about the early period of Christianity. Especially starting from the 2nd century AD, some Christian monks attracted the attention of believers. Thus, you can see several churches developed in caves. Some caves are under restoration and some of them like ""Karanlık Kilise/Dark Church"" requires extra entry fee. At the gate of the open air museum, you can visit to the souvenir shop, cafe, and rest rooms. I personally like the authentic cafe in one of the caves."
9,Amazing scenery and history ,Surely a must visit if in the Goreme area.Many examples of early Christian art together with cave dwellings.Please note that there is a very interesting church just outside the main complex which is probably the most interesting? Visiting this church is part of the Museum ticket
10,Love,A must see in Goreme. The park is well preserved and well maintained. I am sure you will click some amazing photos there.
11,A must-visit place in Cappadocia,It is a must experience to understand Cappadocia’s history.I always visit this park with my guest. There are severely churches and to walk around to feel the valley is always make me feel good.
12,This is what people come to Turkey for!!,"If you manage to get to this part of the world goreme open air museum is something that should not be missed the 45lirs entrance fee is great value, also one in you should pay the extra 15lira entrance fee into the dark church, the 12 century frescos are amazing and look as if they were painted yesterday"
13,Informative and rich in history,Interesting and informative place understand the development of Cappadocia.  Do not miss the different churches dug into the caves that were later decorated with Byzantine paintings.  It was interesting to see how the cave diggers mimicked the decorative patterns and architectural features of the Byzantine Churches.
14,Astounding,"İf you are interesting with lanscapes,caves,churches And nature this is best museum in cappadocia...."
15,Marvelous,"If you’re in Göreme and surrounds, the open air museum is a must see to get a real feel of the surroundings.Easily accessible, very exposed and hot, so plan accordingly!"
16,interesting,A place full of history and christianity. You can go there by yourself or you cand take a private tour.
17,Magical land,A must visit in cappadocia. You get to see all the old churches in their fairytaleLandscape . It does get hot so remember to carry sunscreen and a hat! And goodWalking shoes :)
18,Interesting,"Another must see. Nice to see the church caves with drawings of the saints still preserved. Again be sure to bring umbrella, sunblock and water."
19,Interesting,"Really amazing! We appreciated our tour guide, who really knew the park. A must do if you are in Goreme!"
20,Very Nice!,"If you only go to one place in Cappadocia then this would be the place to go.A wonderful and interesting place easy to walk around, though with little shade if you were visiting in the middle of summer.A lot to see in a small area."
21,"The Best Combination of Geomorphology, History, and Anthropology","A great walk around gives you an incredible perspective of this UNESCO site. A pity that this touristy spot has a few restaurants which are super expensive but if you wander around, you will find a number of great gems, including the Organic Cave Kitchen"
22,Something interesting around every corner,I would advise people not to take a full-day tour of goreme national park it's better to take a panoramic sightseeing overview so that you can cover it as much as well as you will cover much of it through your hot air balloon ride so no need to spend 3 or 4 hours.
23,Spectacular eroded landscape with ancient ruins,This is large open air experience where you walk through an ancient valley of cave dwellings and churches. Guides are available but the site is well signposted. There are several small eateries offering a range of local food. Excellent for a half day tour.
24,Christian history,"if you were to choose amongst places to explore this is one park that you should not miss.  It provides an open area museum of Byzantine churches, monastery and plenty of fairy chimneys to choose from."
25,Deserve,"An impressive site not to be missed whilst in the Cappadocia region. The 4000 year old history here is simply incredible. The paintings in the churches are unbelievable to see. Our family thoroughly enjoyed our time here, and it was made all the richer by having our fabulous guide Eda with us for the day sharing all her knowledge. Highly recommend visiting, and if you can your experience will be that much better with a guide (you can find Eda on the Tours By Locals website - the best guide in Turkey!)."
26,Wouldn't bother,"Gerome in itself is an open air museum , you need not to pay for it ...go anywhere in gerome and you will enjoy ... go nearby places for sunrise or sunset"
27,Stunning,Pros:• spectacular scenery; you’ll want to take hundreds of photos• fascinating history. Cons:• it helps to have a guide to make the most of your visit• make sure you are prepared for the heat.
28,Amazing work of nature ,This is a very historic landscape.  So many things to see and do.  Get out and explore.  The old cave dwellings in the park have some ancient fresco style paintings on the walls that are many centuries old.  You must plan a hot air balloon ride also!  It’s magical!
29,Good way to spend a few hours and get close to the formations,We walked to the open air museum and bought the audio guide rather than going as a tour. There is not a lot of signage around telling you what you're seeing inside the caves. The audio tour was cheap but not worth it. It was worth the trip to see but looking into a tour might be worthwhile as you're likely to get more information that would make the experience better
30,Beautiful place,"Discovering Goreme National Park was amazing. Various tours take in some of the main sites and viewpoints. However if you like hiking and clambering over landscapes this is an absolute must. There are numerous valleys to explore. Lots of great threads and information on here which we used on a daily basis. Views are breathtaking and I lost count how many times we  simultaneously said ""Wow!"". The popular tours and the valley walks are fairly easy going and trainers are sufficient but if you fancy going a little 'off piste"" it can be hard work especially considering the heat. For this I would recommend hiking shoes/boots or trainers with very good soles as you need traction on some steep declines."
31,Mesmerizing history of man,"The whole of cappadocia has such stunning natural beauty that one has to visit to feel and explore its beauty...There are beautiful rock formations. The fairy chimneys also add to the beauty if the landscape. The goreme church is beautifulWe took a hotair baloon over cappadocia which was the highlight of the trip.. The sunrise over cappadocia was stunning with coloured hotair balloons lighting up all around. We flew over pigeon valley, fairy chimneys upto Urgrup castle. Finally champagne on landing... U can also take the Red or Green tour which shows the Underground cities and how the people lived so many hundred years ago.. The whole town with burial areas were underground.. Amazing network of tunnels and stairs that u dont realize that Derinkuyu goes down to 60metres below ground !!Cappadocia is A Must Visit and the balloon ride is once in a life experienceFor the balloon we took Sky Balloons and a 16-18 people balloon as prices vary according to number of ppl in a balloon. Average 180-200 euros pp. U can negotiate. Tip: Get in the Balloon the last as u will then have the corner !!"
32,Arid Moon Like Landscape !,"Don't miss, if you are in Goreme area, do not miss it! Pictures give a small idea of the real thing, live experience is a must do!"
33,Goreme National Park.,"A must see place when in kappadocya.The views there and experience are breath taking, you will see history dating thousands of years.Bring a good camera, you will be using it a lot."
34,Church among mosques,"A great place to visit if you're interested in historical information, geology, and archaeology.It features a rocky, water- and wind-eroded landscape with a network of ancient, interconnecting underground settlements."
35,totally stunning!,This amazing aprk has plenty of things to do. A must see if you're going to Cappadoccia. Beautiful rock formations
36,First trip,This is among the place u should visit in CappadociaNice place and nice cave ChurchIf u know background of Christianity u can understand difference in churches.. otherwise all cave seems same.. however awesome environment n beautiful landscapingTry to visit in evening for good view of nature
37,Beautiful place to visit,"Open-air museum, our guide said, and it really is. The important amount is sites of interest. Wear comfortable shoes and sun protection."
38,interesting,We were recommended to visit this area of Cappadocia as seeing was believing. The recommendation was spot on. You need to be here to appreciate the landscape in front of your eyes not just through pictures
39,Cappadocia,"Step into history as you explore the cave dwellings and natural wonders in the rose, love and pigeon valleys."
40,Great area with some really nice hikes,"Great experience. Nice photo places if you climb the hill. You have an area for food, drinking, and good restroom. Wheelchair accessible area. Kids will like the camel ride."
41,Amazing place,"This is an exceptional site on most world travelers’ bucket lists. The mural paintings in the churches are some of the best to see in Turkey. It is worth paying the extra fee to enter the cave churches. The cave dwellings are fairly well preserved but some subsidence and reconstruction work is done after heavy rains. One can see the stone tables, benches and cooking areas. Great to hike around and between the natural stone marvels."
42,Interesting place that can get very crowded ,Had a great time viewing the churches in the Goreme national park. All are interesting.  some are well preserved and others have been renovated.  Worth paying the extra to see the dark church which has some of the best paintings. The caves with tables and cooking pits are also interesting.
43,Another Ancient Wonder!,"Cappadocia is an amazing place to visit. The landscape formations,underground homes, churches ,are all mind blowing.Great walks available through the valleys."
44,Unique Outdoor Museum,THis place is just fantastic. Love the tuffas and the amazing stories of past communities. If you love story go there...spend time in silence inside those caves and it is almost like you can see it....
45,worth visiting!,"Something new around every corner. You are going to love Turkey! The Goreme National Park was delightful. It was so fun to wander around the go in and out of this little piece of history. Amazingly well preserved and fun to imagine what life might have been like living there. We all loved the experience here. We came with an escorted tour group, but I'm so glad they chose this stop. After talking to others, we wish we had paid extra to see the church."
46,Beautiful view,"It’s a very nice place, a must go when visiting Capadoccia. You walk though what was a Village located around a valley, with many carved houses with its different rooms (stable, kithchen, bedroom...). You can also get inside an ancient church that still has a few signs of paintings on the walls and also a small mosk. I recommend to spend at least 30-40 min to do the full walk around The Valley."
47,Amazing view Recommend with kids,"I recommend the Goreme National Park as a whole but because it includes alot of separate attractions, Fairy Chimneys, etc. and the confusion with the Outdoor Museum I think the TA editors need to look at this."
48,Not to be missed,Amazing place takes u back to way beyond imagination history.Facinating place to visit. Worth going when in Cappadocia.
49,Amazing Goreme and an out of this world setting,All Cappadocia is lovely. Deserve to go everywhere. Sometimes a little bit boring because everywhere are tourists and everybody stops the car near the rocks and you cant took good pictures for memory.
50,beautiful,"This is a not to miss when in Goreme. The cave churches and frescoes were amazing. Built into the landscape of the area, the UNESCO World Heritage site is a gem. Be prepared to walk uphill and have a hat and water."
51,Amazing rock formations ,This is a must see in Cappadocia. We were on a tour and we knew nothing before we got here . We are happy we saw this
52,Astonishing,Must visit! Stunning vistas with interesting rock formations. Lots of history and culture. Enjoyed the frescoes.
53,Not like any other,"Cappadocia Turkey is an amazing valley of fairy chimneys and homes and churches carved into the rock.  Goreme has amazing churches on various levels of the rock, many with lovely murals and paintings.  Be sure to allow time to visit as you do need to climb up and down to see everything, but it is so worthwhile to do so."
54,Unbelievable landscape,"This open air museum is worth a visit to experience the authentic cave structures of the area. It is dedicated to a Christian settlement of monks, priests and nuns who lived there around the 3rd century. There are about a dozen small churches and cave rooms, some with their original paintings which are now quite faded and in need of restoration. But restoration has begun and it will be more interesting in years to come. It cost 45 lire ( about £6 ) at the time of our visit . There is also an additional 15 lire to visit the dark church where the paintings are naturally brighter but we didn't opt for this. Or you can hire a headset for information at an extra 15 lire, but there are written explanations outside of every structure which we found sufficient. The site itself is very steep with slopes and steps so may not be suitable for those with mobility issues.There is a small coffee shop at the top of the site which is a very traditional Turkish style- not much seating if more than about half a dozen people are there.. Drinks here are expensive compared to outside the site and further down the road- 10 compared to 3 for the same drink! But you pay for the ambience ! Overall it's a very interesting place with several unique photo opportunities"
55,Göreme National Park,This is a great place to see the fairy chimneys up close and the beautiful mosaics in the cave churches. Plan to spend some time here to explore and learn about the unique landscape of Cappadocia.
56,Amazing Rock formations,Goreme is a must do place to visit. The landscape is incredible and if you can organise a hot air balloon trip do!
57,Rocky scenery _1st place we visit in the area,"we visited this site on a day tour. it's truly amazing and exquisite. a real travel back in time, a fantastic experience."
58,Goreme,Visited the Göreme National Park on FourTrack; it was a great tour and scenery was beautiful. I highly recommend it.
59,An area worth visiting ,Goreme National Park is a must see for those traveling to this area.  My 10-year old son and I took a “Green Route” tour through some of the areas of the park which included a short 5k hike down the river valley.  It was autumn and the leaves were green and gold which made for great views in the river valley and a relaxing walk along the trail.  In the areas of the park which are away from the river you’ll find great phot opportunities as the sun illuminates the rock formations and the desert landscape.
60,Very Impressive,"Open air museum is an interesting title to draw you in. Shows a lot of the history of the area and how much of their life was based around religion (Christian, banned at the time) and the lengths they would go to, to hide it. I haven’t given it 5 stars as I just feel there is more that can be done to enhance the visitor’s experience. Felt a bit restricted in options."
61,Mind blowing ,"Great place for pictures and also to learn about history. Best to go with a tour guide who can explain the various stops and the history behind them. Panaromic views are a joy to look at. Remember to wear a good pair of shoes as place has rock surfaces and some slopes, but very walkable."
62,Global wonder ,"Unique Fairy chimneys will lead you to feel the Fairy tales lives. Hot air balloon tour goes over there, don’t miss the chance to be there"
63,Breathe taking,It was a great tour i really enjoyed that place. Our tour guide was veri informative and. My child was very happy there
64,Nice Park,"You came here to see a place like no other , interesting , unique , intriguing , one that will remain in your memory for sure as it is all that and more . Enjoyed every minute of it and surely you will too ."
65,Amazing,"This is also one of the must-see in Turkey. Our guide from TSC travel did a great job in giving historic information every step of the way. There's a lot of amazing land formation, the pavements, remaining pillars of the ones famous place, cave like buildings that has drawings and paintings from the ancient times. The theater ruin is another spectacle of this place.The beauty of the scenery is just so wonderful to see. I can really feel and smell how old this place is and the story that comes with it. I can go on and on...but my words can't really describe the ancient wonder of this place.You must wear comfortable shoes though."
66,Red Tour Stop,"During a three day walking tour bthrough different parts of the Goreme Hills and park area, it gives avery good impression of the natural beauty of the area. The sizes of the geological formations are best appreciated from below."
67,Goreme National Park,"Everything in Cappadoccia is surreal and memorable, but Goreme is really the best place to stay and the National Park is absolutely breathtaking. Can’t wait to go back"
68,WONDERFULL,"This is a unique open air museum that will take you on a magical trip  with fairy chimneys, ancient caves,  pigeon houses and natural volcanic rock formations.Walking down steps that offer close views of the vivid shapes of rocks that have been formed over centuries will soothe your eyes."
69,A Spiritual Experience ,Beautiful park where you can have a good idea about how this place was few years ago. Don’t waste the opportunity.
70,A throwback to medieval times,Goreme national part was an amazing place to visit and is a must see for anyone that enjoys the natural world. The only other place that I have visited where I felt I was on another planet was Bryce Canyon I rented a car and drove around capaddocia and I would definitely recommend.
71,Amazing ancient Byzantine cave dwellings.,"A must see for all travellers.. Jaw dropping landscapes and amazing scenery.. Hike around the valleys, e.g. Pigeon Valley and enjoy Turkish tea amidst the red terrain..Just do it.."
72,Amazing,"this place is definitely worth visiting, especially with a good guide! you will need comfy shoes/trainers, sunglasses and a hat, too, b/c it's really hot and sunny in autumn!"
73,A different experience,"I've done the Open Air Museum twice....once with a guide and once with the audio.  Both were very interesting and have their advantages. The guide can be a good storyteller and give 'extra' information, while the audio is very factual.  It's almost worth doing both together!  Definitely pay the extra 10 lira to see the Dark Church.  The paintings in there are the best ones at the Museum."
74,Cutouts on Rocky Mountains,"There are several cave churches to visit in this open air museum complex, one or two of which are simply stunning.However, the museum is incredibly busy with masses of school and tourist groups meaning you have to queue for every church - and some have an attendant inside barking at you to keep shuffling along meaning you can’t really stop and look at anything properly.I guess if you get there when the doors open it might be a better experience, but if you’re on an organised tour, this won’t happen. All photography is prohibited in the caves, meaning you can’t even take home your memories of those beautiful frescos. This seems excessive as stopping flash photography only should be sufficient."
75,Out of the world experience,"Everything in Göreme is beautiful!! I really enjoyed every landscape!I believe people must be more careful with trash in a place like that, because I saw several plastics, paper thrown away in the ground!"
76,Very distinct national park,The park is definitely beautiful but there are other equally beautiful places in Göreme. Check it out if you have time - we did it as part of the red tour package.Try and avoid tour bus crowds by going early am. Better photo opportunities elsewhere
77,Very interesting,"Incredible place for hiking and sightseeing. Best if combined with the underground city in Kaymakli and Dervish ceremony. We hired a local, certified guide Zafer Hoca. He is retired English teacher, very knowlageble and nice.His number is 05367260968. He directed us to the Dervis Evi, a small place of worship Southeast exit from Goreme for the authentic performance (not a restaurant). Euro 10 pp. Starts at 6 pm, after the ceremony they dance for a while and let you take pictures. Tel. 90 384 343 20 80, 90 532 486 32 54."
78,First introduction to Cappadocia region,"Part of Red  tour. It's amazing place to learn history. Fascinating place to visit. Very photogenic. Apple Church was culmination for me as frescos were just stunning . Can't take pictures inside Chapels and Churches ... but surroundings are just amazing . Wear comfortable shoes, lots climbing , high steps, bit tight on the staircases - but it's stunning ."
79,"Rock, Sand and Caves",Self guided tour of cave dwelling like churches and homes.  Plan on about two hours to see everything.  Go counterclockwise once you enter the grounds.  Signs outside caves give brief narrative of what you will see in most places.
80,Fascinating history ,"A wonderfully exciting customised tour with StreamCo Tours again. We have travelled much of Turkey now but Fatih always finds somewhere interesting and different for us to experience. Lovely Boutique Hotels, excellent food and comfortable travel...what more could you ask for. Without question we will return to experience the wonders of this incredible country. Thankyou Fatih, you are an excellent guide and now yours and our friendship has been extended to our son Graham who so enjoyed everything. Until next time......"
81,Worth a visit,Went to the Outdoor Museum with a private guide and so worth while. Incredible to think that an ancient population lived in these caves. Definitely worth a visit
82,Must See,"See how people lived a thousand years in these churches/monasteries. A place like no other so definitely worth a visit for the uniqueness and stunning views. Try the Turkish coffee in the little cafe, they make it on sand - it's really good and I don't even like coffee!"
83,Good for those who are interested in History,"Wonderful place to visit. Takes you back 2000 years. Interesting to see how early Christians stayed and spread their religion. Excellent frescos. If you are in Goreme., this is a must visit place"
84,"Cappadocia is not a place to rush through, its worth to take your time.","I cannot compare Cappadocia with anywhere in the world. It is really out of this world. I took 3 days trek to the valley which brought me the best experience about the beauty of the nature. The trek is not too tough for everyone, it is just a walk around. We were surrounded by the roses smell and the birds singing.Everyone should at least discover Cappadocia once in lifetime."
85,Historical,"A facinating must visit Byzantine cave dwelling complex with catacombs, skeletons, ancient paintings, scenes of religious persecution - an ode to human endurance and spirit"
86,So interesting and a very worthwhile trip,There´s a reason this site is a UNESCO heritage site. Unbelievable landscape and manmade habitats inside the cliffs.
87,Wonderful Experience ,"It is a very special and beautiful place, a place where history is experienced .. where it is processed to the finest detail. Roasted coffee and wines are more beautiful than each other. The historical structure in the hotels is another, meaningful with every structure .."
88,Great view and experience,"Perfect place for hiking. Beautiful view. Very interesting land formation. Make sure you have hiking shoes, no flip flops or high heels."
89,Fascinating,"Im talking only about museum part closed with the fence. This place is overrated, stones, tiny caves and hot sun! That is all what youll get there. The entrance fee is ridiculously high for such a boring place! (45 lira). Funny thing -that the same stones and caves you may see for free around this “museum territory”"
90,Arriving early won’t save you...just be patient.,"Goreme National Park is full of early christian history. The place is always crowded. There are toilets at the entrance. Use it before going inside. There is a museum shop also. Take atleast a water bottle with you. There is lot of walking around inside and a little bit of uphill walk also. Lots of old churches with fresco art. The churches were carved out of the rocks. Good place for photography. I was surprised that so many people were smoking inside. It should not be allowed. Yes it is not a closed space but still its a heritage site and smoking should not be allowed. Going early morning makes no difference, the place is always crowded. Take a camera along and enjoy."
91,Incredible place,An amazing place not like anywhere else I have seen. Loads to see and do (and eat!) from ballooning to organised tours and horse riding. But just the hiking alone is spectacular enough.
92,Waste of money,The landscape is amazing. Absolute nice to make a small walk. Good for photografing. one of the most beautiful areas on earth.
93,Beautiful ,"So many hikes easy to do by yourself, incredible landscapes.. Lot of activities available. Amazing, I will go back for sure"
94,Must visit in Goreme,Seeing is believing it was absolutely fantastic and well worth the long journey to get there. If you are within 6 hours by road it really is something else. You should book a hotel for 1-3 nights to make the most of your time there.
95,Fascinating! Don’t miss this one!,you will be amazed if you see the unique churches and frescos that they are there. Its a unique park full of Christian history. Its a must while you are visiting Cappadocia
96,Amazing UNESCO site,"As we visited Turkey on a tight schedule, we had planned the trip and booked our hotels, so it is ashamed that we did not get to spent more time in Cappadocia. It is an extraordinary place with so many history and beauty. We visited Goreme on a rainy day, so our photos end up looking gloomy. But it was still special to get to see all the fairy chimneys up close, we never would though we will get to be there in person after seeing the place only though photos. It was magical, and we had the honour to visit one of the chimney house, to have tea and talk to the house owners. It was a wonderful experience."
97,Incredible sites,This is a delightful spot to visit with mind boggling rock developments. You will see delightful landscape like no other. Just astonishing.
98,Amazing geological formations ,"Gerome National Park is a must for all when visiting this area. Scenery is awesome and theres so much too see.   The paths are well laid out, needless to say to be a bit careful. Amazing place."
99,Mr myers,Forgiveness of nature to the industrious people who appreciate it. Pass Natural history course so much funney.
100,Half of the reviews here are for the Goreme Outdoor Museum!,There are so many atttactions in capaddocia region and i can easily put this place in my top 3. Definetly visit if you are in the area.
101,A complex of churches and dormitories that housed over 2000 people!!,"Stretching a vast area with hills and mountains, Goreme National Park remains so close to our hearts. Our guide was always helpful that he explained about the rock formations  and nature made art work on such mountains."
102,so much history.. a lovely place,"the open air museum has a very chap entrance fee and it is totally worth it. the landscape is amazing and the views too. in the rocks, there are houses, churches and rooms that it is amazing how people made them! go early, avoid the crowds!"
103,Fairy chimneys up close!,"Location is nice to visit, you will see a lot of variations in small area!! Nice experience.I will advise to read about this area and how it was established long time ago, this will help you in understanding why homes, churches, rooms were built in that way, and why too close to each other."
104,Real nature ,"Words cannot describe my experience and you have to be there to believe it see it and experience it. From caves to mountains, oceans, volcanoes, Roman empire, Christianity, pottery, food, and so much more.."
105,Beautiful place,"Goreme National Park is the star attraction of Cappadocia.  The various frescos inside the churches, combined with the breathtaking landscapes, are amazing.  Allow at least 1.5 hours due to lines that must be endured to enter the chapels.  Enjoy!"
106,Fairy Chimneys Fairy Tales,Great park. Super fun to visit. Nice hiking trails with many unique formations. Like another planet. Truly worth a visit.
107,Interesting! ,"Rock formations in the area, I think it is worthy the ride.One of many touristics spots  in Cappadocia."
108,A must visit - beautiful views and stunning history,Cinfirmation that there were Christians in the area.Are. Identical to the Orthodox Churches as interior arhitecture and biblical scenes painted on the walls.
109,Impressive Historical Site,Such unique and wonderful national park to visit. Had to see it at least once in your life time. You can rent a car or joint a tour group. Nice local people as well.
110,Amazing place a must,"We visited this places back in August, the weather was not too hot as we were expecting in Cappadocia, so it was very comfortable visiting all these open places.If you have the chance visit the place early morning as soon as it opens because then is extremely way too crowded and is difficult to enter to the churches inside the caves, or there is a line to enter die to the huuuuge groups they arrive around 12:00 pm.The place is amazing but if you dont like crowded places just come very early in the morning to avoid all the mass of tourists."
111,breathtaking views,The chapels in the fairy chimneys features incredible frescoes so worth seeing.  It was crowded with tourists and the steps up to some places a bit squashed.  I would definitely recommend going early or planning a trip there out of the peak tourist season.
112,A bucket list visit ,Goreme National Park is fantastic !.The Landscape changes constantly as it is volcanic and it can only be described as looking like the surface of the moon.The Fairy Chimneys are special and you will get great photos without people around you.I would recommend getting a guide by the name of Busra from Pulsar Turizm..she was fantastic and very knowledgeable.Most sites have souvenir sellers and places to buy drinks and food.Spend at least 8 hours on a tour and you will love it !
113,Out of this world,"This is a magical place! Where ever you go you are amazed by nature and our the caves some of the first humans made, of course nature and weather have done their thing over thousands of years but it’s awesome all around. Beginning of November it’s definitely the best time a year to visit with a cool weather and not that many tourists, bring a mask or scarf lots of dust in the air."
114,Must see  while in Kapadokya!,"I guess a private tour and with a guide make the trip different.  We were lucky to have Moustafa from Pupa Travel as our guide, he is very knowledgeable and friendly.  He explain more about each caves and answered our questions about each caves.  The place itself is interesting, some caves showed the previous paintings of symbol used before Christianity."
115,Beautiful scenery,This is a must visit area. It will take your breath away. The cave dwellings are ingenious. Making dwellings out of rock is sheer genius
116,Walking on the Moon !,"The open air museum portion of this park was great!  There are numerous churches carved into the cliffs and fairy chimneys and inside are ancient frescoes and in one case, even a skeleton of an actual saint.  Climb the stairs and check them all out."
117,Sunset Horse ride ,Did this as part of a booked tour - great to visit but it gets super busy which means you're literally in and out of each room.
118,Awesome,"We did enjoy discovering Goreme National Park, which os in act in the open air. The kids loved going into the caves and wanted to spend the whole day vosting."
119,Most amazing place,"Booked 2 day trips conducted by the same company through my hotel, Carvanserai Hotel. Lucky enough to be conducted by same tour guide Mr Cemil Demircan. He was very professional and very informative on the places visited. With his experience, the group was very well organised and managed to always get to the various places of interest before most of the bus loads of tourists. He had made the trips interesting and with little time wasted on queues. Highly recommended tours conducted by the ATV!"
120,Fascinating Cave Churches,"Cappadocia is filled with delightful dwellings and 'churches' that are thousands of years old, each more fascinating than the next. This is one of the best. I'd highly suggest you use a local guide so you know where you are, where you''re going and what you're seeing. The whole Cappadocia area (which I believe is approximately 60 square miles) is worth exploring both by foot and car. An early-morning balloon is considered a must by many tourists, but we didn't do this and don't feel we missed out on experiencing the many marvels here. You can't see everything in a couple of days, but whatever you do see - even in a 1-day visit - will remain with you forever. The place is magical."
121,Recommend for everyone who visit Cappadocia ,"Unique landscape, not to be missed. Paved paths lead to entry to churches cut into the rocks, and great overlooks for photographs."
122,Great ,its a cool insight to the lifestyle that wasn't so long ago for the people that live in cappadocia. You can appreciate the raw living situation and great lengths they went to put a rood over their heads.
123,Beautiful,"This area is so beautiful and different. Take 2 or 3 days to explore the different valleys, and you will not regret it!"
124,Pictures can’t capture it,We had the opportunity to visit this open air museum on a recent trip to Turkey.The setting is stunning and the cave churches are amazing.  Inside each of the churches are frescoes depicting the teachings that the churches were used for.A great stop!
125,a must see,"We visited  Goreme in Oktober 2019. It was part of our honeymoon trip and we are still sad because we didnt spent at least couple days more at this magical place.We have heard about is before we came, we saw photos and videos, but believe me you cannot describe how beautiful this place is.It is perfect in September or October to visit since during the summer it is too hot.You can stay at cave hotels, visit open air museum, take one of the tours to visit couple more villages and underground cities and learn more about their tradition, culture and history of course. Prepare yourself to wake up early in the morning and visit Point of View place (ask locals) about directions and enjoy the view over the valley lighten by morning sun and hot air ballons."
126,Must see,"If you’ve got your own wheels or are in Gorëme, come yourself early morning or late afternoon. The part the tour companies take you to was super crowded. Amazing, amazing place though."
127,Valley walking gives the best impression,"What an amazing and unique landscape. When you consider that this method of living was first done en masse by the Hitites and so much of it still remains to this day having suffered earthquakes, floods etc.You have to come and experience the wonderfully innovative way that they built dwellings in the rocks going upwards and also underground cities going downwards using chisels and hard work!  Amazing! So happy that I chose to add this part to my recent tour of Caucasus."
128,Beautiful natural beauty ,Natural formations are simply amazing! A photographer’s dream! Kids will enjoy exploring this area too.
129,"amazing landscape, human craft","Goreme National Park is full of rocks, sand and caves.  A unique place to visit and with historical stories about the place in Turkish history.  It takes time to walk, take photos and travel around this place. Though summer is hot, many times wind to keep us dry."
130,A must see while in Cappadocia,"We came here as part of the Red Tour for 28 euros per person.  Our tour included the entrance fee of 45 tl.  Prepare to spend 1-2 hours here.We came late morning and it was already very crowded which made the experience not as enjoyable.  To view many of the rooms, prepare to line up.  And once you are inside, you are expected to keep moving with some rooms not allowed for photography.It is an interesting area but not the most interesting during our visit in Cappadocia."
131,History,"Walking amongst the cave houses and churches is the most amazing thing. You will get very hot as the stone all reflects the sun and heat, so take water to drink and a hat. You can clamber into various houses and churches - unlike anything else anywhere."
132,A must see place in Cappadocia,"It’s always crowded. You’ve read several reviews claiming that early morning was empty - this is quite inaccurate; even at 9am (opening time) the site was already packed with buses and tours, hence be patient.They do accept the Turkey Museum Pass which will also give you access to the church on the other side of the road and the Dark Church."
133,"plenty of hiking trails, and gorgeous scenery.",During my late September visit the place was fairly crowded with Chinese tourists scrambling all over the place. The painted frescoes in the rock churches were not that detailed and no photography was allowed with or without flash. It was interesting to see on the ground what we'd seen the day before from a hot air balloon.  Worth the visit
134,2019 Eid Holiday,Just marvelous!! Seeing creations like these reminds you of our Great Creator and His marvelous creations!!A must see!!
135,Magical,"AComing here is a like to a world of fantasy . All you have thought of a fairyland seems to be taking shape on ground. Well laid out over a large area strewn by rocky shapes and sizes which denies all structural imagination only to look awe inspiring.  Agog with tourists ,all the time of the year has an excellent township of Goreme which in itself is beautiful with affordable restaurant and shops of local artefacts and souvenirs . Mind boggling structures looks so beautiful from shapes so weird and incredulous that can only look so imaginative and attractive . A must see and icing in the cake for Cappadocia."
136,Challenging walk but wort the scenery,Goreme area of Cappadocia is enchanting and magical.  The classic scenes of fairy chimneys and carved out dwelling mesmerize visitors at every turn.  Truly a very special place!
137,Amazing trip (especially with jeep in tow),A must for Red tour& Green Tour are all day activities including lunch. You will see all attractive place of Goreme. and Balloon riding is a must as well.
138,"Wow, and that's a big Wow!!",This place is a must visit for travellers. No camera could capture the beauty of all the rock formations. It was a very unique experience for my friends and I. I wish to go back someday.
139,The Most Unique Landscape in the World,The Goreme museum is something out of this world. It is unbelievable to see how people lived in those stone structures. Not too much to walk and the heat is not as big a factor. They actually look better from outside than inside but do visit inside to see how people lived. Carry an umbrella during summer and a coat in winter... Weather can be a bit extreme...
140,The landscape and history will blow your mind.,"A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the largest open air museums in the world. Many number of rocks that were carved into churches, cafeterias and dormitories. Very fascinating to see the architecture. One giant rock with caves that was the male dorm and another giant rock for females.The churches have murals in their interiors. It's unfortunate that murals are eroding due to people either scratching them off, taking photos with flashes, and just sheer volume of tourists. The humidity caused by the breathing of tourists also contribute to the erosion. Although flash photography is not allowed, there were some ignorant tourists taking photos with flashes. So I informed the security sitting outside the entrance. There is one church that costs an extra 10-15TL to get in (I heard it has more well-preserved murals). It really is quite amazing to see a university carved into rocks that accommodated more than 2000 people studying the bible."
141,Nice,This is a beautiful place to visit with incredible rock formations. You will see beautiful scenery like no other. Simply amazing.
142,kapadokia national park very beautiful sunset and sunrise beautiful mountain very beautiful place old and historical  ,"The park is beautiful  with many picture perfect moments. Can visit caves with rustic furniture. has a little cafe where you can get something to eat and drink. Can also purchase little tokens and souvenirs from here,"
143,Good visit but gets very busy,"Very interesting area and great access. Can be busy, so morning might be the best option. Well maintained and easy walking. Parking is limited close by."
144,Goreme Open Akr Museum,A beautiful and historical area surrounded by valleys and filled with caves. Most of it is open for free for the public. It was an unusual and a unique experience for us.
145,Beautiful Open Air Park,"1. Listed on UNESCO2. Comprises of; Goreme Open Air Museum, Zelve, Urgup, Ortahisar, Uchisar. 3. Consider buying a Museum Card, it will be cheaper. 4. Travel by car.*Went on April and it was a snowy day so we couldn’t enjoy to the fullest. So if you like sunny days should check the weather before your trip, if possible."
146,Goreme National Park is brilliant.,"It's all a wonder, well worth going to see. This is on one of the tours we took and it was nice to be able to walk at our own pace and look at everything as long as we needed to."
147,Another attraction,"i think this place was quite useless, there was nothing inside that one can otherwise not see outside if they went for a hike. there were some glorifications of antiquity and religion related themes. i think it's unfair to charge for religion themed tourism. There is so much more history, structure and meaning to the caves we have in India. Not recommended and that too, on a hot summer day. i was exoevting the different kind of rock structures. they should have clearly named this as a Christian remains museum!"
148,Forgiveness of nature.,"Fascinated!Fascinateddddd!Did I mentioned that I am fascionated?!! I am 52 and I was never on other Planet. Till this May ;)MUST SEE in life! That is it. Must. I even must go again, baloooms did not fly :((So, just walk, ride a horse, car, whstever, but see the most you can!Everything is for photo. I made so many wonderful photos and much more memories, ofc. I like people also. Very gentle, not pushy, I am surprised more than I expected to be"
149,Top Attraction,"place where Christianity proliferated in times of great persecution. Wonderful place, with many man-made caves for shelter and hiding place."
150,Nice experencing how cave men stayed and dined etc but overrates specially steeply priced,"It is well-deserved as a top destination. It is a manageable size, so can walk around to see whatever interests you."
151,Quite overwhelming ,It is a place where history and spirituality show us in a wonderful way how people have lived centuries before in harmony with nature and God
152,Overrated,"Is interesting because is in open air...is like a big park. Is member of Unesco World Heritage since 1984, and is one of the first  two Unesco sites in Turkey.Is near Goreme village center...about 15 minutes walk. You must see it."
153,A Comic Book World,"It is great seeing the old, carved in stone houses, nice landscapes. Perfect place to forget about the city noises."
154,Amazing place,"Very nice and interesting place to visit. There is a very interesting story about that place, so you should read about it before visiting, or take a guide there. I would recommend to do it as a walking tour. If you use taxy you will probably miss a bunch of things. I was there at the beginning of May and the temperature was ~30°C."
155,Breathtaking Park,Absolutely stunning! We had a wonderful time and will love to do It again. Great opportunity for pictures and the guide was wonderful
156,Wonderful ,"A beautiful and enigmatic place with plenty of history.  Lovely frescos in the churches that were carved out of the rock.  As can be expected it is very busy with tourists.  It is an exposed site so take care in hotter weather and take with you a hat, sun protection and water."
157,Unique & fascinating,The most incredible rock formations unique to this region On our tour with reliable travel we saw 4 different valleys from above at stunning lookout points and among the rocks by small hiking trips. Quite spectacular
158,One of so many amazing places,Full of churches in caves. Dont miss the amazing one half way down the hill on the right on the way back to the car park. They dont let you take pictures of the best church cave paintings which is a shame. There is a cafe at the top. A fair amount of steps. I was irritated to pay my entrance fee and then expected to pay more to go in one of the sites. You cant get to see two of the main rock areas which I think I recall being the monestry and nunnery areas. Interesting place though and well worth seeing. Expect it to be swamped with tourists.
159,Day 1 of 3,What a wonderful place - if you told me it was the moon I would believe you.  The stone colours and formations are amazing and it goes on for miles and miles.  A great place to visit and wander around and with a glorious history as well.
160,Unique Geology,"The Open Air Museum is walking distance from Goreme downtown. As of writing January 2019, ticket price at 45TL. Opens at around 8am. 1-2 hours is enough to see the place. The place is nice to see in winter and have a different view of these rock formation. A must see in Cappadocia."
161,Remarkable,some historical churches within the volcanic rocks. you can see some paintings inside the churches but mostly are damaged.
162,great to see how they lived,"We spent our holidays in Side and had the opportunity to fly to Kayseri (one our flight from Antalya) and visit  Goreme National Park in Cappadocia. A must see attraction, located in the heart of Turkey, with unsual rock formations, valley, canyon as a resul of the eroding rains and winds of thousand years. Undrground cities, mushroom shaped formations, amazing natural wonders and fascinating history."
163,Wonderful place to visit,Touched down in Cappadoyka  in the nite and freezing cold .An unbelievable alien terrain which continued into and from a hit air balloon ride.A totally surprising landscape.Makes one wonder if they are in the right planet.A must ..a different experience altogether. There are many ways to view this area..jeep safaris tours etc
164,Awesome,We were on the tour of the day.   This was a Very memorable tour to see abd experience such rich history and learn so much of the place and its importance.  A must visit for all
165,Capadocia gorem open air museum,This is a must-see place in Turkey. It has lots and lots of strange rock formation. Many came here to ride hot air balloon.
166,North and East Turkey,"I spent about 2 hours visitin there, it's beautiful and has amazing views. Def recommend ! I visted with the Green Tour."
167,Nicely maintained but most of the murals are not in a good condition,"Very interesting , well worth a trip, we went on a private tour, our guide was friendly and very knowledgeable, and spoke excellent English"
168,Other Planet! ;),"This a beautiful area which has a lot of the cave dwellings in which the ancients used to live. Our guide showed us the areas where they used to cook their food and the refectory where they used to sit and eat together. He also showed us lot of churches in this region and we visited a lot of these churches with exotic names such as Apple Church, St. Barbara Church, Snake Church & Dark Church (Karanlık Kilise) where the frescoes are preserved beautifully as the church did not have any natural light - additional ticket of 10TL.I was impressed by how the monks used to live in ancient times and how well planned they were. Can easily spend 2 hours in this place exploring."
169,Excellent,The whole area is full of fascinating sites and history. The area attracts a lot of visitors but there is space for everyone and loads of activities from walking to hot air ballooning. Great for kids and adults alike. Must visit if in the area.
170,Another Planet,"What a beautiful guided horse outride through the mountains with my wife... Magical sunset as you take in the atmosphere..After a morning balloon ride over the valley, this was a perfect way to see the valley up close and personal on horseback"
171,Cappadocia's highlight!,"Goreme open air museum, which consists of  ruins of number of monasteries, churches and houses carved into volcanic rock mountains. It is now UNESCO World Heritage site. Wear comfortable shoes for the visit, is you will have to both walking and some climbing. Some of the churches have frescoes which are worth seeing."
172,Fabulous place,Pretty cool place to visit and see the fairy chimney.  gets pretty busy with tour groups but still fun to explore
173,"As with most of the sites in this area, just amazing.",I was shocked after I paid & went to get an audio guide that I had to leave my passport.  I don't carry my passport on me and there is no way that I would leave it with them!  I offered money but the girl was very very rude and ended up ignoring me and started talking to the next person.  I haven't been treated like this anywhere!  I also couldn't believe that you had to pay to get into another church- crazy.  We were in and out within an hour and had no idea what we looked at!
174,Amazing Panoramic View,"Spent half a day in this beautiful spot. Lots to look at, so much history! Beautiful churches with intricate paintings."
175,Open air spoilt by the large tourist groups.,"I went here with my family. Most museums including this one in Turkey are over prices and so not worth it. Otherwise it is a nice and different experience where you get to picture how little ancient men lived, slept, dined, cooked in caves"
176,Beautiful valleys and rock formations,"October is perfect weather for visiting. National Park is a natural show. Kids love so much. Walking around and climbing to caves was easy for kids. Definitely very clean and people are very helpful. Better to have MuseumCard. Even free for kids you need FreeCard for them. Apart from Main entrance, on the way (just 50m away from parking) one more cave which one is the best for me."
177,Worth seeing but not the best,"We like it very much. Be careful, very slippery stones. Very interesting paintings on te walls of churchis."
178,Amazing natural park,"The geology of this region has to be seen to be believed.  It is just wonderful.  If I got a dollar for every time I said Wow I’d be a millionaire.  Pictures don’t do it justice, walking amongst the rock formations and flying over on a ballon gave me a real appreciation of the uniqueness of this region."
179,Great view,"Nice place. If u r staying in Goreme about 20 mins walking distance because public buses is an hour scheculed. Entrance fee is 45 TL. And it till take about 1-1,5 hour to take tour. Nice place with full of history"
180,Also Known as Goreme Open Air Museum,"The landscape throughout the Goreme National Park are other worldly and totally unique.  Formed over millions of years and used by generations since 6000BC, it is truly a World Heritage Area,"
181,wonderland,"We have forty national and over three hundred nature park but Göreme is very different&unique maybe not in Anatolia but also in the world with fairy chimneys, churches, under ground cities, hot baloon activity, Sema, Turkish Nights, making pottery shows and very delicios wines and countless dreams..."
182,Otherworldly landscape,"We walked through the park and were impressed by all the history. The rock formations are out of this world. The rock dwellings are fascinating. The walk seemed short as we kept looking, taking photos and exploring. Well worth the visit"
183,Its nice but gets repetitive ,Wonderfully organised area to observe the cave dwellings and get a beautiful view of surrounding area!
184,Stunning frescos but badly run,Loved every minute of my time and my next trip will be for 2 weeks driving a rented car and not public transport.
185,Wander,Short walk and a must see.  Amazing. Go later in the day because the busses arrive early and it can be packed.
186,must go,Fascinating place but overcrowded.  We went on a very hot day and completed the tour in 90 minutes due to having to queue to get into some features.
187,Worth the visit,Göreme Open Air Museum is a magnificent open air park for the tour. Many caves are great for exploring. It is good to see “churches” in some of these caves.
188,A must see,"Had a wonderful time at the Goreme National Park in Turkey, and was mesmerised by the awe inspiring rock formations.A complete one day visit to this great national park, with different observation points in the Pigeon Valley, Urchisar Castle , with a Jeep Safari and a Hot Air Balloon ride created a lasting memory of this beautiful Cappadocia region in Turkey.The famous fairy chimney land is created after a volcanic eruption, and the rock formations were formed by the forces of nature through the erosion by the wind and rain condition. A ride by hot air balloon into the air to see the vast area from the sky is an exceptional experience.Our jeep safari brought us into the Rose Valley and we could see more of the unique  rock formations in this area.A visit to the Kaymakli Underground City showcased the life and living conditions in the subterranean chamber of the people with the construction of cellars, church, and kitchen in those tunnels. This is the main highlight of anyone's visit to Turkey. To save time, it would be great to fly to the Cappadocia region with two airports nearby. They are Kayseri and Nevsehir Airport."
189,Enduring Faith,Amazing place and really breathtaking views.harmony of  nature and history. Take a long time to explore and end enjoy ...
190,Interesting ,"This was the first attraction for us to visit, so maybe we were more impressed about the rocky and dry scenery here, then in the others places we visit after. We didn't tag along with groups but still it was rather crowded, because museum is actually smaller then we initially thought (it seemed overwhelmingly big). Overall a nice experience (nature mixed with stories)"
191,Must visit,There are many interesting hikes through this fascinating landscape and a lot of history and relics as well.
192,Interesting and Unusual,This is a must see as the history is great but i think there are 2-3 caves which are amazing and the paintings are unbelievable but after them they all look pretty much the same...empty caves with black roofs from the cooking. It gets very busy with bus loads of people and school trips so get there early or go between 1-2 as thats when the buses have lunch. It has beautiful views but 1 hour 30 mins is more then enough to spend here
193,Fascinating place,"Depend when you travel, it can get very hot and crowded. However, mornings are excellent. Good walking shoes will make the difference with bottled water at hand. Guides are plentiful - we did not use one but found excellent write ups on the internet which sufficed to help us in this place which is marked."
194,Number 1 in Turkey,"We went in July and it was stunning, but brace yourself cause it was hot. There are however several spots you can go to to get a drink or snack if you need. Lol You can get some epic shots at this spot too. You can also visit the Dark Church that is there, although, personally I felt that it was a bit overrated. It’s a really small space, and there’s are guards there including in each of the other caves keeping a watchful eye on photographers. They don’t want you to take pictures, cause that might ruin the frescos....however, you can sneak a pic or two if they are nice. Lol"
195,One of highlights of the visit to Cappadocia ,We did horse riding through the national park and just loved it. The park is a must visit for the amazing landscape and horizons. The best views and sights of Cappadocia are all within the park
196,So busy! ,"Step back in time and imagine what it may have been like, living a spiritual life in these carved out fairy chimneys. The frescoes are fascinating. This area is like no other place on earth. You may not think you are. Do a hot air ballon ride...trust me, you will never regret it!"
197,Fairyland!,The rock formations are not like any other that I have seen.  And to think that Christians carved out housing and underground tunnel to escape the Romans is remarkable.
198,Wonderful Place to Visit ,We experienced a balloon ride over the National Park what an amazing spectacular of landscapes... the chimneys of sandstone the Forrest of greenery pine trees...we were there at sunrise it is beautiful definitely visit the national park.
199,NICE BUT BUSY,"It was snowing during our visit since there was weather anomaly in Cappadocia. The view was quite amazing as if it was from one of the locations on Game of Thrones. The stairs leading to the chapels inside the caves were pretty narrow with no handrail in several spots along the stairs. There was only one way to enter and to exit making it quite crowded at times. As it was snowing during our time there, the stairs become slippery too. You surely need to wear suitable shoes for walking as you need to go through quite a few flight of stairs to visit the ancient chapels inside the cave.Also be mindfull of the narrow stairs if you are travelling with young children and/or elderly people.Please noted that ut is forbidden to take pictures inside the cave due to risk of the camera flash damaging the centuries old painting in chapel's wall. Kindly only take pictures when you are outside of the caves.There were several cafes and souvenir shop inside the open air museum. The price was quite the standard of tourist attraction."
200,So much to see and do!,A magnificent park with the very strange rocky structures not found in any part of the world. The rocks are very complex with 3 levels formed over thousands of years
201,A dream called Goreme,"Short walk and a must see. Amazing. Beautiful natural beauty.in the rocks, there are houses... ıts so cool"
202,Stunning place,"Goreme is also know center of Cappadoccia, it host some of the most beautiful and significant historic places for the Christianity (where the first Christian settle after running away from the Romans) really amazing place."
203,Very interesting place this. ,Instamatic opportunities all around! It’s so interesting seeing these places that were carved out for dwellings hundreds of years ago.
204,Amazing scenery,"Goreme national park is the central area of Goreme and is lovely to walk around. Restaurants and hotels dot this area, along with the fairy chimneys, making it one of the most unique landscapes you will ever see. The hot air balloons in the morning make it even prettier. A once in a lifetime visit!"
205, ,"After the drive from the airport and commentary by our guide, this was our first taste of the actual churches and dwellings of the region.  The shows on TV did not prepare us for how large and extensive this region and the number of carved volcanic tufa structures.  Highly recommended, but try to avoid times when the big tour buses hit."
206,Green and Red tour conducted by ATV,The place is obviously nice but the queue for the tickets are very long and the guides are consistently breaking the queue to buy large numbers of tickets.
207,a must to visit,"such a fascinating place and to think that people have lived there for centuries makes it even more interesting. the history of the place, being able to walk around and look was lovely. our guide made it even more interesting with all the information he shared"
208,Stunning and unique,"It an amazing heritage, beautiful landscape and so unique place to visit. Every cave is a masterpiece of the nature that you should see for sure."
209,Awesome place,"So, we took part in a tour (Red Tour), which covered the main landmarks of North Cappadocia and Goreme Open Air Museum was one of the stops. It is an amazing place, like a miracle of the nature, the home of many monasteries and chapels built by the Christians that populated the area starting with the 3rd century.There is also a very nice place, built in the rocks where we had Turkish coffee. If you want to buy specific Turkish sweets (such as Turkish delight) do it from Goreme not from there. You will find more sortiments at better prices. However Goreme Open Air Museum is worth visiting for the view and the culture it has to offer."
210,Nice,The area is covered in snow and the views are stunning. Peaceful and enjoyable with less crowds to enjoy all the scenery and history. Everyone is warm and friendly and willing to chat over a cup of tea.
211,Good visit !,"While we have seen similar geological landscapes elsewhere in the world, what is most impressive here is the tremendous concentration of man-made underground structures.  There are multiple underground early Christian churches, monasteries, and hundreds of residences concentrated in a fairly small area. It takes some hiking up and down hilly paths to see the largest ones, and plenty of patience to deal with the hordes of foreign tourists.  The paintings and decorations in the most important churches are deteriorating badly, but still visible and quite impressive.  Do not miss!"
212,Wander around,"Totally worth the spending on a jeep with driver, to bring us to panoramic spots to take photos with the majestic backdrops. Set off from our hotel at 5am and back at 7am. A well worth 2 hours of phototaking at a spot which forms part of my bucket list. Cost us USD 110 per pax. You may be able to find cheaper fares elsewhere as we booked ours through a group tour operator."
213,Definitely worth a visit!,What an outstanding place to be. A fairy tale originating out of the Persian stories with fairy chimneys 360 degrees and thick colorful clouds of balloons flying over your head. Rose valley on one side calling out loud beautiful colors of stone with a sprinkle of rain..... beautiful turkey always do not seize to amaze me.....
214,Very nice experience,Most probably there is no other place as interesting as Capadoccia. It was in winter when I visit and we have chance to see this place fully white under snow.
215,Breathtaking and totally unique landscape,"We were in the area a couple of days, very cool area to explore. We found the open air museum hardly worth as much as just walking the area for free"
216,Must be,"Lovely place to go hiking and climbing. Bring lots of water, apply sunblock, wear a hat, light jacket if you don’t like the sun beating down on your skin, and at least wear sneakers. Have fun!"
217,Reasons to visit Cappadocia,This was an amazing place to visit! There's so much history and it was quite meaningful to see the various churches hidden in the rocks. Make sure you're wearing proper shoes with good traction. There's a lot of climbing and you need good footing to get around the various structures.
218,No need to pay for  open air museum,"Hard to pick a favorite here, I expected to be bored of seeing stones after the first valleys but it was not the case, each canyon had a different feeling and deeply enjoyed the area. A very unique and special area."
219,I want to visit,Life is beautiful when one wanders and gazes at the simple details that make everything look spectacular and unique.
220,Worth the trip,"a unique place , it is very nice to wonder around and watch the amazing caves built in huge rocks and know the history of it A guide will be very helpful ."
221,The Open Air Museum is fascinating.,The Goreme National park is a place of surprising natural beauty that is enhanced by human adaptation. The area is marked for easy roaming around but we opted for a guide which helped a lot in explaining the area.
222,Must See!!,#delicousfood#friendlypeople#beautifulnature#restgood#if you want to be there prepare from now. #lovetravel
223,"Stunning Vistas, Lots of Culture & History","We went here as part of a ""red"" tour and were captivated with the sights like all the other crowds....  you need to expect the crowds as its such an iconic sight. The frescos in the churches are steeped in history and well worth seeing.Unless your very early or late in the afternoon your unlikely to avoid the crowds but I still feel it's well worth the visit."
224,Like a fairy tale,Amazing what locals created over 1000 years ago.  Multiple churches with frescoes have survived .  The history is palpable with every step.  A must see while in Cappadocia.
225,Beautiful open air museum,"The Goreme National Park is a UNESCO world heritage site.   The park is surrounded by stunning little towns with top class accommodation,  restaurants and activities. The park is a large area made up of canyons and valleys with old cave houses and churches scattered all over the place.Long, medium or short walks.  Easy, medium or difficult terrain with panoramic view points everywhere. A masterclass of nature with fresh air and friendly locals.  Cappadokya is a special place made all the more pleasant by warm Turkish hospitality.My second visit to the area.  Last time in summer, this time in winter.  Both truly eye opening.  A genuine source of inspiration. An easy 1 hour plane trip from Istanbul.  A walkers paradise with literally tons of stuff to do."
226,Very interesting.,"With hindsight, we should have gone earlier but we were jaded after our balloon trip. A nice museum but it's absolutely heaving (even at 1000 am) with large groups of tourists. The churches are - unsurprisingly - small so it can get a bit frustrating to get around. Dark Church was closed but the frescoes in the other churches, including Sandal Church, were amazing given that they're over 1000 years old. Signposting could be improved. Don't miss Buckle Church which is down the hill about 100m"
227,amazing landscape,I had no idea this natural formation were so spread and numerous. It is truly impressive and our guide Ahmed made our tour magical!
228,Stunning Winter views,kapadokia national park very beautiful sunset and sunrise beautiful mountain very beautiful place old and historical  location you can enjoying a lot
229,Local Guide to Goreme and Dervish Dances Info,"Pictures can’t do justice to the majesty of this landscape.  The ash and lava rock has created a unique visual not found anywhere else that I have seen.  While local tour guides state the landscape was created 30 million years ago, it was obviously created during and shortly after Noah’s flood, which both Christianity and Islam believe."
230,Must visit ,Very beautiful natural landscape! It's quite an experience to visit this area! I'm very happy I did it!
231,Special place,"It was not that easy walking around this national park as it was ups and downs, and steeps at some parts. However, the scenery we saw was worth the walk. It was a nature at its best!"
232,Trip to Turkey with Mr.Osman Ozmen,"This was an amazing place to learn about geology and the history of our region.   We hired a guide for the day and he made it come alive.  Unfortunately, it is over-run with bad tourists just trying to take selfies.   They didn’t respect the property and were more interested in their ego pictures.   It was hard to enjoy completely with all of the bad behavior."
233,Must to see when in Cappadocia.,"Such a beautiful place! I could just sit and look around for hours. However, do avoid it during the summer! It was unbelievably hot and busy."
234,Amazing Rock Formation,during the summer is preferable to go and do some hiking and take water because it gets hot. the hiking scenario is amazing and gorgeous. plenty of caves to see and check out.
235,A must visit when in Cappadocia ,A must. Everything about Cappadocia is just pure magic. The energy shared in the city is mind blowing. This is one of the best places to see and get lost
236,Marvelous!!,We were amazed to see rock cut churches and how it must be colonised in old times. Well worth of 45 lira spent as admission fees and 2-3 hours of time.Facility management should work there a bit more in snowy conditions as people were slipping due to hardened snow. There were no pavements or salt sprayed on roads to make safe walking around.
237,Amazing ,"These unusual rock formations known as “fairy chimneys.” These natural wonders are augmented by the cultural heritage of the region’s inhabitants, who as far back as the third century hewed homes, churches and entire underground cities into the landscape.Goreme National Park is on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Surely it is a must visit."
238,Nice place to visit - long crowd at the ticket selling point,I really enjoyed walking around and paid the extra to see inside the church. It's like nothing else I've ever seen.
239,Reviews,"This place is amazing, the landscape is totally unique and the scene is enhanced nearly every morning by upwards of 150 hot air balloons making the whole experience surreal. It's worth driving around the surrounding area as there are so many different vistas to see. The town of Goreme itself is charming and the many restaurants varied and cheap."
240,Another Turkish Surprise,So many mosques but this was one of the only churches in the area.  The markings and structure are so clear.
241,I was expecting to see better paintings..,It is a must do for tourists because it is popular for its chimneys and most photographed areas. It is good place with lots of tourists making noise and poses;) we had a nice time and nice pictures.
242,Stunning frescos,"This area of Turkey presents this amazing rock formations that turn into the oddest shapes, such as camels, dolphins, etc. Is an astounding experience"
243,Cappadokya ,Given that the whole area is due to volcanic activity millenia ago it is fascinating to see the shapes that the weather and temperatures have created.
244,History to be seen,due to eid it was really crowded however we enjoyed a lot with my family.. definitely we suggest all region to see amazing environment
245,worth visiting,"This was an unreal experience, great for kids of all ages as well, it's a must do in Goreme.If you ever go to Goreme, be sure not to miss this"
246,A must see,"Fabulous - not beautiful, maybe a little too otherworldly for that.  Amazing scenery and views - a little like being on Mars or another planet."
247,Mjeh,It is the place I wanted to see from some time.It was like in my expectation:strange shapes of rocks turns into places to live. I admired once again the skills of ancient people to find solutions for survive in very difficult circumstances and climatic conditions.And I appreciated the well preserved area of GoremeNational Park.
248,"historical site, unique landscape",I'm thinking of visiting here. I found positive comments and good feedback that it is such a nice place. Turkey really is a beautiful country
249,Be Careful of Camel Service In Front of the Museum,"It was covered with snow, lovely look from the outside but this place is know for its monastery and the drawings and history, we have a good guide that tells the story well, but the drawings on the wall... it’s disappointing. Also, saying this might be a little weird, I was astonished by the effort that that people put in for the sake of vandalising the “snake” church drawings. I mean it’s 3-4m above ground and they decided to climb to leave their name there... Honestly I was pretty angry at these nuts, whoever they are/ were."
250,"Wonderfull Place,",We had a good time wandering around this place and get up close and personal with the rock formation. Does require some lec of fitness if you want to see everything. You do have to pay extra to see the dark church which we did not
251,Very Scenic and Unique Open Air Museum,A great place to wander around and look at all of these wonderful natural rock formations.  We were able to go inside one of them and see how people live.
252,Unique open-air museum,"We went on 10 days 7 nite to Eastern Turkey. It was a package tour organised by Chan brothers.The tour guide was Mr.Osman Ozmen.It was winter time and our !st time to Turkey and 1St winter exprience.The trip was made memorable by exprienced and knowledgeable tour guide who planned the trip well.Ensure we could have well exprienced in all our sites we visited.Always there to guide us.We visited Istanbul, the place for the famous Blue Mosque,Hippodrome, Tokapi palace, the grand bazaar and Spice bazaar.The trip to Bosphorus Cruise was organised at the right time in the evening. It was a lovely sight.Cappadocia was a fairy tale come true, with the beautiful 29 rock-cut churches .Pamukkale where u can have termal bath, which is very refreshing.It also looks like we are in the mid of the clouds.Canakkale looks like a beautiful island surronded by sea and beaches.Thank you Mr.Osman to be patient and understanding to show us the beauty of Eastern Turkey.A good guide is important for a dream come true.Mr.Osman has all the good qualities of a good guide.Always punctual, Strong communication skills, Personable ad outgoing, Improvisational skills,The good knowledge of the places and Passion for theeir city which made our trip success. We will definetly visit turkey again"
253,Unique,"The chimneys are a sight to behold, such a place. Such natural beauty. It is a privilege to be able to visit."
254,Unique,You can see the rock formations in tonnes of other place where they currently don't charge you. There were tonnes of tourists getting in the way of photos and it really wasnt overly impressive. Save your money.
255,So much history...,beautiful place.  for different types of trip.  unique landscape.very good food in restaurants and lots of shops
256,Don’t miss ,"I do see the error of my ways - with out previous research a rather unimpressive place. So I would highly concider hiring a guide, there are plenty of them already there and one even approached us. Being Estonian I don't like people talking to me, so we said no. Kinda regret it. Caves are interesting, but after seeing one you've kinda seen them all, at least when you know nothing about them. So solo 5/10. With a guide? Well he did promise a 100% satisfaction guarantee..."
257,Beautiful but hot!,It is a hypnotizing place. We got a vehicle rental in off season and it was an incredible method to investigate the district and keeping away from enormous visit gatherings.
258,Unforgettable place,Take a walk to the park and walk up close to some stones. Make sure the weather is nice and sunny. It is on the way to the open air museum.
259,Peaceful and beautiful,It is a mesmerizing place. We got a car rental in off season and it was a great way to explore the region and avoiding large tour groups.
260,Magic,"This was an amazing experience, a unique landscape and rich history unlike anywhere else in the world."
261,Lovely Christian History at Goreme National Park,This is an astonishing sight. Definitely justified even despite the walk however pick your time as it can get very hot in the sands. Extremely beautiful and some extraordinary photography choices. Try not to miss this.
262,Absolutely amazing place,amazing indeed lots of pictures shooting not much walk  but many unique sites worth to take interesting pictire
263,Unbelievable!,"Just an amazing place unfortunately the Chinese were on mass constantly taking pictures of themselves,,,"
264,Lovely Open Museum ,This is a very scenic and beautiful place.  We enjoyed the great views and have a good time exploring the caves.  Picture perfect place.
265,Sometimes called Goreme Open Air Museum,"Goreme Open Air Museum, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, contains the finest rock-cut earliest churches in history. Within some churches are beautiful frescoes. Unfortunately, many of them are in poor condition and one can barely make out what they depict. The structures have weathered well. The living quarters, churches, and other areas are relatively fine and most are open to visitors."
266,Awesome scenery with fascinating history,This is an amazing sight. Well worth the walk but pick your time as it can get quite hot in the sands. Very picturesque and some great photography options. Do not miss this.
267,Beautiful,"amazing place, culture, cave, rocks, incridible, how they did everything.I would recommend it for everyone"
268,WOW!!,"guys wonderful place to see, i can not belive this nature and people are really kind. Turkey has lots of beuty."
269,A must do once in Goreme ,"great place to see fairy chimneys up close. plus you see so much historically important way to living, during the olden days.it just blows your mind. a must do in cappadocia for sure"
270,interesting monastic christian cities carved into stone,This is around 20 minutes walk from Goreme center but it is worth every minute.  The complex is huge and consists of a series of cave churches.  The most preserved church paintings are situated in a cave church for which an additional fee has to be paid.  But it is worthwhile.
271,Natural wonder tour,Amazing view and history. You can not find the place like this in other world. My family is enjoy it.
272,First stop in Goreme,An absolute necessity. Everything about Cappadocia is simply unadulterated enchantment. The vitality partook in the city is mind blowing. This is probably the best spot to see and get lost
273,"don't miss this experience, just go for it","After exiting Goreme National Park, my sister and I were attracted with cute camels sitting in front of the parking lots. We asked for a price casually. The guys there who we talked to inform two options of camel experience: to go for one round camel ride and to take a picture stand still with a camel. We did not even decide, discussing what option we wanted. All of the sudden, the guys approached me from the back and lifted me up without my permission, putting me on top of the camel (I was wearing a super short skirt and everyone can see my panties inside). I was screaming. Another guy lifted my sister up to another camel right beside me. The guys pulled camels for a walk. They asked for my phone to take pictures for 2 mins. It was very forceful and we both had to end up paying money for both ride and picture. THIS IS A SCAM. And it left us with a horrifying feeling after visiting Goreme museum. I wish this service is being taken down because not only it scams tourist on a regular basis, the camels there are very old, unhappy, aggressive and treated poorly. This service gives me the wrong impression of Turkish people and I think the government should take time and examine this because the service is right in front of the national museum and innumerably levies so many people."
274,Stupendous,This place is simply amazing . I do not think there is elsewhere like this anywhere in the world. You see cave Churches - apparently one for  Everyday of the year . The paintings on the walls inside are awesome . This is a photographer’s paradise . There are some steps but nothing too steep . Expect to spend 2-3 hrs here taking photos.
275,Natural beauty unfolds,"We had a superb morning here, although it was crowded. However the highlights were the ceilings in the church for which you have to pay a small additional fee. They are well worth it."
276,A nice discovery ,"Very interesting to see all the natural rocks formation. This place is out of the world. Can be hot during summers so sunblocks, hats/caps and rehydrate yourself!"
277,Worth seeing but a guide might be worthwhile ,"Its huge place, having beautiful view, rich on history as well. However there are many places that is not allowed for photography. Recommended to go with tour guide since you will get an explanation about the history."
278,Amazing History,This place feels pretty unique. The rock formations are beautiful and the churches are interesting too. It is quite big and you can easily spend hours there just wandering around and enjoying the atmosphere.
279,Amazing fairy chimneys and rock formations,"We went there last week and it was snowing, the scenery was mesmerizing and it is very rich in culture and historical sights."
280,Unbelievable!,Very amazing place how human could utilize this kind of natural. All construction by nature are very impressive.
281,Great history,the place is extraordinary amazing and its just like Kandovan village in IRAN ... i had kots of walking and hiking there . and also it is better to go for a walk on early morning
282,Its worth a visit ,It was a nice park but it got too tiring trekking through all of it. Had to take plenty of breaks to complete it. It was hot as well.
283,Best place to see how this earth was formed over the last million years through a common eye.,"We had done pigeon valley & love valley in the morning and we we're quite tired so at first this seemed extra, but we went since our hotel staff suggested it so strongly. We meandered around the open air museum and were amazed at the state of the some of the frescos, the place is very well kept & you should visit the UNESCO site."
284,Amazing landscapes,"We hiked around the various valleys covering about 16 miles on total. The are a whole bunch of valleys to choose from, red, rose, white aka love valley, pidgeon and probably many more that we didn't see.Is is worth doing some of the view points and also spending sometime in the valleys for close ups.Do a little research before you come to decide what you want to see.There are also red, blue a green tours which take in particular sites, but doing it that way you have to go at the guides speed and rarely get closer than a view point."
285,UNESCO World Heritage Site! Beautiful!,Beautiful to seeThe old church and the way the old people use to live. Winery and things like that. Loved it
286,Great,"I had thought November was low season! We got there at around 9.10am and it wasn’t too crowded, but by the time we walked halfway through the park it was overrun by busloads of tourists. Place is a must go to understand and see the cave living in the past. Would still try to go. Paid 136TL for 3 persons."
287,They should learn some customer service,We enjoyed our stay here learning about the history of the area and walking around the chimney rocks.
288,Amazing landscape and scenery,Even without the balloons it has a great view. Since the weather was so bad we couldnt fly with the balloons we had much time to visit a lot of places. Goreme National Park it's beautiful and when you have a smart tour guard you can learn a lot about history
289,No need for a full day tour,"I am a 61year old lady traveling with a slightly disabled daughter for the first time. I had a very pleasant and memorable trip thanks to our guide, Nasim and driver Hussein. Nasim was very accommodating and knowledgeable. They even took us to the Grand Mountains, the name I have forgotten. Nasim did mention it several times.I am also very grateful to Sedunia Travels for arranging the itinerary with special care . Thank you so much."
290,Amazing!,İt was a whole heaven out there we had a lof of fun there no matter how the weather is cold or hot its beautiful in every season
291,Very interesting,"The unique terrain is a result of volcanic activity and wind erosion over centuries. Rock cut churches and dwellings, pigeon caves, fairy chimneys and valleys dot the area. Amazing work of nature. A sight to behold"
292,Stunning landscapes ,The pointy mountain are so awesome... Just magical as it it's placed... It's a must visit place.. They have red tour n green tour.. This is part of red.. With us aprox 32$pp with lunch open air museum and pottery work shop
293,Just go there and see for yourself.,"Head there first thing in the morning or after 4pm. Even better, head out for hikes to red and rose valley to see frescos without the maddening, camera click happy crowds and listen to the birds. Divine."
294,Fascinating geology,"Goreme national park covers the entire area from Nevsehit to Urgup. The whole area are so unique, beautiful and so different compared to other national parks in the world.The region has been inhabited more than 2000 years. Since pre Christian period, people has been living in this place because of good location, very secure and mild weather.However, the most interesting part of this area is the distinct rock formation which has many kinds of rock shape. The center of the national park is mainly in Goreme, Urgup and Avanos.Three days is the minimum days to spend in this area. Lots of activities can be done like hot air balloon which is a must, atv ride, horseriding and etc.I would highly recommend this place and rated as number one attraction in Turkey. A place not to be missed while in Turkey"
295,Great visit!,"A lot of churches dates back to 7th century is located in this area. They were carved in chimneys. Great place to spend an afternoon. Make sure to have sunscreen, sun is very strong in this area."
296,Dark church was by far the favorite,"Göreme National Park (Turkish: Göreme Tarihî Milli Parkı) protects nearly 100 km2 (39 sq mi) of rocky, water- and wind-eroded landscape with a network of ancient, interconnecting underground settlements; it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Volcanic eruptions 3 to 9 million years ago from nearby Mount Hasan and Mount Erciyes deposited layers of basalt and thick beds of tuff (volcanic ash solidified into a soft rock).   Since then, erosion has carved the area into a spectacular landscape of plateaus and high hills, dissected by streams and steep-sided river valleys.  In places where the soft tuff is overlain by hard lava there is a fantastic landscape of multi-colored cliffs, rock towers, pillars, tent rocks and fairy chimneys.  With only 38cm of precipitation each year, there is little vegetation except in the river bottom lands.  Early settlers carved the soft tuff into dwellings, stables, storehouses, and places of worship.  The earliest Christian monasteries in the area  were the 4th century anchorite communities, following the teachings of Basileios the Great, Bishop of Kayseri, Turkey.  Monks and nuns inhabited cells carved in the rock and offered religious services in tiny churches.   Later, the communities took refuge together in underground villages to avoid attacks by marauding Arabs.  Three of the most-visited areas in the park near Göreme are:-- Göreme Open Air Museum (just east of town), with cave churches and frescoes from the 10th to 12th centuries. -- Uçhisar Castle (southwest of town), a fortification carved into a large outcrop, with panoramic views from the top. -- The landscape at Paşabağ Valley (north of town) is known for its “fairy chimneys,” (cone-shaped rock formations).There are hiking trails and back-country roads allowing exploration of the more remote areas.  Viewing the area from a hot air balloon at dawn is a sublime experience. Water, sturdy foot gear and a guide are recommended if you venture into the back country.  The park is open at all times with no entry fee."
297,history and nature merges,"The whole goreme region is made up of special landscape by volcanic eruption and wind erosion over the thousands of years. They have taken various shapes and they have been named imaginatively like chimney, peacock, camel and what not. The whole thing is very very interesting and absolutely worth visiting."
298,A great walk in this UNESCO site,"This whole place, the whole region is unbelievable. It is so so so mesmerizing. Feels like I have been transported into another world."
299,Awesome historical UNESCO site,"Göreme is a town in the Cappadocia region of central Turkey. Just east of town is the Göreme Open Air Museum, with cave churches and frescoes from the 10th to 12th centuries. Southwest is Uçhisar Castle, a fortification carved into a large rock, with panoramic views from the top. To the north, the landscape at Paşabağ Valley is known for Cappadocia’s “fairy chimneys,” cone-shaped rock formations."
