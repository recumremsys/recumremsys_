11,Majestic temple - worth a visit.,"What a remarkable Har Krishna Temple in Bangalore, India! On our drive to this great temple there were 7 cows who owned the road by crossing to the other side on their own sweet time! Cows are revered as sacred animals in this country and as I was patiently waiting, I thought how cool for these sacred cows to pass by as I'm on my way to the temple! When we arrived, we had to remove socks and shoes before entering. It does cost a small amount of money to enter, so my guide lead me all the way! I needed to wash my face, hands and feet! Then we began taking the steps up to the entrance. I counted each one. At different times we went into small areas to pray, as I watched and said my own prayers, I watched, then asked why he did certain movements such as hands, laying on the ground, placing his forehead on the wall, etc. My guide explained everything to me. I was curious about everything, but never minded me asking. We went up more steps, then more prayers. Then pictures of the outside of this beautiful building made if concrete, marble and gold! After the 120 step, we entered an amazingly large room with men and women in prayer giving respect. No pictures were allowed to be taken inside. So I refrained out of due respect. I saw Beautiful paintings, art in gold, and so many statues. We followed a line of people and I gave money as if I were in church giving my tigths to God. I received coupons at entrance to purchase a book, which was in English. They have in several languages. The book I chose to purchase was a vegetarian cookbook! After this we were given a spoon of water to drink. Then we went into other rooms like a small museum, gift shops, and foods to purchase. They gave as a gift some homemade desserts! At the final end, we were offered a free meal to eat. This was an amazing visit to learn and understand another's culture and religion. I felt very content when I left. Was extremely grateful for the guide I had. I recommend all open minded people to try learning different cultures and faiths and you can at this very beautiful ISKCON Temple! üôè"

44,Authorities are not so friendly ,"Many many people for the Hare Krishna temple. Must follow the path which does not give time to appreciate the site as you are push by the crowd, and suddenly shops where you have much more time to spend....but not really the goal to visit the temple.Interesting to see but too much commercial.

46,Nothing Great,First of all the temple is located at a good location right near Orion mall.. so it does attracts people.The only bad thing is the long distance steps .. old people walking through many steps ups and downs us not a happy part..they should make sooner arrangements for people who can not talk more in the steps due to thier issues.other wise the hall painted with lord in the top wall is something creative with God's blessings..

There is a dress code for women as in Western dresses are not allowed and something with dupatta is preferred. So keep in mind about the dress code.There is a small Pooja that can be offered which is chargeable but it is really nice and allows you to sit in front of the main temple. Pandits do the flower Abhishek on god along with chanting.While walking toward the main temple one needs to walk 108 step and chant the mantra... which is an experience in itself.There are lot of shops in the temple premises at the exit which is just like mall and offers a huge variety of food items and also for shopping.Overall it's a beautiful temple which offers lot of peace and happiness.

152,Guru Datta temple Ganagapur visit,"It is nice place to go once, or if you want to sit in quite place..go on weekdays before 12pm. If you like to eat healthy food, better you take your food with you. Otherwise lots of options for fried snacks and sweets"
153,ISKON,"Our First visit to Isckon, Bangalore has left us with extreme calmness in mind and made us feel pious. The entire place was very clean and vibrant. Display of Krishna souvenir and prasada attracted everyone. It's definitely a must visit place at Bangalore."
154,Hare Krishna,"Visited the very popular ISKCON temple on a weekday afternoon. The place is very well maintained, and wasn't that crowded. The access was very easy and there were a large variety of eatables and prasadam also available. To escape the city traffic, it's highly recommended to use the metro rail to reach this Krishna temple."
155,Beautifully constructed temple ,I visited with my mom . The place is nice but it can be better. I loved the bhajans but the separate session when you pay extra is really bias in terms of a holy  place . Prashad is good but they can put up effort to give more varieties as per the money the organisation gets‚Ä¶
156,"Hare Krishna,Hare Rama ","Strange place. I was looking for a spiritual place, this is a gaudy, loud, noisy eatery. Food and shopping. People are on cell phones all the time. It's not a temple, more a commercial enterprise. dont bother visitng unless you like starch, sugar and oil."
157,ISKCON Bangalore,A visit to ISKCON Temple in Bengaluru is a must for any traveler. The entire campus is very well planned. There are several temples within the campus with the main temple at the top. One can appreciate the beautiful architecture and get positive vibes when visiting the same. 
158,Divine place,"ISKCON is one of the most beautiful temples in India and can get really crowded at time, especially during festivals.

160,Mesmerizing,"ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) is not a traditional temple like others. It is mostly for tourists (international especially) who would like to see a temple. The temple is clean and there are 2 small temples before you reach to main one. There is special entrance as well with some fees. Normal entry there are 2 ways, one is direct to temple and another one has 108 stone slabs where you chant ""Hare Krshna"" mantra 108 times and then enter. Pros:Its very clean and neat. Well Organized.Cons: After you cross temple premises, it looks like shopping Mall. Trying to sell stuff in the name of Krishna."
161,Grand temple,"ISKCON is not only temple for worship, it is a repository of Hindu culture and a social action oriented organisation that serves around 30,000,00 poor students of Karnataka/ other states a nutritious midday meal in their Akshaya Paathra Scheme. The temple is beautifully located on a hillock in central Bangalore and receives millions of devotees who have a wonderful darshan of the Lord and receive refreshments as prasadam."

164,Beautiful temple,"A very Nice place to visit.The temple is r√©cent, but it is richly decorated. The statues are very beautiful. Also, a great place to shop indian items and to eat street food even when you are a European. I recommend visiting this place when you are in Bangalore."
165,Good,"Like other ISKON, this is also a beautiful one. They also sell some good food stuff at a very reasonable price but their (ISKON) khichdi prasaad is something out of the world. It's very sad to see that some people used to waste that as well by throwing it on the path. If you do‚Ä¶"
166,Amazing!!! ,"The temple complex is quite big and takes a while to cover all the ground. Though it's beautifully made it's a little risky during the rains as most of the time you are in the queue, you are exposed to the sky and the floor becomes quite slippery. Also, at the entrance we were‚Ä¶"
167,GREAT PLACE,"Have been there multiple times and the place is good attraction for Tourist. Right outside the metro station, the place is easily accessible. Can take a few hours to complete the darshan   "
168,Rushed though good vibes at temple ,"One of the most beautiful modern temples that I have seen. The deities are beautifully decorated and darshan is not hurried. While some may not like the commercial aspect encountered after darshan, such a large facility does require money to manage!"
169,Divine and peaceful place,"However this place is little commercialised but anyways they have maintained it superbly, ambience is filled with mesmerising smell, bhajan kirthan sound will make you feel divine. please check the timing before you go else your long journey will become futile."
170,Hare Krishna,"Its more of a tourist place than a temple, you can go there once to see the majestic structure, do some shopping, have a free prasada, other than that its not like other old temples(atleast for me)"
171,Systematic!,"I visit this temple at least once every year, sometimes more. This is  one of the most beautiful temples and it gives the feeling that GOD actually resides in there. The sevas that happen especially at night just before closing, where they are singing bhajans and putting God to sleep is one of the best experiences in an Indian temple ever. So much joy, peace, tranquility and a place where really GOD is celebrated and cherished."
172,Devotional place with amazing construction,Its a beautiful and amazing place offers a different vibration all together. Be there for a while and don't speak a word and you can feel astonishing peace. It might take you to cry even. This feeling can not be described in words.
173,Interesting visit ,"This was a truly holistic experience. I recommend buying the VIP ticket for 500 rupees. Once passes the ticket hall, you will have to rent a bag to place your shoes into (2 rupees per person). Be ready to walk through the temple bare feet having washed hands and feet. Handover‚Ä¶"
174,Rejuvenate,I have been going here from last 3 to 4 years. I enjoy the view of Bangalore from every time and also get to meditate and spend some time in solitude with fresh and cold breeze.

177,Nice,"Come here to spend about 2 hours. You get to see this immense building of temple built on a small hill near Mahalakshmi Layout. The nearest metro station is Mahalakshmi Layout and Sandal soap factory metro is also next close one. The temple provides normal entry for free as well as special entry for Rs.300 for a family  which comes along with 4 laddu as Prasad and a book worth Rs.70. The route for special Darshan is shortened.The Darshan means the view of Lord Krishna is just simply fascinating. Lord Krishna is seen with Radha, also seen with Balrama.It takes about 25 minutes on a weekday to reach Lord Krishna's idol from the start.After the Darshan there are stalls to buy books, clothes, toys and others that are related to Iskcon and Hare Krishna Hare Ram. Also there are stalls to have variety of good food, snacks and sweets.Free prashad is provided to all visitors during the exit.There is also a restaurant located at the base when you exit the top building where you can have meals on table."

If you are religiously or culturally inclined you will find you could spend a lot of time here. Ample parking. The architecture is lovely. Very well run, in an orderly manner, there are three floors that house various deities with elevators that connect the different floors.. Lord Krishna here is beautifully decorated by devout followers. The whole ambience is reverent with the chant of Lord Krishna. We were lucky to have visited on Datta Jayanthi. The decor on that day was indescribably beautiful where the main color was all shades of blue and gold interlaced with peacock feathers. A blessed sight that is unforgettable! ISKCON houses many banquet halls where you can hold private events with prior booking. With various in house  restaurants, the food is the best part! Awesome does not describe it! There is even a store that sells all things Krishna to take with you as souvenirs. Go for the temple. Go for the architecture. Go for the food. And don't forget to say Radhe Radhe."
204,nice place to visit,"temple is really nice , architecture is amazing , love the gold thing inside the temple. but one thing makes me wonder is if we want to do any pooja you have to pay for that which is not good . we also believe in god we also go to temple at north india but we doesn't pay for any pooja. its upto us how much we want to give a donation from our heart . this thing should be changed. other than that everything was good"
205,Temple at a glance,"Conveniently located opposite to Metro station Mahalaxmi, it is a must visit spot for all. Located at a hill top it surely gives a great view from below. The property is well managed and proper system is followed for all devotees to take blessings."
206,Visit with my colleagues,"A temple visit has different meanings for different people. For the devout, it is a pure and simple opportunity to relate to an idol and a beautiful divine experience.

212,Commercial feeling,"soul searching place to visit, to cleanse yourself. family visit with plenty to see and history to take time to enjoy,"
213,ISKON,You will get all the peace you want here. Its near to railway station so can be covered on the way if travelling by train.

234,Peaceful and Lovely place,"loved the experience and the Dharshan, its exceptional, the ambience, the chanting , the devotion..."
235,My family's fav place,"We had to travel an hour to reach the temple as we were on the other side of Bengaluru, but the temple is beautifully built. Women need to wear skirts and men the local dhoti. Incase you dont have one its available for rent at the location. Try and avoid peak morning and evening hours."
236,Worth Visiting land mark.,Good place.we will come to next.but need to clen and tidy more.to less of public transpost.all the karnatka people behaviour is pathetic.they dont respect national language.
237,Load Krishna,"In my review earlier slight correction. ‚ÄúLady‚Äôs‚Äù should read as LADDU  The auto fill in was the culprit  Have been to this temple since their opening about 8-9, years ago. I especially like the laddus from Tirupathi Balaji  Temple."

240,Peaceful place in Bangalore,"It was some time since I walked streets barefoot :) But that‚Äôs how you get inside the temple, no other option. And also no shortcuts on the grounds to get into the temple - you are guided by wards and signs through the yard left and right, up and down, but not straightforward.‚Ä¶"
241,Iskcon is a temple of Krishna,Visited the temple to understand more of the Hindu cultural. Very interesting place. At the end of the tour the monk was to overwhelming in trying to teach you the basics and purchase items from the store. Overall a good experience
242,Calm your soul!!,"Place is really beautiful made with all of articulation and sculpture made on wall temples. Inside the temple, there are many stalls of cloths, sweets,fast food items which were unnecessary. Temple itself was huge and build properly. Must visit one time"
243,Beautiful Temple of Lord Krishna,"Not like most of the other Iscon temples, this is different. One can experience the difference by just being in the premises. "
244,A money pit,Kept getting yelled at for not knowing what to do or go. Thought the Krishnas were calm. Give it a miss. 
245,A Beautiful place to visit,Had a bad experience and got shouted at by the fellow just because i moved in a queue without chanting hare ram. Krishna represents pure love but i dint find that they believe in what they are preaching. Very bad experience and has left a bad impression. I wont be considering going there again.
246,Sunday visit,"Expect to get jostled, ushered and shoved but all in the spirit of this being India and a sacred site to visit that is very popular. There is a shoe drop-off point nearby the entrance where you have to leave your shoes. You can pay the access fee to the temple by card or cash - if you don't have change for shoe storage, the kind people at the entry might provide you a coin. There's a guided route through the temple and I was occasionally direct a different way by guards and temple employees to avoid the fray and get a quicker walk through - which was great. Parts of this temple are very modern and watching the Hare Krishna sing, dance and pray makes you realise why this is a popular religion. A great experience in Bangalore/Bengaluru!"
247,Peaceful Visit Saying the MahaMantra,Must visit to get peace of mind . Far from the city but worth the visit. Accessible by metro. Do attend the main aarti it's spectacular
248,ONE OF THE BEST TEMPLE IN BANGLORE,"Yes. U visited this temple a while ago. It's at a height and is usually crowded. If you've problem with sitting in lines/ or any health problem like suffocation due to crowds; Don't visit.  While in the other hand, evening is the best time to visit this temple üòå it's a holy‚Ä¶"
249,Connect the physical world to the spiritual world,"What a great experience. We have been here 4 or 5 times. It's a beautiful compound and the people are super nice. It's clean and a great way to see a temple. I world recommend to find out if it's a special day or not because it can get really crowded. Also, no shorts for men or women and you walk it all without shoes"
250,Feels like God's own place,Properly maintained. Peaceful. Reaching there was bit difficult as we are starting too far from the temple.   
251,Good place,Visited with my father. Very peaceful and satisfying. My dad enjoyed a lot and we had food also there.
252,Huge and Beautiful temple complex,"The crowd management is really good, with systematic bars for queues. You need to be dressed well to be allowed inside. If you are wearing shorts they will provide a lungi for guys and for girls a saree to drape, a security deposit needs to be paid. We need to submit our backpacks and footwear at the counter, coupons provided. The structure is beautiful and the place is calm and peaceful."
253,Great Paintings,I had been to ISKON  temple years ago . This was my second visit . The darshan was wonderful . What disturbed me was the commercialism which has developed. All the exits go through the shopping booths and you have to pass through the food court . Hundred percent chances of‚Ä¶
254,Excellent Monumental Architecture.,The best part of a visit to ISKON is being part of the Aarti which they perform in the evenings and mornings. I have found the atmosphere in the evening one's to be better. There is something undesirable about it : I guess it's the combined Bhakti / belief of people which help‚Ä¶
255,Interesting but disturbing ,First time at a temple and this did not disappoint.  Architecture was interesting and got to watch the closing prayers at about 12:40.  I was uncomfortable going barefoot but the floors were clean.  Don‚Äôt be surprised with the commercialism under the temple on the way out
256,God Place,"Iscon temple stands in a majestic grandeur. As you step in the chanting takes you into a calming mood. Even if you are not religious, walking through the temple premises is worth. Temple premises is kept clean and orderly. Finally there are great food counters awaiting you to‚Ä¶"
257,A Must Visit ,The cleanliness and sumptuous food merits all praise.    The systematic spiritual rituals adds to the authentic worship.    The courtesy prasadam is simple but cooked well.    Nice place to visit with kids and family.    the early morning aarathi is a visual treat.
258,"Tourist Temple, not a traditional one",It was my second visit to iskon. I just do not want to miss iskon whenever i come to banglore. Lovely temple. Well managed. 
259,Lord Krishna temple,Love the temple. mesmerizing structure. prasad was too yummy. silent and energizing. too large. it take 40 minutes to fully cover the temple. no one ask for daksina.
260,An Evening out for Divine Experience ,No where will you find such a peace and just by looking at the idol you would be mesmerized.  adding to that the place is very well maintained and super clean with directions and help all around.
261,Warning unless you are really into Hare Hare,I always visit the ISKON whenever I get frustrated or when I will be in Happy mood . One of the best place in Bangalore . must visit place.
262,Great expereince!,we visited temple in the evening. Entry for general public is thru separate gate. If you want to have priority darshan you can buy ticket for the same else go in normal line. Photography inside temple is strictly prohibited. you can buy food and snacks from temple premises at exorbitant price.temple is slowly being crowded by the upcoming high rises buildings nearby
263,Divine!!,"Very organized and systematic in making sure there is no conjunction on the crowd. Clean and very pleasant. Well maintained, friendly care takers and very welcoming community. Majestic look and royal feeling as you enter in."
264,Positive Energy,Good temple to visit if you stay near by and you will require atleast 2-3 hours to roam around and see the beautiful temple
265,"Spectacular Temple, Mesmerizing Prayer Services","The temple is a very nice experience, as others have described.  My suggestion is to take the expedited lane, which for 300 rupees, allows you to ""cut"" the main line.  In addition to that (potentially significant) advantage, you are given a special chanting experience, discounts on temple literature and a box of 2 take home sweets.  Well worth it."
266,Lord Krishna is always with you ,"This is the place you will love to visit with your family. You will feel strong positive aura once you enter the main temple. Temple is very well managed and clean. It has ample space for 2 and 4 wheeler parking. Don't miss to taste the food, coconut sweets and snacks. You will‚Ä¶"
267,Completely commercialised ,Nice place. Serene. A bit of a cult following. You may not like the undue pressure to chant Hare Krishna. Has lunch on offer too. Tip : adults dressed in shorts may not be let in.
268,Inner Peace,A magnificent piece of architecture that is neat and surrounded by neatness unlike the one in brindhaven on north.    Serene and beautiful architecture that is only impacted by the heavy traffic of bangalore
269,Peaceful place,I was in the night and had an opportunity to see the festival. amazing experience- sad that we can't do photos
270,Beautiful temple in Bangalore,It‚Äôs one of the most beautiful ISKCON temples in the country. Never very crowded and very peaceful. The Prasad is excellent 
271,Peace of mind,"Went as a tourist rather than a devotee. Certainly worth seeing, although we went on a public holiday so it was quite crowded. Most of the folks there were more interested in taking selfies rather than enjoying the divinity, but such is life these days!"
272,Nice temple.   It is very heavily consumer oriented,"I‚Äôm afraid to say it but this place of worship has been turned into a money making scheme. Once you have been through the main hall every turn leads you to another room in which they try to sell you more things.  Don‚Äôt get sucked in here, don‚Äôt buy any extra tickets, don‚Äôt get‚Ä¶"
273,What is ISKCON? ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  Read on !!,It's a mega temple...too big.. one of the biggest.. It has been very well maintained and proper managed by the staff ...  Do visit late in the evning to view the lighting. There are 108 steps to climb wherein one can sacredly chant - Hare Krishna maha-mantra for 108 times. The‚Ä¶
274,ISKON Temple Review,"We visited the Iskcon temple and it gave us the calmness and spiritual connection that we were seeking. The development of the temples over the years is testimony to the great work and influence of Sri Prabupadha, the founder of Iskcon and his legacy lives on here! Hare Krishna"
275,What beautiful idols!,"The Iskcon temple is nothing else than a tourist trap where the Krishna loyal wants to influence you. I must be honest and say I really felt bad during the visit. I was forced to get blessed and prayed for, forced to walk thru several floors like in an IKEA wear-house and‚Ä¶"
276,Interesting cultural immersion,Though I took special visit as my sister was there and being a paid visit it was easier to get closer to main god of temple. I like the place a lot and it is a good place to see
277,Religious ,"Iskon is very commercial now as I visited with family didn‚Äôt had feeling of temple, just felt like I went see mall or palace with god. Last year I took my NRI friend he thought it‚Äôs a mall."
278,ISKCON Temple Bengaluru,"I am very impressed with the ideals of ISKCON - decoding spirituality so it is understandable and palatable for the masses, spreading the word of the Bhagwad Gita in simple terms so people are inspired to live by its ideals. There is some really good work being done by ISKCON at‚Ä¶"
279,PeaceATplace`Iskcon,"What a place to be, after a hectic office day on your tour...an excellent experience ...stayed there till I felt really calm from inside!"
280,C.MAHADEVAN,I love the place. I just love the ambience and the overall experience to be there. And you get really nice food here. The desserts are awesome. It is must visit if you are in Bangalore and love tranquility. Do visit.
281,"Well organised, very peaceful","I went there for prayers; ending up being overwhelmed with the structure and magnitude of the whole set up. The prayer area is a joy, peace for the mind"
282,A touch of old traditions in a modern metropolis,ISKCON is a must see place to go. It is stunningly beautiful and clean. The ambience is reverent.... Until you are herded out through multiple gift shops. Until that I absolutely would have given a 5 star. So I give 4 stars s being forced to go through a theme park like court. I realize they need to make money but I wish they would do it in a different way.  I will say the food area is nice and tasty. Go early as there are long lines.
283,ISKCON the place to be if you want  exclusive darshan of Krishna in a busy City.,"It's a huge temple.  You have to leave your shoes in the parking lot.  As a visitor, I didn't know how meaningful that would be.  After walking from the lot to the temple, you are now on a one-way trip.  After observing the service, which we had very little choice in other than to make a scene, we were ushered out a different way than we came in.  You either make a scene or you walk through their incredibly long gift shop and food stall track that dumped us out of the temple just about as far away from our shoes as could be - with no real idea where we were.  We then wandered around for way too long looking for our shoes and our ride.  Very skippable."
284,Nice temple,"I have been Many times to Iskcon Temple, its the best of best which i have seen, to go there u can catch many transport facilities, it's a white Building Beautifully made, I think I have seen few More Iskcon with same style of set. To go inside the temple feels Peace n calm,‚Ä¶"
285,"Ok, nothing special ",Good experience... Especially in the evenings...serene atmosphere...lovely ambience.. Overall a lovely experience
286,crowded nice but basically a market not a religious place,"Over-hyped temple. May be a special place for ISKON members, but not the same for the others. Complicated way up and down the hill to exhaust you. Wastage of time. No peace, no serenity. Hyderabad ISKON though smaller is a much better place."
287,Holy place ,It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. The temple is a huge cultural complex that was inaugurated in 1997 by Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma. There is free distribution of Sri Krishna prasadam to all visitors during the darshana hours.There is a gold-plated‚Ä¶
288,Iskcon temple,"A large structure soon to be outdone by an even bigger version on the outskirts of Bengaluru. The purpose of the temple however confuses me, is it a place of worship or a means of extracting money from people. The automatic  donation accepting ATM type machines, the crowd control barriers and the precious metal and jewelled covered statues all speak of wealth whilst outside on the streets beggars ask for money. I fully accept it does good works in feeding thousands of school children but the building and atmosphere perturbed me. Overall it is quite interesting but I came away confused and vaguely disturbed. Visit if you must."
289,Divine experience,OK If you‚Äôre bored on the weekend and have nothing better to do. Can‚Äôt compete with the temples in and around New Delhi.
290,"Beautiful temple, amazing experience","We made the big donation amount to be able to use the VIP lines and STILL wound up having to go get cash from our driver (as we only had cards and paid a generous donation via card to visit) so that the ""shoe person"" could get his 3 rupees per pair of shoes.   It's one of the‚Ä¶"
291,Iskcon the real temple,"ISKCON Bangalore is arguably the best built structure and stands out both in terms of the size and grandeour. The temple, built over 30 years ago houses Shri Narasimha, Shri Balaji and Shri Radha-Krishna in separate sanctums. The visitor is guided through a carefully laid out path in such a way  one gets to have darshan in peace. Even during the Bramhotsava time, the crowd was effectively managed, which is commendable. The prasada counters sell a variety of food / sweets which is tasty and good. Toilets are available and parking is adequate too. Wheelchair borne devotees can use the earmarked entrace to enter and exit the temple, which is very helpful.Visit at dawn or dusk for a better experience. The evening arti is wonderful.. Being a temple, devotees are advised to dress modestly. Shorts, night dresses etc. are not allowed inside. ISKCON could be reached via Rajaji nagar by road or via Metro (Mahalakshmi Metro is 400m ahead)."
292,""" Best Iskcon temple in India""","My favourite place to feel the presence of energy that energises you at the start of the day and calms you down at the end of the day...The best place to visit the Temple is for the Darshan Aarti at 7:30 am or the Shayana Aarti at 8:00 pm. I like the Shayana Aarti more...Placed on a hill top, the vast temple area has abundant light and air... The evening wind breeze while the devotees sing bhajans in a soothing lighting invokes a beautiful feeling within me that I cant describe...Everyone should definitely experience it once..."
293,A Must visit to the Temple,"You do not need to make a donation to enter the temple, however if you do you get a VIP ticket which saves you from standing many of the long lines. What I wish I knew before the time:- No camera's are allowed in, rather leave your camera at the hotel (you can take your cellphone in and there are a few places you are allowed to take pictures).- No shoes or socks allowed, they do have a place at the entrance where you can leave your shoes for a very small fee, take cash for this.I am glad we went and overall all it was an interesting experience. Would recommend."
294,"Very Quite, good if you are going alone or for meditation. Food - fried or sweet",As usual Iskcon always gives the best experience. This time it was more awesome. The entry it self amazing. Poojari asked us chant and go through a spl queue so that we complete Hare Rama Hare Krishna mantra 108 times by the time we complete the special queue for this chanting.‚Ä¶
295,It Took 120 Steps To The Entrance,We had been to the ISCON temple in the evening. There was not much of a rush. But still visitors in reasonable number were there. There was queue. Everyone was obeying rules. The line moved fast. We had darshan comfortably. We bought prasad. There was free distribution of prasad too.
296,Iskon temple Bangalore,Didn't like this one little bit. Seemed to me to be more like a theme park than a temple. All about money making and very little about spiritual wellbeing sadly.
297,Too much commercial,The first problem was our entry with my dslr camera which they didn't allow. It was unfortunately a festival day so we faced a huge queue. The temple complex seems more of a market place than a religious one. They did give some sweet prasad while we came to exit.
298,Interesting place,"I am an ISKCON life member and have visited ISKCON temples all over the world, and generally liked them I have also stayed at some of the facilities. However, ISKCON Bangalore was a blatant show of commercialism - they asked for money at every stage, tried to force me to buy‚Ä¶"
299,Magnificient temple,"On the one hand it was very interesting to see it and get a little familiar with the religion. However let's be honest here: it is not very traditional and very touristy. When you pay te premium fee, you will be treated better. This is not where the locals go. But still it was very nice to see it."
