0,Very impressive,"Because of a big construction, we had to take the backside entrance which was a bit hidden. The museum is nicely built with many beautiful mosaics. We were both astonished and overwhelmed by the quality and quantity of the exhibition. We loved it but also would prefer more of these items at their original place."
1,Do not miss it,"This is a very new museum so it is modern from the outside in. It is dark inside, for obvious reasons of preserving the mosaics as much as possible. The mosaics kept here were largely found in the Zeugma area and is predominantly Greek. Most of the mosaics are very well in tact and the museum has very good signage going. There are electronic interactive displays in various parts of the museum too. The basement level was under construction when I visited so I didn't get to see much down there but the mosaics on the entrance level was definitely worth the visit. It becomes a  bit noisy with larger crowds because it creates a hollow sound. When you have a midday flight out of Gaziantep, you can easily visit this museum and make it for your flight. Don't skip this, it is worth it!"
2,Superb,"This is not a big museum and some parts were closed but the mosaics are incredible, very artistic. It is definitely worth the visit!"
3,An amazing experience,"A very attracting museum makes you admire mosaic art.The building is very modern and inside also decorated appropriate with the history.There are lots of board inside the museum describing which art means what but I definitely suggest audiophones which was very helpful, clear and provides lots of details about the art pieces including digging times of them."
4,where the gypsy girl is,"You can spend 2-3 hours inside. They have a nice collection, also in the neighborhood of this museum there is a famous kebap restaurant (halil), where you can complete your trip."
5,Wow,Impressive museum with great mosaics. A nice building which is operated nicely. Staff is helpful and it is very close to city center.
6,Nice and cheap,"I was there in July, together with new Antakya museum, this is the one of the must see even in Turkey scope.Very tourist friendly ambient, strongly recommended."
7,Magnificient Zeugma,"Took us 3 hour to leave. it was hard to leave. buy ipod museum info things, very good explanations there."
8,The best Mosaic museum I have  visited,"When I was outside the museum I was very surprised from the structure, I was not suspecting to find such a big and nice museum.It was very well organized and the mosaics inside were marvellous."
9,Sumptuous mosaics from Roman Villas.,"This is a great place to do something cultural in Antep, very interesting, the only con is that is not close to city centre, so you need a cab or a bus to get there, but it is definetly worth it."
10,Outstanding,I visited Bardo Museum in Tunus couple years ago. It is known as the best mosaic museum on the world. Let me say that  Gaziantep Zeugma Mosaic Museum is as good as Bardo. Do not forget to watch the movie of history of Zeugma Ancient city at the entrance of the museum before starting to visit inside.
11,Wonderful,This is biggest mosaic museum. Amazing place that you must see. Many lovely mosaic of gods from myths.
12,Presentation  Presentation. Presentation,zeugma museum was second best after the museum in Tunisia couple of years ago. I was astonished to see such an improvement in couple of  years. Ä±f you are interested like we are I strongly recommend you to see that. they  have got a new museum building which I could say the best I have ever seen to exhibit the the most precious and historical articles. one does ask himself the question where have those people who made this fascinating pieces have gone. the people and the city does not reflect the excellence of those art pieces. the same question you ask yourself in Egypt and Tunisia. now I can say the best mosaic museum is Zeugma.
13,Just for this museum,"The museum is a huge modern building on a main road, fairly central to everything. It's free with a Museum Pass, and it is completely worth seeing the mosaics from the 2nd and 3rd centuries. You won't believe the brilliance and the precision of thee works of art. The two shops are lovely and filled with artifacts as well as ball caps and teas."
14,Wonderful museum,We had so short time in Antep but our fav thing is Zeugma Museum. Take your 2 hours enough to see around this museum. But we had less than 40 minutes and fascinating Gipsy Girl masterpiece that you will find a special show area. You will not find any sign . Upper floor and ask Cingene Kizi to the security .
15,Great Mosaics,"I have visited the museum on Saturday, morning time. It was not so crowded and i could take lots of photos( wo flash ). By the help of the audio tour you can listen to the details of all the mosaics with stories from Greek mythology. Many of the mosaics from the villas have been saved before the area was flooded by the dam. Please save at least 2 hours of your day to see the ancient brilliance of Romans, if you ever visit Gaziantep, the city of food. The museum is both disabled and child friendly. Entry is 15TL (5 euros )."
16,"A Must for Lovers of Heritage, Art and Design","I was in Zeugma Mosaic Museum in Antep and it was really enjoyable not only for the quantity and the quality of the mosaics in there, but even for the way in which they are presented. There are interactive installations expecially for kids. Most of all it is growing museum, with some space still empty and ready to welcome new mosaic coming from this archeological area. The only flaw was that at the ticket office didn't want to make the ""MuzeKart"" even if I showed them my resident permit and I had to pay the regular ticket (10 TL). ""MuzeKart"" allows you to enter most of the national museums in Turkey (not only in Gaziantep) and with a little money (40/50 TL) you can visit almot the beauties of the country!"
17,This is a phenomenally rich experience,Museum has two seperate buildings which are connected to each other with a bridge. First building is more attractive than the second one in my opinion. Many of the mosaics had been restored very well. Some of them are so colorful and some others are very big in size. Children may also have good time here. Information about mosaics are well prepared that children can read and follow them easily.
18,What an experience,"Zeugma Mozaik Museum let you see the magnificent ancient civilization mosaics. Beside being the biggest museum, it also has collections of the best and very old mosaic you will ever see."
19,"Excellent museum, stunning displays","A new museum ,very big but very good planned. Many  historical mosaics,most of them are master of art. A ""must see""."
20,Spectacular view of roman history in Turkey,"This museum has only been established for a few years and is located away from the city centre. It holds a remarkable collection of mosaics from the Roman city of Zeugma on the Euphrates, salvaged before the site was flooded by a new dam. The mosaics are laid out in a exemplary way and there is a very good video describing the history of the city.."
21,Great mosaics,"Went there with friends. The place is immense and full of archaeological treasures from the region, all well preserved and nicely exposed for the public. Some of the mosaics are really detailed, priceless pieces of art."
22,Incredible mosaics,"This museum is really well done, you can actually imagine the structure of the old town of Zeugma thanks to the space distribution. Mosaics are splendid, extremely well preserve.The audioguide is a very good complement, recommendable to get.If you are around do not miss it!"
23,Not to be missed,"The museum is situated just behind main railway station so it is easy to reach it by walking from the city center. It is a big, quite new building. Entrance ticket is 15 Turkish lira and is very cheap for what you can see in the museum. Besides the famous mosaic of the Gypsy Girl, there are dozens of other quite big and smaller mosaics from the ancient town of Zeugma. This is definitely not to be missed when in Gaziantep."
24,A highlight of Turkey ,"There are museums and then there's Zeugma Mosaic Museum. The museography is fantastic. The information is well delivered, well organized and clear even for non museum or antique art enthusiasts. A must for every visitor to Gaziantep or even those visiting eastern Turkey."
25,Magnificent,"Impressive, art and history museum.  Located in Antep, but 3D vine vision must be re arranged, because 3D glasses are not hygienic, they must switch with single use 3D glasses."
26,Great museum,The most beaituful and huge ancient mosaics have to be seen. In cafe-shop there are very nice gifts to buy.
27,Awesome Mosaics,Excellent Museum. I went there 2 times. But I can go there again. You can go there 20 min to walk from city center.
28,Wonderful Mosaics!,"Great exhibition of Zeugma Mosaics (there are mosaics from another places too, but the main collection is from Zeugma). The mosaics are incredibly in good condition and It's worth a long visit. Take the audio guide. There's also a short film about the mosaics but you have to pay and it's not open to everyone. I think they could find the way to show the film all day in different languages as it happens in most museums."
29,Never in my life. . .,A must see place for ever person who is interested in arts and civilization history. Very nice architecture and nicely curated valuable content.
30,Impressive ,"If u r in Turkey, this is one of the museum that you should not leave from the country without seeing it. Otherwise you will miss the world biggest mosaic museum.When you enter it you can feel that you are walking in a street which belongs to B.C. 300 while gods, goddess are sharing their company with you. The star of the show is Gypsy Girl where she has her own room . You cant catch your eyes from her eyes while u connected ;)"
31,Fantastic Journey ,it was the one of best museum Ä± visited in turkey. its free for museum card members. you should visit if you travel to gaziantep
32,Very nice,We have also visited Belkis region to see the archaeologist. There are many mosaics found there. Some are displayed in this museum. But there are many others on the Belkis area near the river Firat.
33,Wow,"The mosaic are soooo beautifull!It Will take you 1,5 hour to see the museum (can also be quicker). The (love) stories with the mosaics are really nice to read."
34,Best Mosaic Museum,The museum is well organized with a very interesting heritage in it. I recommend visiting this while in Gaziantep.
35,Great museum,"This is a wonderful small museum of Zeugma mosaics. The mosaics are beautiful. It is a quiet and calm place where you can enjoy the antique beauties. Marvelous pieces of mosaics that you can not find anywhere else in Turkey, even in Antakya mosaic museum. It is a must. The only scculptre in the museum is the bronze statue of Hermes which is a masterpiece."
36,Wow,One of the best display of Roman era mosaics!! Some of the mosaics are in a very good shape and itâs mind boggling to see the intricate patterns and artistic excellence of their makers. A must to see if you visit this part of Turkey
37,Worth a visit,"Beautiful museum. Entrance is 8TL. Easy to find although taking a taxi is just easier and there are taxis waiting outside. I would suggest at least 2 hours to walk around and appreciate the art works, you can hire the headphones for extra info. The gypsy girl is amazing take time there to appreciate it. Wheelchair and park accessible . Some staff speak basic English"
38,Interesting mosaixs,"Zeugma Mosaic Museum is the biggest mosaic museum in the world, It's famous and beautiful. Must be visited in Gaziantep..."
39,A must see in Antep,"A huge mozaik collection of the antique city Zeugma, and all of this in a great building with wonderful displays. Maybe the most astonishing is the so-called 'gipsy girl' image, but there is so much to see (sculpture of Mars) that this museum is truly a gem of the city. Take your time and enjoy!"
40,One of a Kind,I loved this museum. The mosaics are very well preserved. The atmosphere it'unique and i found very atractive the idea of that puzzle games for children.
41,Best of the best,"the museum is mosaic museum diffrent then many,has lots of artwork unbeliavable, Ä± felt and think diffrent as Ä± saw them,"
42,The must see in Antep,"The museum is a must see place if you like Roman mosaics.  The mosaic is used like the ""pixels"" of today's screens.  The detail they achieved with these small cut stones is amazing"
43,A must. ,"We were very lucky to have a local guide to take us travel Goreme to the east part of Turkey including Gaziantep.  We had beautiful memories from this museum and the region.  The collection - ""Gypsy girl"" really touched me."
44,Must See,This museum was the last stop on our south east Turkey tour As always our guide was very good explaining  the meaning of the  beautiful  mosaicsIf you ever come to Gaziantep please do not forget to visit this museum.
45,Highlight of my stay in Gaziantep,This museum was entitled as the biggest mosaic museum in the world. It was decorated as if it was really ancient times. Mosaics were impressive. The design was perfect. You should prefer a guided tour. #KanGurular
46,A MUST SEE place in Gaziantep,Second time at this museum. It touches me to see all the art from 2nd century. You see the well kept remains of mosaics from the ancient civilisations. The presentation is simple but very well. You pay only 4 usd for such a beautiful experience.
47,Unbelievable ,"It must be visited, no excuses. There are really good mosaic artifacts. It is a big and modern museum. Also has a souvenior shop, I also suggest visiting there; they have good souveniours, especially mosaic puzzles."
48,A Must See Place,Breathtaking details in historical mosaic floor paintings. 3D cinevision in the entrance is very educational about the history of old city Zeugma.
49,A must in Gaziantep,"This is an amazing museum filled with gigantic and smaller sized mosaics.It is amazing these pieces survived given that treasure hunters destroyed them, art collectors swindled them and the construction of dams submerged them.What has been salvaged is truly breathtaking. The beauty and detail of the art is something not to be missed. They even made some mosaics so when they had water on them it gave the appearance that the picture was moving - incredible!Get an audio guide - its only 10 tl and it gives a rich history to what you are viewing. The gypsy girl is really interesting - her eyes really do follow you wherever in the room you go - and to think that incredible detail is just a tiny part of one gigantic mosaic. If you are anywhere near Gaziantep make your way to this museum. Gaziantep is a fascinating city filled with friendly people."
50,On top of the list...,The museum purposely built to showcase the mosaics is a well planned place to visit. Modern architecture houses ancient artworks. The lighting enhances the mosaics. Extremely visitor and tourist friendly. The mosaics were amazing and worth an extended visit
51,Must Visit this Gem,The museum has a large scale of mosaics from different eras of time and they are exhibited in a very modernly decorated building. The exhibition way of mosaics are so good. This is a must do in Gaziantep.
52,Must visit,The museum is located 3km away from the city Center where you can reach with taxi easily. The historical mosaics are taking you back in time which are found not so long time ago. The missing mosaics are making you upset of course but this will be a nice time for the visitors especially when  they take the voice guidance. I suggest to take the voice guidance as there is no need for a tour guide.A place worth to visit without kids.
53,Everybody has to go,"One of the best museums I visited in Turkey. It has a reach content, cafetaria, bookstore, clean bathrooms. It is designed very nicely, you can walk through large historical mosaic art work while you listen through device and later on you can go to upper floor and view the same from a distant which gives you a better understanding of the work. It is very unique and must see place."
54,Mosaic of that lady is amazing!,"It is worth travelling many hours just to see this museum. I hope authorities bring more mosaics here, because, technically it is open to expansion. Mosaics teach us mithology, history, animals and plants of the past times and most of all grandiose life styles of those who made and enjoyed them."
55,A must see collection ,Im very satisfied about see there. I wish they have more advertisement about museum. Ticket fee is 24 turkish liras. Its very cheap and they have a film also. You have to watch it!
56,"great museum, glad these treasures were saved","The Zeugma Mosaic Museum is extremely modern and well run. Being drop off at the end of our tour, we came with suitcases. There was an storage area at the right of the entrance free of charge.The museum uses full scale replicas of street, fountain, building walls and foundation stones, constructed according to the architecture of the time. There were a ever changing video images on a small area of the floor near the entrance, that we've never seen anywhere else before. The mysterious Gypsy Girl on the second floor, displayed in a labyrinthine dark room. Very captivating.Gaziantep is so far out of the main tourist drag, the museum was not at all crowed. One can take your time to enjoy all the gorgeously displayed artwork. The 8 minutes 3D movie/video with sound track, on the right of the entrance is an experience not to be missed ( ticket 8 lira)There's a good size gift shop and cafÃ© just outside the main gate. Taxi stand is at the back of the museum. A must see if you love art and history."
57,Amazing,"Huge collection of mosaic, showing the great civilization and history . Amazing place to visit, or I would say: A must when you are in Gaziantep. I would go again and again"
58,Zeugma Mosaic Museum,"The museum has a 10 min 3D movie summarizing the history of Zeugma. It is a good idea to watch the movie before your tour. 5TL (2usd) fee is extra. During the tour you can see many floor mosaics of Zeugma, statue of Mars and ""Cingene Kizi""."
59,Must visit!,It took me 2 hours to see all the mosaics. I really enjoyed listenning the story of every mosaic from the headphone.
60,very impressive,"I did not expect to see such an enormous number of paintings of large mosaic,the museum is a masterpiece among all other mosaic museum around the world."
61,Perfect,Mosaics and exhibition are amazingly beautiful. It is better first to watch a 5 minutes video to have an idea about the history of the region after the entrance.
62,The largest mosaic museum of the world,"We didn't realise the museum was so big and seeing all the stunning mosaics, plus going by foot, made for a long day.  The best way to walk is straight up Station St, then take a left past the station and take the underpass on your right.  Once on the other side, go under the motorway, and walk along the motorway footpath to the museum."
63,Wow,A place to be seen... You will love it. It takes like 2 hours to tour whole museum if you hire and listen the records which are rented for 10 Lira.
64,A nice historical experience,"As it is the world's largest mosaic museum, everybody especially the students must visit and see the samples of ancient art. Each piece was amazing and worth to visit."
65,a must-see of the Hellenistic period,"The biggest mosaic museum in the world since 2011. I have also visited Bardo museum in Tunisia, but Zeugma impressed me much more.Most of the mosaics have been found in ancient Zeugma city near to Gaziantep, from Roman times of 2.-3. century a.d. Some of the mosaics still remained in Zeugma city and research works are still continuing.The most famous art in this museum is the collection of ""Gypsy Girl"", looking to the visitors by three-quarter glance like ""Mona Lisa"".The missing parts of some mosaics can be watched by laser technology.Although the written explanations of all art objects are satisfactory, there is also possibility of having an audio guide with a reasonable price.By this occasion, after or before visiting this fantastic museum, I highly recommend to have a lunch break at the restaurant ""Mehmet Usta"" near to the museum and to taste the local specialty of ""Kushleme"", the Turkish delight of meat."
66,Zeugma,"It is nice and wonderful placeHave a lot of draw floors, if you go there don't miss to visit m32 section to see that lady's eyes, she looks that she is looking at you every side.Also the government and Gaziantap baladya give a lot of attention to this place.I advice to visit it."
67,Truly amazing works of art,I went 2 times to this museum. and it is reasonably cheap and it is clean and well-ventilated and the lighting was great. We took many pictures of awesome mosaics from BC. and next to it there is souvenir shop with rich selection. I totally advise for anyone going to Gaziantep. thanks a lot
68,Incredible display,It is a different museum of mosaics from roman times. Don' forget to watch  3D sinevision although it is Turkish. Then take a free bus tour to cities other museums.
69,Amazing Mosaics!,"The most great and powerful museum I have ever seen. The entrance, inside, historical monuments... The workers were so careful and helpful."
70,A Hidden Gem,"A beautiful collection of mosaics, mostly from Zeugma. The collection is displayed in a very nice way and there are some interactive pieces as well. Seeing the incredible artistry from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD was just mind boggling. As I kept repeating, ""This was made with ROCKS!"" Definitely worth a trip!!"
71,Don't miss it!!,Very nice museum with gorgeous mosaics. Must be seen at all costs. it was unbelievable and the best thing I did in Antep was to spare enough time to visit.
72,Best mosaic museum in the world,"Lovely museum displaying a beautiful selection of mosaics from the ancient city of Zeugma. The museum is well laid out and the stunning mosaics are in incredibly good condition. I would have liked more information on the history of Zeugma, although perhaps it was there and I missed it. There is also a nice gift shop and cafe. Worth a visit if you are in Gaziantep."
73,Must to Visit,"It has been 6 months turned back from thÄ±s museum but I've stÄ±ll remember clearly thÄ±s place. amazing mosaÄ±cs and wonderfully dÄ±sagned , I was very happy and full of knowledge about mosaÄ±cs, Ä±t was excellent museum  I have ever seen. GazÄ± antep should show thÄ±s museum to to world !!!  The best museum I have ever seen congrats !!!!"
74,Gorgeous! ,i can't believe how they preserve the ancient stones. Perfect place to visit. If you are in Antep you have to go there. Don't forget to see the Gipsy..
75,A must in Gaziantep,It is the bostanda the biggest modacÄ± Museum in the world. It must be tried by every vistor to Gaziantep.
76,Awesome,"+ plus: mosaics are interesting - museum is new and nice - bathrooms are clean - especially the mosaic of the ""Gypsy Girl"" (as she is called) was amazeballs- minus: no minus really, even the price was a fair 20 lira (like 3 euros)"
77,Must see in Gaziantep,"This purpose-built museum to house the Zeugma mosaics was opened in 2012.  It is sleek, spacious and modern.  The mosaics are room-sized - as they were the floors of rooms in very large villas and soooo beautiful.  This museum alone is a reason to go to Gazientep - although not the only reason.  We thought it was a wonderful city!"
78,Zeugma Mosaic Museum is a unique reflection of the History,"In addition to the famous mosaic ""Gipsy Girl"", you will see lots of mosaics from ancient times. Be careful enough and you might hear the story of the Gipsy Girl!"
79,What an exciting collection!,"The museum is one of its kind, and the biggest mosaic museum in the world. All the exhibits are very nicely presented and the descriptions are very helpful."
80,Essential Gaziantep attraction,"We went first to the Zeugma excavation site and then we visited the museum.This is how you should plan your trip.It was marvelous,we had a personal  guide who led us from Gaziantep to Urfa. With his background all mosaics made more sense.The ones for the bedroom,the living room or the cistern had all different  patterns. The museum is well set up ,there are audio devices in case you do not have a guide with you."
81,Amazing selection of mosaics,Fantastic museum of Zeugmaâs incredible mosaics. Better to watch the cinevision before the tour inside. Donât miss the gipsy girl upstairs
82,Simply fabulous. The visit of this museum justifies a trip to Gaziantep..,Zeugma mosaic museum offers excellent range of mosaics dated early centuries.  We were amazed how good they were built.
83,Gorgeous..,"I visited the Mozaic Museum twice (on April 14 and 15). The large size mosaics are very impressive, depicting scenes from mythological and religious stories. The colors are excellent, the explanation on the plaques and head sets very clear."
84,Excellent,"It is a very special place that I have never seen a similar place or museum ever, all of it is mosaic that you can not believe these are all from one place, each Pease tells it's own story, and the most amazing things is to know the story of the girl that you always see in Gaziantep"
85,Perfect,This is a fascinating museum made especially to house the mosaics found whilst a damp was being developed. Saving them from the waters. The C2nd to C4th Greek works depict everything from the classic god through to the early signs of Christianity. The large space really brought me close to the peoples who made the art.
86,Very impressive,"One of the best mosaic museums in the world.The layout, collection, staff and exhibits are very good. There's a 10 minute history video-show you can attend for a very reasonable price at the very beginning. The whole experience is stunning, most of the mosaics hit you hard and just leave you wondering about old times and history of those mosaics. If you're really on a budget and can't afford a audio guide, there's an app on Android market for free and it's the exact same information (we compared both when we visited the museum)."
87,Fascinating..,Very well organized display of the Greek mosaics rescued from the Rumkale reservoir. Whole floors from the villas in that area are shown - reminds me of the mosaics of Pompeii. Worth a visit!
88,Best mosaics ever ,"The Zeugma museum is the biggest mosaic museum on earth...  From the entrance to each hall and the way the mosaics are presented is beatifully planned and amazing. The effort had spent to preserve all those mosaics and to create museum like this deserves a very big appreciation. Even children enjoyed very much from the visit apart from the fascinating environment, thanks to child  friendly fields."
89,Lots of beautiful mosaics,"Working in Gaziantep in February 2019 and our host arranged for us to visit this museum.  Did not know what to expect but you start with a 3D film about the mosaics, where they were found and how they were rescued from the Euphratris river as it was being flooded as part of a large project.  We were fortunate to have a local archiologist to explain each mosaic although for visitors you can rent a headset in your own language to I assume provide the same.  The mosaics are wonderful most laid out on the floor but some wall mounted.  2 hours went past in the blink of an eye.  By the time we ame out the caf and shop had closed so cnnot comment on them.  Definately the place to visit if you are in Gaziantep"
90,Great museum,This museum is one of the best museums in Turkey. You can find great and famous mosaics which were found around. As a museum it still needs some improvements but it is a must see in Gaziantep.
91,"The floor Mosaic of the Euphrates villa, Belkis-Zeugma","With the new construction and building contributed to the city, this museum is considered to be one of the largest mosaic museums in the world. It is home to many precious and uniqeu mosaics unearthed from the Roman aged ancient site Zeugma. The richness of art and culture in Zeugma fascinate every visitor. It is a must visit , with an extension visit to the original site of Zeugma itself."
92,Great History!,What a special place to be and to feel! You can see The one and only Mars statue inside. ALso great Roman mosaics on the floor and on the walls. You can start your tour with a video show.
93,Feel Happy Dreaming About Past,"This is one of the best museums in Turkey. It displays mosaics that have been excavated from the area around Antep. In addition to the famous Gypsy Girl, there are amazing mosaics exquisitely displayed. Although the 3D video is in Turkish only, it is worth the time and small fee (5TL). This is a must-see!"

110,It needs to be seen!,"In total I do not like museums. I prefer to see some streets and squares, churches and mosques with their people and cats, to see the life in the city. But this museum is wonderful. It is really big. You can read some information about hundreds of square meters of mosaics, but it cannot help you to imagine the magnification of it. You should visit it and then you can see the life of ancient city Zeugma. The exhibition still is not full, it is in work now."
111,Amazing world class museum ,New and modern museum of Gaziantep. There are several mosaics are shown there. The Gypsy Mosaic is the one of the best piece of this museum.
112,Looking for a piece of history? Here you are!,Such a large collection of mosaic! While walking you can really dream about the residents and their lifestyle . One can go to Gaziantep just to visit this Museum. You may want to allocate approximately 90 minutes.

115,Must see,I particularly liked the mozaik and the impressive wall to wall art work. The excavation work is well explained and presented.
116,The Biggest Mozaik Museum,"This museum is located in the suburb area of Gaziantep. It's better to take a taxi to get there.And due to the location, there are few visitors and it's good to look around.Since it opens at 9, It's preferred to visit early-opening places first if you are in a hurry schedule.It's worthy of visiting and well-maintained. The highlight of the museum is The Gypsy Girl that the girl in the painting is beholding. Try to move from left to right while watching."
117,Definitely Amazing & Impressing!,"Going to this museum is an experience worth the trip to Turkey.  The quality of the mosaics is outstanding.  The mosaics are exhibited as they were found, in many cases in the settings of the villas that housed them.  The second floor looks down unto the astounding designs  so they can be better understood and appreciated. Incredible portraits, inventive patterns, carefully selected colors, all make for a visit that you promise yourself you will return again. A must see."
118,Mesmerising experience,"Beautiful museum, with an excellent and astounding collection of mosaics. Beautifully lit and the explanations next to the mosaics are both in Turkish and English, and provide interesting information. Really a worthwhile visit."
119,fantastic,This museum was built to house the beautiful mosaics from the ancient city of Zeugma. They have been excavated near Gaziantep. The mosaics are incredible!  This museum is a must to see when visiting
120,Super,"This museum is the place where you can find ancient nations art on mosaics and I am sure you will definitely become impressed with their aspects on reflecting feelings, situations with art. By the way don't forget to look deeply on eyes of the roman girl, be sure she will hold you!!!"
121,"Spectacular, A Must Seen Museum",I didn't expect it to be huge.Contains lots of amazing mosaics.You should definitely visit this one of a kind museum
122,Must go when you are in Gaziantep,"The museum building itself is modern and very welcoming, but once inside you're treated to history in the skilful form of mosaics. Some of the mosaics on show are simply stunning, huge in size and a mixture of colours and condition of the piece. The related story boards are very detailed and certainly improve the visit, which makes a nice change. If you have time when visiting Gaziantep, you should definitely visit Zeugma Mosaic Museum, it's that good."
123,Fabulous ,Loved the detail and preservation of historic items from Roman times.  It is one of the best museums I have seen in Turkey.  Very modern and peaceful.  Reasonably priced Gift shop on site.
124,Outstanding Museum,"A must!! Even if it is out of your way, you have to add this museum to your preferred sights. The recovered mosaics and frescoâs are impressive. Knowing that they had limited time to save these pieces of art. Each one is more impressive than the other ... visit :)"
125,Simply stunning,I am not a museum type person but was blown away by this museum. Incredible collection displayed beautifully. Spent 1 1/2 hours here but could easily have taken longer. Much more impressive mosaic display than at Pompeii or the Ephesus Terrace Houses. Entry covered by the Museum Card. Was very busy at time we visited. Visited at opening time and there were already 4 tour buses unloaded in the carpark.
126,Indoor history in Antep,"Exceptional and amazing , must visit in Gaziantep. So many beautiful mosaics from 2.-3. Century ..preserved well .."
127,Must have been there,"Amazing museum - certainly one of the really high spots of my whole tour of Turkey. Please don't think that this is just ""another boring museum"" - it's not. Could have spent hours there. Incredible mosaics, beautifully displayed."
128,Wonderful museum ,It is the most impressive place after Vatican city for me. Mosaics and their stories are so effective when you keep in mind that they were made in AC 3.century. The tragic thing is most of them found when it was stealing.
129,Too good to miss,"It's the largest mozaic museum in the world.I went to he 'gypsy girl' mozaic 3 times!It's really amazing.The gypsy girl mozaic is inside a dark room and I thought that he same room could be used for some of the other mozaics as well.Really amazing..It was the reason i went to Antep, and it's worth it.It's one of the things that amazed me more than i expected, even if i had seen the photo before!I recommend wathcing a documentary before going there as well."
130,Must visit the Museum if you are in Gaziantep.,i liked to looking from upside to the ground mosaic. And Zeugma was great! There were a very good stories about paints and their histories.
131,incredible museum,"Well maintained museum for a 1-2 h visit, close to forum mall. Take your time through the first parts of the museum, as here the best collections are exhibited, towards the end it becomes all less extraordinary."
132,Wonderful place,Absolutely a must to visit this museum while in the region.Stunning recovered mosaics nicely presented.
133,A must see in Gaziantep,This rivals Naples as far a mosaics and there are more here It is worth going a bit out of your way to see it
134,Must go Location For Gaziantep,"Quite the collection of beautiful mosaics in excellent condition. Small museum but well worth the visit. The ""gypsy girl"" is fantastic."
135,Avesome,Don't leave Gaziantep without seeing this museum. I amazed by the mosaics and history beyond them. You should take 2 hours for truly visiting
136,What the hell,"This is one of the most interesting and impressive places you can visit in Gaziantep. The museum exhibits amazing Ancient Greek mosaics. If you are into arts and history, you shouldnât miss this place. Tickets are not that expensive compared to museums elsewhere in Europe."
137,Zeugma Mosaic Museum,"Wow, what a place. I've been to the Urfa museum which was similarly impressive. But Zeugma is most definitely an attraction not just in Gaziantep, but I'll rate as nation-wide. Even on approach to enter this massive building you get a feeling that you'll be in for a treat. And it doesn't disappoint! There is an enormous collection of mosaics on display, some of them in outstanding condition.You can get up close to many of the displays and marvel at the meticulous work. It will leave you wondering how anyone could have produced such large pieces with such detail while sitting up close. Some of the 3D effects are like the great-grandparents of MC Escher pieces. The guards on duty were particularly helpful. I wandered amongst the displays, reading the information, with great wonderment (like ""what have we become: from this showy art for your bathroom or living room to chintzy PVC lino""), and was given a lot of additional information by the guard on duty.Will go again, given a chance."
138,Wow!,"Absolutely must do for travelers... Zeugma Mosaic Museum, in Gaziantep is the biggest mosaic museum in the world and it is reaaly impressive museum. Great museum for all ages"
139,stunning collection of mosaics,"Amazing and must see , should be on the top list of best historical event that changed the history of humanity civilization"
140,Must see,It is amazing that art was developed so much during the ancient times. All mosaics are full of fairy tales and you can get lost during your visit among your dreams. It was really a pleasure for me to visit such a lovely place.
141,Unique and a Must see,"Absolutely world class,albeit small, museum dedicated to the mosaics salvaged ahead of a huge turkish dam project. We had heard about the museum, the vastness of the mosaics (some about 30 feet across). They are housed in a well designed building with beautiful lighting and tranquility. Highly recommended if you like antiquities"
142,Amazing collection of mosaics ,"Considering how little time the archaeological team had to rescue the mosaics before the site was deliberately flooded, it is amazing the extent of the mosaics on display here."
143,Clever chaps those Greeks,"I think its one of the best museums in Turkey. Its a must while visiting Gaziantep. Very professionally chosen the lights, made up the areas and the mosaics are just beautiful!"
144,The best collection of mosaics,"Very attractive place, especially Gaziantep is a distinct attraction in the world before you die. Meals of Gaziantep are indispensable."
145,Must visit this museum when in Gaziantep,"Like everyone else we were amazed by the high standard of this Museum.  It is an absolute must see, the mosaics are beautifully displayed and the experience is uplifting. We spent much longer than we had expected to do and learnt a lot about Zeugma and the saving of these fantastic mosaics."
146,Great place,Beautifully presented art and beliefs with helpful description.  I am embarrassed to say that after days of going round many actual sites under the baking sun - this was a comfortable way to concentrate on the essence of their finest works.  An absolute must see.  The clarity of how they depicted important mythological stories is to be respected.  To think that we can stand within arms reach of these achievements...without having to perspire either.
147,must see,"This place is a must if you love art and archeology. The mosaics and especially ""the gypsy girl"" are unforgettable. There are also inter-active boards for kids to play."
148,Mosaic,"If you can ever manage to visit Southeastern Anatolia, don't miss this museum. The whole building is kept quite new and clean. You need at least one hour to visit thoroughly. Museum shop also has some nice stuff to offer!"
149,A must visit in Gaziantep,"I have seen many museums but this is definitely one of the most impressing and perfectly organized ones. Almost all mosaics are in perfect shape and well preserved, obviously with some damage of hundreds of years. Breath taking art level at that time and amazing collection. I have to congratulate museum autorithy for both creating a this magnificient museum and also keeping it in a great condition. You should see the final mosaic (gypsy girl), excellent mosaic and perfectly presented."
150,Amazing!!,"An absolute must when visiting Gaziantep. The mosaics are more than two thousand years old, are breathtaking. The museum is huge and will require at least two hours to visit . The excavations have been discovered about the last fifteen years or so and date back to Roman times and are gorgeous."
151,Small but stunning ,The museum contains excellent archaeological finds and mosaics.There is also an important mosai floor of a church.The museum is new and well done.
152,"Excellent museum, not to be missed when in Gaziantep",fantastic ambiance and history very amazing mozaik arts form zeugma . it's Ã§oksesli on mondays but if you in gaziantep you must see this museum
153,Home of the alluring Gypsy Girl Mosaic,"Zeugma Mosaic Museum is one of the best in the world containing mosaics from B:C. You should also visit the Zeugma antique city from which these mosaics come from, about 1 hour from Gaziantep near Birecik Dam."
154,Best museum ever,"The museum was a great experience for us, the conception of the pieces, the explanations were greatThere is a short 3D movie for extra5 lira"
155,Very modern museum,It was a marvellous museum from the start to the finish. I was shocked when I saw the very big floor mosaics everone is a mithological mit. The kadt shock is the gipsy girl conserved in a very special room. Her eyes follow you when you move in the room.
156,Just wonderful,It should be seen to visit the Zeugma Mosaic Museum at Gaziantep.It is Modern museum . Entry fee is cheap
157,It is what it is,"A gorgeously, aesthetic and well planned exhibit of beautiful mosaics from Zeugma.  This is definitely the gem of Gaziantep and a gem in the anthropological/archaeological crown of Turkey, ""the biggest museum in the world"".  As you enter, the exhibit is set so that you feel you are in a late Roman courtyard.  Make sure you rent the audio as there is more detailed information than is posted in the exhibit.  Although the staff knows little English many made efforts to help me with questions and directions and were quite friendly.  It is a definite must see museum."
158,Impressive,If you love ancient mosaics then this will blow you away. I have visited Ravenna Italy and whilst these are mind blowingly beautiful those at Zeugma will add another dimension to the WOW factor scale.
159,Best mosaics of Roman culture,"Although currently part of the museum is closed for refurbishment there's still plenty to see.It is/was the second largest mosaic museum in the world but possibly the relatively new mosaic museum in Antakya, Hatay might have this title now.I particularly like the friezes and there are some very detailed mosaics. Sadly some parts were stolen before they were removed and secured.Toilets weren't clean."
160,Worth Visiting,Definitely the must see location with Marvelous mosaics from the city of zeugma. Artifacts from the eastern Roman Empire.
161,Great Place,This is where the Gypsy girl is. The whole museum is full of great mosaic works. If you are at Gaziantep dont leave without visiting.
162,The best Mosaic museum ever seen,A very rich collection of unique mosaic decorations. The layout is quite good and the audio recording gives very detailed information
163,Small but nice,"With all the refugees coming from Syria you want to be away.Yet, take a trip, even in & out and see the mosaic .And if I may I should also recommend to see the mosaics in SanliurfaArnon"
164,A perfect mosaic museum,"This beautiful museum houses spectacular historic mosaics. We took the family and enjoyed spending a rainy day here. If youâre in the area, donât miss it!"
165,Great Museum ,"I have been to many of the mosaic museums this Levant, However this museum is the best I've been to indeed. Most of the Mosaics are very well preserved with very high sense of fine art, especially of those of Zeugma. You will see in other rooms some christian mosaics, some with Syriac writing, but the Zeugma ones are the best really. The visit to the museum has triggered our curiosity and the we headed to the Euphrates on the very next day and stopped for an hour at the site itself by the reservoir. We saw some villas covered for protection and some of the mosaics kept on location. Do not leave Antep until you see it."
166,Best Mosaic Museums,A stunning Exhibitionfrom the entry overlooking an Art piece Ã¶f traveling ThÃ© Silk Road though storylines as life was
167,"Amazing , must see","Modern, spacious museum, medium sized, well conceived and executed.  Mosaics are stunning, even if you don't like museums, this one is worth a visit."
168,Magnificent,Such an amazing place... Lots of incredible history and mosaics. Every history lover should visit this place..
169,Worth to see.,"A beautiful, modern structure with amazing,preserved large mosaics----some laid out on the floor, others on the walls.   Good overall views from the balcony and great photo ops. Only problem is finding the elevators and exits.  Nice areas to relax and have refreshments under the  covered sitting areas outdoors."
170,a true treasure trove,A great museum displaying beautiful mosaics uncovered from the ancient city of Zeugma. The plaques provide great commentary on the mosaics. Spend around 2 hrs here.
171,Walk in the Past,"The Museum is a collection of mosaics transported from the nearby ancient Roman city of Zeugma. It is quite fascinating for those who love history or Greco/Roman mythology but others would likely become bored quickly. Honestly, I do not know what the cost was since I got in free with my Muzekart (Turkish museum pass)."
172,Absolutely must be seen,"Beautiful mosaics reminding you of the past cultures. Gypsy Girl is the most famous of them all. This is a must see,if you visit G.Antep."
173,Eden of Mosaics,"Everyone visiting Turkey should come to Gaziantep and see this museum. It is the best mosaic museum I had ever seen. All the historic art masterpieces are breath takingly beautiful. You sometimes feel that they're not real. The mosaic panels once decorating the floors, pools and walls of the Roman houses of the 4th century were mostly kept almost in perfect condition. ThÃ© music playing and the lights and design of the presentation of these historic pieces are so great that you enjoy spending hours at the museum."
174,Gipsy Girl at upper floor - must see !!!,"What's on display is so amazing, as well as alot of the museum techniques used. However, the devil is hidden in the details and this museum always flops in the details, with lack of some information that could easily be provided, the attitude of personnel, lack of supervision, etc. What should be an unforgettable experience leaves you with awe in your eyes at what you see nut a sour taste in your mouth for what could be. Still, I went to this city twice just to see this museum, and I can do it again."
175,Very impressive museum,"One of the ""absolutely must go and see"" places! This museum in the city of Gaziantep is supposed to be the second largest mosaic museum in the world. It contains rare and beautiful mosaic arts."
176,Not boring museum,The museum is full of historical wonders. There are many mosaics to see from the ancient Greek times. Especially the mosaic of gypsy girl is amazing. This place has to be in your bucket list without any excuse.
177,Best attraction in Gaziantep,"A must see place in Turkey, especially if you are in Gaziantep. Unbelievable, great mosaics from thousands years ago. Get an audio guide and enjoy the amazing mosaics.."
178,"Awasome mosaic museum, definetly worth a trip","I like it.Nice place to visit if you are interested in history. We went with a big family, it was interesting."
179,Most Incredible Artistry,The beautiful mosaics from the ancient Roman city of Zeugma (about 60 kilometers east of Antep) on the shores of river Euphrates are skillfully displayed. The visitor feels like walking in the rich villa of a Roman dignitary. The museum building itself is very impressive as well.
180,Amazing Mosaics!,Our group tour of eastern Turkey visited this museum one morning. The quality and workmanship of some of the mosaics was simply amazing! Worth a visit.
181,Beautiful collection - worth a visit,"This is a definite holiday destination.  Lots to see and very well arranged.  There is a small entry fee, if you don't have the national museum pass.  Really good.  Don't miss the Gypsy Girl, which is hidden in a black room in the back of the second floor."
182,"Beautiful place, worth a visit!",This was a surprise stop on our tour of Turkey and it was incredible!  The mosaics are laid out and displayed beautifully.  Some are shown as if they were still in the room they came from.  Couldn't praise the museum more!  Outstanding!!
183,300 BC,Priceless historical artifacts . Mosaics . There are many characteristics that puts BelkÃ½s? Zeugma in a distinguished position among similar antique sites in Anatolia.One of these is the style in the sculpture and teliefs.Samples of this uniqe style can be seen at many museums around Turkey the world. The main importance of Zeugma are the Roman villas and the floor mosaics found in them only.A small number of which could be brought to daylight by the excavations.These hillside villas which similars can only be see in Ephesus Antique city in Turkey and they carry utmost importance archeologically. Researches by experts have proved that once the excavations are completed Gaziantep Museum will be the leading mosaic Museum in the world.The reason it is on a cross road and itâs a trade and military city it has been very popular by the artists.Even the retired officers had a attracted the best artists of the period.This way they have left behind the masterpieces of mosaics and fresks which is today a big issue.
184,A world-class mosaic museum; not to be missed!,"You can experience an ancient Roman atmosphere inside the museum and a gorgeous, magnificent 3-D art of antÄ±que times. I'm speechless......"
185,Must visit,One of the best museums in Turkey. Don't miss to watch the cinema (costs 5 tl / person) before taking the tour to have a general knowledge.
186,Phenomenal!!!,"gorgeous display of amazing mosaics, elegantly displayed.  Nice building, nice opportunity to get up close and personal with these gorgeous historic artworks"
187,best thing to do except eat in Antep,The most beautiful and well organised museum i have ever seen in Turkey. Amazing collection of mosaics which you'll never see anywhere in the world. Audioguides are provided. Museum has also a nice gift shop and a cafe. definetly a must-see place in Gaziantep
188,Bucket List for Mosaic Fans,"Best Mosaics I ever saw in my life. This museum is the world's largest mosaic museum. They have over 2000 years old Zeugma (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeugma,_Commagene) mosaics, they displayed them very Clear & Perfect way. Specially Gypsy Girl (http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87ingene_K%C4%B1z%C4%B1) become museum's symbol."
189,It is a must to see museum,Great musuem useful to know more about antep history.The audio guide is ok for the first 15 mins then it turns boring
190,One of most beautiful museums in Turkey,"Thank to the prominent works of Ministry of Culture, nicely preserved mosaics are demonstrated in a series of fluent themes. One of those to-be-seen-before-one-dies kind of things"
191,Great mosaics. Not crowded.,"This is a fascinating tour through carefully restored mosaics from the 2nd through the 5th century in the region. It is best to read up a bit on the historical background of the area. Although there are many explanations in Turkish and English for many mosaics, they somehow do not give a full historical context to these. amazing exhibits. I left wanting to know more about the mosaic process and the civilizations and local historical environments which gave rise to these wonderful exhibits."
192,if you havent visited Zeugma mesuem you have not seen mosaic mesuem.,We enjoyed every single mosaic. Of course lots of Greek but even one Syriac which I had never seen before. Superb building with gift shop etc.
193,Very interesting,"Gaziantep is a historical city known for having the best baklava in Turkey.  I was there to visit a friend and was not expecting much as it is not high on the list of Turkish cities that tourists would normally visit.  Therefore when I had a chance to visit the mosaic museum I did not anticipate how beautiful the displays would be.  many of the mosaics laid out on the floor were so well made, they looked like freshly laid carpets made out of fabric rather than what must be millions of tiny stones.  the museum facade is very modern and the place is absolutely worth a visit.  it's a work in progress, as more displays are being added in other sections of the museum.  Well worth a visit.  And BTW, yes, the baklava is delicious!"
194,Divine,"Everything that other reviewers have said is true. This is a wonderful exhibition of the rescued mosaics of Zeugma, some in reconstructed settings of the original buildings that they were found in. It also makes you appreciate the lengths that looters will go to to remove parts of mosaics just to serve the selfish greed of the few. My favourite mosaic were not actually from Zeugma itself, but from the region. One, with a doppy-looking dog, looks like the parents went away for a weekend and told the kids to amuse themselves with the box of mosaic tiles. It's hilarious! The other came from a church, and there is writing on either side of a figure. The strange thing is that the `writing' is not in any known local script! Check it out."
195,Fascinating,"This museum is definitely the treasure in this region. While you spoil yourself with delicious food of Gaziantep, you also satisfy your spirit with the spectacular mosaics from the Hellenistic Era. The museum shop also has nice things with affordable price. Halil Usta is very close to the museum (walking distance) and should not be missed."
196,good morning out,"A gem of a museum in Gaziantep, modern cool and remarkably user friendly.  The mosaic displays are amazing and the information provided is available in English as wellnas Turkish.  There are a few interactive displays that are fun to use and captured everyones interest in the mosaics represented.  This is not a museum packed with a huge variety of artifacts, instead it is true to its theme."
197,Everyone must see there,"NUMBER ONE attraction in all of southeastern Turkey (well, Gaziantep is not exactly in southeastern part of the country). It is the biggest Mosaic Museum (may be second after the one in Tunusia) in the world.You HAVE to see the ""Gipsy Girl"" with your own eyes. No photo or video can reflect the same look in her eyes. You just go there and see it !"
198,A Must in Gaziantep (Aintab/Antep),The museum is one of the best arranged museums I have ever seen.  The mosaics on display are the mosaics salvaged from the flooding of the dam construction.I learnt that there are still a vast amount of excavation to be made on site but they need funding and are looking for international support.Anyone interested in history should help them.
199,Surprisingly good,One should go the Gaziantep only fÄ±r this museum if for nothing else.... The largesr Roman mosaic display is waiting for you to admire
200,I adored this museum,"A magnificent museum on the historical silk road. Zeugma Museum is the biggest mosaic museum on the world, containing 1700m2 of mosaics. I recommend to have an audio guide in order to learn the stories behind the mosaics."
201,A must see,"So far best place I have seen in gaziantep, to be honest I am not fun of museums but this is something different love it"
202,Trip to Turkey would not be completed with visiting this museum,A place full of history and the real feeling of ancient times. You can really be for a while a part of this place. Beautiful museum and really worth a visit.
203,History of Humanity,We had family trip to Gaziantep with the kids. We visited this museum on a Saturday afternoon. When you are getting the the tickets you are asked if you want to join the the 3D video of History of Zeugma Film which take aproximately 12 minutes. We joined it and I recommend you to do it before you visit the museum. The rest is history. The museum will take you to 2000 years earlier. Enjoy it...
204,Stunning!,"An excellent museum.  It's mosaics, most of which were excavated from the ancient Roman city site of Zeugma are beautiful.  I was amazed at the vibrant colors that remained in mosaics that are so very old."
205,Don't miss Zeugma Mosaic museum when in Gaziantep,"The Museum is just magnificent. It really is an Art Museum. The extent and quality of the mosaics is just overwhelming. The entire museum is very well laid out to optimise the viewing of the extensive mosaics.At the rear of the Museum is a darkened room displaying the famous ""Gypsy Girl"" or is it really the face of a young Alexander the Great? The controversy continues.This should be one of the most stunning museums you'll find in Turkey, and that's saying something."
206,A must if you are in Gaziantep,"If you are in Gaziantep.. this is the best place to visit.The 3D show wasn't at a very good quality but for a 5 TL show, you get for what pay."
207,Marvelous mosaics!,"Extensive collection of amazing mosaics attractively displayed.  In many case the explanations (English and Turkish)  give captivating back stories for specific mosaics.  Even if you're museum-weary, you should seek out this museum across the railroad tracks."
208,A Journey in History,this is a must visit if you are at gaziantep. it is a wonderful museum with lots to see and incredible archeological finds.
209,Gypsy Girl,Simply superb mosaics beautifully kept and displayed. The gypsy girl kept screened off and in low light is mind blowing.
210,Amazing place,We went to Gaziantep to visit Zeugma mosaic museum.we enjoyed it to see how people made so beautiful mosaics all around anatolia.mosaics are from romans.museum was well designed and you can see everyhing in an order.I advice all to see this museum and culture.
211,Good Collection,Well laid out. Stunning Roman era mosaics. The coffee in the museum cafe is however to be avoided! We walked from Centre which takes about 30 mins. I would recommend a taxi which we got back for 18 lira
212,Beautiful museum and unexpected pleasure,"If you are passing by the city, this Mosaic museum should not be missed.A very nice collection of old mosaic from ancient city of Zeugma, good arranged and well kept inside museum with nice ambience, perfect for about 1 hour visit.Iconic for this exposition, is the Gypsy Lady, as they call it, a remarcable piece, which comes close to the Monalisa painting in therms of feeling while looking at it.They say there are only 3 mosaic museums in the world, and this one should be the best of them all, therefore is a must see for everyone."
213,great mosaics,It is for anyone visiting Gaziantep. Especially it is a good choice for a rainy cold winter day. You could spend a few hours of your day after a nice breakfast or lunch taking pictures and videos.
214,Great pieces,I was surprised to see the way items have been restored at this museum. One can just sit there and wonder these creations many centuries ago. It is really a wonder. I you need to visit - do visit on a weekday because weekends can be very noisy - almost like a market place and also it can be crowded. It's worth going there a second time to absorb the art - especially the 3-dimensional art and mosaic - never have I seen such a wonder before!
215,Mosaics,A must see in gaziantep. Wowww both the mosaic and the presentation is great. Do not forget your mouseum entrance card...
216,Gaziantep Gem!!,Just wow. It is unbelievable. Lots to see. The mosaics are unique. Museum entry fees are very cheap.
217,Zeugma mozaik muzesi,"There is a great collection of mosaics here, some are completely intact while others in various states of incomplete condition.  Note that the collection will be expanding (no date was given) as they were installing additional mosaics in an adjacent building.  Photography is allowed.  Allow 1 to 1.5hrs visiting."
218,Beautiful mosaics,You must save half a day to see this nice museum if you are interested in anatolian history in Roman times. Very aesthetic persentation of the mosaics; though it would be better to have an opnion about the archeological processes; e.g. videos or photos about how they were found and resurfaced.
219,An Exhilarating Experience!,One of the best museums I have ever been. Get an audio guide and listen to the all items with every details available.Very exciting way of brushing up your mythology knowledge.
220,Zeugma Museum: The crown of mosaic preservation,"This museum could be in Rome, Jerusalem or Cairo: I was positively surprised to find such a modern, well-done museum tucked away on the Gaziantep ring-road. The mosaic floors from the (now underwater) village of Zeugma are absolutely stunning with a colour and quality I have only seen before at Pompeii....and i'm not easily impressed when it comes to modern ways of exhibiting ancient treasures. A big point for improvement is the lack of descriptions and lack of historic story-telling: this would really add to the understanding and experience, I'm sure they can do this. The much celebrated 'Gypsy-girl' mosaic is indeed a Mona Lisa comparison worthy."
221,amazing detailed mosaics from 300a.d.,"Zeugma mosaic museum is the largest mosaic museum in Turkey. It is also the second largest mosaic museum in the world.The museum tries to show its visitors a flavour of the lifestyle, culture and beliefs of the people living at that time in the city,constructed according to the architecture of the time.There is a digital space for children at the entrance of the museum. Entrance 24 TL, moreover, the museum card is valid.You will find yourself experiencing this moment in history while touring among these magnificent ruins. When you come to Gaziantep, you should definitely go there.Have a nice trip."
222,great mosaics to see!,"Lovers of art and design should visit this museum to feast their eyes over inspiring ancient mosaic designs that are as old as 2,000 years, salvaged from the ruins of public baths and villas found around the area! They are bound to be in awe of these masterfully-crafted mosaic designs, notably the iconic Gypsy Girl, proof of the ancient local craftsmenâs outstanding workmanship and sense of aesthetics. The museum enriches your visit to Gaziantep even more!"
223,Lovely mythological arts,It is shocking how beautiful are the mosaic scenes. Then you look closer at the minuscule size of each tile piece. Then you notice that the mosaic is extensive in size. Wonderful to view.
224,Unique Historical Pieces,An exceptional collection of Roman mosaics. Some are intact after two thousand years!A must-see place in Gaziantep.
225,Excellent,"Absolutely superb. It is quite literally worth going to the area just to see the museum and to do nothing else. I can add little to the many other five-star reviews. Marvellous mosaics, some of which are huge and mainly intact. Most museums would be delighted to own one and there are dozens, The extent of the exhibits was stunning. The museum itself is excellent, and the mosaics are beautifully displayed, lit and explained in good labelling. In early October we found the place not busy and plenty of opportunity to view the mosaics in peace and quiet. A word of warning .. .. .. there are some beautiful, heavy and expensive (Â£100) books of the mosaics, and to save carrying a book in our luggage on a tour where it might get damaged, we thought we would be able to buy one in England but we could not do so, so if you want one, do get it in the museum shop."
226,World class venue easily visited en route to airport,Amazing pieces of mosaic. Archeology at its finest! This is where you can the precious gypsy girl mosaic also believe to be a mosaic of Alexander the great
227,Mosaics of Eastern Turkey,"I've heard lots of things about Zeugma Museum before. However, mosaics were way beyond my imagination. I don't know how to describe their beauty. A must seen place for the people who love ancient rome and its history.P.S. it costs nearly 20 liras with taxi from the city center. Entrance fee is 15 liras."
228,Zeugma Museum,"Amazing mozaik museum in Gaziantep.You will see many beautiful mozaik art good condition here. I also love the museum shop.Great for family, friends and solo :)"
229,most magnificent,"I saw the history, i saw the ancient time life. Impressive, Gypsy Girl is must to see. You need at least 2 hours to see all mosaics. You will not regret."
230,Renewed Museum is a must in Gaziantep!,There are so many mosaics with great stories behind. It's a MUST see. The Gypsy Girl is great. The detail in the mosaics is unbelievable
231,Gorgeous Mosaics,The most magnificent mosaics you will ever see - huge and complex all housed in an excellent modern buillding.
232,Magnificent!,It was a privilege to see such magnificent mosaics from the 2nd to 5th century AD that have been saved .Allow at least 1.5 hours to wander around the room size mosacics.  A 3D movie and audio guide are available at extra cost.
233,Amazing mosaics,"Stunning, exciting museum. Should visit when you travel to Gaziantep. You need appx. 1.5 hours to visit."
234,Interactive Mosaic Experience,"This was one of the best museums I've been so far. Well at least one of my favorites. Mosaics are beautiful. Some original artifacts like columns and fountains are included in exhibition too, what brings up very special atmosphere. For some mosaics you can unravel their stories, what they represented, what this contributed to our perceptions of that times and how they excavated and transported them."
235,Wonderful experience,"It is claimed that this is the largest museum of antique mosaics existing in the world. I don't know whether the claim is correct but, for sure, this is the most impressive collection of mosaics that I have seen in my life. The exhibit is pleasant and thrilling, and even a child may enjoy it, as I could see during my visit. Iâm not an expert, but the museum appeared to me world class, and would also look excellent in culturally sophisticated cities like London and Berlin. In my opinion, its visit justifies a trip to Gaziantep.Zeugma was a Roman city located on the banks of the river Euphrates, about 50 kilometres east of Gaziantep; it was the main outpost of the Romans in the region (about 3000 kilometres away from Rome!) and a very rich town. The mosaics displayed in this museum belonged to Roman villas of the 1st and 2nd century which were located in Zeugma and nearby villages. In 1990 a dam was built on the river Euphrates and the remains of the Roman villas were engulfed by water; a lot of mosaics were however salvaged and brought to Gaziantep; 96 of them, for more than 5000 square metres, are now on display, while others are being restored. The mosaics are absolutely wonderful. There are representations of humans and animals (wild or domesticated), gods and botanical subjects (flowers and trees), mythological scenes and portraits; some mosaics with geometric patterns are worthy a modern abstract painting.The conception and the design of the museum are perfect. Also the lighting is perfect. The largest mosaics are laid on the ground. Those of more limited dimensions (less than 3-4 metres in height) are attached to the walls and can be comfortably looked at, like the paintings in an art gallery; these ones receive oblique light, and the fine texture of the mosaic is clearly highlighted: absolutely fantastic!  Some elevated walkways with a glass floor and a balcony located on the upper floor allow good viewing of the mosaics lain on the floor. Around some mosaics the environment they were in was partially rebuilt, with the use of columns and statues recuperated on site. Appropriate information is posted near each mosaic, both in Turkish and English; it is regrettable that this information is sometimes badly lighted or in an inconvenient position, so that it is difficult to read it or take a photo. An interactive information system is also available. The museum is set in two distinct buildings, with a total of 5 exhibition floors. A third building contains a convention centre.The museum is not far from the centre of the town, and is better reached by taxi. It is open from 9:00 to 17:00 (in winter) and from 9:00 to 19:00 (in summer), except on Monday. Admission is 15 Liras (about 3 â¬). The infrastructures of the museum include: full accessibility, lots of seats, various restrooms in good conditions, a souvenir shop, a pleasant coffee-shop in the atrium. The visit will certainly take more than one hour."
236,Mozaic world,This museum should be in your to do list when you go Gaziantep.. It takes approximately 1 hour to see everything.. absolutely worth to visit
237,Incredible.  World class.,There is nothing much to say. It is a perfectly curated museum. If you are in Gaziantep you should see it.
238,A good organised museum,"Gaziantep mozaic museum is great for every range of visitors,you will witness not only the wonderful work of ancient craftsmen, but also discover the mystery of gypsy girl's story, there are sections for the kids, great souvenirs for friends and family."
239,amazing mosaics...,Museums are not my interest.But this museum has something special to wonder about .I recommend to visit.Make sure you have cash because shop has no terminal for plastic money .
240,Have you ever thought what to do with kids while visiting a museum?,This museum is a must when visiting Gaziantepe - huge and plentiful displays to spend hours looking at - nice modern museum too.  Please visit!
241,ZEUGMA-ONE OF THE WORLDâS MOST ORIGINAL MOSAIC MUSEUMS,To find the marvels of ancient civilization carefully preserved in a beautiful building enhances your understanding of these treasures.
242,Thrilling Experience,"This museum not only has an extraordinary collection of mosaics, it displays them in a way that one can imagine looking at them rooms of Roman villas in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The atmosphere created makes this visit a memorable experience. The labels are very informative and the English translations are good. This museum is reason enough to make a stop in Gaziantep, but there are other interesting things to see in town too."
243,Very nice visit to the past,"A museum of mosaics second to none, not even to the national Lebanese Museum in Beirut / and that means something. The architectural layout is dernier cri and there is a wonderful vieew over Gaziantep from a bridge linking two main buildings."
244,A must visit,If you visit Gaziantep this is a must visit place. This must be the earliest tiles ever from about 300AD
245,History - what a mystery,"When I read a description of this museum as having ""the world's best mosaic collection"", I was a bit skeptical.  However, the Zeugma Mosaic Museum lives up to the billing and more.Opened in 2012, this museum is laid out very well and has an incredible number of complete mosaics.  The way they are displayed allows the visitor to experience the life around these mosaics - whether they were meant to be the floor of a living area or the bottom of shallow pools.  The audio tour is excellent and well-worth the price.  The commentators explain the mosaic artistically and contextually.  Additionally, often they also comment on where the mosaic was found and what it took to excavate it.  This museum is a highlight to any trip to Gaziantep!"
246,Fantastic,"This may be the best museum of its type, certainly the best I have visited. Cool, perfectly lit, beautifully displayed and very informatively labelled.The museum apparently holds the largest mosaic collection in the world. Allow yourself plenty of time to see everything and all for only 15 TL - an absolute bargain! Do not miss this place."
247,The largest in the world,"Itâs magical! I would never guess this museum could be this big. Gypsy girl is just amazing, entrance is 20tl if you dont have a museum pass or museum card, but definitely worth every penny."
248,Take your time,"A very interesting visit at the Zeugma museum, where you can see various mosaics from the Greek and Roman periods. The explanations are both in English and Turkish.A great way to spend 2 hours in Gaziantep during the week or during the weekend."
249,Mosaics of Zeugma,"I have visited this museum twice. Most recently 1st May this year.  Prior to this I stronly recommend a visit to Zeugma, founded by one of the generals of Alexandeer the Great and on the Euphrates.  At Zeugma you will see the site (and other mosaics in situ) from which many of the museum situated mosaics rescued from the flooding of the Euphrates valley at this point by the construction of a dam.  I can not remember how much it cost to get in but it is one of the most magnificant museums I have been to; both in terms of content and the building itself. Tied in with our Zeugma visit it was an unforgettable trip.  Our tour included going to Zeugma first so you need to ask about getting there.  My photo not too good."
250,So very well done,I went to Gaziantep for a business trip and had a chance to visit the gorgious museum.Definitely worth visiting. Highly recommended.
251,Amazing Wonders of the Ancient World,Zeugma is One of the most beautiful museums Iâve ever been to. Too bad that they could not preserve the whole city before it was demolished by Euphrates. Euphrates gave life to the city and it destroyed.
252,An absolute must when you visit Gaziantep!,This is a must-see site if you are at Gaziantep. All the historical artifacts have been very well kept and you will be amazed to see that it is like magical trip way back to historical times.
253,Worth to see,"Nothing much to say. Spent hours inside and wanted to stay there even after long hours. I wish I could get a blanket and sleep among that history. You can't believe what people did in the 1st & 2nd & 3rd centuries, and what we are doing in the 21st century.Single entrance fee for an adult is 15 TL (apprx 4 Eur or 4 Dollars). Free for underage children."
254,The best in the world,This is the most imcredible collection of Mosaics and artefacts I have ever seen. It is a very large well planned museum of the highest quality. With good shops with excellent quality souveneirs. No restaurant which in a pity and none nearby. Worth a trip and takes good 2 hours to take it all in. Use the display guides and screens. Amble at your own pace. It was quiet this time of week/year so check opening times and come early.
255,Fantastic unbelieveable collection.,Try and go after 10am and then the bus loads have started moving on. They don't stand around and if you go alone it is best to hang back and so you get the mosaics to yourself. Take your time and enjoy the art work. These works of art are worth gazing at and taking in all the designs and complicated tiny pieces of stone used at the time.
256,Wonderful mosaics,"There are a number of Turkish museums that display mosaics, but none that match the artistry of this museum. Huge props to the architects, graphic designers, curators, and all the museum personnel that put this together. Entry price is quite reasonable as well for one of the top museums in the country."
257,One of the best on thr world,"If you are interested in the art of mosaics it's a must see, quite big and fun. The gift shop are good but the prices little bit high and the entry is ten Turkish lira"
258,You should visit Gaziantep just to see this museum,worth a visit.  good value of money TL 10 which is about Â£2.50.  only takes about an hour and if you go of the audio guide about an hour and a half.  only a short walk to the castle  as well from there.
259,Best mosaic collection and excellent presentation,Number one in its class. A must see museum for all travellers. You will not beleive how they make all these wonderful mosaics with the technology they had at that age.
260,Stunning history,"Anyone who appreciates the beauty of ancient craftsmanship and the thrill of discovery should beat a path here to Gaziantep to see these mosaic works of art beautifully displayed in this magnificent museum. The museum is expertly laid out with marked footpaths and gangplanks skirting around and crossing over massive floor mosaics, while other, smaller creations are mounted on the walls at eye level, inviting close inspection. Invoking the feeling of a ruined Roman villa, the displays are accented by historic columns, and sculptures in varying stages of decrepitude. The statue of Mars the god of war is magnificent.You will feel like an explorer, uncovering ancient treasures as you work your way through the collection, lingering over intricate details evident in each mosaic, not wanting to rush too quickly, yet anticipating what is waiting to be found next. The sense of discovery is all the more heightened because of how recently these artifacts were unearthed. Many of them only became known in the late 1990's and early 2000's after work began on a new dam straddling the Euphrates River where the ancient Roman town of Zeugma thrived in the first and second centuries. Sadly, it would appear from many of the informational plaques in the museum that shortly after the mosaics were found the race was on to save them from the ravages of thieves and rising reservoir waters. It's shocking how many parts of these grand mosaic works of art were brutally hacked out by bandits or simply washed away, and it leaves one wondering what has been lost forever. Incredible patience and expertise must have been required to excavate, transport and reconstruct each one of these amazing mosaics but the benefit is impossible to put a price on. We are the lucky ones who get to view such beauty for the first time in eons. The museum's finest piece by far is a stunning portrait in mosaics named The Gypsy Girl by archaeologists who discovered her. Through the use of creative techniques that would come to be adopted more than a thousand years later by Renaissance portrait painters, the ancient mosaic artist magically transformed a few handfuls of tiny colored tiles into a living face, with contemplative, shining eyes staring back at the viewer with a mixture of joy and sad wonder, making her the Mona Lisa of an earlier age. No photograph could ever come close to capturing her remarkable beauty. Almost as remarkable is the fact that The Gypsy Girl was only saved because her face ended up buried under piles of dirt that was dug up by looters as they greedily rooted up the remainder of the massive mosaic she was originally a part of. We only benefit from their careless haste.This collection of wonders must be added to any itinerary of Anatolia. Indeed, Anatolia should be explored only after first visiting the Zeugma Mosaic Museum."
261,The best mosaics ever,Visiting the Gypsy Girl mosaic is one of my favorite activities when I come to Gaziantep. The city is not only famous with its delicious food but also with its historical places..
262,A must-see site,"I absolutely loved this museum. A blank backdrop for the most amazing mosaics. The fifteen minute 3D show was worth the couple of pounds extra. But highlight for me was the Gypsy Girl of Zeugma, I could have stood there for hours just looking at that one partial mosaic."
263,Definitely a Must to visit in Gaziantep,This museum displays the mosaic collections excavated from the city of Zeugma. The craftsmanship of the Roman artists is truly effective and it can be experienced in this nice museum. One must visit here to see these beautiful pieces as well as people's efforts to protect them over the ages.
264,Great Place,It was the biggest mosaic museum in the world. Gypsy Girl must be seen. Her eyes and nose follow you.
265,Fantastic,"We'd seen the good reviews but were still amazed by the quality and size of this museum.  If anything, we were overwhelmed, there was so much to see.  Usually we see two or three partial mosaics and feel the pull of the past.  Here there are many dozen, spread over several floors and also on the walls - too much to take in during one visit.  And many of them are in fantastically good condition.  Would love to return.If you can, visit early.  By mid-morning coach-loads of people were arriving, some with tour guides, and too many people taking selfies.  Earlier was much pleasanter (and the queues to get in were shorter).Recorded commentaries are available but there is also a good written explanation, in Turkish and in English, by each mosaic.Shop was quite good for in-depth books about historical Turkey.  Worth looking at if spending time in the country or wanting to know more about religious sites in Turkey.Surprised to see life size models of camels along the road outside the museum - demonstrating the Silk Road.  Somewhat incongruous as two lanes of heavy traffic roar past!"
266,A must in Gaziantep,"We are currently in Gaziantep City, trying to discover whatever the adventures take us here. The Mosaics are wonderfully designed as if they are telling secrets behind the Greek mythologies. I hope the archeologists keep up this job in searching for new artifacts and display them to the tourists."
267,Amazing find,"This museum holds mosaics from the height of the art form in the Roman Empire.  Additionally, some of the most regarded artists resided in this area.The size, detail, and artistry will amaze you.  Think of mosaics that cover full rooms or mosaics that when submerged give the impression that fishes are swimming.  The beauty is mind-numbing.The history is also keen as there are stories in the mosaics as to what gods were popular and when or why.  There is also the transition from Roman gods to Christianity when the patterns turned to nature.  There is the story of the mosaics being saved from the flooding waters and also how bath chambers were heated. The museum has listening devices in case you do not have a tour guide.  These devices are available in several different languages."
268,Don't miss it!,"A MUST see , an extraordinary collection of Roman mosaics . It would be great to have a good guide , mine was really bad and fell very short of my expectations"
269,Don't miss it!,hard to believe it was only 10 Lira (about US$ 5).  Definitely worth seeing.   the mosaics and history behind them were very interesting
270,Zeugma is Ancient Greek litl city,"What to call the ancient land that is Turkey today? Most scholars settle for ""Anatolia"", although that means ""east"" and, so, is a Greek/European reference point.Fact is that long before the Turks invaded and made their own in the land named for them today, the place was the home to a number of astonishing civilisations, from the lesser known Gobekli Tepe folk of 12,000 BP and Hittites to better known Greeks and Romans.These latter come together with Turkey's equally astonishing development plans that are visible to the visitor at every point. One of my strongest sensual memories of my recent two (only) trips to Turkey is the smell of concrete dust and drying slabs in the air of most cities since construction is everywhere.All human civilisations needs water and so does Turkey today. To deal with that problem in the less economically strong eastern part of that large land, the ""GAP"" project evolved, irrigating formerly desert places to make them into today's rich agricultural places.But as the trite phrase goes, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.Amongst other things, the GAP involved the flooding of many places, including ancient Zeugma,Established by the Greeks and elaborated by the Romans, ""Zeugma"" was a remote outpost of Empire, but a very favoured one. It was the mosaics that attracted archaeologists to Zeugma, details of which are in this 2012 article:http://www.archaeology.org/issues/44-1211/features/252-features-zeugma-after-the-floodMany of the most spectacular mosaics were saved from the flood and housed in this conceptually and architecturally outstanding building in ""nearby"" Gaziantep.Others have written about their favourite mosaic, but it is the convivial ones (e.g. the ""breakfast"") that most appealed to me. I liked also the way that the walkways occasionally flow over the mosaics. These thick glass walkways, BTW, are tinted blue, I imagine, to replicate how some of these stunning mosaic artworks were found, glowing beneath the encroaching dam lake.The most famous of the mosaics, and found on tea towels and copies everywhere, is the so-called ""Gypsy Girl"" who, you can read on careful informative museum display cards, most likely was neither a gypsy nor a girl. One theory holds that it was Alexander the Great!There is a clever playroom for children as well as a computer controlled ""fish pond"" projected near the entrance. The Zeugma is a place for all sorts really, although I have ticked ""family"" (teens) because they will find it fascinating too. My wife and I found the domestic scenes portrayed, even if the characters were gods, familiar to our 21st century minds. A business traveller could find it a welcome intellectual and emotion break from negotiations. There were plenty of friends there visiting, including a Turkish film crew with an English-speaking presenter.But, to conclude, ""Zeugma"" also means to ""yolk together"" and it a rhetorical category for metaphor. Zeugma the place and Zeugma the museum and their circumstances are excellent metaphors for modern Turkey: absolutely contemporary, stylish, respectful of the past, but with close attention to present development and future progress.Gaziantep or ""brave"" Antep, is a first-rate location for such a museum and a metaphor as it has its tenderly restored old quarter alongside its modern suburbs. There is no doubt that the people of Gaziantep are devout in their beliefs, but their largest supermarket features a double aisle of alcoholic beverages, from local and imported beers to single malts. And that during Ramadan, when other parts of Turkey (e.g. Sanliurfa) had removed all such temptations from its shelves."
271,One of the best museums I've visited,"In case you are deeply interested in mosaics, then Zeugma Museum is a must see for you. Though personally, I like more the mosaic museum of Antakya (I find it cosier and it's definitely richer in terms of variety as it covers a larger geographic area), I have to confess Zeugma is much more modern in terms of museology. And I also believe, Bardo Museum is no longer the number one mosaic museum since Zeugma is open... The museum is located in a spacious building especially designed for this purpose. It's a bit out of the city center but you can easily go by taxi, it does not cost much. Museum Card is valid here. Displays are very satisfactory, every explanation is bilingual (Turkish and English). Audio guides are available. Museum shop is very rich, there are two coffee shops at the courtyard where you can rest. This museum (along with the food of the city) worths enough to plan a special trip to Gaziantep."
272,Beautiful!,an hour or an hour and half is enought to visit. unfortunattelly many mosaics have been stolen . the museum is enterance of the city . you can buy some souvenirs from coffe shop belong the museum must see gipsy girl . but it shown in the a private room no photo or anthing else allowed
273,Impressive collection of mosaic,This is an exceptional museum. The bulk of the collection on display is 2nd-3rd century AD Roman mosaics from one small area. Magically and rapidly rescued from destruction ahead of being buried under water by a new dam. The chiaroscuro shading in the mosaics is something to behold. Absolutely beautiful stuff! One hour will be enough. The shop sells a wonderful hard back covered book of photos of the mosaics for a small fee of 200TL.
274,A Must See,. . . have seen such breathtakingly beautiful mosaics under one roof.  The history behind each of the mosaics is phenomenal especially when it comes to their excavation. We obtained the audio tour and it is highly recommended as you get learn more that what you would otherwise.
275,A truly beautiful museum,I had heard all the hype about this museum and could not wait to see the gypsy girl. I did not think it was possible to have this many such well preserved mosaic pieces. A must see!
276,Must see!,"A spacious state of the art museum. Everything written in English, and the audio guide provides interesting details about almost each mosaic and item ( also i rarely see ipods used as audio guides). Impressive mosaics and interesting stories about greek mythology. Would always recommend if you are in the city. It's best to go their by taxi or car if you have one very easy to get to;we walked there first, but the surrounding was not the best area."
277,Must see.,One of the best museums in the region and maybe the best mosaic museum in the world. A must-see in Gaziantep
278,Worth going to Southern Turkey just for this .. .. .. six stars !,"Our original plan was to spend one night in Gaziantep and then move on towards Eastern Turkey. Having arrived on a Sunday evening we would have missed a visit to the museum since it is closed on Mondays, so after having read several reviews decided to spend another night and visit the museum before driving on. We are not big fans of indoor museums, but we certainly did not regret staying on as there are quite a few things to do in and around Gaziantep anyway. The museum is quite spacious and the mosaics are very well organized ensuring the flow of people is in one direction.One really has to understand what effort it must have taken to recover and preserve the mosaics in the shortest possible time before they would have been covered by the waters of Euphrates after building the dam. That is a modern feat in archeology one needs to recognize.The mosaics themselves are magnificent and very well preserved. There are a lot of mosaics with fine detail, different designs and motives and most of them are complete. The mosaics of the Zeugma site, which is a drive of around 30 minutes from Gaziantep and now mostly submerged under the waters of Euphrates, are an absolute marvel not to be missed. They are located in the main building of the museum after the ticket office. Do spend 2 - 3 hours here and from the first floor have a look at the ones on the ground floor to get a better perspective.From the main building there is a bridge to another building housing mosaics from other areas nearby, equally well preserved and impressive.Don't miss it."
279,You have to visit...,A great way to spend 1.5 hours in Gaziantep.  Probably the best mosaics I have ever seen.  It will cost you TL10 to get in with a further TL10 (Â£2.50) for a very good audio guide.  Access is really good and I doubt you will find better examples of 2/3 AD mosaics anywhere.  Excellent museum and great value.
280,Wonderful museum,"This was the reason we stopped in Gaziantep and it was well worth it. The range and scale of the mosaics is incredible, and the chance to admire them all in one place is very convenient!It is located on the D-400, the main highway through the city so easy to reach by car, and I imagine by taxi as well.Great Turkish coffee in the cafe as well."
281,Breathtaking new museum,"The museum hosts mosaic from the 2nd to 3rd centuries from the ancient city of Zeugma. The ""smaller"" pieces are hung on the walls while the larger ones are presented on the floor. The featured mosaic, the Gypsy Girl, is presented in a special room on the upper floor. The quality, number, and size of mosaic is impressive. The exhibition hall on the entrance side presents mosaic featuring gods and goddesses, people, and geometric shapes. The exhibition hall across the footbridge presents mosaic that are animal-themed.The computer displays showing the excavation of the museum pieces are nicely done and provide more information on the pieces than the illustration boards. There are also a few, fun visual games on completing a mosaic, or finding the mosaic based on what has been dusted off.Two to three hours would be a good time to spend at the museum."
282,Overwhelming,"I had just no idea of the scale of the operation that was undertaken to rescue these amazing mosaics, rescuing them not just from the rising waters of the reservoir but also from the hands of the looters. The result is quite breathtaking in the quality of the mosaics and in the number and size of them.Beautifully presented in a way that does not allow their security to get between you and the artwork. An absolute must on any Eastern Turkey trip."
283,A beautiful museum.,"Definitely one of the most popular sites in Gaziantep.  When visiting, don't forget to go to Halil Usta behind the museum for the best meats in town."
284,Ancient Mosaics,Zeugma Mosaic Museum reflects a rich historical perspective of the region where the city Gaziantep is located. The Gypsies Girl is also known as early Madonna because her eyes also seem to follow you when you move from left to right. Well go there and check it out to see if it works for you!!??  Dr. B.
285,More than I expected,"Imagine youâre living in a sumptuous Roman villa, in the 2nd century AD, in the city of Zeugma ( close to Gaziantep in South Eastern Turkey ). Imagine the brilliant artists and mosaic makers who would cover the entire floor area of your villa with fabulous mosaics like these. Then, centuries pass, and these villas with all the wealth of their art works get buried. Fast forward to the 20th century when the whole district around Zeugma became a dam creating project to supply water to south eastern Turkey. As the area started to be flooded, archaeologists from all over the world rushed into Turkey to excavate the area as quickly as possible. And fortunately, they were just in time to save these fantastic mosaics for the world. So now, we can all go to the Zeugma Museum in the gorgeous city of Gaziantepe to gaze with wonder on these  works. A very moving experience. Do go!"
286,An excellent museum of mosaics,A must in Gaziantep. This museum hosts one of the largest collections of mosaics in the world. Very impressive.
287,Startling visit into the lives of the past rich & famous,"The Zeugma museum holds a gorgeous collection of Roman(?) mosaics, many from the Euphrates river region just to the east of Gaziantep. On the lower level you can walk among the mosaics and from the upper level you can either take in the view from the balcony or see the famous ""gypsy girl"" mosaic. The museum is beautifully done, very airy and open. The staff is very kind, even though I don't speak a word of Turkish, and they did their best.The English translations on the artworks are odd at best and incomprehensible at worst, but I can't complain. The museum itself is a joy. Highly recommend."
288,Spectacular Mosaics in Ultramodern Museum,The Zeugma is Ancient Greek litl city. Ancient Seleykeia and Apameia. The mosaics Pasifah and Daidalus is beautifoul...
289,Wonderful array if mosaics,"I had no idea that I would step into such a fabulous museum. The array of mosaics on display is brilliant, the museum is well laid out, modern and not crowded (what a bonus). Be warned tickets are single use so when you get to the top floor you need to walk across to the second building over the walkway from there!)"
290,Magical Mosaic displayed Perfectly,"Magnificent mosaics, Gipsy Girl, Poseidon, Venus etc. I advise all Gaziantep travellers to see this museum."
291,Major National Monument,"Gaziantep Zeugma mosaic museum, one of the worldâs orginal mosaic museums in the world, was established in old Turkish Monopoly factory in Gaziantep covering 30.000 square m. in three flats with  large exhibition halls. It was opened in 2011 entertaining by 300.000 visitors annually with a great fame. It is also accepted as one of the leading museums of  the world both its architectural style and consisting of mosaic panels & floor decorations. Most of the mosaics in the museum exhibited are  two thousand years old with the harmony of 13 different colors. Zeugma  is an old settlement near Gaziantep which was founded by Alexander the great in 332 BC named as â Selevkia Euprathes.â  Later the settlement became a large city during the reign of  Antigones I and it was added to Roma with a new name â Zeugmaâ that means â pass â. The Zeugma city became one the wealthiest  settlements of Roman empire in Asia with its large & luxury houses with mosaic decorations reflecting the glory and richness of house owners.  When Roman empire was fallen down, the rich houses are the remain of golden days in the past which are on display in museum.  All the findings from the excavations of Zeugma city  can be seen in three flat museum today. The mosaics are really worth visiting especially world famous â Gipsy girl mosaicâ.  The museum is a must to see in Gaziantep trip."
292,just incredible,"The museum is well worth a visit, with some of the most impressive roman and Greek mosaics on display anywhere."
293,Beautiful museum,"This museum is not to be missed.  If Gaziantep is not on your itinerary, I would recommend a special journey, just to visit this museum.  This museum is well lit and the manner in which the mosaics are displayed is spectacular.  It is also well worth while to visit the site of Zeugma, not far from Gaziantep.  Most of Zeugma has been submerged by the Euphrates River since the construction of a dam, but there is a little to see, and it helps set the scene."
294,Make sure you visit,"I didn't know what to expect, but found this brilliantly presented collection of Roman mosaics fascinating. Not to be missed."
295,Beautiful mosaics of Zeugma: A must see,"Dating back to 5th and 6th century A.C the museum holds mosaics originating from the Roman and Late Antique Periods. ""Gypsy Girl"" is the most important piece and is on the secÄ±nd floor of the museum. It is very close to Halil Usta so after/before visiting the museum you can have the famous ""kusleme kebabi""."

297,NOT to be MISSED - World's Best Mosaics - REALLY,"If you ever come to Gaziantep for a visit, either traveling or for business, this is a place you shouldn't miss. The Gypsy Girl especially displayed in the museum is the highlight of your visit. Despite of the Gypsy Girl, there are also many other mosaics that are incredibly beautiful to observe. I've personally been to this museum 4 times and every time I come it's another surprise."
298,a must see museum in the region,"Close by to Gaziantep overlooking the Euphrates River, the wealthy Romans of the second century build villas.  Unearthed a number of years ago these villas contained absolutely stunning mosaic decorations, floor and wall coverings and statues.  These have been unearthed, and are now housed in a stunningly beautiful museum on the outskirts of the city.  Best museum I've seen in the country and a must see,."
