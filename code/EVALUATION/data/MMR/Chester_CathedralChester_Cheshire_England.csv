0,Nothing to write home about,Had a quick look round - mostly because it was free and raining outside - and was mostly an empty shell.Little of the original remains due to large renovations over time but some lovely memorial stones.
1,Beautiful cathedral,"Visited with my husband whilst on a city break. Entry was free and there were plenty of sanitisers and a one way system in place to ensure Covid safety. The toilets, shop and cafe were also open.  The cathedral is beautiful inside and out with gorgeous grounds and well worthy of‚Ä¶"
2,Beautiful cathedral,Decent visit. It was free and worth a look around.  Beautiful cathedral. Friendly staff. Social distancing maintained.
3,Peaceful,Have visited a few cathedrals. This was free and lovely to walk round as part of visit to Chester but doesnt have the links some other famous cathedrals do so felt underwhelmed.
4,Touching,"Beautiful building lots to see and take in, COVID precautions followed well, track and trace. The Stain glass windows were amazing and the history of the Cathedral incredible well worth a visit if you in the City"
5,Imp spotting,"Visiting Chester for the day and had to stop in at the Cathedral. Covid measures in place, so track and trace details were taken on arrival. Staff at entryway friendly and helpful. A beautiful building to walk around at leisure, taking photos and reading the various information. It was very strange seeing the cathedral with the pews removed as it makes you realise how vast the space actually is! A beautiful place, we spent around 30 minutes wandering around and then visited the cute gift shop."
6,A must!,I had only ever visited Chester Cathedral on school trips and for my university graduation. Decided to pop in on a Saturday afternoon and I was very pleasently surprised. I really enjoyed admiring the historic architecture and building techniques of the cathedral as well as the art which was exhibited inside. A really interesting place to go!
7,A must see,Now open to visitors and I was the first of the day. Lovely cathedral with some stunning stained glass windows. Choir stalls and roof are magnificent. Very peaceful.
8,Gorgeous - must see ,Really enjoyed our visit to this beautiful church. Felt quiet and peaceful. A must visit sort of place.
9,Beautiful Cathedral. Great Gardens.,"Do not miss this if you're passing through Chester! Visited with my partner and young daugher and we had a fantastic time! The Cathedral is an amazing building which makes you stand and stare in absolute awe! The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and informed us of the hand sanitizer stations which were dotted around. Simply amazing building!"
10,Interesting to look around,"Amazing place to visit,Very well thought measures with how to deal with these COVID wary times.Nice shop as well and some nice bits and pieces üëçüèª"
11,A small gem of a cathedral,"Free to visit, beautiful cathedral, fantastic stained glass. Dropped in whilst walking the city walls. Interesting newish detached bell tower. Impressive and peaceful."
12,An oasis amongst the hub bub of the city.,We went here on 10/08/2020. Was lovely to walk about looking at all the old architecture and stained glass windows. There was no charge for entry but donations are appreciated. Covid precautions in place. Was a lovely way to spend a morning
13,Smaller than expected. ,"Beautiful building, incredible history and the architecture was stunning. Just a little put of by the constant ""donations"" boxes absolutely everywhere. We happily made a contribution when we entered but it was every 20feet or so and more please give us money boxes everywhere. Regardless of this it is a must see."
14,Amazing! ,"Looks majestic from the outside, not as impressive as some, but still, a pretty good looking Cathedral, we didnt visit it until after it closed, so werent able to look inside. For free, worth popping to have a look."
15,Wow!,"A lovely Cathedral,  stained glass windows are beautiful. During Covid well run and felt safe.  Plenty to see."
16,Beautiful cathedral,Went here whilst in chester to have a look at the cathedral. An amazing place with fantastic architecture. Easy to access and free. The current artist exhibition looked interesting as well. 
17,"Welcoming, well managed and of course beautiful architecture","We went in as it was open, free of charge (donation requested) and we had not visited it before. It was amazing! We wandered around for about an hour, the garden is also lovely in the centre and around outside. Definitely worth a visit if it's open."
18,Stunning,Worth popping in if you‚Äôre in the city centre to see the architecture and key points of interest inside.
19,History and spirituality,The cathedral is beautiful and at the moment its free entry so its a cheap day out .social distance is in place do safe to go
20,"Interesting, welcoming and well set out for visitors","A magnificent building, some beautiful stained glass. Religious history in bucket loads. Covid restrictions mean that all the seating has been removed. It makes the space quite bare. Social distancing was easy."
21,Wonderful Carol Service,What a stunning cathedral. We called in and spent an hour looking around. Really well managed and would say is a must if you visit this beautiful city.
22,Fabulous ,The doors opposite the altar are open now. Normally this is for royalty I was told. Christine Williams receptionist on the door was very welcoming. We had a chat about covid and lockdown. It was nice to speak to someone. My boys and I said a prayer and lit candles. Such a peaceful time
23,Worth a wonder around,"We were really excited to visit the beautiful gardens here while we had our stay in Chester, to find when we got there and went to enter the gates a staff member rushed over to us from the restaurant saying we couldn't have a look at the building unless we were getting food or drink."
24,Lovely Sunday Morning Service,Interesting cathedral worth spending an hour or so exploring. Some beautiful old memorials and religious interpretations. Also some modern art on display including a very unusual version of The Last SupperStaff were friendly and helpful making time to come and speak to visitors.Track and trace as you go in.
25,Beautiful  cathedral,What a beautiful Cathedral.  Free to enter with no pressure to donate although there are donation boxes doted around.  The kids loved the Lego cathedral that is currently under construction - a really fun idea and really helped them see how big the building is.  You are free to‚Ä¶
26,Beautiful building,Excellent visit well worth the trip alone. Very interesting place full of history. I loved the vastness of it and the stained glass windows.
27,Lovely cathedral ,Loved our visit to the cathedral. Safe & sanitised. Really interesting building & faith building elements were encouraging too.
28,Outstanding,A beautiful building with well kept gardens. Plenty of benches to sit and take the weight off after a day of walking around Chester.
29,Beautiful stain glass windows ,Good place to go to cool down.  The building is beautiful and the staff have done everything to ensure it was safeWhilst we were there there was an art exhibition.  Loved the Lego miniature on the cathedral.
30,Great day out,There are several lovely buildings in Chester however this one i feel is not. It didn't appeal to me and found it dull and not inviting but that is just my opinion and others will see it differently.
31,Beautiful building,Worth visiting just to take a few minutes out of a busy day and find a quiet and peaceful space. Amazing building and history.
32,Chester vacation,We usually watch the Sunday morning service on UTube so it was a real treat to actually attend the cathedral.  We booked seats to attend on 6th September.  The congregation were well spaced out and all staff and members of the congregation wore masks.  The service was lovely and the singing (one choir member) was utterly sublime.  Will definitely attend again.
33,Disappointed,It is free entry but they do ask for a ¬£4 donation.Its smaller than i expected and only takes a short time but i fell in love with the hidden garden - follow the cloisters round past the cafe and gift shop till you cant go any further. Door on the left.
34,Beautiful place,Beautiful building. Stained glass is stunning. Interesting place to visit. Staff helpful and excellent Covid safety.
35,Awesome,"Beautiful building, totally awe inspiring.  Donations requested, but totally worth giving generously; friendly staff and track and trace in place.  Loved it, spent a good couple of hours wandering around and will definitely return."
36,Interesting,"Was a lovely visit. The architecture was stunning and although I'm not a religious person, I love visiting cathedrals and taking in the sights. Free entry with donations accepted. A must visit if visiting Chester."
37,A day out in Chester ,"A beautiful cathedral, stunning mosaics and stained glass.  Only drawback, we could see people in the garden within the cloisters, but couldn't find the way in."
38,Enjoyed our visit,Whilst spending time in Chester we decided to have a look inside the Cathedral. Even though we couldn‚Äôt sit and admire the architecture we still enjoyed our visit.
39,A must to visit after COVID,"This is a cathedral is set in beautiful grounds and garden, most unusual to see this, well worth walking around the garden. Not the oldest of cathedrals nevertheless it is most impressive. I was interested to read and learn about the Chester Regiment. The cathedral is beautiful and well worth visiting. When we were there, there were interesting crafts to see inside. So nice not to have to pay an entry charge. Maybe due to Covid there weren‚Äôt any pews to sit and contemplate."
40,Family Visit,"Beautiful building, decorated for Christmas which added so much more.We went to the candlelit carol concert and it was magical, the choir were amazing and the place itself was so evocative. One of the speakers did enjoy the sound of his own voice a little too much and his jokes were awful :-)You could sponsor a brick in the scale model to support the cathedral renovations which was a nice touch.The ticket booking process was simple and the organisation once you got there was very professional and efficient.Definitely recommend a visit to the cathedral during normal visiting hours and a carol service if you get a chance - it's worth the extra effort!"
41,Inner Peace,I‚Äôm rarely moved by churches etc but this on got me probably because of the many references to the deaths of service personnel.
42,Lovely cathedral,"Free entry, donations, excellent statues, great tourist attraction, city centre location near to shops and restraints."
43,A day out to Chester ,It was our first visit to the cathedral and what a fascinating place with so much history. Well worth the visit
44,Chester Cathedral,"We love the cathedral, the architecture is amazing, the staff are very friendly and informative, would highly recommend a visit to this cathedral"
45,Lovely little oasis of quiet and calm,"OK I've been to a lot of British cathedrals,  but this one hits the ornate button. The organ is something special as are the choirs pews, the floor  the roof, the history... think you get it. Staff on the money with Covid-19 mitigating measures. Felt perfectly safe. The food in the cafe was excellent and the gift shop tasteful."
46,Excellent first visit for me,"The Cathedral is beautiful - some of the most colourful stained glass, soaring ceilings - just beautiful.  We did have to follow a one-way system around the building.  The only good thing about Covid-19 - there weren't many other tourists.  Sad for the Cathedral, good for us!"
47,Gorgeous Cathedral,"Visited July 2019 - Large Cathedral situated in the centre of Chester, it is a magnificent building and well worth the visit for anyone on a day trip or city break. Centuries of history under one roof. Visited on a Tuesday afternoon with plenty of visitors. Among the attractions inside include the gardens, wishing well fountain and a scale model of the Cathedral in Lego. Also a gift shop at the end. Highly recommended."
48,Beautiful,In the current situation entry was very well managed but also very welcoming at the same time.  It is a beautiful building and the red sandstone used in its construction seems to highlight the lovely stained glass windows.  The darker stonework makes it different to many other English cathedrals but it still has a very spacious feel about it.  One of the highlights of Chester and free entry which is also nice and I am more than happy to make a donation when entry is free of charge.
49,Not Appealing ,We visited as we were passing by. The cathedral is well maintained with lovely gardens to enjoy too.
50,Beautiful ,"One of the best cathedrals in the country.Amazing architecture and so much to explore. Really impressive building with loads of history, especially the tribute to the regiment.Currently free, but a small donation is beneficial"
51,Beautiful but understated,This cathedral is well worth a visit and they have done everything possible to keep people safe during their visit.  Entrance is free but they suggest ¬£4 per person donation (we were happy to give a little more).  There is a stunning stained glass window and you can light a real candle here for family or friends.  The refrectory serves drinks and meals but these are restricted at the moment.
52,Beautiful but without the wow factor of some cathedrals,"Very beautiful cathedral, lots of interesting architecture and stained glass windows. Well worth the visit"
53,Amazing!,"Very well organised. The fact that it is free is fantastic although I would definitely recommend donating if you can as cost to keep it open is phenomenal! Beautiful cathedral, lovely gardens, very peaceful inside with lots to see. Can really feel the history inside and 100% worth a visit should you find yourself in Chester!"
54,Beautiful ,Sadly this cathedral felt soul-less due to the effect of COVID. All the chairs/pews have been removed and too many areas are taped off.  Even some of the stained glass windows are modern. I expect this was a lovely spiritual place pre Covid but on our visit it sadly never gave me the lovely feeling I always get when entering a church.The outside of the building is a great piece of architecture.
55,Beautiful architecture ,A beautiful and very welcoming cathedral .  The Lego model is a wonderful idea!  Always happy to visit this church
56,Well worth visit,"This is a beautiful building to visit, especially during December due to all the decorations. A small donation can be made on entry but is not mandatory. Sometimes you can also catch a glimpse of a choir or orchestra rehearsing, which adds a magical vibe to the experience."
57,Meet God,"This building is stunning, a must if your a tourist in Chester, the architecture is stunning along with the interior design"
58,Stunning Cathedral,To think the woodwork survived the centuries of time is mind boggling.  The Curator was knowledgeable about every question we asked. And free we information we didn't think to ask.
59,Peaceful and ornate,Free to visit cathedral although you can contribute a voluntary recommended donation of ¬£4 to help maintain this beautiful building.
60,Chester Cathedral &  Covid-19,What a beautiful cathedral to visit and spend time. The interior was amazing and I took many photos. You could spend hours inside this place. The shop is also good for value for money and COVID secure. A must see!
61,Interesting and tranquil space ,"The Cathedral needs your donation so please make sure you donate on arrival, some stunning stain glass windows, the lego cathedral is ace, but the best items to see are the imp (up high on the left hand side in the Nave) and the cobweb portrait."
62,Beautiful cathedral,very much worth a visit. free to enter however do request you donate. stunning architecture. just a very pleasant place to visit
63,fantastic sight,I decided to take a visit their today which is fantastic today. I decided to take a visit which they staff was helpful and friendly with good services. The design in the cathedral was fantastic and interesting stuff ever. 
64,City Centrepiece,This stunning cathedral is absolutely beautiful inside and out . The architecture is breathtaking and every stained glass window tells a different story through the times.The guides and people on hand are full of knowledge and you only have to ask them something about the date‚Ä¶
