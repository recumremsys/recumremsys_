0,Popular sightseeing,It's okay not so great or any different from other fort museum you may completely skip it. If you go without a guide you can complete everything in 15 mins with a guide the same will be 2 hour affair ofcourse they will enrich you with the facts and history
1,EXPENSIVE PLACE WITH LESS EXHIBITION,Visit the main entrance and the four gates .. nothing else there for normal tikit. You have to buy 3000rs or more of tikit to visit the blue room etc
2,Marvelous,Max you can go for 200 museum ticket. 1500 rs ticket to see royal darbar is complete waste and that too it does not include museum.. This royal family is opnly looting public by showing their old sofa set and few photos. Shameless family.. Yes eventually they will serve 1 glass juice.. I humbly request you to don't buy 1500 ticket.
3,Beautiful Palace of the Maharajas of Jaipur,If you have good time then take audio guide or go for normal guide.  Beaware of fake guides. Need atleast 2hours for photos and listen audio recording (40min) 
4,A Very beautiful Palace,The entry tickets are high and there is nothing on display. If you can spend 3000 buks more you can probably visit the living quarters of the royalty.
5,"It's Ok, but I think we just tried to squeeze too much in and we didn't enjoy it.",Good place to visit though the entre free is not worth. The Museum's give a feeling of the age and things are well preserved. Take a guide for better history. One time visit is good.
6,Great,"We pay the entrance fee including the guide.  In order to hope to see more personal and special parts  But the unprofessional service of the guide here makes us feel that it is not worth the money lost  The cleanliness of the palace makes us not believe that there are people who actually live.  Some areas have been arranged to be used for weddings.  The tourist management system, queuing before-after is not good.  Overall not impressed  Especially when the guide took us to the souvenir shop at the end of this trip  The more I feel bad  Souvenirs here.  Price and quality are no different from the outside."
7,Amazing Place,I used audio guide to see the two plazas and various museum exhibits. Was ok but not spectacular. Did not pay high price to enter palace. 
8,A great place to visit in Jaipur,"When compared to the entry fee pricing, the palace is not so much worthy. But you can visit the palace for its architecture and historical monuments. The museums dont allow you for pictures. If short of time, then this place can be skipped"
9,Tour Plus Shopping,Didn’t go in as 3500 for tourists to enter Not very impressive from outside  If you want to pay 45 euro entry  Enjoy
10,Magnificent Architecture and frescos ,"We visited with the 700INR foreigner museum ticket (so didn’t go inside) - beautiful palace and courtyards with plenty to see (also plenty to buy!) and the famous door from the front of the Lonely Planet India guide. Expensive, but a must-see if you’re in Jaipur."
11,SPEECHLESS VIEW!,"There are different types of tours you can take to see this palace but I recommend paying the money and taking the full royal tour because it takes you inside the palace and through many of the fabulously decorated rooms. We are not big tour guide people, mostly preferring to do things using our own research, but in this instance the extra access it gave us was worth the cost."
12,Good for a quick visit,"It's one of the places you are ""supposed"" to visit when in Jaipur but at 700Rs for the cheapest (foreigner) ticket I didn't feel I got my money's worth. There are some pretty parts (the lotus door is gorgeous for example) but there wasn't much to make it worth the price. The guards are all desperate for you to have your photo taken with them in the hope of a tip. I can't imagine paying the exorbitant price to see the extra rooms - save yourself a small fortune and look at the pictures online. Plenty of tourist tat shops in here too in case you didn't get enough outside the palace. Keep hold of your ticket as it can be used at a few other sights on the same day or the following day."
13,The place of artifacts,The entry tickets to city palace is 3000/- for complete tour. I feel that is too much for an Indian tourist. The palace is big and we decided to avoid it due to heavy entry charges.
14,Lovely Palace at Jaipur city center,It is in the pink city where many artifacts are placed ... also this is the place to must visit to get the though of the era of the kings and how they lived
15,So many beautiful doorways to admire with elegant staff to give information,We did the museum which is well worth a visit as there was so much to see. There is an option to visit the Palace rooms but this was very expensive and from what I read not really worth it. Give yourself a few hours if you want to see it all.
16,Interesting Complex,"This is a beautiful palace area with much to see.  Especially interesting we’re the armory and textile/clothing exhibits inside. Unfortunately, no photos are allowed as there are very interesting exhibits and some of the armory exhibits are unlike any we’ve seen anywhere else in the world.  Look for the two flags flying at the palace and you’ll know that the king is inside.  As with most sites we saw in this area, a guide is essential to getting the subtle details as you tour the palace."
17,A Palace in the city,Very busy and beautiful but I would recommend other places like the forts over here. It’s expensive entry.
18,Another magnificent Palace,The palace is amazing the only worst thing there is the shops in the palace when we take a guide they take us to the shops. Dont buy anything there they just loot the people in the name of maharaja and tells you every thing that outside these all things might be fake and they…
19,An interesting collection of textiles and arms,We took the splendour city palace tour and we were able to visit special rooms that you do not otherwise have access. The tickets are quite expensive 2000 for students.Nonetheless it was worthwhile. There are 7 floors.There is a blue room which is absolutely great to take pictures. Also the green and red golden room is made for royalty. It was gorgeous! Gold leaves were used all around the walls.At the end of the tour you receive some basic refreshments. We were very lucky to have and excellent guide M.S. mamohan) that explained everything and was very patient while we took thousands of pictures.Thank you so much.It is an expensive tour but it is worthwhile to see the beauty of Jaipur!
20,Lavish lifestyle of past Kings of India,The visit was really very educative and one sees lots of what one his read.The collection is unique and the place is full of visitors specially foreign tourists.  A must visit place on Jaipur trip
21,Beautiful Palace,"The Place was very good but Rs.200  ticket is more, we will have to hire guide to see all galaries inside other wise we do not understand any thing and just have a look and come out"
22,An insight into  historic India,"Definitely recommend getting the most comprehensive ticket package because seeing the inside of the palace is worth it, as is the included tour guide. Otherwise, you'll enjoy the outside pink/orange of the buildings but you will not learn about the arhictecture or history.Bring a student ID for a over 50% discount!Get the tour guide no matter what. One of the best set of tour guides I have ever seen who were incredible knowledable and spoke the entire time, and knew how to take good photos."
23,Amazing wedding,"The palace is beautiful and well maintained. But there is not much to see inside, may be because of that, the tickets are affordable."
24,Not to miss.,Visited as part of a tour.Lovely palace with lots of history as explained by the guide which was interesting.There was a band playing drums etc and there is cafe which is rare.We looked at old clothes etc and artillery in the museum.Worth a visit
25,Lots to see,You must book the full tour with a guide - it really is with it We were there for over 2 hours and found it interesting . Some great views and amazing craftsmanship .
26,One of the best Palaces seen in India, Nice palace i ever seen.It is full of  colours with many  different types of packages for touring the palace
27,Wow!! Stunning,This is another must for Jaipur. Easy to get around and extremely interesting. Some awesome things to see. Take an hour or so. 
28,Beautiful Palace,This is currently residence of jaipur maharaja also. Don't miss the arms gallery that is lovely. Need at least 1 house to cover this place.
29,Excellent City Palace.,"Quite an interesting place located in main city, you would like this place only if you are interested in history of royal kingdoms(how they lived, what they wore etc) and you have not seen much palaces in India. I would avoid this during day time as it becomes very hot and walking around palace becomes difficult. They have different sections like weapons, aircrafts, dresses, bedroom, halls etc. A tour would give you glimpse of how old kingdoms worked. It shouldn't take more than an hour to completely visit this. A part of it is reserved and allowed only if you have taken expensive ticket which i heard isn't worth. And other part where royal family lives is also closed for visitors. It may be worth a visit as Hawa mahal and Jantar mantar are very close to it and they all can be visited in 3-4 hours. There is a huge parking at entrance of palace."
30,Beautiful Palace with intricate courtyards!,I only njoyed this place in Jaipur.  Worth visiting..  You should have good amount of time while visiting this..  Beautiful place.  Don't miss this place in your jaipur visit.
31,A must to visit in Jaipur,"City Palace visit was fasciniting, here you can get to see many things and have a apreciation towards the lifestyle. Although slightly expensive visit but a great experience."
32,Jai not so poor,"There are so many stories and points of interest I would recommend the audio tour at only 100 INR it is super informative.  There is also lots of beautiful elements for a lot of photography opportunities, just note if any of the staff in their local uniforms are in your picture they are quite pushy on expecting a tip from you.  This is a highly recommended visit whilst in town."
33,It is the history,"the ticket start at 700 rs. to see the museum but can't take the photoother tickets were likely 3000, 4500 rs. to go upper floor to visit and take the photo. I feel like they don't mind to care for the historical visiting and learning. But they made as a business way. no worth to go."
34,Enchanting view of Royal life well preserved.,My first suggestion... do not take a guide. There are free audio tours should you need and the important exhibits are well documented. I took a guide and felt rushed around... I could certainly have spent more time marvelling at the beautiful old garments/fabrics and armour on…
35,Worth a visit,We visited early afternoon after the amber fort in the morning. In particular we recommend the textiles section of the museum as there are a few fabulous items from the royal wardrobe. Including those of a 7ft high 4ft wide ruler and another's wedding dress! Some of them…
36,Beautiful place,"Former palace has been converted into 3 museums covering costumes, furniture and paintings. It’s worth 30 minutes of your time."
37,Lovely palace,"Guide called “ASHOK “ took us to see this place, good explanation, it was part of a whole day tour of Jaipur. Well informed talk and help from guide Ashok with crossing the road to get better view."
38,City Palace visit ,"The city palace is well worth a visit, but after the Amber Fort Palace, it’s much smaller, mainly because the Royal family still resides here, just look at the flagpole on the way in, if there’s only one flag the king isn’t in residence, if there’s two he is, simple.It’s got some very interesting articles and clothing on display, and it’s in excellent condition, so if your not Palaced out, it’s only an hour or so for a visit."
39,"Early 18th-century palace, loaded with beautiful art & artifacts","Beautiful palace with amazing deco. Perfect place to get pictures.We went on Friday late morning; it wasn't too busy at all.We ate in their restaurant which was really tasty, although a little expensive.Worth a visit."
40,Great collection,"Probably seen enough palaces this trip, so the most modern one can be hard to impress, having theme based rooms was a good way to understand the life of the maharaja, the photographs were really insightful, the modern aspects of architecture were impressive, with chandeliers and thrones.  All worth a visit even if putting up with Guards asking us to take photos with them for cash was a little off putting."
41,Nice,"The place is ok. Besides the architecture, there isn’t not so much to see there. I think it isn’t a must seen place. "
42,Don’t miss it! ,"It's a very beautiful place. If you in jaipur must go there. In this interesting area with many rooms to view museum, weaponry, textiles, & clothing."
43,A beautiful Palace,Private owned big business. Should reduce the entry fee. And closing time is at 5 pm. Could be a bit later to be better. 
44,Royal Palace visit with guide.,"So this place is one of the most important places to visit in Jaipur. You can go to the palace grounds where everyone visit including museum or you can also pay more or visit the private section, where Jaipur’s royal family are living now, but you won’t see them as they’re on separate floors. And that’s where you’ll find beautifully painted or decorated rooms for great Instagram worthy shots.There’s a high tea cafe and I recommend the chai masala there, it’s one of the best I had in India.You can combine visiting the City Palace with Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar as they’re all within walking proximity from one another. Ask about combined ticket entrance to save more.I would recommend, if you’ve got one day of touring the city to start with Patrika Gate, it’s not historical, but it’s a great place to take photos early in the morning be there at 9am or before that before it gets crowded, then head to Amer/Amber Fort and pass by the Stepwell first which is close. After you’re done have a break then head to City Palace, Hawa Mahal, and Jantar Mantar."
45,Gorgeous place ,"After seeing places such as amber / Agra fort etc, this place is underwhelming.It’s ok, but not worth going out of your way to visit.We bought some fabric from a shop inside the palace which we found out the prices were inflated."
46,Very Enjoyable,Awesome architecture.. Lot of places to visit including museum.. enriched our history knowledge.. one can take guide.. we took audio guide which explained everything about the palace.. must place to visit..
47,Likely the best visit in Jaipur.,Marvelous place.. Really amazed to visit this place. I recommend everyone to visit here atleast once.
48,Nice historic place,Nice Palace for a visit. Not spectacular but worth a short visit. See some areas and Royal costumes.
49,"The entrance fee includes a guide for us.  Compared to the service received 3,500 rupees, it is considered expensive.","How is this 700INR? Compared to other attractions in Jaipur and India this is very expensive. The Palace itself is pleasant, but my visit to the armoury was ruined by a guy following me around asking for money because he pointed at the ceiling and some weapons.When I told him I had no money on me he said he accepted British money."
50,"Beautiful, but entry fee is absurd",Just next to jantar mantar this place must be visited lots of beautiful and rare carving on the palace walls. There is biggest size silver pot here might be of the world. Whenever visiting Jaipur this place is never to be missed. It takes ard 2 hrs
51,Palaces of Jaipur,Very expensive at USD 50 and poor value. You see only a few photos of royal families. Rest of City Palace is fine.
52,Fasciniting visit ,"Be prepared for lots of noisy crowds.It is a bit claustrophobic in parts and hot.Really it is a bit disappointing with some ""no photographs"" areas."
53,Maharajah's residence!,"Palace is looking good and nice to see. However, the prices are extremely to high. You pay a fortune also as a western tourist.Instead of going there you could drive to Tajmahal go there with a guide and you will still save money XD"
54,A royal rip off,Also don't shop there outside city Jaipur. But inside Beautiful peacock door. 100/- RS for this places is very costly .This is a private property so payment also doesn't goes to govt since still owned by Kong's family .Part there is few designs...
55,Outstanding,"We were really disappointed by our experience at the palace. The building is lovely and the museum includes some interesting displays, but the price for foreigners is shockingly high at 700 rupees each. Unfortunately that price will only get you into the museum, the courtyard…"
56,After Many sights in India - this is not spectacular,"The palace is beautiful, but not worth watching from inside considering the cost involved. There are many attractions in the surrounding."
57,Quick Insight Into Royal Life,"A must visit place if you are a person who likes history. What a fantastic place. One observation, these buildings and properties inside lacks  proactive maintenance. "
58,Expensive ,I really like the architectural work of the City Palace. Very beautiful and I enjoye dmy shopping inside as well. The only thing I am curious about is what happens to the entry fees paid. Reason I am saying this as because there are King's families still staying in the palace so…
59,Pretty but expensive ,It's a beautiful place to visit.must hire a guide else you will be lost and may miss a few places. It's sad how commercialized they have made the insides with all shop.
60,Be careful of OVERCHARGING by guides,Some great buildings and continuing the pink theme this Palace has thankfully been retained and is a pleasant way to spend an hour or two exploring. Again no cameras in the main meeting hall but very interesting. Beware taking photos of the guards as they demand rupees…
61,Very interesting.  Don't miss the amazing Astronomical Observatory (Jantar Mantar) next to the City Palace!!!,City palace Jaipur is a must go to place... You get a lot to know about the rich history  when you visit this palace...  We took the audio guide and it was very good. School going kids get discounted tickets if any proof is available.
62,A must see in Jaipur!,It's just opposite to Jantar Mantar. It takes around 2 hours to explore the awesome palace.  It's a must-see attraction at Jaipur.
63,"Expensive, but a must-see in Jaipur","Looks promising but only ok inside. 700inr to get in, not really worth it. The ticket allows access to some other places but we’d already been through the 1000 composite ticket, which was a better value deal access to maybe 8 places."
64,Good one,Citu palace of Jaipur must be visited in night. Night Ticket for an adult is 500 while for kids and student it is 250 but it is worth visiting. They have laser show for half an hour about the history of City Palace. Very few people visits in night. So we captured good photographs. Night visit starts from 6:30 pm and laser shows starts from 7:30 pm. Ticket of the same is given at counter at 6:30 in the evening only. No online ticket available.
65,Experience the royalty,"Its a grand but an expensive affair to visit this attraction. Located at just a walking distance from Jantar mantar, this place has an entry fee of 200 Rs for Indian tourists. Guide charges are heavy at around 400 Rs. However, a guide is necessary to visit this place which stretches to approx 2 kms of area and houses many small museums with lots of information to store in mind."
66,Royal palace,It is one of the beautiful mahal of Jaipur that we liked . One should visit here if they are in Jaipur it is worth visiting here . The architecture of this mahal is very beautiful . And it is well maintained and clean .
67,City Palace,Went here with a guide for a couple of hours.we went early morni g so it wasn't really busy. Very interesting and pretty place to visit.
68,BEAUTIFUL PALACE,"Very good ,i paid 1500/- but worth it if u really want to see royal palace otherwise 200/- ticket for just museum"
69,Average. Not that spectacular ,If in jaipur must go there. Some parts of the palace are very beautiful and unique. Many movies are shooted here.
70,Avoid,This one is a must do with a guide !Really interesting history and was great to get the facts and insights around the Maharajah dynasties
71,Excellent Palace,"Surprising expensive tickets, but you can choose few options. However, it is worth to see and take few pictures."
72,"Expensive To visit, but worthwhile.",A place with great story of bravery. Here you will find belonging of King and his shoulder etc. It may take half or more than half-day to explore this palace...
73,Ok museum entrance. ,"Visiting and enjoying the City Palace Museum is a must. It is a palace complex with courtyards, pavilions & gardens. The palace was built between 1729 and 1732 by the ruler of Amber Sawai Jai Singh II. It became museum in 1959. There are stunning gates with ornate designs and peacock art. SEE photos"
74,City Palace or Pink City and a Living Young Handsome Maharajah. MUST VISIT!,"Amber fort was first in our plan in Jaipur tour. We took a private taxi to go there. The view of the fort both from outside and inside was fantastic. The approach road is too narrow and dirty. Howevwer, the fort is maintained reasonably well. There are lot of people offering…"
75,Average,A wander through this important part of Jaipur and a famous landmark. I look at how the others lives in the distant past. A must when in Jaipur
76,Grand  but expensive,"City Palace is one of the attractions in Jaipur, we saw the palace and understood it with help of a guide. Although the palace is good but there are other better places to see in Jaipur. I would not suggest to avoid it, but in case there is shortage of time then do so.Piece of Advice, NEVER_EVER eat in its Restaurant.....pathetic and exorbitant price of food there. Food in itself was pretty bad. Also, don't shop there. Same quality goods are available in the main road market just outside city palace. You can have better food and at lesser price in other places."
77,A very nice place to visit,We enjoyed our trip to the Palace. To get a full tour with guide which adds access to the blue room and gold room it was a little expensive. Our guide was friendly and kind but his information was limited. He told us the king is 22 years old probably a dozen times and showed us…
78,2nd best attraction in Jaipur,Good place to visit just OPP to jantarmantar and good place to check out the king's belonging it also tell us about how all places are interlinked interesting place
79,"Excellent, must visit",The City Palace of Jaipur is beautiful inside. It's Rajasthani architecture is all around to see and there are several museums one can visit. The textiles and garments that the kings and queens of Jaipur wore are quite interesting. There are also two gigantic silver containers…
80,A Palace Complex,Very old ancient memory in this Palace museum was very good also collection for photo shoot good one
81,Morning Trip,"Well worth visiting, although one of the most expensive entrance fee 700 rupees each for a tourist. Fantastic palace - how the other half lived! Quite amazing given the proverty that was and still is evident in the area.An enjoyable couple of hours"
82,Beautiful Palace,This was a very average palace. The architecture is no where near as beautiful as the Amber fort. They had a good photography collection which was interesting to look at. However one thing I would say is DO NOT get the audio guides. We got 5 and 2 of them stopped working and the…
83,Beautiful palace,Good fort and belongings of ancient people as we can remember our history. Nice to see everthing in one place.
84,Good guide made all the difference!,"Certainly not the most impressive palace you can visit in Rajasthan, but well worth the visit anyway. The portraits of the kings over a step back in time, the large silver containers are the biggest you’ve seen and there are some nice picture opportunities. Beware of the guards…"
85,Nice place.,One looking to see the very old belongings of the earlier people then a must go place. learned a lot of things about the indian culture.
86,Interesting Historic Palace in the center of Walled City,"- This is the palace of present King.- Better to get a guide for a memorable experiance. 300/- is the standard rate for a family (4-5 persons). Don't know if it is more for a group.- Get a ticket from the ticket counter, if I remeber it correcty it was 200/- per person.- It is devided into 6 parts, as per description from the guide.- It has a levish food court as well with altra high prices.- There is a separate fees for visiting the palace area of current king. It's around 3000/- person.- There is a nice collection of local culture galarry inside the palace. - It was a good one."
87,Not worth ,"If you want to get a precious experience... you should go to this amazing palace, built up to protect the old city and the king, it’s a beautiful place to be, walking around, go up sitting in an elephant it’s just amazing"
88, Of the two palaces choose this one if you want to see a bit inside.,"Its a very beautiful place especially with pink colour. The place divided into three part, one the museum, one the palace, and one where the maharaj lived. We can only visit the museum and the palace. At the museum side you can find a lot of historical things from jaipur and…"
89,City palace,"Entry fees is too much ...200 for adult.. keep minimum price all tourist will come ..Nothing to see if see other fort in city ..Palace is ok can see...but if look the price it is not worth for money ...making like mall they doing commercial aspects like mehandi ,book stall....other side irritating guide ...."
90,Ok visit,Very beautiful and interesting. Lots of things to see and appreciate. Tickets seem to be inflated for a museum.
91,Review,Overall I was disappointed I felt for the cost it was not worth it and would have preferred to see other sites which were alot cheaper such as the Amber Fort
92,Beautiful palace but ticket price is exorbitant ,Expensive to visit when there isn't much to see. Probably has to be done but the museums aren't very large and limited in there collections.
93,City palace,"Beautiful Palace with lovely displays. There is a real blokes museum here, the armoury display of all sorts of weapons. I enjoyed that very much and wish we had a bit more time here. Lads, don't miss it. The palm reader outside will look after the missus."
94,No wonder the Raja is still rich,200 ticket price for palace view bit on higher side. worth a visit though. old paintings and attire worn by kings are displayed in mueseum
95,Royal Palace,"The City Palace, in Jaipur is one of the most admired and finest attractions among the places to visit in the Pink City.  City Palace of Jaipur, a must see if you plan to visit the pink city!"
96,Good but not excellant,This palace is big and desrves your time. Do not rush; it is beautiful. There is also a small museum of textiles- costumes from the Maharajah's era - which is very interesting to see. You certainly come away with a good impression of how the Mhaharajah of Rajasthan lived. Well…
97,Different Because it Has The Atmosphere of Being Occupied,The City Palace is worth a visit although it is not as well maintained as some other Palaces in Rajasthan.  Don’t bother with the audio tour as it is incredibly boring and we would not recommend it.  The Palace has such a rich history and you are better off with a live guide.
98,Magnificent architecture,We spent around 2 hours. A historical gem showing past of Rajasthan Rulers. Enjoyed our visit. You can also purchase handicrafts and art effects but the same are a bit costly. entry fee of Rs.200/- per person is on the higher side
99,Personal,"Definite must visit while in Jaipur. And I would actually recommend paying the additional amount to view the special rooms in the palace. Fantastic...the guide comes for free, but be wary of the end of your pitch to buy stuff from the nearby shops - that's one big scam. Otherwise, fab, fab place..."
100,Take the royal tour,"The palace is beautiful. In addition to visit to different parts of the palace, fully guided tour takes tourists to the blue room, room with mirrors and the room where the royals to this day celebrate Diwali, they are all breathtakingly beautiful. The tour ends with a nice cup of tea with biscuits.Take a guided tour and you will not be disappointed !!"
101,Here's a tip,City palace and Jantar mantar are few yards from each other. For Senior wocitizens tickets cost less. The architecture of the palace is superb like any other structure of Rajasthan. This place is well maintained. The guards in traditional dress are always ready to be…
102,Niv,A must see in JaipurI used a great auto service and he became my guide. The street within the city walls is easily walked end to end in 2 hrs
103,Must visit,City Palace is still under Jaipur Royal Family.Advisable to take local guide for palace visit.Royal Guards still continue abt their task incl being photo friendly.Royal Armoury is an interesting display of artefacts.
104,Royal Collection on display,"We got a tuk tuk  from our hotel to the city palace, that’s an experience in its own right. The palace is situated in the middle of the old city wall of Jaipur. It was very busy but enjoyable. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take pictures inside the palace which is a bit of…"
105,A brush with royalty!,Very well designed buildings and architecture. This place is clean but price is a bit too expensive.
106,1500 per person!! ,This place is not suitable to persons with disabilities to visit. Wheelchair users cannot visit as it an inaccessible place. 
107,Still the residence of the Jaipur royals,Very interesting and highly suggest getting a guide. They are quick and to the point and point out things you would never notice. 
108,Scam,"I took a day tour with Royal Majestic Tours booked through Viator.com for USD 75. The guide, Mukesh was excellent and knowledgeable.  He was also an excellent photographer. He provided me with an interesting account of the palace museum and exhibits. We then went into the royal…"
109,Good one,"This palace does not have intricate architecture. But it has an interesting history. It is big, but it did not catch my fancy in comparison to the other Moghul palaces we visited."
110,Amazing architecture - Well Stocked Armory -  Pricey entrance tickets for the seven story visitor palace,"Went there twice. Entrance was INR700/pax exclude private royal quarters. Do visit perhaps towards late afternoon to avoid group tourists as you can take pictures. A living palace with the current Maharajah royal family still reside here. Royal restaurant, an AirBnB Royal Suite…"
111,Amazing Jaipur City Palace,"This is my first trip.The city palace is very nice. You would like this palace, if you are interested in history of kings. Very well designed building. Our guide was knowledgeable ans nice."
112,Super,"Our visit was on April, actually this period is not advisable for visiting Jaipur due to hot whether conditions."
113,City tour,"We first visited Jantar Mantar and then came to City Palace. We were not sure whether to see just the museum or take their Royal Grandeur tour. We decided to take their Royal Grandeur tour which included local guide (English), refreshments, visit to the private rooms of the palace. Mr Manoj Kumar ji was our guide who took us around and was extremely well informed. He has been a local guide since last 40 years. We were amazed to witness the private rooms of the palace which is extremely well kept. Highly recommended everyone to take the Royal Grandeur"
114,Group tour,"A large old palace in the town of Jaipur. There is a lot to see and it takes a couple of hours at least. Well worth a visit, but lots of tourists including many locals."
115,Expensive ticket with guide included ,"the palace is situated at the heart of the city and there are multiple ticket options available to visit the palace , there is a special show in evening but ticket price is higher than the normal ticket price.  you can experience the royal lifestyle at this place."
116,"The splendour tour of city palace, Jaipur","Visited the City Palace of Jaipur on 28th October 2019. Though, I am not big into Palaces and Castles, I was very happy that I made the time and took the effort. Starting from the person in the ticket booking counter to the guide Himmat Singh, the entire experience for, us as a family, a life time experience. Himmat Singh, our guide was well informed of every aspect of the palace as well as the Royal Heritage. He was patient and ensured we enjoyed the tour. Moreover, his photography skills were excellent and he knew where to spend time taking good pictures as my wife is an avid photographer. To see and learn about the Royal Heritage of Jaipur made us fee proud to be an Indian, a country so rich in heritage. Kudos to the Royal family for making it easy for people to experience this.To Himmat Singh - a huge thanks.To the Pink City of Jaipur - Long may your heritage shine to glory .We will be back.Ravi"
117,Awesome place to visit.. also enrich history knowledge,The city palace is close to Tripolia bazar near Jantar Mantar and hence you can part the vehicle in the palace parking area and visit both the places by covering by foot. The city palace is having lot of museums and viewing galleries and if one is interested in history then you can definitely spend much more time here. Otherwise nice to take some photos and have a quick visit to some of the museums inside. The city palace area is big and there is worth exploring around.  One museum on the cavalry and all stuff is pretty good.
118,Absolutely stunning!,"We began our Jaipur sightseeing at the City Palace. It's not as well-known as its Udaipur cousin but grand nonetheless. A buggy is available for visitors, for a fee, to take a round of the campus. The City Palace has many courtyards & buildings. So, don't rush your visit.The Mubarak Mahal facade has a hanging balcony. The carving gives an illusion of a decoupage. All the gates (Pol) have beautiful marble inlay work. The Greek design on the marble floor of the Sarvato Bhadra is eye-catching.The Chandra Mahal is the residence of the royal family. The Peacock Gate in the Pritam Niwas Chowk is outstanding.Hawa Mahal & Jantar Mantar are at a walking distance from the City Palace. Parking is available in the courtyard behind the Naqqar Darwaza. One may feel the tickets are expensive but it's worth it."
119,Amazing experience ,City palace is located in center of Jaipur city in very crowded and heavy traffic area. The local guide is not necessary for this place as most of the things are well explained on board placed next to it. Jantar mantar is just hop across and Hawa Mahal is few minutes walking…
120,Not as good as fort,"Nice palace and good to see the weapon section and also the royal clothes collection. Not so big palace.  Not much to showcase there, but many article shop inside with high prices"
121,The city palace,Historical things and stories are very informative as well as amusing. Guides are very helpful in exploring the charm of this beautiful museum.
122,"Grand, well maintained and well curated. ","Amazing what you can see, experience and learn here. Don't forget the wapen's room and have info on some of the pieces. Take your time to stroll around!"
123,Very high priced. ,Nothing special about the city palace. Entry fee of Rs. 200 is too high. Only some portion of city palace is available for tourists.
124,Maybe a little overrated but well worth the visit ,The staff at the gate pushed a price list and recommended a half palace tour wich was very expensive and was not worth it at all. We didnt realy enter the palace and the nice things to see are included in the much cheaper ticket. The guide was nice.
125,One of the beautiful mahal in jaipur,The City Palace in Jaipur is an exciting place to spend a couple of hours watching some of the historic artifacts and buy some authentic pieces of handicraft and fabric. It is very important to get a good guide in order to understand everything. One can even get inside the…
126,The whole place is a royal scam by a corrupt family ,"The management tries to charge a lot for entry. Buy the cheapest ticket and take a stroll. The silver vessels are interesting, nothing too special here. Spend your time shopping or eating!"
127,Impressive,"The palace is worth a visit if you want to have a look into what an actual Indian palace looks like, however a guide is included in the expensive entrance fee and he makes sure that tourists don’t want off to restricted areas. "
128,Commercial palace ,Visited here and really liked it. Plenty to see. Lovely architecture. Plenty of history attached to the place. It has the two biggest solid silver bowls on earth. This place is well worth a visit.
129,A mixed bag,Must visit place if in jaipur.Home for erstwhile royalty. Granduer palpable.Rich heritage .Antique worth watching.
130,Heart of royality and history in the city,"Good, but ticket is costly,not worth the 200rs.that we give.the guards don't give you any info.the guide is ok."
131,good for a couple of hours..!,This is one of the best city palace I have visited so far what a collection of arms and ammunition. Very well maintains property
132,Does Not Belong to the City,"We friends visited city palace with our kids. Entry for an adult is 200rs and kids up to age 6 are free to enter,after that they are also charged.palace have different sections to see, like museum where old costumes, weapons etc are kept, dabar Hall where king and people use to…"
133,Nice for a quick view of museums,"There is a baggi (horse carriage) to take you around the palace, at an extra cost. Its a good premises with grand doorway & has good collection of items used by the Royal family, who still occupies part of palace. We could take few pics by professionals inside the museum & shop sitting on the Chair with Swords and Turban too, but it was to be paid extra, not included in the entry fees.  They had well built & uniformed gatekeepers with big mustaches manning the side gates and willing to get clicked on request.  The Charm of the place is well maintained."
134,Beautiful,"The Palace was not that far from the Amber Fort. By bus it was about 10 minutes to reach the place from Amber Fort. We just look/ walk around the compound of the Palace. Nothing much to see. We went to a nearby museum. Not a big museum, within 10 minutes you can finish looking at the pictures of the previous rulers. It’s only one level  and you are not allowed to take pictures inside the museum. The visit to City Palace wasn’t that interesting."
135,Don’t even bother coming here!,Well worth a visit to this awesome museum palace. The palace and its many artifacts give visitors insight as to how the Royals of this palace lived.
136,can be skipped,Impressive structure and grounds latest Maharaja and still used by the existing royal family. Visit when combined with Royal observatory
137,"AN AVOIDABLE TOURIST ATTRACTION IN jAIPUR , iNDIA","When in Jaipur, I recommend that you use a guided tour so you don’t miss out on any of the attractions, there is so much to see in the Pink City. This palace was stunning, well maintained and the stories our guide told us about this was so interesting. It was really crowded when…"
138,Not so appealing,It's a beautiful palace and well managed. The tickets aren't expensive and one can roam around freely without the guides being too pushy. Awesome places to click pictures.
139,Over hyped not worth it,Not worth the entry price. Nothing special about it. Cannot enter the Palace without paying 3500 rupees
140,Quite good,"While the entry fee is a little high, the knowledge you gain from the guides is truly amazing. The city palace is home to the royal family however most of the sections are open to public and you can get some real good pictures with the beautiful interiors here! The expanse that…"
141,Brief visit but we loved the textile area of the museum..,There are 3 different entrance tickets to the city palace. Only two are including the entrance to the real palace building. We decided to go with the 2000 rupees splendour tour and it was totally worth its money. Away from the crowd the tour was inside the building where we were able to see some of the royal rooms. The tour time was about 2 hours and the guide was very well known of the regional history and culture. He was very open to all our questions and we enjoyed our stay a lot. We can totally recommend the guide Gajendra Haripura.
142,City Palace of Jaipur - Must visit place.,"No doubt the beauty of palace have inspire every tourist with awe. However, despite its beauty in art, culture, history . The current  price for entering certain sections of the palace are too expensive and limits the tourists ."
143,Beautiful city palace ,"We visited in Feb 27 afternoon.There was a ticket in the entereence.Here they kept dresses,used things, painting of Maharajas.The palace was too big. We roamed here.Everywhere shopping .You will because mad about things n you will buy all.The palace is in the city."
144,Fabulous building and rich exhibits,"Home of king sawai maharajas , must visit to see the wall painting and glass work of roof. Also u can enjoy the panoramic view of jaipur from the fort."
145,"At 700rs, save your money. Disappointing.","Visited ""The Golden Triangle"" recently. The City Palace of Jaipur was well worth a visit,  stunning building so well crafted all those years ago. After every step was another view and wow factor. Well worth a visit but would suggest go with a guide or read up all about it before…"
146,City Palace,Breathtaking place. Fantastic views. Every corner plenty of history. Amazing architectures.A beautiful arms exhibition.No photo allowed.
147,Must visit place for 1 hr max 😁,"I wish I had more time to expend on this place, remarkable decoration, history and cultural signs, the best were the private rooms. You need to pay extra but it wort it, our private guide @VirendraSR did an amazing job with this tour."
148,A giant Palace,This palace complex  is located in the hear of Jaipur and morning is the best time to visit as it get crowded towards the later part of the day.There are two sections to the palace and the first section entry is only INR 200 and the other more beautiful section requires seperate fee of INR 3500 as it is partly occupied by the royal family and entry restrictedThere are three palaces in jaipur two of which are repurposed to five star hotels 1)City palace2)Jai Mahal palace Hotel3) Rambagh palace HotelThere is also a photography point at the entrance which i found quite interesting as you can wear the tradition rajasthani headgear and click couple of photos and then pick it up while leaving the premises.A good restaurant and couple of gift shops are also inside the city palace .Noteworthy is the famous peacock doors and few other photography points within the premises  and the visit could take  one to two hours
149,Pink Palace,Its nice place to visit. Our guide very good and helpful. He give me lots of information about city place also we enjoyed museum in side.
150,they made as a business way,"I have been just palace, temple or building'd out by the time we stopped here on my tour, but I could have skipped it.  That also played into our decision to just do the ""composite"" tour.  While we enjoyed our brief visit there it just wasn't really what we were in the mood for…"
151,Still the Royal Palace.,This is a lovely place to wander around for the morning. We didn’t bother with a guide just used the audio equipment which was available when we brought our tickets. The armoury was particularly interesting as where the courtyards. Please note you are only allowed to take photos outside of the buildings.
152,The city palace is a must visit in Jaipur,Showcasing the history of the Jaipur maharajas. Entry fee varying from 200 to visit the museum to 3000 for a tour of the private rooms inside the palace. Advisable to take a guide along or at least an audio guide to know the full history and stories behind the place. The only negative is the that the best bits are not allowed to be photographed.
153,Definitely need a guide.,A huge palace in the Jaipur city. A guide gives you a good amount of detail on the palace. But you can still visit the palace without a guide. A small puppet shop is located near the exit of the palace. They perform on request. Try it if you are interested.
154,Exprisnce ,We visited this palace as part of a tour group and got to see some of the sites (e.g. the textile and weapon museums).  We didn't get to spend a lot of time visiting and I know there are other areas to visit as well.  Probably best done not as part of a tour group other than a…
155,There are better places in Jaipur,For the price which they charge from the tourists is exhorbitant and not  value for money. A good collection of royal treasures but poor exhibition needs to be revamped. For the amount of tickets they should an art gallery to exhibit the best collection of original paintings of jaipur and moughal paitings. THE SILEH KHANA IS CLOSED PLACE AND VERY VERY HOT TO VISIT.tHIS COLLECTION ON GROUND FLOOR.
156,Memorable,"I had visited City palace years ago. And visited now this September. I was shocked to see how many shops, restaurant, bar etc are opened in this premises. The whole thing is reduced to one tiny building.I wonder why they charge do much entry fee, if one has to see written, "" Private"" every where."
157,Breathtaking Palace.,The palace building is fabulous. The very rich exhibits inside are fabulous - such extravagance.  No photography allowed inside and the guards are very strict - they made sure visitors deleted photos taken inside.
158,Fabulous Visit ,"likes :plenty of spaces to walk around clean toiletsthe court rooms and historic pieces of art are well maintainedneat little cafeteriadislikes:expensive for what u pay(don bother paying extra for the royal rooms/interior visit)bottom linegood to spend a couple of hours .,may be little more if ur into history"
159,Extremely overpriced,Firstly you have to be very cautious in terms of buying the tickets. There are two options: firstly ticket only for museum which is close to 400 INR and second for the palace which is worth 1500 INR. We were confused because the online rates for tickets were much lower. We …
160,Beautiful but underwhelming,"Felt the 700inr entrance was quite expensive for the level of access it provided, although there were some interesting things to see, like the largest silver objects in the world for instance. However, this one definitely had the 'tourist trap' feel to me though."
161,Beautiful,"Again similar in lay out to amber fort, but architecture different. Again take your time and take it in,take water with you."
162,Interesting,It is called “that” but this is privately owned by the last ruler of the city before India got its independence. The rich owners have their family being educated in London and all their family are still living in the compound. There is nothing wrong with that. It is good that they are paying their taxes and have a place for tourists to visit. There is definitely story to the history and is worth a visit. There is a charge of course.
163,A glimpse into the royal life at Jaipur.,"We loved this place - great museums in the old palace rooms of arms, costumes and more. Huge silver urns for the water the Maharajah took to England with him - didn't trust foreign water! Lovely ornate doors. Huge durbar hall where the Mountbattens were enthroned. Fascinating…"
164,Jaipur City Palace,"Another Must visit place on the list of prominent attractions in the beautiful city of Jaipur. The decorated  interiors, the well preserved garments of the maharajas, the arms of the times are all a must see!"
165,Excellent visit,A visit to the Royal Palace is a mixture of a couple of museums related to the former royal family and the opportunity to see some excellent palace buildings which are very well maintained.
166,Understanding Rajasthan royalty,There is no need to go here. All the shops sell the same trash as on the street and they are 700 rupees cheaper. It’s honestly one large excuse to sponge another rupee out of unwitting tourists. There is a couple silver bowls and 4 doors that’s all..The 3500 tour is of the actual palace but on the surface may only have 10 or 20 shops so may not be worth it.It’s a commercial operation like a large shopping mall dressed up as history. Walking the streets is far more fun
167,Rajasthani Grandeur,"We had a guide show us around. Only 400 rupees. Very interesting and the guide was brilliant. Very enthusiastic, really loves his job. Beautiful place to visit."
168,Too expensive ,Beautifully maintained palace. Excellent guides and information services. Restaurant and coffee shop serves a range of dishes that will suit most palettes.
169,Royal Palace,If you are a history buff and love to go back in time and learn about the vibrant history of Jaipur then the City Palace is a must visit. There is a museum inside as well with the artefacts of the royal family from years gone by. I really like the architecture of the buildings. Guides are not that knowledgable but if you are in Jaipur this is one of the things one should do.
170,Underwhelming and overpriced,The visit to the City Palace was nice. The palace has the details of the princely activities of previous Royal family of Jaipur. The palace is a good tourist place.
171,Nice looking palace but damn expensive,"Very disappointing place: the architecture is a mixture of pseudo Mughal style, all walls have painted decoration in ""trompe l oeil"", the inside of building are poorly lit and areas are cordoned off. In comparison with other palaces in India, this is a theatrical replica...Lonely planet has completely missed the point here: there's no superb collection of costumes and shawls, it's dusty, poorly lit and truly unispiring.The armoury had half of its display behind bars over the door, almost impossible to see anything.Don't be conned to buy the""grandeur tours"" for 3500 rupees, it's not worth it!"
172,Private Tour with Gajendra,A place you must visit. You will see how strong Rajapuths were and how they lived and Ruled. Janthar manthar is also magnificent.and indicates how the ancient Rulers were font of science
173,A must,"I’ve given this 3 rather than 2 stars because there were actually good things to see in the palace, as well as it being quite pretty. My reason for marking down are that for the price it is expensive/poor value for money, especially compared to udaipur’s city palace which is…"
174,Thieves......,"We had a short amount of time in Jaipur and wish we didn’t use any of it here. I found it overpriced and just got bothered by workers for photos and tips the whole time. The famous peacock gate etc are good for a picture, but the pictures we got at Amber Fort and other places in…"
175,Must Visit in night,It's the palace of the royal family of Jaipur. Current royal family also staying near the palace. You can see and know about the rulers and there favourite possessions. It's having paid entrance.
176,Don’t pay for Royal Residence,Amazing visit to the Palace!! One of the most well kept palaces in our country. We had taken the Royal Grandeur Tour which costs rs. 3000 per person for an Indian tourist which let's you see the inner palace where the royal family still resides with a guide to explain you all…
177,Incredible experience with a guide,"Magnificent views of Royal past. Easy access from city. Tickets are priced at Rs. 1500/-., which seems costly."
178,Well maintained palace with museum,It is important to see all these special places in Jaipur.  History and legacy....great artistry in the workmanship.
179,Puppet show,Get the guide for the tour!! Our guide was knowledgeable and nice. He explained the history and showed us the important highlights. My favorite part of the tour was stopping at the little charity table. The princess has a charity where the proceeds go to the betterment of women…
180,VISIT TO CITY OF PALACE OF JAIPUR- A GREAT EXPERIENCE,A pleasant place with some history and interesting artefacts being the artillery room and room where Mountbatten met the Raja.
181,Interesting Palace,"Disgusting thieves manage by a bunch of old farts, corrupted. They charge you 700 and then to see the palace inside they order you to pay and extra 3500. Nothing worth watching. Save your money!"
182,City Palace,"I visited City Palace in Jaipur recently , after a gap of about 12 years, and was totally disappointed. The plus point of this tourist attraction is that , in the Old City , it is the only place where adequate parking is available.That is about the only plus. The price of…"
183,Jaipur diaries,"Visited City Palace with my wife, a wonderful experience most beautiful architecture stunning decor and furnishings. This visit was made for us by our guide Gajendra Singh who made the whole thing come alive with the history and detail of the Palace. For anybody visiting Jaipur…"
184,Grand palace ,"The City Palace is definitely worth seeing.  While there, do not miss seeing the incredible Astronomical Observatory next door -  try to find a guide to explain it to you.    Ideally, one should see it when the sun is out, not when it is raining.  It is truly incredible!"
185,Interesting couple of hours,"We lucked out and got a wonderful tour guide at the palace (they go on a rotation basis). He really made the tour worthwhile. We did the full tour and paid the higher price for that. Going in the mid-afternoon helped avoid the crowds. It's definitely not as impressive as Mysore Palace (largest in India) or Udaipur City Palace, but there are many beautiful rooms and courtyards.  Buyer beware: the gift shops in the palace are expensive and you'd do better in the city markets. I succumbed when I should have known better! We did enjoy meeting the artists, however, and left with a lovely painting. Overall we had a fun visit."
186,Interesting,"As Jaipur was only the city we visited in the state of Rajasthan and City Palace was the only palace in Jaipur, we paid the exorbitant ticket price of INR3,500 per person. There are other tickets sold at a lower price range but we read about the beautiful blue room in the palace…"
187,Stunning buildings,"We paid the full 3,500 Rupee to see the palace rooms. Ouch!We could see on arriving that the palace was quite small but decided to pay the extortionate price on our guides recommendation. The 3,500 gives you a view of the city from the 5th floor, 2 very pretty but furnitureless rooms and a cup of tea. I feel we were fleeced, and can’t recommend it except to those with money to spare, but give this review a 2nd star as the 2 rooms were very nice, so setting aside the cost we enjoyed our visit.. Even at 1,000 rupee a ticket I would have given a far more generous score.I can only suppose that the high price is to keep the numbers of tourists walking through the palace to a minimum, as it is still the home of the royal family. The high price achieves this as we had the palace almost to ourselves, so were at liberty to take photos in our own time and to imagine the lives of royals in years past."
188,Beautiful architecture ,"We had a fabulous guide for our visit, booked at the palace.  Stunning architecture, art and relics.  Very beautiful and interesting."
189,Boring Audio Tour,"Loved this Building from the minute you enter through the Tripolia Gate, walking through a small variety of shops and then through the beautiful Virendra Pol flanked by carved elephants you come across the arched and colonnaded Murbarak Mahal which houses a lovely display of clothing worn by Royalty of the Mogul era. Stop of a lovely lunch in the shade of parasols at the newly opened Palace Cafe. Wonder around the hall where beautiful paintings are sold and then back through Virendra Pol to see the beautiful pink and white open courtyard displaying two huge silver urns. At the rear of the palace is another large courtyard where the ladies used to dance and this is flanked by four magnificent gates representing the season’s. Behind this courtyard you can see the Chandra Mahal where the Royal Family still live"
190,Underwhelming ,The City Palace of Jaipur is gorgeous and it’s been very well maintained. I much preferred it to the one in Udaipur. It’s definitely worth a visit and it’s nice to stroll through and imbibe the deep heritage of Rajasthan!
191,Attended Sawai Jaipur Award Distribution Function,"Situated in the old city walls of Jaipur the city palace entrance is a little obscure being on a side street.Built between 1729 - 1732 the architecture is stunning,there are several courtyards and gardens,one attraction not to miss is the peacock door .There are several guards…"
192,Brilliant Day Jai,Absolutely beautiful! The City Palace forms one of the most famous tourist attractions in Jaipur. They open at 9.30 so make sure you come early to avoid the crowds!
193,Amazing palace ,"City Palace is located just 5 minutes walking distance away from Jantar Mantar (another popular attraction). The ticket rates differ based on the tour that you choose. A guide accompanies you for the expensive tours. I had chosen the tour which cost INR 1500/-. I was very happy with my guide - Mr. Dileep Singh. He patiently showed me the palace, answered all my questions and clicked my photos whenever I requested him to. He gave me time to enjoy the views from the palace too. Choose the tour based on your budget and the purpose of your visit. If your aim is to capture attractive shots then you can choose the expensive tours. If you just wish to get historical information then the cheaper tour makes sense.Before you decide to buy the ticket, a guide gives you the information as to what does each tour consist of. I have read many reviews here which report this attraction as scam or too expensive. Personally, I don't feel there is any scam involved here. The royal family still resides in this palace. That probably could be one of the reasons for the high price. When the king is present, certain sections are closed for the general public. INR 1500/-  tour included tea and refreshments too which were good. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was fascinated to hear the stories, understand the architecture and enjoy the views of Jaipur.It took me approximately 1.5hrs to complete it. There is an elevator inside and a ramp too which makes it comfortable. There are some shops located inside the palace. From my research and experience, they are expensive. However, I was unable to find that quality outside in other bazaars. I went back on the next day and purchased a quilt from here which is the softest I have experienced so far. I am happy with my purchase. Again, think about your budget before you spend here.On a side note, the Sheesh Mahal at Nahargarh Fort and Amber Fort is much better than the one here."
194,Its worth your money!!,"Well worth a visit.  Not only is it an Indian Palace (another one!), but it is claimed still to be occupied in parts and at times.  There is a lot of family history on display in the museums.  There is a choice of eating places on hand as well.  Not too crowded and you can find your own space."
195,Splendour Tour - Worth its money - including an excellent guide,Thy pretend it to b super wow insid..n nw thy charge 1500 for visitin half palace (inside) and 3000 for full palace visit.. its too costly. 
196,Jaipur trip,"We enjoyed the City Palace in Jaipur.The palace is beautiful, the Peacock gate is stunning just as expected, as are the other three gates, there are lots of other amazing things to see. We thought the Diwan E Khas was spectacular with chandeliers and two of the biggest silver urns ever made.Be careful, we paid for a guide as we arrived late and wanted in particular to see the Peacock gate, the guide suggested that the palace was soon to close and we would have trouble finding the gate.Although he was informative, we could have found the gate easily and he took too long in parts and was basically bossy."
197,Good historical intraction,We visited this place as part of our G Adventure guided tour. We were briefed in various sections of this palace. It was not crowded so we had enough time to view the entire place. Worth visiting.
198,City Palace - reflection of India and Jaipur’s splendour,Nice and beautiful place Jaipur is very famous because of old pink city. People are so friendly and City palace beautiful palace old handicraft. Museum story of king amazing..
199,Composite ticket with audio was perfect for us,"This was by far the most expensive entrance fee for any tourist place we have visited in India. We paid INR3,500 which included a tour guide but he was not a very good tour guide at all. At the end of our tour he basically forced us to see the pashmina shop but we said we weren't interested but he insisted we take a look! Of course after taking a look they try their best sales technique to get us to buy a pashmina! It's too commercialised... they shouldn't do this!"
200,Visit to the City Palace,"The City Palace is the home to the Rajasthan royal family, now having ceremonial or historical relevance only but very much still engaged in the development of the state. Best to go early in the day to avoid both crowds and heat.  The City Palace is an impressive museum, in what…"
201,Lovely Visit,"The entrance ticket for the splendour tour for tourists  may sound exorbitant,at 3500inr but it is definitely worth doing. I took my time and spent two and half hours at this palace. The architecture , a blend of mughal and rajesthani ,boasts of grandeur and opulence . My…"
202,Part of tour of Jaipur with Nikita Travel ,"At the heart of the Pink City stands the magnificent City Palace, it is one of the most beautiful palaces in the whole world. You need half a day to explore the palace and admire its beauty."
203,Awesome experience.,Well worth going early. We got there when it opened and so glad we did as we managed to take photos and see the most important areas before it became very crowded. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photos in the throne room as this room is quite spectacular and gives the history of the maharajah’s through the centuries.The architecture is stunning throughout and their is also a small museum which is fascinating.It is still the grand residence of the Indian Royal family.Well worth a visit but strongly suggest you go with a professional guide.
204,Another must see in Jaipur,"We enjoyed the idea of living here. I would have been wonderful.The Rulers of Jaipur still do stay in part of it and who can blame them, The whole complex would have been very impressive to a visitor as it is today even to experience travelers."
205,Bit pricey ....,"We opted for the “Composite ticket” with audio, which allowed access to all the palace courts, the museum, painting and photos exhibit (amazing), arms room, ... but not the Chandra Mahal. We wouldn’t have had time to do that too today, so the Composite option was perfect for us. We spent 2 hours in the painting and photographic exhibit itself! I’d recommend researching the ticket options in advance to help you decide what you have time for or not.It’s not so clear when you are there."
206,Pretty palace in Jaipur,I loved slowly wandering around the rooms and alleyways of this palace complex but I found the cost of entering the palace itself a little steep. Happy to just view the architecture surrounding it.
207,Overpriced,To me not worth a visit. I don't see what the fuss is about this building. Rather spend time in the market near-by 
208,Behind the Scenes Insiders Tip,The palace was the royal residence. There is a private palace where the current descendants still live. 4 gates depicting 4 seasons are masterpieces
209,"Looks impressive, but so so inside",A popular tourist attraction if visiting Jaipur for the first time. The Maharaja reigned from this impressive city palace.One of the  highlights for me were the 4 gates that represented the seasons. Location: Center of old town
210,Pride of the City!,"Ridiculous prices for tourists and there's nothing to see except an empty courtyard unless you want to pay £30 to get inside.Annoying sellers too,"
211,astonishing museum,"We got suckered into paying the 3500 rupees per head for the ‘grand tour’.  Some nice stuff, no doubt but hardly worth the money.  I would have paid 1000 rupees top.  This is a private palace, not associated with the city at all.  Essentially this place is a money making racket for the royal family.  Oh, and be aware that your guide will get a kick back.  Skip."
212,"Kitsch,uncurated,tourist trap","Touring the Jaipur City Palace was an optional tour of our tour group.  We chose to attend all of the optional tours (except the dinners) because we might not attend those cities / sites again in the future.  We are not disappointed with the City Palace, however, we did not pay extra to see the extra rooms and halls (as mentioned by other reviewers).  Based on what we saw from the outside of the buildings, we were quite amazed about the ancient architecture.  It is a must-see in Jaipur."
213,Very good ,"I found the interior, with its magnificent architecture, most impressive. There are many beautiful paintings, weapons of war, and many other artifacts. Well worth visiting."
214,"In comparison, don’t bother ","We had visited the Royal Palace outside areas a few years ago and enjoyed it immensely. Yesterday, we decided to pay the 7,000 indian rupees EACH to see the interior of the Royal Palace where guests reside if Jaipur is entertaining. If there are guests, this $138 tour for two…"
215,Main palace of Jaipur,"Our guide convinced us to buy the 3500 rupees ticket by saying it would be totally worth it. With this ticket you can enter a private part of the palace (in which you cannot even take photos) and in a couple of decorated rooms. Nice rooms, but nothing new if you have already visited other forts or palaces in Rajasthan. The tour is very short and disappointing. You will come out with a couple of nice photos and that's it. We felt like we had just thrown 7000 rupees in the trash bin. We even felt disappointed with our guide, he must have had some good friend inside the ticket office. It's just a crazy price and I can't believe we wasted so much money like this! I am publishing the photos of the 3 rooms so you don't have to spend 3500 rupees to see them."
216,Morning visit- fabulous ,"This palace is a reflection of all the grandeur of the Maharajas who ruled from here. The museum has a lovely, lifelike portraits of the various Maharajas. The open courtyard with doorways in various hues of peacock colours is a beautiful sight and provides a brand view of the…"
217,Okay,This is a very fine palace in the heart of the city. I had approx 2.5  hours to spend here as per my itinerary so visited only the larger portion covered in entry ticket and plan to skip the Chandra Mahal (it has a separate and very costly ticket) The audio guide is a must while walking around the palace otherwise it is just a fantasy. The audio guide is available at the ticket counter and can also be taken on your cell phone (use captiva tour app) Both the audio guides are exactly the same. Use the entrance from Jantar Mantar side as after visiting the palace you can immediately walk to Jantar Mantar.
218,Beautiful,There was a group of middle age children dancing & singing on an outdoor stage when we 1st went in. They had a lot of chairs set up outside & we right away found a seat in the front. A boy played a guitar  & they had a keyboard off to the side. It was an enjoyable dancing  performance. Then we explored the beautiful palace. There were some ladies doing henna for a reasonable charge & we had our hands done in very pretty patterns that we both got to choose. We walked up to the top & the view was spectacular. I highly recommend seeing the palace.
219,City Palace ,"The city palace is supposedly the seat of the royalty of Jaipur however more than the palace itself, the artefacts placed inside give us a taste of royalty. Some of these artefacts include the weaponry, clothing, giant containers of water and the interesting stories behind these. However, the architecture is not impressive and since I visited this place at night, the lighting salvaged the otherwise mundane architecture of the palace. Please do not buy tickets for the light and sound show, you might as well go to the throne room and switch on the audioguide for each of the painting framed there. Sadly the most alluring part of the palace was the possibility of running into the current heirs of the royal family who did not live very far from the actual palace."
220,Well designed palace ,Certainly an impressive place to visit - but to fully appreciate it you do need a guide. Quite interesting to think it had been used up until - relatively - recently.  The museum and armoury are well worth a visit.
221,Not worth the visit,"My husband and I visited the Palace yesterday and yes, it was QUITE nice BUT the entry fee was WAY OVER THE TOP...We paid by Credit Card and later, back at our Hotel, we were amazed at how much we actually were charged... INR 7,000 for both of us and this didn't include the museum. This is around Aust $145.00 for both of us, or Aust$72.50 pp... No wonder they throw in a FREE drink and a book at the end. No photos allowed inside... Just another tourist rip-off!"
222,Beautiful Palace,"Tourist trap and scam.I’d planned to book online through their website, it clearly listed prices and showed foreign seniors as ‘free’, however my internet was sporadic and I just decided to pay at the gate.  When we arrived we were told the government website was wrong and their was no senior discount. I showed the website, and the counter attended was plain rude, said it wasn’t the official site even when other staff pointed out it was. Paid a lot of money as foreigners for what is essentially a run down courtyard with a few interesting artefacts.  Too many pushy sales people. Not enough signage, could use more ‘then and now’ photos to give the attraction ambience.Wasn’t prepared to pay £30+ per person to see the better rooms, I’m not convinced it would be worth it."
223,Photojournalist,"The City Palace, in Jaipur is one of the finest attractions in the Pink City.The palace complex is in the heart of Jaipur city.The palace complex has several buildings, various courtyards, galleries, restaurants, and offices. It has everything. You can enjoy the rajasthani…"
224,Splendour City palace tour-Beautiful blue room,"My friends and I visited during our recent trip to Jaipur and while the museums were interesting, it wasn't our favorite thing. There were beautiful sections and rooms, but we wished we could've seen more."
225,Nice visit for a morning ,We had a very nice tour with Gajendra. Very much informations and a very symaphic manner of presenting everything. Was great! Thank you
226,Such a beautiful place in Jaipur,Enjoyed the visit. Rain did alter our plans however we had a great visit . it was great to spend time looking at various attractions inside. excellent weaponary etc.
227,Lots of Interesting Stories,The art and architecture of this building shows through by day but the night show gives it a new radiance. A breathtaking experience that will leave you speechless.
228,Tour group activity,"Nice and interesting visit. Not as amazing as the Udaipur city palace in my opinion, but definitely worth a visit. Also, it is still a residence of the current prince."
229,Normal,One of the best museum I have ever seen in my life. What a collection of guns & swords they have. This is residence of Jaipur king also
230,It has so much to say about Rajputana,"We loved Jaipur but felt very ripped off by this place. We paid 20,000 rupee each and had to have a guide to wonder around a couple of rooms and then visit 3 shops.  I would never go again and since it was twice as much as the Taj Mahal represented really poor value."
231,Half palace tour disappointing,"We spent an interesting hour or so wandering through the courtyards and museums of the palace.  It is still lived in and the one large and one small flags signified that royalty was in residence.  Historic paintings showing the lineage, along with polo artifacts and a number of…"
232,Abode to a lot of royalty!,"It’s gorgeous inside, especially Pritam Niwas Chowk with its ornamented gates (including the one from the Lonely Planet cover), but at Rs 700 for foreigners, I’m not sure it’s worth it. I also visited Amer Fort (Rs 500) and Hawa Mahal (Rs 200), and City Palace was definitely the least impressive of the three—but cost just as much as the other two combined. If you’re on a tight budget, just skip it in favor of the other amazing sites in Jaipur."
233,City palace,"Way over priced in my opinion. 700 rupees for the cheapest ticket and going up to 3500!! It was just another palace area to look around. We couldn't enter many of the rooms with our ticket. They have an art workshop in one area where the man was very rude to us because we didn't want to join in, but just wanted to watch him."
234,City Palace,"Sadly as soon as they saw me they refused to sell me the advertised foreigner ticket of 700 and demanded 2000. My Indian partner was asked for 200, however when they saw me with him the increased it. Unwilling to accept such racism we left. Of all the places we have traveled in India this is the most racist."
235,Beautiful palace in the heart of the city,"Came away feeling distinctly under whelmed from the City Palace. The guide we picked up inside was good value for 300 rupees, but he was the only thing that was. For 700 rupees there just isnt much to see. They try and upsell you to 3500R for the tour of the private rooms....are they mad?You see a few nice courtyards, a series of overcrowded rooms which need some TLC and better signage and then you get taken into a 'demonstration of the unique painting style' i.e shop of paintings, and also a hard sell of pashminas in another 'demonstration'. No wonder the Maharajs can afford their current lifestyle of playing polo around the world with the prices they are charging foreigners. This one felt all about the cash at every stage."
236,At the heart of Jaipur,"We enjoyed our time at City Palace.   The historical artifacts housed there do a great job of telling the history of the area.  There are people dressed up in historical attire that are more than willing to take pictures with you, but they don't do it for free, they want a tip."
237,Beautiful palace,We visited the Royal Palace in February 2020. We had with us a private guide that we had employed from the U.K. ( we had a private guide in each city arranged by our Indian agent). At Delhi and Agra our guides ensured that we got our tickets for attractions and were well looked…
238,Not worth the visit,1000% must visit palace jaipur. City palace is also residence of royal family of jaipur and is one of best maintained palace you will ever visit. All the weapons and cloths used by the royal kings are preserved here. Architecture of city palace is beyond belief. Do hire a…
239,Visiting with the Royals,"Of course, every palace in India has its own charm, and is of interest, BUT ... in this case, the cost of visiting is unreasonably high. Are you sure you want to visit the palace?"
240,A bit disappointing,"A very expensive entrance fee, compared to other places of interest . Worth going to see with a guide. We went early to avoid the crowds. I found the guest suite fascinating with British Royal memorabilia.20,000 entrance was too much, compared to what we experienced at the…"
241,Nice palace,"We were at wedding reception at this wonderful palace. On arrival we were greeted with amazing dancers, horses, camels and elephants. After a champagne arrival drink we were treated to a short film about the story of pink palace. The meal was excellent in open air surroundings. "
242,Poor value for money,"My wife and I visited the City Palace as part of a Golden Triangle tour with the TripaDeal group in February.  Our guide explained all the history of this palace, now the former residence of the Royal family. You could just picture the day to day life of the King all those years…"
243,Beautiful Architecture and ambience,"Hoards of tourists came into the buildings and every Insta princess in Asia seemed to be there posing selfishly for entire epochs in front of the highlights.  It's expensive to visit as a ""foreigner"".  There are three rooms with things you can see, textiles, the arsenal and the…"
244,Must see place ,"Another beautiful palace in Rajasthan. Best part is near the palace’s inner courtyard - Pitam Niwas Chowk. Here four intricately designed gates represent the seasons – the Peacock Gate depicts autumn, the Lotus Gate - summer, the Green Gate - spring, and the Rose Gate - winter. "
245,Commercialization killed it's charm.,"When paying for your ticket do NOT give them your credit card.  Pay in cash.  This was the only time this card was used, and that evening 3 fraudulent charges were made.  An employee of this place took advantage of the fact that you can not see inside of the ticket window very well.  The card had to be cancelled, and I am now without it for the rest of my trip."
246,Overpriced for foreigners,"In a city with so much to see the City Palace was a bit of a disappointment, basically only two courtyards unless you pay an extra 3,500 to see the private rooms. The palace is not included in the ticket that allows you to visit a number of sites in two days. Although 700 rupees…"
247,Excellent Museum,Very well preserved palace gives an insight into the opulence enjoyed by the Maharajas of Jaipur. Well worth a visit.
248,It’s 700 to go shopping don’t waste your cash ,"We arrived at the entrance. We were met by a guy telling us about the types of tours. He was a guide, which I usually don’t like the upsell. However, he pointed out that the full tour (most expensive) took you into the private palace and to the upper rooms. So I said what the heck. He joined us and gave us the grand tour. Some of the best money i spent in India. We had a private behind the scenes tour without any crowds. We got to the top of the palace and went through the rooms. We went out on the balconies for the best views in Jaipur. Then we were treated to high tea. Once back down we saw all the other tourists and the crowds. Take the behind the scenes tour. You won’t regret it."
249,Jaipur ki Shaan.,The City Palace is located in middle of the city market and is near Hawa Mahal. The door inside the City Palace is very Photographic and beautiful.
250,Personal tour,"A museum well worth visiting. While we were there, a group of ladies were dancing in the square and students were playing music throughout the museum. There are many interesting, cultural things to see."
251,Nice palace in history,Thanks to our guide Jai for an amazing day in Jaipur. We experienced sights that we would not have seen without him. Highly recommend his tour and thoroughly enjoyed the day. Thank you Jai.
252,Go back in time,"If you want to pay way over the odds to see how a very rich family live, how all their ancestors were terribly wealthy and a few random pictures of Prince Charlie go for this place. My advice save your money on this one, cross the road and check out Jantar Mantar the 400 year old Science Park 100 times more interesting and 100 times cheaper. For 2 adults and one child cost us £100.....its cheaper to join the National Trust. Avoid"
253,Highlight of our trip!,"India is full of magnificent monuments. The City Palace is yet another attraction that is breathtaking.  Yes, it is costly, it seems that if you are a foreigner, price gouging is part of the norm, but we figured that we would never be returning so we should see as much as possible.The Maharaja's knew how to build, and knew how to live.  This palace is spectacular. Take the time to look around and enjoy the beauty of the architecture of this palace."
254,Nice place.,"This is a well maintained palace by erstwhile royal family of Jaipur. It has exhibitions of royal clothes, weapons, diwan-e-aam and diwan-e-khas. There are beautiful gates which are called pol in local language. Diwan-e-aam is particularly impressive. Also you see world’s biggest silver vessel. Unfortunately cameras are not allowed inside museumsYou take about an hour to visit. Tourist Guide is available but not required. Be aware of shopping trap."
255,Nice palace with lot of history and displays.,"The city palace is an amazing collection of various courtyards from basic gathering places to intricately detailed works of art.  The inlay work of mirrors and other semi-precious stones was beautiful.  Be sure not to miss the huge silver urns that were once used to carry water, they are over 5 feet tall and reportedly the largest silver vessel's in the world."
256,Thieves,We spent probably around 2.5 hours there with a guy that charged us 500 rupees to explain us the whole thing (we were 10 people).There are cool things to know but others are just meh. Overall quite nice stop
257,Very expensive (by Indian standards) for not alot,"It was alright, we walked around by ourselves.  I would not say it was worth it as I was expecting it to be in better condition than what it was."
258,Entry is exorbitantly priced,"I visited the city palace of Jaipur one month ago for the first time. It was built by  maharaja Swai Jai Singh II. There is a clock tower, peacock gate, clothes and weapons gallery where we can see a lots old weapons."
259,Rip Off,"Our tour only went on the grounds, and not inside the Palace.  Given that perspective, the palace is architecturally interesting, but not as interesting as many of the sites througout india.  There is a museum, an art bazaar (the most interesting) and many faux guards that are…"
260,Not disabled friendly,"Nice and beautiful palace,The beautiful palace was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh during his reign. Among the various forts and palaces of Jaipur, City Palace stands apart,art is loocking so good"
261,The City Palace is a good history lesson,"A disappointing experience for the money paid. Not at all worth the 700rs pricetag to walk the courtyard, which was full of cars, setting up for a wedding. Hounded by ‘guards’ pushing for photos and asking for tips. Photos prohibited in majority of areas allowed with this ticket.Palace is fine, but full of bus-loads of tourists and school trips. save your money would be my advice. Only 30 rs for foreigner to enter grounds of Udaipur Palace which is far more beautiful and a pleasant, relaxing experience. This is first time that we have paid such a large entrance fee in India and we were very disappointed. Other places included in this combo ticket (which is only option for foreigner) only cost between 30-100 rs."
262,Don’t get the audio guides ,"After the glory of Taj, the Red Fort, Fatehpur Sikri and Amber Fort, this is overpriced ( more than all the others!! ), and there is only two items of realative interest, the armoury, and textile and fabric museum.  (No photography allowed) The Observatory is not included in the entry price and costs additional money. Just money-grabbing from foreign tourists, ‘cos they can, and it pads out a day’s itinerary.Hard pass!"
263,Beautiful place,"The royal palace of the former Maharajas of Jaipur after they moved their capital from Amber to here. A very beautiful place, especially the Chandra Mahal and the Sarvato Bhadra courtyard."
264,Lovely,"Puppet shows are held here. Shopping is great. Jaipuri mojris, gold plated jewelry, handcrafted by award winning artisans. Price range starts from 300. Quality and varieties are extremely good."
265,"Stunning palace, a must see","The City Palace of Jaipur is located in the heart of the Jaipur city & opposite Jantar Mantar. There is an INR 200 entry fee. There are 2-3 palaces converted into museums with arts, clothing, jewelry & artifacts from the golden times. Worth a visit. Be prepared to walk since the…"
266,Cool Place,"The palace is owned by the royal family of Jaipur. They still live there, inside the royal quarters. Only a part of it is open to the public.   Lovely environment. Lots of work on textiles, artillery, arts, music and culture are available for display."
267,Interesting...,The foreign entrance fee charge was exorbitant for such lowly maintained buildings and with staff constantly asking for tips. Would not recommend this to anyone.
268,A right royal scam! ,"My husband and I spent a couple of hours here and enjoyed every minute of it. Very well preserved with outstanding architecture. The Royal Family still live in parts of the Palace which of course, is out of bounds to visitors. While we were there, there were wedding preparations…"
269,Beautiful Palace,"The first thing that strikes you when you enter the City Palace Complex is how dirty the approach roads are. Cleanliness and Proper house keeping is given a go-by.With thousands of pigeons located right outside the Palace gates, the stench can be over powering.The INR 3000 + entry ticket for the non-residential part of the City Palace will be prohibitively expensive.The display cum shopping complex seems touristy and expensive.The armory has amazing display of weapons of yore.Guides are more interested in making the tourist shop for the expensive handicrafts than explaining the historical events of the Jaipur Royal Court.Needs cleaning and proper house keeping.A cue or two can be taken from the immaculate maintenance of Umaid Bhavan Palace, Jodhpur.Touristy.Worth visiting once."
270,City Palace of Jaipur - Beautiful Place,The magnificent City Palace is near the centre of Jaipur and dates back to the 18th century.  The Palace is still lived in - the living quarters are sealed off. The Palace is beautifully decorated and houses an exquisite textile museum and displays of armoury and art exhibits. …
271,Palace of sawai mansingh,"While it isn't cheap to have a guide, this time I am pleased I spent the extra. To get through that gate that says ""private"" and tour the palace while the king is in residence was left me wondering at every corner ""how does he feel knowing we are in his home?"" Loved the Winter…"
272,Commercialised tourist trap!,"A beutiful, intricate and extremely colourful palace in the heart of the madness of Jaipur. Well worth a visit!!!"
273,Beautiful palace,"The abode of the present ruler, that's based in the city. Vast expanse of space. Neatly maintained too. An army of irritating guides pouncing on tourists makes an unpleasant experience,tho'."
274,Beautiful but commercialized,"The City Palace is an expensive addition to a tour, costing roughly £35 (GBP) for full entry. We were a little hesitant at first but I can safely say it was well worth the price. The view you receive from the top is incredible, you feel as though you are royalty yourselves! You won’t get to go to the top observatory without the full ticket. To our surprise, we were given royal Masala tea and shortbread biscuits next to the King’s dining hall too, all included in the price. A phenomenal 2 hours spent in the King’s home!"
275,Not to miss,The city palace of Jaipur built in 18 th century by Sawai MannSingh is in the centre of walled city. The palace complex is surrounded by other must visit places of Jaipur like Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar . The main palace has a courtyard from where you can get full view of the…
276,Good palace to visit ,"The City Palace of Jaipur was built by a Maharaja who had moved from Amber city to Jaipur in 1727.  This Palace is nicely constructed with some ornate architecture.  Located within the City Palace are several places of interest:   Chandra Mahal, Sarvatro Bhadra, Clock Tower and Mubarak Mahal.  Nice, historical place to visit while in Jaipur city center."
277,a very beautiful historical place,"The City Palace in Jaipur is a complex of buildings and courtyards, part of which is private and the residence of the current Maharajah. there is a mixture af architectural styles as the palace was developed over the centuries. Check out the Textile museum with supposedly the…"
278,Great place ,"Located in the heart of the city, the palace is well maintained and has a museum and courtyards within its walls. Good for a half day visit."
279,Nothing much to do or see in this palace,The city palace in Jaipur shows what a luxurious life the Jaipur royal family led when in power. A portion of the city palace is still occupied and used by the family. There are two different tours that one can take while inside the palace - one that merely covers a part of the palace that has been converted to a museum of sorts and a larger more pricey (ticket) guided tour covering a larger part of the palace including the royal rooms and halls that are in use. The latter makes the tour very interesting and is a must do.
280,300 year old - beautiful palace,"Right in the centre of the old city, the palace complex now houses two museums with a collection of costumes and textiles and arms. The guards in traditional dress are more than happy to be photographed for a small consideration (INR100).  At the end of the tour one of the…"
281,A lovely palace,"The palace was constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. Like most structures in Jaipur this palace also reflects the fusion of Mughal and Rajput architecture. The magnificent City Palace in Jaipur is one of the most famous tourist attractions located in the old part of the city.  The City Palace complex is spread over a large area of the old city of Jaipur. The palace is divided into a series of courtyards, buildings and gardens. Here you will find attractions like Mubarak Mahal, Chandra Mahal, Diwan-I-Khas, Diwan-I-Aam and Maharani Palace as well as museums. The museums showcases various unique handcrafted products and other things that belong to the royal heritage of the City Palace including a large number of old weapons It also served as a residence for former Maharaja of Jaipur and I believe is still partly occupied by the current maharaja (by name only).The City Palace has three gates, out of which the Virendra Pol and Udai Pol are open to the public."
282,Nice palace; Audio Guide must,"A visit to this beautiful palace has been on my to do list for a long time. This is probably the last time I will be in Jaipur.  The basic ticket is called a 'composite' ticket and to see the genuinely beautiful apartments you have to pay extra.  Basic ticket is 3,500 INR.…"
283,Very interesting Palace BUT way over priced.,"Research shows that the City Palace of Jaipur was established at the same time as the city of Jaipur, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who moved his court to Jaipur from Amber, in 1727. Until 1949, the City Palace was the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of…"
284,Nice Experience,"The palace was constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II.   The City Palace complex is spread over a large area . It has a sequence of gardens, buildings and courtyards, temple and museum to give it a grand view that reflects its historical importance and magnificent royal…"
285,Nothing special to see,"City Palace is one of the main tourist attractions at Jaipur,built by the Maharaja of Jaipur, Sawai Jai Singh during his reign.Entrance : Adults Indian Nationals INR  200.Adults Foreign Nationals INR 700.Children upto a certain age have free entry.If one wants to get real up and close ,there is a package of INR 3500 (USD 50) where one can visit the rooms inside the palace.In my opinion it is too expensive, first one should take only the basic entry ticket as that itself will take about 1 to 2 hours depending on your interest.Beware of people trying to sell them forcefully to you.It is better to opt for a guide rather than tour the place on your own .We hired ours at INR 300,he spoke good English and explained it well to us .Make sure to check his license though.One can get a glimpse of the lives of erstwhile Maharajas of Jaipur here .As one enters,the biggest silver jars in the world,as per Guinness Book are kept on display in the courtyard .Photography is not allowed inside the galleries.They have a clothes gallery where the outfits for various occasions,cashmere shawls,royal gifts ,seat arrangements etc of the royal family are displayed,with many portraits of theirs.Weapons gallary has the various swords and guns .The intricate decorations in Courtyards and Dancing Halls is worth seeing,very delicate and beautiful.I especially liked the courtyard with four doors ,dedicated to Lord Shiva and his family.It is a clean and well maintained place ."
286,Ultimate .,"Since the capital of Kachwaha Rulers shifted from Amer to Jaipur, the City Palace is their official residence. Till today the earstwhile royal family lives here. The City Palace is devided in different parts, the royal family residential area having separate area for royal ladies popularly known Zanana. The City Palace is well guarded on all sides. Some parts of the Royal Palace is open for tourists which includes museum also. Worth visiting place."
287,Curious of the history of Jaipur,"The City Palace was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II at Jaipur during the eighteenth century when he moved from Amber. The Palace was the official seat of the Maharaja till the early Nineteenth century and was the location of cultural and religious events. It houses today a Museum and the Royal Family still live there. The Complex has several buildings, courtyards, galleries, cafes and Museum Trust.  A place definitely worth visiting to any tourist to the City."
288,Very beautiful and must visit,"The city palace, Jaipur was established at the same time as the city of Jaipur, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh || , who moved his court to Jaipur from Amber, in 1727. The architectural design is a combination of Rajput, Mughal and European influence. Make sure to hire a guide to know its historical importance and facts."
289,Do NOT give them your credit card.  They stole the number and security code.,This property is now owned by Raj Pariwar of Jaipur Raj gharana. Rajkumari Diya Kumari and her family lives here.
