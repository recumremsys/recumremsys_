0,A M A Z I N G,"The church was erected in 1883 on the site where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in March 1881 by the Romanov imperial family (""spilled blood"" refers to the murdered emperor). There's is an altar inside the church to mark the place.I'm seen many churches and cathedrals in Europe, including the Vatican, but never have I seen such a beautiful, decorated church. The richness and choice of colors and painting leaves you overwhelmed and in awe."
1,Worth seeing.  A really beautiful church.,The cathedral was built by order of Tsar Alexander III in 1883 on the exact place his father Tsar Alexander II was assassinated by anarchists in 1881. It was completed during the reign of Tsar Nicholas II in 1907.The mosaics inside the church are truly sensational & worth the visit alone. it is a great place of Russian Orthodox Christianity. There is a gift shop inside with everything you could want to remember your visit. It was the most beautiful cathedral I visited in Russia & a must visit attraction if you are in Saint Petersburg.
2,Absolutely Amazing,Built on the site of the assassination of Emperor Alexander II this is an ornate and beautiful church in the Russian style. It is centrally located in St Petersburg and well worth exploring.
3,Beautiful Church with incredible history,"Amazing architecture and history. The church was built on the site where Czar Alexander II was assassinated in 1881 & was undergoing external renovations when we visited in August 2019. The intricate and massive mosaic panels were created by leading artists of the time. The visit was extremely rushed and the inside was over crowded, as it is very popular with tourists, making it a rather unpleasant affair. We were warned not to take any valuables (including passports, wallets etc) inside by our guide as pickpockets frequent the site. Not to be missed when in St Petersburg but could have been a better experience."
4,Amazing architecture and history.,This church was erected on the site where a Czar was assassinated in the nineteenth century.  It is a beautiful building with especially lovely paintings and icons adorning the walls and ceilings.
5,Amazing!,"Magnificent church with outstanding mosaics throughout.  It was built over the site of Tsar Alexander's assassination.  The floor of the building was left open at the place of his death to expose the ground.  Hence the place was built on ""spilled blood"".  Although usually quite crowded, the building is an excellent reflection of the glory of God.  Take some time to reflect on the stories told in mosaic on the walls."
6,Spilled Blood Church,This church was built where Alexander II was assassinated by a bomb.  The inside of the church is covered with mosaics.  Never seen so many mosaics.  The outside is also beautiful.  Nice park behind the church to sit and relax.
7,Riot of Colors!,The church is built on the ground where Zcar Alexander Ii was assasinated ( and his blood was spilled). It is a memorial church which is now a museum with a fee . Closed on wednesdays.
8,Ms D,"This is one of the most beautiful architectural attractions of St. Petersburg. Tsar Alexander II was murdered in 1881 just before this majestic cathedral, which owes its popular name to this bloody historical event. The interiors are wonderful. This is really stunning  interior that is suggested by the even unique and colorful external quality of this worship space and place .  Mosaics inside are very impressive due to their color quantity. It essentially operates as a museum.  Nice access to the entire church along the Griboyedova channel. This is a place   which must not be missed when visiting the city."
9,Must visit,This church is built on the site where Alexander II was killed. It is a unique and phenomenal church. The outside architecture is unique and Russian. The inside is overwhelming with massive mosaics and truly unique Russian orthodox art . Highly recommended!!!
10,Good,This church is the place where blood was spilled of Tsar Alexander II by the revolutionary.Nice Russian art well depicted
11,Beautiful,"Not only built on the place of Alexander II's assassination, but it is a pristine place of historical significance and worship place that has survived in beautiful shape."
12,Beautiful orthodox church looking like a fairy tale,"One for the history buffs!  This beautiful church is built on the site where a much loved Czar (Alexander the second) was assassinated in the 1880's.  (the Finns adore this Czar, it was he who gave the Finns autonomy, they are proud to display a huge statue of him in one of Helsinki's main squares.  Surprisingly, I did not see any similar statue of him in Russia!).  The problem in visiting this church is that it is easily accessible and is so beautiful that it is very popular with tour groups.  That means huge crowds.  Plus, the area surrounding the church is filled with stalls selling all sorts of souvenirs and other knick-knacks.  These stalls add to the general confusion.  Everything about this church is so photogenic.  The inside, the outside, the floor, the ceilings, etc...etc...  Well worth a visit."
13,Viewed from the outside only,They actually have a canopy where Emperor Alexander II was mortally wounded.The religious mosaics are beautiful.
14,Picture Perfect!,"The Church of the Savior on the Spilled Blood is a magnificent structure that you should see while in St. Petersburg. The exterior of the building is dramatic, but the interior is even more so. The entire interior is mosaic, and the mosaics are beautiful. The church was erected on the site of the assassination on Emperor Alexander II, who was the victim of a bomb in 1881 as his carriage rode down the street. His son, Alexander III, had this church erected on the site of the slaying, hence the name. There is a special devotional area on the specific site where Alexander II died."
15,"A must go, if you don't, I don't know what to say","The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood is where Alexander II was assassinated. It is a massive church with beautiful, intricate mosaic panels everywhere. Every inch of the interior is covered with the mosaics, and absolutely gorgeous blue & gold colors abound. It's very popular & very crowded, but oh, so worth a visit! Truly magnificent!"
16,"Picture-Perfect, Inside and Out!","Savior on the spilled blood is one of the churches in Saint Petersburg and probably the most well-known in the city. And in fact, you provably will have to wait to enter, always there are a lot of people. It is located in the place, where Tzar Alexander the 2nd was killed at the end of the 19th Century (in fact, it was buil only few years after it). The facade is really wonderful: it has some different domes with different forms and colours (like the St Basils Cathedral in Moscow). The inner main hall also is incredible: it is totally decorated with a lot of frescos with very nice colours. An incredible experience. A top in the city."
17,Grand and Colourful,"Everyone that visits Saint Petersburg has their favorite site to visit. Mine was the ""Church on the Spilled Blood"". Beautiful architecture on the outside and wonderful mosiacs on the inside. It also boats the longest running clock. It is well worth your time."
18,An incredible sight,"The church's design is an iconic sight of the city. It was horribly treated by the communists, as were practically all the churches in the country, and fell into a very bad state of condition. Please make sure to give attention to the numerous black and white photos in the church that show the interior before the restorations. The restoration has been quite extraordinary. And don't forget to visit the grave of Alexander III, who was assassinated here, in the last of 8 attempts on his life."
19,Beautiful church,"This Russian Orthodox Church sits beside the Neva river and it is not a place to miss while in Saint Petersburg. It is also known as the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. It was built to honor tsar Alexander II of Russia, who was assassinated at the site where the church now sits. Therefore the reference to ""spilled blood"". It has five onion-domes exuberantly decorated and covered with jeweler's enamel. Unfortunately time did not permit me to wait in line to view the interior but I understand it is spectacular....next time."
20,Beautiful ,"This is one of the most impressive attractions in St Petersburg with the grand and tall structures filled completely with images of Christ and gospel.  One have to be in the compound to feel the grandness of man-made presentations of gospel, and not to mention the intrigue history of this church that is in display inside."
21,Another must see,"The Church of the Saviour on Blood is a museum of stunning mosaics. The church was dedicated to the memory of the assassinated tsar and only memorial services) take place.  The church stands in the very place where a bomb was thrown into his carriage by a young man who opposed the Tsar's reforms and there is a canopy built over the spot where it happened.  There is also a side chapel that has the tomb of Czar Nicholas II, the last czar of Russia, his family and his servants, murdered during the Russian revolution.  They were only laid to rest there in 1998, 80 years after their murder."
22,Fantastic mosaics,Last August my wife and I visited St. Petersburg and our visit to the church of the Saviour of the Spilled Blood was one of our highlights. The church is absolutely glorious and in the sun of a summer's day is an absolute stand out.
23,Amazing,Enjoyed seeing this holy ground. Fascinated by the story and the resultant church built on th spot of the ssignation  of the Tsar Alexander II
24,A Striking example of modern day iconography and wall painting,"The outside of this church appears in every travel brochure on Russia. The colorful onion domes are an iconic photo, and this massive church doesn’t disappoint when you actually stand in front of it, but the real stories are inside.The church was erected in 1881 on the sited where Emperor Alexander II was attacked and “spilled his blood"". A few of the actual cobblestones where the Emperor fell are preserved in a memorial, but that’s not the splendor or miracle of this church.The splendor is the hundreds of mosaic murals covering the walls depicting Old and New Testament stories, each created with thousands of tiny tiles. The splendor continues with a bejeweled, golden altar that shines bright in the dimly lit church. But, there is also a miracle to be seen here.In World War II, a German plane dropped a large bomb that crashed through the top of the church dome and buried itself in a wall, but did not explode. If it had, the church, no doubt, would have been destroyed. No one knew that a bomb was inside when the hole was fixed.  Decades later, in the 1960’s, the unexplored bomb was discovered and successfully disarmed and removed. Truly a miraculous story! You can see photos of the bomb, the hole it made, and where it lay hidden all those years. So, this church is much more than a photo op. Plan to spend two hours walking around outside and studying the inside."
25,"A Must Do, when in St.Petersburg","It’s a famous church in the city. When I visited in early March 2020, there were renovations happening, but you could still see a majority of the building and I was still impressed."
26,Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood,"The Church of the Savior on the Spilled Blood, also known as the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, was built between 1883 and 1907 on the site where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in 1881.On the outside the building is colourful and visually stunning, and quite a contrast to the more traditional Russian buildings in that area, and was designed to resemble the famous onion-domed St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.If you thought the outside was interesting, don't miss the inside, which features over 7500 square metres of wonderful mosaics, and the inside has been beautifully restored in recent years so the colours are just immense. Inside there is an elaborate shrine on the exact spot where Alexander II was killed.It's rightly one of the top tourist atractions in St Petersburg and well worth a visit."
27,Must see,"We passed by the Kazan Cathedral and then walked along the channel embankment to Church of the Savior on Blood. The Church of Savior on Blood is quintessential Russian architecture with onion domes. After paying 250 Rub entry fee per person, we went inside to explore. There are numerous interesting mosaic work inside the church as well as the notable spot where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated."
28,Amazing Church,"If you can’t go to Red Square in Moscow to see St. Basil’s onionhead, this is every bit as good.  It received this name, “On” Spilled Blood, because it was built on the exact site of the assassination of Emperor Alexander II in 1883.  Alexander was beloved because of his many reforms including freedom to serfs.  It is an unusual church for several reasons.  First, there is a special area to one side dedicated to the exact location of the spilled blood of the emperor.  Second, it doesn’t have a main entrance.  Rather there are 2 doors on opposing sides.  Third, there is not a single painting in the church.  While it is very distinctive for its brilliant colors and gold framing, it is all done in mosaics – over 23,000 pieces of tile. The depictions of stories from the Bible and Russian history are dazzling!"
29,Beautiful Church with Interesting History,"If the Saint Isaac's Cathedral has some mosaics then Savior on the Spilled Blood is THE mosaics church of St Petersburg.  And according to the guide it's done differently than others.It is pretty inside and out as well.  Too bad heavy rain didn't allow much photography outside.Anyway full of tour groups and smaller than the other cathedral.  Still lots of Kodak moments, that's about it."
30,One of the most iconic attractions of the city,Impressive building with similarities to St Basil's in Moscow. Central tower under refurbishment when we visited. Didn't have time to visit the inside.
31,Very beautiful,"Beautiful structure, has strong resemblance to St Basil at Red square. the middle tower was under renovation and so covered when i visited. Located by the side of a canal, gets a beautiful view from Nevsky Prospekt."
32,A sight not to be missed,This church is one of the most important and beautiful examples of Russian orthodox churches in Sankt Peterburg. I like it a lot. Masterpieces of mosaic pictures. Wonderful and extraordinary marble floor. Fantastic Iconostasis. Very beautiful and authentic church with fabulous story.
33,"Extravagant mosaic work, beautiful interior",The Saviour on the Spilled Blood is an incredible sight with the caveat that the outside will be covered in various stages of scaffolding for maintenance over the next 5 years which does not take away from the beauty of the structure. The outside shows the iconic Russian Orthodox Church while the inside takes your breath away with mosaics covering every wall. Take the time to wade through the crowds and wait for breaks of peace and quiet to appreciate the beauty and workmanship of the individual mosaics.
34,The must see,Like most of the churches in St Petersburg this church has been beautifully restored and is a major tourist attraction that is worth the visit
35,Fabulous,"When we visited, the tallest spire of this church was covered while being renovated. Even so, the building is spectacularly beautiful, with a fascinating history."
36,Church of the Savior,"Amazing visit to this historical church. It was to be demolished in the 1940's but during the war the date was postponed. The architecture is amazing and inside the church is historical and just breath taking. The site where Tsar Alexander was injured is there inside the door, with the pavement and railing intact. Mosaics of Saints looking down upon all visitors. Thank God it was saved."
37,Most amazing orthodox church I have ever seen.,"Well, it's unlikely that anyone who visits St Petersburg will miss this lovely iconic church. A visit there is not mererly to tick off the box but purely enjoyable and a divine experience. Keep aside atleast an hour for the visit."
38,Amazing church. Must visit.,"Remarkable work of restauration post WWII.Incredible mosaics,  reflection of the centuries of Orthodox faith."
39,Worth a visit,One of the things I wanted to see while visiting St Peterburg. Beautiful building! We did not visit the inside. The middle tower was unfortunately undergoing a renovation during the time I was there.
40,Historically and architecturally interesting church.,"It is easy to see why this church is high on the bucket list of vistors to St Petersburg...it is visually stunning both inside and out. The painted murals and mosaics that adorn the interior are incredible and the exterior architecture is picture- postcard perfect.....you could easily spend an hour marvelling at all the adornments inside & outside this building. The story behind the history of this church is fascinating too and it all justs adds to the emotion that goes along with this church.The crowds inside the church are nearly always large and there are numerous signs to beware of pick-pockets so keep your valuables guarded, but don't let this deter you from visiting this stunning church."
41,Church,There’s scaffolding on the top of the church at present but it’s still magnificent. Beautiful inside and out with masses of mosaics it’s really worth a visit even if you have to queue. As always in St Petersburg you must be careful with your valuables and keep an eye out for pickpockets as it gets busy outside where the stalls are.
42,Awesome,Such a pretty and lovely church in the middle of city. Entrance 350 rubels and worth the visit any time and several times.
43,Architectural masterpiece,"Nearly destroyed 3 times by a bomb lodged in the roof, the Soviets and the Germans it is only recently fully restored. It is a place which makes you think about what it means to be alive."
44,Simply beautiful ,"Beautiful church to look at. Unfortunately it was partly hooded when we visited in December 2019. The church was beautiful, but be aware of the ""live actors"" who hang around the area. We got ambushed by one of them when taking a picture in front the church. He just attacked the photo and them later tried to demand us a bunch of money."
45,Spectacular inside ,"Visit was obscured by works going on on the facade of the church, so we could not really see and appreaciate as it should be"
46,BEWARE : Lots of destructive pickpockets inside,"Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, very colourfully and special saint pictures, such go .The celling picture is very nice and good . I never been the church is fully picturing, like wallpaper, unfortunately , outside the church is on maintenance process, but still recommenced to visiting."
47,Lovely Spiritual place,"We had been to many Cathedrals in Russia before finishing our trip in Saint Petersburg. The people there were happy to explain what the things mean with out being pushy or judgemental with the non Christians that were with us that day. Kind, polite and friendly"
48,Wow !!,"If you love art and architecture, you will be blown away by this building.  It is built on the spot where a czar was killed and that spot is within the church."
49,Beautiful Historic Monument,The most beautiful view of Our Lady of Egypt (from the bible scene Flight into Egypt) I had ever seen. In mosaic.
50,Spectacular,Both the exterior and the interior of this church are amazing and form the backdrop to many views around St Petersburg.
51,Worth the visit,This church is the main reason I came to St Petersburg. I have wanted to see this beautiful up close. It did not disappointment. Words cannot describe its beauty!
52,Beautiful place of Russin culture,"This temple has awesome and nice appearance, and their coupole and architecture itself shows they are heritage of Russia. I recomend you to go inside it and sure it will help you to understand about that cathedral. If you are busy, just taking pics in front of it is fine and really worthy I think. I visited here at daytime and night, but I liked at daytime more, but at night also nice as well and have night's attractive things of it."
53,Amazing,"We visited The Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood at night. Unfortunately, the doors close at 5:30 pm. We had the chance to enjoy this sight from the outside only. It is surely having an elaborate façade & brightly coloured onion domes. The work is simply opulent.  The work was carried out by (30) finest artists in the Russian Empire. The church took 24 years to build. The photos uploaded are night photos only. I will visit next year for during the day. SEE photos."
54,Amazing,"There are several churches to visit in St Petersburg, and this one is a must-see!  Jump off the City Red Bus and take a tour or go to services to enjoy the cathedral!"
55,Amazing,Simply beautiful! What a wonderful piece of architecture and history to be found in St Petersburg. Unfortunately part of the church was under construction when we visited but it didn’t stop the awe and beauty. Well worth a visit and photo opportunity
56,Visually stunning,"This building was never intended to be a church nevertheless a cathedral as it had no parish nor priests.No need to buy tickets on line nor in advance since there is not that many tourists in St. Petersburg. Loved visiting in late Fall.Before entering the cathedral see closely the forged iron fence matching the small church that now is a museum across the street. Upon entering the cathedral you will be amazed by the quality of the mosaic works in the interior, many of the signed by prominent Russian artists of the turn of the 20th century. All of them framed by leafy motifs as if tapestry.Do check the canopy standing on jasper columns crowned by a topaz cross. It occupies the spot where the tsar was mortally wounded. Under the canopy there was kept a fragment of a cobbled roadway shed with tsar’s blood. On the day we visited there were a few carnations thrown in the floor.Upon exiting take some pictures and do check the granite plates put on the cathedral with citations of the main events of reign and the decrees of Alexander II. English small plaques are places by the forged iron fence.There is extensive information on the restoration works being done since the seventies with photos depicting immense damage by the Nazi bombing. One can still see a lot of the damage caused by water leaks on the mosaics."
57,Worth the trip,"This building is a most spectacular sight, and is alongside one of the many canals in St Petersburg. There are many photo opportunities as you walk around the outside, but during our visit some of the domes were being refurbished. There is also a small market on the approach."
58,Nice but not overwhelming,This building screams RUSSIA.  There are lovely views of the church as you walk towards it.  The photographs really do not do the architecture justice.  We spent about an hour inside which was long enough to discover its story and beauty.
59,Reverent and Historically Significant,"You have to see this building if in St. Petersburg during daylight, but at night if possible too. It is the most beautiful building in St. Petersburg and there are more nice buildings too."
60,Beautiful church. Lots of tourists!,I loved the story behind the construction of this church. A definite must see if you're visiting St Petersburg
61,icon for a reason,Amazing how they create the interior artworks in mosaic tiles. A must to visit when you are in St. Petersburg. One of my favourite attractions.
62,Beautiful,"Best cathedral need to visit in st.pertaining. just a walking distance from kazan  cathedral. Union style doms are amazing. Ticket is 350 rubles. Tha arts of the wall and the celling really eye catching. The jesus who looks down from the celling is my best icon inside the cathedral. There were few guide also, but i did not use them. Better you read  before go, so you can enjoy and learn more."
63,Beautiful,"We visited the Savior on the Spilled Blood as part of a cruise excursion. The outside of the church is hard to miss and quite distinct. Once inside, the mosaics are impressive. To think how much time and care was taken to create all the mosaics is hard to believe. The history of the church is also very interesting. We would definitely recommend a visit if in St. Petersburg."
64,Must see,"Although currently having some renovations, this church is still a breathtaking sight, especially as a long view from Nevsky Prospect. Stunning interior as well as the exterior. A wonderful historical site"
65,Very Touristy but Spectacular,"This cathedral is beautiful. It's not quite as colorful as St. Basil's, still spectacular. One of the spires is under renovation. I recommend going either very early or very late in order to have less of a crowd."
66,Beautiful,"Church of the Savor on spilled blood now a museum is a unique and breathtaking architecture with unbelievable interior mosaic, supposedly one of the largest mosaic collections in Europe.. The restoration work done is amazing  Be prepared for big crowds. Buy tickets from the machine just outside."
67,Mosaic masterpieces,"We visited the church around 9 pm after dinner. Yes, it has a late evening entrance. We were struck by the modern day rendition of the medieval church paintings. A remarkable architectural piece. It is built at the place where the Tsar Alexander II was assasinated."
68,Absolutely lovely,"This church looks pretty, but once you enter it, you will lose your breath! The history of this church is so rich and so interesting. It almost got destroyed 3 times, isn't it crazy?! We went on a tour with a local company called ""experience Russia tours"" and we loved our tour. So much to learn and so much to see. This church definitely was The Best thing we saw in St. Petersburg. You should not leave St. Petersburg without touring this cathedral!"
69,Very different,"This is a ""must do"" miss in St Petersburg, right on the canal.The outside is beautiful and the inside is just as impressive.  Audio guide in English and other languages.."
70,Less is not more -  More is more,"I would rate this as one of the top places to visit in St Petersburg along with the Hermitage, St Isaacs, the Faberge Museum and Peterhof. The exterior is very picturesque (and would be better still if not under renovation). The interior is also very beautiful and interesting. I would recommend the audioguide which gave more insight into its history."
71,"Nice church Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, very colourfully and special.","Very different to other churches thanks to its mosaic walls and ceiling. Beautiful, simply beautiful both indoors and outdoors."
72,Excellent,I was thrilled to see this in person. Beautiful church. Great backdrop to a picture. Must visit Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood!
73,Wow!,"I was very impressed when entering the church. Such beautiful art. And you don't hsve to queue for the tickets, the ticket machines are available next to the entrace."
74,Very nice ,"As part of out our two day guided tour of St. Petersburg, we were taken to the Saviour of the Spilled Blood Church during the first afternoon of the tour.When our tour coach arrived at the church, we were just blown away by the external decoration and architecture of the church.As we walked up to the church, there were large crowds gathered around it. Some people were simply taking photos of the magnificent exterior of the church while others were in a long queue waiting to buy entry tickets. However, because we were on a guided tour, our tour guide took care of the ticketing issues and we were able to go straight in.Once inside, we had some difficulty keeping up with our tour guide simply because the interior was so crowded. We found some parts of the interior of the church to be a little dark. Improved lighting would make for better viewing of the artwork, sculptures and artefacts. Whilst we were greatly impressed by the beautifully decorated interior and especially the central dome, we actually thought was the exterior architecture and decoration of the church were more impressive.This is a “must–see” attraction for any tourist visiting St. Petersburg. However, we recommend taking a guided tour to avoid delays and so that you are provided with useful information about the church and it adornments."
75,Very special place in St. Petersburg ,"I have long admired the architectural style and lavish, colourful decoration on this building and was pleased it was included in our TJ Travel 2-day St Petersburg tour. As part of a tour group, we gained instant admission even though there were very large crowds of people both outside and inside the church. The crafsmanship and decoration of both exterior and interior were superb and a sight to behold. As a keen photographer, I found it ideally needed time to record faithfully the numerous features in the changing light conditions. Notwithstanding that, I managed to take many nice photos of the almost endless number of subjects. The mosaics and sheer artistry inside the church are simply outstanding. I greatly enjoyed the experience and have taken much away from the place, including knowledge of its history. Very highly recommended!"
76,Very interesting,The outside of this church is magnificent. The towers are colorful and ornate. The crowds around the church indicate how popular a tourist attraction it is.
77,Must visit in St Petersburg,St Petersburg is a very European city so this church is a big reminder you are in Russia. It can be very busy so work out the best times to go. Get some local knowledge. It was busy when we go there but not San Marco busy. It's an amazing structure.
78,Breathtaking,A visit to this church is a must on a visit to St Petersburg. The interior is quite spectacular and the spot where Alexander 11 was assassinated is very moving
79,veyr long queues for little that is different,"Really good, colorful historical monument one should visit during his / her visit to Saint Petersburg. This was my star attraction which in fact took me to Saint Petersburg."
80,Under construction,This is a spectacular cathedral inside and out.  The exterior was being renovated so the exterior view was somewhat obscured.  This is a must-see in St. Petersburg.I think it is a museum now as there is an entrance fee and the building is crowded.
81,Impressive mosaic art,More than “ just another church in Russia.”  We are very thanks that the exhibits were also in English!
82,One of the most beautiful churches in St Pet,This is a must if you only have one day in St Petersburg. Amazing artwork and fabulous history. Will not disappoint. You will never see a better display of mosaics.
83,Night Visit,"Please take a close look on the photos comparing the state of this church on earlier decades! What a job in refurbishment. Overwhelming mosaics, different colour stonework. A masterpiece."
84,MUST VISIT FOR HISTORY..,A beautiful historical building and it’s worth visiting it. You will not regret. It’s looks grand from afar and grandeur as you move towards it. The only complaint is that it’s too packed with people inside and out.
85,World treasure on restoration,This Church was under maintenance thus we did not see all the domes in their glory but it was still very interesting to learn the history and also see the mosaics.  Take a guided tour.
86,"Amazing, but beware of pickpockets","I was fascinated the entire time! Beautiful cathedral, worth reading a bit about the history behind its name. From the outside it looked like a gingerbread house, and the inside of the church did not disappoint! Usually when something is this magnificent from the outside, the inside is underwhelming, but not this cathedral! It was so rich with floor to ceiling mosaics (it was actually a bit overwhelming) once you are in, it was difficult to decide where to look, it’s that beautiful. As expected, it’s very very crowded. Book your ticket online in advance and don’t risk booking last minute."
87,Amazing and not to be missed,"One of the most spectacular church interiors I have seen ! Of course all Russian Orthodox churches are. The outside is picturesque, this is a must if you are visiting St Petersburg!"
88,Gorgeous!,"This church is a real icon of the city, so when it is clad so thoroughly in order for work to be carried out the views from close up as well as across the city are sadly affected."
89,Exquisite,"the church is amazing, the panels on the ceiling and walls are so detailed. The area around the original place of the shooting is fascinating. Beware the church gets packed, its really busy so hold on to your belongings"
90,Touristy visit,"The ""spilled blood"" here does not refer to the blood of Christ, but that of Alexander the First. There was an attempted asasination attempt, ultimately successful, on him that happened here and this huge church was built around the site where it happened. The inside is a mosaic museum that is without compare world wide. Yes, it has a lot of religious icons, but the craftsman ship, the hundres of thousands of work hours it took to create this is incalculable.Two hours if it's busy."
91,Incredibly beautiful and worth a visit.,One of the most ornate churches you’ll ever visit. The story of how the church got its name is fascinating. I won’t spoil it for you.
92,Extraordinary and beautiful church ,You don't want to miss it. The history of this site during the communist era and after is quite unique. The picture in show in the church are very representative.
93,incredible mosaic,My aim was to visit this Cathedral and my expectations weren't disappointed.  The colors outside the church were wonderful as were those inside. The mosaics were wonderful  and a photographers' dream.
94,This memorial church has extraordinary history!,"The inside is full of murals, telling the story of Jesus. There is also a superb altar. Not uncomfortably crowded inside so you could move around happily."
95,Incredable Place,"Simply extraordinary. Impressive Mozaic work inside, grandiose marble altars. Worth seeing if you are in Sankt Petersburg."
96,So beautiful iside,"It is a very beautiful church, with amazing paintings on the inside walls. The entry fee is not very expensive and it is worth it."
97,Just amazing!,Saw the church in the day and night - obviously I wish I had been during the summer months but seeing the facade lit up at night was spectacular!
98,reminder of the one in Moscow on Red Square.,"like almost all orthodox churches I have seen, this one is gorgeous and so colorful, you never get enough of it!"
99,Breathtaking!,It is an extremely beautiful church from the outside and the surrounding area with the musicians playing on the streets and the street painters making amazing artworks make it even more beautiful!But i think it is not worth it at all to pay to enter cause it is a typical church without anything really special and actually it is more like a shopping mall to buy souvenirs.
100,Review of savior on spilled blood,"So beautiful church both inside and out. Defenitely worth going inside too. Such beautiful icons, mosaics and colours everywhere. This is a must see in St. Petersburg."
101,Stunning,"It's an incredible place, completely restored after the second world war. Full of colors, gold, blue..it's really difficult to go out. Keep attention to the people outside with birds...they put them on your shoulders and after they ask you money."
102,Not to miss,Very crowded like all sights in St Petersburg. But worth going inside to see.  Went with a private guide so got in and out quickly.
103,Crazy Ornate,We visited in late afternoon. It was very crowd. There is a paid entrance fee.  The church museum is a treasure trove of Russian folk art.
104,Excellent Cathedral,"We visited the Church on Spilled Blood on a recent cruise call to St Persburg. We've seen the exterior of this building on several previous visits but this was the first time that we had to opportunity to view the interior - we were not disappointed! The interior is even more ornate than outside, every surface is gilded, painted or both. The floor surface where the blood was spilled is preserved although there is not a lot to see except the cobbled surface.We visited this building independantly rather than as part of a tour. We bought our tickets from a ticket booth outside and paid using plastic rather than cash - so easy to do and saves messing about changing your cash into roubles. I didn't make a note of the price but it wasn't expensive."
105,Don't get put off by the name - read on,"This is the type of architecture we expected to see here in Russia and it amazed us both inside and out.  It is a pleasant walk along the canal and we saw a man feeding sparrows on his hand, which made our day.  A simple pleasure.  There are many stalls lined along the canal walkway selling Russian Dolls, Faberge Eggs, tat, etc.  A must see when ih this Fabulous City."
106,Most beautiful church,You will undoubtedly find yourself outside this church taking photos of the beautiful exterior at some point during your trip to St  Petersburg. I recommend buying tickets to go inside - they’re very good value and easy to purchase at the kiosk. The interior is quite stunning and looking at the exact spot where the Tsar was assassinated is quite moving.
107,Unbeliavable,Both interior and exterior of the church are beautiful and amazing. The exterior of the main dome was under restoration at the time of our visit. It was a bit crowded but it was worth the visit.
108,Spectacular,"The inside is even more spectacular than the outside (which unfortunately was partly covered by scaffolding during our visit).  We went independently but there were multiple guided group tours inside, most of which were in English.  If you have time to hang around a bit, you can pick up quite a lot of the detailed information from listening in to these groups."
109,One of the Highlights of St. Petersburg,This church has a spectacular display of mosaic works and marble. It is worth a visit but i felt it a bit expensive considering the amount of time spent there compared with other attractions in the city. The crowds were also daunting and spoil the atmosphere. I would say the inside of the church is worth seeing only if you love art or want to see the elaborate interior and are prepared to put up with being jostled by a large group of tourists. I also found the lighting did not produce good photos.
110,"Extraordinary cathedral. Lovely to see, especially from the outside.",Our tour only made a photo stop at the Cathedral.The domes of the Cathedral are impressive and colourful.The tent-roofed steeple was wrapped up under renovation.
111,Not to be missed,"Amazing architecture, a beautiful festival of colors, the great landmark of Saint Petersburg reminds us very important Historic Events regarding the House of Romanov. The Church on the Spilled Blood blooms at the end of Griboyedov Canal like a rare and exotic perennial flower, stunning the viewer with its riot of colors.Take your time and enjoy your visit."
112,Outstanding building,"One of the best and most iconic churches, centrally located with easy access, come early to avoid crowds"
113,takes your breath away,This is the most amazing church we have ever seen. A must see while in St Petersburg. It is truly amazing and words can’t describe it.
114,"Must see, bucket list place.",Visited this site as part of the two day St Petersburg experience offered on our cruise. As it was a wet morning we did not see this st its best against grey skies and the scaffolding and hoarding also detracted.  However that said and with no time to visit the inside this is truly a fine example of Russian architecture.  The colourful domes are a stand out feature that can be seen from many parts of the city.
115,Beautiful Church,"Very impressive at a distance especially with the gleaming gold onion domes the church with its bloody history takes on a more ""gingerbread"" effect when viewed at close quarters. The interior is classic intricate Russian orthodox and deserves a couple of hours viewing."
116,Impressive,"Do not miss seeing this magnificent church! It's a pity that the exterior is partly covered in scaffolding but obviously it's necessary to do maintenance to preserve it. Anyway it's still amazing…but go inside and it's absolutely breathtaking! The walls and pillars are crammed full of strikingly colourful mosaics and the floor is made of pink marble. Photography is allowed inside. This was my favourite place in St. Petersburg because it's so unique and incredible.Just be aware that around the church is a prime tourist spot and we were warned about pickpockets operating, so you need to be careful of what's going on around you and keep your belongings safe."
117,A treasure trove,"My husband and I were part of the MSC Meraviglia  St. Petersburg Excursion in September 2019 and the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was one of the attractions we visited. The structure is so beautiful and truly a work of art with its intricate design and colored turrets, though part of it is under construction. Unfortunately, the church was closed at the time of our visit, so we were unable to see the inside of it. There were many tourists taking pictures but it did not deter us from being one of them. Our tour bus stopped a few yards from the front of the church,  so we did not have to walk far to get a closer view and get a perfect picture,"
118,Must see,"There are lots of photo angles from the streets and canals and parks around it. Inside is absolutely spectacular.  Do not miss this church, inside or out, if you’re in St. P"
119,Savior on the Spilled Blood,"A beautiful Church with richly decorated interiors. Photography is allowed inside, which is great as not all churches allow it. Very populair with tourists so can get quite busy. If you are a student make sure you have an ISIC card as they won't accept a Uni or College student card for a discount."
120,Russian style church,"For me the visit of this church was just a bit above average as the tower is in the progress of renovation which did mean, that photos are worthless at the moment from the outside.Inside the church is beautiful but also not the total ""wow experience"" which I expected.Anyway a must see in Saint Petersburg and still worth visiting."
121,Stunning Church - both inside and out,"Outside is very pretty, but part of it was under scaffolding.  However inside was amazing! The interior walls are covered in restored mosaics.  And the alter so beautiful. GLAD WE BOUGHT TICKETS AND WENT INSIDE!!  There is a beautiful park outside the church next to the Russian Museum, which was wonderful as well."
122,Sights of St Petersburg,"There are many places to visit in Sint Petersburg, given its beauty and history, this church should not be missed. One should spend enough time to get the best sense of the details  in the different mosaics and religious symbols"
123,Beautiful church ,"The church is amazing and lovely inside and out.  (Sadly, there is a bit of scaffolding currently outside as some much needed exterior upkeep is taking place.). The interior is filled with awe inspiring mosaics that art lovers can appreciate for their skill and beauty in creation, while Christians can additionally feel a special sense of devotion to the Father and Son and share the love the makers had.  A lot of tour groups pass through, but finding a quiet corner to sit and be in wonder, meditate and offer a prayer of thanks for all of the blessings and good things in life is a memorable experience."
124,A must see,This is a must for any visitor to St Petersburg.My breath was taken away by the beauty of this Church.No words and no photo can describe what I have seen.It is truly a masterpiece not to be missed.
125,Wonderful inside and out,I never suspected to see all mosaics on the wall. It must have taken forever to complete. The more than life like size mosaics told of Jesus miracles. My mouth gaped open at the beauty of it all. Also I now understand why it’s the  Church on Spilled Blood. This is a must see.
126,Colourful domes,A must see.  The walls are made entirely out of mosaics.  The exterior is beautiful.  The top dome was under construction when I visited in 10/19.  It's one of the prettiest churches I have ever seen.
127,Stunning but unusual church in St Petersburg - Well worth a visit,"When in St. Petersburg,  this place is not to be missed. It is very beautiful from outside, but even better from inside. Even if the que for the tickets is long, it is worth the efforts going inside. You will see most intricate mosaic work all over the walls and ceiling."
128,In love :),"Attractive and impressive exterior perhaps best viewed from the banks of the nearby canal. The fine, five domes dominate."
129,Waste of money,30 Minutes would be enought the visit this church; they offer free guided tours; the church is close to other activities.
130,Must Visit,"Definitely worth paying the 350 Rubles to go inside... the interior is absolutely marvelous. Virtually every surface is covered with intricate, brightly-colored glass mosaic. And the floors are gorgeous complex patterns in different colored stones. Beautiful."
131,SW,"The outside of this cathedral is gorgeous; the inside, even more so.The intricate mosaics that cover the interior walls dominate the huge building. The colors are wonderful.I found it interesting that the cathedral was looted after the Russian Revolution, used as a morgue during the Siege of Leningrad (World War II), used as a vegetable warehouse after the war, but has been almost miraculously restored to its former glory."
132,Ashtonishing architecture,Came to see the number one tourist site and it is stunning interesting to learn the history and what the church was used for by our guide other than a church. Truly stunning mosaics as others have stated.Currently being renovated but still amazing worth walking around the whole outside.
133,Amazing Art,It is a place- monument that if you are there you have to visit it during the  day or  in the night with the lights
134,Interesting church,This is such a unique and beautiful church and a must see on any Saint Petersburg tour itinerary.  Easy to find too.  Before you go read about the history of the church and all the turmoil surrounding its construction.  The inside of the church is breathtaking!  Don't miss it.
135,Cathedral of the Spilled Blood,"No longer a church, but a tourist attraction.  The main spire was covered in scaffolding when we went, but it is still a hugely attractive sight.  Sadly, far too many tourists inside!"
136,Outstanding,It is well worth an hour of your time to see the amazing frescoes adjourning the walls. On the way to the hermitage museum as well.
137,Beautiful building,Wonderful. Pity we could not take nice pics because of maintenance but still such a holy place to be in
138,Does not disappoint,"We thought this church was amazing on the inside and the outside.  It was extremely crowded when we went (late August), so we didn't spend a lot of time inside, but so glad we were able to see it!"
139,Very I retesting ,"Absolutely stunning church, inside and out!The domes outside the church are striking in colors of blue, green, white and gold.  The interior has been fully restored.  The mosaics are beautiful.  Interesting history of this church.  Don’t miss it!"
140,Night time,This was the icing on the cake with our visit to St Petersburg.  We did a trip from the cruise ship. It did have some scaffolding round the out side but did not spoil it. Inside was the best part.all the inside was not painted but mosaic pieces.  It does get busy but it wasn't too bad when we went.
141,Amazing landmark,Impressive artwork and architecture. I went there with a friend as we saw it on our travel guide and it is something not to miss. I would highly recommend it!
142,BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT,"I have been familiar with church and christian culture...i turn on candle and speak to my god, it brings me a deep calmness..."
143,A Place Out Of Time,"Excellent Cathedral, Very Festive and Welcoming. Tour Guide Ivan from Get Your Guide was very Hospitable and Knowledgeable."
144,Worth a visit,"If you do a tour in St. Petersburg you’ll find it a very special place, We were lucky to be there while a ceremony was taking place. Absolutely beautiful,"
145,Stunning,On a whim bought ticket as walking by. Thankful we did. Amazing mosaic work throughout the building. Restoration is continuing.
146,Amazing,"Though it was under repair when we visited, this church was still an incredible piece of history to see. The incredible mosaic art on the interior walls is truly breathtaking, and the arc created over ""the spilled blood"" is quite something (you can almost feel the weight and gravity of history here!) It's not a long visit activity, but a good 30-45 minutes gives you enough time to see it all and read about the history - although seeing this stop as part of a tour would probably be your best bet."
147,Wonderful,"A must-see place for any traveler in St. Petersburg one of the largest and most beautiful museums, it is recommended to take instruction due to the large collection of exhibits.  I would recommend all members to visit the place"
148,A must see,"The opulence of the church is amazing: the icons, ceilings, walls, floors. An so much gold!The people didn't have anythong to eat, but the Tsar and church lived in another opulent world.Beware the square in front of the church is known for very refinedpickpockets."
149,Crowded,Not worth the wait to get in. The exterior holds the main attractions. the columns on the exterior have a great story to tell and are free to see. Unless you have a lot of time to waste  would give this a miss. and it is not wheelchair friendly.
150,Amazing,This is a stunning church. The icons are beautiful. Unfortunately there are many tourists in here and it is often busy. This church was built on the assassination site of the tsar Alexander II. There are market stalls nearby and even a few fun characters to take your money for a photo.
151,Must visit Orthodox Cathedral in Russia,If you are in St-Petersburg you should visit this place. It's amazing. When you are inside the Cathedral you have special feelings....
152,One of the Must visit places,"Church is very beautiful from the out side but we got disappointed when we went in. We have seen much better churches around the globe.Save you money for the Saint Isaac´s Cathedral, which is a hundred times better. Best place to get a photo is on the right side of the entrance on the opposite side of the river."
153,One of the best temples in St. Petersburg,To see such painstaking  details. Love of saintly figures was awe inspiring.  Not much cost to attend. 700 rubles for 2. Many tour guides give  information in russian no charge. Not far from downtown area. Must visit
154,Amazing mosaics,"The outside is so beautiful and then you go inside and you are blown away by the mosaics, colours, altars etc. A sight to behold."
155,"Really, really busy, but extremely impressive",Brilliant mosaics inside. The whole inside looks like an assortment of comic books. 30 mins are enough to cover.
156,Absolutly Beautiful,"A nice place to visit, especially his beautiful exteriors. First and very important reminder. Many tourist there and queued up for the tickets, beware of your personal belongings!Mosaics painting and wall are fabulous.  The church is small, dark and crowded. Not many English description!  Souvenir shop is good (again, beware of your personal belongings during purchasing).It is a must see (exteriors only), for interiors you may buy a detailed English guide book instead of paying entrance fee."
157,Has to be seen inside,"This church is interesting and the decor on the gaudy side, but typical of the period. It can get crowded, and there are signs warning of pickpockets so be aware of your belongings. Anyway there is lots of ceiling and wall art all in small tile pieces, which makes that spectacular in itself. If you like churches I we ould visit, if not you may not like."
158,Beautiful,"Such time, effort and money to design and build this magnificent church in times before automation of machinery when people were skilled and true craftsmanship was prominent. As part of a city tour, whilst on a world cruise, we spent 2 days in St Petersburg and how lucky were we with the weather. Apparently they receive 60 days of sunshine a year and we had 2 of them. The church is under restoration at present so didn’t view at its best but it was still an exhilarating experience."
159,sumptous,"This being my first trip to Russia, I was amazed at the historical value of what I was witnessing.  Each church tell it own story.  My wife and I were fortunate to have a friend who lives there point our places of interest for us to see while she worked.  This church is under renovation but the artwork on the walls and ceilings is not to be missed."
160,This Church has an interesting history ,"This stunning church delivers beauty both inside and out and should certainly be on any visitors itineary. Looking from the outside with the gold and colourful domes you can't imagine that the inside could be even more beautiful, but the mosaic work has to be seen to be believed. The restoration work to bring it backto its former glory must be applauded."
161,Amazing cathedral ,I always wanted to see this church. It's under construction  it's very old and beautiful. Everything in St Petersburg was so clean and renovated from the war that destroyed most of these places.
162,Inside was my FAVORITE!!,Both the exterior and the interior of this church amaze.The decorations inside are in mosaic.That the place was used as a storage for years is scary to know.
163,Scaffolding necessary for maintenance,"Visited (outside) on our walk around SP, near the canal there are a variety of tourist stalls. Didn't realise until later that there is a combined ticket with other religious buildings.  Worth the view from the outside to appreciate the architecture."
164,Worth your time,"I love churches and I visit them everywhere I travel.  Temples in Asia, churches in Italy! Honestly I can say the churches in Russia are stunningly beautiful as well as historical. I enter the church in pure awe of its beauty.  I felt a calm come over me as I looked at the beautiful art on the walls.  A must see."
165,Unique Church,Absolutely amazing building and history coming out of the walls. Loved it.Our guide gave us so much history of the buildings and its character.
166,Magnificent Interior,"We visited the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood as part of a 2 day cruise ship excursion, which got us inside with a minimal of waiting.   Fabulous!   Very busy and hectic, but completely worth the visit.  Lots of old religious icons and art.  Amazing.  Get there!"
167,Very crowded but worth the effort,very special church. Marvelous mosaic all over the place.  The explanations in English helped us a lot.
168,A St Pete's must see,"The cathedral is fantastically beautiful inside and outside with its fantastic tiled fresoes, ceramic walls and structures and beautiful icons. But it was completely full of tourists and movement around the cathedral was almost impossible. More concerning was the poorly controlled entrance where 4 long parallel queues of people stood in the rain and pushed dangerously to get in against the barriers. Independent tourists were mixed with large tour parties, buying tickets and also entering the cathedral. It certainly spoilt the experience, which was the worst one we had in lovely St Petersburg."
169,marvelous,I advise everyone to visit this place. I have not seen anything unique before. Inside all the walls are mosaic.
170,Awesome and unique,"We couldn't pass up a chance to visit this church. From the outside it is just beautiful, even though it was surrounded by some scaffolding as work was underway.We bought tickets to look around the church which was great value for money. Our tip would be to buy tickets from the self service kiosk outside if the box office is busy.Well renovated church and a lovely way to pass time."
171,Church which leaves you  very moved.,"Hugely spectacular,  a must see in magnificent St Petersburg, good value and no queues at this time of year"
172,Most Interesting Church in St. Petersburg,This öne of the best cruch in the world if you in the st petersburg you must go there and see this amazing place
173,Amazing cathedral,"The mosaics inside are breathtaking!  Beautiful exterior is under renovation right now, but still worth the visit.  History was  made on this site with assassination of a Tsar."
174,Amazing colors and architecture,"A beautiful cathedral with incredible mosaics the main attraction. The exterior is fabulous as well, although partly under renovation."
175,Well worth paying the entrance fee,"I was so excited to be visiting this iconic building but overwhelmed by all the tourists, of which I know I was one! Unfortunately, a large group of Chinese tourists dominated the inside of the Church, taking great delight in taking selfies holding 2 fingers up✌️speaking on their mobiles and generally being loud and noisy. Shame the Russian Guide who was with them couldn't control them........It's stunning...just try and pick a time when you can appreciate the beauty and history."
176,Better then expected,It really is a shame that the scaffolding was making the beauty of the building but they have to keep it in good repair. A really majestic building that has to be seen to be appreciated. The iconic onion doom roof caps makes it stand out and easy to identify. Well worth a visit but bewarry of pick pockets and tricksters trying to sell you small items on the footpaths as soon as they see where your money is you are marked ready for the pickpockets. I understand that this is a problem in a lot of big cities but here it is much safer to buy items in a recognised souvenir shop. One thing we did not notice was any one begging however there were very pushy people try to rob you! Suitable visit for all ages and abilities.
177,"Dazzling artwork in over 23,000 pieces of mosaic tile!",An amazing building inside and out. Entry tickets are very reasonable and can be purchased on the machines outside (cash or card). Has to be seen while in St P.
178,Work of Art in 4D,This was a beautiful cathedral but long lines to enter...great for photos and just admiring by the canal
179,"A ""must see"" in St Petersburg","Church under construction.Inside is ok.However,outside,the colors are different then google pictures"
180,Not worth to pay to go inside,"I went with a guide who explained everything in great detail. Compared to the other churches I have been to where the frescoes were faded or non-existent this one has 7,000 m2 of mosaics so the colours have remained vibrant."
181,Wow!,"Beautifull mosaics all over the walls and roofs inside, but low light and crowded ground benefiting to pickpockets armed with razors that do not hesitate ripping your hags and clothes. A total shame in a religious place and a country expected to be on the vigilance side."
182,Beautiful church and compelling story,"This church now a museum is one of the most beautiful places I have seen. The outside is beautiful but do visit the inside, it will take your breath away! You can spend hours looking at the mosaics because you want to take them all in. There are no photos that capture its beauty, you have to visit."
183,A marvel to see both inside and out,One of the best Churches (musuem) I've seen in my life. Highly recommended and even more if you go with a good tour guide.
184,You will stare at this place both inside and out,"There is a long queue in Summer, even we arrive before the ticket boot open. The interior is worth to visit. I hope they will finish renovation outside the church soon. Definitely back here  again."
185,As Beautiful Inside as Out,"This church is really interesting, pay attention to the floor, it's a mosaic and each one is different. Plus the onion domes are just really cool!"
186,Wonderful,"Loved this church.  Unfortunately right now the steeple is being restored so you don't get the full view.  however, it's still amazing to see.  The inside is very cool.  The mosaics are intricate and beautiful.  You will enjoy looking through the many different mosaics.  Outside, there was nice street vendor art as well.  Highly recommend this stop."
187,Church on the Scene of a Tragedy,"This is totally unbelievable, the crypts, the history, it is all there and you can literally touch the last resting place of the Czars"
188,Great ,This is a fantastic looking church both inside and out. The inside has these big columns all painted with Biblical scenes and the outside is what you expect a Russian Church to look like
189,30 Minutes,"Very beautiful place, you should see it for 100%. Gorgeous, the best place in Saint Peterburg, I definetely come back here"
190,Beautiful and vert ornate,"Too many unpleasant tourists, crowded, souvenir stands distract and take away from the experience of enjoying an interesting church."
191,Amazing,Simply loved the mosaics in this church and went back a second time . Second time around we went after 6 pm when the entrance  cost was 400 roubles but it was worth every penny seeing the grandeur minus the hordes of tourists ..
192,Russia have gorgeous church evaaar,"Unfortunately the church spires are under repair so presently partially covered up, but when the renovation has been completed the beauty in all it's splendour will be revealed."
193,amazing decoration,"Loved both the exterior and interior. However, it is more of a museum atmosphere and doesn’t allow for prayer and reflection much. Kazan cathedral has more of a church feel to it, but the interior of this church is breathtaking."
194,Interesting building ,We visited this on Tuesday at 9pm. The place was empty which was great. I was amazed about the marble and all mosaic works. Just amazing how much can be done in the name of religion and power.
195,Super photo opportunity,I have been to many churches in my lifetime.and this church is exquisite and unique. The attention to detail and the maintenance on all the mosaic is mind blowing. A quick fit in between all the other site seeing in St Petersburg.
196,One of the best Cathedrals in the world.,"It's an incredible place, completly restored after the second world war. Full of colours, gold, blue..it's really difficult to go out.Keep attention to the people  outside with birds...they put them on your shoulders and after they ask you money."
197,Impressive and surprising.,"Entirely covert with mosaics, very impressive, enjoyed the visit although it is very crowded in summer"
198,STUNNING INSIDE & OUT,"The story behind the church needs a guide, otherwise it’s just another beautiful church. A great start towards the center."
199,Ripped off but beautiful.,"I visited late in the afternoon, spending 1.5 hours there before it closed at 6pm. The audio guide was worth doing and the mosaics and iconography in the church are beautiful. It was not so busy at that time, especially in the last 30 minutes and better for taking photos. This really is a must see sight in St Petersburg."
200,Good,Main steeple was being repaired so it was covered. I really can't enjoy this kind of place with so many tour busses and commercialisation - queues and touts outside. The building doesn't really operate as a church.
201,Wow,Amazing church from the outside and almost as impressive on the inside due to the fact it's almost completely covered by mosaic
202,Beautifully Holy,"It looks really amazing not inly outside but inside also, we were magnified by the beauty of this place and bloody story of life of Russian tsar Alexander II. Mosaics leaves a great impression and you want to come back there."
203,Must visit,"Beautiful on the outside, jaw dropping on the inside. Skip the ticket booth queue by using one of the automated machines tucked away near by."
204,Great indoors,When you stand outside and take your photos you are not ready for the inside it is the most beautiful building i have see and the 30 year wait was well worth it. Russia is everything you imagine but the inside of the buildings are move lavish than you can imagine. A must
205,Spilled Blood,Unbelievable artistry. Creating what looks like paintings inside with tiny glass tiles. Hard to believe it’s possible! Really hard to take it all in.
206,Amazing Tour,"Amazing to learn the history of this church, and to witness the beautiful art--all of which is mosaic. The amount of time and skill invested into this church is astounding. I visited with a guide so I am not sure I would have learned nearly as much from the English language signage throughout. It was March and just in the middle of coronavirus that I visited so it was pretty empty, but apparently it gets packed."
207,Imposing church,"Dear readers,We went inside and were amazed at the paintings on the ceiling. This is a very beautiful church.We were told their was a pool long time ago. When they build this church it lasted only 100 years and it broke down. It was rebuild in a few years again and still it looked old."
208,Magnificent Mosaics,A must see.. unbelievable interior.. mosaics floor to ceiling..This church was bombed in World War 11 and you can see photo of the damage and the restoration.
209,Mosaics & more Mosaics.,Very easy to lose track of time and simply look in wonder at the detail on display. Outside it looks incredible and then when you get inside . . . wow.
210,Amazing historic church,Very popular but worth putting up with crowd. Going solo could hire an audio device to talk methrough the interior and major facets of the building. Without giving away too much add it to your list.
211,Beautiful,Very pretty outside and inside. Wonderful craftsmanship especially the mosaic work. Outside colourful domes. Situated next to the canal. Well worth a visit.
212,A Must see ( but choose lowVisiting hours),a must see location - impressive on the outside but stunning on the inside with every square inch covered in mosaics . Breathtaking.
213,Breathtakingingly beautiful,"Totally a place worth visiting! This Church really is a Masterpiece of handicrafts. The history of this Church, now a Museum, is very interesting and the story about the restoration is unbelievable. The boisterous, vivid colours and ornaments, the religious pictures and the Atmosphere are almost indescribable: You just have to see and explore them yourself!"
214,"Wow, wow!","We went with Alla Tours while on a 24-hour stopover on our Norwegian Getaway Baltic cruise in August 2019. It was so crowded that we could hardly walk around! But, so gorgeously decorated inside, floor to ceiling filled with paintings, carvings, and very colorful mosaics! It is not a working church but just a tourist site."
215,Stunning!!,"A fantastic and beautiful church, the inside is fantastic, try not to go during peak hours. I wish I had gone more than once."
216,Amazing!,This was an unbelievable church! It is done completely in mosaic tiles. I would highly recommend a stop to see this!
217,Wonderful church with an incredible main hall,"Historical, beautiful, and interesting architecture and interior.  There are several thousand square meters of world-class mosaic decorations on the interior walls and columns of this church.  The church began as a shrine to Alexander the Second who died from his wounds when his carriage was bombed at this sight: thus it's popular name, Church on the Spilled Blood."
218,Beautiful building,"The church is under construction now, but we could take some nice pictures, beware of pickpockets and the guys with the traditional Russian costumes."
219,Part of a package,Beautiful mosaic work murals and serene atmosphere. you can feel the history of its place and it's one of the landmarks that should not be missed.
220,Beautifully Restored,Slightly disappointed the church was under renovation of the exterior. But still beautiful and will better after completed. Interior is beautiful.
221,An Icon Masked,Beautiful both in and out and a reasonable price to visit. Go in the week when it's much quieter and beware of the pickpockets.
222,"Crowded, but worth going anyway",Amazing church and I would recommend to visit it as early or late as possible as it can get quite busy and crowded.
223,Fantastically beautiful but crushed with tourists,"By the time we got to this church I was toured out.  But I was shocked upon entry.  While the exterior of the Church is stunning, the interior is amazing.  The Church was build on the assassination site to honor the dead ruler with everything inside made of mosaic tiles.  I was mesmerized."
224,What a magnificent church!,"An experience seeing the beauty of this place..Absolutely magnificent, and realising what WW2 did to this city, it is an absolute credit to the citizens of Russia"
225,Impressive,This church is amazing. how could an entire interior be plastered with mosaic paintings. we were truly stunned.
226,Another must see,Beautiful ornate antique church with a rich history. Worth seeing. We didn’t have a tour guide but it wasn’t necessary
227,"Tourist Hotspot - Very Busy, but Must See",Definitely worth visiting. Tickets to go inside are cheap and you can buy them at the entrance. Everything inside is decorated with impressive mosaic art. You can rent audioguide or (if you speak russian) there is a free guided tour.
228,Almost gingerbread effect,A must visit. The interior is fascinating. An art gem. Never imagined that such wonder ever existed. Crowded in the morning.
229,The church’s exterior is exquisite!,"Pictures don't really prepare you for how awesome this is, even while under renovation. Amazing architecture and colours, and the mosaics are awesome. Real wow factor."
230,Beautiful but currently under renovation ,"This is a tourist hotspot, buses coaches, taxis, traffic everywhere at the front. Long queues to get in, allow 20 mins to queue at least. Having said that, this is a must see icon. The painting inside is out of this world, very well decorated. A beautiful church everyone should visit. Once inside your visit will be around 20 mins."
231,"Stunning, inside and out","Amazing church, everything inside is with mosaic, all the walls and ceilings, such a good work and so beautifull."
232,Beautiful ,"Surely one of the city's greatest hits. The astonishing thing is that all the painted walls aren't painted at all, but the incredibly detailed images are all made up of mosaics. Countless thousands (make that millions) of coloured tiles. We were with a guide so able to queue jump, but even so it was pretty chaotic. Perhaps going out of the summer months would help - apparently tourism drops off considerable in the winter months."
233,Russian Holiday,"Bought tickets through trip advisor ahead of time. Four tickets for $24.  I picked the day of visit at that time on line. Tickets were to be emailed.  When we arrived Aug. 6, 2019, I had not received tickets so I showed them the booking page with number. They said it was not good for Aug. made me by4 tickets for over $50. I asked why I was able to select an Aug. date and they had no answer. Still can’t figure out how to get my $24 back. The cathedral was beautiful and a must see."
234,Love the mosaics,"We went to the Church with high expectation but we came away slightly disappointed.  The biggest problem is a temporary one: the current restoration works have resulted in the much of the exterior being covered up.  However, although the interior is striking (being covered in mosaics) the truth is that the quality of the art is nothing like as high as in many cathedrals and the dark interior makes it hard to view what is there.  It is also surprisingly small.  I say these things simply be manage expectations.  It is still well worth a visit."
235,"Ceiling is stunning, busy busy busy!",Very very gorgeous church in Russia and a lot of historical place which is you can learn while you visiting St. Petersburg Around the church you can find so many things and art they sell it and a lot of tourists spot and nice pictures that you can get into it....
236,Very picturesque,"The church is really beautiful, it is a must see place with a great historyThe best way to see it is to take a Chanel tour by boat and see it from the waterIn the winter time walking around is still a must do"
237,Beautiful church,"This is a well known building to most people around the world with its famous coloured rooftops/towers. It is not now used as a church but as a museum. Going inside you are treated to wall to wall opulence. Mosaics, pictures and statues all backed with guilding galore. Some of the mosaics are copies of paintings."
238,Some Places in the World You Just have to see,The beauty of the exterior of this structure is a hint to what is inside.  It is probably the most detailed and intricately decorated church in St Petersburg.  Well worth a visit if only for a few minutes and lots of photographs
239,Spilled Blood under renovation ,Amazing experience.  Beautiful architecture and gorgeous interior.Marina is a fabulous guide and we learned so much about the history of Russia and her rulers.
240,Beautiful detail,We were on a tour and went here this is a wonderful structure from the outside wish we could have seen the inside but it was amazing just to behold the structure and grounds.
241,Breath taking,"It is so beautiful inside as it is outside.  You can spend hours in there, everywhere where you look is awsomeness.  It is amazing how they got the paitings done so high up. It is really worth a visit for sure."
242,Partly hidden by scaffolding,"Very crowded, but the stunning mosaics which cover the walls and ceilings are just brilliant. The outside is also spectacular."
243,Spectacular but spoiled by ongoing work,"Visited as part of a 2 day tour with City Break Tours (find them here on Trip Advisor).  Very, very busy inside with tourists but our group had ear pieces so our Guide, Anna,could talk to us no matter where we were standing in the building.   Book a tour for these historical sites or you will miss out on so much knowledge and historical facts.  In busy times, crowds of tourists are maddening ... having a guide like Anna cuts through all of that and keeps your group informed.  You also skip the entry queues as she has booked ahead."
244,Stunning,The interior is as beautiful as the exterior! And it’s history makes it all the more special. A must visit.
245,Spectacular,"It looks much better from outside than from inside of the building. However, I have to say that it worth to see the building if you are in St. Petersburg."
246,Beautiful ,"Every church that we visited, we think that the next will be similar...each is so beautiful I'm so happy we visited them all. Wonderful artwork! Such beauty!"
247,Avoid,"We visited on a small group tour you really do need someone to explain everything to you but it was extremely busy inside & we were warned to only take a camera due to pickpockets.The ceiling and columns are decorated with mosaics of very vivid colours, turquoise being a favourite colour of Catherine's."
248,"Beautiful church, wonderfully restored",The architecture is outstanding and the interior is just amazing.  So much to see.  All set with little stones and some tombstones as well.
249,Audio Tour,So impressive a must visit! Recently renovated itt surprises you pleasantly when you enter and impresses you with the inside!
250,colorful,The murals are magnificently beautiful and the history behind this beautiful church is very interesting.
251,Historical Church,I am not a religious person. However the interior brought tears to my eyes due to the sheer beauty of the place. An exceptional building.
252,The best !,"Incredible!! Super interesting location and history. We all enjoyed our visit tremendously- including the teenage kids. Very affordable and easily accessible, well worth the visit."
253,Must see,So amazing to see these places built so many years ago. The color are amazing. Just a shame it has scaffolding around the top section at the moment.
254,Exceeded my expectations!,"As a building the church doesn't fit in with the rest of the city rather OTT and out of place from the classical buidlings elsxewhere, but interesting. Inside dark and gloomy and over crowded. The mosaics are interesting but not unmissable."
255,"Wow, too bad it's raining dogs and cats in Sept",Spectacular architecture with a most elaborate interior.The colours and extravagant decor took your breath away. The name of this magnificent Church arose from its location on the actual spot where an earlier Head of State was assassinated.
256,Very impressive!,If you think this Church looks great from the outside then you have to go inside.  It is jaw droppingly amazing inside..
257,Amazing pictures all mosaic work.,"This iconic, former cathedral, is visually stunning from the outside. Definitely worth a look on the inside too, but it is now a museum."
258,Overrated?,"This church so amazing, colorful. I stand in front of it for 2 hours for enjoying. Beside the river, its a good place for imaging about the past, so many nice stories, tragedies and so onRecommended to see"
259,Tourleader review,The turrets glistens in tithe distance. The outside is breathtaking and the murals inside are stunning too. Well worth a visit.
260,Go inside to see the Mosaics!,This elaborate and awesome building is a short walk from the main shopping street. It won’t take long but it’s definitely worth a visit. Great photo spot
261,A nice visit of St Petersburg's iconic church,This church has amazing mosaics. I can't believe someone could spend so many hours to creat these works of arts. It is worth the time and money to see this structure.
262,over the top Baroque,"A spectacular site inside and out, the columns inside are unbelievable, the history is well worth looking into english guide books are worth while. Good photo's from across the road showing the dooms. Beware of pickpockets outside as it is very busy."
263,Great history!,"Our tour bus dropped us off at this church for about 20 to 25 minutes. We walked from the front around to the left and to the rear of the church admiringly the intricate detailing and wonderful colors. This church is based on the famous St Basil's in Moscow with it's unique design featuring the onion shaped domes classic to the medieval Russian architecture.  There is a smaller structure at the back of the church with even more intricate detailing. Before getting back on our bus we walked towards the other elevation off the Griboedov Canal to get an idea of the last side of the building. We were allowed to go inside the Cathedral, however, if you do a chance, there are fabulous mosaics inside, especially the dome. Note that there are some colorful mosaics on the outside of the church above the openings. Highly recommended as this is one of the main attractions to experience in this city!"
264,Unbelievable detail ,This is a must. The architecture and the history around this place is one of the reasons that it is on everyone’s to-do list.
265,History Before Your Eyes,Having spent a decent chunk of time in Europe I have seen my fair share of churches/cathedrals. This would rank above most in terms of it's architectural design and stunning interior mosaics. The detail and beauty of each mosaic is mind blowing particularly when you consider the man hours that must have gone into it!
266,Pass around.,As fantastic inside as out.  Late in the day is a good time because the hordes of tourists are often gone by then.
267,Stunning,"Don't miss to visit Savior on the Spilled Blood, stunning interior design and history.  pls, come a bit early to avoid a very big crown of tourists^^"
268,SIGHT TO BEHOLD,We only had time to see the exterior of this amazing church.  Yes some parts were being restored but it did not detract from the beauty.There is also a market here and access to the park.
269,Fantastic Wonder!,"Stunning architecture, simply beautiful and colorful church, crowded area, definitely worth the time."
270,Amazing world class mosaics,Astounding place to visit . Beautiful from inside and outside. Although you may find the place crowded most of the time but it definitely worth a visit. Don't miss it.
271,Beautiful building,"A visit to this memorial cathedral was amazing. The exterior was eye catching, and the interior breathtaking, with every wall covered in what looked like paintings but were actually mosaics.We paid 350 roubles for admission ( no queue at 10:45am on a chilly winter morning), and paid 200 roubles inside to get English audio guide. It was well worth it to fully appreciate the story of the assassination, from which the name is derived.The church was heated, and photographs allowed. Souvenirs were available to be purchased. Staff were friendly and most spoke English, making it easy for us."
272,Amazing!,From the outside you know that this is a special place.  The interior is equally as beautiful.  There can be lots of people but we managed to view most of it.  Well worth a visit.
273,Stunning mosaics,Full of colour with a special presence inside. Outside topical tourist shops. Nice park just on the side
274,Beautiful Cathedral,"Renovations with scaffolding on part of the outside.Stunning interior with blue and gold murals all over.Great photo opportunities.Best arrive early to avoid the crowds , ticket office opens at 10.30"
275,Not to be missed!,"Unless you are really religious I would not waste my time or money, 350 roubles, on visiting this church."
276,Gorgeous church!,Luckily our guide had our tickets as it was very busy outside with long queues. The inside was also very crowded but it's worth the effort. The whole church filled with mosiacs and marble floors..
277,Elaborate exterior,"Nice place to visit and nearby... cool to walk around, do not miss it. I went with my family and enjoyed 100%. Also nice to visit the Moscow river just 10-15min walking distance from spot."
278,Incredible church,Excellent experience. Piece of art. It was top of our priority list. Sharing some pictures from our Dec trip to St petersburg
279,Very busy here!,This is part of a 2 day action packed independent tour organised for our conference group.Of course everyone recognises the most iconic building in St Petersburg. When we got there in the late morning there was a large crowd waiting to get in. We stood around for about 30 minutes before we were given our allocated time to visit.Once inside it was a crush of tourists trying to take pictures and squashing each other. Still the interior is exquisitely ornate and breathtakingly beautiful.Definitely worth seeing!
280,Beautiful!,"Beautifully decorated church and very interesting history, well worth a visit while on a tour of the city"
281,No great experience,You’ll be amazed the moment you walk in. The art work of the mosaic is simply breathtaking. Buy your ticket in advance in popular season to avoid the queue.
282,Extraordinary sight,Just beautiful! It is as spectacular from the inside as from the outside. You just have to accept that a lot of other people have the same idea - it gets really crowded
283,Magnificent!,The place is beautiful from the inside as well as outside however it is extremely crowded. there were many people coming in at once but hardly people going out.Inside the church are explained pictures of Jesus and the virgin Mary and the material they used when building the church.
284,One of the most beautiful churches,"Highly interesting structure, inside and out.  Lots of shapes and colors blend to a spectacle; granite, marble, ceramic and lots of stuff of which I don't know the names.  Apparently built on the spot where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated.Has been restored to excellent condition."
285,Fantastic... worth a visit ,"would highly recommend a visit, allow an hour or two. it does get very crowed with large tour groops"
286,Can't miss this while in St. Petersburg,I have been to this iconic cathedral on numerous occasions and it never fails to amaze and enthral me. My favourite time of year to visit is January when the canals are often frozen and there are less people around . Having said that there is always a lovely atmosphere around the cathedral during the summer months as street traders and a market stalls bustle with visitors It really is a very special place and stands out as one of the jewels of this iconic and beautiful city
287,Incredible,"If you're lucky, you'll have sunshine and blue skies for this great photo opportunity.  Like any tourist site we went to on this two-day trip, there were very large crowds and line-ups everywhere we went.  If you have the luxury of choice and time, go first thing in the morning, and perhaps off season (or shoulder season), and not in the summer.  The crowds in St. Petersburg were the most intense of our whole Baltic cruise trip.  There is a lot going on the grounds of this site, that is fun to watch or participate in."
288,Not to be missed,Must visit place and photo shot. The area in the vicinity is also worth visiting. Nearby coffee is good.
289,Superb,The staff are very nice and the food are good price per servings. Very cool and comfy place to stay and eat.
290,Stunning Russian orthodox architecture,"its worth the 3,50 pounds you spend to get in. the colors inside are just insane. People weirdly queue up in the morning to get tickets but i don’t understand why, it’s not busy or it’s not that tickets sell out (?!)."
291,So much work to build it,"Absolutely beautiful. Stunning mosaic work and ceilings, not to be missed. This time it was in a lot of scaffolding outside but I’ve visited three years ago."
292,One of many Must-See things in st Petersburg,Colourful. Entry is ticketed but you can enjoy view from outside. Looks really nice. Esp if its sunny.
293,Beautiful but crowded,Definitely add this to your list of amazing places to see another truly breathtaking stop of architecture
294,An amazing Cathedral with an interesting history,Please enter and take in the beauty of over 7000sqm mosaic walls and ceilings. 12000 shades of colour so it will definitely blow you over. There is a reason why this place is one of the most Instagrammable. It is quite a work of beauty. I had a personal tour guide with me. They also do have the audio guides which I recommend otherwise. Must see in St Pete’s
295,Visit,"Visited this year simply breathtaking place, brilliant if you are into photography. This is a must see"
296,Amazing,"A place close to hermitage, to check during your visit, it is close to nice garden where you can take boat afterwards"
297,Amazing,"Oh my goodness, this is just amazing.  We did the guided audio tour, which we were very happy with, otherwise we would’ve been wandering aimlessly.  A visit is a must when is St Petersburg!"
298,Wow,"The beauty of this place is beyond description, would recommend a guide, It has a lot to take in. NOTE; warning signs everywhere for pickpockets, but we had no problems."
299,Must See! Amazing and Beautiful!,Seeing this for the first time took my breath away - it is quite stunning.  This is well worth a visit and also it is worth paying to see the inside.  We went in September so the crowds were a lot less and we also pre-booked so again just missed the queues.
