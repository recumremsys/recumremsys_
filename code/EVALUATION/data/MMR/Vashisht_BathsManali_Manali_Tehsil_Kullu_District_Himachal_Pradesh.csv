62,Pure water bath,"Hot springs are supposed to be good for your skin due to their medicinal properties as they are mineral enriched. Here in the Vasishta Temple complex, the hot spring water is diverted in to small public bath areas separate for men and women. The women one has a series of taps where you can bath and a small cemented pool where you can take a dip. But the place is not particularly hygienic and the spring water used does not seem very clean due to its storage condition. Also the area around the bath is very cramped, small and slippery if you are trying to walk around it.It is also very crowded and so early mornings or late evenings are the best times to come here if you intend to bath. Also bring in a change of clothes. It is at a distance of about 5Kms uphill from the Manali Mall and so it is best to use an auto or taxi to come here. Visit the temple complex next to the bath and enjoy a small meal or snack around the area once you are done with the bath."

Especially in the months of Sept-March when it's less crowded. The summer months host a lot of people, so I personally don't like to go to the common bath. The temple is clean and so is the bath because of running hot water from the hot springs. There is a separate bathing area for men and women. It is an excellent way of relaxing and calming the aching muscles after a long day of walking on slopes or cycling (if you're an enthusiast)! Overall, I'd say plan your day and make it exhausting. Then go to Vashist temple to relax in the evening in the summer months. ---------------------or--------------------Visit in the winter months when there's so much snow that the pipes in homes/homestays are blocked.

124,Vashisht Temple Ram Temple Shiva temple and Hot springs,"The temple is beautiful, a fine example of wooden architecture. The warm bath makes for a perfect place to start your day.  There was no proper place to keep my camera and stuff when going for the bat, so you need to take care of that. I walked back from the temple and it was one of the best things I did in Manali. The stretch is not crowded, and it has the view of Beas on it's right."

134,Waste of time. ,In a chilly evening when you are shivering with cold.  You see so many people taking a dip in this hot spring. And you feel why are they doing such a thing?  Surely it's faith that make them do such things.The sight of so many people bathing together in such a small place is surely not good. And i was told there are no proper arrangements to change after the dip. The authorities have  put a few taps where the hot water keeps flowing and the local use it for their daily chores such as washing clothes and utensils. And yes the water is very hot if you touch it in one of those ever flowing taps.
135,Nothing extra ordinary,"I had gone in June end of the month. Already weather is hot this time. So no need to take bath in hot water. But in normal or cold season, it's natural gift. We touched water, it was really hot. Temple place and structure also look good. In ladies section, they made a pond like place where ladies take bath."
136,Great past but poor present,It's a place about 5 km from mall road and basically it's a hot water bath place. It is believed that someone once shot an arrow on ground and it got into earth so deep that it opened a way to hot water to flow out.
137,Temple was blocked for renovation in april,Historical temple dedicated to Guru Vashisht. Sulphur springs water are said to cure many disease.  A word of caution pungent smell of sulphur may cause nausea or headache to some people.
138,For the faithful and the unfaithful..,Nice place to take bath here. Spring is pleasantly hot in accordance to the cold weather. Remember to take a towel with you. The temple is just beside the spring.
139,Bevare of frauds (sparu animal blanket),its very old temple. Currently maintenance of the temple is going on. Two seperate hot water kund for girls and boys.
140,great experience.,"Visited this historical place with friends in last year. During our visit, Temple renovation work is going on. There is a natural ‘Hot Water Kund’ to bath. There is also another two-three small temple to visit. Parking is available there which is half km away from main temple."
141,Beautiful place,It was very good expeirence to have a bath in vashisht baths and the water was very very hot and it took me 30 min to get inside.Lovely trip to vashisht bath. We took a tuk-tuk from manali mall road to vashisht bath and back by walk.Lovely tripHappy journey to all!!
142,Amazing hot water spring,This place has nice wooden architectural temple. the road leading to it has lots of shops with chery and handicrafts.
143,"""Must have""Dont underestimate the power of this place",Everyone says when you visit Manali you need to visit the Vashisht Baths. They're just man made thermal baths and due to religion men & women can't bath in the same bath. Not ideal when there's one girl in the group!! Better things to see in Manali!!
144,Rama temple ,"Went with my family, the male members spend around 1 hour and they felt so rejuvenated after the bath. Female area- I wouldn't recommend for those who can just go nude and wash and change before every other(female)"
145,Sping water ,Its amazing to see how nature can pro ide almost boiling water at an area which is covered with snow most of the year. Its a great place to relax with separate baths for men and women. Women who may find seeing other women topless as offensive can avoid the bath.
146,Hot Springs and Temples,"The most notable thing about this attraction, is the breath taking view around. The backdrop of tall white mountains is just like a world that we can only dream of. There is a market around which is interesting too. The temple as such has a lot of history. But for a casual traveler, its just an old wooden temple. The most famous thing about this temple, is it's hot water bath. Now don't rush to get you towel and swimming trunks . It's a  small tank big enough to fit 3-4 people. The water temperature is warm. Not hot. I didn't like the sight of myself bathing in that small tank with 2-3 people already floating around. So I skipped it. If you feel like it, do take a dip. In all, this point is just OK to visit. Nothing too wow about it. I do give my word. The journey is worth your time. Can't say the same about the temple . You can decide yourself. Thanks."
147,"Hot water spring , wooden temple .",The temple is good but i found the bath  average and small. Just make sure when you visit vashisht do not forget to  trek to the beautiful jogini falls.
148,Pious bath,"Within the Vishnu temple complex is this hot sulphur bath. Most people just sit on the edge of the bath and dangle their feet in the water, but if you want you can completely submerge. There is a seperate men's and ladies bath. Just above these baths is another temple, forgotten whether it was Rama or Shiva!!Well worth a visit"
149,Beautiful view and Hot springs,"Situated right next to the Vashisht temple these baths are a blessing specially in the colder months. There are separate chambers for men and women. Since I have been the other natural hot water springs too, this one is much larger and well maintained compared to others. Good for people of all ages. Definitely visit here if you are in Manali."
150,Soothing experience,Nice place to visit in manali.One should not miss it.Is is only 3KM away from manali & hot watter baths are available for holly dipp
151,Good place,It is an ancient temple situated near Manali. The temple is very old and nearby are the hot water spring bath. The water is quite hot and smells of Sulfer and is said to be a cure for many skin diseases.One can have a bath there. There are different chambers for ladies and gents. But we didn't feel like going into the hot water pool. For people like us they have kept 2 taps where one has the hot steamy water and another routine tap water which is ice cold.Its fun to  experience it.
152,Serene and blissful,There are two trek starting from here one to Jogni water fall and other is to bhrigu lake.There are two different places to take bath but the water is extremely hot but relaxing if you take bath returning from the trek.
153,Rishi Vashisht Temple with Hot bath,It is a nice place to visit. There are 2 temples one is of Guru Vashisht and another one is of Lord Rama. Few Kilometers of walk is required. It has Hot water Kund separate for ladies and gents.
154,Holy temple,Very nice to see this old historical place and have a blessing of Vashisht Maharshi.  There is one Ram Mandir besides this temple which is pleasant to stay for a while.
155,Amazing,"This place is beyond temple. Being a researcher this place attracted me more than any other place at Manali. Famous for its hot water spring, this place is known to cure skin disease which in not magic but science. Infact yes, dip in the hot water spring contain sulfur which can ease some skin problems. There are separate sections for men and women and you can dip yourself freely in respective section. The temple is made of carved woods which is also very fascinating."
156,Relaxing environment,"Vashisht Temple is famous for its sulfur hot springs and a lore related to this place. according to lore, you need to take a dip in sulfur pools to get rid of your sins and pray to Vashishta.- Explore Manali's real residential area around this temple.- Parking space is limited in front of the temple and its paid.- Separate pools for Men and Women inside the temple.- Pools are usually crowded, if you don't want to take a dip you can use a tap to feel hot water.- Bring your own costumes if you want to take a dip."
157,Natural Hot water,"The place wasn't that which we expected, but if you want to have a naked hot water bath with nude people around you and you are comfortable then I would recommend you to give it a try."
158,"Divine, but water is too hot! ",Ram temple is also der alighned with vashishth old n new templeYou can read out why this temple is created at the boeard in the temple
159,Vashisht temple,"Very invigorating hot bath spring said to have originated at the place where Brahma Rishi Vashistha meditated. Laxman moved by the severe cold and snow at his guru's place, invoked the Agni arrow and shot it to the ground for a hot spring to emerge Here u can see the spot at which the Brahma Rishi meditated and the hot spring next to him. One needs to take a towel and change of clothes if intending to take a dipCan sit inside for hours Only men bath allowed here but not nude baths"
160,Visit for the hot springs and temple,The hot water spring along with the Vasishta temple is a must visit when in Manali. The place also offers breathtaking views from the top.
161,nice warm water,The temple is good for photo and it's presence. The floors are really cold and chilly and nice. But the hot springs are very unhygienic. Lots of people dip in the hot water in a really small place!
162,Hot water springs,Wow.... Here you find Naturally hot water all the time at this chilled Place. Do not forget to take a separate set of clothes when you visit there. You will love to have a bath there. MOST IMPORTANT: Separate Place is there for bath for Males and Females. PEOPLE SAY: Some people say that your skin problem may vanish after having a few dips there in that HOT water. (I am not sure of this).But You should visit this place for sure. And don't be in a hurry.
163,Natural wonders,"was there during my local site seen in manali himachal , saw very tall plats of Red Roses in nearby homes."
164,Good ,Hello friends yesterday I visited Vashisht bath located at just 3km from Manali. you can reach there in your own car or you can hire auto or taxi .himachal road transport co. has started small cab to vashisht its almost best convince to visit  there in very little fare.dnt forget to bring your towel and inner wears becouse if  you dont take bath there it useless to go there. thanks
165,good religious place,Vashisht is some 24km off Manali. People are attracted by the hot springs there for a curative medicated bath. it is all peaceful environment. Separate bathing spaces for Women and men. The Rama Temple is just next to this facility. People go there for visiting mythological temple of Sage Vashist and Lord Rama.
166,HOT BATH IN COLDEST TIME FREE,Tried Tandoor tea near the temple. Something different to try abit expensive for rs. 50 but worth.  The temple is also good. Not to mention the hot spring in -5 ° C. was thrilling
167,Place of hot water spring,Old Guru Vashisht Temple with Natual Hot spring water...before going there do not forget to take towel & clothes. one should take bath there...water is hot enough to take bath during winter also. there is separate arrangement for male & female to take bath.

169,Vashisht Temple ,"Temple is very small,  and the bath area is not maintained well.  No place to change,  and women are using soap in the baths.   It is also slippery.  Only reason to visit is the trek to jogini falls, which are spectacular."
170,Very hot,Pls. the Government should preserve this beautiful place ..by limiting the number of people. Awesome hot water bath. Cleanliness to be improved....
171,Vashisht Temple & Hot Spring,"Around 3KM from city is a temple of Rishi Vashisht, auto will take around INR 200/- from mall road. The route is steep. Separate baths are there for Ladies and Gentlemen. Ladies bath is in the temple premises, but gents bath is around 10-15 feet away from the temple. Well maintained."
172,Holy place to visit,Thor hot baths can offer you in the morning or evening hours An experience one should try to feel the local vibe!
173,gud one,The water is too dirty to take a bath in. Still it was pretty relaxing after taking the hot water bath.
174,Manali visit is not completed if not visited Vashisht Bath!!!,I enjoyed a very surrealistic authentic experimant .Very hot water. Local people are showering there
175,Hot and Cold Water Ponds,Its a very old hindu temple. Makes me feel like i am living back in pandav's era. There is also hot water pond.. which is magical in this cold hills
176,Miracles! !!,nice place to have a bath in natural hot springs.neat and clean.seperate bath for men and women.very neat and not too crowded unlike manikaran.
177,Peace of mind with warm water bath,This place  is situated away from the main manali market.  This place has to by accessed by vehicle which will leave you to the parking. From there a few metres is the temple. The temple is fully made out of wood. Just adjacent to the temple is the place where the hot water springs are believed to come.  There is a bathing area of women in the temple premises.  Water for sure is hot... Outside of this temple many locals can be seen with the rabbits.  They charge you nominally for taking photo with the rabbit.
178,Hot water spring - good to see but difficult to bathe in,Ancient temple dedicated to Rishi Vashisht. It has natural hot bath facilities - separate facilities for male and female. Welcoming behavior by local people and temple priest.
179,Something good for your eyes and heart,Vashisht baths is a very good place but to b honest i heard of it for the first time only when i visited here...It is a very good historical place to see in the heart of mountains all around...
180,Really relaxing Place,This place is very peaceful surrounded by snow-capped Himalaya. The tranquillity of the place attracts me more.
181,Nice view,Old heritage of India. Temple of great Vashist Muni with a hot water pond next to it. In addition to those you can have a nice view of mountain filled with snow on top
182,Hindu tearth ,This is the ancient temple of vasisht. The priest of Lord Rama kingdom. It's considered healthy and mental empowerment bathing in this hot spring water and relax
183,a temple with hot bath kund,"A must visit place. A holy place (kind of a hot spring), u can take a dip in it. Wprth a visit. the way to the place is lined with local market, worthy of window shoping."
184,Hot water bath,Super place to visit if u go there take bath and enjoy ... Go to Temple as well and take blessings of god vashisht ..
185,Dirty hot water,"Compared to the men's hot spring bath, the women's bath is big let down 😕. Don't get too excited ladies. However, if it is not crowded, do try and bath to enjoy the benefits of a sulfur bath. Bring a towel to dry off.It's a cool stop on the when walking up to see Jogni waterfalls."
186,Its good,Believed to be more than 4000 years old temple with beautiful architecture and wooden carvings. This temple is famous for it's hot sulphurous springs. Behind the temple there are bathhouses contain hot water from the springs which believed to have a great healing power for skin diseases. Water temperature between 40 to 50 Celsius. Through out the year it will remain the same. Separate bathhouse for women and no photos allowed. Worth a visit.
187,Temple on top of the hill with hot spring ,"We visited this place at the time our trip to Manali,This temple situated around Manali Town.Very good temple dedicated to Rishi Vashist.Adjacent Hot Water Pond is also good."
188,Miracle,"it's around 3.5 Kms from Mall Road. in between about 100-200 meters road was bad because of some construction work was going on... as a result there was massive traffic jam so i thought of walking upto this place... this was same road with goes to salong and rohtang pass. after walking around 2kms, a local guy told me not to take the road further instead take the steps which was the short cut to reaching the temple... it was bit tiring but scenic beauty was refreshing... the attraction of this place is hot water spring bath and obviously the nature's beauty...  took me around 5 hours to and fro ( including the time spent there)"
189,Very good,Hot pond is a bit smelly and area outside it is a bit unclean - authorities should look at upkeep of such a historical place
190,Kamshab,Vashisht bath is one of the most famous in manali.there was two type of kund . One is hot water kund and one is cold water kund.
191,Nice place,Nice place dedicated to Guru Vashisht and Lord Rama two separate temples besides each other... Have bathing places separate for females and males having hot water.Beware of people selling so called kashmiri woolen items around at very high prices which they latter get ready to sell at throw away price too. Must visit place.
192,Very calm and relegious place,"It's located 4 km far from Manali mall road , easily accessible by road , if you are going by car or big vehicle than you have to park your vehicle half km far from temple and need to walk to reach temple. Along with you can visit Shree ram temple . it's just beside vashisht temple."
193,it was a great place to visit,Vashist is a very beautiful village several restaurants and many chingoo shops by Kashmiris. Temples are very attractive and special. From vashist village amazing Jogni waterfall is just 45 minutes to a hour only. It's a very interesting village combination of east and west. Once must visit.
194,Vashist temple,"The temple is located a walking distance from the bus stand. Even though the place is a bit crowded the Temple is worth visiting. And do remember you don't usually see this kind of place everywhere. And for your information, Photography is prohibited inside the bathhouse, so please do abide the rules. I must say this is one of the must place you must visit in Manali."
195,OK OK,The place is at a height and we enjoyed climbing to the same. The temple courtyard is quite big and we took pics and enjoyed for almost an hour.
196,Hot sulphur bath,"Blissful place and great to witness the hot water spring at such a place where things get frozen. The place was maintained neatly. Pathway to reach the place is a bit narrow for vehicle to go but once reach the place, would love the ambience. The Ram temple nearby was also a charm."
197,Perennial hot water from mother nature,The pond is just okay but could be improved with a little care from local authorities so that it could be enjoyed by tourists - currently it is more of locals den.
198,Not a must visit,"Nice temple dedicated to Lord Vashishta, with the natural steaming hot springs nearby. You may take a holy dip in the bathing area, the water is said to be rich with many minerals and heals diseases. However, you may give it a miss if going to Manikaran.Reason1- Roads are not well maintained and narrow, we got stuck in traffic for an hour - both way.Reason2- Temple is going thru some renovation which may cause inconvenienceTo experience Hot water springs and bath, prefer Manikaran if its not in your list. If its not in the list, please add.. its worth it :)"
199,Vashisht(holy place of Maharishi Vashisht ),The temple complex and hot springs are an attraction here - some nice woodwork on the temples . Do not miss the ram temple located a few steps above.
200,Hot Water Springs,"Visited the temple with very high hopes, which were dashed after the visit.Seems temple was under renovation and may be alternate arrangements were made, even though alternate arrangements it left us feeling the visit to temple was ......"
201,Hot springs in Vasisht Temple,It is an holy place. I with my family visited here in June 2016. The speciality of this place is the hot water bath. The hot water is coming from top of the hill and get collected in a small tank. The water is very hot and it has some ancient and magical power to cure skin diseases. Every visitor should take the bath and also visit Lord Rama Temple which is very much near to Vashisht Temple.
202,Nice one,"simply go and take Hot water bhath...a great experience...water is hot and there is provision of cold water also,place is good having taps also and a large pool to take bath..i suggest u to dont miss ."
203,A nice bath,Vasisth hot water bath is about 6km from mall road Manali. U can go by car or by auto rickshaw they will charge you 150 for one side. There is problem of traffic jam nearby the main town. There you will see the temple of rishi vashisth . the temple is very beautiful with wooden carving. U can also have the view of snow laden mountains of Himalayas there There is market also u can do shopping there. U can buy the traditional cap starting from just 50ruppes. Also u can buy some good woolen cloths like traditional jacket starting from 350 ruppes
204,Hot hot hot!,"When we reached there, the site was under construction so we were not able to take bath in Kund but we did our prayer in Temple."
205,Awesome place,The temple is around 3-4 km from Manali market. The road is narrow & we had tough time with our scooty as there is steep slopes on the way.We didn't knew that there is hot spring inside separate for Men & Women as well open to all visitors. We were not prepared hence didn't get chance.There are few more temples in surround Ram Temple just opposite to this one.
206,Manali with friends,"Nothing great . No arrangements exist for taking bath in a decent way.One can visit these after having travelled to Manali, but unfortunately, these are not maintained at all.  Wish the Government H.P. could pay a little attention to develop these  as nice religious tourism places."
207,Divinity in Manali,"I visited Vashisht on my way to Jogini Falls trek. I found it to be a really crowded and hyped place. Because it is very popular and recommended by local guides, people make it a point to go there and as a result it is really crowded. More than its limited space can sustain or entertain. Also, it is nothing more than a regular Hindu temple built in a different way. So, I will not recommend it to anyone, atleast not to anyone visiting Manali for peace and quiet."
208,A vintage temple and baths,This was a Memorable Hot water bath in the Lap of Nature My My two Friends enjoyed our day some days back when we were in Manali.  It was great and enjoyable bath. Thank you god for such a beauty of this kind.
209,Vashisth Hot Baths ,"The Vashisht baths in Manali are hot water Springs that are found on the banks of river Beas. The name of Vashisht baths comes from Vashisht, the great sage who taught and advised Lord Rama. This place is surrounded by pine trees & accompanied by beautiful sandstone temples. The place is situated 6 km away from Manali & is on the way to Solang. One can hire an auto or taxi & can also cover it during local sightseeing around Manali or while returning from Solang valley.These are natural sulphur Springs, which are said to possess medicinal values that cure several skin diseases. They are connected to the Turkish style showers through pipes. One can visit the baths to revitalize their body and soul. You can take a dip into hot water springs and baths, which leave you refreshed and maybe even healthier. This area is surrounded by hundreds of small shops from where you can buy souvenirs and religious merchandise."
210,Histirical Temple,"I visited this place while doing local sight seeing in Manali. This is an old 'Vashisht Muni' temple. Adjacent to the temple is a warm water pool. There separate sections for male and female. Be prepared, if you want to take a dip in this warm (slightly hot) water pool."
211,Ancient temple and natural hot bath ,"There are two temples at the end of narrow street where you have to climb the slope. The vashisht temple is right now under maintainance. The baths made for men and women are in pathetic condition. Couldn't even think of touching the water. As a tourist, this place is just waste of time and energy. The scenic beauty surrounding is very nice...but when in manali you can experience this from everywhere hence can skip this point. The shops celling sparoo (woolen blanket) which they claim is from ladakh are also not genuine."
212,Divya Prakash,great experience at the hot water spring here in vashisht. easily. went there by own vehicle. parking is very difficult to find. so preferably take a walk.
213,nice place for the hot springs,Vashisht temple is a beautiful and rather rustic place. The temple of Vashisht here build around the hot water spring is obvioudly quite old. It has been beautifully renovated with detailed and striking carved wood - Devdar (the local species of Cedar).Worth a visit as it is a short drive away from Manali city.
214,Natural Baths,"It's a historical Vashisht temple,which has natural sulphur hot spring baths.There's a separate facility for men n women.The water was really hot,though,must be around 40°.It's highly therapeutic and relieving. So,worth a dip.When you come out of the temple,there's an amazing Tandoor Kullad tea available,which feels awesome after a hot dip."
215,A historical place,Another temple on top of a small hill.To reach there you have to ascent the hill through narrow by lanes.Though the vehicles go to top but there is a parking place about half km before the temple.The temple’s architecture is really beautiful and also not so crowded. The view from the temple is beautiful.There are two bath places for Gents & Ladies adjacent to temple. Another two small temples are also there.
216,Very Clean and well maintained Temple,"nothing much to do here , it has its religious and heritage value but as a tourist its just  ok ok place"
217,Just alright,"I visited the place in the first week of June, with my family. There are two temples namely Vashisth temple and Ram temple. Presently, renovation is going on at Vashisth temple, hence you have the view of the Idol from a distance. However, the architecture of both the temples are very attractive with background of mountain view.The approach road and the surroundings of the temple is congested but so is  majority of the temples during peak tourist season.There is a place at the entry of Vashishth Temple where you can leave your shoes and roam around the temples and take a bath at hot water 'Kund'. Two separate ' Kunds' are available for Ladies and Gents. Ladies 'Kund' is cramped due to confined spaves, however gents 'Kund' is perfect to take a bath. But, you can not immidiately take a dip into the 'kund' because of the high temperature of water, one has to adjust with it gradually.  Another method can be adopted to get into the water from the side where cold water is being mixed or using a mug to mix hot and cold water and pour over head.Overall a must visit for people visiting Manali."
218,Take a Bath in the hot spring water,"Visited mid june, the water temp was slightly on higher side but worth... reached after a long trek of almost 10 kms... so was tired... didnt take a bath but dipped my legs for 5-7 mins and it worked just enough to help me relax... nice place overall.."
219,Well maintained,A compact ashram which gives a glimpse of great indian history. can spend an hour here. hidimba temple is bigger and more serene then this one
220,Sulphur water for your skin and bone treatment  ,"very rustic and charming hill top temple. A small walk to the temple may be requried. three temples, one each of Shiva, Ram and Vashist are there. At the Vashist Temple, you will find two bathing places flowing with hot water of right temperature. I visited, but did not take bath."
221,Rishi Vashishth,"Vashisht is comparatively less crowded and this is a must visit place in manali. 3.5km form main manali is this beautiful vashisht temple with hot spring (very hot actually), but after a long walk or tiring journey, one should take bath and see the effect. Its very very relaxing. Separate section for ladies and gents. Must must visit. Try local german bakery nearby.Note: Hire local auto from new manali to vashisht hot spring (local-10 rs/pp). Outsiders (20-25 Rs./pp) depending on season."
222,HOT WATER SPRING,This ancient temple is one of the most revered by the local. People come from far and wide to bathe in the natural hot water springs to rid of many health problems. The place is divine. The adjoining Ram Temple is beautiful as well. But must beware of the shops lining the road upto the temple selling Kashmiri Soparus. Absolute bogus that.
223,Amazing!,"It's great to visit the Vashisht Temple and experience the natural hot water baths...Must visit for every traveler to Manali.. After a relaxing bath at the hot water bath, head to this little unassuming 'Sujan Cafe',  just 10 metres from the Vashisht Baths for some freshly made piping hot momos, chowmein, tea or pakodas. Definitely try their 'Spinach and Cheese Momos' and 'Onion Spinach Pakodas'.. They're too yummy as the owner Mr. Himanshu and his Chef, Champa (seen in pic) make it with fresh ingredients grown in their backyard and a lot of passion thus churning delicious mouth licking dishes for any palate. A must visit for a foodie / visitor to Vashisht."
224,Hot water springs.. Sulphur Baths..,Visited on May 2019.Guru vasistha was Guru of Lord Rama and is named after him. Currently temple was under construction and idol can be seen from bit far. Hot water spring facilities are closed for Women when we visited temple.From parking we need to climb bit up to reach temple and need to climb bit more to reach hot water spring pond for men.Market is very costly when compared to Manali Mall Road
225,Temple of Rama's Guru,"One of the popular temples in Manali, it was relatively a small (if you feel compelled to compare with temples of grandeur) but beautiful temple thronged by tourists and visitors. One of the specialties here is the natural hot springs inside the temple premises which have been converted into hot baths for men & women separately.If you visit Manali, do visit this temple too."
226,Hot spring in Manali,"Vashisht Baths are hot water springs, situated on the banks of the gurgling Beas River in the picturesque hill station of Manali. Very good place."
227,Extremely crowded,The temple is a small one with restricted entry to the main area. There is a Rama Temple just next to this. The way to go there is steep and you should park your cars in the lower area to avoid getting stuck in traffic (This is very important). From there you can walk up to the Bahs. There is a hot water spring here which you cannot miss. It is truly an experience which should not be missed.There are separate areas for Men and Women and oone should make sue that you take a dip in the hot water. Once you do you will never want to come out. It is one of the most soothing things I have ever done in my life.
228,ancient place love to go,"Perhaps the only temple dedicated to sage Vasisth, this temple in Manali has a hot water spring  which constantly has hot water even in the cold climate. People take bath in it and there is a separate provision for ladies"
229,Holy Hot Water,"Something good for your eyes and heart, something you cannot find in city jungles, it was a great time with friends , something historic and ancient, memories of a beautiful world, it’s not somewhere from out of the world , but you’ll have that satisfaction feel."
230,heritage value,Hot spring bath.. its a must visit place. It's been said any kind of skin or body problem can resolved. They have Turkish hamam style bath. when we visit there were none so we enjoyed for long.
231,Overrated,It was a very peaceful place. We visited twice. In the morning - it was serene and enjoyable - however in the evening - it was crowded.  Overall - worth visiting.
232,Hot water springs,"I visited this Temple with two friends. Earlier, I visited with my sister. The wood work, the calm Pandit ji, the Hot Water bath, everything is mesmerizing"
233,Much hyped!,vashisht baths basically having a very ancient temple of rishi vashisht  .there are hot springs where devotees can take bath seperated for both man and women.
234,Not Well Kept,"God's have given us the prime gift to enjoy the prime of all things especially here in HIMACHAL PRADESH, know to be as Gods Own Country. When I visited this place the temperature outside was -4 I was owerloaded with all sorts of warm dress to  save my self. The time I reached inside the bath I was seen by the people that if I have come from Antarctica. Rest the pictures will show you"
235,An experience one should try to feel the local vibe,"this is my second hot water spring experience. there is a small pool just by the temple, and another one just 15-20 m above. since the pool by the temple is always crowded, i would recommend everyone to visit the one above, which is mostly empty. its one the most refreshing experiences i have ever had."
236,enjoyed and photoshot a lot,One of the oldest temple located in the city. Here you can find more Israeli tourists and most restaurants serving Israeli dishes.
237,Visit for Vashsisht Baths,"Yes we go there for a Holy Deep ..BUT THE LOCALS TREAT IT AS A FREE toilet/ bath room, they come with bucket of old cloths to be washed and they bath as thou they have not bathed for weeks scrubbing each other. and we have to wait and wait untill i have to ask them when will they FINISH. I  wish the temple management will do something about it...Its a historic temple and A SAGE CALL VASHIST and this how they traet the HOLY WATER. ANYWAYS IT DOES not STOP me going as my focus was only on the divine."
238, Not maintained well,"This is an interesting temple, along with natural hot spring baths.The baths are enclosed, with separate rooms for men and women.The water is hot, HOT! I frequent hot pools regularly and found this water too hot to sit in for more than a minute or so.The baths were very busy, but still an enjoyable experience.One note - in winter, the traffic congests on the way up and down the road, and it can take up to an hour each way."
239,One of the must visit in Manali ,"So we were off to see the vashisht temple and never had heard of the baths but eventually when we got there we saw these. People were bathing in it and everything, its like a hot spring in the middle of all the snow. It was my first time to see something like this and it was nice. The water was really hot."
240,Enjoy hot springs,"The hot spring bath is amazingly rejuvenating. The entrance is from within the vashisht temple. The water is very hot. It's at the tipping point between comfort and burning. Try not to move a lot in the water and you'll feel really comfortable. As a bonus, the water contains more sulphur which is supposedly good for the skin.To reach there, its preferable you leave the vehicle at the bottom of the ascent to the top, it's about a 1km walk. This will help you prevent traffic jams.Might like to add that it might not be too comfortable for women - in that the women taking the bath are fully nude. Men dont have to worry as all men wear shorts or underwears."
241,Holy bath!!!!,"The highlight of this temple is the antiquity of the idol of sage Vasisht which is set to be thousands of years old. There is a big hoarding which gives the history of this place, but sadly it is only in Hindi which is a big negative for those who do not know the language. Don't miss the hot water spring nearby. A dip in this is said to cure skin problems."
242,Hot springs & temple complex,"Although a mostly crowded place, having a hot bath in sulphur springs, especially when it’s quite cold outside, is one of the most relaxing and appealing experiences. Men and women are segregated. You need to go prepared with a towel and briefs to wear during the bath. There’s neither any arrangement to keep clothes or belongings, nor changing rooms available so you’ll need to have someone outside manage this and take turns to get into the bath. There’s some flotsam in the bath (obvious, with so many people getting in) that’s a bit disconcerting till relaxation drives everything else out of the mind. Towels are available in nearby shops if you forget to carry yours."
243,MUST VISIT,vashisht baths are very soothing for a trekker after a long trek from various trekking points ion and around Manali.The hot baths provide ample relaxation to the mind as well as the body.worth a visit.Not so far from main market can easily be reached by an auto rickshaw.Highly recommend from my side.
244,Hot water spring,"When you visit this place you can park your car in any of the parking lot nearby. There are paid parking lot with just 2/3minutes walk to the Baths or free parking lot 5minutes from the Baths.Even if you are parking in free parking lot it’s a busy street right up to the Baths up the hill. Souvenirs shops walled to the lane which takes you to the spot. So many jewelry shops as well if you are interested in beautiful silver jewelry. I picked a few from here and they are outstanding. There are stalls which sells food, restaurants for dine in, and also you are fond of sour stuff like raw mango, tamarind, and many other junkies that can be found here in this lane.When you get in the premises, you are supposed to remove the footwear outside and the care taker charges 2/5rupees for the same.The Vashisht Bath, a water body which is natural Sulphur spring is believed to possess medicinal values for skin related ailment. These are connected to the premises through pipes in separate section for men and for woman. The bathing area section has photography prohibited inside to respect the privacy.Its kind of a very small place for bathing but you can visit the place for its charm and dip your toes.This place is also a scenic tourist spot as it offers beautiful panorama especially sunset hour. Make a note of the opening and closing hour of this place before you plan your visit.This rating is based on overall experience here, not just the monument!!don't get disappoint by seeing the monument, enjoy the surrounding as well..."
245,A definite must go,"Approach is not easy. There are two parkings - one close to the temple and spring and the other far away. If you get the far away parking, be ready for a steep climb. Though not very tiring - it can be cumbersome with young kids. The spring itself is interesting enough, but there is usually a number of people trying to bathe and that makes it feel a little unclean and unhygienic to use..."
246,A very hot spring,must visit...good wooden temple..we come to know about history of place...about vasistha muni...hot water bath and spring...fantastik...near by market lot of local woolen stuff available..
247,hot water bath in cold weather,"A nice peaceful sightseeing spot in Manali. Although we didn't opt for the Hot Water Bath, but we enjoyed our time there."
248,Awesome backdrop. Interesting market around. Not so enticing when it comes to bath.,"Vashisht Baths are hot water springs, situated at village- bashisht, on the banks of the gurgling Beas River in the picturesque hill station of Manali,Himachal Pardesh. These baths are named after the great sage Vashisht, who was a teacher and adviser to Lord Rama. Surrounded by pine trees and luxuriant vegetation, these water bodies are natural sulphur springs, which are believed to possess medicinal values and can cure several skin related ailments. Elegant Turkish style showers, which are connected to the springs through pipes, are fitted here for the convenience of visitors. While on a Manali tour, soak yourself in Vashisht Baths to revitalise your body and soul."
249,Hot spring!!!,One needs to walk a few hundred meters of gentle slope from the common parking area with shops on either side of the road!The temple was under renovation and we could only see the Vashist idol from a distance.Hot water spring is inside the women bathroom and I could not see the spring.We could offer prayers at the adjacent ancient Ram Temple.
250,Nice Temple having warm water falls.,"This place caters equally to the faithful, with its beautiful temples and hot water baths as well as the unfaithful with its scenic beauty and shopping centre."
251,Excellent,We went to Vashisth Temple in April 2017. It is an ancient temple - one of its own kind. Hot water pond is the major attraction in the temple compound. Nearby there are other two temples - Lord Shiva and Lord Rama. Place is commercialized with local merchandise. But still a must go place.
252,Very Relaxing,Vasishth Ashram is having two temples one shiva temple and another Vasishth temple .The temples are made of wood.There is hot water kund in vashisth temple separate for ladies and gents. people take bath for medicinal reason.
253,Natural hot water springs,Take sometime and spend in the bath......its magical water full of medicinal properties.....We went there in hurry thinking there wont be much but as we entered the water felt like all our tiredness was gone.A must visit .... pls. take your time and pay visit.
254,Holy temple with hot spring water,"The Vashisht temple and bath is located at a distance of about 3 kms from Manali. There are 3 temples in total. Apart from Vashisht temple there is a temple dedicated to Lord Ram and the other one is of Lord Shiva. Once upon a time this was place for meditation of Vashishta Maharshi. When Laxman came to take help of Vashishta muni for Ashwa megha yaga, he fired an arrow to the ground from where hot water spring gushed out to warm up the cold place. Till now there is a belief that the water here is having medicinal values. That is true beacuse of the Sulphur content.Separate enclosed bathing provision for women is available."
255,Natural hot water in cold climate,"They have two small temples, and there is a hot water spring. Besides this, there is nothing much to see or experience. Not sure about peak season, but not worth unless you really want to take a hot water batch here."
256,Hot Bath,"Beautiful temple,and a lot of restaurants and too many shops for shopping.I think two or three temples are around this place.There you can see all the wooden carvings and very interesting things around the temple."
257,Hot water springs,"Considered to be a holy place, the Vashisht Bath is a place thronged by locals and foreigners alike. The idea of community bathing is a bit odd for many however, one can take a holy dip in the hot waters and 'cleanse' themselves."
258,Good place to visit,vashisht temple and bath is situated just out side the Manali mall road on a hill top . Its a very Old Wooden temple of great religious value . We paid our worship and explore the area . Since it was very cold we skipped the idea of taking bath in Hot Spring . Separate area of bath for ladies and gents . Out side the vashisit Temple you also have Ram mandir and mahadev mandir . Its a good market area to explore local handicraft and cloths . Kids can take picture with Rabbit and Sheep which is really liked by the kids .There is a parking area so you have to walk less than 100 m to the temple .
259,Naturally Hot water all the time at this Chilled Place,Very well located..It is must visit place at manali..approach may be a problem...Old person can avoid..
260,Not maintained,"If you are in Manali, you must visit this temple enroute your trek to Jogini Falls. And if you can spare time for a warm-spring water bath in this temple, it would be therapeutic. Carry a towel and a spare pair of inner-wear though.There are different enclosures in the temple compound for bathing of males and females."
261,Beautiful hot spring,Words are not enough to describe my experience about hot spring bath at Vashisht.... I am already looking forward to my next trip to Manali... especially for hot spring bath..... How i wish i lived somewhere closer so that i could take a dip everyday at mighty Vashisht hot spring.... I was so much moved by this place that i ended up writing a blog on Hot spring bath at Vashisht... Highly recommended...
262,"Very hot water, a nice place to visit",This is a very ancient temple dedicated to maharishi vashisht. Roads are very narrow and traffic jam is common. There are two separate hot water ponds for men and women.
263,Hot water springs,"Vashisht is a sort of hippie village about two kilometres north of Manali. Here families can bathe in the hot springs and visit the numerous temples, while the foreign tourists mainly come here for the ease of finding charas. You have to climb to the top of old Manali to enjoy real old villages with wooden houses covered with slate. A temple dedicated to Manu, the first man according to Hindu legend, stands in this place"
264,Mandir have Historical great value,I visited there in the month of jan this year .i was amazed to see the snow everywhere as there was a huge snowfall those days.and then from the shivering winter outside one goes to take bath in the holy hot water spring of vashishta.It is said that this water has the healing powers and even it gives a relaxation .it feels like we are getting enery by taking bath .Then we come to temple to take blessings of maharishi vashishata.Awesome experience
265,Hot water,"Vashisht is a very small village located at about 4 Kms from Manali across the River Beas. This village is very famous for its sulphurous Hot Springs and Vashisht Temple. The Hot springs water is believed to cure skin diseases and infections. Vashisht was named after Rishi Vashisht one of the seven sages of Hindu. There are separate bathing arrangements both for men and women. It is said that bathing place for women is not clean. Apart from Vashisht Temple, there are temples of Lord Ram and Lord Shiva. At present renovation is going on at this temple and donations are being accepted.There are lot of shops in Vashisht selling woollen clothes and Toy items.Vashisht Temple at Vashisht is a must to see at Manali."
266,spiritual place,"Manali is one of the best places I've been. Meet with some awesome people there, if ur couples try to use bikes coz there are so many cars around n it jams d road. Also one thing if u wanna buy leather jacket contact 9816166160 this guy has genuine leather jackets in front of Buddhist monastery. In other shops I'll get a fake jacket for 600rs...For bikes contact (scooter rentals manali- 9816076854) best bikes well maintained avg is good.... Watch out for ""sparu scam"" near jogini waterfalls area market place."
267,spiritual place,Visiting Vashisht kund is pure waste of time. Nothing special over here. Currently the kund is under repairs and hence entry isn't allowed. Yet there are no such signboards displayed at the drop off point for taxis. There is a steep incline narrow road to be taken to reach the top only to be left totally dissatisfied and let down. Can avoid totally.
268,Guru Vashisht Temple,"This is just one of the many attractions in the busy alpine village of Vashisht, a steep mountain climb from new Manali by taxi, tuk tuk or even walking if you are feeling that energetic.  The village is full of shops and bazaars, but prices are somwhat higher than those found in New Manali, down in the valley below."
269,Hot water spring,"The Vashisht village is 6 km from Manali at the banks of the Beas River opposite Old Manali. Vashisht is reachable from Manali by half an hour walk or a short drive up a slanting road.The Vashisht temple which exists even today is believed to be more than 4000 years.Vashisht temple is built in a traditional style with lots of intricate wood carvings. It is also most popular for hot springs which is believed to have medicinal value. There are separate bathing arrangement for men and women.But the water is very unhygienic. It's a matter of faith & curiosity to check out hot water bath /spring that bring people to this place. Lot of foreigners are staying in the vicinity for long duration.I could see signs on restaurants offering Israeli & Italian cuisine to cater to this crowd.overall, go if you must."
270,Holy place,"First off all there is no animal named sparu,and sellers from Kashmir will tell you it is a rare animal and you are extracting wool from it and recycling it, actually the gorvernment has banned the sale of this but they still sell this tell it is have a government scheme and you will 75 % when you return it,one big scam.i have ordered it for 2000 as adavance and left 5000 on arrival but it hasn't arrived yet it's been 4 monts and non of the contact number on their card is correct,their shop name is shivam haldoom house.the price range from 8000-60000 many innocent tourists are fooled everyday still government is not taking any step, I have their bill and the sellers photos."
271,Nice for a visit + beware of foreigners not respecting the place,Vasisht temple is known as a place where Maharshi Vasisht began mediating and vowed to start his life anew after the river refused to kill him while trying to commit suicide when his children were killed.  Vashisht temple is built in a traditional style with lots of intricate wood carvings. It is also most popular for hot sulphur springs which are believed to have medicinal value. There are separate bathing arrangement for men and women. One has two walk uphill through narrow by lanes to reach this temple.
272,Small and Crowded,"If you’re a couple, don’t plan this to be a romantic dip, men & women baths are separated. The water is pretty funky & full of floating skin? Or something that looks super gross? But the water is nice after a trek, taps to rinse off after so you can bring soap. It felt dodgy haha but relaxing & rejuvenating when my eyes were closed."
273,"its very crowded, can be missed.","Not to be missed is the town's hot sulphur spring, where the water temperature is variable from day to day, from warm, hot, very hot or boiling hot. Believed to have medicinal value it is beneficial for hair and skin too. It's useful to bring your shampoo and plastic jug. A relaxing 15-20mn daily bath during my long stay at Vashisht. Free entrance."
274,Hot springs in cold,Rushi vashisht who have also written about goddess durga. The temple represents culture of North himachal and hot spring /water are evident enough to discribe the importance of the place as it is not seen everywhere
275,Guru Vashishth,Vashisth hot water baths are adjacent to the ancient Vashisth temple on a hillock close to Manali town. Approach is through narrow roads with steep climb which is congested with people and vehicles. It is miracle how people access this wonderful place. Separate enclosures for bath is maintained for men and women. Water is very hot and considered to be medicinal. Lot S of people take dip in the hotel ponds here.
276,Worth a visit,This place is in Manali in Himachal Pradesh.This is the temple of Lord Vashisht . One can experience natural baths at this place as their are hot water pools which are naturally their .Good Place and easily accessible
277,vashisht temple,Hot water was coming from the underground while the external temperature was zero degree Celsius.  It was really a miracle for us.
278,hot bath,The Vashisht baths in Manali are hot water. The name of Vashisht baths comes from Vashisht. Man and woman separate bathroom. Must visit...
279,A must visit in Manali,VASHISHTA ASHRAMA is the place where sage VASISTA  lived.This temple has a BEAUTIFUL wooden image of SAGE VASISTA and there are HOT WATER KUNDS (bath ) here and they have medicinal value.
280,Jai shri ram,"Very popular with the locals and busy in evenings after their day’s work, yet I still found the soaking experience quite pleasant and relaxing though it was usually a bit crowded when I went in the evenings. Water is probably cleaner early mornings, and is sometimes a wee hot. Nice experience to visit the local temple for a healing bath."
281,Average,"1. Vehicles can go right upto the temple parking but taxi drivers prefer to drop you at the base and make you want.2. Avoid the ""chingu"" or ""sparoo"" agents who spring out of shops enroute the temple. It seems that this is a scam in these parts and it's just a waste of time.3. The couple of temples up there on the hills are worth the effort no doubt as there is nothing else to do at Manali after you have enjoyed the snow and the views"
282,Its nothing that great place,The Temple of Guru Vashisht the Teacher of Shree Ram ji. An Ancient temple dates back to RAMAYANA era.
283,Good Place,The temple is dedicated to Rishi Vashishth (maybe one of its kind). Its a small temple with wooden carvings and traditional architecture. There are hot water springs to have a bath. Worth a visit.
284,The women's bath is disappointing ,Its one of the most iconic places to visit. But please beware that there is a steep road you need to climb. so if you are visiting with elderly people be cautious. Once you are there the Guru Vashisth Kund is a must for few minutes. It will surely give you relief from your pain.
285,Hot water kund,A quaint construction after a steep walk. The location is absolutely stunning so a definite must-go if you are in Manali and don't mind driving around to explore a few more places.
286,Beat the cold,"An old temple with a modern structure that mars its beauty. There are two separate enclosures, one each for men and women in the hot spring baths. Enthusiasts love it but the place is crowded and not well kept."
287,Best hot spring ,"Nice calm atmosphere in the temple..... Although under construction, yet provides peace of mind.....Hot water bath is also available for tired tourists. Overall the temple premises are good.However the main show starts outside. NEVER EVER think of even buying anything from the market shops, especially the handloom houses all around. They will tell you a very beautifully organised realistic tale and befool you into buying their product. But never trust those words. We have been a prey of their SCAM and we completely understand how it works. They will tell you a story about some species called CHINGU or CHEERU or SPARU(all same...... In real it never exists😂😂)from which they make blankets that KEEP U COOL IN SUMMER AND VICE VERSA. They provide you with many gift blankets as well and tell you that they will allow us to hire the main item(blanket) for 21 months to 5 years and after which someone will come and take back that blanket and return some 90% of the money we pay, but we will be allowed to keep the gifts that was provided alongside. All these stuff seem to attract the visitors who fall into the trap and later all those words only prove a lie😂🤣. You will find a lot in the internet about this CHINGU SCAM. My strong suggestion..... Please please never ever fall into the scam and be cautious as they r too clever to wind about the customer with their lies."
288,Found by chance.,"Atleast once in your life you have to visit this place with your wife or frineds or Family and you not gonna forget there memories, places and Environment."
289,Kund,"The place is known for its hot springs. Although I didn’t go in, the people with me who went in loved the hot spring. You can even have a bath in there. There are different places for women and men. And yes there are a few fools who came and washed clothes out there and were chided at! So yea good for a foot soak!"
290,Bath time,"Vashisth is nearly 3 km away from Manali Mall Road. An old Kullu architecture based temple of Rishi Vashisth was there. Natural hot springs were also there. The natural hot springs are small in comparison to Manikaran Sahib. Pool size is much less and many people are generally present in the pool at any time. Worth visiting if you had not visited Manikaran earlier or having no plan to visit there either. If you are in Manali and have sufficient time, may visit this place."
291,How to have a perfect time in Vashist temple!,The temple is believed to be 4000 years old.The” Rishi Vashist” is Kula  guru  of Lord Rama.The black stone image of Vashist adorns the temple.The temple has beautiful wood carvings.There is Rama temple in the premises.For hot water baths prefer manikaran.
292,Natural Sona Bath,"I went to Vashisht Baths. While most temples will leave you spiritually rejuvenated, there are a few where you can take a dip into hot water springs and baths, which leave you refreshed and maybe even healthier. It is great place to go."
293,well maintain temple,"Visited this famous Vashisht Temple (named after Rishi Vashisht, one of the seven Hindu sages) which is decorated with excellent and beautiful carvings on wood and is almost 3.5 km. from Manali in Feb'19. The Vashisht Hot Water Spring is one of the famous attractions of this region. The sulphurous hot springs is believed to have medicinal value and believed to cure many skin diseases. Many people go to the Vashisht baths to take a dip and rid themselves of skin infections and diseases while seeking blessing from the presiding deity of the temple. There are also separate bathrooms for both men and women, fitted with showers. The timings for Vashist Temple are 7 am to 9 pm and for baths are 7 am to 1 pm and 2 pm to 9 pm on all days. Guest houses are available for long stay (1-4 months) usually preferred by foreign tourists."
294,Hot water Kund,"During our visit, the place was quite crowded and the waters were literally being over-used. You'll need a walk uphill for around 200 meters as cars are not allowed beyond a certain point"
295,Must Visit Place,"The multi-crore market of chingu, a blanket which Kashmiri shopkeepers claim to be made of feathers of a rare animal,""No such animal exist, is making hundreds of tourists the victim of fraud daily. Having no fear of the police, Kashmiri shopkeepers have spread their network in Vashisht, old Manali, Dhungari and Manali.Don’t buy any kind of blanket in Manali n it’s not from Kashmiri n the original price of blanket is ₹750 max and we did lot of negotiations they are ready to give for but we didn’t not took.Don’t buy Kesar in road side it’s not kesar If you visit there try to negotiate n they may sale for ₹50/ pcs seriously we did n but we didn’t purchase. They ready sell kesar for ₹50 / small box"
296,Holy vashist,"It was a crowded place, having a lot of associated history.There was nothing more special. Can do this attraction in an hour or so max. Note that to reach the temple area, there is significant slope to climb from the parking area."
297,A good place to visit,"Best service, with excellent behaviour.You should visit here once and for sure you will visit again and again."
298,Unique and Hot,"Was glad to find some onsen here in India, the existence of which was a surprise to me. The facilities are very simple and austere, but since it’s free I can’t complain. Highly recommended if you’re in the area. Just be careful to reserve a return trip back to Manali if going at night by taxi or tuktuk as there are few stationed in Vashisht after 9pm or so. The road back to Manali is also precarious at the moment due to construction and walking back at night is not for the faint of heart."
299,Something one must visit,Nothing more than a waste of time and energy. Plan to go here only if you have nothing else to do on your trip to Manali and have excess energy to spend on climbing the slope through the narrow market lane.This place features in all travel guides and tour itineraries provided by tour operators as it gives them an additional point to quote in the plan. You can safely skip this place without regrets.
