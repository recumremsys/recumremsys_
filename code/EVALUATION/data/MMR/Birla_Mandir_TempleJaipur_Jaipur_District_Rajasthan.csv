Laxmi Narain is the main deity.It's Not on an elevated hill point (sometimes can be confusing like being on hill top; as right above this temple, there is another, that one can sight atop a hill besides an old Fort).

188,Birla Mandir,"This white marble temple is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. My husband and I had never been to a Hindu ceremony before so we made sure to include this on our tour of northern India. Sadly, we were told that we weren't allowed to take pictures inside, though I saw others taking pictures here and there. The evening ceremony we attended was short, about fifteen minutes in total, but was uplifting and energetic which I absolutely loved. You will need to remove your shoes to enter the temple and it's a bit chaotic in the designated area for parking and shoe storage, but we were lucky to be paired with a guide who was able to have our shoes stored in an interior cubby instead of out in the open. Once the ceremony was over the sun had fully set and we got to see the temple lit at night which was equally as beautiful. It was like we were completely removed from the city once we were up near the temple, too. It felt private and secluded in the nicest way possible, like Jaipur was miles away. Even if you can't make it to a daily ceremony, I would recommend stopping by to see the gorgeous architecture and the stained glass scenes from Hindu events and history."
