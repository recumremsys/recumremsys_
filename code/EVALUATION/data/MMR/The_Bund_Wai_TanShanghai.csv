0,Beautiful view and a good place to walk also cycle around,A must place to visit when in Shanghai. Many western bars around and also roof top bars.  Amazing place to walk around at night and to take good pictures.
1,What a view!!!,Great scenic view of the city. Must visit place if you‚Äôre in Shanghai. Best time to visit is in the evening when the sun is setting and the city is lighted up. Great architectural buildings along The Bund worthy of any architectural geeks üñê.
2,Good views. ,A must visit in Shanghai.  Amazing view of the modern skyline of Shanghai.  Great view during the day but even a better view at night with many of building lit up with beautiful lighting.  It is over crowded at the beginning of The Bund but if you walk a bit further away from the crowd it is better and you can take better pictures of the city.  Equally impressive is all the British colonial buildings lit up beautifully at night.
3,Wonderful views,unique view to towers and great feeling of Shanghai. try it morning and night. easy to reach by train or taxi.
4,Good place to visit,"The most touristy place in Shanghai is the Bund. Exceptional location for all the photo enthusiasts as the skyline is clearly visible from this location. A much crowded and lively place, this place gives you the vibe of true spirits of Shangai. Lights, High Rise Building, Glitter and Ecited Faces, the place simply gives you a very urban feeling. Around the place you will find many restaurants and historic buildings. Shopping is all over the place."
5,Spectacular iconic view of Shanghai,It a must go place in China as the view is very amazing and the light is very nice. There are also a lot of nice food and place to shop at the bund and Nanjing road area. Light is open at 6pm there.
6,Awesome night view with colourful lights!,"Bund in Shanghai is one of those places to visit during the life is beautiful to take pictures and stay for a while. After 30 minutes and al the pictures took is time to go because is too crowd with the police‚Äôs speakers saying something in Chinese many  times and you want to go for a closed bar to drink something, but let me know is very expensive ..... up to you"
7,Excellent view. especially at night,This is one of the most must visit point when in Shanghai.  The view is very beautiful (both day and night) - hopefully there would be no low hanging clouds or mist.  I would suggest to visit both sides of the river to see the different views as for me both sides are equally worth the view.
8,A must-see experience,Amazing place to taking a panoramic pictures..Also there are a lot of shopping malls and cafes around the place
9,Nice View,"This place is definitely a must visit when you‚Äôre in Shanghai!! So amazed by the city lights and it was also breathtaking during the daytime! However, if possible do avoid visiting during the weekend as it might get overly crowded."
10,Unique river view,"on the river bank of Huangpu river where you can walk and take amazing photos especially and nights with towers , see ships and people The surrounding area also is full of great buildings never miss it , this tour can be do with other activities in city center like Nanjing Road  & old street start with old street to The Bund (Wai Tan) to Nanjing Road to people square"
11,Shanghai's iconic sight,"The Bund area is wonderful for daytime and nighttime walks. Although, most amazingly colourful and night. Good restaurants and cafes in the area. Very scenic."
12,Enjoyable stroll,Must go place in Shanghai for the postcard view. Very crowded but the local authority has very good crowd control measure to allow only one direction walking path from / to Nanjing East Road metro station.
13,Very Historic,"Is the most European place  in Shanghai, is really beautiful and have a lot of Fun there, is really full of high level brands and shops. Really interesting the street market"
14,"Beautiful walk, even on a gloomy rainy day","Shanghai main attraction is The Bund and view over Huangpu river. Normally area is full of tourists took all similar photos about skyscrapers another side of river.I reccommend visit there at a time of sunrise, less people and nice colour of light make whole place look different.If you visit at time of dark, notice that city switch off skyscrapers light at 10.00 PMIf you are interesting about history i recommend that after took photo of skyscrapers go to walk around that area. Lot of old western style buildings wait you. Many of buildings have small plate on wall which shortly tell history of building."
15,The most amazing view of Shanghai,"There are many many places to enjoy and spend time near the Bund. Possibly, Grand Kempinski In Lujiazui on the Pudong side is one of the best choice. Recently, I spent a lot of time in the Grand Kempinski Lujiazui on the Bund. I like the Bund view from the Executive Lounge on the 28th Floor. Amazing view from here at any time of the day. Its a huge lounge with 180 degrees open Bund view with free flow F&B throughout the day for the guests. I also like the view from the Havana Bar, Gym and Spa on the Top Floor (30th Floor). Kempinski has a lot of beautiful rooms with great Bund view. I also noticed last week, when I was having Brunch with my kids that they have good view from the Italian Restaurant and also from the Chinese Restaurant. But my most favorite Bund view is from the Jacuzzi, also on the 30th floor inside the locker room of the Gym & Spa. Its stunning! Day or Night."
16,If you're not a nature lover,A walk along the Bund is a must do when in Shanghai! The light show is spectacular & unlike anything anywhere!
17,like,"This is the place everyone must visit when in Shanghai. The promenade is filled with tourists - local and foreign. Every one is capturing the views of the opposite shore Liujiazui, Putong and the Huangpu River.The scene with the nightly lights up is beautiful, but too packed with people. In the early morning next day, there are much, much lesser people. People there go for jogging, walking, saw one even flying kite. It is much nicer to walk along the promenade in the early morning then night."
18,Nightmare to visit during May Day holidays,"The Bund is a must visit when in Shanghai. It offers an amazing view of the Shanghai skyline, especially at night."
19,Why?,"Very touristy area, with lots to see. Many excellent restaurants, cafes, bars, and shopping in the area."

But you may need to trips if you want to admire the designs of the buildings along the whole stretch of the road which is more than 1 kilometer.The area is easily reacheable via the subway with the nearest station being East Nanjing Road station. From there it is a short walk towards the beginning of The Bund which is the McBain building(No 1).Take your time to walk along the stretch and soak in the sights."
21,Nice For a Stroll Along the River,"beautiful walking tour with a fantastic view, much better to be done in autumn days, once there are no shaded spots. tip: get lost in the surroundings streets, such as fuzhou road, where there are very nice ink and brushes shops and small but great local restaurants."

25,visit because you have to!,"It‚Äôs beautiful and very scenic. You can see both sides of Shanghai, the rich heritage buildings on one side and the skyscrapers on the other. Best time to visit is post sunset when all the lights are lit and the view is stunning."
26,Have a Bound on the Bund,"This is a beautiful area of the city where you can walk along the park that goes along the river and view all the lights and buildings lit up on both sides of the river.  The whole scenery reminded me of Times Square in New York, but maybe more beautiful with the boats, the river, and the two opposing sides having different lights and views."
27,Amazing for memories photos ,"This is certainly a must see in Shanghai. Nice area, very crowded, plenty to do and see. Enjoy the views of Shanghai skyline with all the 3 ‚Äúkitchen tools‚Äù towers and the pearl. Best views in the afternoon with the sun lighting the scene."

33,A must see place if you visit Shanghai,pleasant walk along the river and the view to the ultra modern building of Pudong is amazing at night
34,Heart of Shanghai!,"There is good reason people recommend visiting the Bund. Lit up at night it is one of the greatest city skylines.

There are plenty of places to eat or grab a snack/drink, and makes for a great night out"

40,***A*M*A*Z*I*N*G***,Amazing place to walk or taking a cruise during the day or night. A mixture of historical and modern buildings with various architectural styles. The reflection of building lights on the river makes it a magical painting throughout the night.
41,"Brilliant, but bad timing",If you are in Shanghai this place you should not miss especially in the night. Beautiful lighting of the sky scrappers and buzzing streets with locals.
42,Amazing Views,"Stop here.. great arciteghture and good place to get those ""postcard"" pictures. Many tourists so be careful for teahouse and massage scams!"
43,The Shanghai Vibe,"Very modern and amazing night view from the Bund,recommend to take the underground tunnel to go over to the Pearl Tower and stay at the Hyatt Vue Sky lounge for sunset view !"
44,Best area of Shanghai?,Great to visit anytime but the night time is amazing since all the buildings and boats are light show.

48,Must visit when in Shanghai,Bund is definitely one of the places worth visiting. There you can experience a real world class city and the tremendous growth of China's economy
49,"Superb view, especially at nightfall","If you want to see Shanghai city view by river, then this is the place. Cruise is available. I went here in Winter. The weather is chilly, a bit of windy. It is great to go in December if you want to avoid crowds. Nice walk and strolling along the way."
50,Beautiful night skyline,This was our first stop after arriving in Shanghai on tour. Large flat area to walk alongside the river which at the time of our visit in early afternoon midweek wasn't at all crowded. Good opportunities for photos of the mixture of buildings along the riverfront.
51,Walk the Bund,"One of a kind landmark with 360¬∞ views of Shanghai from multiple levels/heights, interesting facts/activities throughout, and a gaming/rides/amusement area for kids. There's way more to do on the inside than meets the eye, and well worth the price of the tickets!"
52,Don‚Äôt miss strolling along the Bund at night!,The Bund is beautiful at night with the lights show. MRT is the best way to get there as it's extremely crowded and has alot of traffic. There will be alot of crowd but it doesn't obstruct you enjoying the view. There are authentic street food shops and restaurants along the way.
53,Amazing place,"The views at the Bund are amazing, worth visiting both day and night. The city lit up at night is beautiful and stunning. The lights are on only from 19:00 to 23:00 in summer and from 18:00 to 22:00 in winter. It is clean and the pathway is wide. There are also benches, which you can sit on. Gets very busy at night after 6pm. The Spectacular architecture along with ferry‚Äôs passing by on the river makes for great photos."
54,Building with bright lights,"Clean and very spacious linear park in Shanghai. The view is great, especially at night when all the LED lights are on.. Very recommended since Nanjing Road is within the area."
55,Wonderful River Side,"This is a wonderful and very popular walk along the river with river cruises, restaurants and drinks kiosks along the way. The views across the water are stunning at night.The best views are on the stretch from Waibaidu Bridge in the North to Shiliupu Marina.in the South.Just watch out for people posing as tourists who want to practise their English. There are police posted along the route so despite that you feel quite safe here even at night."
56,Don't miss the night view,"Great lights along the cold breezy walk. Its a must try and visit when in China Shanghai. Try to do it during Spring/ before Falls, and try to be there to witness both sunset and nightfall. Beautiful."
57,Great place to visit,A wonderful atmosphere. Pearl of Shanghai is amazing. Very crowded in the evenings. Hard to find a location to make a photo.
58,Impressive views a must go in shanghai,Beautiful light show on all the buildings surrounding the river. Lovely decorations as you approach the promenade.

60,Fabulous Views and Ambience,It's a pretty walk and view of the skyline. With the river right there the cooling breeze is also nice.
61,Nice place,Lovely views over the river and great atmosphere.  Go in the evening to see the lights. We sent just before dusk so saw views both day time and evening
62,Must visit in Shanghai,The Bund is the classic skyline one associates with Shanghai. Beautiful at night. Well worth the time to enjoy with friends and take a few photos.
63,"Different spot, different angle from the Bund",The night view of the skyline is really amazing. There is a light show every 30 minutes. Crowd was not too bad for China...
64,A night to Remember,"Very wide open space so tiring if walking.  The display of lights at night is spectacular from anywhere on the Bund.  What is amazing is not just the lights themselves but that they are coordinated.  I counted at least 15 skyscrapers mostly banks, shipping companies and offices all presumably owned by separate people but linked so that at times they would perform linked effects.  Well worth seeing.Nothing much else at the Bund."
65,Amazing views,"these sights were beautiful especially at night. fun activity , clean and safe. for families and couples"
66,Great view ,Walking distance from the nearest Metro. Nice view of the city's skyscrapers. Light show from the buildings in the evening.
67,pretty and definitely worth a quick visit,Amazing views of the Shanghai skyline especially the pearl TV tower and Shanghai tower. It was a very hot day and quite uncomfortable without shade so didn't walk down along the Bund but walked down Nanjing rd for ice cream and coconut drinks. There is a great food court just a short walk down Nathan rd.
68,Best after dark when the cities lights are on.,"Shanghai bund located @ city center, near to Nanjing rd, very beautiful @ night with the reflection of the light on water"
69,Amazing,"Great place 2 take a walk along the river, especially @ night when the building light up and provide a bit of a show .There's boats to tour up and down the river and very close to dining and old shanghaiThere's also great shops for clothing . jewelry and food"
70,Wall Streen on the Shanghai river,Shanghai is very modern and progressive.  It really is a sight to see and the best place to view this is at the Bund.
71,Good view,"One of the best views on the Lujiazui skyline. Furthermore, many historical buildings that once housed numerous banks and trading houses. Less know to most tourists is the Wall Street Charging Bull's brother, designed by same artist Arturo Ugo Di Medica. Typically very crowded during day and evening. Around 10 minutes walk from line 2 station east nanjing road. Best time to visit: Just after sundown when all the buildings including Pearl tower and Shanghai tower (2nd highest building in the world) are illuminated. Going there for sunrise also very nice, much less crowded and one can experience locals engaged in activities such as taichi and flying kites."
72,Fantastic light show,Watch the glimmering skyline of the new Shanghai day and night. The boardwalk is amazing allows you to walk along the river.
73,Too crowded ,"Best time to go there is before and after sunset. You may walk along Nanjing road, it's very near The Bund"
74,Must do!  One of the best city scapes!,This is a must do to walk along and see the sights of Shanghai. a perfect view of the city's skyscrapers. A must if in Shanghai
75,Impressive,Walk the Bund & go to a restaurant to enjoy the view. Loved it all. Best place to see the river & all the action around that area.
76,Perfect Night view ,"The Bund is a nice place to see the lights and the skyline of the city. You see some of the famous landmarks of shanghai such as the pearl tower, jinmao tower and the shanghai tower (2nd tallest building in the world). The best time would be right before sundown that way you get both the daylight view as well as the night view when all the lights get turned on."
77,Good place to take pictures. ,This is a must do for Shanghai. The shops and stores are all the same you'd find in any large city so nothing really special there.  There are some very good restaurants in the area.  But it's not about the insides but what is happening outside.The lights at night-so fun so photogenic. This would be so romantic on a perfect summer night.  On a cold November night it's more of a quick walk to warm up with stops for photos before we rushed back to a taxi.
78,A definite adventure for the westerner to explore Shanghai,"reminiscent of Chicago. Beautiful part of the city, on the river. The wall is made of flowers and you get an incredible view across the river. Crowded but friendly, definitely worth stopping by."
79,Sight Seeing,"Really pretty views at night and worth the long walk to see it from the nearest metro station. Do be aware that a large portion of the lights will switch off at 10pm. We were unfortunate to have only arrived at 10.02pm and to our misfortune, everything on the shanghai tower switched off."
80,Spectacular evening city views amid a mass of humanity,Visiting Shanghai without visiting its symbol is IMPOSSIBLE! So it is a must see when you are in Shanghai. You should be there both in day and night and enjoy the spectacular landscape in day light and of course fabulous lighting at nights. But to see all building full of lights you should be there before 10pm.Spending approximately 1 hour to promenade and enjoying the perspectives is completely worthy.
81,Simply Spectacular,"Extraordinary views of the Pudong skyline.  Very busy on a nice Saturday but absolutely the highlight of visiting Shanghai.  The light show at night is definitely worth seeing but don‚Äôt worry about getting there at 6:30PM when the music is coordinated.  Suggest going a bit later when the crowds thin; the lights will still be doing their thing.  During the day, make sure to spend time walking along the street and checking out the classic Western-style buildings from the ‚Äò30‚Äôs."
82,Better on the Bund,Great ambiance and pleasant walk. Worth seeing in natural light and after sunset for comparison. Highly recommended
83,Must place to visit during visit at Shanghai,"This is oneof the most popular places in Shanghai, due to its historic (almost legendary) importance but also the place which is offereing the best view of the city center. Must visit place."
84,Simply stunning,I always enjoy watching towers and here is where you an astonishing view of many towers. I was there an hour before sunset and saw both day and night view. The only negative point was that on the bridge there is no where to sit and take a rest so maybe you have stand at least 3 hours to completely catch everything ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòá
85,View from the Bund,"I visit shanghai in 2014, and the first place I went to is WaiTan. It is very beautiful, now I have been there several times. Each time has a different view and mood."
86,Tour group,If in Shanghai you MUST visit the Bund - extensive riverfront walkway across the river from Pudong which has a sensational skyline. Extensive beautiful colonial era buildings.
87,Amazing Beauty,Cleanliness is most noticeable while walking this beautiful Bund.  Refreshing and best seen at night while the lights are all glistening.
88,the Bund,"The Bund is a 'must-see' when visiting Shanghai but don't expect to be alone.  Shanghai is very safe and it does not feel threatening but just be aware that, like any big city, you'll need to be aware that pickpockets are around (I had someone unzip my backpack but I did not have anything accessible)."
89,Beautiful Bund,"Great to stroll along in the evening. Light and laser show is stunning. Beautiful flower displays and magic electric butterflies.There‚Äôs a charging bull similar to New York.It gets very busy. Western people are few so be prepared for people to stare at you, especially if you have any tattoos!"
90,The Bund in Shanghai,We walked a long the river and saw all the buildings during the day.. The differed t architecture was great to look at.. Quite a lot of people along the river. We went again in the evening and the sky line was beautiful with all the buildings lit up. A lovely evening stroll.
91,Must Visit,"Everybody talks about the Bund while in Shanghai, it is nice for a walk. I haven't taken the river tour thought."
92,A must see,"Old Shanghai one side, modern Shanghai across the river, best at night when it‚Äôs spectacular! Check out Indigo hotel on the river (old side) which has an amazing roof top bar."
93,Historic river bank and excellent view to city center,"Bund is a great walk, especially at night when all the buildings are lit up. It is like nothing you have ever seen. It is a massive promenade along the river."
94,Great views and photo ops,The Bund was my favorite place to visit in Shanghai. I would recommend taking a boat trip for a relaxing and beautiful view of this beautiful city!
95,Must visit spot for iconic night views,Beautiful views of the Skyline by night. We had a great time in the area. Be sure to book a hotel well in advance as Hotels are fully booked most of the time.
96,Very beautiful place to view at shanghai,"This place is amazing, especially at night when the skyline is lit up by neon lights. English is not widely spoken and google is banned so be sure to remember how to get back to your hotel when you venture down to the Bund, unlike me haha"
97,Great View,Spend a couple of minutes to visit this famous attraction The Bund Â§ñÊª©‚ãØ‚ãØolder days called ‰∏äÊµ∑Êª©ÔºÅIt was not so crowded when we get there by 5 pm and I think it is better to go there when it is completely sunset cause you can see the light sparkling. I still find the night scenery in HK Victoria harbour is better.
98,Amazing lights and architecture,"Definitely a must visit location.The view is great, looking the city skyline across the river. Best timing is sunset.At night it gets more beautiful, sparkled by the city lights."
99,A Shanghai Must!,"This is indeed a must visit place in Shanghai.The skyline is beautiful no matter what time of the day you visit. Overlooking from the Bund side, it is beautiful landscape of modern skyscrapers and latest technology billboards. Between the Oriental Pearl tower and the Shanghai Financial Center, you have a wonderful backdrop for a postcard that will be the envy of many.The bund is also a good place for a casual stroll as the walking pavements are very wide and there is so much view to take in on this boulevard that stretches for a couple of kilometers."
100,Meticulous reminder of Shanghai‚Äôs memorable past ,It is great place to visit both during the day and especially at night. They have light shoes daily from 7 to 10 pm - not to be missed.
101,Very nice side,"The place to see the iconic views across the river. Extremely busy at weekends, so if you can visit during the eeek then that‚Äôs highly recommended."
102,Perfect for a day night. ,View of the bund is nice. They have a very nice evening light show where the whole harbor is alight. You can just hang out there to watch. Though it can get crowded.
103,So impressive,"This is an absolutely must see when visiting Shanghai! I would recommend being able to see it both by day and night if you have time. By day you can take in a lot of the neo classical architecture and get one perspective, while at night both sides of the river are lit up with amazing lights and you get a whole other perspective. There are so many tourists both foreign and domestic along this promenade. It was wonderful to stroll along and take in the sights."
104,What an amazing place!,"If you find yourself in Shanghai, take a walk down the Bund. Great sightseeing, close to shopping. If you are wanting to cross the river the Shanghai Ferry is 2 RMB to cross and it offers a great view of the buildings."
105,New changes in the Bund ( Exciting),Wonderful strolling up and down the Bund. At night all the buildings are lighted using different colors and the boats are going up and down the river. Any trip to Shanghai wouldn‚Äôt be complete without at least visiting the Bund.
106,CBD skyline,"Where old Colonial China meets new Modern China. The lights! The view! Cross the street with 100,000 of your new friends on a warm, weekend evening. Stop at an old hotel for a drink. Enjoy the crowds on the river walk. I've been many, many places, and there's nothing like it!"
107,Great view ,Worth the effort. Only a short walk from our hotel - W Shanghai The Bund. Good bus tours located at The Bund.
108,Great views of the city,"sightseeing waterfront, western style building clustersIt is a fantastic promenade along the Huangpu River."
109,Fantastic ,Too much crowded and not even a space for a family picture. But this location gives a nice view to bund
110,Marvellous view,"It is a must place to visit if you are there in Shanghai. I must say, it's the first place to see in Shanghai specially in evening. Don't miss to wait and watch the sudden lighting at 6 p.m. Must visit place"
111,One of the Great Strolls Anywhere,"Very nice especially in the evenings.  The buildings across the river are all lit up.  Good photo opportunities.  Take the ""psychedelic "" tunnel ride under the river.  Very different and cheap.  Along the Bund,  most of the buildings have a very ""European "" feel.  For a second you might think you are walking in Europe somewhere.  Worth a visit."
112,Amazing view of Shanghai skyscrapers,It is a very nice side but best you go in the afternoon or evening when it‚Äôs getting dark then it‚Äôs much more nice!
113,Stunning Bund view from Grand Kempinski Lujiazui,"On this side (Pudong) it is less crowded as on the North side. It is really nice to see the barges, ferry boats and excursion boats on the river. Also it is nice to watch the illuminated buildings.Recommendation cross over the river by ferry boat for 1 RMB."
114,Worth the effirt,An evening walk. Magnificent evolving light show on the shoreline of the river. Lighted boats pass on the river as the towers change colours and dance on the buildings
115,Iconic,Crowded but definitely worth checking this place out esp at night where the buildings light up. Stroll along the bund to catch different views from different angle. Be sure to check this place out when you are in Shanghai!
116,Beautiful walk,wondeful views especially in the evening. i recommend finding a sky bar and enjoy the view while sipping a coctail
117,Beautiful scenery ,This is one of the most incredible views in Asia. Make sure you there after 6:00 PM to see the light show!
118,Amazing,"We had a lovely walk along the Bund taking in the sights and sounds of the place, very busy with tourists. was a pleasant hour or so but nothing special."
119,take a walk,Stunning skyline especially at night. There are so many lights etc on all the high rise buildings. Very colourful. We enjoyed a river cruise in the dark to appreciate the views. This skyline impressed me more than the New York one.
120,Great place for photography ,"The Bund is simply amazing and must-go. The sign is unique to Shanghai and truly breathtaking. The Bund looks quite different during the day and night, personally I prefer the night sight."
121,One time,"Its relaxing walking along the bund without any agenda. Good to travel free and easy so you'll have more time strolling from the ""beginning"" to as far as you like.Accessing to the bund is also easy. You could took a train or the local bus. Use baidu map, it's really great."
122,Beautiful and breathtaking ,"Very interesting, relaxing, just a great area to view the amazing buildings of the Financial Centre and the goings on on the rivet"
123,I just don't get it!!,Great area fantasic building  very high  i enjoyed a bar called cloud 9 on 87 th floor  wow views over the city  just try it  drinks like all in shanghai nice places little expensive
124,Absolutley Amazing,"Spectacular lights at night, went on the boat tour around and got to see the amazing lights in the high rises. It was about 1 hour ride,"
125,Very nice view,Loved walking along the Bund and looking across the river towards the city skyline. The beautiful view of Shanghai is something I will never forget. I did a night cruise with The Huangpu River tours which was a bit tacky but worth it to see the city from the water.
126,Gorgeous views lovely walk,There are no words to describe the awesome view. The crowd is well-controlled options to ride the ferry and to buy souvenirs. It‚Äôs a must see!
127,Stunning vista,The Bund is always nice. We were there in the evening looking towards Pu Dong with the skyscrapers and the lights. There are lots of people taking photos. A good place for walking along the river.
128,Classic Skyline... Great stroll in the evening,"Came here in December 2019, and the view is certainly breaktaking. On the Puxi side is where the historic colonial-era buildings are, and they have been restored to perfection. Across the Huangpu river are the modern skyscrapers with bright lights.  Certainly worth a visit to take in China‚Äôs present-day development and modernity."
129,A must when you are in Shanghai,"I loved the view, this place is usually packed in the evenings but the view is amazing. You get to experience the beauty of the Oriental Pearl tower at night. Take your camera, snap a couple of shots!"
130,Amazing...needs to be visited daytime and evening,"Day and Night, there is a good reason to come to The Bund.Seeing the sights along the river, views of Pudong, people watching, looking at the wonderful old buildings, and lastly, the exciting light shows at night.  There are many, many reasons to come to The Bund.  It is free and it is a world-class experience."
131,Old Meets New,"Spectacular skyline on the Yangtze, clean, safe , hassle free . Great place for an evening stroll after dinner, just get there before 2300 when the lights go out !"
132,Great walk along the waterfront ,A must go visit .. especially at night. See how Shanghai turns into a city of ‚Äúgold‚Äù ... it‚Äôs so nostalgic & mesmerising.
133,A place for a great stroll along the Bund,"to walk along the bund with its old majestic colonial style building is wonderful, especially when you se the contrast of the skyline on the other side of the river. the bund is a must for every visitor going to shanghai. unfortunately most structures of old shanghai have been replaced with new buildings, so the bund is a truly historical place."
134,excellent ,"The tour at night time is a must, the lights on every building are gorgeous and together make an impressive showcase, not far from the sights in the cult sci-fi classic film. Some of the lights are animated so it's a must see!"
135,Great view,"The bund contains tons of restaurants, great views, and water boats. I go out with my parents to eat there a lot, and we all love it."
136,Beautiful night scene of city,The promenade separated by a busy road provides a wonderful view of the Bund buildings and across the Huangpu River to Pudong. After 7pm Pudong puts on a spectacular light show on all its buildings.
137,dont miss,Did a walking tour through the BUND.  It was clean and safe.  Interesting to see the history of the location.  The old city next to the BUND was incredible
138,Pro-Tips for Visiting the Bund,"bund is lovely at night when its all lit up , its only downfall is it is way too busy , but its a must see"
139,Historical Bund A Must Visit In Shanghai ,"No words can describe the view, the lights, the feelings. It is unbelievable and all visitors have to go there"
140,Stunning at night.,"couple of tips , go at night when they light up the buildings, very beautiful there a lot of police , it very safecan be quite crowded so about 9.30pm..is when people are starting to go home, so be careful of timing otherwise you cant get a didi or you have to wait a long time"
141,Beautiful scenery!!! ,You must spend an evening walking the Bund at night if you are in Shanghai. The view of the HuangPu River and all of the surrounding beauty of the Customs Buildings and the modern high rise hotels/offices lit up with vibrant strobe lights is fantastic.
142,Icon of Shanghai,"It's chilling cold weather when we decided to walk around tge bud but it was worth it because of the view. There are alot of tourists so its quite hard to take some photos. But all in all it was a great experience, safe and clean."
143,Great day and night,"Sure, you can walk along the Great Wall when in China, but for my money a stroll along the Bund In Shanghai at night is an unsurpassed experience. You will not be alone - often hundreds and even thousands will be perambulating with you along the elevated walkway. On one side of the river are the stately edifices of a bygone time - the Peace Hotel, Bank of China building, etc. Across the stand the skyscrapers of the New China, boldly flashing neon that reflects off the river. The effect is exhilarating and in some respects sobering - this is China‚Äôs calling card and it says you not only need to respect us, but be in awe."
144,Bound yourself into the magical light world of the bund,"We visited the Bund at night time to enjoy the atmosphere, lights and scenery, a little crowded with all the local and tourist but so worth it.Our tour group, Inter Trips did a fantastic job of co ordinating the tours,hotels, etc."
145,Was expecting a bit more,The lightshow on the skyscrapers is so spectacular that one can spend hours just watching it. It is a spacious area and a great walk by day and by night as well.
146,Shanghai Symbol,"The Bund is among the ""It"" places that should be on your to do list when in Shanghai. After you visit, live like a local and take the ferry across the river to the financial district in Pudong and visit Pearl Tower and Super Brand Mall."
147,Spectacular location in Shanghai ,Lifetime view. Best time to visit late evening so you can enjoy the lights on buildings. I loved every minute. Its a must see in town.
148,Impressive view,"Spectacular views, not too crowded in December, very accessible.I went there as part of a free walking tour"
149,Beautiful by day and night,The beauty of the Shanghai skyline was a wonderful surprise to me. We first saw visited The Bund by day and then were lucky enough to be invited on a cruise so we could see the skyline by night. An absolute must.
150,WOW !!!,excelllent place to walk and see the skyline of shanghai during the day and during the night in which the night is magical with the skyline
151,Great view of Shanghai,The Bund runs along the water front with distinctly with European and American architecture. Make sure you have your walking shoes as it is a long walk but worth it. The river front as many terminals for ferry and cruises.
152,Colonial Shanghai,Every trip to SHanghai should include a visit to the bund. It's fine during the day but best at night where you'll see an incredible free light show and the Shanghai skyline. They turn the lights off around 10 pm so go early evening. There are plenty of restaurants and bars across the street from the river
153,Sight to see,"If you travel through Shanghai, no chance you'll miss the Bund, its history and its view on the Pudong skyline."
154,Must see by day and by night!,"What I really like about this place is how huge it is and how you can feel both sides of shanghai;  the new shanghai and the old French concession, which is very nice! It is a great place to take amazing photos!"
155,The lights of The Bund,"Typical tourist site, full of people taking pictures and moving like sheep. It's the recognition of the power of money above all else."
156,the most emblematic place,We booked a hotel (Les Suites Orient) at the southern edge of the Bund. Great to stroll around day and night. Really loved to go for a run in the morning. Enough restaurants to choose from.
157,Shanghai Bund,"Nice during the day but really needs to be seen during the night. The light show is spectacular. The night time cruises do enhance the experience a little, but maybe not enough to justify the cost. Yes there are plenty of people but still able to get the shots you want and wasn't really impeded in anyway. Our visit was during December so if visiting at night, definitely rug up."
158,Night viewing at The Bund,This was with out a doubt one of our favorite sights to see in Shanghai.  The stroll along the waterway and the sights were impressive.  We enjoyed people watching and the different angles and views you get of the sky line are unique.
159,An iconic area in Shanghai,"This is one of my favorite place, i am going to this place for several time within 3 days, you can see the light from the building, or you can take a cruise to enjoy the river, the weather and the view is very amazing, you will not dissapinted to come to the bund.."
160,A remarkable waterfront but beware of pickpockets,Really highlights Shanghai's beautiful skyline. Go at night for the lights. Make sure you look across the street--the historical buildings-most with a unique story of their own look equally amazing when lit up.
161,Amazing Views,"The Bund is one of the best pedestrian walkways along the Hangpu River. Shops and restaurants alongside, with others across the street. It has great scenery from the harbor to the financial district with spectacular views of the World Financial Tower and TV towers. Can walk and relax. On weekends crowded even in the winter. Go at night to see all the buildings lit up with a special light show for hours after dark."
162,Shanghai bund,"Had a day off from work and spent a few hours here, perfect for people watching and lots of beautiful scenery"
163,Iconic views,Amazing View. Modern skyscrapers on one side and old architecture on the other. Definitely worth a visit.
164,Stunning ,"A must see on any visit to Shanghai. We have been here several times and marvel every time at the crowds and light show. For the full effect visit both at night and during the day, unbelievable."
165,A long walk and cruise to see the Bund,Fantastic views at night and in the day a lot of photoshoots in the morning for weddings etc the views are great and leads to the bund sight seeing tunnel
166,THE BUILDINGS NAD THEIR LIGHTS AT NIGHT ARE QUITE REMARKABLE,This is the elevated leeve that runs for a mile or two along the Huangpu River and gives you a pleasant view of the city. It is easy to hop on and off to go visit buildings you find interesting as you stroll. We had a guide who was able to talk about the history of the buildings which made it a lot more interesting. You can board the ferry boats from the Bund. At night the buildings are lit up and it makes for a pretty walk. there are free bathrooms under the Bund at strategic locations.
167,View and more,"The Bund is a bread 'n butter tourist ""have to"". Walk it, do a day walk and a night walk. Night is spectacular. We love it."
168,"You cannot visit Shanghai and NOT go to the Bund, especially at night!","Went full of expectations but found a murky river, view of fancy sky-scrapers and an odd selection of  older style European office buildings. Lots of photo kiosks but nowhere to find a decent coffee. Lights tunnel straight from Disneyland ends up in a backstreet on the other side of the river! Better to explore behind the old office buildings. There appears to be a wedding registration office with extremely interestingly dressed wedding couples. We even got caught up in a 'Fashion shoot' which was, quite hilariously, making for exciting traffic conditions in the narrow lanes. Forget the hype - just wander!!!"
169,Amazing walk in the dark,"Amazing view, one of the greatest skylines I ever saw. Go there at dusk, and enjoy the lights when it's dark. Not to be missed."
170,Fantastic View,The Bund is always a right choice. Whether in the day or at night it is a lively area with great views of Pusina and with plenty of restaurants to choose from
171,best view in Shanghai,"I was visiting 10 years ago, and today still breathtaking. Bit crowded (of course) but worth always to pay a visit and enjoy the view. Definitely a must when visiting"
172,Extremely crowded on weekends ,The place to go in Shanghai. We had a layover in Shanghai and we had just few hours.The place is very nice overlooking the river.You can enjoy a nice walk and visit the shops in the area. It is kind of far from the airport.
173,Wonderful Promenade,Amazing... we viewed from Shanghai towers during day and the Peninsula roof terrace bar at night for cocktails and a spectacular light show.
174,Shanghai Must Visit ,I have been to Hong Kong light show so I thought this would be ordinary- but I was wrong.Old world meets New Technology
175,Impressive skyline,Shanghai is never more beautiful than when it lights up at night. Talk a walk down this stunning promenade to see both the glowing ‚Äúold world‚Äù and the flashy and modern ‚Äúnew world‚Äù across the river.
176,Perfect spot,"If you stand on this promenade, you will be offered views of Shanghai architecture from the 1860's and on until the 1930's (the Shanghai International Settlement) on one side, while, if you turn around, right across the Huangpu River, in the Pudong District, you will be mesmerized by the stunning riverside architecture of sky-kissing diversely-designed modern buildings rising above the riverfront wharves and complementing cosmopolitan Shanghai. There is so much history and culture to be appreciated here that it made me fall in love with this old-meets-new city. Try coming on the earlier side of the day to avoid the mosh pit of people looking to enjoy the sights and, if you are REALLY lucky, a sunny, clear day will make you, too, fall in love."
177,Amazing,By day you can walk along the riverside boardwalk and maybe watch a local couple taking their wedding photographs or perhaps a model with her camera entourage. But I believe this is best visited at night as it is truly a spectacular sight. It is not expensive to book a River Cruise up and down The Bund to see the CBD buildings of New Shanghai magically lit up. It is an absolute highlight when visiting Shanghai.
178,Must see and do,I was not expecting too much from Shanghai being a modern fast growing city but I found it exciting. I had a very nice walk at the Bund. The view is wonderful especially at sunset and evening. Please count on being there with thousands of other people. You can also indulge in a rooftop bar for a different view. For sure the view from the rooftop will pay off the expensive cocktail.
179,Wonderful dining & scenic views by The Bund,The view is free and an absolute must to see.Suggest to go in the evening when the sun has already set to fully enjoy the lights.
180,Beautiful red colours,You really can‚Äôt beat the views and the space for a leisurely walk. Boat tours leave from here for gorgeous day and night cruises. Nighttime suggested!
181,Beautiful,The Bund is obviously a must while in Shanghai but they aren‚Äôt kidding when they say it can get incredibly foggy. As soon as you have a sun break go! Don‚Äôt wait like I did or this will be your Bund pic
182,A night time epic,"The Bund is a main meeting place for locals and tourists in Shanghai - it skirts along the Huangpu River.  It is a must see-do site.  The river is wide and long.  The river traffic includes ferries, launches, and pleasure craft.  It is basically a wide ""cement""  walkway.  There are Police everywhere.  There are people everywhere.  Most tourist buses drop you off at the Northern end (near the Huangpu Park).  The Bund walkway is raised above the ground level and follows the riverside but below The Bund there is a long strip of restaurants, art works/statues and lawns.  The view across the river to the architecturally dominant Oriental Pearl TV Tower and nearby Skyscrapers makes for many opportunities to take photos of the skyline.  But better still is to take the ""under-river"" Waitan Sightseeing Tunnel which connects from The Bund to the far shore - then it is a 200m walk to the Tower and the nearby magnificent circular walkway/bridge/roundabout - walkers above and cars below.  The East shore is another world but you need time to explore it."
183,Fascinating place,"Yes it's very busy and you do get a few people trying to sell you watches and if you're white you'll likely get someone asking for a photo with you. But that's all part of the expirence. The Bund will 100% provide you with Instagram worthy photos. Both sides of the river have an amazing view and are totally different. The walk along the boardwalk is nice even in mild temperatures. Highly recommend going there after dusk when the lights come on. Take a light stroll, take some photos and take in the sights and sounds. Oh and if you do get some attractive young women coming to chat then assume they're interested in your money not your charming good looks, be vigilant and smart."
184,Spectacular skyline,"Superb views from The Bund.. On one end, you'll find the old shanghai and the other end has the new modern view with the pearl tower. The calm river along with a nice boardwalk with so many tourists. Must see...!!"
185,best skyline ever!,"The views, especially at night are wonderful.  The park and walking areas are excellent.  There is limited retail."
186,Fantastic view,"Indeed, this stretch of waterside offers comfortable walking with abundant scenery but limited food and shopping."
187,China trip ,"I was looking for an option around the bund after many visits you keep loving it but the idea of having another perspective and visiting other places for dinner this showed up as good alternative, we loved the walk around there are several options to eat around this area, they don't have the spectacular terraces like main bund but coming out is a nice view and enjoyable walking path along the river"
188,GREAT VIEW!!!,Great way to see the skyline of the financial district day or night. Ferries are available to take you across the river for sight seeing and access to viewing towers. Too much fog in January to go up the towers though.
189,The Bund offers a very spectacular view of Shanghai especially if seen at night,The view of the bund is just splendid. Across the river you get a view of the skyscrapers and on the bund side you get a view of nice European style buildings all light up. Western style buildings are pretty rare in China so it's an interesting sight to see
190,Went at night,"The bund is extremely crowded on weekends. Nice to visit once but I will not go again. Evening is nicer than daytime with the lightings but really crowded. What stood out was how contrasting the buildings are on each side of the river, old vs modern."
191,Nice place to see in the evening,"A day visit is great, but after dark, the buildings are lit up with various colors, scenes, etc., it's hard to believe that so much lighting can be so enjoyable.  Numerous cruises are offered, but a leisurely walk reveals more than enough lights than you can enjoy.  Very relaxing."
192,The city becomes a light show!,"Before arriving, print out a description of the historical buildings.  There are plaques on the buildings but the best view is from the Bund, across the street, or from the promenade on the Pudong (east) side of the river or from a river cruise."
193,Scenery Galore,Uber cold!! As it was a rainy day..but worth the trip there.. beautiful view but slightly cloudy.. nevertheless still breathtaking view.. it was a weekday so the crowd was bearable..
194,Best place to visit whilst in Shanghai ,One of the place to visit of course ... beenMy second time there and the scenery still amaze me ... Quite better at time like the rest of the city
195,Amazing,"the bund is the general area along the huang pu river with all the colonial style buildings from the early 1900's.  the board walk along the river has a great view of lu jia zui, the business center of shanghai with some of the tallest buildings in the world.  from there, you can literally see the oldest and newest parts of shanghai."
196,What a view!,It ia a great place to see the river and the buildings. Not really much else to do other than using it as a place to view and take pictures. Very busy on New Year‚Äôs Eve.
197,Go in the afternoon to appreciate Shanghai skyline in the sun,"We took a lovely stroll along the Bund and were lucky enough to have a local explaining to us that where the iconic telecommunications tower and other sky scraping buildings stand, a few years ago was farmland where her grandparents lived.The buildings on both sides of the very busy commercial river are very interesting and a pleasure to see.There are plenty of photo opportunities, both professional and for the happy snapper,"
198,"A stunning place to take a walk, especially by night, in Shanghai.",The walk along the river is stunning both day and night!What we liked so much was that everyone was out enjoying the site on foot.Lots of families and children enjoying the fabulous lighting of all the buildings!We found Shanghai a very safe place to walk around at anytime of day!
199,Beautiful,Just one of those panoramic scenes you‚Äôll recognize. The architecture in Shanghai is very impressive and the size of the city is overwhelming.
200,Instagrammable moments,The Bund provides a spectacular view of the Financial District all day but the must see is at night. The river is a highway so constant ships including many dinner cruises. The Financial sector is lit up with color changes every second as well as full building TV displays.  Very busy but safe. The golden building's behind you are as impressive.
201,Amazing Cruise on the river.,The sight and view of the Bund with Pearl Tower and all the huge Commercial Building in the background was fantastic. It is very crowded most of the time.But it is nice to stroll along the Bund enjoying the view.
202,Not to miss,"The Bund waterfront is on the banks of river Huangpu.  Its like Marine Drive of Mumbai, which is facing the sea. You can have a beautiful view of the river with skyscrapers across the river. Its worth taking a walk on the Bund. One can take a cruise also.  Carry an umbrella during rains."
203,Spectacular,You simply cannot go to Shanghai and not go to The Bund. This has the nicest cityscape of the whole of Shanghai (not counting views from one of the towers). A lot of towers have light shows in the evening and it is close (relatively walking distance) to Yu Garden.Beware of tourists traps as a lot of merchants will try to sell you overpriced souvenirs but it is a long nice walk along the water and a good starting point to walk around.
204,Old business area,"We walked from end to end and it took over an hour.  The view is spectacular and the area is very safe with security personel all over the place, it is also great for running or other activity"
205,"Go on, you know you want to!","We enjoyed walking around this area and came here at night to eat dinner. While these buildings are old, right across the River are hundreds of modern buildings that are lit up at night- quite a sight!"
206,Picturesque,"Standing at the rivers edge, looking across at the Pearl Tower, and World Finance centre is a good way to spend a bit of time. Watching the boats and barges going up and downstream, moving th goods tat are the life blood of China.There is a lot to see, and is also a nice walk. Lots of little places to stop for a drink and a snack, and a lot of places to have a special photo taken.It can get busy, but just go with the flow."
207,Beautiful Bund,"As a solo traveler, I try to get in as much local sights as possible. This is a must see especially at night. The lights are amazing and shouldn't be missed. I even got a chance to take a ferry to get a larger view."
208, Bund during night,"The Huangpo river skyline of downtown Shanghai is definitely worth seeing - there is just nothing like this in the USA, and it's one of most spectacular cityscapes at night in all of China (and there are a lot of impressive night-time cityscapes!).  However, also very unlike the USA, the sheer mass op people who come out on a mid-week evening to see this sight are difficult to comprehend - it's truly a mass of humanity, so vast as to feel a bit dangerous (in the fear-of-being-trampled vein), and it is for sure difficult to navigate, even for the Chinese.  We hung out for a bit, got some great pictures, but then we just had to escape the surging masses!"
209,Amazing View,"make sure you visit The Bund at night, the lights are fantastic.  Plenty of people there but worth the trouble.  Disappointed that I could not find many restaurants aorund it though"
210,Beauty by night,"To see this you'll need to walk down along Nanjing road before you reach the Huangpu river and see these huge skyscrapers of all different designs and sizes lit up in the night like a fireworks show. You can spot buildings like the Oriental pearl tower, Jing Mao tower and Shanghai tower (the tallest building in china). It's best seeing it at night as you see the flashing lights, and it's not just lights, they move and change too, like in Piccadilly circus. The view also looks good during the day with the bright sunshine giving you a full view of the buildings, even when the city is covered in smog it's still interesting to see the tops of the skyscrapers covered from view in the fog. You'll also see boats sailing by and you can even catch a ferry across the river; you can take the metro under the river over to the skyscrapers but its not as scenic. On this side of the river you can see old buildings with western designs like British or American and there are several shops and restaurants to visit, plus you'll often see people painting, taking photos or even taking wedding photos. On the other side of the river you can visit all of these towers and walk between them on walkways built above the road to avoid the traffic. You'll find a Disney shop, an aquarium, an underground museum of freaky stuff like the world's tallest man and small train that leads under the river for a more scenic trip. Whichever side of the river you're on, there's a lot to see and do."
211,Bladerunner!,"The waterfront view is spectacular and better than any I have seen before. Both sides of the river are lit up, with some older buildings on one side and neon lit skyscrapers on the other. On the river itself lots of boats doing trips are also lit up making it truly spectacular to walk along at night."
212,Night time in Shanghai ,"We walked the Bund in the daytime from Renmin Rd (near Yu Gardens) to the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel during the day and cruised it in the evening to see the lights on both sides of the Huangpu River. It was a long walk, but with so much to see. The flower displays on the walls of the river walk are beautiful as is the varied architecture. Plus you might get lucky and see a number of brides and grooms taking pictures in front of the flower displays or the picturesque buildings. The Sightseeing Tunnel is a fun easy way to travel between the Bund and Pudong. And finally you just have to do a night cruise on the Huangpu to really see the light show in the evening."
213,Great for night and day time walking with splendid view,Pure magic. A place that looks like it's from a fantasy or a story. A memorable experience for all who come to Shanghai.
214,Beautiful Scenery and fresh air,We visited both in the day and night and I feel you should do both as both are great photo opportunities.  You don't need to allow a great deal of time as once you have the photos it is more of a financial district.  The is also a large bull stature which is similar to the one on the New York financial district which you can also get your photo taken with.
215,Popular place to take a stroll in Shanghai,Excellent. A walk through the Jewish history of Shanghai and an explanation of what you see and what it once was.
216,Very nice visit,We went during the day for a stroll on the boulevard. Nice surroundings. Beautiful buildings. Next day had a cruise at night. There was a lightshow on the buildings. So BEAUTIFUL. It was breath taking.Surely worth doing!!! Made lots of photos and filmed as well.
217,Night time stroll,A night in Shanghai without the Bund is not possible. No time last time so now finally had the chance to see it. Relax atmosphere.
218,Amazing!,"You cannot really tell someone about the impact this part of Shanghai has at night.  You must experience it.  The colors, constant movement, creativity and overall experience is one to remember."
219,Fascinating,The walk along the Bund was leisurely and cool (given that it is Autumn season when I visited). Quite crowded at night as alot of tourists are there to take photos of the light shows which started at 6pm. There is a show every 30mins. We went there for 2 nights and the 1st night it was rather foggy but we managed to get clear sky on the 2nd night for good photos.
220,Incredible,"The Shanghai authorities have ensured the Bund‚Äôs early 20th Century buildings have been beautifully restored, and also it‚Äôs worth admiring the lobbies that are open to the public as well as the exteriors. Traffic has been put into a tunnel, and there‚Äôs a long promenade to enjoy the views over to super-modern Pudong. For an aerial view, on a clear day go to the bar at the Park Hyatt in Pudong, where a draft beer is cheaper than the observation deck one floor higher."
221,Very spectacular,It's all been said before but this is something you just can't avoid in Shanghai. Walking along the Bund (particularly after dark) affords spectacular views not only of Pudong but also the more historic buildings along the Bund itself. After dark there are also spectacular light shows which cover a full 360 degree view across both sides of the river. It gets busy but thats not going to put you off is it?!
222,Beautiful Skyline at Night,"The lights and the atmosphere are just amazing.  Actually puts HK and Sydney's Vivid way back on the list.You do need good walking shoes, as getting right along is well worth the effort."
223,Lights and decorations,"If you visit Shanghai, don't miss out on the sights and sounds of the Bund. Also great for fantastic views, especially at night when taking the ferry."
224,Spectacular day & night,"huge sky scrapers, interesting during the day but look stunning at night when they are lit up, do the boat cruise"
225,"Excellent view of the lights, beautiful skyline, worth seeing!","Went on a boat along the river in the evening, it‚Äôs amazing , the buildings just come to life, a definite must do. Nice walk also during the day, but not many eateries unless you cross over and go into the town."
226,A pretty walk,Hard to write anything original about The Bund other than you absolutely must promenade along it whilst in Shanghai.
227,A must visit place.. specially at night,A totally wonderful stroll every night in and around the Bund and the promenade looking out on the Pudong and the fabulous light show.
228,walking around with sights,We ended a day of touring by walking along the Bund.  It was beautiful but even more fantastic at night.  Find a hotel that has a high floor bar or restaurant to see the amazing light show on both sides of the river.
229,Heart of Shanghai,"We only had a brief visit at the bund as our tour only allowed us an hour while the other tour people paid for a tour on the river by boat.It was lovely, the lights on the buildings, so colourful and changing, different signage and ads, it was truly lovely."
230,Good at night,"Keep in mind that Shanghai is Extremely dynamic City. This review is relevant in 2019.Don't expect too much...Pros: Great Photos at Evening Time; Interesting mix of European Architecture and Skyscrapers at another side of river, Great views in EVENING TIME..basically that's itCons: It can be Crowdy - often; Daytime is not gonna be that colorful as you expect  (but still you can use filters if you want to share 'colorful' photos); No any vibes;In general it is a place to take few photos(famous spot for local wedding photography)  and to make part of your jogging route. EVENING: you can get really nice Shots. NIGHTLIFE is pretty Intense in that area. There are few famous spots there. People who love to have Glamorous Party time can find variety of places (not pub, sport bar area).There are tons of places to visit in Shanghai where you could get Amazing Experience compared to Bund. PS:I've been there thousands of times coz of job and may be that's why I don't see some wonderful things at Bund other people see in their reviews."
231,Light Extravaganza,"If the weather forecast says, no rain next morning - be there for a very early sunrise - AMAZING! Totally worth it to get up that early!Wait until the sun comes out and appears behind the towers - it is magic! Watch the people doing sports and let their kites fly.Or be there in the evening, around 7pm the lights are switched on, nice show!Cross the Garden Bridge (take photos of the towers which are reflecting in the water), turn left on the BeiSuZhou Road and go to Zhapu Bridge, take photos from there as well!But - it may be VERY crowdy on national holidays..."
232,the place to be!!,We walked some on the Bund.  We were waiting for more buildings to light up after 5.  We were told that the most interesting building lights up at 6:30.  There are free toilets in several places.  There is a visitor center with people that know English.
233,amazing view from the Bund,We visited the bind during the daytime and found it really pretty and the contrast between East and west was totally impressive. However we decided to go back in the evening and watching the skyline light up building by building was like watching fireworks in slow motion. Amazing. If you only have time to visit once do it at dusk. Breathtaking
234,"So very, very beautiful",If you are going to Shanghai then an evening cruise on the Bund is not to be missed. After dark the buildings along the waterfront given an amazing light show.
235,Great ,"We took the metro to Nanjing East station and walked five minutes to get to the Bund. Well maintained with a nice view of the skyline. There is no shade and it got very hot quickly, even though the temperature was only 78 F. We spent about an hour at this place."
236,Great Evening Activity ,"This area has been considered the center of Shanghai since colonial times. On one side of the river is the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings in Asia, the Customs House, the North China Daily News  and other financial institutions. Across the river is Pudong's modern skyline, including the Oriental  Pearl TV Tower and Jinmao Tower and a number of other skyscrapers. It is a very popular place to walk either day or night."
237,Mesmerising....,"The  Bund is a waterfront area in main area of Shanghai, the largest city in China with somewhere between 12 to 20 million occupants. The Bund is on the Huangpu River. The key features, especially beautiful at night when it is magnificently lit up, are the tall modern skyscrapers. We have some views of a back channel that we toured on a small boat holding about 20  people. This shows the contrast with the rich and poor parts of Shanghai. This area was not too far away from the modern skyscrapers.."
238,Must see,"this place is good, we had to go twice, because the air was cold, the weather was foggy, so the results of the photos and videos were not good so we had to go back again, we were here late until night, free entry, safe because there were many security officers, not to be missed if you go to Shanghai"
239,Neat but very smoggy/foggy ,Take a stroll along the spotlessly clean Bund at night and marvel at all the buildings across the river and they way they are lit up.  It really is quite something to see
240,The place to be especially if it is the first visit to Shanghai,"It is amazing to see the lights at night as they change and shine off of the buildings.  If you can get a hotel along the river with a river view and fairly high up it is worth it.  It wasn't too busy along the walkway when we were there in the beginning of November 2019, even though an international convention was in town."
241,Short stay,"My last night in Shanghai was spent watching the spectacular night view of The Bund, and I never regretted having to jostle my way into the first line just so as to capture the view without people obstacles. The colourful night lights were one of the highlights of Shanghai, and is also a reflection of how economically vibrant Shanghai is. The numerous high-end posh hotels around this region complement the scenery, enhancing the attractiveness of this place too. I was standing behind the metal fence just next to the river, and it was wonderful to witness the various boats floating by with bright splashy colour! From The Bund, one can see the high-rise Oriental Pearl Tower gleaming in every hue. The Bund could be reached via East Nanjing Road train station, followed by a 10-minute straight walk. Be prepared to come here soon to avoid the need for hustling."
242,The obvious number 1 attraction in modern Shanghai,"Still the best shangahi could offer, this amazing place will be in  the ever lasting memory of the visitor. At times bit crowded but worth the visit. Late evening is ideal and if you are lucky there could be a light show."
243,Great lights along the cold breezy walk.,"Yes, the buildings are amazing, but I was expecting there would be a bit more too it. There are some old-style buildings across the street, and some stands selling sodas, but that‚Äôs about all I saw.To me, it wasn‚Äôt a place to spend more than 10-15 minutes."
244,Beautiful architecture ,The best man-made view I've seen anywhere in the world.Superb light show between 8-10pm every night.
245,Must see,A place with a very nice view ...especially at night...crowded with tourist...u can ride a hop on n off bus to explore it
246,number one attraction in shanghai,"The view from the Bund is quite impressive, especially at night. There are some additional light installments, decorating the area.Don't got on the weekend, though! It's just too full to enjoy then. No matter what time of the day."
247,Beautiful,"If I could have more time in Shanghai I would spend it only here, by making amazing pictures, believe me or not but I have at least 1000 pictures of amazing city view :)"
248,Modern and impressive,"All visitors to Shanghai should take a stroll along the waterfront area known as the Bund.On one side of the Huangpu river there are European style buildings.  Look across the river at the massive modern skyscrapers of all shapes and sizes.At the North end of the Bund is the ‚ÄúMonument to the People‚Äôs Heroes‚Äù ‚Äì a tall concrete tower, built in 1993 as a monument for those who died during the revolutionary struggles.Walk down the wide spiral walkway to get a closer look at the inscriptions on the walls.No need to make a special effort, but if you‚Äôre in the area, it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit."
249,Amazing at Night,"overrated, overcrowded, only went because it was a tourist thing to do. Go at night so the lights on the buildings make it worth while, and don't bother walking down the shopping streets - too busy and too expensive. Instead walk along the boardwalk and enjoy the lights."
250,Best view! ,"Don't go during weekends or holidays. Instead try weekday nights...bar rouge is the perfect place to go if you want to have an amazing view of the whole bund area, and have that tourist photo taken haha."
251,Don't Expect too much..,"We visited The Bund on a trip in August 2019.  Our tour group were taken here to stroll along The Bund and see the impressive buildings and some historic landmarks.  It was an enjoyable stroll, and appeared to be a popular place to visit.  The Bund is quite an extensive area, so do allow time to walk the distance to appreciate all there is to see."
252,Breath taking scenerys at Bund,"Most tourists who visit Shanghai will likely consider visiting Waitan (or ""The Bund""), as it is close to the 'Old City' and provides some of the most spectacular views of the Lujiazui District and the Huangpu River. Some will choose to see it by way of a river cruise. Some may just stop for a quick photo and move along to the next site.I was there on a chilly February day, though, the day after Lunar New Year, with no particular agenda and no reason to leave after taking my obligatory cityscape shots. It was an unusual time for a Westerner to be in Shanghai: the city was bustling with visitors, though few of them resembled me, a bearded American standing over six feet tall. Due to the holiday and the tradition of traveling to be with family, the majority of the visitors in town were from rural inland areas, likely visiting their stubborn children who have abandoned traditional country life for the sights and sounds of the big city. This same story plays out all over the world, but due to the relative isolation of inland China from coastal cities like Shanghai and the rest of the world, many of these visitors had never seen someone like me in person before. My presence there was a shock and, often, a delight.Children are the least shy. Many are learning English at school, so they will enthusiastically greet you with ""Hello!"" and ""Good Morning!"" and will often burst into joyous laughter when you respond. I noticed a few younger adults sneaking pictures of me. Eventually, one bold individual approached and asked if he could take one. I insisted on posing for the photo with him. Though we were limited in what we could say to one another, we connected by virtue of the fact that we were both curious to meet one another and tell our friends back home a story about it. After he left, his friend approached me to take a picture. Eventually, I had a line of people waiting to take pictures with me. One young man introduced me to his parents and had us pose for a photo together, no doubt so they could show their friends at home the strange foreign man they met in the big city. It's maybe a little naive to say so, but this sort of human connection is what makes travel worthwhile to me, so I stuck around until I had taken a picture with everyone who wanted one. It makes you feel a bit like a cultural ambassador and was easily one of the highlights of my trip to Shanghai.If you're looking to take beautiful photos of a beautiful city, The Bund will absolutely give you that opportunity. If, like me, you're looking to meet people and have unique travel experiences, then you can't miss spending some time here. It's a good spot for photos, but it's a great spot to connect with other people."
253,Visiting the Bund is a MUST,China wants to show to the world that now it's great power.You can see the enlightments at night.But be carefful it doesn't work every day.
254,Lovely place to take a walk,"We were blown away by how beautiful and modern the cities in China are, and the Bund and Shanghai are their crown jewels. Be sure to take the nighttime boat ride on the Huangpu river. The upgrade to the top level is worth it."
255,Most famous place and view in Shanghai,"The Bund is very cool. Not only do you have a long series of well preserved, century-old buildings in the former Shanghai International Settlement but you also have this wonderful public space between those buildings and the river. Today there is a raised walkway and viewing platform overlooking the modern buildings of Pudong across the river. At night the Oriental Pearl Tower and the other skyscrapers are all lit up and you have a great place to view that from the Bund. Many Chinese wedding pictures are taken here because of the unprecedented view. We walked up and down the bund a couple of times, first to inspect the architecture of the buildings on that side of the river and then to admire the entirely different scene across the river."
256,Great View of the City,"There is always something happening here.  Whether it is brides and grooms having wedding photos taken, to the fantastic light show come night time.  The Bund bustles with people and is great for people watching"
257,"Great view, a must visit","It's an area for tourists. There's no way to get around this. With that said, visiting at night (probably 1 hour after sunset at the earliest) gives some very spectacular views of Pudong, and of the Bund itself (which runs a light show on top of the buildings). Basically, if visiting Shanghai, I think this has to be the most iconic spot to go to, and definitely shouldn't be missed."
258,What a beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è place,"The Bund is the old financial district for the city, the first tall buildings, statues and history. Across the river, is Pudong, the new city. The history of the old city is amazing. The night light show is unbelievable! Don‚Äôt miss it."
259,"Beautiful, must see I‚Äôm Shanghai","Even if you are not romantic, you become but BEWARE there are cheaters approaching you, mainly ladies with a friendly manner that are just profesionals trying to steal you"
260,"Light show at night beats Las Vegas, great views during day","Great for strolling, people-watching and at dusk, watching the lights on the sky-scrapers across the river."
261,And I thought the Rhine was busy..,Walked the Bund city side and ended at the Hyatt top floor bar to finish off the night with some drinks and to enjoy the view. The lights and buildings like Pearl Tower and Bottle Opener are just great to watch from across the river and we were marveling at the old harbor buildings like Customs House as well. Walked here in the evening from 8-10 p.m. and it's a great place to take amazing photos too.
262,Best place to run and also watch the night lights,"The place for the Instagram photo in Shanghai.I spent around an hour here, waiting for darkness and the lights to come on. The Oriental Pearl lit up last, at 6pm.Word of warning: in the hour that I spent in this area, I was approached by at least 12 single (and very pretty) Chinese girls, each of whom were 'on holiday for the weekend', and wanted to improve their English by having a conversation with me over a drink. Seems a bit unlikely to be a coincidence, I'm not sure what was going on, but just politely declined each approach, and said that I was leaving soon to get to the airport."
263,What a view! ,"The Bund is phenomenal.  I can‚Äôt describe how beautiful the Shanghai skyline is form The Bund.  Also some amazing colonial bars to get a drink.  I recommend The Waldorf for a drink, they were wonderful."
264,Best at Night,"I've been to the Bund several times before but the area is ever-changing and always interesting.  Whether you want high or low scale shopping or dining, this area feels lively, engaging, and relevant.Just a few blocks away are less touristy areas where the food is cheap and always available.  A few bao-tze at $.75 for three is so satisfying and straight from the steamers.  Just point and pay.  Ask for ""rou"" if you wish meat-filled.Thankfully the old-style buildings of former banks and financial institutions still guard the main street and are reminders of Shanghai's commercial history."
265,Stunning skyline at night,"Was there on a day that‚Äôs not too crowded, and the light up was magical when it happens. Walk further from the main entry point for better photo opportunities."
266,"A timeless appeal, breathtakingly beautiful at night","We arrived before sunset, so we had the luck to see a wonderful play of lights. Take a tea or coffee and watch the ships passing."
267,Most visit,Lots of fun wandering around and looking at crowds and left-over history.   There were photo shoots of clothing models in the back streets and lots of Chinese tourist enjoying their own country.
268,The buildings are spectacular ,"We visited The Bund in Shanghai last month during our trip to China. The Bund, the historical founding site for the city located right along the river, was very interesting. It's a site of major comparisons with the old historical buildings on one bank, all classical and neo-classical architecture; and all very modern tall skyscrapers on the far bank.There are numerous restaurants and attractions along the ""old"" side of the Bund and well worth a visit."
269,Like Hong Kong by better!,"The Bund or Wai Tan in Shanghai shows the picturesque Shanghai CBD skyline across the river, with a more spectacular view seen at night. My second time here, and the number of buildings and skyscrapers have since increased since 5 years ago."
270,Beautiful memories ,"An area that is filled with history, AND people! It is as if COVID pandemic does not exist in Shanghai and not on the Bund. Very large crowds, but police is doing a pretty good job making people traffic flow and avoid congestion. The embankment of the Huangpu River is well done - lots of chances to take pictures of iconic skyscrapers of Pudong and the historical buildings along the Zhongshan Road. If you just want to come take in the view - no need to spend a lot of time. However, if you are interested in the history of the buildings (and the part of history of Shanghai that they represent) then spending more time walking along Zhongshan Road would be very interesting."
271,Love this place,Were due to take this trip on the Monday evening but due to bad weather it was cancelled but had no problems transferring to the following evening. the trip takes approx 50 mins and wow what an experience. There are 2 decks on the boat< Wrap up warm and stand outside  for the best experience. And dont forget your elbows as people just keep pushing to get to the favoured positions. There is no on board commentary but thats not needed with the views and atmosphere surrounding you. Dont miss you will not be disappointed.
272,Fabulous views,"We loved it. A daytime stroll popping into the former HSBC bank building, a river cruise, an evening walk starting at the Waibaidu Bridge, and going up the Shanghai Tower for dusk. It is an ever changing waterfront and thoroughly enjoyable. A great blend of contemporary and historic."
273,The best man-made view I've seen anywhere in the world,"The day I went was not very crowded, but a little chilly and windy. Go are night to see the lights. The day I went the lights started around 7:30PM, but ask on of the officers on the walk way they can give you the time they will start on the day you go."
274,"clean, interesting history","The light show was great. In the daytime, the Bund reminded me of France, as far as some of the building‚Äôs looked"
275,One of the main reasons to come to Shanghai,Visit during the day and night - completely different experiences. Note that the lights show ends at 10 pm sharp.
276,One of the most famous scenes in the world,Best tip for the Bund. Go at night. Go to the Hyatt on the Bund and up to the Vue bar on the 32nd floor. Cover charge of 110 RMB but you get a drink included. Go to the outside deck and enjoy one of the best city views in the world! You‚Äôre welcome!
277,THE Must-See Attraction of Shanghai,"I was lucky enough to be taken to this amazing spot by a friend of mine who is a local and wanted to show me the best places to visit in Shanghai. We went there using public transport and I was really happy that it was an easy to access destination and also the environment was superb. I was lucky enough to go on a day and time that it wasn‚Äôt crowded. I got to see an amazing skyline that I used to see only in photos, Hahahaha. Best place to visit during sunset so u get two views and also a light show."
278,Stunning views of the waterfront,New winds are blowing to the Bund where the traffic crossings have been upgraded with blinking lights on the road to prevent those mobile phone zombies who only watch the phone while walking of crossing the road wrong time. Also these new security towers with lights and cameras to supervise cars and people crossing the road ( they also show your picture if you cross the road on a red light).For next 4 months the east nanjing road to the Bund will be under construction. This is to increase the sidewalk area to ensure safety.Other than the best time to visit the Bund is during Monday to Friday 8:00 to 18:00 after that there is traffic.The lights are closing for the whole Bund 22:00 for environmental protection.
279,Must do,"Went to the Bund at night during the May Day holidays. Big mistake! The crowd was horrendous. We were literally pushed along by the sea of people as soon as we exited from  East Nanjing metro station towards the bund. The police were out in full force controlling the crowd.  Could hardly get a good view or take photos. Virtually every view was blocked by the crowd. We left within half an hour and it was another big big challenge to squeeze our way back to the metro station.  On hindsight, it would have been easier to go across the river and exit at Lujiazui station near Oriental tower and view the Bund from across the river."
280,"Great Views, Medium Retail","We went on a very foggy day unfortunately, so we saw a less common view across the bund. It was still very beautiful to see the buildings half visible, a little like a ghost city. I'd recommend going on a clear night to see all the lights and city, and then also on a foggy day like we did, to get the other side of the experience!"
281,Stunning,"We dined by the river on the other side of The Bund from the Oriental Pearl Tower. The evening views were spectacularly beautiful, with a wonderful blend of colours, many continuously changing. One of the world's best nightlines."
282,Beautiful ,"A must view at night - during the day you don't get the most out of this experience. You can take our own photos or use the various local kiosks that deliver personalized wooden photos on the spot. Very nice, safely, clean and beautiful. Don't miss."
283,Fantastic,Astonishing to think this was farmland just a few decades ago. This city has life and energy to spare!
284,Must see!!,I travel extensively throughout the world...and there are no views that regardless of how many times I have seen it still leaves me in awe!!!!! Walking along the Band and looking over at Pudong is a must! The light show is beautiful and captivating. The architecture is stunning and there's just so much to see and do on the Bund.
285,The Bund,"We visited The Bund in the morning.  The Bund is a neo-classical waterfront promenade in central Shanghai. The old colonial area buildings were constructed in the 1920s & 1930s, the Bund has dozens of buildings of various architectural styles from the British era. Strolling along is nice, because you will encounter locals and tourists alike. SEE photos."
286,"30 years & now 18,000 high rises",I was in China on business and flew in and out of Shanghai.  My driver was nice enough to take me to the sightseeing pier (thank goodness for translation apps!).  It was great!  We also walked to some nearby shops and enjoyed some food!
287,Visit at night,An evening visit to the Bund is an experience not to be missed. There is both a sympathy and contrast between the lighting on the old European influenced buildings and the multi colour display visible on the high rise buildings on the  Pudong side of the river
288,Great piece to walk and see the sights along river. ,I went with friends and we were surprised to know that we have come to visit in a timely September week.  They were celebrating the moon festival so ALL lights at the bund area were lit.  What an amazing view from the bay area.  Make Shanghai your bucket list...
289,Night Lights,Had a very good couple of days wounding around the Bund.Try a trip down the river on the boat is a great way to see the Bund
290,I guess it is # 1 for a reason.....,"The best time is way after sunset.  Before approaching the Bund, you will be aware of a certain glow in the sky and as you get closer, the traffic gets congested with more pedestrians moving towards the epicenter of a UFO as it were.   Once you reach the Boulevard the hustle and bustle will hit you with the wind-force from the waterfront.  There are policemen everywhere to ease the flow of traffic as well as people.  The atmosphere out there is similar to a heavy metal concert.   The panoramic view of the Pearl Tower and CBD on the other side is spectacular because of it all being well lit up.  Even all the buildings on the Bund are just as well lit up.   It can be a night well spent out there if you take a ride on the ferry and brave the chilly air."
291,The Bund at Night,"Whilst on business I had been able to take my son, so we headed out on an organised trip that took us to the Bund. It‚Äôs a really great location on the river and allows you to see the Financial District with its futuristic towers, but also to get a feel of the more historic Shanghai from the Bund."
292,"Usually quite crowed, great view tho.",Nothing very special in here. Only heaps of high buildings that lightened up brightly at night. Lots of people along the river taking photos of the building. There is no one selling any food / drink at all here. So you need to go somewhere else for food.
293,Scenic,"It took three blocks of police-facilitated steet crossings to get to the Bund, but when we were there we enjoyed the view. It was a bit challenging to get a good photo spot."
294,Local sights,"I had high hopes for the Bund but was disappointed.  Perhaps I set my expectations too high.  You walk on a promenade and view the city's spectacular skyline, but that is about it.  You don't really get that close to the older buildings.  Tips: You will be walking a lot.  There is not much for toilets or food, so plan ahead,  The crowds are massive.  Walk at night to see the entertaining light show.  Summer is probably very hot. We visited in November and were very comfortable.  There is not much for shopping."
295,a little piece of old colonial style in a city of skyscrapers,"I went to The Bund a couple of times because everyone said you should go there.  Once during the day and it was empty.  Then at night and it was packed due to a holiday.  It's a large area to walk around along the river.  I'm not sure where it starts and ends but I'm sure I walked all of it.  I guess it's OK, but I didn't see the real attraction.I did have a scam artist say she wanted to practice her English with me.  I think she just wanted a free dinner or to get me to go to her friend's restaurant.  I declined."
296,Leisure,"The Magnificent ¬´Historical Bund¬†¬ª: In Mandarin Chinese Â§ñÊª©; pinyin: W√†itƒÅn, literally: 'Outer Beach') is a must visit waterfront of central Shanghai. The area centers on a section of Zhongshan Road (East No.1 Zhongshan Road) within the former Shanghai International Settlement, which runs along the western bank of the Huangpu River in the eastern part of Huangpu District. The area along the river faces the modern skyscrapers of Lujiazui in the Pudong District. The Bund usually refers to the buildings and wharves on this section of the road, as well as some adjacent areas. From the 1860s to the 1930s, it was the rich and powerful center of the foreign establishment in Shanghai, operating as a legally protected treaty port.The Bund houses 52 buildings of great and varied architectural styles. predominantly Eclecticist, but with some buildings displaying Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, Baroque Revival, Neo-Classical or Beaux-Arts styles, and a number in Art Deco style. As a matter of fact, Shanghai has one of the richest collections of Art Deco architectures in the world."
297,Wow...just wow!,"always there are lots of peoplebe careful pickpockets. it happens a lot.added to that, if u want to see oriental pearl tower closer. go to the IFC rooftop. not crowded, most people barely know this viewpoint I reckon."
298,The Bund,"I was jet-lagged out of my mind so I took an early walk around 5:00a, stopping by some street vendors to pick up delicious breakfast items. I found myself at The Bund quite by accident and was impressed with its early morning beauty. The bonus is that it was practically empty, except for a few runners and the ever-present police, who all mind their own business. The city is amazingly quiet, more so early in the morning. I can't imagine what this place is like later in the day or in the evening, but having the whole walk to yourself on an early December morning is a real treat.I only walked a few blocks of the Bund and didn't see much else to do - there are a lot of upscale hotels and banks on the street, but not much in the way of restaurants or shopping - so I wouldn't budget too much time for this. But it's definitely worth your time for an early morning visit."
299,Great place,"The Bund in Shanghai stretches one mile (1.6 km) along the bank of the Huangpu River. Traditionally, the Bund begins at Yan'an Road (formerly Edward VII Avenue) in the south and ends at Waibaidu Bridge (formerly Garden Bridge) in the north, which crosses Suzhou Creek.  The Bund centres on a stretch of the Zhongshan Road, named after Sun Yat-sen. To the west of this stretch of the road stands some 52 buildings of various Western classical and modern styles which is the main feature of the Bund dating back nearly a Century, including the landmark Customs House (1927) and the HSBC Bank (1923) Buildings. The closest subway station is East Nanjing Road, about a five-minute walk up Nanjing Road from The Bund.Walking on The Bund is great in the day or at night, but I love it at night with the beautifully illuminated architecture and the fabulous Pudong Skyline with the Pearl Tower and the Financial District buildings.  The lights are turned off at 11pm.  In summary no trip to Shanghai would be complete without a visit to The Bund."
