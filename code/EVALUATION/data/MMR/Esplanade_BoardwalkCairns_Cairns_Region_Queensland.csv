144,Outstanding ,I always enjoy doing this walk. It’s great for exercising and enjoying the view of cairns. It’s great to see that Cairns Council really take care of their city.
145,Refreshing,"The long expanse of beach, soft waves from the sea, long line of trees with a verdant greenery, a clear and safe bicycle lane and sheltered road for joggers. These consist the harmony of nature awaiting the influx of people to its arms. It is a place to take delight and enjoy the unconfined easy going free activity offered by this coiffured space."
146,Great way to get around,"When in Cairns, taking a walk along the boardwalk is a must do. It is a relaxing and fun activity, with beautiful views."
147,It was a walk ,"Cairns boardwalk is a must do attraction when in Cairns. I highly recommend everyone to go there and day and at night time. It’s unique with its  bio diversity of birds and fishes. It also surrounded by local cafes and restaurants, where you can step out and have a lunch break for example."
148,One of the nicest walks by the sea you can wish for,An early morning stride is a great way to start the day in Cairns. The boardwalk is full of interest.
149,Beautiful area for a stroll,"Walking the Esplanade Boardwalk was a wonderful experience.  It was romantic, it was for families, it was for friends.  It really could be everything to everyone.  And it was wonderful to see the number of people using it, and using it with respect (I didn't see litter, I saw people cleaning up after using the public grills in the adjacent park area), I saw families and groups of teens enjoying the swimming area.  I liked the public art and memorials."
150,Wonderful surprise,"Good walking track rspecially if the tide is in, good for all abilities, strollers and bikes. Lots of things to look at with the Lagoon pool at the southern end"
151,Boardwalk,"Nice boardwalk if there would be a nice view of the ocean, due to dredging there is mostly mud though. It is interesting to look closer in to the mud with the thousand of crabs walking around."
152,Cairns esplanade,It is the perfect start to your day in Cairns. Start with an easy walk along the boardwalk. There are places to stop if you want to do specific exercises on the fitness machines  or a hearty breakfast at the cafe.
153,Walk on by,Nice setting to enjoy an morning or afternoon walk.  Walk a little or a lot. Watch the pelicans and crabs as you pass by.

155,Now that was a boardwalk!,"The blue lagoon is the perfect place to chill or cool down at almost anytime and the free bbq areas are just the perfect touch. Cairns is just such a chilled place, perfect to unwind"

159,Check out the Bird Life,Much preferred walking the esplanade than the street walk to Cairns city from our accommodation.  Lovely breeze and an easy walk
160,Strolling along the Boardwalk,This is just kind of a nice place to walk and people watch.  You can also sit and have a cup of coffee or a beer and fries.  The water is pretty and there's some shops along the way.
161,recommended run spot- but only early in the morning,Been a while since I had been there but great investment by city in a walkable area. nice restaurants and bars as well
162,Nice easy walk,"The Esplanade Boardwalk makes for very pleasant strolling in the tropical heat of Cairns. There are many parks and trees along the way, the views and birdlife are great. It’s 2.5 km, and it can be done in different sections, with free car parking at different places. Cairns has done a great job with this."
163,Gentle walk,"Took a night walk. Weather was perfect. Some activities was happening. People having fun, running and exercising. Lights were bright but enough to create a beautiful atmosphere."
164,Esplanade Boardwalk That provides a Grand workout,"A really nice afternoon walk with great vistas. Take a walk along the esplanade around 5-630pm stopping off for a glass or two of wine from one of the many restaurants, bars and hotels on the way."
165,A great place walk or exercise!,"Its a long boardwalk along the beach. I has cafes and tons of green areas, also I saw playgrounds that looked amazing, there are equipment for you to workout and plenty of green grass for you to do a picnic or just sit down. I enjoyed my runs there and watching all the people over the weekend enjoying their time."
166,Night view,"This is a real popular location for people to walk, go jogging, or take their dog for a walk. There are drinking fountains for both you and your dog, along this scenic trail. I would recommend doing this in the day and night time for the spectacular views/  I am amazed the massive differences in the low and high tides.There is plenty of wildlife to see on the waterway and grassy area, plus plenty of seating and picnic tables to relax.  There is a sports areas for exercising for free, beach volleyball, basketball courts, skateboarding areas and is very safe at all times."
167,Nice relaxing walk along the waterfront,"The esplanade boardwalk is continuously busy from early morning to later at night. It provides sights, exercise facilities, access to a kids water park, skate park precinct, shady trees, the lagoon, places to eat & drink, the lagoon and access to local suburbs. Its being continually developed and improved. Great for leisurely walks or serious exercise to to sit and watch the world go by...family and pet friendly too..."
168,Excellent place for a good walk,"This is just the bomb! The pool is fantastic, the weekend entertainment is first rate and the views and free facilities are second to none. As far as setting up a central place to meet, eat and just wander this has been done so well."
169,Relaxing afternoon,To those who put the his area together well done. It's a beautiful spot that you can spend hours in and do lots or little. We really enjoyed this area of Cairns.
170,Lovely place to stroll and people watch,"Great easy leisurely walk,very relaxing & can walk at your own pace with seats,tiolets along the way."
171,Nice walk,"This is a great area for everyone. We visited on a cool Spring afternoon & saw many young kids playing in the water. While others laid on the grass having a snack or enjoying a book. This area is not only beautiful and free, we felt very safe. There are souvenir shops as well as many eateries. We highly recommend!"
172,Relaxing,"A good walk; the city have a piecefull vibe, and this walk have some good views and good places to stop by."
173,Beautiful walkway,"A great stroll at any time of the day, especially at low tide if you want to see lots of migratory birds. There is a small flock of Pelicans numbering around half a dozen or more that spend all their time near the lagoon.Lots of people strolling about all through the day. Lots of insects to sting you in the evening if you forget your repellant. Plenty of bars and restaurants along the road to stop for a drink etc.There are a number of fresh drinking water points along the length of The Esplanade Boardwalk. During the day you will need to have water with you."
174,Boardwalk Cairns,"Love  to walk along the Board walk down to the main hub, where you will find the large open green park that surrounds the free and open pool area.  There are also childrens play areas and a skate park along the walk which extends from North Cairns to the departure point where the ferries leave to the islands."
175,Nice stroll,"We used this boardwalk daily to get from our hostel into the CBD. So well kept and so many things to see; history boards, wildlife and sculptures. It seems really safe day or night as it’s really well lit up. Just keep watch for the croc signs (scared us on our first day there)"
176,Good for a stroll of exercise.,"This is a really nice walk with parks for the kids along the way, also has outdoor gym if you are feeling energetic! The cafe is really good and there is also some useful information about Cairns history"
177,Beautiful Walk,Large expanse of beach side public space with  huge relatively shallow (less than 1m) swimming area. Good for families and relaxing . Very clean and well maintained. Only downside is the lack of any shade from the broiling sun.
178,Relaxing Spot,The boardwalk is well maintained and has some nice photo opportunities but the reality is that the harbour is largely muddy as very little water gets in. Still worth a visit
179,Barry D Rockhampton,"Nice place to spend some time walking along this promenade. It is calm, you relax while walking slowly for about 2km. the environment is nice and proper to relax."
180,Harmony of Nature,"The Esplanade is the best part of Cairns for tourists. Timber deck walkways, Parkland, a lagoon pool and great alfresco cafes."
181,Nice facebook photo spots,"lovely walking area , great views and on the Saturday it had a local craft market set up with some lovely unusual local crafts. worth a walk around"
182,Nice relaxing stroll,Its always nice to have somewhere to walk away from the roads.The walk is quite long as it goes from one end of Cairns to the other. Well worth a walk and jump in the lagoon at the end.
183,Great walk,"The Esplanade is a beautiful boardwalk along Cairns' waterfront and there is always lots going on: Buskers; dog-walkers; waterfowl, this is a safe and scenic way to get stroll the strip!"
184,Nice walk along the harbour,"This is a very pleasant walk, especially in early evening as people are rushing to go to the many different restaurants nearby. In addition, there is swimming pool close to the Esplanade that has been made to look like a beach, with real sand. Whoever thought of this is a genius as many people were enjoying a dip at around 20:00 hours. It was clear to us that people enjoyed the outing and although it was dark there was no threat of violence."
185,Lovely stroll,Nice little walk to enjoy the view. Recommended if you’re a first timer and even if you’re not......
186,Great family atmosphere,"Love my espi and the beautiful lagoon down there!! Great vibe always have markets ,bands ect plenty of food shops just great!!"
187,Great for a stroll. ,Ithink this area is delightful. Even when you are facedwith mudflats its still a lovely area. Excellent childrens play area as well
188,Great walk!,Lovely walk not far from town bring your swimming costume. Nice pool shallow don’t dive in 🤕Shops refreshments available.
189,Beautiful! ,Fantastic for walking and having a drink and bite to eat. Very enjoyable. Walked all day with plenty to see and do.
190,pleasant place for waterside walk,"Beautiful, clean, well facilitated, great for everyone walking, skating, blading and jogging etc... There's BBQs, play grounds, waterparks and a few places to eat and drink. If in Cairns you can't really avoy the board walk so enjoy it."
191,"Stroll, relax and watch the world go by",Not really that much to see or so in it. Some places for kids to run around in water. The ocean was kind of dirty and sad looking.  I’d avoid it.
192,Great relaxing outdoor space on the cities doorstep!,"Very well kept, clean and plenty of seating areas. There are cafes nearby and changing facilities if you need a dip to cool down."
193,"Cruisey walk, good time filler","The walk is nicer northbound than southbound, mostly due to the view. The beach itself isn't that nice comparing to other beaches I have been to. Easy walk. There were a few pelicans. The lagoon/pool is nice, especially for kids."
194,Lovely walk in the sunshine,"A walk along the esplanade is always lovely and always different. When the tide is out you can spot crabs and mudskippers and when the tide is in, it looks beautiful. You can also spot all sorts of birds including pelicans.This is a good place for a leisurely stroll, a bike ride or a run. There’s outdoor exercise stations that can be used if you’re keen to have an outdoor workout! And there are plenty of areas to sit, relax and perhaps enjoy a picnic or bbq"
195,Charity Walk,"The esplanade is a beautiful boardwalk overlooking the sea, it has a flock of pelicans that always live there, you can take amazing pictures during sunrise, Theres parks and BBQ facilities all free."
196,Lovely walk and view,"It’s a nice walk, easy access for prams but very hot later in the day and not covered. A good way to see Cairns!"
197,"Great walk, always plenty to see","Not just a path to your destination - a great ocean-side avenue ... where the journey is more beautiful than the destination.See walkers, joggers, exercisers, dogs. picnickers in the parks ... and more.Lots of viewing spots along the way to snap pics and see the boats come and go."
198,Well laid out,I am always looking for a good place to get a morning run in while on vacation and the Esplanade Boardwalk is just that. Wide bike and run lanes with additional outdoor exercise equipment nearby. The views are great as well.
199,Beautiful boardwalk,We went for a leisurely stroll to stretch out legs from travelling. Very beautiful and well thought out. Can get busy at times. Lots of seating and shade but still bring sunblock - we both got burnt in under an hour on a shady day. Beautiful spot.
200,Refreshing and Relaxing,Awesome walking track that is well looked after by the council. We are staying the the Lakes Resort in Cairns North and this path allows use the walk from the resort all the way straight into the Esplanade
201,Lovely by the sea,We stayed in North Cairns and enjoyed walking the Esplanade on most days. The walk is easy with great views of the harbour. All along the way is different parks and a cafe which is perfect when your tired and in need of a coffee. A must do if your in Cairns.
202,Lovely walk into town,Incredibly clean and lovely walk from the north cairns sporting grounds all the way to the CBD. So much availability for activities. Just keep an eye out for Crocs (ample signs to warn you).
203,Favourite of ours for 20 years,"We stayed on the Esplanade, what a wonderful experience. We walked & walked, enjoying all that Cairns offered ! 🌟"
204,Great walk,Fantastic safe boardwalk. We walk every morning and it was a pleasure to hot the boardwalk in the morning. Then the evenings were beautiful watching people backing and just entertaining - loved it
205,Boardwalk,"The Cairns Esplanade boardwalk has lots to offer 24hrs in all seasons. The views in all directions are splendid, whether the tide is in or the mud flats visible on low tide every angle is picturesque. There are plenty of dining options and parking is free on Sundays.  The grounds were well maintained and free of litter and the amenities, located next to the children's playground were clean. The sculptures of the stingray and fish provided a professional appeal and great backdrop for selfies and vessels moored close by reminded you that sailing the Great Barrier Reef must be added to your lust of things to do."
206,Lovely walk,Strolled along the board walk mid to early morning. Very peaceful and quite. Lots of restaurants etc.
207,GREAT PLACE TO WALK,"What a fabulous place along the Esplanade boardwalk at Cairns.The mangroves have been removed , however the beauty of the massive tidal movements is a sight to see. When tide is low the muddy flats are a birdwatchers delight with many bird species probing the rich sediments for food. A resident flock of pelicans makes great viewing, as the esplanade boardwalk is raised they are unafraid of people viewing from above. The views across the waters are a delight at sunrise and sunset. At night the esplande is lit up and many people walk up and down ."
208,"Esplanade, Cairns","The Esplanade is 2.5 kilometres long and is a great walk. There are lanes for cyclists but most people walk or jog.Lots of birds along the waters edge, especially as the tide comes in. They have made some improvements since we last visited 5 years ago, more information boards about birds and wildlife in general. Good parking."
209,Beautiful stroll,"Such a beautiful clean safe place to walk. We arrived in the evening, booked in and went directly down to the boardwalk. It was dark and drizzling but the area was well lit with beautifully lit features showing the history of each point of interest. People were jogging and walking until late in the evening. No beggars or people to harass us. The next morning we walked again. Beautiful gyms along the walk. Manicured lawns and a lovely huge spotless clear blue lagoon type swimming pool....with a lifeguard and beach type feel. You cannot swim in the beach parallel to the boardwalk as it is more of a tidal mud area. The pool We think was  chlorinated not salt, but spotlessly clean. Lots of sea birds grazing in the mud, and ever so pretty when the tide came in. Photos are on the camera still, but we watched lovely u tube footage on Cairns before our trip which showed everything we saw."
210,Good for a casual stroll,Extremely clean nice walk on boardwalk to marina. Lovely when green and beautiful tropics plants Very quiet but nice to see places open
211,Lovely walk,"Nice walk along a muddy bed, since the ocean doesn't come in to the shore anymore. The fig trees are impressive!"
212,Effortless Walk!,"We walked along the boardwalk from our accommodation near the marina, down to Muddy’s, which is a great park. Everything is clean and easily accessible. I walked the boardwalk with a baby and my six year old and had no issues."
213,Good for just relaxing and people watching,Gorgeous boardwalk which seems to stretch on forever! After over eating for our entire trip the boardwalk poses as a good excuse to exercise and burn off all of those calories!!
214,Buzzing evening stroll,"We went on the esplanade a few times during our stay in Cairns, it was nice with a lagoon and a grassy area where you can sunbathe and a lot of nice restaurant around and shopping center."
215,Something for Everyone,"Hats off to those who developed this tourism destination. This area has become a true tourist destination with outstanding BBQ facilities and a swim area that would rival the best in Australia. Clean water with beautiful white sandy areas, a children's swim area coupled with a really well-designed Adult 1.5m area makes this a real go-to for couples families and just groups of teenagers wanting to relax and soak up the sun. Toilet and change room facilities are well maintained and a cafe just sets it off. Ample seating and grass areas with trees throughout really create a resort-type feel. This is a must."
216,I Knew What to Expect ,A great place to take a stroll and even listen to some buskers making music. There is always a buzz around
217,Holiday Walk,Landing in Cairns this is the first place you must see.  Don’t miss the displays of local history and geography or the pelicans on the beach.
218,Great walk particularly nice in the evening,"Just had a great weekend in Shanklin beautiful place reminded me of England of old . Plenty of lovely places to eat very friendly people. So relaxing we did all the things we did when at the seaside years ago fish and chips ice cream and crazy golf. Then we visited the toilets at seafront behind crazy golf, never have I seen such neglect. The fact that someone is still replacing toilet roll in this building is beyond me. The place should be shut down until refurbed."
219,Awesome walks,Nice place to cool off in the summer. It’s very large so it did not feel crowded at all.Plenty of benches and picnic tables with lifeguards and shade. Great for families.
220,Place to relax and good for walks,"A well planned and managed precinct with boardwalk, pool, volleyball, skating, cycle pathways, kids play areas, exercise equipment, markets, cafes....great atmosphere..people out running and walking..having fun. You can't not visit if you are in Cairns."
221,Awesome spot for all ages,"Our hotel was on the Esplanade so it was was a breeze to just come out and start walking. Can be busy at times but the mornings and evenings are a nice time to walk around. Well laid out walkways and a beautiful pool for all ages to enjoy, life guard on duty.  Also lots of good eateries and shops right on the Esplanade Street."
222,Nice place ,This boardwalk had been improved heaps in then last 10 years since our last family visit. Great way to stroll into Cairns on a balmy June night - greta vibe.
223,One of the best!,"Superb, don’t you miss it. Perfect to visit in the afternoon, fel the breeze from the lagoon. Walk or bicycle, let your kids play."
224,A great asset to the Cairns area,This is a great run spot in Cairns. Cool and relatively flat with markers to indicate how far you have gone every 500m. Recommend starting at the pirate ship to Fogarty park and back. Mornings are usually cool with less traffic. Later in the day it is too busy with locals and tourists
225,Stunning,"You cannot go to Cairns without walking the esplanade.  Lined, in places, with restaurants where you can sit out and eat a meal.  Lovely walkway."
226,Lovely walk on a beautiful day,"The boardwalk is a great and under-mentioned feature of Cairns. Running the length of the bay, it's for everyone, except those on bikes, skates, etc. With the sea on one side and a grassed area on the other with lots of restaurants it would be easy to spend several hours here. We were in Cairns in early November and the boardwalk was lined with friendly birdwatchers keenly observing the waders as the tide came in. There's a group of pelicans resident at the marina end but go north and there are few people (or facilities) around but take notice that crocodiles have been seen up here."
227,World famous shore bird haven ,Actually went the full length and was amazed at the playgrounds and green areas down the end.  We also then spent a lovely night in the cool air eating a pizza.  So many BBQs and tables spread out along the esplanade and the lagoon makes a nice place for families etc to swim for free without the danger of stingers etc  Walking boardwalk is great and can be used by wheelchairs etc with ease
228,Birdwatchers delight,"Good walk to get out but really not that scenic or anything special. If you bored and in Cairns then sure do it, but don’t go out your way to make time for it. See my pics to judge for yourself."
229,Best Spot in Cairns,"The Cairns Esplanade Boardwalk is one any coastal town would be proud to have. Between the boardwalk walking track on the water’s edge, and the lined walking and cycling track, is lush green grass and stunning trees between which barbecue and work-out locations are scattered.The barbecue areas are large and undercover with seating areas nearby, perfect for a family lunch.Each workout area along the trail features unique workout machines with instructions, perfect for a morning workout session jogging between each of the locations for a new workout.Unfortunately with the shallow gradient of the coast, more often than not anything but high tide leaves the waters edge more of a muddy swamp, attracting pelicans and ibises to congregate along the sporadic streams that remain.It’s a great walk to have, and if staying anywhere along the Esplanade you will find yourself quickly frequenting it to get around."
230,Wonderful Walk way,"When you visit Cairns you must take a walk along the boardwalk along the esplanade in Cairns. There are several BBQ's supplied by the council free to use for the impromptu sausage sizzle :) . There are exercise machines along the way for fitness fanatics..The southern  end runs into the lagoon..  If you are not a walker, there is bicycle hire in the city.."
231,Lovely walk,But the walk on the grass is nice. Curiously there is an incorporated cemetery. There are also some interesting historical references to WWII.
232,Focal point in Cairns,"Lovely area, however most times the tide is out till after dark, so only mud flats, but the surrounding pools and restaurants etc makes it a lovely area"
233,Lovely Walk,Spent a long weekend in Cairns lots to in and out of Cairns. A lovely stroll here is worth the visit. Highly recommend this place to visit.
234,"Plenty to look at, lush tropical plants one side, the sea the other",This is a good place too take a walk and then stop for some food or coffee at one of the restaurants nearby.
235,Great way to start your dsy,"There is always something to watch as you wander down the boardwalk.We walked early morning lunch late afternoon and late in the evening. Everyone something different was happening,  wether the big wheel. Helicopters arriving and leaving at the far end, people fun colours bicycles with lights at night, exercise equipment and more.Plenty of shade under great big strangular figs.Watch out for bird droppings during the day and bats at night.Its free, ita simple, it's relaxing."
236,Nice area to wander,"No matter the time of day the Esplanade Boardwalk is buzzing, a great place for an evening stroll, sit and watch the world go by, watch the waters wildlife at low and high tides, stop at the huge playground, stop for a swim in the pool, there is so much to see and do whilst walking the Boardwalk.  Just across the road you a spoilt for choice with cafes, restaurants, night markets and shops!"
237,Lovely walk,The Cairns Boardwalk is Beautiful from start to finish. Its an attraction in its self. We were in Cairns only for 8 days and we walked the boardwalk at least 4 times. A great spot for Stunning pictures
238,Lovely Place,"You know that you are in a tropical city when you explore the boardwalk at your doorstep. A real credit to the city of Cairns. Well maintained and safe at all times. Families can enjoy the many playgrounds or the huge lake/pool which also has lifeguards on duty. We walk this everyday during our visit. Whether you want a gentle stroll or a long walk with stops at the outdoor exercise facilities, something for everyone. Also great bird watching area."
239,Easy walking - with great parks and cafe.,"The Esplanade is a favourite place in Cairns. The gardens are tropical and very well kept. It's a popular location for locals and visitors.Glorious views of the hills, city scape and the water.There are skate parks, water parks, exercise stations, bbq's, seats, cafes and more to be found along the way. A must stroll location in Cairns."
240,Relaxing,"We walked from Lily street right around to the Wharf One Cafe, about 3klms. Was easy to park near Lily street.Interesting historical and natural stuff to read along the walk, as well as various activities for those so inclined. We jus enjoyed a nice flat walk"
241,Boardwalk along the mud,"Tranquil, beautiful, clean, restful, just great really. Cairns council has fantastic employees who take pride in their amazing town, well done."
242,What A Great Place To Visit,"Make this one of your first places to visit, high or low tide. Always something of interest for everyone be it birds, boats, activities, walking, biking, scooting or running ...For keen birdwatchers many migratory species, as well as residents, may be observed dependent on the tide and season.The esplanade is quieter at the northern end, towards the middle, closer to cafes and restaurants and at the southern end lots of activity with The Lagoon and beach, a starting point for reef trips, and tourist shopping."
243,Great for people watching,Lovely walk along the waters edge on a balmy evening. Best done at dusk at this time of year. Check out the mudskippers and crabs at low tide.
244,Pleasant to walk,What a truly beautiful place the Esplanade is.  It has been planned so well and caters for all ages.  From children playgrounds to exercise equipment to the beautiful boardwalk walking area.  Let’s not forget the big pool either.
245,Relaxing walk,Very nice wooden walkway. Clean and well taken care of.  It extend almost the whole Esplanade. Plenty of room for walkers and bikers.
246,Wonderful sights,"every time coming in cairns we love to go for walk ,after dinner with ice cream on hand it very nice"
247,Two sides to Shanklin,"Clean  ,  lots of info boards , plenty of space , km markers , exercises equipment.  Trip advisor wants me to write more though pretty much covers it"
248,Cape York trip,"Cairns City Council should take a bow. Well done. Very well done actually. The whole area is welcoming, green, relaxing and right opposite restaurants and next to the ocean. 👍👍👍👍"
249,nice walk,A pleas t stroll that can be as long or as short as you want. Visit at varying tide time to see a wide range of natural life. Leafy areas to take shade in and a great range of activities for all ages
250,Walks,Was up for business and took a walk along the esplanade in the early evening. Lovely walking along with the sea breeze.
251,A beautiful walk at any time of the day,A few great playgrounds plus a basketball court and climbing wall. Towards the city centre there is also a great water play area. Perfect place to kids anytime of year. We were visiting during the mild rainy period so we’re grateful for this boardwalk and all it offers.
252,A pretty walk,Intresting thing to be seen from buskers to a big wheel and the Iconic Fish thingies on the posts in the pool.
253,Lovely place for a walk,"If you want to stretch legs or just drain in the place, walk the length of the boardwalk any time although first and last thing in the day is best.  Nicely presented and a safe walk."
254,Nice area,"the esplanade boardwalk is the essence of Cairns. From parklands to the city, people of all ages come here to exercise, stroll and people watch. Exercise stations for the older folk, muddys water play and playground for the little ones, skate ramps, basketball court and volley ball for the more active, this part of Cairns is the best part of Cairns"
255,"Excellent boardwalk, parklands and playgrounds ","We walked this boardwalk nearly every morning & evening while in Cairns. It's 8.6 km long, so whether you're interested in a long or short walk, you will have plenty of space to explore. There are many bathrooms/toilets that are clean along the Esplanade. We loved Muddy's cafe that's right on the Esplanade for coffee, breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Many locals also enjoy the Esplanade for a morning jog, the outdoor gyms, and/or bike rides. It's easy to figure out and just wander & enjoy all the birds (wild parrots to pelicans)."
256,Nice,"I didn't have high expectations as it is only a boardwalk along a shoreline but I do have to admit it was a nice stroll. It is always relaxing being directly beside the ocean as you wander but there isn't a great deal to view. We did 2 walks, morning and evening and I felt the sunset walk was by far better, the afternoon breeze helped, along with the sunset but apart from that I would only recommend this walk as a time filler, there are better and more interesting walks around Cairns"
257,A delight for any tpurist,It’s not uber busy here in October; but we had a lovely day ambling around Cairns and all along the Esplanade.  It was lovely to see a children’s park area well cared for and well used in a nicely shaded area where clearly some time and thought had been out into it.Great seating along the way to take regular breaks if you need them and places for drinks and or meals too.  You walk passed the swimming pool which again was well maintained and used.  Even outdoor BBQ’s available and in use.  Lovely by day and safe by night too!
258,Very relaxing,"If you are staying in Cairns central area, the Esplanade is just a pleasant short walk away. Very relaxing and there is a waterpark along the way which is great for kids. Lots of cafes to choose from and public toilets near the waterpark. Great activity day and evening."
259,Great Walking Place,"It had been 30 years since our last visit. The waterfront then wasn’t very attractive, but what a change now.  A very nice place for an early morning or evening walk. A good place for buskers on the weekend too. Had nade a world of difference to the town."
260,Activity everywhere,"My favourite time to walk (total 5 klm round trip) is early morning especially at sunrise. Watch the sunrise over the water/mountains. A great place located in the city and you can:Easy stroll,Exercise by walking or jogging,Walk you dog on a lead,Ride your bike on the seperate bike way,Play Pétanque, Famous for bird watching,Children’s waterpark, Swim at Cairns Lagoon,Sit under a shady tree in a large green space,Skate park,Play beach volleyball,Play tennis,Weekend markets,Muddy Cafe to sit relax and watch the boats go by,Restaurants,Buskers,Children’s Playground,Sheltered barbecues,And more.... and it’s FREE 🙂"
261,Nice,"You can tell Cairns is very proud place. There Esplanade is so well manicure, green, clean and super looked after."
262,Excellent experience ,"Lovely area. Restaurants, shops, art gallery.........worth a visit. There is soo much to see and do in Cairns. Great restaurants too."
263,Best!!,Spent our holidays in Cairns. Loved being able to walk along the boardwalk late into the afternoon. An after dinner walk is an enjoyable way to scenery.
264,Relaxing,The Esplanade Boardwalk is lovely. Our accommodation was a little further out right on the harbour so every morning we walked along the boardwalk in to main area of Cairns for breakfast and back again before planning our day. Great walk and plenty of friendly people. Plenty of birdlife in and around the water.
265,Its got it all,"Most people find Cairns a very hot and humid place so go for your walk in the late afternoon along the boardwalk.  Make sure you bring your swim suit as well (not for the beach as there are crocodiles about) but for the fabulous swimming lagoon right on the boardwalk.I am not a good swimmer so was delighted to find out there was only one spot that was only just over my head (I am 5 foot 6 inches).When walking on the boardwalk make sure you go down to the southern end near where the helicopter lands to see the giant mud skippers.  In Moreton Bay near Brisbane where I live I have only ever seen mud skippers that are at most 3 inches long, the ones here in Cairns are huge, some about 8 inches long.We also saw lots of lovely crabs on the mud/sand flats at the boardwalk, not to mention the many pelicans and at sunset there are tons of different birds flying around which we loved.There is a great coffee shop at the Southern end of the boardwalk just past the helipad.  They have large lounges that you can actually lay on.  Coffee is good and great atmosphere too."
266,Lovely area to take a walk,Walked up and down this a bit while we were there.   Very popular with a lot of people.   Interesting to see the pelicans camped out on the sand at low tide.   Nice to have places to sit when you got tired or just wanted to sit.   Lots of activity.
267,Walking,"This is perfect price (free) we all enjoyed a seim in the lagoon and my 10 yo couldn't get enough of it. The location is the best. Night market (which is also really cool) boardwalk with pelicans and  breathtaking views, a play ground, fresh juice bars and do much more"
268,Very pleasant landscaping,"We really enjoyed Cairns and wished that we could have spent additional time here.  The city is very beautiful with a great boardwalk along the marina/harbor that has a number of restaurants.  There are also additional restaurants in the city area with shops.  The Cairns Esplanade Lagoon (large pool) is also situated along the waterfront and this area was also very charming with plenty of shops, restaurants and upscale resorts."
269,Good for the waistline?,I walked all along the boardwalk and I thought it was fantastic. I was amazed at the amount of crabs I saw.
270,A walk to remember!,An excellent innovation that neatly blends all the direct coastal areas into one smooth experience. I commenced it just after the cruise ship terminal and continued along past all the nice bars and restaurants on the left and the terminals for the small cruise catamarans and the fishing boats etc on the right. Then some lovely parkland area and you arrive at Muddy’s playground.  Lots for all and with a beautiful ambience as you stroll. You will also come across the War Memorial and a memorial to the original modern Olympic sports.
271,Go for a walk when it's cool and the tide is in,Came here for a chill day near the pool and that's just what we got! It was an enjoyable afternoon laying by the pool and getting the water.
272,Nice walk,"Great food locations.  For breakfast let me suggest the Coffee Club and get the avocado toast.  Because Cairns does not have a close beach, hang out in the lagoon for some water time.  If you're into running, get out early and run the esplanade.  The sunrise is magical and will inspire you."
273,good place to people watch and wander,"Visited Cairns for a weekend while visiting Australia for a couple week on business.The boardwalk area is so nice and I can’t wait to bring my family back someday. There’s so much to do; parks, pool, restaurants, recreation, live performers, beautiful views! At low tide during the day you can see mudskippers and crabs in the mudflats and tons of birds and other wildlife all around. Busy area, lots of people walking and about. Good fun"
274,Weekend visit,"Always something going on, A good way to bump into interesting people from all over the world and have a chat"
275,Grab an early morning coffee and enjoy the views!,"Walking along here is like wqlking along some sort of magical dividing path or road... on one side is a vast,empty expanse of nothing but ocean and maybe a few bobbing boats and islands... and on the other is a wondrous array of lush gardens and swimming lagoons with happy, smiling people and beyond that a world of busy shops and markets full of others rushing to get their chores and tasks done for the day.......  a truly fantastic place......"
276,Nice wall,"We did one end of the Esplanade to the other and back for a charity walk for the anti ice campaign. It’s an easy walk with great scenery. There is water fountains if you need a drink, plenty of seats if you need a rest and even a cafe on the walk. Would recommend for anyone even people in wheelchairs could do it easy."
277,"Well lit at night, plenty of restaurants","This place was great. It was clean and I always felt safe walking around, both during the day and at night. People around were really nice as well. There is a huge pool to go swimming in. There are a ton of places to workout, as well as places for kids to play. This was a really nice family friendly area. I wish more cities had safe havens like this."
278,Rachel McAllister ,"Whenever I’m lucky enough to be in Cairns, I head here for a run with the sea breeze. The whole length of the esplanade is beautifully maintained and there are water stops all the way along. It’s a joy to run with the ocean at your side and you don’t need any music, as there is so much people watching to do. Don’t miss it!"
279,Great place to experience the vibe of cairns,"Even though Cairns has no obvious speech, but large long flat mudflats going out to sea, this is a lovely way to enjoy this area. It is scenic, and in nice weather has pelicans, other waterbirds, exercise machines, great amenities, and a wonderful children's playground towards the northern end. As a tourist town, across the not so busy road, there are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, and other places to see and visit for refreshments."
280,lovely for a day or night walk,What a great walk and I stop for coffee at muddy cafe so beautiful few days later I came back had fish and chips yummo
281,Relaxing downtime,"Went to 2 restaurants at night, one cafe for iced coffee n cake and one pub for cocktail n beer in  afternoon, all lovely. Walked around esplanade, went to cold rock down to park where 2 men with guitars sang, great. At night."
282,Great Walk,Load and loads of Things to do and see. if you like icecream or gelato you're in luck. This place is really worth the walk. Pick a time when you can stop for a meal along the way. Very relaxing and a great place to spend time especially when you've got nothing else on. Wear good shoes for walking.
283,Lovely place for a quiet drink or three,"Cairns is in the tropics and can get hot quickly so suggest you go for a walk early in the morning (if it’s not raining which it frequently can do in Cairns).  The scenery will be more enjoyable if the tide is in, otherwise you will see loads of mudflats.  Lots to look at along the way – parks, gardens, sculptures, people exercising and on the other side of the road are shop and cafes."
284,Average - nothing special. ,"We stayed on the Esplanade and absolutely loved it.  Every morning we did the Esplanade walk then stopped for breakfast on the way back.  The Lagoon area is fantastic with it's beach and fantastic seeing so many families enjoying the outdoors.  So many places to eat and drink.  We visit Bali every year however we have now decided Cairns is our new destination cause it is so clean, people are so nice and the temperature around August and September is fabulous."
285,Beautiful ,"In July of 2019 I went on a very expensive dive trip that took me through Cairns, while in Cairns I remained out of the water so of course needed to occupy myself with some attractions on the land. I am one for walks along the boardwalk or down the road for Ice cream, lucky me Cairns seems to have the most killer boardwalk esplanade as well as about 10 Ice cream joints open late!I began my trip at the nearest park, this included a self contained basketball court, multiple volleyball courts, an extensive skate park and other attractions all getting some serious use by the local youth demographic, this was great to see! Instead of feeling like I might get mugged I had a ball roll over to me and had a polite young man gesture for the catch and thank me. Other cities and townships could learn much from Cairns and what they  done here.But this of course was the start of my walk! I am only metres into an extensive journey!I continued past these attractions to and on towards the Marina and that hard earned Ice Cream. As I passed rock climbing walls, the longest and extensive kids playground I have seen, water fountains designed to play in, a cafe in the park, more playgrounds and workout areas  all being heavily used, the foreshore is just inhabited by good vibes and people enjoying life! As I continue nearing the end along what cant really be called a beach I realise that I have been so occupied with these wonderful ideas put into place I forgot to check the beach out which was lucky as there is just rocks and water lacking the actual sand it seems. This can be ignored because at the end of this boardwalk there is the lagoon! A glorious substitute for the beach, a pool with sand and seemingly the remaining population of Cairns. In the end I made 3 trips within the one night because I loved the walk and only 2 of these were under the guise of getting Ice Cream 👌👌👌"
286,Maddison ,"It seems a little prosaic that such an apparently minor activity, a walk by the sea, should rate a Trip Avisor rating of its own but in this case it is well-justified. Around 2 km has been beautifully created, part boardwalk, part tarmac, part pedestrian, part cyclist. All next to well-tended garden or other public amenities. Popular with people who want to keep fit, especialy before and after work. The possibility of seeing birdlife especially next to the 'sea' whch at low tide are mudflats with wading birds. Various informative panels of information along the way. You'll be unlikely to do this walk only once!"
287,Lots of activity!,I knew what to expect here as I was informed before I came.  It's just mud flaps and obviously you cannot swim safely.  The council has done a great job beautifying the parks along side the the esplanade.  Worth a walk but don't expect it to be like Moreton Bay.
288,Nice walk ,"A great facility, pity about the swampy mud that is adjacent to it most of the time, and very little shade"
289,"A beautiful, relaxing and scenic natural walk in the winter dry season.","We didn’t have any plans today so got the kids on the scooters and in the pram and went for a walk from north cairns down to the lagoon. It’s an easy flat walking path the whole way along the waters edge (or ages from the waters edge at low tide). There is a skate park, volleyball, plenty of green space, the hospital helicopter 🚁 pad (where you can see the rescue chopper land from 10m away), kids water fountains, Muddy’s cafe, play equipment, adult exercise equipment, cafes and restaurants, a bit of history and information, and the lagoon and the southern end. Plenty enough to do for a couple good morning activities leading into lunch."
290,Beautiful views,"whenever we stay in Cairns we make a point of finding accommodation close to the Esplanade, and always take a morning stroll along the Boardwalk. On occasion we also do an evening stroll and choose a restaurant from the many and varied places across the road from the Boardwalk for dinner"
291,Beautiful walk,"Cannot praise the esplanade enough, as a local who pays for the esplanade through taxes and rates, love it. Free for tourists to use, what is not to love?"
292,Cairns made attractive ,"Fantastic peaceful walk with other early risers. Walked later in the day and was disappointed in some of the behaviour. Drunken , loud groups and felt unsafe. Needs a patrol  especially around the lagoon where a few odd characters hang around. Even observed a guy with a go pro in the lagoon filming underwater while walking along, creepy."
293,Esplanade/boardwalk,"My wife and I have visited the Esplanade many times over the years, being both keen birdwatchers there’s always something of interest. Each year we visit we notice the improvements that have been made. The foreshore is still superb for Birds, Australian Pelican, Sharp-tailed Sandpiper, Great Knot and Red-necked Stint to name but a few. New exercise areas have been put in place since our last visit, lots more seating sensibly placed in the shade. There are plenty of opportunities to snack, drink, dine and if so inclined, swim in the Lido. A great place to spend a couple of hours. Free Parking at the North End only. Highly Recommended"
294,Nice Walkway,First back to Cairns in 35 years and great to see so much has improved and for the better ...very pleasant stroll
295,Relaxing 😎 ,Excellent experience. We wanted more and more. Time passed too quickly. Next time we're in the area we'll certainly be back for more of a good thing. And we'll pass around the word to others!
296,few days away,We stayed in the Doubletree Hotel on the Esplanade and our room was facing the Esplanade. So we had a gorgeous view of the pier and the Esplanade boardwalk. We would go for walks in the evening and morning. Plenty of restaurants to pick for lunch or dinner. Nice location.
297,wow it has it all,This was added to the Esplanade as a trial from 30 August-1 December 2019 and I did it 3 times  during its run (night and day for the different views). It’s likely to be back again next year in peak tourist season. I thought it was good value for $10 as you get over 10 minutes in the capsule (which spins) and nice views over Cairns and Trinity Inlet. It stops up the top for a minute or so as well so you can take in the views.Features of the Reef Eye:35 metres tall700 people per hour capacity360 degree rotating gondolasFully enclosed gondolasLED light show at nightOperates 7 days per week 10am-10pm
298,Great opportunity to enjoy,"Do yourself a favour, get yourself an early morning coffee, take a walk along the esplanade and enjoy the sunrise and views over the water. They are to die for!"
299,Great public pool. Well done to Council 👍,"If you've got a lot of money you can stay on the Cairns Esplanade but you don't need to pay for a room to spend the day with a cool breeze under blossoming trees and giant figs. You can walk for 4km along a waterfront at low tide with water birds and high tide with pelicans and jumping fish or cook a meal on one of the free to public barbecues as you experience the tropical twilight .Need a gym, use one of the exercise stations, ride a bike, beach volleyball, jog with the locals or just sit and read a book. The whole city uses this room and its the best in town. I know  I go everyday."
