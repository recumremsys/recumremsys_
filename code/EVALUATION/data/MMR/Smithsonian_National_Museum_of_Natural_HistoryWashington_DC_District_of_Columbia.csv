0,This is the Jewel BOX of America!,Many of the most important works that we Americans have on loan or otherwise are so elegantly held here.Very peaceful way to spend a couple of hours every day ypu are visiting DC
1,Not to compare with AMNH in NY but worth to visit.,This museum houses many of America's treasures. There is something for everyone: a mix of artifacts for intellectuals and popular culture. Give yourself at least 2 hours because the museum is huge!
2,Maybe too high expectations ,A must-see if you’re in Washington DC.  This is truly a great museum that has many high quality items that are really well presented...  and it’s free to the public.  You can easily spend a day making your through museum.  We visited in early September and we were surprised that there was no wait to get in the museum and the museum was not crowded.
3,Nice and Secure,"We love this museum! It has so many wonderful things to see and and enjoy. Young or old, it's a must do on your list. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Crowded and not unusual enough to prioritize in DC,"This is always a fun museum for those who are fascinated by nature. The Minerals are lways great and the new fossil exhibit is very good. They don't have the extensive NYC fossil collection, of course, but it is still well worth an hour or two. Bottom line, now that we are solidly in the Anthropocene age, everybody should take an interest in the world around us."
5,Adventure Through Natural History,Don't miss this must see museum.  Very well done exhibits and phenomenal specimens of our natural world.  Something for everyone.
6,Bring an Empty Memory Card,National Museum of Natural History is a must visit museum while in DC. Their exhibits are spectacular. So much informative placards to read through and audio & visual presentations to participate in. You can spend several days browsing and still wouldn’t be enough time to see everything. The National Gem Gallery has the Hope Diamond on display. An awesome museum and it’s free. But be ready for lots of noisy student groups in the museum daily.
7,free and very good,This place is crammed with wonderful exhibits. All aspects of life on this planet were represented and we particularly enjoyed the Dinosaur displays.
8,A Great Natural History Museum,This is one of many must see museums in the Nation's Capital. Being a Marylander we take these venues way too much for granted. It has been a while since I had visited and this time I took my grandchildren who loved it. The new displays and up grades are excellent and the interactive sections for children great. There is bag screening so you will wait a bit in line especially at 10 when the building opens. It is no worse than an amusement park so take a breathe and relax. You will enjoy your visit I guarantee you.
9,Lovely option for a fun day of gaining knowledge ,"There are many Smithsonian Museum in Washington but the Natural History Museum is the wonderful place to visit..It shows the evolution of Man,animals and the earth in a beautiful way.there is a separate Dianasaur section so good.. this i think the no 1 tourist place"
10,Love a free museum,Best museum I’ve ever visited! So much information in so many different and interesting formats to keep everyone interested and enthralled. Definitely one for the “must visit” list.
11,Great place,"We spend a few good hours in here. Free entrance as well. It has something for everyone! Great collection, wasnt that crowded either"
12,Well worth a visit,"We enjoyed several hours of colorful and informative exhibits at this Museum. There's little or no parking in the downtown DC area, so its best to take the metro in and just make the short walk."
13,Excellent museum for all ages,"This museum is fantastic and a must see.  I enjoyed the marine, dinosaur, and jewel exhibits especially.  And don't forget to see the Hope Diamond!"
14,A Great Day! ,"I was excited to see the Hope Diamond and other natural treasures. Unfortunately, this museum is in need of some TLC. We found it to be a bit outdated especially the restrooms. Also overrun with small children the day we were there."
15,New updated Smithsonian ,"I have a special interest in minerals and have visited mineral exhibits all over the world.  This one is the best.  Displays are state-of-the-art with superb lighting and labeling.  Outstanding gems are here.  The emeralds, topazes, and diamonds are particularly good.  The Hope Diamond is displayed in its own room and is worth it.  Recreated mine settings are well done.    Great for kids of all ages.  I easily spent 2 hours here."
16,Overwhelming and big but worth seeing a gallery at a time,"Such an amazing place to visit in DC. So much to feel and learn about Ametican art and history. Feel like  coming again and again it's so beautiful and attractive in it's own way. Painting  pieces of art,  sculptures are breathtaking. Can spend hours and hours in the Museum. Cafeteria is an addition to its beauty."
17,"great place, lots of info, but beware of the kids (noise)","Visited several Smithsonian museums, this was our favorited. The fossil and dinosaur rooms were remarkable. Spent about two and a half hours, should allow more time. Also interesting were some of the older exhibits which effectively displayed the questionable ethics of earlier archeology."
18,"A ""can't miss"" museum  for naturalists of all ages.","It's free as it's a Smithsonian Museum. It's very popular with families and children and is very child friendly. The dinosaur and geology exhibits seemed to be the best areas from my perspective. There are very few if any actual fossils on display - they are mostly casts of originals. But this does not detract from the visit as it's an excellent exhibition. In the geology area they actually have quite a bit of very expensive jewellery including the Hope Diamond (bit dull actually though could be due to how it's displayed) and Marie Antoinette's earrings - well the diamonds from them anyway. But some of the quartz, topaz,  meteorites and other minerals are actually more impressive to look at than the Hope Diamond etc. so take your time over these. Quite colourful and some glow in the dark! They also have some moon rocks on display of course. This area is quieter than the dino area but still fairly busy.Better than some other natural history museums I've visited in the past but this one may just be more state of the art, and the others may also have been revamped in a similar way. Didn't bother too much with the stuffed animal bits. But there were fewer than I was expecting and I've seen elsewhere. These museums have I think moved away from just being a large storehouse of stuffed animals and rather boringly exhibited rocks in recent years."
19,Tons to see,My son and I visited the Museum of Natural History on our visit to DC.  The museum has a wonderful collection of dinosaur fossils presented in a very engaging manner.  There is also a large collection of taxidermy animals from all over the planet.  Those two exhibits are some of the most fascinating parts of the museum in my experience.  Of course the main attraction of the museum is the Hope Diamond.  It is a 45.52 carat diamond with an exotic and glamorous history.  It is reputed to have come from India; some even claim there is a curse on the jewel.  It used to belong to King Louis XIV of France.  It was stole and recut at one point.  The story is very interesting and is recounted in the exhibit.The museum is definitely worth a visit if you are in DC.  I highly recommend it.
20,Not to miss,"This is a great museum for people of all ages! And if you have a little one in your family, I think this could work for you!"
21,Beautifully Extensive,"And this was a treasure of a tour. We highly recommend it. It can be for larger corporate groups as well as more intimate groups like church groups and family reunions.  Our hosts were incredibly knowledgeable, excellent communicators, and flexible. And best of all just plain personable and fun. The focus was to uncover the rich forgotten African American history of the area. We met our hosts and travelled in their SUV for 3 to 4 hours all around the city of Dallas. Cemeteries and vibrant neighborhoods, hotels and places in the Green Book featured in the movie by the same name, and so much more were seen along the way. The final stop was at the African American Museum which helped in pulling it all together. We highly recommend this activity."
22,Fun Museum to visit!,This is a must see on a trip to DC. We both found it fascinating and enjoyed all the exhibits You don't get much for free these days so drop in - you'll be really glad you did.
23,Why? It’s Science!!!,This museum was pretty cool and I think it is very well organized. I enjoyed my time here and we especially liked spending time with the butterflies and the opportunity to hold insects and watch a tarantula being fed. The staff is very kind and helpful. My only wish is that I had more time at the museum but I plan to return.
24,Enjoyed my time,"While it didn’t make me weepy as the American History Museum did, it is still a great free museum for anyone interested in nature and the Earth. Take time to see it if you can while you are there. Many cities make you pay for similar, not as good facilities. 2013 visit for me."
25,"Great place, a little dated",Love this museum. The history shown here is very educational. Go on time in order to view all levels. So much to learn and appreciate.
26,Captivating experience!,"This is a wonderful place to get away from Washington politics. There is no entrance fee, to this, one of my top two favourite museums in the USA. The displays are beautiful and many massive, including one of the world’s largest real Tyrannosaurus Rex skeletons."
27,Breathtakingly Curated,"Although the gem and rock collection is amazing, I am not a fan of stuffed animals.  But all of the exhibits are interesting and well laid out."
28,A lot of amazing artifacts ,"From the National Museum of American History to the National Archives, there is something for everyone here. Carefully curated and expertly preserved, the exhibits are informative and beautiful. Be sure to wear good walking shoes and carry as little as possible. There is a lot of walking and each museum has a security checkpoint at the entrances. The museums are for all to enjoy and they are free of charge. Allow yourself plenty of time to truly explore."
29,Butterfly Exhibit and Insect Live instructions,A great museum. Lots of interesting stuff from the Hope Diamond to animal skeletons. A wonderful for kids and adults with cool and well-organized exhibits. You can spend hours reading stories behind the precious jewels. You will be amazed by the magnificent rocks. Especially the fluorite rocks. The only disappointment was that the skeletons were made out of plastic.
30,great place to spend some hours,The National Museum of African American History and Culture was AMAZING!!! I will be visiting again because there is so much information that I need more than one visit to get the full experience!!!
31,Best activities to do in Washington,"The refurbished museum is a fantastic, world class exhibits, so much interesting stuff. Certainly lives up to the hype."
32,Well worth a visit. ,Just to say that this is a very impressive museum. So much to see and do - you need a while in this place. My kids loved it and the exhibits are really fab.
33,Really cool and it's FREE!,"Wonderful museum, and well worth your visit. So much to look at, to read about, you need a half day here at the least. The displays are fabulous and interesting. There is a cafeteria on site, but do check the hours. When we finally decided we were hungry it had closed. Some great gift shops as well."
34,Something for everyone,The Smithsonian Museums were wonderful to visit. So many things to see and learn about. I only wish we had an entire week to explore this museum. Be aware that mostly everything in DC shuts down at 5pm so get an early start.
35,Multiple topics,Great museum with rare and interesting exhibits.Highly recommend if your visiting DC for the first time.
36,"""Awesome experience at the Smithsonian""",Our family - including two young adults- thoroughly enjoyed wandering through the large museum! There is something for everyone - from the prehistoric era to gemstones to special exhibits. Take the time to read about the displays to broaden your knowledge base.
37,Excellent Guided Tour of Deep Time,"I have been to quite a few Natural History Museums, and this one was pretty good. The various wings were well organized and engaging, with lots of signage.  Not the most outstanding of its type, overall.   However, the geology section was mind boggling.  I went back twice, just to spend more time in that wing of the museum."
38,Love the Dinos !!,"The museum displays several exhibits that one would expect from a museum of natural history - and we did not see all of it. There was a lot to see and to read. What, however, puzzled me was the department of ""African Voices"": Although I did find this exhibition quite interesting and informative, I still cannot come up with an appropriate answer as to why African culture should be displayed in a museum of natural history out of all places."
39,Time Bandit (another National Mall hours stealer).,"This is one of the greatest Museums I have ever visited. You need a whole half day to see it all, but it is worth. Free entrance, marvelous settings, very complete, very nice spaces and good information for visitors!"
40,Wealth of Information!,"Exhibits are interesting, numerous, and free! Learned a lot today by attending the museum. Great time to go, as much quieter in January."
41,Fantastic ,"This museum is great for all ages... Today, we enjoyed seeing the Ocean exhibit, the Mammals exhibits and the Gems. This museum is very informative and tastefully done. Lots of displays which really allows you to absorb the information. The ocean exhibit is wonderful and we never get tired of seeing The Hope Diamond and all the gems & minerals. Great museum for young & old. Enjoy!"
42,Museum of Natural history,"The dinosaurs are just amazing .. so well put together as an exhibit, and a real eye opener to the museum. you can loose yourself for hours in here. a must do as a child or an adult."
43,Great Exhibits,"We think this museum has so much to offer families of all ages.  We had senior citizens down to age four.  We all found things that were of interest to us.  What a plus that there is no fee to enter.  There were 12 in our group, which would have been quite costly!"
44,Thanksgiving in DC,"You could spend days in the place but would die of exhaustion.  One of the more popular Smithsonian museums, it gets crowded but is so large that you have room to enjoy.  There is so much here, covering so many topics.  The exhibits are top notch.  A must visit stop for DC."
45,President's Weekend,"A good museum, if have never been to other Natural History Museums.  Best attraction is the Hope Diamond.  Enjoyed Ocean Hall and Deep Time sections.  Mummy/Egypt display very limited. Sort of confusing to find your way around to the different wings.  In our opinion, the Field Museum in Chicago offers much more & if you want to see fossils and Dinosaur skeletons, the Museum at Black Hills Institute in Hill City, SD is fantastic.  But, in all fairness - to be a 'free' museum, it is well worth your time & you could easily spend all day there."
46,Shine bright like diamond ,"If you are a history buff, then this is the place to go.  This building is so beautifully built and it holds so many interesting artifacts it would be unthinkable to come to Washington, DC and not partake of this venture.  Plan to spend several hours here, due to the immense display available for your pleasure."
47,very busy for a good reason,Fabulous museum!  So much to see. Allow a couple hours to see everything.   There's something for everyone in here!
48,Exceptional Exhibits,"This was the best museum we visited on our trip. This place is HUGE and there are so many exhibits to look at. Interactive, eye opening and educational and who doesn't like a giant elephant welcoming you as soon as you walk through the door. I can't wait to go back!"
49,busy but worth the visit,"Smithsonian of Natural History in Washington DC is a must stop and it's free. It's very close to all the monuments, memorials, and White House. Park on the Southside of the White House and walk from there."
50,Looking for Gems!,"I like this museum and have been before.  But I feel like there was nothing new or exceptional since I visited many many years ago.  But then again, our natural history hasn't changed since then either.  At least do this museum once during a visit.  If you've been before, find something new to see."
51,Awesome!,This place is huge and has such a range of amazing exhibits and displays that a full day can easily be devoted to it. Make sure to not get dragged down reading every description but really take the time to enjoy what catches your eye.
52,Wonderful place,"This is a huge facility with an emphasis on fossils; in fact, there were large displays on both floors dedicated to the prehistoric times. You'll see dinosaurs and mammals of days gone by. The time lines were interesting presentations. Yep, saw the Hope diamond. It was very busy on the Saturday we went so I would suggest going on a week day if at all possible."
53,All museum are free!,We only had a day in Washington DC and didn't have enough time for Smithsonian museums. The exhibits are interesting and worth to spend 2 days here
54,Best place for kids,this is a top notch museum. it is crowded so be ready to deal with people but the exhibits and information they have are intriguing and simple. its very easy to keep a good pace and take in a lot of awesome information. my wife and i fell in love with this museum and had a great time. definitely recommend for everyone.
55,One of the best museum for children in DC,"I’m sure the museum is wonderful and full of learnings, but unfortunately we weren’t able to enjoy it because of the massive crowds.  At some point they should be cutting off entrance- as it completely ruins the experience and ability to read/learn.  Such a disappointment on this trip. And tip- avoid the lines of food trucks outside.  Everyone in our group thought the food from multiple trucks was disgusting and cheap."
56,Exhaustive history of world,"The Museum of Natural History is for sure my favorite out of all of the museums on the National Mall. Its exhibits provide a wide variety of topics, so you're sure to find something of interest for everyone! Plus, it's free. Highly recommend going on a weekday (Monday through Thursday) as it gets extremely busy towards the weekend. Also, be sure to speak to volunteers that you see hanging out in the exhibits like the Ocean Hall, because they are always extremely knowledgable and happy to answer any questions you may have. Great place to spend hours on your own or with the family! A couple things to keep in mind when visiting: all people and bags go through security on the way in, you're not supposed to bring outside food in, and there is a cool new cafe (I think it was megalodon themed, can't recall?) where they offer a variety of foods, ice cream, and coffee."
57,A Washington favorite,"This museum is everything you could wish.  There are animals, gems and more. The dinosaur exhibits are fantastic as are all the different gems and minerals. I would have given this a 5 star but the price of the food once again was very expensive.Tip- use the entrance on Constitution Ave as it is less busy than the front entrance."
58,Best museum!,"I love museums. Husband and I decided we had to see this and its completely worth it! Admission is free and there's a wealth of information contained in those walls. From the Hope diamond, to dinosaurs, sea life, outer space...there's something for the whole family. I highly recommend. We had limited time, but you could spend the better part of a day here at least."
59,Romantic and Peaceful ,"We visited the Castle and the Museum of African Art.  They are close together.   The first was a great way to get an overview of American history and the Smithsonian.  The building itself is a great architectural masterpiece.  The second looks like a small exhibit, but there are four floors of displays, three of them underground.  Very interesting and enlightening museums."
60,Renovations are fantastic!,"We spent a very hot day enjoying the collections and the air con. There are a variety of displays that should satisfy everyone. Children are certainly covered. My favourite was the gem stones. The only problem for us was the cafe service, which was appalling."
61,Great day!,"Amazing museum that is one of the Smithsonian's main museums on the Mall.  Many exhibits detailing history of the natural world including early humans.  Especially enjoyed the Hall of Fossils, Hall of Human Origins, Ocean Hall, and Gemstones as highlights.  Many exhibits are children friendly and would be entertaining to kids. This museum is one of the most popular, so allow plenty of time and be prepared for crowds in peak season (Spring/Summer)."
62,History,"If you go anywhere in Washington, you must go to the Smithsonian Natural History museum. Unbelievable how many items on display, so you simply have to pick your favourites. We loved the rocks and minerals to precious gems collection the most."
63,Must see,"The revamped and updated museum is beautiful done.  Our 11 year old grandson was totally immersed in the exhibits and we spent over 3 hours one day and ended up going back for another 3 hours the following day.  He loved all of the different areas and the Qrious which is a teaching area was a favorite but the Butterfly Conservatory was a hit, too.  This is a don't miss choice."
64,African American museum,Lots of walking but time spent seeing and learning hundreds of interesting facts...a must see when in Washington!
65,Lots to see here,"It’s crazy to me that there are so many activities with free entrance. The Museum of Natural History has a variety of exhibits including dinosaur skeletons, taxidermied animals, a live butterflies, and ocean life among other things. Also there are several nicely stocked gift shops for souvenirs as well."
66,Amazing!,Unbelievable place.  A must see for anyone visiting New York.  Fantastic exhibits.  Spend the whole day there t ok take it in or two if you can.  Well worth it!
67,Worth a trip,"I thought the museum was excellent, well laid out and very informative.Enjoyed the Dinosaur and gem section, some fantastic displays with easy to,follow narrative."
68,Great for kids,"One of the most popular museums in the Smithsonian umbrella, there is a good reason. From grade-schoolers to old folks, this facility is truly fascinating. Look, one really needs to block off several hours at least for this in depth visit.  There's just a LOT to see and learn. I really can't say enough about the quality of this Museum. Stand in line but go in there."
69,My fav !,A wonderful experience! Our favourite museum is the Natural History Museum and we thought no one could come close...but we were wrong! This is a wonderful museum. The Hope diamond was so accessible as well.
70,Fantastic must see museum,This museum I would say is one of the most popular for tour groups. I would recommend going during a week day if you can manage it. The out of town crowds flood the area on Saturdays and Sunday. Great to take kids. Gift shops are a bit pricey but you can find some real treasures depending upon the season you visit. A great last minute family outing on a weekend if you dont mind crowds. Fall and winter seasons are the best times to visit.
71,Much more for the children,"If you only have time to see one thing here, it must be the Minerals and Gems section! They are from out of this world!"
72,Well worth it ,"Wonderful museum with amazing specimens, artifacts & collections. Hope Diamond is the ultimate thing to see there on level 2. The entry is free and make sure you have 3 to 4 hours time to enjoy all floors and collections."
73,Great Museum!! ,Amazing exhibits and helpful staff! This museum is huge so make sure you give yourself enough time to see all of the exhibits.
74,Must See Museum,World’s premium example of Natural History based collection... one day for sure at this fantastic museological experience
75,Wow,I think I could spend a whole day here. Very interesting exhibits. There were big crowds on our visit but we got to see everything we want to.The cafe is nice. The food on the second floor looked better. The food is not cheap.
76,Go back to science and history in this amazing museum,"This place is vast, so much to see and do. Highly recommend for people of all ages. You need many hours to make your way around this site. It takes about 2 hours just to walk around, if you want to stop and read and take a look at everything there, you'll easily require a full day."
77,Walking into History Class again,Lots of good and informative displays that you must come and see. I thoroughly enjoyed the gems displays and got to see the Hope Diamond...can’t bet that for a free museum.
78,Free and Fun,This is a very good museum of you are into the natural development of science. Very informative and a very beautiful building.
79,Family trip,It's free and loaded with exhibits. You can spend all day going between all the Smithsonian's and have a great educational experience
80,Hidden History Tours: Dallas Ft Worth African American Treasures.,We enjoyed the time spent here and the quality of the exhibits. There is just not enough time in the day to see everything in each building. It is a must see and try to maximize your time with the things you are passionate about.
81,More than expected,"It's been many years since I last visited this museum and it's still a great place.  Noticeably more modern than the last time I was here, but also found the old stand by exhibits, now displayed differently."
82,Even Little Kids Will Like This!,This museum is fantastic for kids. Lots to see both alive and dead. The kids got to hold bugs as well as seeing the dinosaur bones. The six year old loved seeing the Hope diamond and other shiny and interesting stones. There are stores dotted all over to entice you to spend. There were lots of people there on a cold winter Sunday.
83,Natural History Museum,"From dinosaurs to present day birds, this museum has it all. They have elevators if you don't want to walk up and down stairs. There are basically two levels of things to see, and both have amazing artifacts."
84,Need a week and then some,"This is a place everyone in the family would enjoy, it gets busy but the displays are worth it. I can't even replicate how it feels to see the dinosaur skeletons in all their glory. Really a can't miss if you're in DC with family."
85,Great Displays,"I just couldn't believe that all the Smithsonian Museum are free! I love the exhibit, people were so friendly and I loved the time spend there. The Dinosaur exhibit is very well done and interactive. Kids of all ages would love it.❤"
86,You could spend days in here,"We were thinking that there isn't much to see in this museum and only visited it late in the afternoon, however, there are so many great things to see and we have to forgo some as we need to leave the museum as it is closing. Will come back to visit next time."
87,Very good ,"Not only do you get a look at the most magnificent gems in the world, but also the history from prehistorical times.  There was a dinosaur exhibit showing what they looked like in skeleton form. There is so much to see from mummies to sea life to animals in realistic poses.  The halls are arranged around a central area where you are greeted by a giant elephant.  Once you enter a particular hall there is so  much to see that you will need at least 4-5 hours for this museum."
88,Free admission to this popular museum in Washington DC,"Where to start? I had no idea how huge this place is. The exhibits are beautifully done, the attention to detail faultless. Free tour guides who have an amazing insight and knowledge of America’s history and explain it in an entertaining way. One day is not enough, you would need two or three to really digest it all. And amazingly it’s all free."
89,Natural History... Worldwide Preview ,"This is a huge museum and you could easily spend several days here. We went twice and spent a total of around 9 hours and didn't see everything. The exhibits are good but seem dated. I felt like I had to work harder to learn here than at other museums. I didn't really feel this museum works well for folks that like to casually walk through and learn somethings, or the read nearly everything type (which I am). Don't get me wrong, there is more than plenty to see and it's worth a visit. Maybe I was just expecting more from the Smithsonian, I'm not sure."
90,WONDERFUL PLACE FOR YOUR KIDS OF ANY AGE,"There are many exhibits that are noteworthy in this museum, but the dinosaur exhibit (Fossil Hall) is by far the most impressive.  The work that has gone into the recreation of the habitat and fossils is great!"
91,Nice upgrades in the Fossil Hall,"Great to see the updated exhibits..beautifully done and worth the visit, we were in awe of the chsnges made to the "" dinosaurs "" by creating a complete environment versus the previous exhibit of individual dinosaurs not in any environment or relationship to the rest of the flora and fauna."
92,Loved the gems and butterflies!,Thoroughly enjoyable experience visiting the museum with my partner. You can easily spend a few hours in here without realising the time go by. So many interesting artefacts to see. Unbelievable that it is free entry.
93,A can’t go wrong experience in DC!,"Such a great natural history museum ! The only problem- it is so big that you may not be able to take in everything. Also, it was very crowded when we went, so there was a line to go through most galleries. Even a long line to enter....but I was glad to see people interested in museums enough to wait in line :)  As with all Smithsonians, be prepared to have bags checked - no outside food but bottled water was permitted.It was raining the day we last went and the museum provided umbrella bags:)"
94,plan more time to explore,"There's something for everyone here, from dinosaurs to stunning gems.  The building is also impressive."
95,Lots of great things to see ,"I spent 3 hrs in here. There's so much to see and experience. There are lots of interactive displays that one can play around with. Loved the cool camera that shows how you could look if you were one of the earlier homo specie. There's ocean, gem, human history, mammal, butterfly section. It's free entrance, has restaurant, rest room and free Wi-Fi."
96,Surprised our teens with such an AWESOME experience!,"The museum has only recently opened the years long revamp of its dinosaur exhibition, so I was looking forward to the new Tyrannosaurus rex exhibit.  I had not been to the Natural History Museum in years, and the new dinosaur exhibit did not disappoint.  I had read about the woman in Montana who had discovered the t-rex’s bones on her ranch in 1998.  I can’t recall who she contacted, but the bones were excavated to reveal the only complete t-rex skeleton.  It is truly amazing that these huge animals roamed the earth some 67 million years ago....I swear that its head was as large as my five foot tall body.  The whole skeleton was some 40 feet long.  Of course, there are other cool fossils in the room, so look around and try to imagine what the earth was like then.  We left the dinosaur exhibit, and watched some great and informative videos, like the one about reintroducing oysters to New York harbor.  We also saw the Hope Diamond, which is like 43 karats.  You can spend hours at the museum wandering from room to room.....as long as you can before suffering from museum burnout."
97,Love this museum!,Fascinating exhibits showing unusual and fabulously gorgeous natural wonders from iridescent rocks  to the crafted magnificent Hope Diamond .
98,So much to see,"The Museum provides a lot of  useful information about historic sites. Beside, this is a good place for photography and researching."
99,Mixed Review,Spent a couple of hours here and again learned things I did not know. Lots of displays regarding fossils of dinosaurs along with many other animals. Discovered the many similarities between mammals skeletons. Very educated and kids love it all.
100,Dinosaurs.  Who doesn't like dinosaurs?,"The museum is well organized, eclectic and has so much to offer.  Leave at least 3 hours to go through.  Well worth the visit."
101,A centre of excellence!,"Great museum to stop by whilst walking down the National Mall. Free admission, great information. Lots of fossils and specimens."
102,Good experience,I’ve been to a natural history museum before but this one impressed me because they had large exhibitions. You can even see the scientists working live on fossils through a glass pane. Best thing so it’s free and unlike other natural museums it’s been kept up to date and maintained well
103,World Class Minerals Display,I have always wanted to visit the museum. I focused on the mammal and bird exhibits. Did not disappoint.
104,Great place to learn history and culture.,"Over time this museum has lots its luster.  The Hope Diamond sparkles still but the dinos, mummies, whales, and more are all in need of an upgrade.  Although the collection is broad in scope, there is little depth.  OK for a part day visit, but hard to interest a family to stay longer.  The Dino exhibit has potential but needs more interactive items and perhaps some reconstructions of new theories about feathered friends (there is only one fossil in a corner showing Dino feathers).  The hope diamond glitters but beyond it the minerals need some interactivity to make them more enticing.  The Orkin bugs exhibit was pretty good.  The butterfly cage is small compared to many others around the world.  Overall OK but for our national museum we should do better."
105,Incredible,Give yourself plenty of time at this museum. My college age daughter was fascinated! We spent 3 hours looking at the exhibits and could have stayed even longer. I thought the pathways were tight upstairs for those with strollers.
106,Great exhibits!,This is the Smithsonian everyone said I should visit and it didn’t disappoint but there is far too much to get through in just a single visit.  After 4 hours I was museum’ed out and yet still had a lot to see.  The museum was also quite crowded so not going in holiday time would also be better.  Something for everyone here and its a good idea to identify what you really want to see and just stick to that rather than trying to cram in everything.
107,Deep Time,"This museum gives a life size view of fossils, current animals and how humans came to exist. It was a great museum just got to it later in our day."
108,Adventures and learnings for all ages,"Always a fun adventure coming to this museum - the mammals, the fossils, the bones, the insects, the gems and minerals, the special exhibit (this time was Outbreak! (viruses and epidemics)). Start with what interests you most, meander through, see everything there is - then explore areas you may not be as interested in - because no matter what it will be fascinating! I always learn and see something new."
109,DC Trip,"It is my fourth visit and I found it as exciting as my first. My favorite is the Gems and Mineral exhibit. The precious stones are simply stunning including huge emeralds, rubies and both the Kimberly and Hope diamond. The Ocean exhibit is equally interesting including the giant sea monsters of the past and current deep sea creatures."
110,"Refurbished, hue fascinating",Took my children years ago to the museum to see the dinosaur wing. The new wing is 1000 percent better. All ages will enjoy the exhibit. A must do when in DC!
111,Renovated Fossil Hall is fabulous,I work nearby and this is my go to relaxation place.  Visited the new Dino Hall exhibit and was kind of disappointed.  Even though the Dino exhibits are much better I prefer the old Dino Hall.  The old hall was very clear that you entered and moved along the exhibit by the geological timeline.  The new exhibit focuses mainly on fossils and it does not seem to follow a timeline.
112,Amazing displays of natural beauty,Had not been to this museum in many years and was pleasantly surprised with the new look. We especially enjoyed the interactive exhibit encompassing human evolution. This exhibit alone was a great and quick lesson in our human evolution.
113,Dinosaurs are even better!,"After visiting the museum over the years, but I can see why the museum is so much more crowded.  Upgrades to the Fossil Hall makes it more modern and interactive.  Good displays in active poses instead of just gathering dust."
114,History Buff,Allow yourself at least 3 hours in each museum!!! There's so much to see in each on and in order to enjoy it give yourself time so you're not rushed!!! This is one of my fave Smithsonian's!!! Such a wide variety!! The mummy was cool and the wing about all the natural stones and gems was beautiful!!  Also the squid is huge!!!
115,Even a Hard to Please 3 Year Old Liked It,I was a little disappointed in all of the Smithsonian museums. This one is the best of the ones I saw. I liked the dinosaurs exhibits some of the best fossils I've seen. It is a hard museum to navigate as thru so make sure you have aa map. There is no clear path to follow.          It's not a bad museum I just expected more from the DC Smithsonian.
116,Amazing sights to see,It's a great place for the young and old. Very educational. You can spend an hour or the whole day... it doesn't matter because its FREE!!!There was no line when we got here.
117,DC Trip,This museum was great but very much like what we had seen at the Natural History Museum in Chicago. The greatest difference was that this DC museum is FREE.
118,Never get tired of it,This is a fun museum to visit with your kids. So many interesting sections to explore. Great museum to have a treasure hunt...
119,We couldn't tear our grandson away,Was very fortunate to have the opportunity to visit the newly opened Deep Time exhibit before hours for a special tour.  This is very impressive and well done.  Also walked through the outbreak exhibit and saw the Hope Diamond.  This is great place for families to visit.  Not to be missed on your visit to DC.
120,Good muesum,"A good variety of exhibits, we enjoyed exploring the museum even though it was quite busy - there was generally enough to keep people spread about."
121,Precious stones and gems exhibits,Went there in 2016.  A cute place to learn the history and the wildlife.  We went to the mammuals area and it was nice.  The Museum is nice and secure in case any bad guys tries to sneak in.  Anyway it is a great museum
122,Amazing ,My teens weren't in love with the entire museum experience until they stepped foot inside! Fossils and gemstones had them fascinated. Mummies have also been my favorite and I was happy to see it was just as awesome as I remember when I was 10!
123,Lost its luster,"In a city with so many things to do, we wish we had skipped this museum.  If you've been to see other museums of Natural History, there is not a lot different here.  Same type of exhibits about evolution, marine life, gemology/geography as in many other places.  Plus, it was soooo crowded.  Much more crowded than any other Smithsonian Museum we went to.  Not worth squeezing through crowds to see the Hope Diamond!"
124,American history and culture on display,"Great museum full of wonderful exhibits on dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures, gems and minerals, early Human artifacts and ancestry, animals and insects (including taxidermy specimens and fossils), mummies, and more! Best of all, entrance is FREE!  I particularly like the gem and mineral collection. So amazing and beautiful."
125,Refreshed by Renovation ,"A museum not to be missed.   Every genre of natural world.  Fossils, deep sea, mammals. Gems, minerals, the list is too long to list it all.  Honestly a day is not enough to see it all unless you skip much. If you are interested in any of the sciences this is a place to make sure to see."
126,One of the best Natuaral History Museums on the planet,Way better museum than i expected. Not the usual bland boring displays but it has been extremely well presented. I can’t say one section was better than another but the fossil section wasn’t just a collection of old bones but a truly informative exhibit.So much to see it would need a full day just in this one museum.
127,Excellent Natural History Museaum,"The newest galleries of the NMNH seem to recall the presentation methods and style of the mid-20th century and not is a good way. Brightly lit rooms full of stuff in boxes, and plenty of descriptive copy."
128,What a national treasure,This is by far the best museum I have been to. Unfortunately we were on a limited time scheduale and didnt get to spend as much time here as I would have liked. Could have easily spent 2 full days here. Its wonderful that this is a free museum. Would certainly recommend for kids and adults alike!
129,Disappointing,One of our favourite museums. This was the most crowded and one of the most interesting. You'll need several sit downs to rest and process what you've seen. Lots of photo ops.
130,Off the bucket list - but not the return list,"The museum flows from one room to another, Many different exhibits - fossils, mammals, gems, sea life. All are presented in their natural form."
131,Must see in DC!,"Been here a couple of times...always come back for more. Extensive displays, well laid out, great use of space. The gemscare amazing!"
132,Very interesting facts and collections,"What an amazing museum this is and so much to see and do, free admission opens at 10am, the gems and diamonds they have in one section are breathtaking, the collection of artefacts are incredible, a real must go to place whilst you are in DC"
133,A Most Impressive Museum,"Beautiful museum. A lot of space to enjoy incredible amount of examples of the natural world : fossils, animals, minerals. A place not to be missed."
134,"Casts, casts and more casts","Free, always a little edgy, always interesting, informative and entertaining. Love Washington and the Smithsonian is the icing on the cake. Fun and entertaining for everyone."
135,So much to see!!!,"It’s literally a two story building full of different subjects like gems, mummy’s, dinosaurs, butterflies, insects, and Ocean History.There’s several shop to buy trinkets , touch and pull objects for kids and mutiple clean restrooms lol. It was free entry when I went but it’s great for all family and friend types !"
136,Very cool museum,I could have spent hours here - so much to see. I enjoyed the Egyptian section and seeing the Hope Diamond. A great place to learn stuff.
137,Very well built. Easy to tour,"We had a great time, there is so much to see. I'm still amazed the museum is free. We spend a couple of hours here, could have spend more time here, still a lot to see. The museum is huge, and its easy to get around. It would be a great place for young teenagers."
138,I spent most of my time looking at the Jewels!,"If you ever visit Washington DC, you have to go there. It's real inspiration and full of real meaningful items."
139,AWESOME! ! Museum a Must SEE! !8/.02,"In my opinion what made this museum was the insect exhibit. This is the only museum that I have ever been to that has live insects. I actually held a cockroach!!! Very cool, make time for this place!"
140,Superb ,This place is probably geared more towards children...but it’s something adults can enjoy as well. And it’s free! They have some pretty neat exhibits and we spent a few hours walking through the entire place.
141,So much to see - so little time!,"I was locking forward to going back to this museum, 15 years ago it was amazing and my favorite stop in DC.  All of the cool informational exhibits have been replaced with evolution propaganda. Stories of wolly mammoths instantly frozen with food still in their mouth have been replaced with planet of the apes movies ."
142,America's Treasures,I really loved this museum. A lot of visuals. Many informative videos to watch as well. It felt like the Smithsonian books that I read in real life. Would come again.
143,Still a great place,This is my second visit to this museum and The Hope Diamond was on the top of our list of must-see things to see in dc. The remainder of the geology exhibit was also the excellent.
144,"Great Ocean Hall and fabulous new Fossil Hall, live butterflies, gems and much more!","This museum is fantastic. It's packed with varied exhibits and it’s a great way to spend the day. They have it all from insects to dinosaurs, and everything in between. It’s all well maintained and well-curated. This museum is free but can get crowded with queues to enter."
145,Amazing,"For a great hands on adventure, explore this museum!  It is the perfect wAy g Th I enjoy nautical history as you travel through time, explore science, gems, animals and more.  I do recommend visiting here when you are in DC."
146,What a hoot!,"This is a great place to visit but there is so much to see and if has been updated so lots of new things to see .... awesome.  We took our grandson and his wife here shortly before Christmas 2019. Lines were not excessive and crowds were tolerable.If you get the chance, this is well worth the time and effort especially if you have school-aged children.That said, if you can spread it out, suggest you do so -- my wife and i are senior citizens and we got tired pretty quickly (2 hours) as the exhibits are quite extensive.  Would not have missed it for anything though. :-)"
147,Interesting and well laid out museum - better than NY,The breadth of the collection as well as the manner in which they are displayed is simply mind boggling. You can spend the entire day in this building. Brilliant
148,Surprising Smithsonian,"I was expecting many fossils and exhibits, but felt underwhelmed by offerings at museum. Was glad to have finally experienced, just wanted more natural history"
149,Always a great museum to visit,This is still an amazing place to take kids of all ages. My middle schooler was thrilled with the work going on in the fossil lab.
150,A great new look with some interactive exhibits.,"The Natural HIstory Museum's bright new Fossil Hall is an amazing place to see.  It is a bright space and effective fusion of science and education.  It is science communication at its best.  The hall makes very effective use of dioramas, visual technology and fossil displays in natural poses.  It is nicely designed by period and separated by different habitats.  The hall very effectively illustrates major evolutionary challenges in emerging from the water, returning to the water or in flying.  Similarly, the Ocean Hall's exhibits illustrate how we know of certain events in the earth's history, how climate is reconstructed and the impact of changing climate over time or other disruptive events, including asteroids.  The museum is large and even a day will not allow someone to cover it fully.  Take it in bits and see gems and live butterflies one day and the Fossil and Ocean Halls another.  Spectacular!!!"
151,Has something for everyone,"We visited the Natural History Museum and I fell in love with it! I love fossils, animals, biology and knowledge of Earth's transformations. It's a visit full of interesting information where you can see everything you learned at school, live and in color! I just loved it, and it's free! Unbelievable! I would like to return some day"
152,Amazing!,Everyone needs to go. It’s free and fabulously educational.  The butterfly exhibit is magical.Global warming is a definite message.  All of the ocean life history will charm kids and adults.
153,Interesting but Tired,This is one of the best museums to see.  Get there early to beat the crowds and lunch is a must-do for the entire group.
154,Wonderful museum,"As other reviewers have said, this museum is excellent for kids. But as an adult, I loved it too. There is an insect zoo with live insects. When I was there, they had ""insect ambassadors"" out with a few insects out for visitors to see up close. In this same area, there is a small butterfly enclosure with plants. I visited on a Tuesday and it was closed! However, you can see inside, so I was able to at least get a nice look at it. My FAVORITE part is the gem area. The Hope diamond is on display, and in the room adjacent, are many historical gems that have been donated to the museum (or as they put it, to the American people)."
155,A Great Place to Explore,"It's a nice museum, also special for kids because it's full of activities, but also adults can enjoy and discover again the nature through this excellent museum."
156,Family Vacation,"This is on par with the museum of Natural History, due to different but similar reasons. You just can't get this density of education and different (admittedly shallow) exposures to the sciences anywhere else. It's great!"
157,Great place to visit,This Museum is a must do if you are in DC. I would of loved to have spent more time in the Harry Winston area just staring at the jewelry. It was a treat to see The Hope Diamond in person.
158,Excellent!,You can spent a day if not days here. So many thing to see and to learn about. Its almost too overwhelming...
159,"Great, family-friendly fun!","We loved our visit here. All the sections are well laid out and presented. The highlight for me was the transportation section, for my wife it was the quilt exhibit. The staff at the information desk were very helpful."
160,"Free admission, lots to see ",This is an awesome display exhibits through time You could spend all day or even several days just in this museum Very sad that we have to go through TSA type screeningThe great part of the Smithsonian’s are that they are still FREE
161,"Mass appeal, Beautiful environment,  Lovely volunteers","I hadn’t been here in over 15 years and they have done an excellent job brightening up all areas of the museum with colorful signage, huge banners, and updated exhibits. We went to the deep ocean, dinosaur walk back in time, the gems -yes the hope diamond too! The butterfly exhibit seemed good in theory but is really fairly small (for the love ones) and I didn’t feel like looking at the insects so can’t comment there. They had an outstanding photo exhibition - that will be closed but they rotate lots through there. Absolutely worth going to see"
162,T-Rex Steals the Show,"Coming from living in NYC area we were used to the wonderful natural history museum there.  This museum was as good if not better and felt a bit more modern.There were many things to see and an impressive experience across mammals, the ocean, dinosaurs, mummies and gems.  I highly recommend."
163,Spent 5 hours here and still didn't see everything,"Well thought out layout.Interesting information.Beautiful and clean.What really impressed me was the attention to details - everytime a question came to mind, the answer was on the next board !"
164,An interesting range of displays,"We enjoyed the entire museum, but the early man exhibit was especially interesting. Something for everyone in our group. The food offered was not good and overpriced-we sould have stopped at the food trucks outside. Love food trucks!"
165,Fun for kids,"If visiting DC, this is another must see museum. The world's most popular natural history museum is dedicated to understanding the natural world and our place in it."
166,Nice to visit on rainy days. ,You could spend the whole day there!  There is so much to see!  I enjoyed seeing the gems and minerals the most.  The animals skeletons were also very interesting!  The museum can be overwhelming & exhausting if you do not wear comfortable footwear.
167,Amazing,I am a little kid when it comes to dinosaurs. I had to see the Museum's display. Loved it! I was even more impressed with the geology minerals and gems display. I thought I would just see the Deep Time display. I saw much more. I went back two days later and must return again!
168,Presidential History,There were some interesting exhibits but I left feeling disappointed. Maybe it’s because I enjoyed the New York museum so much more - there seemed to be a lot less here. The dinosaur section was small although it was interesting to see people actually working on fossils. The mineral section was an unexpected highlight but the butterfly area was sadly closed. The bones were also interesting. It felt like they had sacrificed exhibits for the sake of being interactive - probably better if you have children.
169,Awesome Free Museum,I thoroughly enjoyed the new exhibit on epidemics. The sheer number of artifacts and displays was impressive. Definitely not as enjoyable as when I saw it as a child but still a very good afternoon as an adult.
170,Great experience ,"A free admission museum with extensive dinosaur, sea creature and mammal exhibits. They also have Gemstones, the Hope diamond and Mummies among another things. A pay for admission Butterfly pavilion is also available to enjoy live butterflies. Worth a visit!"
171,Wish we had more time ,It was an excellent museum. Wish we had more time to spend exploring. At at the cafe (good food but expensive at $100 for 6 of us).
172,Spend hours there & it's not enough!,"We started the day at the White House Visitor Center, a no no for a child.  Here there are lots of things to see and do -- Jacob held a grasshopper and worm and was fascinated.  The African animal exhibit and the dinosaur area are real keepers.  Even the skeleton area was great.  Also a good cafeteria.  Don't expect to see it all in one visit, just pick the areas you want to see.  We stayed away from the live butterfly hall, since we had never seen any of this museum.  Well worth 3 hours of your time."
173,Amazing museum,This was our first trip to DC with our 2 daughters (10 & 7).  This place was amazing. Could have stayed here all day but WAY TOO MUCH TO SEE!!
174,Wonderful! Recommend the transportation section.,There are such an amazing amount of treasures to see! Wear comfortable shoes and plan to stay awhile.
175,Amazing ,This is a museum that goes against all Christian conservative values. It is all about the evolution of man from ape. If you believe in God and the Bible do not bother with this museum. You will be disappointed.
176,Best Museum!,"I am so glad I got the opportunity to explore this museum with my daughter for my first trip back to DC in 23 years! The exhibits are still as awe-inspiring as they were then, and I could and did spend all day taking in the sights. My favorite area is still the amazing displays of minerals and gems, and I once again got to see the Hope Diamond. My daughter loved the prehistoric display, but we were both disappointed we missed the special display on narwhals. We will have to plan another visit soon!!"
177,Recent visit,This no entry fee old museum is worth a visit especially with young children to see the dinosaurs etc  We limited ourselves to gemstones and this was worth it  The Hope Diamond Wow!!Personally I love a more interactive exhibit with high tech explanations but this exhibit certainly has a wow factor. Two pieces of jewellery given by Napoleon to Empress Marie Louise and Marie Antoinettes earrings. Don’t miss them!!
178,Simply Incredible,"We spent 5 hours here and still didn't see everything!It's a beautiful building, free entry with well presented displays some of which are interactive. We went through the ages with the dinosaur and fossil displays, watched the scientists at work exposing more fossils, took part in the fight against viruses, ogled the gem stones and a lots more experiences. We were lucky enough to be there for live butterfly experience in a pop up hot house - beautiful!"
179,Not a very science-y person,The museum seemed somewhat disjointed and appeared to display animals for the sake of it. There was not really a great deal of cohesion between the exhibits or a narrative which clearly detailed the point of the place. Also disappointing is the fact that most if not all of the exhibits are just casts so everything you are seeing is just a model. I didn't want to visit Madame Tussauds for animals...The photo booth which makes you a caveman is laughably bad.. but probably laughably bad in that kind of good way but you decide.
180,Impressive ,"This was the museum that I thought I could spend all day enjoying.  I think my husband enjoyed it but me not so much.  The entry into the rotunda was beautiful but much smaller than I expected it to be.  I went with the intention of seeing the Hope Diamond and the butterfly garden. The butterflies were pretty but the garden was so small. After trying to get around the crowded museum I gave up and found a seat to wait on my husband.  I honestly couldn't handle all the children whinning and crying. How does a parent expect young children to enjoy this museum? It's not designed for babies/toddlers. Serioulsy, as I sat and observed families with little ones the parents were miserable because the little ones were. The only museum we visited where children seemed engaged and well behaved was the American History Museum."
181,Wonderful and prideful,"All day place to go and Free. Has many exhibitions that have multiple visual, audio and manipulative ways of experiencing."
182,"Busiest place in DC, not for leisurely vacationers","I can spend all day at this museum.  Whatever you do don't hurry through, stroll, read, learn this is a great space."
183,Very informative,"We didn't see all of the museum as there is so much to see.  There is quite a lot of interactive items so great fun for kids, its clearly explained and well displayed."
184,Interesting for families,"Still Fun After All of These Years!What a great day. Plan to spend your time enjoying multiple exhibits ranging from mammals to the sea world. Beautiful displays with interactive exhibits for extra fun. Lots of food, drinks and rest for the weary as well."
185,Fun time,I tend to go to museums everywhere I go and I love the Natural History ones. This was a bit smaller than I thought it would be but had plenty things to see and learn about. We didn't have time to explore it all but what we saw we liked. There was a live butterfly exhibit which we loved even though I'm not a big fan of insects. Very entertaining and interesting to see and learn about them. Staff were nice and knowledgeable. Would have loved to spend a bit more time there. So if you are kken you need at least 3-4 hours to get a good grasp of what's on display. Free entry so no excuse to miss it.
186,More museum weekend,"I might be old but I am not excited to see museums any more, although this one was good if you can navigate the crowds (go at the opening bell) and take in some of the exhibits like the gem collections and some of the CDC info was eye opening."
187,live butterflies on yr head!,"The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History is fascinating.  Interested in the age of dinosaurs and creatures that walked the earth long ago? How about the extinction event and  the rise of mammals? learn how the geology and climate of the earth has changed over geologic time, the Ice ages, then gems, rocks and minerals. Truly, this museum has it all.  You can breeze through main galleries for a brief visit, or explore one room after another, to explore more in depth the various aspects of our planet. Exhibits do change over time, so if you haven't been in awhile, consider a visit to see what's new."
188,Best museum! ,We had researched this particular Smithsonian in order to see the Hope diamond. Well that was fantastic but there was so much more! The whole family enjoyed learning the history of that diamond and all of the other gemstones and rock formations housed at the museum.I loved the butterfly exhibit and being able to have the different types of butterflies all around me. I didn’t count on it being so hot and humid so I wasn’t able to stay as long as I would have liked but it was still amazing.We really enjoyed the narwhal exhibition and the rotunda and other areas were fabulous too. We will definitely return!
189,So much to see,"It's a big museum but think 2 hours is enough to spend there. A lot of different exhibits where you can find something for everyone. Great collection of minerals, animals, rocks, insects, fossils and impressive collection of gems. Very popular museum so there are a lot of people inside."
190,Lives up to the hype,This is one of the best museums for young kids as my daughter started to visit the museum when she was two years old as we live in DC. She loves visiting the museum on weekends and we can spend a half day in the museum without issue.
191,A Gem on the Mall,There's so much to see and anyone can easily find something of interest to explore! You'll need a large hunk of time to see it all for sure but it's so worth it. I really enjoyed the section on early humans.
192,So much to see,"Although we were returning to this museum, it always fascinates me to see the past retold to us in the present."
193,Absolute must visit irrespective of your age!,Building more. I once heard people didn't care about history. Millions have gone to the Smithsonian just to see history. I believe it would take a year to see all they offer. I haven't heard. Great site to see.
194,Love natural history ,So much to see - it would be easy to spend an entire day here but we had other museums to visit so were just able to scratch the surface.
195,So many museums to see,"We returned to see the newly reopened Dinosaur exhibit and the whole family loved it! Plenty of facts to read for teens and adults, but plenty of exhibits closer to the ground, at the eye-level of younger visitors! The bright and airy hall has wide pathways, conveniently placed benches and ramps for accessibility for all!  The live butterfly exhibit is another must see. They charge to enter, but check online because it’s free one day per week.The cafe food is pricey, but the food is pretty good quality and they have enough options for everyone to find what they want. Many of the toys in the gift shop are cheaper elsewhere, but many of the kids books are priced the same as elsewhere.If you are visiting DC and have space in your schedule, visit this museum twice because you won’t be able to take it all in on one visit!"
196,Museum of Natural History,"This museum was the one thing I really wanted to see in DC and I was not disappointed. I really loved the bones exhibit with skeletons of all sorts of animals and drove my friend crazy with my prolonged interest and extended time spent reading the signs. The gems and minerals was also really neat and I loved seeing the Hope diamond which I’ve heard about! The birds of DC was really cool to me too, though the bottom level is a little confusing to navigate."
197,Insects,"The natural history museum is good, exhibits and collections pretty interesting but also nothing to write home about, if you like rocks, dinosaurs and stuffed animals you’ll be very happy, if you have been to a natural history museumbefore, it’ll be pretty much the same. We found it a bit haphazard and complicated to navigate although they did have a good cafe and it wasn’t too crowded...one highlight was holding live insects if you are into that sort of thing... my kids liked it!"
198,Favorite museum in DC,This museum is free and they are building ADA ramps to entrance. There may be lines  but it moves really fast. The inside is huge with a lots to see and a lot of information. While inside there are workers wearing a vest that can answer questions and well as videos constantly running that provides information. The Hope Diamond is a sight to behold but so is everything else. It’s very informative and family friendly. I noticed that they even find a way to engage and keep kids attention...something for everyone.
199,Great for kids,"I’m not much of a museum person, but it’s quite impressive. The Gem exhibit is spectacular. The Hope diamond is certainly one of a kind. This exhibit was by far my favorite. The elephant that greets you is impressive. So much to see. Don’t rush...we’ll worth the visit and it’s free admission!"
200,"It was good, but nothing special","This museum is absolutely fantastic.  It's absolutely packed full of different exhibits, so many that it's almost impossible to see everything in a single day.  They have everything from butterflies to dinosaurs, and everything in between.  Everything is well-curated, and there are benches in case you need to take a break from all of the walking (because this museum is huge).  This museum is free, which is even better."
201,Iconic and grand,"Great stuff for kids and adults of all ages! Whether you go for the dinosaurs or the history, everyone can learn and be fascinated by something."
202,"Parker says ""Another great Smithsonian venue.""","We were able to get in to the museum with minimal wait and no advance reservation by arriving shortly by opening. Fascinating exhibits but quite crowded and the crowd control strategies take you to the bottom floor where it is hard to go at a different pace than the crowd. We allotted half a day to the visit and only saw a portion. Probably would take 2-3 full days to see all. The top floor exhibits, focused on culture, were less crowded and very interesting. Cafe/restaurant was very busy and we did not try it. Look forward to a future visit when the crowds have dwindled."
203,Don’t go on a Saturday- crowds ruin experience,We took a guided bus tour and this was one of the stops. There are too many displays to even begin describing them. Everyone needs to take the time to visit.
204,Amazing place don’t miss,"Such a fun adventure! Something for every member of the family young and old!  Everything from insects and butterfly's to rocks, gems and minerals and much more.  You should arrive as soon as it opens to avoid long lines and plan on staying a full day."
205,A lot to see and a lot to learn!,"This museum doesn't disappoint history and science lovers covering everything's from evolution, exploration, anthropology and different models of animals from prehistoric era.The different pavilions are easy for navigation and worth spend halfday in the visinity."
206,Dave O,"Interestingly, this museum a couple of years ago was the eleventh most visited in the world - and I am not surprised.. Not only does it house millions of natural history specimens, it is also the establishment where scientists can continue their invaluable work. Another museum where you needed to get written information to refresh your memory when you had left. Vast in area, you really need to allow a good day there."
207,So much to see!!,"Great place to visit for kids or adults. Prepare for lots of other people, though, certainly not a quiet museum."
208,First time visitor!,"Things not to miss: the giant elephant, the huge coin from Yap near the back entrance, Hope Diamond and other gemstones, meteors, and the butterfly conservatory (at an extra charge)."
209,Must see us the dinosaur wing,"Something for everyone.  Dinosaurs are very cool along with animals birds, ocean creatures.  Gemstones are beautiful including the Hope Diamond, Angelina Jolie’s citrine necklace & earrings worn by Marie Antoinette.  The food here is expensive & just fast food so beware.  Busy museum so go early to be crowds."
210,Many things to see,"Definitely worthwhile. My wife immediately headed toward upstairs for the exhibit on Presidents, President's wives, and their dresses exhibited. The museum opens at 10:00 AM and closes at 5:30 PM. Located just off the National Mall. Near Smithsonian Metro stop.Free entrance 365 days a year. Highly recommend"
211,So Much to See,"My 12 year old really enjoyed the gemstones/minerals exhibit and the skeletons. I was impressed. Exhibits seemed pretty refreshed, unlink the Nat Hist Museum in NY when I last visited. Go in the entrance off the mall - it has shorter lines on a busy day."
212,Closes too early,"I think I would have actually saw the National Air and Space Museum instead.   It's great if you have kids because of the dinosaurs, but otherwise - eh!"
213,Literally A Gem of a Museum,"As always the Smithsonian never disappoints. It is a delight to visito again and again.  The collections are beautiful, interesting and totally worth. A must in the DC area."
214,All Natural,Something for everyone. Three floors of exhibits. Food and gift shop. Fun and learning for all and cross ages. No charge. Line to get in thru security. Clean.
215,Gems Section,Entrance to this museum was quick and easy even though there was only line the staff were friendly and efficient. There was a lot on display and a few exhibits were closed. I’m definitely thinking about a repeat visit.
216,Smithsonian Natural History Museum,Came here to escape the heat. Ended up enjoying our visit. Spent several hours here getting lost and taking in the sights. A must see if in DC.
217,Great way to take your time and visit the various exhibits ,"This is most shocking. They play toward the evolutionist &Millions & millions of years crowd. Those who are a little more discerned with science & study realize that around 6,000 yrs is MUCH closer to the truth. The earth was Not hit by a meteor. It was formed, and all was created in its kind."
218,Best Museum in DC,"I've been to the American Museum of Natural History in New York so i can't say i was excited for what i was seeing in this museum but it was interesting enough to enjoy it. Facilities were clean and staff informative. There's many exhibitions of wildlife, fossils and nature history. Worth to visit while in Washington, DC."
219,Great with kids!,"pretty much something for everyone.  Hope diamond is definitely worth seeing.  Exhibits take you all the way from first life to present day, with lots of details, pictures, etc.  took me about 3 hours to get through.  The butterfly exhibit charges extra $$ I believe."
220,Wonderful Museum,"I went initially just to see the Hope Diamond but walked around for about 3 hours. Loved every bit of it, especially the butterfly atrium. So many interesting artifacts and loved reading the history behind each."
221,Absolutely Required,"We enjoyed this museum but actually were surprised it wasn't larger.  It was awesome to see the Hope Diamond!  My daughter loved the area for kids to explore with microscopes, etc."
222,Dinosaurs!,"Museums are fine entertainment. Sometimes, however, they can be a bit boring. NOT the Natural History Museum! I was amazed to see, room after room, of things I hadn't been exposed to before! We were deeply engrossed in the mammal room- what  a diverse display!! The museum was so compelling, we visited twice over our five day DC visit!"
223,Great place,"Basically there was little that I haven't read about. But this might be because of my personal reading interests. However, still, it is a mostly for children museum I think."
224,Seems to be trapped in the 1950s,"The newly renovated fossil hall called ""Deep Time"" is excellent.  Go back in time and see fossils of the earliest preserved life forms.  You can watch the scientists in the fossil lab.  The dinosaurs are a highlight, especially the T-Rex taking a bite out of a Triceratops.  The exhibits continue with Ice Age Mammals.  Don't forget the rest of the museum.  ""Objects of Wonder"" has a diverse collection of wondrous objects."
225,First time impressed,"I was with a group visiting D.C. when I had the opportunity to visit the museum, but we didn't have much time.We were, however, given a private tour in the gem & mineral section of the vault tucked away in a highly secured area of the museum.   The precious gems and geological crystal formations that we witnessed were astonishing.  In addition, we were given a private tour for a 'behind the scenes' look at what goes on in the science and research departments.  A special 'thank you' to the ""Goddess of Volcanos"" (as I referred to her) who was gracious enough to explain what she did in the study of volcanos around the world.  It was truly a rare experience and the highlight of the trip.Once outside the vault, we roamed around to where the Hope Diamond was displayed.  Even if you aren't into this sort of thing, just witnessing this precious gem's existence was truly a rare experience.  The meteorites that were displayed were amazing, too.If I have the opportunity to do it again, I would definitely make more time."
226,Great way to spend time in DC,It was not very busy and the exhibits were great to see. There were plenty of guides available to answer questions.
227,Incredible! Worth a visit,"We brought our 3 granddaughters under 10 and they were totally enchanted with the insects exhibits, getting to hold a grasshopper, Caterpillar and touch a dead scorpion.  They loved the displays of skeletons of different animals as well as all the taxidermied animals on display. They especially loved  the Butterfly Pavilion, which was horribly overpriced. HIGHLY RECOMMEND the museum but be prepared to pay hefty fees for the Butterfly Pavilion."
228,"My favourite place to visit in Washington, DC","I had a 6 hour layover and decided to visit this museum. Loved it. I came for the dinosaur exhibit and was not disappointed. Wish I had more time, this place is huge."
229,Amazing museum,"A must do if you go to DC! As a wheelchair user i had no trouble with access, there are ramps lifts and a lot of restrooms"
230,My favorite of all of the Smithsonian museums,"The staff were informative and helped us formulate a plan - ""see the Hope Diamond first"". We love crystals and were very impressed by their crystals and gems. Was nice to see so many dinosaurs and T Rex depicted in a natural action pose. Would have liked to see more diaramas of early man. The place fills up fast."
231,"Excellent, children were fascinated !",It was so emotional going through the American History Museum.  Plan for at least two days to go through it all.  But it's worth it!
232,Worthwhile Place of Interest for the Entire Family,"how can you skip the natural history museum. they got the butterfly garden, a new exhibit on the dinosaurs and the gem collection is priceless. I haven't been here since 1985. some exhibits look familiar while others are brand new. there are various shops throughout the museum to get that dino shirt and stuff animals."
233,World Class Museum,"Loved it, more than expected and so very interesting. Definitely go and enjoy half a day seeing incredible sites."
234,Highlights,"Went here for a couple of hours on the last day before they closed the museum for Coronavirus concerns.  The museum is awesome and you could easily spend all day here if you want to see everything.  The exhibits are spread out onto two massive floors.  There is also a basement floor with a cafeteria.  We enjoyed the gem and mineral exhibit on the second floor, which has the beautiful hope diamond and many other incredible displays of rare and incredible jewelry.  If you have kids, they will be more interested in the dinosaur skeleton exhibits on the first floor, which were recently updated.  One overlooked exhibit, which we enjoyed, was an exhibit on the second floor which had skeletons of modern day animals.  Fascinating to see the skeletal structures of birds and reptiles.The entrance off the mall can get backed up due to security screening.  If the line is long, there is another entrance off Constitution Avenue that is usually a shorter wait to get in."
235,Sixteen Museums,"You can visit the museum on many levels so it's good to determine in advance what you want to do.  Always check out the exhibitions online so you can focus your visit.  IF you're coming with kids, try to schedule it so you can see talks of interest to them.  For example, I had a 7 and a 9 year old with me whose attention span was quite short.  But they really enjoyed the talk about tarantulas and seeing a tarantula fed at 1:30.  Other times are scheduled.With the kids we zipped through the fossils and dinosaur exhibit.  The biggest attraction turned out not to be the restored TRex, but the cartoon videos about the body at the end of the room which the 7 year old watched several times.  The mummies held their interest only shortly, but they greatly enjoyed the gem store, looking at all the stones.As an adult, I want to go back and see the special exhibit on Objects of Interest that held no interest for the kids.  We spent 2 hours with kids, but I would have stayed much longer as an adult.Over all, the museum renovations were great.  It doesn't appear so dusty and old as it once did.  And there are cafes on each level."
236,Focused on fossils,By far my favorite museum in Washington DC. I could have spent all day there and not have covered the entire museum. A definite must for anyone in the DC area.
237,Very interesting and accessible to all ages,"A good trip from the beginning of history, dinosours and even Egyptian mummies, I saw a lot of interactive activities for kids that made me wish I had a kid to take with me.  Plan a good 1 hour or more."
238,A little something for everyone,"A Must see! Dinosaurs, animals, gems, reptiles, fish, birds, mammals, fossils, extremely interesting history from all over the world"
239,Mineral and Gem exhibit is a must see,My nephew LOVVVVVES caterpillars and butterflies. They have wonder scientist on site with different kinds of bugs to educate you and your child
240,The best of the Smithsonians,We were looking forward to visiting but were very disappointed. I’d call this more an interactive learning centre than a museum. It’s great for kids/school trips to learn lots and is full of information but it doesn’t actually have any artefacts/objects in it which is what makes somewhere a museum. 99% of the items are casts or replicas only.
241,Amazing museum,"8 years old + 5 years old approved activity! A lot of interactive attraction, very nice and pleasant... and no fee to enter. We will come again because we had only 3 hours to visit it this first time. It's a bit too cold with air conditioner, so even for a very hot summer day take something with you :D"
242,Very good,"My wife and I spent the better part of our day here exploring all of the different exhibits. Among our favorites were the hope diamond, a samurai suite of armor, the mammals exhibit, and the mummies. We waited in line on a Saturday for about 30 minutes to get in. Plenty of food trucks were parked out by the line. Plan to eat lunch while waiting to go in to make your day more efficient."
243,Loved it,"This place was amazing. My only disappointments were not going into the live butterfly exhibit because of the long lines & that it had little in regards to primate exhibits. But overall, I enjoyed all the exhibits and took more than 500 pics. I will go again when in town. It’s educational and entertaining for kids. They even have a hands-on experience holding various insects."
244,Disappointing ,"I came here for a quick 45 minutes last weekend after coming from the air and space museum. We knew of the closing time beforehand, so it's not like the closing time was a surprise, even though it's way too early.The exhibits are great here. This might be the best natural history museum I've been to in general. I'd definitely like to come again, though I'd come at an earlier time, like at 10."
245,Spend Several Hours here,"Visited the Natural History museum for the first time and it was a big hit with the kids and the adults as well. The museum is laid out so that it is not overwhelming and the exhibits were perfect for a 5 and 7 year old boys to truly enjoy. While we spent about 2 hours just in the prehistoric wing, you could spend the whole day. I recommend going early since it does get crowded. We are going back for sure."
246,It is an old museum with old things in it.,Many areas to see. Did not get to see them all so I will return. Entrance that we used near gift shop was a smaller area and not clearly marked how to get to see other exhibits. What we did see was good  and much better wings of the museum which we did not see. Many members of the group thought that area was all of the museum which it was not.
247,Geology section was by far the best part,"Our first time to the museum and it was great! Security took a little bit if time but well worth it. We got to experience the Live Butterflies exhibit where you walk through a small habitat for beautiful butterflies.  The Gems and Mammal exhibits were awesome too. We didnt join a tour, just walked on our leisure which was fine because there's alot to read. A definite must see for visitors!"
248,One of the Most Impressive Smithsonian Museums in DC,"This is one of the places my family and I spent a day at during our trip to D.C. My 3 sons ages 16, 20 and 22 all love history. There is SO much to look at, take in and enjoy here! We each loved our time at this museum and the fact there is free admission is a true gift. If you or your traveling companions are history buffs this is a MUST!"
249,Here for the gems,"While we enjoyed the mammals, ocean and dinosaur areas, we ended up spending the most time (hours!)  in the gems/geology section!  Amazing displays of natural crystals - bend your mind that these are the result of chemical reactions - you will get to use your periodic table knowledge!"
250,not to be missed,My job had a private function one evening. Beautiful place filled with history. I hate I had on heels all night and didn't do as much exploring as I would've liked.
251,Wow!,"Really enjoyed this educational experience, lots of interesting stuff and great information about many things.Hands on learning for the kids and great artefacts on display.The only thing Smithsonian could improve is the cafeteria at all there joints"
252,Always very good ,"I’ve dreamed of going to the Natural Museum since I was little and I wasn’t disappointed. I wish my son (6 years) was more interested in the exhibits but, we spent over a hour exploring before my son was tired. It was magical still."
253,Peacful Retreat,The Butterfly Provillion wad GREAT. Had two butterflys land on me; it is not very wide but the amount of butterflys and flowers make up for it. We walk through a lot of the exhibits but did not see everything. Need 2 or 3 days just in this one musuem.
254,Some interesting things on display ,"If you’re headed into the mall specifically for museums, add this one to the top of your list! There is something for ages to enjoy. They mix the right amounts of learning and fun that puts a smile on everyone’s face! P.S. The cafeteria has the best potato salad I have ever tasted!!"
255,Busy but plenty to see,So nice to share history with the kids. History is always new no matter how well you know it. Great place for young kids.
256,Amazing and it’s free,"unique+kind,staff&attractions! watch yr step! could have stayed there for hrs！don't forget2make a donation@the door!"
257,Unexpected Treat,It’s free like everything else on the mall. We got there after a long day of walking. Prioritized the hope diamond which I didn’t realize was blue and then went to the butterfly exhibit. I feel like a full day still wouldn’t be long enough to appreciate the entire place. Not even close.
258,The sheer quantity overrides any issues with quality.,"This museum is very interesting. Art  history, sculture, modern and it is very big with area for study, read or relax in the silence."
259,So great I'd gladly pay to get in,"If you are into natural history, from prehistoric times, to the cause of diseases, to human development, evolution of man,then this is the place. Adults, teens, young children, everyone will find something here to captivate them. Visit!"
260,must see to beleive,Really enjoyed it.  Lots to see. We were riding sit down scooters and had no problems.  Easy to navigate round.  Beware there are long distances between museums even though map makes it look like right next door.  Museums are HUGE.
261,Always a Fun Day,"We were on a tight schedule so we just went right to the floor where they had the dinosaur bones and spent about an hour there. There were so many different kinds all in one place, so interesting. I didn't have time to read everything in an hour.  Very aussome."
262,Neat to see the animals and other exhibits,There is soooo much to see here and it all comes together nicely in a variety of ways!  It can get crowded but be patient and take advantage of wonderful exhibits.
263,Natural wonders,"This was one of my top choices while briefly visiting Washington DC and it didn't disappoint.  Even if you only have 1 our to (literally) run through before you have to head to the airport, this one is worth it for sure!  Best to give yourself 3 hours if you can.  The gems and minerals are incredible, the dinosaur bones, butterfly exhibit, so much to see and not enough time.  Make this one a priority."
264,Variety of Exhibits,This was a great experience for me and my group. There is so much to see and everything was straight forward and interesting. The exhibits are second to none. You could really spend a few days in here alone.
265,Good museum,"If you don’t know what to do with kids on the summer, there is the best place to bring them, have fun and enjoy, you can bring your own food and there has a cafeteria to do a stop and eat."
266,Great museum. ,"After grabbing some food from the food trucks outside the museum, waiting in a line that moved - albeit slowly, and passing thru security, we walked into a spectacular collection of artifacts and information. I was amazed how thousands of visitors were in the building and I never left claustrophobic. Yes, it was crowded in some areas, but never did I feel overwhelmed by the other tourists. The bathrooms were clean. The park service rangers/security personnel were polite and gracious. My group stayed for almost 5 hours. We visited all but one exhibition area. We didn't spend too much time reading every single description, but we did a fair share. When I am back in the area I'm hoping to visit another of these national treasures."
267,Awesome,"When we went into the Natural History Museum, everyone was in awe. We started with the Hope Diamond which was a diamond that some of my family members really wanted to see because they were Indian. We went around everywhere and there were so many beautiful rocks. There are not that many museums that excite kids, but since the displays were so amazing, even the kids didn't want to leave."
268,Bring comfortable shoes!,We all agreed to start here.  The line to get through security was long but moved quickly.  Started with the dinosaurs and everyone enjoyed that.  Looked at multiple exhibits.  The gem and mineral exhibit was impressive and colorful.  Only spent about 2-3 hours there and could have spent days.
269,Totally ruined my favorite museum ,"We thought it would be less crowded during the off peak period when school as back in session. Toddlers, exchange students, adults and seniors seem to be in the long line trying to get into the museum in the morning. The lines moved slowly because of the security check but once you got in, you had a blast. I enjoyed all the exhibits especially the gem room where huge gorgeous gems belonging to famous people like Marie Antoniette was on display. Do give yourself plenty of time to go through all the different parts of the museum. It is huge and has so much to see."
270,Amazing Museum !!!,"First time we've had a chance to visit since the dinosaur exhibit was renovated. It's even better than before. Do a little research before you go and spend the most time with your favorites - we loved the minerals and gems, the transportation, and the dinosaurs. Something for everyone."
271,GREAT EXPERIENCE,"Great place for adults and children alike.  Check out the dinasour section and don't forget to go upstairs to check out the Hope Diamond and other minerals, etc.  Forget the mammal exhibit...just a depressing collection of stuffed animals.  But the rest of the place is awesome!!!!"
272,Very dissappointing,"We had an extra hour or so before another appointment.  We hit the highlights of the dinosaurs, mummies and the big stones!"
273,Somewhat Disappointing,"We went with our son (11) and daughter (9) and for the most part they were well entertained, the entry price was worth it. They enjoyed many of the exhibits and it was good to see some outside of glass boxes (NYC take note!). There were interactive elements, particular fun was seeing what you would look like as a caveman. the Hope Diamond like many famous pieces of art was a little disappointing but that says more about my expectations than the piece. Whilst we didn't read every article or stare at every exhibit, we found it well placed to wander around. This also meant the kids didn't get too bored.There is a cafe but to be honest we didn't even look in it, and of course the obligatory gift shop.All in all good value for the family education."
274,Visit the Dinosaur Exhibit ,"What a lovely, interesting place to visit. I remember going as preteen on a field trip from NYC.  I loved it then and love it now.  Especially when I can bring my 6 year old granddaughter to see all the wonderful exhibits. She was absolutely fascinated by it all. Be sure to check the schedule and try to join a tour. They are free and quite interesting.  Visit in the spring or summer to see the butterflies in all their glory! (Not sure if it is open during the winter) these pics were taken in July. They do have places to eat but it can get pricey.  Bring a bag lunch and you are good to go. Relax, stroll thru the extensive exhibits, and enjoy. You won't regret it!"
275,Love the jewel exhibit,We had an hour to see the museum as we arrived late and the museum closes at 5:30 pm.  We were not able to see all the sections. If I get time I would would definitely spend more time here. It was nice with lots of things to see. The entry was free and the place crowded with people.
276,Great Museum ,"I had never been to washington, and knew this was one place I had to go.  You have to see to believe all that was in this building"
277,The MUSEUM,"Just incredible! Don’t go thinking you’ll only be there an hour.  There’s so much to see and even the things you think won’t be of interest to you, somehow become of interest.  Exceptionally well done and well worth a visit."
278,Not as good as expected,"I'd go back at least once a year, always a great day. Too much to see to list here. Must see in D.C."
279,Excellent collection,"We visited on a Sunday morning, right when they opened. It wasn't crowded so it was easy to see the exhibits and move through quickly. The exhibits are facinating and well maintained. Highly recommend fitting this into your itinerary."
280,Excellent ,"If only I can spend 1 day here at Natural History museum, I really would love to. Even if I'm in my 30s, I still feel excited seeing these creatures that God created. Everyone will be in awe! I love to read the general info that they provide and it refreshes my mind. Highly recommended!"
281,Awesome - Hope Diamond to T-Rex all with a great restaurant,"What an amazing day.  My kids 10, 8 and 6 loved it as did my husband and I.It was so well worth the visit, free to enter and they have fantastic experiences for all ages.  Our girls learnt so much today and so did we...Thank you to all the staff there.  You guys do an amazing job."
282,Amazing ,"If you arrive and get into the museum by 10:20ish, you can take a 1 hour informational tour that hits all the highlights! Take this and then go back and look more closely at anything you’d like! Lots of awesomeness to see!"
283,Fun place for kids or adults,"My sister and I spent most of the day there viewing the exhibits. There was a variety of topics covered from the development of the dinosaurs and what made them extinct, to the sea lives to the development of the humans."
284,Another must see in DC,From the moment you walk in you are faced with a full sized elephant in the centre of the main hall. Take your time here because there so many fascinating  exhibits & information to take in.
285,Grandkids weekday trip,We stopped in for a quick visit and were disappointed we didn't have more time!!! There were so many exhibits to see and they were so informative! Definitely worth visiting! Can't wait to go back!
286,So well done-it makes it easy to love nature,"Visited with hubby and my kids aged around 10 yrs old, which is a pretty good age to visit though it's not so much for young kids. We arrived just in time for the free guided tour after storing our things in the free lockers (free because they give you back your quarter, so bring a quarter). you can purchase a map for $1 but it's not necessary to get around (I didn't mind, it was more a souvenir/donation). The gems and minerals gift shop was impressive and had reasonable prices for the minerals.. The lady giving the tour was very knowledgeable and brought us around most parts but didn't go into detail and go through all exhibits more of he why and an overview, with background about the Smithsonian museums beginnings. The gems and minerals exhibit was temporarily closed  that day to our great disappointment because my son and I especially wanted to see that. They did have the Hope diamond section open with a few accompanying impressive displays at least."
287,A Museum Must!,"GIVE YOURSELF TWICE THE TIME YOU ESTIMATE FOR THIS PLACE….….if so you may leave near schedule.Most reviews put this SMITHSONIAN at the top of DC’s must visit museums. I personally rate the AIR AND SPACE place higher, but that is just a guy thing. Although the latter will appeal to dads and sons, EVERYONE will enjoy THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. It’s really special.I am not going to detail what can be seen here except to say I was not aware of anything lacking. The most I can do is give a few tips for this must do place:	TIPS – start early if you want to do more than one SMITHSONIAN in the day. An early start also beats the crowds. Museum opens 10AM.- the museum does not have parking. Nearby parking can be seen online.- the closest metro station is FEDERAL TRIANGLE only 0.2milles/5mins walk.- the museum has quite a good cafe area for the peckish."
288,Smithsonian of Natural History,Wish I had more time to visit the museum. However with the two hour parking limit it makes relaxing and enjoying the experience a little difficult!
289,Worth Seeing!,"Even though I waited six months after the Fossil Hall reopened (it was a long five years) and visited on a weekday, there were still respectable crowds.  Plan before you enter.  If you want to see life from the beginning, walk through the main exhibit and bear left.  The signs will guide you from one dated station to the next.  Small dioramas illustrate typical environments.  One disappointment:  the exhibit no longer contains fossils from the Burgess Shale (though perhaps those have been moved -- for instance, the placoderm head and the megalodon jaw are in the Ocean Hall).If you are just there for the wonderful Wankel T-rex (which the museum has on loan for the next 50 years), you will easily find it, dead center in the main hall, biting into a Triceratops crest.  (I loved that its long tail, now properly elevated per recent research, stretched overhead beyond the exhibit case.  The curators did the same with the Diplodocus tail to stunning effect.)  Please note that the T-rex skull in the exhibit is a cast.  The original sits a floor below in a small case so you can get a really close look at those terrible teeth.There are videos and touchable items throughout.  If you like dinosaurs, you will love the refurbished hall."
290,Large exhibitions with plenty to do and see,This was a nice place to spend several hours. We stayed just 4 but could have made it 6 at least! Watch out for the parking out front. No meter and we could not feed the kiosk. They towed us because we stayed until after 4 p.m. No sign to read where we were about parking issues. So many things to see and read about. This was very interesting.
291,Fantastically presented exhibits ,We only had a few hours luckily it wasn’t too crowded. We went in to see the Hope diamond but found so many more beautiful jewels and gems on display!!!
292,Always interesting to admire the natural world.,Natural History Museum houses beautiful displays of wildlife and natural wonders.  Visitors get an up close view of animals and other world wonders.  This is one of the best museums of all Smithsonian Institute.
293,Always interesting,You need to pick one area and then skim the rest if you want to do in a day. Too much to take in. I chose the geology room to geek out in as I could have spent a full day there. The bacteria exhibit freaked me out. Great museum especially for educating the children.
294,A lot of everything ,"Wanted to visit here for a long time. And it didn’t disappoint. Well laid out exhibits. Something for all ages. Lots to see and do. Gift shops are good. 3 floors of activity. There’s dinos, animals, insects,birds and other things to see. Great museum!"
295,Incredible!,"The museum is back to its former glory with a much needed renovation. In fact, it is better than ever. It feels more airy and spacious, and the displays are better organized. All of the must sees are there (Hope Diamond, dinosaur fossils, etc) but in a must more pleasant environment."
296,Enjoyable visit,"This is a most see, we all enjoy and same time learn alot, I feel like I am walking into my history class again and also impart the what I’ve learn to my kids"
297,Where knowledge resides,Went there at the end of August and I was a little disappointed. The displays looked good but I had been expecting to see the “real” thing but most exhibits were in fact casts.The Egypt display amounted to 3 glass cases which was very disappointing to me as this is an area that really interests me and being the museum it was I expected a lot more
298,Not my favorite,"I'm really not a science-y person so this is not really my interest level. However, my husband is science-y and was very interested in all of these exhibits. For the sheer amount of specimens they have, the museum is laid out very well, with enough space to be able to see everything. I think smaller children would really enjoy this museum."
299,You need days to really appreciate this museum,"There are unsubstantiated theories described that have no basis in fact.  However, the major conflicting theory isn't described.  One sided presentaion."
