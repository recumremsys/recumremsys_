0,"A 5, with an asterick","Family with a 8, 9, and 11 year old.  The museum is extremely well done.  With kids limited attention span, we started in Africa and Asia, and we probably should have started downstairs in the exhibits of famous musicians.  They basically have a small exhibit on almost every country in the world.  It is really cool.  However, much of it is similar and blends together.  We spent about 3 hours there.  You could spend 6+ hours there if you wanted to watch all the television clips."
1,Day Trip from Prescott,This is a fantastic experience for young or old.  Our family of 3 ( 8 year old and mid-forties) really enjoyed this.  This is more like a musical experience than a museum. You are given a headset that interacts with each of the music stations. Our daughter enjoyed the rooms where you can play all of the instruments.  So many unique instruments to try!  This place is huge and there is so much to see so I would plan for a minimum of 3 hours.  The food at the cafe was surprisingly good so be sure to give it a try!
2,Our only mistake was showing up at 3pm,This is a fun place for young and old.  Interactive displays are great.  Great history of music. Highly recommended.
3,"Awesome day-long fun for grown up music lovers (with kids, though, maybe an hour or two tops)",We spent 3 hours here and needed more. Really well put together and so comprehensive. Great museum and good for kids - young and older. Highly recommended.
4,Best Kept Secret,"MIM is a museum for all ages.  Everyone will find something they enjoy.  We have been 3 times with various friends and we all felt we wish we had set aside more time to visit.  There is a performer oriented section (think Taylor Swift, Johnny Cash, Elvis, etc), a genre oriented section (Country, Jazz, Blues, etc) and a country oriented section (Mexico, Brazil, US and even an Arizona specific section)."
5,So much to see!,This museum has something for everyone The kids liked all the touchable buttons & seemed to enjoy all the novel instruments. The adults enjoyed the unique instruments too as well the stories behind them. We will go back to glean more info without the kids sometime. There’s so much to see!
6,Interesting ,Very well done displays. Loved the audio tours of each area. Long dunno might be to much for young children but the do have interactive areas which children of all ages will enjoy.
7,“Over the top” museum experience!,This is a museum one could spend many many hours touring. Very interesting and educational. For anyone who enjoys music this is beyond a treat.
8,Over the top musical history experience!,"Plenty to view and even kept my 9 year old boy paying attention! If you are in the Phoenox area, you should spend a couple hours here and check it out!"
9,A Must-See (and Hear)!,This museum has something for everyone it is interactive and the kids absolutely love it because it’s not only educational but it’s fun. The exhibits are interesting for both adults and children.  I’ve also been there for several concerts and the acoustics are amazing and the performers that they book are always outstanding.  I highly recommend spending an afternoon at the MIM with or without children .
10,A Must-See (and Hear)!,"I was impressed how the Museum organized the 10,000 musical pieces throughout the very large museum. The upper level has the Geographic Galleries, staging the various pieces by world regions. It was interesting to see the evolutionon of drums, strings, horns of different types (including animal horns).  I now know the difference between lyres and guitars. I also know bagpipes aren't solely from Scotland."
11,Around the World,"This really needs a full day or two day visit.  We (party of 4) started with the special exhibits, had lunch, then went to the upstairs exhibits.  The upstairs is HUGE and in a way information overload for a full day.  We all thoroughly enjoyed it though."
12,Music Educational,"We really enjoyed the exhibits,  and found it very interesting. Lots to see and learn. We only bought the 1 day pass,  but could have gone back for another day."
13,A Special Event at MIM,"Plan to spend at least 3 hours at this Museum. It is full of history & very well laid out. The headphones provided with the ability of the ""self-guided"" exploration made this an exceptional experience!"
14,So interesting!,"So many musical instruments from around the world. Separated in regions. A head set tour that describes many of the exhibits as you walk to them. Educational, entertaining and fun."
15,Comfortable Shoes,"Fabulous facility and exhibits.  Well curated, including the accompanying videos.  We visited on a rainy Saturday.  The museum handled nearly 2000 visitors fairly comfortably - yes lots of people, but never felt rushed or having to wait.  Spent 6 hours including 45 minutes for lunch and a 30+ minute tribute concert for Ella Fitzgerald and felt we saw only about one-third of the exhibits.  If we ever return to Phoenix, MIM will definitely be a re-visit."
16,Superb museum,This museum  is a most see for anyone visiting AZ.  Music instruments and music culture from every country in the world.  Absolutely fantastic.
17,Utterly stunning and overwhelming,"The MIM is a great place to visit for adults and children.  We arrived in the morning and didn't leave until mid-afternoon.  We had lunch in the cafeteria which was clean, moderately priced and quite tasty.  We tried to see everything, but we too tired to do so."
18,Superb find,headphones to listen to the music was greatlayout detail made for good flow of exhibits throughout the museum
19,Maybe  the BEST MUSEUM in the World,This place is gigantic and you probably need 2 days to see all of it.  The mechanical instruments exhibit and the artist ones are awesome.  Playing different instruments was really fun too.  The way they have the audio system set up is so cool all you need to do is walk by an exhibit and you start hearing about it.  Definitely worth stopping in to see this place
20,A Musical Day,"Excellent Museum. The guided tour was fantastic, with musical accompaniment to pair with each instrument. Enjoyed the musicians' hall of fame, the mechanical instrument section and various countries' unique repertoires! I even got to play a theremin (it was on my bucket list!)."
21,Hits the right note!,Nice for the Music Buffs and History Buff. This well thought of and organized museum is nice to walk through. With headsets supplied you can take a gander at exhibits and get a taste of the indigenous feel of music and history. You can stop at a country you wish to learn of and observe the different tempos and styles of music.
22,Spring Training,Plan for a whole day at this exhibition - the self guided tour headset is amazing - lets you focus on the sounds of the instruments. I didn’t budget enough time though! We will be back!!
23,Fabulous museum,The admission fee of $20 is worth every penny. This museum is so extensive and well laid out. Words can barely describe this treasure!
24,Deserves it's #1 ranking,The MIM is amazing and the staff is very helpful. The largest collection is a must see if you are in the Phoenix area.
25,Incredible,"Excellent museum, we were really there in February, 2018.  So much to see and do related to musical instruments from all over the world — just a little overwhelming. They give concerts here, too."
26,A Must-see for Music Aficionados,"The MIM is an exceptional museum.  Plan the whole day as there is so much to see, even for the non musician in the family"
27,Amazing museum!,You can spend all day at this venue. There are two floors of exciting musical instruments. They have special exhibits in the second floor is full of instruments from different countries throughout the world. They have a great Cafe with healthy food! And a wonderful patio.
28,VERY interesting place!,Light and bright presentation of instruments from violins to calliopes.  Something for all ages of our family plus a lovely courtyard for lunch or a snack.
29,MIM,My friend and her 15 year old viola player son visited and thought this was an amazing museum as do I.  I also am a big fan of the concert venue and have been to many performances!!
30,Tour the world in a few hours.,Love this Museum! So many rooms and history to discover. You can see everything from old rock and roll 2 musical instruments from foreign countries. A lot of cool things I didn't even know existed! This is a great place to bring your kids we're just walk around and discover new things.
31,A Definite Must In Phoenix - Grt Museum - a Grt Staff,our family of nine including teenagers went to this and all found it very interesting. Very well laid out with helpful staff. Great value for the cost.
32,Perfect for a rainy day!,"Fantastic exhibits, amazing acoustics, clean and contemporary, we love the MIM and have seen at least a half dozen concerts here. Probably the best designed music venue in the southwest. Looking forward to seeing our next show there."
33,"An absolute gem.  Had not idea what to expect, but it is so well done!",We have visited the museum several times through the years and always enjoyed the new exhibits. MIM has exhibitions of musical instruments from around the world. Takes a full six hours to see.
34,Wonderful museum,An exceptional expert iui once and opportunity in Phoenix! E ticket helpful. No entry to spec iui al exhibit un loo ess you buy it to add to your entry ticket. Excellent food in cafeteria. Plan to spend 6 or more hours to see it all. Incredible
35,MIM is Fantastic,"They claim there is nothing like this museum, and I believe it. It has musical history displays (various instruments from the U.S. and around the world. It has displays featuring famous artists who have donated various things. It also has special displays that are either put together or on loan from elsewhere that rotate from time to time. Also - their concert venue is beautiful - simple and intimate. Good selection of artists and musical styles."
36,What an awesome museum,"We went with a group of kids and they loved the many interactive instruments, the unique musical history and the live piano that wes on the main floor."
37,Wonderful museum,The MIM is the most beautiful museum you will ever see. Guided tours too! Resturant starbucks. Events for children Concerts too. Preepare at least4 hours to see most things.. Reasonbly priced
38,Amazing look at music from different cultures!,"This is a very nice place for a concert, good acoustics, good view of the stage.  The museum is nice too."
39,Ecella t displays with audio systems,Great museum with so many interesting instruments. Everything is laid out nicely with plenty of space.  Allow at least a couple of hours to see everything.
40,Amazing Museum,You will LOVE this museum!  Take advantage of this amazing museum!! Take the kids or go alone it will be worth the visit!!
41,A True Gem the Desert,"Wow! Multiple galleries devoted to different continents. Audios were great. I agree in part with some reviews that not the best place to bring kids.But not only were the displays interesting, one also gets a geography and cultural lesson. Best $20 spent for the afternoon."
42,A Don’t Miss,Anyone living or traveling to Phoenix should not miss this Attraction. This is a great destination for young or old. Educational as well as Entertaining.
43,Highlight of Our Trip,"A must see.  Over 6,700 musical instruments.  Plan on a day trip.  It was fantastic.  There is every country in the world.  Unbelievable."
44,Exceptional,"A Special Event at MIMSince their opening, we have each been to the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) several times. My wife and I attended a special charity event there, but got to see almost nothing of the museum, itself, as we were in the auditorium. My wife attended another event, but it was similar - almost no time to see the museum. I, on the other hand, did take family members, for a complete day at MIM, and did get to see nearly everything. In June, we got to see much more of the museum, while attending a business dinner on-property.The evening began with much of the museum’s exhibits available to us, so we took the time to explore - something that my wife had not done before. We spent almost 2 hours in the main exhibits area, which features so many common musical instruments, including exhibits on many of the musicians, who made them famous, such as Ravi Shankar and his Sitar, and Wu Man’s Pipa.The museum building, is architecturally interesting, more so inside, than on its rather basic exterior, and the exhibits are all well displayed, lit and many feature video monitors, playing the music of either the featured musician, or the featured instrument. We were given headphones, that tied into the videos, by proximity, so that one could privately enjoy the audio portion of the program.Though we only had the one large exhibit hall open, we easily filled the 2 hours, before we retired to the interior courtyard for a reception, and then dinner, catered by the museum. The service for the meal was very good, even with a portion being buffet-style, while a portion was served. Now, I do not know if the catering was done by the same staff, which cooks for, and serves meals in the little restaurant on-site? I should have asked.Even with our somewhat abbreviated visit, we both enjoyed the displays, and I think that at least two, had been added, from my previous visit, in 2017.Now, my wife and I just need to spend a full day at the MIM, and take it all in, plus dine at Café Allegro - make a full day out of it. Predicated on my visit with family (2 youngsters in the group), I would suggest at least 3 hours, with 4 being an ideal."
45,A Must See!!!,"Took family members who were visiting for Christmas, and everyone was really pleasantly surprised at what a cool and well done museum this is.  If you haven't heard of it you may be expecting some storefront in a mall, but this place is huge and really well laid out.  There are exhibits from every region/country in the world with a well curated explanation of the tribal or other roots or histories of the instruments on display, plus videos throughout showing the instruments in use.  It is also in a way a great geography lesson, as you see variations of certain instruments as they change from region to region.  Give yourself at least 3-4 hours - probably more.  The Africa room alone took well over an hour.  And don't miss the artists recordings and interactive exhibits on the first floor."
46,Entertaining and Informative,"This is an outstanding collection of musical instruments, styles presented in view of the entire world. WOW.A minor example a one gallon steel oil can turned into a professional sounding electric guitar.A wonderful live music venue.A inter active music room.See the World of music.You need more than a half day to enjoy it all."
47,musical instruments,"The museum is very informative and educational and the staff is friendly and available for questions. We stopped by just to see if there were any guitars on display and to our surprise they had instruments from every corner of the world. I am of Ukrainian descent and I didn’t expect to see instruments like the Bandura, which is played in Ukraine. We were there for 3 hours but to see every display requires more time. Next time we are in Phoenix we will definitely visit MIM !!"
48,A Destination for young and old,"The MIM is an awesome introduction into the musical culture of many different nations. The displays are grouped into regions, such a as Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Asia etc. Each grouping has displays from different countries instruments and videos of various styles of music. They also have a section of artists, each are popular musicians of different genres.  If you are a musician or enjoy different styles of music, you could spend hours here."
49,A destination for all who live in or visit Phoenix,"This was our first visit to the MIM and it exceeded our expectations! The building is beautiful and outdoor eating area looked lovely. The museum is so well organized with the exhibits displayed by continents. It is truly amazing to see all the different historical and more recent instruments. What a great idea to have headsets to be able to hear clips and see them being played on the monitors. It is also a lesson in world geography with maps at each display. We especially enjoyed hearing the “Apollonia” dance organ performance that is featured at 12 and 3pm. Our heritage is Belgium, so it was special to see this instrument from Belgium’s history. There are instruments and clothing displays from artists. We were at the museum for almost 4 hours and it was not enough time! The museum does have the option to purchase a 1/2 price ticket for a return visit which is great idea but unfortunately didn’t work for us. There is also a hands on room to play the instruments...drums, gongs, xylophones. Fun for the young and young at heart! We will return again and definitely well deserving of their Trip Advisor rating."
50,Incredible collection!,"The collection is separated by region and country. There is so much to see I would suggest the two day discounted tickets. We didn't and now have to return soon to see the rest of the collection. There is also a 'Hands-On' room where children, and adults can try their skill on various instruments. Come early and plan lunch in their cafeteria. The MIM is now our go to attraction when out of town guests visit."
51,Amazing Experience,Great one of a kind musical instrument collection displayed perfically. Great helpfully staff of mostly volunteers. You get a headset for the tour so as you move from exibate to exibate you listen to the sounds of the various instruments and cultures. Don't miss the cafe it's also outstanding.
52,"Nice museum, nice place for a concert",There are more instruments here than you can imagine.  Very interesting.  We spent 3 hours seeing all of the exhibits.
53,Worth a trip to Phoenix just for this museum,"A well done presentation of instruments from around the world. Nice exhibits with flawless bluetooth-flat panel videos. All nicely done and put together. We also attended a James McMurtry concert the night before in their most excellent 300 seat hall. Well worth several hours or two days to see it all.Not cheap for museum entrance at $20, so I just joined as  member, for a better rate"
54,MIM,"I visited the Musical Instrument Museum in November 2019.  I got there at opening time - 9 am.  The museum gives you headphones which enable you to listen to videos of music at each exhibit.  Upon entry into the museum, I was greeted by an incredible exhibit of guitars.  I then went up to the second floor.  The museum has exhibits with musical instruments from every country in the world.  The museum has at least 10,000 musical instruments.  If you choose to look at every exhibit, every instrument and watch every video, I think you could easily be here for more than a day.  I went quickly through things which were of less interest and stopped for things which were of greater interest.  I went through Africa quickly and went through Asia carefully.  The exhibits on China, Japan, Singapore, India, Philippines were very interesting.  They even had instruments from North Korea.  After Asia was Australia and then South America / Latin America.  I liked the exhibits on Brazil and Mexico.  The Europe section was also very detailed and interesting.  Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and others - all very interesting.  Finally are all the exhibits about the USA.  On the first floor were exhibits on various artists such as Maroon 5, Elvis, Glen Campbell and many others.  I had a coffee in the Allegro Cafe.  After my coffee I made a second pass to look at my favorite exhibits and videos a second time.  I look forward to my next time in the Phoenix and Scottsdale area and I will surely go back to this musuem again."
55,Visit with family,"This should be on everyone’s list while in Scottsdale.  It was surprisingly awesome!  The authentic exhibit was superbly organized by country of origin.  In addition, the traditional method of wearing headsets and pushing buttons as you approach a number was replaced with headsets that automatically sense the display you are standing in front of.The food at the museum cafeteria was also fresh, locally sourced, and very well presented.  Delicious!"
56,A happy place,This museum is full of surprises. It is an architecturally beautiful building with a phenomenal collection excellently presented. You will be introduced to instruments and music you likely never heard or seen before -- and probably never even thought existed. The headphones allow you to hear excerpts of music from places around the world. Can't imagine how anyone would not find this place fascinating and mind-expanding.
57,Beyond Fantastic! A must see!,"Several locals had recommended a visit to MIM and we are so glad we visited.  The museum features not only an amazing collection of all types of musical instruments from all continents and time periods, but also videos and audios of artists playing traditional, ceremonial, and contemporary music on them.  The videos also include dances and costumes.  It was amazing .  You could spend an entire day there!  The building itself is stunning.  MIM is built on the belief that all people can be united by their common love for song and dance....the language of the soul!"
58,Unique & Wonderful Experience,"This museum is only 10 years old but has a fantastic collection of instruments from around the globe. They have an amazing auditorium that they book musical acts from all over the globe in. Very interactive, so kids love it. Allow a full day and soak it in because it's way better than Nashville or Graceland or any other music museum I can think of."
59,One of the coolest museums in Phoenix ,This is a very unique museum.  It's well organized and let's you see the world of instruments and the history behind them.
60,It is awesome,"This is one of the most amazing museums you will ever visit. Something for people of all ages. We send all of our company there, and each time they rave about their experience. Don’t plan on a quick in and out. Too much to see and experience."
61,Absolutley amazing!!!,"This is by far one of the best museums around. Interactive, fascinating, interesting. Entry fee is a little high but worth it. Don't miss this treasure."
62,very through representation of all countries,What a wonderful experience.  Displays of instruments from all over the world.  Artist displays interesting and informative.  Very glad we went and would go again
63,5 stars aren't enough!,"This is definitely one of my favourite museums. So many instruments to see, so informative, and the audio tour was great. Fantastic collection and well worth the money spent. A music lovers paradise!"
64,Musical Instruments Galore,"An incredibly comprehensive museum, with a narrated self guided tour via headphones.  5 hours wasn't enough time."
65,Great morning out,"Never lets me down! Well-organized exhibits with many videos, instruments from all displays of over the world with the dress of each country; Asia, Africa,European,etc. There are displays of well-known American musicians. Special features are presented frequently, a collection of  guitars, etc. My guests always enjoy going with me, a local museum not to be missed! There is a cafe to get a bite to eat, an interesting book store/gift shop.At night, one can attend a concert that is always fun!"
66,A Museum Unlike any I ‘ve seen. Incredible  depth . Worthy of a full day.,The Musical Instrument Museum is a must see when in the Phoenix area. A truly wonderful collection of musical instruments from all over the world. Unbelievable how much we really do have in common with everyone all over the earth!Carve out the time and go you won’t be disappointed.
67,Prepare to spen DAYS in here!,Best music museum I’ve ever visited.  So much to see and there is an interactive area for you to try out some of the instruments they have on display.
68,The current Congolese masquerades and musical instruments are worth catching,"So many exhibits that were well laid out and paired with music videos we could hear through our headsets.  We only got through a very small portion of the museum, so will have to travel back to Phoenix another time to see more."
69,A full day at the least,"Well organized. A docent suggested doing Africa first, a good suggestion. A good value. Not just about instruments but musicians and styles of music as well"
70,Wonderful visit!,The MIM is a surprising museum that had way more than I initially thought it would. The history withing the instruments and the exhibits are interesting and you can spend hours without even realizing it. This is definitely an all day trip and is perfect for an indoor activity.
71,It should more properly be called Museum of music of the world.  We love it!,Acoustic Alchamy was fantastic and a great venue with great acoustics.A fantastic place with a small 200 seat or so venue
72,Paradise!,"This museum is world class! The cost is very reasonable and if you have the time, you could easily spend most of the day there. They have designed it so it is self paced and self guided, which allows you to enjoy it at your pace.  There is a cafe on site so you can take a break during your day.  Another great find is a family room that has toys,books, couches, and a bathroom.  A great opportunity to take a break with little ones, as needed.This is such a well designed museum and so clean and comfortable, it is easy to soak it all up.  One note, my children are older and I tried to vizualize how it would  be for parents with young children, because there are so many things they would want to touch.My personal reccomendation would be, to go and  plan that it will be a shorter time then needed to see the whole  thing and just see what you can see.  I don't think you could do it all with littles. (probably 6 and under)"
73,Suprising in its sope and interest,"The MIM, or musical instrument Museum, in Phoenix Arizona really deserves a 1!. This museum is just celebrating 10 years in existence and it looks brand new. It is super clean and well laid out.On the second floor there are a variety of rooms dedicated to music from the United States, Europe Latin America, Oceana,Asia, Southeast Asia Indonesia, Africa and all of its individual countries, and more. Please plan to spend three or four hours here separated by lunch in their cafeteria and enjoy something to eat out on the patio with the great Arizona weather.Each guest is given a headset that is activated as you visit all the different sections of the museum. When you approach A display of music from a certain country or area in the world, you will be greeted by a video and your headset will automatically pick up the music to go along with the video. Many of the musical displays link dancing with the music from all the various countries in the world. Not only is this a great way to hear the music of each country, but you learn where each country is in the world as a map is shown above the display. There is also a café And cafeteria,  an outside dining area, a gift shop and instrument room and an interactive room for each guest to participate with various instruments."
74,You will love it,"This museum is celebrating its 10th anniversary and it is unique beyond description; not to say that it is inexpensive but it is worth every penny that it costs to enter and if you have all day, it should take all day or more.  You are given head phones when you pay admission and the head phones are activated when you are within a certain distance of the area that you are observing.  We started upstairs in the ""Africa"" section and couldn't believe how fast the time passed - but try to pay attention to the time so that you can actually see most of the exhibits in the day of your visit."
75,One of the best museums I've visited!,We spent almost six hours visiting this Museum. It is full of beautiful and inventive instruments and the audio-guide is revealing all the information needed.
76,Very extensive collection,Fantastic! Lots to see and listen to. No lectures unless you want them. Just music from everywhere including an air guitar.
77,FANTASTIC,"This museum is simply wonderful and one of a kind. You have musical instruments around the world and audio guide that you can listen to the music that was played with these instruments. There is also a room where anyone can play some of these instruments live. A must see because you will definitely learned a lot from different cultures, their love for music in different countries. Well organized and layout."
78,Stellar!,We are so glad we took others advice and visited this museum. Amazing how musical instruments have evolved over generations from an animal skin stretched over a gourd to some of today's more complex instruments. It illustrates how man's need for music permeates all societies.
79,Wonderful,"I’m not a museum person, but this museum is truly entertaining since you can listen to the various instruments from around the world. Perfect for a rainy day. But go early as the lines get long by 11am."
80,Great Museum!,"One of the highlights of the Phoenix area. A fascinating, immersive space, and great for children as well. Highly recommended."
81,Everything You've Heard is True,"There is alot to see at the Musical Instrument Museum. The headsets given to you work really great with the exhibits. As you walk up, you hear the description then when you walk away, it fades out; it is really nice. Along with all of the people working, they were very nice and helpful."
82,Not a museum person but loved it,More instruments than you could ever think of. Very unique. The layout is great. Listening as you walk through the museum is the best. Put on their earphones and enjoy
83,Volunteer,We loved this place! I feel like anyone of all ages would be entertained. We did the self-guided tour with the headphones and it was so fancy. We would totally go again if we had guests visiting.
84,Lots to see,"So much to learn about from all around the globe! Interactive parts, and guides pleasant and have inside information. Go see and hear huge organ at 12 or 3. Restaurant on premises have great choices but get there before 2 for best selections. Mesquite sourdough rolls very unique! Gift shop seemed overpriced."
85,Exceeded My High Expectations,"This is a wonderful museum, and the audio headsets add a tremendous amount to the experience.  In contrast to the headsets at many other museums, you do not have to enter a numeric code each time you wish to hear the audio track that is intended to accompany a given display.  You simply walk up to the display and the audio begins to play.  I spent about four hours at this museum, and I could have easily spent four more.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
86,Wonderful venue and very impressive,Great place (one of the best in The Valley) to spend a weekend..I took my sister and significant other to the MIM and they enjoyed very much.. it was my second visit and I look forward to take the rest of the family
87,Didn’t expect this!,"A wonderful museum with very nice landscaping.  Instruments of all types, made from all materials, laid out geographically, so that the visitor can easily compare across cultures.  Best of all, each display has an associated video so you can hear the instruments you are looking at.  Very nice.  Also, regular concerts in the music hall.Well worth the time."
88,Great - older kids,"We learned something new at every turn, the displays were thorough, detailed and incredibly interesting.  Information and history of both the instruments and the musicians."
89,"An unusual, superb museum",There is so much to see and hear at this museum! The presentation of each country is very aesthetically pleasing and viewer friendly. I recommend taking at least 3 hours for a visit!
90,Great Museum,There’s so much to see.  Be prepared to spend hour and hours.  Every  genre of music and musical instruments  one can imagine and more.  Fabulous collect.  Great facility.  Several trips are required to experience the entire collection.
91,OMG Music  - Joy,"We were blown away by this museum!  The number of instruments is impressive andeducational.  I never heard of so many different instruments from around the world.  It is fascinating.  We happened to attend around Christmas when there were special activities for children so we took the grands.  Very well done.  Even without the special activities the children enjoyed the museum especially the percussion room just for them.   There is a beautiful, small concert hall allowing the museum to host special musical guests. Even the gift shop is top shelf and I am not often impressed by museum gift shops!"
92,Great museum,"My 18-year old son and I weren't entirely sure what to expect at the Musical Instrument Museum and were so glad we went. The museum itself is a beautiful, modern building with great design. When you pay for your ticket, you are handed a set of headphones with a receiver attached. As you walk through the museum, many of the exhibits have video monitors playing and as you walk up to screen, the audio automatically starts playing. The short videos show many of the instruments you're looking at, being played. So aside from what you hear in your headphones, the Musical Instrument Museum is completely silent, which made for a very unique experience. There are over 7,000 instruments from 200 countries, each beautifully displayed. Along with instruments, you'll see costumes and other paraphernalia. It's fascinating to hear how music evolves from one country to the next, and over time. Every genre you can imagine is covered. You'll see instruments and costumes from famous artists, there was a really neat Steinway piano exhibit, beautiful guitars and so much more. You can breeze through the museum in about two hours, but it's well worth planning more time or buying a 2-day ticket so you can go back the next day. There are plenty of benches to sit down and relax for a few minutes. You'll also find food and a gift shop. The first floor of the museum has one room where you can play all sorts of percussion instruments, a harp and assorted other noise-making tools. The main lobby has a piano open to anyone to play. There's plenty of parking and the museum is pretty conveniently located right off Route 101. It's really is a very unique experience and well worth seeing."
93,Great concert!!,"5 stars aren't enough to express how much we enjoyed and were amazed by this museum.  Anyone who enjoys music, whether listening, playing, singing, history of...  of any style of music should visit this place.  And plan on at least half a day.  We see why they sell 2-day tickets as the collections are fabulous, immense, well researched and cover music from around the world, all types and styles.  It is well worth the time and ticket price!"
94,A Musical Experience for every age ,"Pick up your guidePORT headset and start upstairs in the most amazing display of musical instruments, all pegged to country and area. The headset automatically connects you to the music appearing on the flat screen TV as you position yourself at the music notes symbol  But the sheer number of instruments and displays just takes one breath away. We will return again and again."
95,Hidden gem,Enjoyed the Museum but there is a bit too much information on display for my Wife. Obviously the Staff loves the subject. I enjoyed it mostly.
96,Needed more time!,"Between the videos, the masks and masquerades as well as the musical instruments one has much to enjoy. I understand the exhibition is up until September so catch it when you're in Phoenix."
97,A must do when in Phoenix,Plan to spend at least two hours here.  Loved the exhibits and memorabilia.  You get a headset that allows you to hear music as you stand at each display.  Food at the cafeteria was good as well.  Check their calendar of concerts before you go.
98,Great and unexpected Gem in Arizona,"This is fascinating, even for non-musicians. The history of instrument development from all over the world is organized in an easy to follow and and interesting way that makes sense and is totally enjoyable."
99,Australian visitors,Incredible collection of instruments set in seven continents.   Informative videos and entertains music presented for each collection of instruments.   Staff is pleasant and helpful.   Cafe is full menu and presented with style.
100,Visit for Mom,This is one of the best venues and they have terrific artists visit.  I’ve seen numerous concerts and all have been excellent. No bad seats either.  Jim Brickman and David Benoit both played in December and were outstanding.
101,Fun day at the museum!,We loved the museum and were amazed at the variety of instruments and the number of instruments and the fact that they had some from just about every country in the world. And the videos were great and really gave you a taste of each country’s music. Very neat place. Don’t miss it if you like music and like museums.
102,Amazing place- must for music lovers!,"This was my favorite museum in recent memory.  It was organized very thoughtfully and had a very convenient headphone system which activated for the music at each different station automatically, so you could hear what was playing on the visual displays while looking at examples of the instruments of hundreds of different cultures and countries, arranged by continent.  It also had a great hands-on area where children (and grandparents) could try their hands at all sorts of exotic instruments including gongs, harps and every type of drum.  I enjoyed the great area with musical instruments previously owned by famous musicians such as Elvis, Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, etc.  Our only regret was that we had to leave early to catch a plane that day."
103,"Wonderful museum, full of surprises, including videos of friends of ours",If you love music you must visit this museum. Unbelievable display of instruments from around the world with plenty of interactive displays. Two day pass would allow you plenty of time to explore this large museum.
104,Fascinating,We had musician friends visiting from Chicago and we decided to visit the MIM. We received headphones which plays information from each exhibit and we were very interested to learn about musical instruments from around the world as well as famous artists. There were instruments available to play and it was interesting to have the musicians play instruments they were not familiar with and enjoy. Lots of fun and entertainment!
105,World Class Musical Museum,The MIM is an unbelievable experience with instruments from all over the world.  One can easily spend hours in the museum exploring all of the facets.  They do have food on-site although there are great restaurants all around as well.
106,Great Place for a Concert,"Be prepared to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of exhibits. You will find a physical and video exhibit for almost every country in the world. They are divided into geographical regions, e.g., Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Europe, U.S., and more. If your time is limited, pick 2 or 3 of the ones you are most interested in. If you're not alone, pick a time and place to meet up, because it's likely you'll be moving along in different places at different paces."
107,One of the best museums worldwide,"Spent 3 hours at this amazing museum and could go again and again.  So much to see and hear, and it’s beautifully executed.  The building itself is also inspirational and reminded me of other stunning museums around the globe.      Just go!"
108,Wow Wow Wow!!,"I think every instrument ever known to man is on exhibit here.  It is well organized, well planned out and meticulously documented.  So much so that it can be overwhelming. If you are a musician or a music scholar this will be heaven.  It is hard to take in in one visit."
109,Interesting - Interactive - Special Showings - Intimate Concerts,What an amazing music museum. Loved the fact that the exhibits were so interactive based upon the headset that you were wearing. Great to see the music from around the world represented. Music does bring everyone together. You might think since this is self guided there is no one there to assist you - LOL - there is someone around every corner there to answer a question or direct you. Be sure to take a moment to go into the “touch” part of the museum where you can play an instrument - or try as in my case. It was great! A definite must when in Phoenix!
110,Not your typical museum!,What a wonderful way to spend hours upon hours looking at the music culture of many different countries. They also have a small then you four musical performances that is very intimate with the performers.
111,Best museum experience in years!,"A wonderful place to visit!  A collection of musical instruments around the world organized by continent and country. Most all include a TV with a collection of video clips hearing and seeing the instruments in use!  You have headphones which sync to the TV display you are standing in front of. Tips: 1) Wear comfortable shoes. You are on your feet the whole time of your visit, 2) unless you have all day you might want to not watch every video of the first room you enter or you won’t have time to make it to evert room. We watched every video in the first room and then shorted the other rooms. 3) Eat lunch in the lunchroom! They have a number of wonderful high quality choices!"
112,I would grant six stars if I could. A museum experience like no other. Don't miss it.,"We had a rainy afternoon in Phoenix and decided to visit this museum - so glad we did - it has an ambitious remit to pull together musical instruments across the ages and across the globe, but it probably succeeds 🤔, certainly more than any competitor museum - it’s maybe a bit top heavy on African culture and dance rituals but I get the impression that the collection will be expanded / refined in the coming years to address the balance...There are great highlights including rock n roll hero memorabilia (Jonny Cash, Elvis Presley, Glen Campbell to name a few) but also some historical items such as the pianola and Nickelodeon and at noon and 3pm daily, a fabulous demonstration of a huge orchestrion, which is almost a century old! The only niggle I had was, as a Scot, very simplistic “bagpipes and fiddle” display - think there could be a bit more research into some of displays and not just relying on stereotypes, but I think that some of these displays are “starters for ten” and will be built upon 👍"
113,Fantastic museum!,"Wow - what they have done is phenomenal. A journey through the WORLD by music. Instruments for almost every country, with videos for almost all (you get headphones with your ticket), including some with the exact instruments on display. We spent all day, going in around opening time, taking a long break for lunch, and going back in the afternoon and we couldn't get through it all. Had to rush through the US section. There's a hand's on section where you can play some instruments - was pretty fun. I am not a heavy follower of any music style or any particular bands and this was intriguing, educational, beautiful, historical and just plain fun. Also did the special African Mask exhibition, which was quite interesting and well done, but if you're only going to be here one day (they do have 2-day tickets), I'd skip that and focus on the rest. Plenty of parking."
114,top location,A one of a kind museum. Wonderful  displays of thousands of instruments from all over the world. A great self guided audio tour so you can listen to the music of the instruments and the music native to there country. Also a great cafe for a snack or meal.
115,"WOW, What a pleasant surprise ",Our recent  self guided tour of the museum was fantastic. We started at the special Congo exhibit enjoying the unusual masks and costumes along with the music and video clips. The artists room featured all genres with exemplary performers. We had fun in the exploratory room. On the second floor we saw musical instruments and clips of performances from around the world.
116,"Great Museum,","Very unique. We spent 3 1/2 hours there and didn't even see half of the museum. Divided up by areas of the world and then countries. Also has an experience room where you can try out instruments. And the artists room, where you can see old performers and their instruments is a must see. Highly recommend."
117,More fantastic than expected! ,"This is a world class museum and a great way to spend a day in Phoenix.  I didn't know what to expect, but the interactive exhibits were spectacular.  I was a little disappointed in the attitude of one of the helpers who assumed that it was her place to tell me what I should like, but not enough to let it spoil my fun.   There's something here for everyone who loves beautiful noise."
118,What fun!,You can actually hear the instruments by listening with their audio devices at monitors throughout the halls.  Can be overwhelming.  Wish there were some more variety with the instruments shown--but I expect that to change over time as they are a fairly new museum.
119,Not to be missed!,Fantastic trip through music history.  The amount of history is amazing. The instruments On display are one of the finest collections. Plan to spend a few hours.
120,A Must See Mussum!,This is a World Class experience!  It is worth an entire day.  See it all and get the two day pass because you can't see and understand it all in one day.The actual instruments combined with the AV expereience is very special.  GO and STAY a long time
121,Great small concert venue!,This Museum was the HIGHLIGHT of my entire 18 day bus tour to Arizona and Southern California! The tour was very good but upon going back to several exhibits on my own was a treat! The exhibits were nicely laid out and with the individual earphones you could access any exhibit without bothering anyone else. I could have used a week in here!
122,Educational and entertaining,"This place is a must see in the Phoenix area. People of all ages will find this place wonderful. Our granddaughter enjoyed the music room, were you can play a great number of instruments."
123,Lucky To Hear About This,"My friend and I had a wonderful day at the Musical Instrument Museum. We started in Africa which had a myriad of different exhibits.  Loved the Beduin & Israel exhibits very much. Also saw si many variation of the same instruments. For instance, cymbals, the Ud, & some costumes too.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The food was delicious and sitting outside was so relaxing."
124,Amazing for musicians or not,"Don’t miss MIM if you are in the area.  Allow all day to wander through the museum learning about the instruments of different countries.  Fascinating place, well done exhibits and helpful staff.  Plenty of parking."
125,Kids love the MIM,It's an amazing museum. Something you would see in NYC. I couldn't believe that this museum it a hidden treasure in AZ. So glad we found it. Will definitely go again.
126,Pleasant surprise in Scottsdale ,Spring training was cancelled along with rain everyday.  So we looked for inside things to do and found the Musicl Instrument Museum.  What an amazing place to easily spend the whole day viewing the different instruments used by different countries and cultures.  Very informative presentations that are on the player and headphones you wear while touring.
127,All the musical instruments from all over the globe! WOW!,"My husband & I went to see a Mariachi concert in December. The venue is wonderful - small & intimate. The sound is great, parking is so easy. It’s such a pleasure to go to concerts here."
128,Don’t miss this gem! Wear comfortable shoes!,This was my 4th visit with my mom who is 84. She loves music so it’s perfect for her. They even have an adaption for her cochlear implant. Lots of benches to rest on and a snack bar. No discount for seniors.
129,a beautiful museum!,"The MIM is a super museum, but it is also the home to a super small concert venue.    The acoustics are perfect and there is not a bad seat anywhere.   They are constantly bringing in an eclectic group of musicians, so you have to keep checking the calendar to see who will be there."
130,Wonderful Collection ,"The collections are well designed and arranged.  From the moment you walk in you are transported into a musician’s paradise.  The history and development is available for whatever instrument you play or are interested in.  I especially enjoyed the display of player piano and organ.  There are also exhibits by every region of the world.  You will see the history of music throughout Africa, Asia, South America.  The display for USA was spectacular.   But we ran out of time.  If you are a musician or looking to inspire your young musician, you can’t miss this museum. If time permits, go for two days.  It is well worth the time.  It is also very affordable.   I just loved it!"
131,A highlight,A must stop in Phoenix is the Musical Instrument Museum. What a treasure. Musical instruments and traditions from throughout the world. Entertaining and educational in a beautiful facility. You can take a brief guided tour or a self guided tour with head phones. We spent nearly 3 1/2 hours and only stopped because our ears got a bit sore from wearing the headphones.We ended our tour by going through the final exhibit where you can actually play many of the instruments.This is really a place for all ages as was evident by all the school kids and families in the museum. And lastly this museum is well worth the price of admission.
132,Way more interesting that you might think,The MIM is rated as the top tourist event in the Phoenix area and it’s easy to understand why. You’ll receive a pair of ear phones and as you walk from one exhibit to the next you will hear the instruments of that country. There is a special exhibit this year on Congolese masks and instruments. But the absolute best is to attend a concert in the gem of a theatre with 299 seats and every seat is surrounded by delicious sound! Don’t miss it. There is a concert almost every evening .
133,One of a kind museum,Totally surprised by the MIM. As you enter you are given a set of headphones to use and when you enter the space where various notable musicians are displayed the video starts right up - no glitches - host excellence. There's a room next door that allows the guests to play various instruments. Get ready to spend 3-4 hours there. Music is the language of the soul.
134,My Experience/Practical Logistics,"This musical instrument museum was unbelievable. I was so impressed by the number of countries, cultures and sub cultures from which the museum gathered music and history. They amassed so much that it took a few trips to really go through all the regions of the world. Another surprise for me was the fact that they have a concert venue of many different genres of music. Tickets may be purchased just like one would purchase them for a concert. I recommend it to everyone looking for new and local experiences."
135,A Must See,Fascinating tour well organized by country and historical development. A bit over whelming as you can't take it all in in a day. Beautiful building.
136,A Must See If you are a Music or Art Lover!,Plan to spend a few hours here. So much to see and learn. A music lovers dream. Great deal for the price.
137,This museum is a MUST for every music lover and basically for everyone over the age of 14 or so,We missed this special place for several years as the thought of this specialty museum did not appeal. How wrong was this! Ended up with two full days and still 1/3 to explore. The video clips of all the instuments and performers number over 1200. Every internationally known group and solo star has a concert video selection. Incredible history of every musical genre from origin to current performance use. Beautiful grounds and in house food and drinks to rest between visual and audio stimulation. Head sets pick up show at every display. Best ever!
138,Why didn't I do this before!,"From the historical perspective of music around the world to current music this place has something for everyone! Don't miss the hands on exhibit- The Experience Gallery, where you can try different instruments, great for kids and adults alike!"
139,Amazing Museum,I was impressed with the visiting guests and all the fun displays! My friend wanted to go but I was a little apprehensive. To my surprise I was very impressed with this wonderful museum and I am so happy we went.
140,Totally fabulous!,"Looking for something different to do on our annual visit to AZ.  This was a really cool stop.  Can go through in a couple hours, learn something and have fun."
141,WOW - What A Visit!,"Musical instruments from all over the world are exhibited along with audio examples that magically appear in the headsets you are wearing.  The instruments on the upper floor are grouped by their location in the world. Downstairs,  at the entrance level, there are two large rooms,  with one devoted to displaying instruments of famous musicians from every kind of music.  You could easily spend two full days here. Finally,  if you ever wondered what it would be like to play a model B Steinway grand piano in a large open space, there's one sitting just past the entrance waiting for you to try."
142,MIM....Musical Instrument Museum,This beautiful museum showcases an amazing display of gorgeous musical instruments from around the world and through the centuries. they also offer a comprehensive collection of video clips.
143,fabulous!,"We had been told that this museum shouldn’t be missed although I don’t have any musical talent and couldn’t see how instruments would interest me. How wrong was I, this is without doubt one of the most interesting museums I have ever visited and I am a museum freak. The collection covers traditional musical types in almost every country, each exhibit has a TV set playing which automatically connects to your free headphones. The music plays for each segment showing how the instruments sound and giving examples of local music styles. Downstairs you will find an exhibit hall of famous artists including Elvis Presley, Sting , Marley and many more. This is a not to be missed visit."
144,Lots of great instruments ,"We spent several hours here, first visiting the Latin America section of the Ethnomusicology exhibits. Organized by country, each exhibit has a display of instruments and sometimes clothing, along with videos and musical clips. The audio provided with the entrance fee automatically plays the music once the wearer is in proximity--no need to enter numbers or letters or start or stop. An excellent system! After a couple of hours there, we stopped for lunch at the Cafe Allegro on the first floor. Review later.Then to the Artists' Gallery with displays of individual artists or groups--Toy Orbison, Kronos Quartet. Highly recommended. Then a visit to the mechanical room--automatons, player pianos and an enormous player organ from the Netherlands with button accordions  drums etc, all now controlled by computer rather than punched player scrolls. Fabulous museum and we didn't see it all."
145,A music lover's dream,"This museum is a rare find.  Museums get a bad rap for being boring.  Not this one.  What a cool place.  So much fun and informative.  We spent half a day and didn’t see it all, but had a fabulous time.  Great for kids, too.  Suggestion for adults during school year - get there later in the morning, close to noon, and the school trips will be over and gone.  Great to see those kids here, but the noise can be an issue."
146,"Huge, Excellent, and Unique","At the front desk, there is a menu option to purchase a two-day ticket.  We all thought that was a big joke until we had spent a few hours covering a tiny piece of this amazing museum.  You are given a headset to begin your journey through the world of music--and I mean that literally.  Each 'stop' is a country, or for some of the bigger nations, a region, with samples of musical instruments, costumes and cultural items.  When you stand in front of the display, a large screen displays the video for that nation or region.  It happens automatically and is a feast for you ears and your eyes.  And it never ends!  Room after room after room.  One of the docents said that the current display is only a fraction of the whole  collection.  There is also a room where you can try all sort of drums, harps, and even a Theramin! Do not miss this museum.  Better yet, make a trip to Phoenix to see this place and buy the two day ticket.  As an aside, they have a great coffee shop and an even cooler gift shop."
147,Outstanding...A Must See,"A fun place. You get taken back in time, watching all your favorite bands in the N. America section.  There are more countries to explore too. I would give a least 3 hours maybe 4."
148,Worth several hours,We went to this museum on a Sunday afternoon and expected to the museum to be crowded due the number of cars in the parking lot but the museum was not crowded or congested anywhere. The number of instruments from all over the world was extensive and informative. I like the guided self tour with a personal hearing device so we could hear all of the sounds. It was the perfect size and number of rooms and exhibits to see in an afternoon.
149,World class,I've been to this museum many times.  It is a great place to take visitors in town.   There are live concerts that are great to attend.
150,Too short,"We anticipated staying 2 hours maximum... and left after 5 hours with more yet to see!  It was fabulous from the museum layout, the histories provided, the  maps highlighting the specific area of the music /instruments, the audio presentations of the local music, and the numerous instruments displayed per country/cultures. It was one of the best museums we have seen; it clearly showed that music indeed is the universal language of all people and part of all people.  The details of instrument making was incredible...such talent and craftsmanship.  So much to absorb and fully remember.  The cafe also offered great foods and was a delightful break. The gift shop was fun with quality items representative of all aspects of the museum.   A must to see and enjoy!"
151,Amazing,I really enjoyed my visit here. I would say it is a world tour with music. Just about every nation on earth has a small section showing instruments from that region. Many have short video clips showing local music being performed. Take your time and enjoy. I also had an excellent lunch at the cafe. If I lived in the area I would definitely purchase a membership.
152,Enjoyable time at the Musical Instrument Museum,"Can't believe I had not heard of this place before. Beautiful, well designed building. The self guiding tour was exceptional, letting you hear the music of the countries and people shown in the displays. I've never seen so many instruments from so many different places. Lots of notable musicians featured too. Much better than the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Very good cafeteria fr lunch, helpful docents. Plan at least half a day, but you could spend a couple of days."
153,We did a group tour,"The Musical Instrument Museum was a pleasant surprise and well worth the visit. We spent 3 hours browsing the exhibits reflecting instruments from around the world. For each country, divided by continent/region, there were instruments, often costumes of musicians, and film clips showing the instruments in action, often with singing and dancing. Saw everything from Elvis' guitars and outfits to artefacts from the most remote regions. Photos show the orchestrion (several instruments in one giant mechanism), guitars from South Africa made from old cans, and 2 very different versions of a xylophone. Fascinating!"
154,Amazingly fun and informative!,"There is so much to see at this wonderful museum, with musical instruments from all around the world and performances shown on TV screens that show those instruments being played.  I've been to many museums which provide you with a headset (often charging extra for it), and then I've had to enter a code each time I approached a display for which there was narration available.  At this museum, all one needs to do is approach a display and the audio track automatically starts playing through the headset.  This made for a splendid museum experience, one that is certainly one of the best I've ever had.  We spend about four hours at the museum, and I could have easily spent four more.  Highly recommended!"
155,We stayed till closing time!,"Musical Instruments from around the world, showing the commonality of music everywhere. Excellent concert venue as well"
156,Exceptional,"We received a gift certificate a year ago and just did not get around to going out to the museum.  What a mistake.  We finally went last weekend, what a fun day!  The museum set up is outstanding.  The displays are all set up so you can get a small audio presentation about the artist or the instrument on the headsets you receive when you pay for admission. No nickel and diming you on the cost of the headphones, they come with the admission.  What a great place.  If you come to Arizona and you are over 12, you will enjoy this museum.  Younger children may enjoy the museum, but it is so large, a younger child will not hold up long enough to get through the entire place.  I could barely get through it and that was only after I took a break at the cafeteria.  Just a fantastic museum."
157,Jim Brickman Concert,We really liked the museum and felt it was a worthwhile visit.  My family relocated to Phoenix over 20 years ago and we visit often.  This would not be first on our list to visit but if you love music and instruments then this is a good place to go to.
158,Great place with interactive displays.,Fantastic museum... so much information and so many items to see.... impossible to do it justice in one trip....
159,Concert,"This is one of THE best museums I have ever visited.  The facility itself is beautiful and very well laid out.  There are many exhibits that cover music from around the world for a wide period of time.  With the self guided tour you can spend as much or as little time as you want at each exhibit.  The Experience Gallery where you can play many instruments was particularly fun.  We arrived shortly after it opened, so there were few visitors providing ample opportunity to play on the instruments.  the staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiast.  The one negative its the MIM does not receive enough publicity.  I heard about it from word of month and did not see it on Trip Advisor as a top destination until my return home."
160,An unexpected treasure and one of the best attractions in Phoenix,"My husband and I were absolutely blown away by the amount of things to see, hear, and experience in this museum. They have instruments from quite literally around the world, with large areas dedicated to each continent and sub-sections for each country/area. I saw so many instruments I had never heard of before. There are also instruments and items from popular musicians from around the world. Give yourself ample time to explore. We ended up skipping Oceania due to running out of steam. Don't miss the Experience Gallery, where you can touch and play some very unique instruments for yourself!"
161,Musuem of Music,"My husband and I were absolutely blown away by the amount of things to see, hear, and experience in this museum. They have instruments from quite literally around the world, with large areas dedicated to each continent and sub-sections for each country/area. I saw so many instruments I had never heard of before. There are also instruments and items from popular musicians from around the world. Give yourself ample time to explore. We ended up skipping Oceania due to running out of steam. Don't miss the Experience Gallery, where you can touch and play some very unique instruments for yourself!"
162,The entire experience rocks.,"By seeing the collection of musical instruments, visitors can also see pop music legends' instruments, classical music instruments, and the history of all music instruments!"
163,The MIM is a must see for anyone who loves music,"There's just too much to see here. Pace yourself. Avoid any special exhibits, time is better spent on the main ones. The one hour orientation tour was good in giving a sense of what all there is. Don't miss the sound machine demos at noon or 3pm. Cafe is decent."
164,Lots to see,"Great seeing all the different instruments fro all the countries (so many they blurred together). The show stealer was the room on main floor that allowed hands on to play many, many different instruments- drums, banjos, xylophones, etc. FUN!"
165,"Huge collection of musical instruments, old and new. Amazing!",The MIM is a spectacular display of music offering world culture as well as musical instruments from around the globe.  The theatre is intimate with a amazing acoustics and featuring many different genres of musical talent through the artists.
166,Great indoor activity ,My cousin both a musician and a world traveler BUT not a museum person so he wasn’t really interested in going.  BUT he went and LOVED it and wish he could have spent a second day there!   Plan to be there as long as you possibly can!  It’s wonderful.......and reasonably priced for quality!  Good for all ages!
167,A Must See for music lovers!,"We were on a guided tour. This guide knew his stuff! ! He had degrees in music. I liked this museum because it studied music from the beginning of time.   Also, from different parts of the world!    It was so interesting!  We saw little kids were also enjoying the hands on parts of each station. We have a fabulous music museum here in Seattle so my husband was not enthused about going. But did as a courtesy  to me.  However he really liked it!  So different from Seattle’s MoPOP.!  The guide was giving interesting  facts. He asked if anyone knew ...  my husband did know!  Ron  was hooked!"
168,A Special Place.,"We attended a jazz concert featuring the Rebirth Brass Band from New Orleans. Thanks to the concert hall having the best acoustics in USA, we could clearly hear the lyrics sung over the brass instruments music. Hats off to the tuba player! We love this theatre and the museum. It feels the “right” thing to do to be part of the MIM’s program.The cafe serves great home style lunches and there’s a bar for pre concert drinks. The donated Steinway pianos in the foyers are very anyone to play"
169,Fantastic museum - really worth a visit ,The 4 of us who visited found this very interesting.  The similarities of how musical instruments developed across different cultures was striking.  well worth the time to visit.
170,Heart-stopping!  I was in heaven for over 5 hours and need to return to enjoy the European section as well.,"MIM is well worth the trip!  Be prepared to spend several hours.   We also attended a lovely concert of Hawaiian music in the evening after our visit, so I recommend not only the museum, but also checking out what music is scheduled for MIM’s concert hall."
171,Strings and Horns,"I am not musically inclined but even I found it so interesting.  You put on a speaker (don’t know the proper word for it) around your neck and as you approach an instrument the speaker plays the instruments music (you adjust the volume).  It is divided up by countries, instruments, artists.  Could of spent most of day there.  Thousands of instruments."
172,Interesting and enjoyable to a non-musican,very big museum with lots of famous instruments from all over the world - like to play a real steinway or see the backline of maroon 5 or the guitar of Aldi Meola  go there
173,Wonderful ,Definitely worth a visit if you have time. This Museum has every single instrument from all parts of the world!
174,"Amazing place, spent 6 hours","My husband and I went to the MIM expecting to only stay 2-3 hours.  Neither of us are musically inclined.  What a surprise!  We could have stayed all day!  AS we entered we were given headsets.  At each exhibit, there were videos of music in that country or area of the world.  We could hear it when we were in front of the screen."
175,Music lovers Day of History,"We went on a Sunday afternoon upon the suggestion of a co-worker. I wish we’d started in the morning so we’d have more time. Upon entering, you are provided with headphones and as you approach the various exhibits, a short video(s) starts with music and performances. There are so many instruments from cultures around the world. It was a great geography lesson as well! Some areas were not open due to COVID, but there was plenty to see still. There is a performing arts center and restaurant as well."
176,Must see museum,"This is an awe-inspiring collection, not to be missed. It makes me happy to be a human being. In this world of strife and differences,our  beauty-seeking commonality is demonstrated throughout this museum. I couldn't get enough of it. It's a spacious, well- curated collection with many educational programs available to all ages."
177,Worth a visit,"My bother and I with our wives spent most of the day exploring the MIM, the musical instrument museum.   Its many galleries with one 'hands on' gallery where you can play any of the instruments on display.It is truly worth the effort to come and spend the day.  It is wheelchair and children friendly."
178,Great museum,We had the opportunity to attend a Christmas party at the MIM and it was fabulous! The museum itself is very impressive and the servers and food were fantastic!
179,Definitely Worth The Visit,The two 11 year old boys were entertained for about 2 hours then they wanted to play on the instruments. I could have spent all day there.
180,Go to this!,"Really should be titled The Museum of Ethnomusicology, because it is so much more than a collection of instruments. Videos showing multiple snippets of music from every corner of the world. We spent 5 1/2 hours there and didn't see/hear it all."
181,"Amazing, better than I expected","Not only can you see this extraordinary collection of instruments, but you can hear them played through the headphones issued as you enter. (Not all - but many can be heard.) We had only dedicated about two hours for our visit -- I wish we had had a whole day. It was way more interesting than I had anticipated."
182,Do not miss this attraction!,"This lovely building houses what could have been an interesting but dry collection of the musical instruments of the world.  However, with the video clips and the opportunity to listen to music clips the collection comes to life.Music of the world made on the most amazing, diverse collection of instruments, culture, geography and anthropology are all presented in such an entertaining way, you hardly notice you are being educated!Very little is in a glass case so you view most exhibits without barriers but please respect them;  a woman hit a drum three times whilst we were there.There is also the opportunity to make music yourself including a Steinway piano which anyone can play including a two year old who was playing it with his elbows!Volunteers are helpful and friendly and there are lovely views.  We only allowed one day and we could easily have visited twice but then we love music and museums!"
183,Fantastic,Every concert I've seen here was amazing. I've seen individual performers as well as groups and they were all great.
184,Not just for musicians,"Over 5000 instruments from around the world on display.  Videos everywhere - see how Martin makes guitars; how Steinway makes pianos.  Instruments from every country in the world with samples of ethnic music.  Listen to the orchestrion play at Noon or 3 PM.  So much to see, it's no wonder they have both a 1 day and 2 day pass.The only time you know you've been there a while is when your back starts to hurt.  That's when to stop at the upscale cafeteria for some good food in a pleasant outdoor setting.  Don't miss this - on a scale of `1 to 5, it should be a 7."
185,Musical instrument Museum,"Nicely laid out by country, types of music, instruments, etc. I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. Also, curious by a few artists left out, but it would take a lot of space to capture them all. Really need 2 days to see it all. We pooped out before we finished.  Worth seeing though!"
186,Loved It !,This covered the entire history of world music! I need to go back to see parts that I did not have tie for
187,World  Class  Collection  of  Musical  Instruments,The MIM is in my opinion one of the top places to visit in the Phoenix area.  The place is huge and to appreciate all that is there you should plan to spend at least four hours exploring all that there is to see.  This is one of the best museums in the world and has so much to offer.  It is interactive and you will learn so much if you take some time to read and listen to the music from all corners of the world.  This is a great place for people of all ages.
188,Amazing collection!,"The name may not make it sound all that interesting but this museum is a wonder that anyone who enjoys music of any kind will certainly enjoy. Part of the collection is presented in large galleries devoted to the musical traditions of world regions, which allows for thematic comparisons and contrasts. Another gallery is organized by types of music and famous personalities for each one. The displays include a combination of instruments, information, and media in just the right length to be informative but not overwhelming, and the variety from one to the next makes each one a fresh experience. Each gallery can take several hours to appreciate fully so the museum is worth more than a short visit, and the restaurant has absolutely delicious meals and snacks that will keep everyone energized. That staff members, both professional and volunteer, are friendly and approachable, and the portable recorded guides are easy to use. A program of lecture presentations and performances looked very interesting, and while the timing of this visit didn't allow for attending any of them I'm sure we'll be back again for another visit."
189,One of the best museum experiences I've ever had!,Very extensive collection of instruments from around the world.  You can spend a lot of time as the place is very large.  Definitely worth a trip. We used the headsets to guide the tour.
190,One of the best museums ever!,"Amazing tour through the cultural souls of countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and the US. Videos and texts were amazing! Worth spending the whole day!"
191,If you like music or if your a musicians I highly recommend coming to this museum,"We always bring our AZ visitors to the MIM.  It has been a wonderful surprise all have enjoyed.  When you approach an exhibit, the audio device turns on to play the associated music.  We even had our baby grandson share the headphones with me and he radiated such happiness when each piece of music started.  So, great for all ages.  The hardest thing is to get through it all in a reasonable amount of time.  Additionally, the MIM is always a fun venue for concerts for small audiences.  The acoustics are great in all seats, as is the visibility.  We have been to a dozen performances and have loved every one of them, including Judy Collins, Lisa Fischer, Monsieur Perine, Laurel Canyon w/Khani Cole and other AZ artists, David Grisman, et al .  The performers have all put on great shows and we plan to attend many more concerts at the MIM."
192,Musical Tour,"Reluctantly accompanied our daughter with her family, but turned out to be one of the highlights of our month in Arizona ! Excellent ."
193,Music lovers,"We visited the Museum while in town visiting a friend. Don't pass up the headphones - they really make the visit comprehensive as there is a video with sound at just about every display. The array of musical instruments is really amazing, and they are organized geographically which makes for an interesting trip around the musical world. Highly recommend, especially for musicians."
194,fascinating place,I'm musically challenged and thoroughly enjoyed the seeing and hearing the instruments from around the world though the generations.  We expected to spend 2-3 hours and ended up staying until closing 7 hours after we arrived. The best part is privately listening to the instruments on the headsets and watching them being played on the tv in each exhibit.  Don't miss the 1st floor exhibits where you can see modern musicians and also the room with instruments that you can play yourself.
195,"Musical instruments not my usual thing, what an experience!","Found this place on TripAdvisor while looking for something to do before a late afternoon flight.  We have been to smaller musical instrument museums in Michigan and Germany, but neither compared to the size of this one.  Very interesting place to learn about old instruments, instruments from around the world, and memorabilia from famous artists.  Spent a couple of hours and wishing we had a couple more.  Worth seeing!"
196,Even if you don't like music but love museums...,"Wow! I knew going into this I would enjoy it because I’m a musician. My wife, who isn’t, accommodated me to the MIM. She was the one who didn’t want to leave! We looked at our watch and three hours had gone by! It was amazingly curated and the layout of the museum was phenomenal. We would highly recommend it!"
197,Must See Museum,MIM is not only educational it is also very entertaining. Every time I have gone there I  find something that I didn't see the previous visit.
198,Fun and instructional experience,"Who knew musical instruments could be so interesting.  We were there 3 hours, and it was not long enough.  Could easily be there a whole day if you take the time to listen to and read about each exhibit, otherwise, be selective and visit the areas you find most interesting first, or move quickly through the museum, as there is much to see.  It is interactive, entertaining and educational. It may stir some memories of songs or music lessons when you were young, or favorite musical artists, past and present.  Learn about musical instruments and their sounds from all around the world."
199,"A must, top place to visit in Phoenix","OMG...PHENOMENAL museum! We arrived at 11am to take the orientation tour which was a great way to get an overview of the museum with a knowledgable guide before exploring on our own.  The depth and breadth of the instruments, artifacts & traditional clothing from every corner of the world coupled with performance videos from every country were fascinating.  We spent the entire day there until closing at 5pm.  The only downside was that we didn't have enough time to see everything so wound up rushing through the last two galleries.  In hindsight, we definitely should have come at 9am when the museum opened!  It is literally that interesting that you need the entire day there! However, no matter how much time you have to spend, this museum is a must-see. The special exhibit (additional fee) about electric guitars was very interesting and well worth seeing.  The experience gallery was so cool and so much fun!  We all had a great time playing different instruments from around the world.  The food at the cafe, though pricey, was delicious!  If only we lived in Phoenix (or if they had a museum like this in NYC!), we'd be regulars for sure!"
200,There is only one!  It IS a global experience.,This is a true treasure!  We have been several times and keep going back.  There is not enough time in a day to see everything.  We have taken children as young as five to see it and everyone finds something of interest to absorb them.
201,Invited a house guest to see MIM.,"We've attended four concerts in the past year here. There is no bad seat in the best-in-class acoustic concert hall at the MIM. Whatever your musical taste, MIM theater will become your favorite place to listen and SEE musical talent.  The intimacy of this music hall makes you feel as if the artist is performing just for you! The interaction between the audience and performers are genuine. Never a disappointment!"
202,Incredible museum,"We attended a concert here and really loved it, great acoustics.  We decided to go back and tour the museum and it was awesome!  So much there to see, well worth the $20 admission price."
203,A Must For Music Lovers,We visited as a family as my husband is a musician. This was always going to be more his bag than our but we all managed to find something we enjoyed during the day. Luckily our visit coincided with a polynesian event so were lucky to watch some traditional dancing which was very unique. We also took part in some craft activities to make uli ulis - which was a great way for our little boy to spend a bit of quiet time. The hands on musical instrument room was great but always quite noisy as you would expect. My husband really enjoyed the visit but overall it was little bit more challenging for me to keep our little boy amused. I think maybe when we he is a little bit older he will get more from the experience.
204,Not a Musician but Still Found it Amazing,What an absolute delight. Music and instruments from around the world. Even had a small display from secretive North Korea.
205,Surprised,"The Musical Instrument Museum is one of the best kept secrets in America.  There is so much to see and do -- you could literally spend a day there looking, browsing, listening, and playing.  Our future daughter-in-law recommended it -- she nailed it.  I personally think this is a MUST visit for anybody visiting (or even living in) the Phoenix area.  Spectacular - well done!"
206,World class music museum!,"This was much more than we expected. We were there when it opened. Toured most of the first floor. Went to the  excellent included concert, had lunch, then started the second floor. We were only able to see half of it before we wore out. We highly recommend this museum. You see, hear, touch and get to even try out many instruments."
207,A Supririnsg Gem of Museum,"We have visited this museum twice and each time we had to leave without seeing everything we would have liked to see.  If you want to cover the entire museum you should plan on a really full day or spread it over two days.  There are so many different instruments and types of music that we had never even heard of. It is very, very interesting."
208,Trip Around the World,We were most pleasantly surprised. Lots interesting exhibits to see and things to do while keeping cool on a hot day.
209,Amazing Musical Experience!,"One of a kind!  Not to be missed! An immersive experience, easy to do, and fun.  The restaurant serves great ethnic foods as well as usual favorites."
210,So much more than instruments.,We enjoyed seeing all the different musical instruments from around the world. Could return and still see more and do more.
211,Such an interesting museum,"This was quite fun. It establishes itself as a way to share music from around the world and does so. The tour comes with headphones that sync up with a million monitors so you can hear the instruments. I could have stayed longer - we were quite overwhelmed. My daughter was shocked at how large the world truly is.My son (6th grade) seemed the perfect age to soak it all in. Both kids loved the hands on gallery, which is a small but essential part.We really had an incredible, only her experience. Must do if visiting Phoenix."
212,The best museum I have been to,"Visiting Phoenix after many years means finding many new aspects to explore. Soooo glad for our first venture we chose MIM. What a great museum of musical instruments from the smallest countries and villages from around the world.wear the ear phones to get full effect of the music from those instruments. The displays also will include costumes in a lot of instances. Exhibits are arranged by regions as well,so it is easy to follow. Highly recommend this.please allow at least 2hrs.+. There is also a small cafe in the courtyard...our time did not. pan out for lunch. Make this a must .You need not be a music buff."
213,Was skeptical but. It now,I went to see The Fixx here in August 2019 and it was smaller than I thought which made the concert even better!
214,November visit,"Plan to spend a day there, well worth it.  Not only will you hear great music but you will learn about the world."
215,Amazing Experience!,"This is an awesome experience, enjoyable by pretty much everyone. It's so much more than just musical instruments - it's also dance and costumes and foreign cultures. You see how music is intertwined with people's lives regardless of the continent they live on. The exhibition style is state-of-the-art excellent with a jillion videos that let you see and hear the instruments being played and its impact on the musicians, the other participants, the audiences. This is not what you'd think of when you hear ""museum"" with items in glass cases. This is a place where you can spend hours at a time (we were there 4 hours and the time flew by) and realize you just scratched the surface."
216,Wonderful  museum,"This is definitely one of the best museums we have been to.  I wish we would have started in the North American wing because we ended up spending most of our time there and did not finish everything before they closed.  Tremendous number of instruments and music covering the whole globe.  Even people who do not normally like museums will like this one.  If visiting the Phoenix area, this should be at the top of your must do list."
217,Even more amazing than expected!,"A beautiful music tribute to past artists, as well as showcasing instruments from all over the world, from past to present. The layout is well done, first class presentation. We spent almost the entire day there, and didn’t get to all of it. We want to go back!! Definitely a must see!"
218,"AMAZING, STUNNING, CAPTIVATING",This is one of the Top Destination Spots in the greater Phoenix area for anyone of any age who lives in or visits Phoenix area. Very educational as well as entertaining.
219,I loved MIM and want to be there from open to close next time I go!,"If you are at all interested in music, this is the place for you! It's an incredible collection of instruments and videos from all over the world. I'm so glad we bought a two-day pass. Even with two days, we still didn't see everything. I would recommend checking the calendar of events for concerts; some are included in the ticket price."
220,We had 2 hours but needed 2 days!,"Going to the MIM is always a great experience. The venue is better than any Vegas venue. I love the intimacy it has to offer. As Jim Brickman stated ""it's like being at a party at someone's home.""The concert was a bit disappointing for me.  I felt there was too much Christmas music and not enough of Jim's other musical pieces played.That being said, I will definitely continue to the MIM any chance I get."
221,Lovely museum ,This place is a must see if you are a musician and even if you’re not it still amazing to visit! A great collection of musical instruments from around the world
222,Rainy day visit,I love this place! Great to check out! Plan on spending a long time there! Grab some food in the cafe! It’s good
223,Fabulous treasure in the desert,"My wife has dragged me literally around the world visiting museums. Now I like art and design probably more than the next guy but usually I burn out pretty quick. That was until I visited the Musical Instrument Museum. This is without a doubt the greatest museum ever made anywhere in the world. Not only do they have examples of probably every instrument ever made they display them in the most interesting and informative way possible. Including a history of the instrument origins, physical example of each instrument with audio and often video of the instrument being played. I could go on for much longer but do yourself the favor and experience it first hand. Entrance fee is modest for the experience, cafe on-site. Plan to spend several hours. I did not want to leave this museum for the first time in my life."
224,A fantastic museum!,"A museum unlike any other that we've seen.  Extensive collection of musical instruments from around the world, from primitive to ultra modern, manual and automated.  Each exhibit features an audio video demonstration of how the instrument is played and what it sounds like in its original habitat.  Beautiful modern building which features an impressive performance auditorium for their frequent concerts and events.  There is a lovely cafe on the premises with an inviting outdoor patio. There is an instrument restoration lab and a fun filled electronic instrument hall with calliopes and player pianos.  We spent 6 hours visiting the MIM spread over 2 afternoons --  there was so much to see !!  We aren't musicians, but we totally enjoyed this unique collection and the creativity on display.  We understand that the MIM offers programs for children."
225,Don't miss a trip to this unique museum!,"The MIM concerts in their awesome theater are always excellent. The amazing world famous Candy Dulfer (Alto Sax & Vocalists) and her band were fabulous last night, Oct. 2. Thanks MIM and Candy, et. al."
226,Wonderful Museum!,"I have to admit that when I saw the #1 thing on TA in Phoenix was this museum, I was skeptical.  My son loves music through band, but he must have gotten a recessive gene.  I enjoy music, but figured the day was for him.Boy was I wrong.  This place is so well done.  The displays are fabulous.  The musical accompaniment on the headphones is executed so well.  Never seen such solid execution.  The management and staff should be so proud.  The city should be prouder.  What a great day!"
227,A Gem!,"Our second time in Pheonix, Arizona. Our Uber driver as we drove to our hotel, recommended the Musical Instrument Museum as it is near our hotel. It is an unforgettable experience. The museum has a vast collections of musical instrument all over the world! My daughter and I had an amazing ""around the world"" trip listening to music from various countries, cultures and an electric guitar exhibition. A hidden gem of a museum. Worth a visit. Who knew an Uber driver would give such great tourist advice. Of course he got a 5 star rating!"
228,Great Stuff!,"Not only is it a wonderful Museum, but a very good place to eat.  Do take a tour if it is available and then walk around on your own.  I have friends that have visited at least once a year for the past 3 years.  Finally got them to visit and had a hard time to get them to leave!!"
229,Judy,"1. Expect to spend at least five hours or more!2. Wear comfortable shoes!3. Take your camera, phone charger etc..4. For Musicians, music lovers etc...5. Bucket List Item6. All styles of music represented 7. 777 Jackpot Rating!Go and see this place!"
230,The BEST,"I have been here twice so far. Plan to spend at least 3 hours here. You can spend more time than that, a lot of things to look at, video of performers, Live performances and hands-on fun for kids and adults. You get a headset that lets you listen and watch videos for musicians from all over the world."
231,So Much to See!,"Any aspect of music, and ethnic music from any country you can think of.  Most interesting is the U.S. and Canada, but great info about other countries as well.  See how Steinway makes pianos or how Martin makes guitars.  Between 5000 and 6000 instruments on display. Listen to them with your self-guided tour device.  Understandably, they offer a 1 day pass or a 2 day pass.  If you have the stamina, the 2 day pass may not be enough to see everything.  They also have an above-average cafeteria and outdoor eating area that is delightful."
232,What a great unexpected pleasure,"I loved this place... felt like I needed days to take it all in. There's a fun, hands-on section for kids to play guitar, drums and other instruments, but otherwise, it's a lot of walking around and appreciating memorabilia... which is great... if you don't have really small kids along. We saw the women in rock exhibit..so cool!! I haven't been in awhile but they used to allow you to leave and come back the same day as long as you held on to your receipt, which I highly recommend. I would take the kids for an hour or two, drop them off with family/sitter, then come back to look around by yourself... or, grab lunch and come back later."
233,Who woulda thought?,"First of all, you will need more than a day or an afternoon to get through all the attractions!  Plan on coming back for a few Saturdays and take your time to enjoy everything it has to offer!"
234,The Best,Wish I'd had another day to explore this fantastic museum. So many amazing things to see and hear. Much larger than I expected and I'll have to start earlier next time.
235,The best museum in the valley!,"First of all, plan on spending several hours or split the visit up to more than one day. Our group had deep interest in music and this is perhaps the best museum our group had ever seen for musical instruments. The headset system works great (sounds like a library as far as being quiet when headsets are off) and with the displays being split up by continent or region, you can take your time and literally hear the fascinating histories. Unfortunately, we didn't have adequate time to see as much as we would like, but will be headed back as soon as we return to the area."
236,Best-in-Class Performance Space for Music,"Though the entrance cost is somewhat steep, you will not be disappointed with this all-encompassing musical experience.  A ""must see"" musical experience .. you will be amazed at the marvelous presentation of each country's music."
237,The largest musical instrument museum in the world,"I was invited to a company Christmas party here, I didn’t even know it existed. It’s a beautiful place with so much music history. I totally loved it!"
238,"A favorite place to bring AZ visitors.  Also, great acoustics for concerts w/worldwide talent.",We're members of this museum and love it.  Musical instruments from every part of the world can be found here.  It's a wonderful place to take out of town visitors and I always learn something new every time I visit.  There are also some wonderful concerts in the 300 seat theater at the museum.  I highly recommend this unique museum.
239,Who would think this museum would be in AZ.,"I went by myself and had a blast. I play a few instruments and was excited to see that they had an exhibit with fully functional interactive instruments. I was blown away to see that among those instruments they had two harps. I spent about three hours total, split into two 1.5hr visits with a lunch in between. Yes, you can leave the building and come back later in the day without paying! If you’re planning on being there all day, lunch outside might be a nice break. They do however have a cafe for food and drinks. (The barista I had was really knowledgeable on coffee.)This was how I broke down my visit. My first half of the visit, I played the interactive instruments, saw the guitars, and visited the automated music room. My second half, I finished seeing the automated music room, played the piano, chatted with staff, visited the saxophone display and tried to see as much as possible. After quickly walking through the halls as if cramming for a final exam, let’s just say I saw very little during the time I was there since there was so much to dwell on and enjoy. I also talked to the friendly staff and scheduled some time to visit their amazing gift shop.From the reviews, it was apparent that 3hrs was not going to be enough time but i’m not in Phoenix often so I went for it anyways. It was nice to walk through the exhibits and listen to the instruments through the headsets. I had a blast, as I’m sure you will too!"
240,Amazing place to visit,"When people said we should plan on 3-5 hours, I thought that was an awful lot! We should have arrived at 9am and spent the morning. THEN we should have had lunch in the wonderful cafe and done the rest of the museum afterwards. It's truly an adventure that should not be missed!! Children would enjoy it also!"
241,Amazing acoustics,"We were very surprised at the quality and size of this museum.  We went because of all the great reviews, but far and away this blew our minds!!"
242,Very interesting,"I wasn’t sure how this would go over with our young children, and I am not particularly interested in music, but it turned out to be a highlight of our trip to Phoenix. I would say that this is equally a museum of music and of world cultures. We went on a Sunday morning/afternoon and it was not at all crowded (even later on, when there was a concert and more people came for that). There were volunteers/docents all over the place who were invariably enthusiastic and helpful. The price of admission was quite reasonable, and the food at the cafe was the cheapest, the healthiest AND the most delicious we had at any attraction on this trip. I was so pleased that there was no nickel and diming; headsets were included, there was a free craft for kids, there was even a free caricature artist (Colorbox Entertainment, who was absolutely amazing and we gave him a tip of course.) there is a family room with books and musical toys for little kids. Best of all there is an experience room where adults and kids can play all kinds of exotic instruments, even Indonesian gamelan. The mechanical music exhibit was unexpected and so cool. Even the gift shop is well curated. I do have to say that the special Masks of a Congo exhibit wasn’t worth the extra price, because  for me as a non-expert, it was very similar to the rest of the African exhibits upstairs. If you like museums you should budget 4-5 hours or more to see this one. Our kids are 2 and 5 and were well entertained."
243,A Must See !,"Had an afternoon to kill and had heard about this museum.  Decided to give it a try.  Truthfully, based on what I had seen on line, my expectations were really very low.  But man, was I surprised.  First, it is a very modern, very open museum.  There are two floors but most of the exhibits are upstairs.  As you go in, you pick up a receiver and a pair of headphones.  When you get to the exhibits, as you get close to the items in the display, the radio connects to the big screen TV showing the instruments being played.  Each display features maybe 3-5 artists playing various instruments so you get to not only see them, you get to hear them played.  Many are variations on a them, but many are totally unique and make really unique sounds.  There were probably 100 plus such 'exhibits' to sample.  In addition to the instruments themselves, several of the exhibits show craftsman making the instruments.  There are also some incredible costumes and clothing that go along with the music.  Note: this museum is NOT near downtown.  It is out a ways.  But if you have any interest in the history of music and how it influences culture, you have got to see this place."
244,Mim,"The MIM brings instruments from around the world to life and provides a truly unique cultural experience. There are over 7,000 instruments on display from around 200 different countries. Most displays are enhanced by state-of-the-art audio and video elements that allow guests to observe and hear the sounds of the instruments being played."
245,Amazing museum,"Visited the museum with our nephews and quite frankly, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it. Boy was I wrong. It is an amazing place and came across almost like a history of the world.  It appeared as if every musical instrument was exhibited and every type of music was demonstrated.  Thru our headphones we listened to everything from Memphis blues to New Orleans jazz to Honky Tonk.  We also enjoyed our nephew sitting down and playing a classical number on a piano in the lobby.  If you get a chance, don't miss this place."
246,"If you love music, you will love this place!","We spent the better part of a day there and enjoyed every minute and will have to return to see more because it is impossible to see it all.  Informative, interesting, moving and fun.  Must see while in Phoenix."
247,It's ALL here!!,"My wife found a listing for the MIM before we traveled to California.  On the way home we decided to make a 2-hour visit, even if it took us an extra hour out of our way.  Well, once inside we were so entranced that we stayed till closing time!  There are 6,000 items on display, mainly authentic, field-collected musical instruments from all over the world.  There are displays with many hundreds of short, evocative, and informative videos showing the instrument being played and often accompanied by song or dance. Each video plays on a headset, so that no display's audio interferes with another's audio.  The displays are respectful of traditions and expertly done. We have been to many of the countries and we felt reintroduced to them!  The museum is spacious and magical.  The floor plan is open, so that browsing is very pleasant, even with many visitors."
248,Most All-Inclusive Display of Musical Instruments From Around the World,Some of our out of town friends visited this first and then a year later they went again with us after they had already highly recommended it to us initially.  My wife and I ended up going a second time the following year.  It is amazing with the museum showing the development…
249,Amazing!,"Go here when you want to be entertained, listen to the msical history of the regions of the world, or just relax.  It took me about four visits to see the entire place but you could if you have an afternoon devoted to it.  My favorite region was Asia.  The theater also has concerts worth seeing."
250,Lee,"I was blown away by the variety of musical instruments, the incredible displays of various musicians and their instruments, the diversity of music and instruments from all over the world. I particularly enjoyed seeing how Steinway pianos were made. So much to see! I would get the two day pass next time"
251,A really intend worthwhile experience.,"What a surprise.  I enjoy music, but I am not a music nut.. However, this is a must do when you are in Phoenix.  We were actually at the museum for over six hours and did not see everything.  You must use the head sets.  You see the instruments, even see how some are made on the monitors.  You are moving to the music and having a wonderful time.  Many exhibits take you on a trip down memory lane.  Joy!"
252,Great afternoon to do,"When visiting Scottsdale with a group of friends, we spent an entire day at the MIM. Everyone except our youngest member (mid-30s) LOVED the museum. The exhibits are on two floors, with the upstairs galleries grouped by region and country. We spent the vast majority of our time in Europe and USA/Canada. We also enjoyed the Artist Gallery on the first floor, which featured artifacts and music of a variety of well-known artists. The admission price ($20/adult) seems high, but the museum experience is worth the money. Upon buying admission, you get a headset with headphones and a receiver. When you walk up an exhibit, you begin to hear music or commentary that matches whatever is being projected on the video screen. We all enjoyed the immersive quality of this amazing museum. Several of us ate at the cafe. The food was good, but a bit on the pricey side. We also visited the museum shop, which had a good selection of items to buy as souvenirs or gifts."
253,A must see in Phoenix!,"Being new to Phoenix, we're just learning of new attractions. Friends visited recently and we decided to take in the Museum of Musical Instruments. What a treat! It's huge, so allot plenty of time. The exhibits are fascinating, and  beautifully done. Thd building and grounds are beautiful as well."
254,Music fun!,"When I heard that we were going to the MIM as it is known, I thought 💭 “ That’s nice.” Yessssss, it IS NICE! More than NICE! I didn’t want to leave. There are Instruments 🎺 from all over the world. We had a marvelous docent who clearly knew his field of music 🎶 and clearly loved it!! There were several exhibits of many musicians like Elvis 🕺 Presley, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison. There’s a wonderful exhibit on Jazz featuring Satchamo.- Louis Armstrong.Very very worth a visit!!!"
255,Engaging! ,"This was once a private collection - which blossomed into a full-blown museum. Instruments from all over the world - unique instruments like Elvis's Martin D38, John Lennon's piano and memorabilia from many of the world's greatest musicians.  A mini-workshop of the Martin Guitar Factory and the Stratovarius violin factory were my favorites. I must say that I was disappointed that while Canada was mildly represented, Gordon Lightfoot and Anne Murray were missing - Canada's two music icons."
256,Best in USA,"This is SO comprehensive it deserves:    -An entire day, if you possibly can afford the time (at least 1/2 day)    -a 5 star rating on tourism sites for Phoenix, AZ    -preplanning for any special exhibits or interests    -special passes for Musicology students at most any level...or many others    -children    -lunch in their cafe"
257,Outstanding Museum!,"My first  visit to the"" MIM"", as they call it, was spent 4 hours daily for 5 days out of the  7  total  I spent in the Phoenix area.  Yes, I bought an annual pass, even as a non-resident.  Yes, I  found, as Bre'r Rabbit found, my laughing place. I couldn't even find, with my verbal, songwriterly skills, enough superlatives to describe the joys of this place.There is enough variety, history , and the experience of our shared humanity to awe and inspire any and all  visitors. I came away gladder than ever to be a human being."
258,DON'T MISS THIS,"I can't gush enough about this place! Before my trip to Phoenix, many people recommended it to me. I'm so glad they did. I love music and also play some instruments--plus, I love to travel. The international scope of this museum is amazing. I sent pictures to a bunch of friends who live or have lived outside the USA, and they loved seeing the native instruments. There are displays for every country and some additional groups...and then some. There are also some instruments you can play, including a Steinway! I can't recommend this museum enough. No matter where you are, if you love music, you need to visit."
259,DON'T MISS THIS ONE.,"MI M is a wonderful place to visit.  II t will definitely take you the entire day, and you may even wish to go back."
260,Great Museum!,"It's no surprise this is the #1 attraction in Phoenix. You should go early as you likely will want to stay all day - two if you are really into music. It is obvious a great deal of research and preparation (and money) went into creating this place. It's creation was co-sponsored by the former CEO of Target Stores. The displays are incredibly precise with so many uniquely preserved instruments worldwide. The sections are set out geographically by continent and then by individual countries. They provide a receiver and headphones so you can listen to the different music at each display. There are also two rooms where you can try out playing the instruments so this is great for families.  Another room features individual significant American musical artists. They have a room where you can see where they are repairing and restoring instruments There is also an excellent cafe that has very high-quality food including soups, salads, sandwiches, some entrees, and even a few desserts plus a wide selection of beverages and there is plenty of inside and outside seating. The prices are a little high but not unusual for a museum. The place is about 10 years old but looks like new and beautifully landscaped. There is also a nice gift shop and they have several concerts for additional fees so it would be good to research in advance. There is an elevator to the second floor so the place is wheelchair friendly.  Please vote helpful if you found this review useful."
261,Fantastic museum for music lovers,"We have travelled to over 50 countries - and not seen one like this. Musical instruments from every country in the World have been collected and tastefully displayed. The early instruments are all there, as indeed are the more recent ones. Shows the evolution in each country. Also fascinating is the transfer of music across regions due to immigration and travel. We spent a whole day at the Museum - could have happily gone again."
262,Better than I could have imagined!,"I haven’t touched a musical instrument since high school fifty years ago, but I often listen to music on Spotify. I was pleasantly surprised by the self-guided tour. Not only did we journey through the special Congo exhibit, we saw the masks, costumes and instruments, heard the music and watched historical videos. The artists display had representative artists from all genres, complete with video and audio clips. Hands on experiences in the exploratory room were great fun. By the time we went to the second floor with instruments from around the world, we had spent hours and realized we’d definitely need to return."
263,An outstanding museum in Scottsdale,"I absolutely loved the MIM. Prior to my visit, I read many TA rave reviews (to which I have nothing substantial to add) so I wanted to simply share my experience and some practical logistics:An Uber from my downtown Phoenix hotel took about 40 min ($30) but was easy to do (both ways.)I purchased ticket ($20) on line (easy on cell phone, ticket attached to email receipt to display for admission.)You get free headphones and a receiver to wear on lanyard, use these! (I noticed some folks didn’t.)To the right of the front desk there is an explanatory alcove which will help enormously in preparing you for your visit; additionally a docent approached me while I was reading it and reviewed the features with me. In brief, there is a transmitter at the bottom of each separate display which automatically transmits music to your receiver (then to your headphones.) Sometimes the signal is blocked (like if a group is right in front of it) so reposition yourself. The music transmits automatically (don’t have to punch in codes or press any buttons at all.) The transmitter looks like a white plaque and has the title/performer/composer, etc. listed next to a letter (A,BC...) This corresponds to the snippet of the music video you can see on the flat screen monitor that is included and on a continuous loop in each display (and will have a corresponding A,B,C... in the lower portion of the screen.) That way, you can easily identify what is playing and linger if you wish to wait for the next song. Genius!I arrived at 10:00 on a Friday (not crowded) and spent 1.5 hours on first floor (Artist gallery, Mechanical music gallery and experience gallery - you must play the Theremin!) then ate lunch at first floor Allegro cafe (surprisingly tasty panini and sides; lovely adjacent patio for al fresco dining; cost as is customary for museum cafes) then returned to Mechanical music for the noon demonstration of the Orchestrion (not to be missed!)I spent 3.5 hours on second floor (basically each continent in a large area with each individual country represented in separate displays.) Honestly, I could have stayed longer; on my next visit I will consider a 2 day pass!"
264,"Regular, welcome injection of MIM culture",You might think a museum of musical instruments sounds boring. You might say that you are not that into music. Go to this museum--you will love it. The displays of instruments have samples of music from that type of music and they are from all over the world. Don't miss this museum.
265,Fascinating,"My husband was the one who thought this would be interesting, and I was only so-so on it.  We went, I was very much surprised on how wonderful this museum actually is. We spent about 2 hours there and only had to leave because of a prior committment.  We plan on going back again to see all that we missed.  Hightly recommend for kids of all ages!"
266,The depth of the music industry and instruments was astonishing!!,Did I even know something this extensive even existed!!? Incredible. Music instruments from all over the world. I mean — Everywhere! This is a must. Huge. Keep walking. It will take a few trips!
267,Visit with college friends,"We weren't too sure if this would be a museum we would enjoy but given all the rave reviews we decided to go on a rainy day in Phoenix.Definitely exceeded expectations.  So much to see.  Particularly enjoyed the self-guided tour aspect - you receive a headset and as you go by each exhibit, it automatically plays the audio.Enjoyed all the various exhibits of well-known musicians in the Artists Gallery.  The world exhibits on the second floor are really interesting.At Noon and 3 p.m. the 25-foot Apollonia plays - 25 feet wide, designed to play a variety of instruments.  Recommend timing a visit to watch this and get there early to get a good view. Located in the Mechanical Music Gallery on the main level (by the cafe)The cafe offers a good selection of drinks and food.Anticipate spending at least 3 hours to tour."
268,One of most FABULOUS museums we've ever visited,"My family and I came here on vacation at the request of my brother. He is a band instructor and musician, so he was dying to come here when he heard about it. I found this place to be fascinating. The exhibits took us through the history of music for countries from all around the world. The self guided tour was perfect as well. It allowed me to explore at the pace that I wanted and listen to each country's music for as long as I wanted to. I was blown away with the quality of this place, and I would love to come back again in the future!"
269,So much material you'll need to make more than one trip,If you are at all interested in music this is a must see.  We were on a bit of a schedule and had to cut our visit short after about 3 hours.  This is just an amazing collection of instruments and knowledge beautifully displayed.
270,Saw a great concert,"After reading others’ reviews, my expectations were pretty high and, after I spent the day at MIM, I was in awe of everything it has to offer.  The interactive experiences of not only viewing real musical instruments from all over the world, but being able to watch and listen to people performing with those instruments made my day at the museum rich and memorable!"
271,Musical instrument museum,It was amazing to see so many countries with such diverse musical instruments. We saw instruments that were unheard of. We enjoyed the audio tour of the many booths of attractions. We would recommend this to every age level! It was so educational!
272,Amazing place ,"A tremendous collection.  But wait, you're thinking that looking at musical instruments can't be very much fun?  Now imagine, you are equipped with a headset and in front of you is an instrument and on a video screen, you see AND hear it being played!  This is different and fun.  Oh and educational too."
273,"Like Nothing Else You've Done (Unless You've Visited, Of Course)","Whether you're into music or not, this museum is a must-see. We were incredibly surprised not only at the plethora of instruments, but the information and historical value experienced throughout the museum. At the end you can even try out some of the musical instruments if you feel so inclined. There is a nice gift shop as well as place to get a quick bite to eat."
274,Excellent musical experience. ,"Founded in 2010 by Robert J. Ulrich, former CEO and chairman of Target Corporation, the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, is the largest museum of its type in the world. Designed after the Musee de la Musique in Paris, France, and inspired by the Musical Instrument Museum in Brussels, Belgium, the MIM cost $250 million and covers about 200,000 square feet with two floors of galleries. The collection of over 15,000 musical instruments and associated objects includes examples from nearly 200 countries and territories and represent every inhabited continent. Some larger countries such as the United States, Mexico, India, China and Brazil have multiple displays with subsections for different types of ethnic, folk and tribal music. The museum also has a 299-seat theater for concerts and a cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. Among the most interesting displays is the Artist Gallery on the ground floor, which features exhibits for such musical artists as Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Pablo Casals and Taylor Swift. See clothes and guitar of Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana's guitar, Tito Puente's timbales, the Steinway piano used by John Lennon to compose the song ""Imagine,"" a Roy Orbison exhibit, Taylor Swift's Les Paul guitar and cordless microphone, an old-time Nickelodean piano player, an 1886 Model C Parlor Grand Piano and an array of instruments that shaped the North American musical landscape, including the sousaphone, ukulele and electric guitar."
275,Don't Miss It,"There is nothing like this museum in the USA. To be fair I cannot adequately describe it, but here goes.It has instruments from every country on Earth. It also includes video clips for most of t tohem and in most instance multiple clips. Actually 48 hours of video.The juxtaposition of countries allies you to see how they have swapped and traded instruments. There is a natural progression to development and spreading of each. The similarities and differences as each country then moved to make them their own.Spent 7 full no -stop hours and need another 5-6 to finish. They even have a ticket to cover two days.If in the Phoenix area and only have time for one museum, this must be the one."
276,Incredible museum!,This was the last place we visited as we left Scottsdale.  We thought we could see it in an hour.  We spent about 6 hour and did not do it justice.  Instruments from all over the world are covered.  There are headsets for a self guided tour that link to information boxes and videos at most of the displays.  Sometimes my unit did not pick up the sound soon enough but that is a minor complaint.  The diversity of instruments and the videos/discussions were absolutely stunning.  The place is extremely clean and bright.  My wife was in a wheel chair and the site was very friendly to those with mobility limitations.  Our last stop was the gift store.  We thought we might get a couple of t-shirts for the grandsons but we found many other things we wanted.  The items are unusual and suited to the themes of the museum.  The sales assistants were WONDERFUL - best I have ever encountered.  We left as very pleased customers.  Would recommend to everyone.  It is also family friendly.
277,Great museum - almost impossible to get all the way through,"While visiting in Phoenix, Arizona, a friend recommended that we visit the Musical Instrument Museum.  He had visited several years earlier and said it was excellent and he wanted to return.  We thought we might spend 2 hours there.  The museum is a beautiful structure that you enjoy even walking up to.  Once inside it is a truly well-organized and well thought out and truly an amazing collection and history of the musical instruments of our world.  The museum is set up by Country (and they put a small map on a corner of the display to show you exactly where on the planet that country is located),  and further developed by additional categories...rural, folk, jazz, etc.  You get to learn that bagpipes have been around for hundreds of years in many countries in Europe and that pianos have only been around since 1709!!   We spent 3 hours viewing exhibits (before we took a break for a delicious lunch in their Cafe) and did not finish seeing everything we wanted to see.  There will be another visit to the MIM in the future to finish this amazing tour!  I recommend this museum for anyone and especially for anyone with an interest in music."
278,Awesome Museum for all ages,"There is simply far too much material in here to get it all in one go.  I was blown away by the Buddy Rich and Alice Cooper exhibits, but everyone will find something they like."
279,Great Show,"I’m not into music, but this place is absolutely captivating. Interestingly, Phoenix is singularly chockablock with immersive art experiences: MIM, Yayoi Kusama’s Fireflies at Phoenix Art Museum, and Wonderspaces.  This one, however, is so extensive it’s really a two day excursion.  Several hours on day 1 and several hours day 2. We are the kind of folks who can do an average size museum (or the Prado) in about 90 minutes, reading plaques and curation. This one is different. There are videos you must listen to. The Musician room features artifacts and video clips from so many 20th century greats from Celia Cruz and Tito Puente to Johnny Cash and Buddy Holly. The Experience room allows you to play a theramin, which is unforgettable, as well as a variety of others.  Then there are the hundreds of musical instruments —some you have never imagined— organized by region and then by country. The curation is out of this world, clear and informative. Staff is eager to please and inform.  Zounds! What an impossibly ambitious and spectacularly executed enterprise this is.  Worth a trip from anywhere."
280,Very fascinating and educational,"I thought this may be a nice way to spend part of an afternoon but it was so much more.  It was fascinating to learn about all the instruments used throughout the world. I t was also like a mini geography lesson as well. The The downstairs artists, mechanical room and demo rooms were a lot of fun. I would highly recommend this for people of any age."
281,Fun and educational,"So, it never rains in Phoenix?  When it does it pours.  If the sun is shining or flash flood alerts are chiming, the MIM is an amazing place to visit.  We spent hours and have a lot left for another visit.  The tour is done by listening to the videos of instruments being played.  Young and old will enjoy this visit. You don’t have to be a musician, just enjoy music."
282,Ms.,"We entered the Museum at 3 p.m.and should have gone a lot earlier. Friends had told us that I was good, but we were unprepared for just how good!!Could have stayed for 4 hours!"
283,Great all around.,"Amazingly huge collection of a wide variety of musical instruments from around the world. Not only delightful to the eyes, but entertaining to the ears as well. More than just a display of different instruments. It is also an educational experience on musical history, culture, high notes about known and unknown artists and much more. A must -see for music lovers of different genre. Well worth the visit. A whole day tour is recommended."
284,A must see in PHX,"When my wife suggested that we visit the MIM I admit I didn’t expect much. Well  as I turned into the parking lot to see the beautiful 250 million dollar building I  thought we were onto something special..Inside is a high tech encyclopedic exhibit of not only musical instruments,but videos and examples of music and dance from  EVERY country in the world. There is a large subsection dedicated to American music covering every style imaginable from blues, to Zydeco to Klezmer  and maybe 50 more categories. Other sections highlight famous artists,the manufacture of instruments and speciL exhibits. My wife and I voted for 5 hours and left amazed and invigorated."
285,Put this one on your “To Do” list!,This was an amazing place to visit and we really needed more time to do it justice.  It took hours just to visit the 2nd level which had the history of music and instruments and culture from all over the world.  This museum is unique in the world and so happy we took the time to visit.  We came back the next day and had lunch outdoors and enjoyed a very healthy luncheon.  I highly recommend the t the to visit Phoenix or Scottsdale that you give yourself a day to visit.  You will not be disappointed.
286,Don’t miss this treasure!,Spectacular venue - too many things to see in one visit.   One could spend several hours savoring all of the displays.  I love the variety of presentation applications as well - some are interactive and some more visual - all are top notch.  Please do not hesitate to visit - incredible value - amazing experience!!
287,Christmas party,"This is our first visit and I live locally but just have never gone there before. Even though I'm a musician and play musical instruments, I thought the museum might be a little boring. But I was wrong about that because it has a number of different rooms and areas where you can experience just about every instrument you've ever thought of and more that you never knew existed from around the world with interactive displays, videos, audio, rare instruments of every type that you can get up close and personal to and learn all about them. They also have a very good restaurant with some great food and we enjoyed that very much. The outdoor and indoor surroundings and layout was very well done and we would definitely go back again. We highly recommend it to everyone whether you just enjoy listening to music or you play an instrument. It's definitely a museum, but so much more, especially for music lovers. 👍🎼"
288,Amazing Museum,"In a short visit from the East Coast, I decided to spend an hour or two at the MIM. It was a moving experience that I needed to pull myself out of after 3+ hours. Here is why I believe it was so moving:1) Emotionally Engaging - This was the biggest surprise for me. At every station, especially in the world instrument section I felt a personal connection to those people playing the instruments. The combination of physical presence of the instruments, striking both by beauty or some lack there of; and the sounds/visuals of the artists playing; and what I knew about the culture and politics of the region made me feel a bond with what were local village/town community. 2) Technical Flow - This is the first time in a museum context that I thought the use of video and personalized streaming worked flawlessly.  By having personalized receivers that only broadcast when you were in front of a station each museum goer could get their information at the pace of their pleasure, navigate to less crowded areas, or linger at areas where the artists and their instruments were most moving. No fiddling with tech required!Fantastic experience that I hope informs other museum exhibit design."
289,So much to see and learn,"If you love music, any kind of music, you'll be enthralled by this one.  And I don't say that lightly.  Even if you know very little about music, your imagination and your mind will thank you for the adventure and stimulation.  The food wasn't bad either."
290,A great way to spend the day enjoying all types of music.,"If you are in Phoenix, and have an interest in world music, don't miss a chance to visit this museum, which has a wonderfully displayed and curated collection of musical instruments from all over the world.  Divided into collections by continent, and then by country, there are examples of hundreds of different instruments, from primitive home made types, to sophisticated manufactured instruments. Each display is accompanied by a multimedia screen that runs short videos of the instruments being played by musicians in their natural habitat.  There were also instruments made of recycled, every day materials, from Brazil if I recall correctly, that provided underprivileged youth the opportunity to learn to play an instrument, which I remembered seeing in a television documentary once. There's not enough time to write about all the great things we saw and heard... Go see it for yourself.We spent a couple of hours there, which was really not enough, but they closed for the day!"
291,Wow!!,"We went by thinking to spend an hour or two, but wound up staying 5 hours and still didn't see it all. Very well done. Each area features either music of a particular genre, a particular country, or a different type of instrument. Hard to think of a musical type or instrument type that wasn't covered. As one approaches each display, a series of videos begins to play, with music of each type, and a brief narrative. Sometimes the video seemed too short, but most were very well done. If you love music of different types, you'll love this place. Highly recommended."
292,Blew my mind :),"What a fun day! I got there shortly after they opened and finally called it quits shortly after 4pm. Couldn't see everything, to exhausted 😊. If time allows get a two day pass and see it all."
293,Special and Unique Museum,"If we hadn’t seen the advertising poster at the airport as we arrived, we’d never knew what we were missing. To be able to learn the history of the different musical instruments and the performers they highlighted was just mind blowing. We spent over 4 hours and still didn’t see everything. We will be back, if you live there, how could you not be a supporter. Just a wonderful place to visit. Visit pubsgrubbeer.com"
294,A TRULY UNIQUE CULTURAL EXPERIENCE AND ONE OF THE TOP THINGS TO SEE AND DO IN PHOENIX,"We stumbled upon the MIM quite by accident, and decided to get tickets a few days later. What a neat experience. We chose the self- directed option, which was great. Each of us had our own listening device and could go at our own pace.The museum is deceiving- larger and more in depth than I had anticipated. We were expecting just to see unique instruments, and it was WAY more than that. If you are curious to learn, you’ll gain some geography knowledge and how people and music are different, yet unified. We all agreed, it would be neat to get the two day pass and break it up a bit.The cafeteria has lovely food prepared fresh each day,  and the courtyard seating is a treat, especially for us coming from the North.Finally, check out the concerts that are available at night. We purchased tickets  and came back another night to see a great ensemble in the wonderful concert hall.All in all, a fun, unique, activity."
295,Outstanding world wide collection.,"We were blown away. As soon as we got our tickets, we were given headphones. Every time we stood in front of a TV screen, the program would automatically begin playing. Each program usually had 3-5 parts consisting primarily of examples of the music produced by the instruments displayed.And in case you think this might be a stuffy place, one of the first exhibits was of an empty guitar case with this identifying information: Air Guitar made of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and dreams. The air guitar is played around the globe. World championships are held annually in Oulu, Finland.The museum was overwhelming. A docent sent us to the “Artists Hall,” which highlighted particular artists and their instruments. Sometimes the displays included outfits or other paraphernalia from the artists, too. We loved watching videos of everyone from John Denver to Tito Puente. As we wandered from continent to continent, we saw thousands and thousands of instruments. Most we’d never seen in our lives. We certainly didn’t know what they sounded like until we watched videos. We were there about three hours and felt we’d barely scratched the surface. Since there are more than 15,000 instruments and artifacts from more than 200 countries across the globe, that was inevitable."
296,THE museum to visit if you only have one to see,"I didn't expect to be blown away by MIM but I was. I'm not musical and can't play an instrument. Maybe because of that I never really thought about or comprehend the huge part music plays in all cultures AND how neighboring countries flavor of music influences and shapes each other's. It was fascinating!The cafeteria at the museum is awesome, the staff are nice and the building is immaculate. I can see why the TV companies showcase the place every time the NFL is town and why it's the number 1 attraction in the Valley."
297,Music Lovers’ Delight,"Being new to the Phoenix area, I was looking for someplace to explore, and this seemed like a good place to start.  I expected some small, dusty museum that would be pretty empty of people.  Boy was I was wrong.  It's spectacular, modern museum (Smithsonian quality) that is fascinating...and crowded.  Displays of musical instruments and related things from virtually every country on the planet.  Lots of great cultural information.  My highest recommendation!"
298,"Paradisical ! The best museum I've ever been in,",I wasn’t sure if i’d enjoy this but it was awesome. To really get the most of the tour I would recommend planning 3-4 hours here. The tour is self guided and interactive so there’s something for everyone. We really enjoyed our selves.
299,Extraordinary Experience,"OK, so in early October we visited Scottsdale, and were a bit dubious and yet intrigued enough that we decided to give the Musical Instrument Museum a quick look.  We’re oh so glad we did.First of all, there’s no such thing as a “quick look” here.  This place will entice you, then enthrall you and finally captivate you and hold you hostage to its charms.  Like a good book, you won’t be able to put it down.  Like a great bag of salty chips, you can’t eat just one.  You’ll be compelled to savor every display on every aisle in every gallery on every floor.Your brain will be full, and still you’ll soldier on.  Your feet will ache so you’ll grab a quick sit-down and then get back on the trail.Everywhere you look you’ll be drawn like a moth to a bonfire.  Every instrument will beckon, every video will entice, every detailed display will captivate (the Martin guitar display was my favorite), every authentic costume will dazzle.You’ll love this place.  Your feet will hate this place.  When you tire, seek a bench or head to the Allegro Café for a fuel and rest stop, and then get right back at it.This is more of an adult place, although they reputedly do have some displays and activities for younger folk.And check out the concert series, where they feature big-name musical talents like George Benson, David Benoit, David Cook, David Sanborn, Estaban, Jim Brickman and many others.Kinda wish we still lived in Scottsdale, just so we could frequent the MIM and their fine concert series.Put this place on your list, you’ll be glad you did.Dean Herrington"
