138,Take a tonga ride!,"This Gate is very close to both of the Imambaras. This gate is really beautiful, take a view of this Gate by Tanga ride which will be the best option."

140,Old world charm,If you visit old Indian city you can saw many of Darwazas on entrance of many places..But Rumi Darwaza is unique among all of them. This type of archaeological jewel you can find on City of Nawab...Lucknow.
141,Flying visit to see this popular gate,"Located between the Clock Tower and the Bara Imambara, it is architecturally beautiful.You can get a good view while walking or driving past from the Clock Tower to the Bara Imambara or vice versa.Do stop and have a good look to appreciate the architecture. It is a 2 minute attraction, and is also visible from the Clock Tower and from the Bara Imambara.The traffic is very chaotic and heavy in the evenings from 5 pm, and finding a parking spot is difficult."
142,Nothing but a gate,Just in front of Bada Imambara is this grand gate called rumi darwaza. One can hire a tonga to experience the royalty of the path that goes from bada imambara to chota imambara through the rumi darwaza. The pebble type wide road here gives a totally different experience.
143,A grand entrance!!,"There is nothing special, but if you are already in Lucknow, you must see it. Crazy traffic and massive people...."

152,Great gate to have a look,the view from two sides are different and its a giant of a gate. Really very interesting and a great place to see
153,Lovely gate,"When you look at places to see in Lucknow, Rumi Darwaza comes right up there. However, this is just a gate to enter the old city. Best thing is that it is walking distance from Bara Imambara, so won't take more than 7-8 minutes of one's time."
154,Good place,From bada Imaam baada you can see 3 doors and it will look like a home.From Chota Imaam baada you can see 1 door and it will look like a gate.It is built on a pathway.Gadar movie scene where Sunny Deol enters with his truck through a door is shot at this place.

160,Gigantic Gate Notable Mughal Architecture,"An archtectural marvel by nawabs of Oudh. Seams to be a single gate way but from the outer side, from Imambara side is a completely different 3 way entry, it must be preserved in good condition."
161,Another magnificant structure...,"Nice place to visit. Place is near Bada Imambara. Many other places. Clock Tower and Chicken Cloth Factory, Nimbu Park is good places to visit. Darwaja is historically and artistically very important landmark. This darwaza has been filmed for Film Gaddar and shown as Lahore Gate. This information given to us by Guide."
162,Beautiful Mughal architecture,Rumi Darwaja is in very nice condition.Be at evenimg after 3 PM if planning to visit this Darwaja. You can visit BARA EMAMBARA adjecent to this gate.
163,Just Ride through it,This is a very outstanding City gate loading to bara imambara. The  promenade with cobbled streets leadings in to the old city before this gate is amazingly colonial reminding us of European City. Great.
164,Must visit and photograph,"I must say that if you are in Lucknow, you should once visit this place to see its architecture, it’s really nice if you know a little bit about this place. This was actually built in 1784 - 86, it has approx 69 feet entrance and looks really great once you cross this.. many vehicles go it from this gate as its in in the middle of the road.. also people say that there is no visible support to this high entrance.. make sure you also pass this gate.."
165,Glory of Lucknow,Rumi Darwaza in the heart of Lucknow looms over the busy everyday traffic of Lajpatnagar. It is very famous among all of ages
166,Gateway to the old city in Lucknow,Rumi darwaaza is one of the things Lucknow is  known for....... visit to be a part of Awadhi grandeur
167,Lucknow gateway,"Constructed in 1784 by Nawab Asaf ud daula, this landmark gives you goose bumps when you pass beneath it. Situated across Bada Imambaada, its architecture has a Turkish touch"
168,Awadhi Architecture.,Iconic structure synonymous with Lucknow. As Delhi is personified by India Gate ; Lucknow is personified by Rumi Darwaaza
169,A HERITAGE SITE,"very good architecture.  Crossed the Darwaza in a tonga and enjoyed the ride.  Also saw the Clock Tower, which was good too!!"
170,FACE OF LUCKNOW’S HERITAGE ,"just a huge door under which a lot of vehicles pass by everyday. its no architectural marvel, just a huge door made by one of the nawabs"
171,Rumi Darwaza,We enjoy a lot during our visit when we are moving to chota imambada we just cross the door rummi darwaja..cleaning place and tempo guide was coperative there specially tange wala..love to visit
172,very dusty road,"Rumi darwaza is a gate situated near bara imambara, this is nice historical place, there is nothing special."
173,Rumi Darwaza/Turkish gate,It is a gate located near bara imamabada. It looks like three gates from inside and one from another side. This is a type of muslim architecture. A good tourist attraction in Lucknow.
174,Nawabi gateway ,This is a short stop to make en route Bada Imambara so stop and marvel at this imposing gateway that leads to the city's most famous sight.
175,Beautiful Hostorical Gateway of Lucknow!!,"One of the most beautiful gates,I have come across, very impressive considering when it was built, still a bustling part of town."
176,Awesome gateway,"Rumi darwaza is an imposing gateway which was built under the patronage of Nawab Asaf-Ud-dowlah in 1784. It is an example of excellent Awadhi architecture. It is adjacent to the Bada Imambara in Lucknow was used to mark the entrance to Old Lucknow City, but as the City of Nawabs grew and expanded, it was later used as an entrance to a palace which was later demolished by the British insurgents. We did a tonga ride around the place and overall the experience was awesome!"
177,LUCKNOW GATEWAY,It’s great architectural work. It is Near Imambara.Ancient construction. One time visit place.Roomi Darwaza
178,Remembering the time it was !!!,"Very attractively constructed and maintained. Draws the attention of the traveler from a distance. Located close to Imambara, and easily approachable. Better to see it on the way rather than making it a separate destination."
179,Gateway of Lucknow,"I had come to visit Lucknow and had to visit the bada imambara and Rumi darwaza was right in front. It was a beautiful piece of architecture and truly symbolizes the ''nawabi ana"" of Lucknow, the grandeur and flamboyance. I loved just looking at it and taking some front shots. However to take a full shot, one would need aerial view. Worth a visit here."
180,Lucknow know shaan,"wow its awesome gate in lucknow from mughal, i really love to drive on this road really feel amazing ."
181,Must Visit site in lucknow,"This is a specially made Darwaza or door on the main road which is no more a spot to stand and click photos or do something there, you can pass through the door as that's the only road for all the vehicles to pass through! Could have made a podium or something to click photos !"
182,Art and architecture,We visited Rumi Darwaza - an arch near to Bara Imambara.  It used to mark the entrance to Old Lucknow City.
183,Rumi gate,"This is just beside Imambara but it is not maintained now a days. Also, being on main road it doesn't have proper view. Altough it is one of the attraction to see history of Lucknow"
184,This is just an average place to visit,"Also known as the Turkish gate this Rumi darwaza is a gate in its own unique way. just adjacent to the bara imambara stands this magnificent gate but in ruins. The gate really needs some maintenance work, a part of it has already fallen and is closed to the visitors. The gate looks different from both the sides. It's difficult to find it quite unless you up early in the morning for some good shots as this gate is an integral part of the city and is constantly flooded with people all the time."
185,Beautiful,Rumi Darwaza is located in front of Bada Imambada. Nice place to click some photos. The architecture is different from both sides
186,Rumi Darwaza,"Rumi Darwaza,Built by Nawab Asaf us daula in 1784, is a historical monument near Bada ImamBada, Lucknow. Takes you back in time showing the brilliance of awadhi architecture. It has a big lantern on top of it which lights this monument at night. Definitely a place to visit in Lucknow."
187,RUmi Gate,A big gate with architecture engraved on it. Near to Imambara. Nothing very much attractive. Big market.
188,Interesting piece of architecture ,visitors can easily view this while going from here to there passing by the darwaza that is the door.
189,Not worth a visit,"The Rumi Darwaza in Lucknow,  is an imposing gateway which was built by Nawab Asaf-Ud-dowlah in 1784. It used to mark the entrance to Old Lucknow City but over the time things has been changed to fast development and increasing traffic. A good place to visit and see the architecture of the place which is sixty feet tall."
190,Exquisite,this is just a gate between the bara imambara and chota imambara.big structure.nothing much to see.you can take a tonga ride if you like
191,Beautiful piece of architecture,A big door on the road near bada imambara one side of it shows it has 3doors on the other side their is one big door
192,An Image of Lucknow,The Rumi Darwaza is an example of the fine architectural style of Awadh. It was constructed in the year 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula. This gate is also known by the name of Turkish Gateway since it is supposed to be identical in design to a similar gateway in ancient Constantinople.
193,A piece of rome,Rumi darwaja is beautiful . It was huge and my kids also liked it . There was huge traffic there . Never saw such huge and beautiful darwaja ...
194,Rumi Darwaza,This dawaza( gate) is situated next to Bada Immanbada on Hazaratganj to Thakurganj Road on Bank of Given Gomati.This Darwaza featured in Movie Umrao Jann (Old ).
195,Depiction of classic architecture!,Very fine example of the old style. And looks awsome as it spans that main thorough fare. Well preserved
196,Pride of the city,All these monuments are in the vicinity of 1 km. These all seem like  links of chain. There is nothing adventurous or worth more than a glance.
197,Masti,"Made on an unexpected road which is 24x7 open for people to use. This is a piece of architecture that revives the poems of Jalaluddin Rumi.If you've ever read and loved his writings this is the place to visit.Doesn't require any special entry fees or anything its just a beauty standing in the bustling roads of Lucknow.Surrounded by many street food stalls, so you can bite on some nice snacks when around.Overall it's a must visit for any tourist/visitors who finds themselves in Lucknow."
198,Adjoining with bada imambara,A gate in a road near Bada Imambara. The gate has a nice Mughal architecture from both side it look different.
199,Magnificent architecture known as Entrance of old Lucknow.,The Rumi Darwaza is right next to the Bara Imambara. It's an interesting piece of work where you see three storeys on one side and just one from the other end. The design also reflects the two things Lucknow is passionate about -- food and chikankari.
200,A drive through ,It is just 10 minutes to see this darwaza the gate. on one side it is mohamedian aechitecture and from other side it is indian. it is a mere entry ans exit gate constructed in unison. even after three centuries they stand tall. worth viewing.
201,History revisited,"I went to Rumi Darwaza. The Rumi Darwaza was built in the 1780s by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. It's unusual but imposing, and said to be a copy of an entrance gate in Istanbul. 'Rumi' (relating to Rome) is the term Muslims applied to Istanbul when it was still Byzantium, the capital of the Eastern Roman empire. It is great place to go."
202,One of kind gate,Lucknow know yaad know Jaay tho rumi darwaza hi the first  think which comes in our mind and then the taste of tunday  in kebab.
203,It's a gate ,It's look look enterence door of Lucknow which is looking so beautiful. It's architectural design attract every one.
204,Beautiful Gateway ,Just stop by this Darwaza for some time while on your road to Bara Imambara and watch the beautiful scupture.It is a great piece of ancient work.
205,Beauty frozen in time.,Rumi darwaza is one of the famous darwaza and one of the best darwaza beautiful must watch this ek khawat hai jise na Da maula usa de ashf ud daulah
206,GREAT PIECE OF ARCHITECTURE A SYMBOL OF OLD LUCKNOW,The whole area in & around is poorly maintained. Does not give a feeling of splendour it once was. Needs a major overhaul.
207,Shaan of lucknow,we drove past this both during the day and night and it is simply magnificent! loved the detailing and architecture! it has a lovely charm to itself.
208,emblem of lucknow,"This is a huge monument right next to the Bara Imambara. You can walk to the mammoth gate. no tickets, not gates. Traffic uses the gate so you need to hop on and off the road a bit. The structure is humongous and beautiful. For history buffs, there enough to read and learn about the place, but for a regular tourist it may not amount to much except for a few pictures."
209,Great structure,This gate is integrated with Bada imambara. you can reach to the top of this gate. sun set is famous from this place. River bank is very close to it
210,big attraction,"Its transit for small vehicles, yet its must visit. Best if you can step out and behold ancient beauty."
211,Ok,"must visit - beautiful, lovely architecture though not well maintained or preserved. Tourism and Archaeology go hand in hand - need to preserve and showcase our monuments and culture"
212,Historical Place,A drive around this age old gate was worth the money. The rich history associated with the place is an eye opener to many unknown facts.
213,An example of the fine architectural style of Awadh,The Darwaja is located next to the Bara Imambara. It presents different views from the front and the back . The area around is not well maintained. A road passes through it .
214, Really big ,cobbled streets leading to the Rumi darwaza gives it an old world feel.....must climb up and see the views towards bara and chhota inambara
215,A door leading no where...,The Rumi Darwaza is near the bada imambara and is an imposing gate. While there was a lot of road work being done when I visited the monument still retains its glory.
216,Visit on visiting bada imambara,"If you are visiting bara Imambara, you can visit Rumo darwaza also since it is 100 m from bara Imambara. Good architectural work."
217,A grand monument of Lucknow,Breathtaking beauty but amidst a busy roadside . Have to be careful regarding the traffic especially during rush hours
218,Piece of History,Situated near Bada imambara. Person going to chota imambara after visiting Bada imambara will pass under this gate.
219,Great place of tourist interest...,The Rumi gate is still in use and the road is busy and active. Unless you go at dawn its hard to get a close look at it. It is stunning
220,Rumi Darwaza,"Rumi Darwaja is part of the complex housing Bada Imambara and Chhota Imambara and on the passage from one to the other. It had one main arch and two side arches, meant for passage of elephants and horses during the Nawab rulers."
221,In ruins,This is a great gate the work which has gone into it is amazing and is certainly worth a visit but not for long otherwise you could get knocked down.
222,Stand at a Distance and Watch,"Next to imambara, enjoy a tonga ride to see the durwaza , cobbled pathway makes an interesting pathway. People are nice , do do engage a guide as well"
223,Majestic,this is just next to imambara. it looks like a neck of suit. It is a must see and remember to get picture clicke.
224,Not just a gate!,"Lukhnow has too many Mugal darwaja like this. We passed many times through Rumi Darwaja, not noticed it because you see several of them around bada imamabara."
225,Rumi darwaza,You can walk from Chota Imambara via Rumi Gate to Bara Imambara. It has too many cars parked in front but it is a beautiful gate.
226,Old gate to Lucknow,this is a main gate for entry to the bazar and also to the imambara.the detailing is great but in the chaos it is impossible to stop and see properly .hope the govt can find an alternative route for the traffic so tourists can stop and take a closer look .
227,Monument worth a look,"It is a very spectacular arch, but the building is spread over an enormous road so it’s hard to really take it in. On the other hand, it’s between two tourist sights so you’re going to see it anyway."
228,Awadhi style architecture,"This gate is a passing point for vehicles and when you pass underneath it, it feels magical.It also looks amazing during sun sets"
229,A gateway so imposing,It is one of the best places and if you visit Imambara you get to see this for free as this is on the road and if you cross and go towardsThankurganj you can see Small Imambara and Clock tower as well.
230,"Rumi Darwaza, Lucknow","Rumi Darwaza is synonymous with Lucknow, capital of a northern Indian state - Uttar Pradesh. It symbolises empathy and is legacy of Nawabs of Awadh."
231,Good but not maintained,Not worth  a place to visit. Just see the pic here which is much better than what it actually is-must be of its good old days!!
232,Rumi the Poet@Lucknow,"very beautifully design gate from one side its looks like three story building on otherside its looks like one story, if you look gate upside down its famous embroidery for most of lucknowie kurtas."
233,Interesting gate,Another attraction in lucknow next to bara Imambara dhdvdhdbdjdbskidgsbdjduhhdhhdjhjdjdjdbdhdhdvhdud.
234,Best place in Lucknow ,Very grand... especially if you can imagine a train of elephants and mounted soldiers entering the city in old history... a must stop by
235,Very nice,The Arch is synonomous with Lucknow & is modelled on one of Istanbul's gates to Asia Minor. It was constructed under the auspices of Nawab Asaf-ud-daula 7 straddles the road neat the Bara Imambara. As well as being of massive dimensions it is host to some beautiful carvings.
236,Beautiful,"Visited this popular site during a business visit recently, as usual got disappointed with the way we treat our heritage and our tourist attractions! Due to which it is just a grand entrance gate; ofcourse it is magnificent and grand and worth seeing and all, but needs upkeep of area and this monument. In few years time it may be gone at this rate of traffic and abuse."
237,A door to pass through,In every city a gateway. And this is a piece of Rome in India . Entering into the land of the nawabs
238,Lovely ,This place has an environmental benefit rather than anything. Here you can learn the historical legacy of the city while visiting to different parks and sit thrus that give you peace and relaxation.
239,grandeur,"my experience was great, i roamed all around the area which was surrounded with epic things. lovable place to shop for cheap and ethnic stuffs."
240,Gigantic Door acting like Gateway,Rumi gate has been built by emperor of Muslim but they had made route for up and down through old rumi gate with look of wonderful underpass
241,Gateway of Lucknow,A good photo stop after you come out of the Bara Imambara. Traffic outside is very busy so one has very little time to admire this huge gate. One can still visualise the Nawab and his entourage passing through this gate.
242,Good example of Awadh Architecture,"Lucknow 's identity is rumi darwaza. If you are visiting Lko and do not visit Rumi Darwaza, your visit is incomplete . It is one of those historical monuments which are associated with the name... Lucknow."
243,Rnmi Darwaza just a pass way,"This was build towards the end of 18th Century by the Nawab of Lucknow - Asaf Ud Daula.  During the British period, the monument marked the entrance to Lucknow city but as the city of Lucknow has expanded a lot by today, it now marks the gateway to old city of Lucknow. The gateway is very beautiful architected. The intricate carvings and detailed design is very impressive. The fine art of the artisans of 18th Century who built it is quite appreciable."
244,Big grand darwaza,"Only if ur local guise creates interest by the history of the architecture of the gate, it will create a buzz, else it is just another pass way to the imamabra in old city."
245,Great Awadhi architecture.,The rumi darwaza is a gateway situated between the Bada imamdar and the Chotta Imamdar and is very close to the Clock tower. It was earlier used as an entrance to the old Lucknow city and is a example of typical awadhi architecture
246,good visit,A good place where you can have a glimpse of how Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose used to live in his huge masion.
247,Beautiful Architectural Angle with History,You can travel on e rickshaw and visit all sites nearby but please beware of guides of rickshaw drivers who want you to divert from your plan and take you to particular shop of lakhnawi clothes.
248,it is gate of art,"It's an ancient gate which has nothing interesting to offer. Not worth making a trip to go see it. In fact I had crossed it before,when going to some other place and didn't give it a look ( as there's nothing to see in it ). When I went to have a look at the Rumi Darwaza , I was like ""what ,we've come to see this ""."
249,Vintage paradise...!!!,Located next to Bara Imambara and clock tower. A grt architecure as one side has three floors and the other facade has one huge door shape.
250,Nice Arc,"Today i saw rumi darwaza and now i can say muskuraiye aap lucknow me hain, awesome ancient architecture, darwaza nawabi😍😎"
251,Beautifully constructed,This part of history is reminiscent of the magnanimous construction do e in our past. While soaking in the sights u can only imagine the beauty of this place when  it was at its peak
252,Our very own Grand Door!,Mix of styles best seen at night when the crazy traffic is eased off. Mind you watching 4 lanes of traffic fit through those gates is entertaining.well worth the visit
253,The face of Lucknow,"it just a grand old door sitting in middle of a street, with some extended walls on either side... most of which is falling apart.."
254,Visit to Old Lucknow,it is a really good its so big i thing 30-40 fit but working of design on it is nice in gate 3 inter point ..
255,Lucknow Gate,After completing a great tour of Bara Imambara my cousins took me to the Museum and on the way there we went through this beautiful historical gate.  It was a treat to see this beautiful gate and learning the history.
256,Impressive structure! ,Not really a stop and walk around type place but interesting architecture.  Well worth stopping for a quick photo
257,Just a doreway,"Love at first sight. Rumi darwaza just stole my heart. An architectural beauty, with one darwaza / gate on one side opens onto the other side as a four floor, three gates darwaza. So gorgeous. January 2017. #lucknowdiaries #rumidarwaza #ilovebeautifulbuildings #historicalplaces #architecturedesign"
258,good architecture,As you pass beneath the huge gateway it cries out loud with all the historical facts and figures who had actually been through the passage. Though it stands guarding the entrance of bara imambara it's sincerely needs attention from geological survey in order to preserve the history it beholds. Impressive work.
259,"Great architecture, very Lucknow-ish",It's a beautifully built door on the middle of the road and seemed nice to drive through it. The road is extremely wide and we'll maintained. I would suggest you to avoid the private guides who'll just not stop following you and would give inaccurate facts about this place. It's better you visit this place without one. The private guides here are a scam.
260,Rumi Gate,Very close to bara imambara....... Its just a gateway on the road... no entry feesGood architectural design...... other than taking photos there is no other activity.... half an hour is more than enough
261,Good Architecture,"It is simply a door. However, take a 50 bucks worth tonga ride which is totally worth it. The driver will show you the places and be your tour guide as well. Tonga ride is a horse ride."
262,A grand Darwaza..  Upcoming place,the entire gate when seen upside down it shows how the neck designs of the kurtas started. its just a gate in the heritage area of Lucknow next to the Bara and Chota imambaras
263,one time visit,It Is ok place not too good not to bed .just go through.it is on a busy road so you don't have more time to see near by
264,Western entry point in the city,You will miss the Grandeur if you DO NOT watch it by standing on the road at a distance from the Darwaza.
265,A lovely gateway,"We visited this along a list of other attractions when we landed at Bada Imambara. The private guides out there will take you along a 1.5 km journey from Rumi Gate, to Clock Tower and over the Gomti river front. They will say they are taking you to show how Chikan(embroidery) is done, but they will just take you to a shop, which sells finished goods.The Rumi Gate is huge - the front and back designs are completely different. You'll find many vehicles stopped on the side, with groups of friends taking photos."
266,Iconic spot at lucknow,"What a view! It's majestic, standing right in the middle of the road! With traffic all around, it stands tall to the Shia traditions of Lucknow"
267,Must watch in Lucknow ,"Sometimes known as the Turkish Gate, as it is said to be identical in design to an ancient gateway in Constantinople. A huge city gate, very ornate, it used to mark the entrance to the City of Lucknow, and is now symbolic of that city. Like other monuments nearby, it was built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula to give employment during a famine in 1784.The dome of the roof used to lift up, and the spouts around the archway were designed to spray water out. It was certainly designed to be eye-catching!"
268,Gatway of Lucknow,"It is said to be identical in design to an ancient portal at Constantinople in Turkey and is also referred to as Turkish Gate. It is a huge ornate structure, marked by an eight faceted chhatri in its uppermost part. In earlier times it was used to mark the entrance to the Old Lucknow City. It is now adopted as a symbol of the city of Lucknow. The Rumi Darwaza goes upto a staggering height of 60 feet. The uppermost part of Rumi Darwaza comprises of an octagonal Chatri (Umbrella) carved beautifully that can be accessed by a staircase. The word ""Rumi"" is derived from the modern day Rome that used to be Istanbul, the capital city of Eastern Roman Empire. The Rumi Darwaza is one of the finest gateways that has been built in Lucknow and is highly inspired by a similar gateway in Istanbul.On top of the Rumi Darwaza was kept a huge lantern that would light up the structure at night making it look absolutely fabulous"
269,Nice Gate and looks very good. Its symbol of Lucknow. Must Watch,"Marvellous architecture. Best visited in twilight time. Take a horse carriage tour and visit the nearby small shops, some bargains there."
270,Persian Influence,"The Rumi Darwaza is a gateway that links the Bara and Chota Imambara. On one side is the Bara Imambara, and on the other side is the Chota Imambara, Chattar Manzil, Hussainabad Clock Tower and Picture Gallery."
271,Big gate good to pass here,"We stayed very near to Rumi Darwaza, and thus able to see it at different times - in the early morning, in the late evening and during a sunny day. I was visit worthy."
272,Symbol of lucknow,"From the Bara Imambara, we hopped onto a tanga, & made our way to the Rumi Darwaza. Our excitement was doubled with our first horse carriage ride & the grand gateway ahead of us.The Rumi Darwaza is a gateway built under the patronage of the same Nawab & in the same year as the Bara Imambara. The front facade is a fine, fine example of Awadhi architecture!As it's an operational gateway, you've to be careful of traffic. There's no ticket to see the Rumi Darwaza."
273,Beautiful,Can be viewed from the Bara Imambara entrance. A walking distance of 50 meters only. It is only a gate through which traffic flows through out the day. You cannot go to the top. Has history as it is built in 18th century
274,Great piece of ancient architecture,"very good view from distance and it is main entrance to old city, here also to see making so good might be artitect from Rome thats why it is called Romi Darwaza"
275,Magnificent,we passed there in our car+driver+guide as part of our tour and we took some photos but did not get down.
276,Old City,"It's a city gateway. One can see it while driving by. Would make a good photo op, but for the crowds."
277,Waste of effort,Best to pass through in a cycle rickshaw. Negotiate for the price as they may ask for exorbitant price.
278,Superbbb !!!!,Beautiful.... especially in the night brightly lit up.... the icon of Lucknow... and now recently laid stone block road around this area... gives feel of old memories ....
279,Imposing Gate to Lucknow ,The Rumi Darwaza also known as the Turkish Gate built byNawab Asaf-Ud-dowlah in 1784.in Awadhi style  architecture.and is situated adjacent to the Bada Imambara   It is a nice piece of architectural monument to watch
280,Poorly maintained,We had a good look around and were amazed at the sheer scale of this building.  Well worth the cruise by at the least!  YMMV
281,Gate way to Lucknow,"Runi Darwaza - Rumi is not for the romatic sufi poet from Iran/Turkey, but for a gate which has Roman architecture.It is an elegant gate, abd riding in a Tonga (Ghodagadi) givews some special views."
282,just a huge door,This is a site to see and photograph. You will be enamoured by the beauty and detailed engraving of the gate. This is a must see.
283,Excellent Place and a Landmark of Lucknow.,"It is beautiful, and no matter how many times you pass by it you will click pictures cause it is Beautiful!Has parks near to it, it is right next to Bara Imambara and you cannot miss its presence!"
284,Gorgeous Gate in middle of chaos,A grand gateway in the middle of the city. Pass through it in a horse-drawn carriage to get a feel of the old days. Recommended to go after sunset and take a stroll in the area. The architecture is worth standing and admiring
285,Between both the Imambara,Our visit was truly enjoyable because of the peaceful and serene setting that punctuated the backdrop
286,Architectural Gate,Caught sight of this on a drive by - looks so magnificent. Need to read up on the history though. Just plain beautiful!!!
287,LUCKNOW ,It is so beautiful but you cant really get off to see it.Should try early morning I guess. Still would love to see a sound and light show here or at Bada imambara
288,Nice architectural work,Worth the visit ... no fees as the traffic drives through it. Get a local tour guide to give you the background info
289,A door with beautiful design,We are just chilling out and riding the bikes through it it's kind of old but the pic is clicked by me ..and have fun ✌🏻
290,Beautiful,Copied from the original  Istanbul. It's name relates to Rome. The ruler of the time wished to copy some of the great architectural sights of his time. Fine example.
291,The Grand door way,"By the time we reached here, we were very tired and we just stopped for a few pictures. It is a massive construction and it is good to see that vehicles pass through it."
292,Historical place.,u do need someone to actually tell u its significance. Else you will just mistake it to be one of the the other monuments here
293,Nice view for architecture lovers,"Called the city's ""signature structure,"" the Rumi (""Turkish"" or ""Rome"") Gate is marks the entrance into the city on the road from Delhi. This classic mughal arch is adorned with a wreath of flowers and other features worth examining from the plaza to the west."
294,Historical Place,"The guide kept on trying to show only one gate from the other side, but the right angle was never reached :) Perhaps a passing by visit during the travel from bada imamwaada to chita imamwaada would suffice."
295,Rumi Darwaza,"The Rumi Darwaza (Hindi: रूमी दरवाज़ा, Urdu: رومی دروازه, and sometimes known as the Turkish Gate), in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India, is an imposing gateway which was built under the patronage of Nawab Asaf-Ud-daulain 1784.[1] It is an example of Awadhi architecture.[1] The Rumi Darwaza, which stands sixty feet tall,[2] was modeled (1784) after the Sublime Porte (Bab-iHümayun) in Istanbul.[3].                     Rumi Darwaza in Lucknow During summer days at mid afternoon, when sun is top right up. Generally it's very busy lane, just during the Ramzan prayer time seems this place so vacant.LocationLucknow, Uttar Pradesh, IndiaHeight18 m (60 ft)Built1784Architectural style(s)Mughal architectureLocation in eastern Uttar Pradesh, IndiaIt is adjacent to the Asafi Imambara in Lucknow and has become a logo for the city of Lucknow. It used to mark the entrance to Old Lucknow City, but as the City of Nawabs grew and expanded, it was later used as an entrance to a palace which was later demolished by the British insurgents."
296,Unmatched architectural style,Lovely... Take a guided tour.. the anecdotes shared by the guides leave you in awe.. Definitely worth a visit...
297,one of the famous landmark,The carvings are beautiful  but that's about it. Pass under it a couple of times and click a few pictures and that's about it
298,A marvelous Darwaza,You can only drive through and stop the car long enough to take pictures and appreciate what it must have been like to enter the city through it. It is impressive enough nowadays
299,Great bit of history,"At times when the sun is not scorching, preferably around dawn or dusk, you would simply love to stare at the architecture, ignoring surrounding crowd or traffic."
