0,Many interesting stories surrounding the Ruins of St. Paul’s,"One of them is the Ruins of St. Paul’s. It was built between 1602 and 1640, by Jesuits. At the time, it was one of the biggest catholic churches in China. Today, you will be able to visit the Church and the College dedicated to St. Paul. Half of the structure was burnt in 1835, but the front of the building stands tall to this day and it was an astonishing sight. Symbolism for the Holy Trinity is carved at the top. Depicting the sun, the moon, and the stars are one of the many elements of architectural interest on top of the facade. The most prominent of all is the statue of Jesus underneath these symbols. It combines a lot of elements from western and eastern architecture, since people from many different ethnicities, such as Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Italians, were involved in the building process.   There are many interesting stories surrounding the Ruins of St. Paul’s and the one I found the most interesting talks of a tunnel connecting St. Paul’s Church to the inner harbor. It is one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World and was part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, in 2005."
1,The detailed features of this surviving façade indicate the World indeed lost a most magnificent Church due to fire.,Finally we made it to the Ruin of St Paul's Roman Cathoric Church which was built in 1602 and destroyed by fire in 1635. The granite facade is all that remains of the Church and is now Macau's most famous landmark. This remains is a World Heritage and a must go attraction in Macau. Packed with tourists and difficult to get a nice view for picture. There is a public toilet nearby and many shops line the alley/small road leading to the remains.
2,Pilgrimage,Only the facade remains of this 17th century church built by Jesuit priests from Portugal. This is of course the poster boy of Macau and it is crowded with tourists and locals. Other than the facade there is nothing to see other than a crypt of a priest.The Macau Museum is uphill from this place.
3,St.Pauls ruins at Macau,Church of Mater Dei which was built between 1602-1640 was destroyed by fire in 1835 and only the facade remains today. Great area to visit and easy and free bus service to Star World hotel from main hotels near Galaxy.Plan a full day
4,UNESCO World  Heritage ,"The marble facade of the city's cathedral (the rest of the church has been demolished) on a hill in the city, a UNESCO monument. The surrounding area is beautifully restored with a paved and wide scale, while there are several shops around the base."
5,Top Destination,"The ruins of St Paul's are not only well preserved but, exceptionally popular. This place was filled with tourists at all hours of the day."
6,Amazing Place!,"The ruins of St Paul’s needs to be considered as one location in the historic part of the city. By itself, it is probably not worth the visit. When you consider all the other historic buildings, it make for a nice day out if is not too crowded. Wear good walking shoes because there is a lot of cobblestone and inclined sidewalks. If it is hot, carry water."
7,Suggestive place.,"It was built in 1602 but ruined by fire. Only the elevation is remained after the big fire. As there is long staircase in front of the elevation, you can take a good typical photo there. Don’t miss the displays underground to indicate its history. There are many old stalls around the ruins, enjoy the leisure old city walk."
8,Famous Facade,"is this beautiful facade with 68 stone steps leading up to it. It's the only part left of a Catholic church built in the 1600's and dedicated to St Paul the Apostle It was destroyed by a fire in a typhoon in 1835. It was dangerously leaning and considered to be demolished, but was restored by the Macau government and has been reinforced.All of the historic centre of Macau is UNESCO site. It is very crowded on the steps with everyone trying to get their photos taken but it is still very much worth wandering over to see. The architecture of this facade is breathtaking."
9,Nice ,"This is just the facade of a church that was destroyed by fire in 1835 but it is one of Macau's landmarks and, therefore, worth the visit!"
10,Fascinating,"This Catholic Church of St. Paul was burnt down, leaving only the facade, most of the foundations and the front steps.  The facade displays a special mix of eastern and western styles, symbolically as an altar to the city in front of Company of Jesus Square.  Advice to go early to avoid the crowds and beat the heat."
11,Day 1 Macau ,"Its Ruins of St. Paul cathedral. When we visited, it was under renovation. Though a very busy place given the density of tourism in Macau, its one of the few places to visit!! Do try the original Egg Tart on the way back!!"
12,Picture perfect!,"The cathedral burned down in 1834(?)— but visiting it for the view and the iconic steps is a quick must.  As this was a return visit to Macau, we hired a taxi to make quick stops here, at the Protestant cemetery and the lighthouse and saved a lot of suffering in the heat for $20 US"
13,Ruins of 16th Century,"The facade ruins have been preserved over centuries, fortunately. The facade still stands but with some support. It is easily seen from many angles and of course, well photographed.However, it is sometimes difficult to get a good shot of the facade without having so many people in the foreground taking photos and selphies.There are numerous shops nearby selling various souvenirs. Well worth a visit."
14,"No review needed, of course it is a MUST GO","I wish I could go back in time and been there when it was built from 1602 to 1640 by the Jesuits.  At one time, it was one of the largest Catholic churches in Asia.  It was destroyed by a fire during a typhoon in 1835.  The ruins are comprised of the southern stone façade, carved between 1620 and 1627, by Japanese Christians in exile from their homeland together with Chinese supervised by Italian Jesuit Carlo Spinola who had established St. Paul."
15,Presently very quiet due to the Coronavirus Outbreak,The Ruins of St. Paul is the most recognizable landmark in Macau.  It’s also next to the Macau museum.
16,A great relic of the past,"The ruins of the church of Saint Paul are spectacular! There are several reasons why the church is unique in the world. Only its façade stands up. The façade is large and very thin and the views of it from the hills close by are impressive! It is surrounded by a Chinese atmosphere. It was built by some of the first catholic Japanese people who escape from the Tokugawa prosecution.It has a nice museum that like the church is free. It tells the story of Christianity in the far east. The museum has representations of the archangel Michael as a samurai and some of the first Japanese Christians that were crucified in Nagasaki. Saint Paul is the altar of Macau!It is very clean and safe. It is very photogenic. It is crowded. However, the crowds were not overwhelming. This is the icon of Macau."
17,Iconic & picturesque ,"The Ruins of St.Paul's are one of the most symbolic places in Macau. The façade of a burnt church, on the top of impressive stairs, opens to the sky. Nearby, one of the most ancient Chinese temples of Macao. There is no better icon for the Portuguese 500 years presence. Too many tourists, though, make it difficult to access it. Try to go there in the evening or even at night, to get a glimpse of this unique token of Macao's Portuguese heritage."
18,Great peace of history,The history of this monument is detailed in the museum in the basement.  There is also a small temple on the left side.  The two together illustrate how two cultures/religions coexist in Macau for more than four hundred years.
19,Too Many People for One Big Wall of an Old Building,"While the ruins are limited to a single wall of the former cathedral, the atmosphere of this place is fantastic. It can be viewed as more of an experience rather than a single point to be visited. The main streets leading to the former cathedral are crowded with people shopping, old buildings, some of them quite decrepit, smells of spices, noise, stalls selling custard tarts and pork fillets. It's really hard to describe, but the vibe is awesome."
20,Mostly a photo opp only...,"The place was nice and historical. The face of the church still perfect.Many tourists came to this spot , sometimes irritating as they are speak very loud and screaming sometimes.But still, this place is a must to visit when you landed in Macau."
21,Ruins,"The facade is all that remains of the church. Our guide told us that the ruins are considered a miracle as the church burned down three times, has been hit by typhoons, and the facade remained after each fire/typhoon.  We approached from the rear and then had the choice of walking down the street or stairs, instead of going uphill!  It, and the area around, was quite busy, even though it was a weekday.  We were warned to keep our bags in front of us while walking down the adjoining street."
22,Not many to see,This is the place everyone associates with Macau. Only one wall remains ( the rest burnt down 200  years ago) but the in situ archaeology has been well displayed to give you an idea of its former glory. Right in the heart of the old town of is a great place to begin.
23,Wonderful,"A remain of the Main cathedral that was left from the Portuguese era , not really much to see at that part of the old town . Unless you want to explore the old town with history of the Portuguese missionary era , and to stroll around for a couple of hours between the small streets ,"
24,It's ok,The ruins are little more than the facade of a church and in the back a few very small exhibits. But it is right next to the Macau museum and fortress so it makes to walk by and enjoy for 15 or 20 minutes as part of a half or full day walk of the sites in the historical section of town
25,It’s a nice place,"Ruins of St Paul is signature tourist site in MacauThere are many shops associated with the path to this site. Lots of dried beef n pork, almond cake and souvenirs.Take a photo with its background an walk around the old Portuguese buildings"
26,42 Years Later,The is the most well-known iconic of Macao. It has the combination of historical building and tourist attraction place but too many people . The day we visited was great and walking distance to the nearby tourist areas. Good for taking photos.
27,A quintessential Macau photo opportunity,"Perhaps Macau’s most famous landmark, the Ruins of St. Paul’s, located at the top of a small hill. It attracts plentiful visitors, the place was really crowded. It is officially listed as part of the Historic Centre of Macau by UNESCO. However, now one can see only the remains of a beautiful old church. Due to its rich history, it’s worth a visit, when in Macau, but really not much to do except watching the ruins, some photo ops and may be stroll through the adjoining narrow streets & shops for some casual shopping of souvenir, cookies etc."
28,Good place to see but need to be careful,There really isn't much to do - the ruins (basically a wall with frescoes) are nice. place was crowded when we went
29,Nothing special,"Ruins of St. Paul's is a major landmark of Macau, and at least we can visit once. It will take you to a place, that is away from the concrete jungle, for some time. Visited during the afternoon, and hence missed the light show in the evening."
30,Icon of Macau - Ruin of St Paul,This place has its own historical interest. Well maintained with a small museum in the basement. The Macau top climb is also starting from this place. Overall a nice experience.
31,Ruins of St. Paul’s,"One of the highlights of visiting Macau is the Ruins of St. Paul.The Ruins of St Paul's is one of the must visit place when you are here. The place was crowded during the afternoon and night . When you visit the place,please try to buy and eat the Portuguese egg tart."
32,historical place,"The facade of St Paul’s is all that remains of the church that was bombed in the Second World War, it serves as a reminder of resilience against the terrors. Very touching and a must visit."
33,"Place for the ""I was in Macau"" shot",I was surprised by the amount of historical art you can see under the leftovers of the Ruins of St. Paul's. I like this area and highly recommend this spot to those who like history.
34,Landmark attraction ,"The ruins of St. Paul’s is a smaller ruin , but definitely a must see in Macau. It’s not strenuous and very nice picture for sure.. Go early to avoid the crowds (and the heat in the summer)"
35,The way is the goal,"The Church of Mater Dei, informally known as the Ruins of St. Paul's, has long been the most famous landmark in Macau. Originally built between 1602-1640, the church dominated the Macau landscape for two centuries until it was destroyed alongside St. Paul's College during the Great fire of 1835. After the fire, all that remained was the stone facade. The church was never rebuilt, leaving us with the landmark that we have today. In addition to taking in views of this famous World Heritage in Macau, visitors can also visit the small Sacred Art Museum and Crypt situated at the back of the Ruins. The crypt was only rediscovered during excavation work in 1990-95. Other World Heritage attractions surround the Ruins including tiny Na Tcha Temple, the small section of the Old City Wall and Monte Forte. These can all be visited conveniently before or after seeing the Ruins of St. Paul. Note: You can see the Ruins 24 hours a day. However, you can only enter the interior to see the foundations and the Sacred Art Museum from 9am to 6pm daily (free entry). Note: This is where the famous Dragon Parade begins at the start of the Chinese New Year. The dragon performers famously line the steps in front of the Ruins, a real sight to see, before the eye-dotting ceremony and the start of the parade. They then descend and begin the journey through the Historic Centre of Macau. Note: The Ruins are often used during Macau's seasonal light festivals and other festivities which make sue of LED projections. At night, the projections light up the Ruins with creative and interesting short programmes. These can be interesting to see when taking place."
36,Portugal fun,"This is the façade that remains from this church burning down many times over the last few hundred years. Finally, they just stopped rebuilding it. You can't miss it during a walk around old Macau and the site is near a place taxis will often drop you off. Great for a variety of pictures looking down on old Macau"
37,Nice place to visit with many shops along the way,"Not much is left, but there is a wall depicting a building that once stood there. The cave which you can go into isn't that interesting."
38,FIRST POINT TO ACCESS THE TRUE MACAU,"The impressive façade of the remains of Saint Paul's and it's ability to attract huge crowds of visitors would likely surprise the architects from nearly 300 years ago. Close examination of the carved statues and symbols on the ruins reflect a sensibility to Easter and Western traditions. When it was an entire structure, it's imposing position and dominance of surrounding buildings would have spoken not just of the power of the Church but also the colonial residents to stamp ""Europe"" on this far-flung possession. For many this is only a convenient backdrop for more photos and it's amusing to watch the posing and curious efforts to coordinate groups or bored boyfriends to work with the camera.Wander down the street below, grab a pasteis de nata from one of the many vendors or stock up on the numerous shops doing a brisk trade in meat jerky."
39,'Landmark of Macau',Long walk from the Senado Square.Very crowded and small passage thru to the Ruins.My son likes reading about history so it was still a pleasant trip.Not sure if it’s worth the trip but if you have a few hours to spare in macau. Why not.
40,Crowded But A Must!,The ruins are still there. But how could they screw things up by adding unnecesary decoration? It is already good as it is but they just ruined it.
41,iconic of Macao,"This is probably the most famous sight in Macau. While the ruins are not a special highlight, the way there and the view at the destination is the interesting thing. Starting from Senado Square, the ruins are accessible through narrow alleys (pedestrian zone) with historic houses, Chinese food stalls and shops. Tip: Turn into a side street. You will immediately find yourself in the everyday life of the Macau people without tourists. Tip: The short ascent from the ruins to Mount Fortress is worthwhile for the wide views over Macau in all directions."
42,very historical,The Ruin of St Paul is an iconic landmark in the Taipa village. You wouldn't want to miss it if you are there. Nothing much but there are plenty of visitors taking photographs.
43,Xmas visit with family,Macau is not far from Hong Kong. It is a place of old and new. Old churches with new hotels and casinos. The place is rich in history. Perfect for walking and many restaurants too.
44,Ruins of St Paul,"The ruins of St. Paul's was a 'must see' while here. Impressive surviving architecture, seen and ticked as such, as usual the experience spoiled by being jostled by, mostly, Chinese."
45,Not to be missed,"Site with historical significance, but poorly maintained streets. Chinese smoking everywhere. Coffee at nearby Portuguese coffee shop was good"
46,Unmistakeable,This remains of a one-time Church is a must visit for Macau. There is a museum below tells you about our glorified history and mistakes.
47,"2018, belated review",Impressive structure on top of a hill. I went there early morning to avoid the tour groups so it was not so crowded and I could soak up the atmosphere and have a walk around the neighbourhood.
48,A must to see in Macau,A highlight on our day trip to Macau was visiting the ruins of this once magnificent church which sits adjacent to the Mount Fortress in the centre of Macau. A very popular with tourists and locals alike so expect big crowds of people. Do yourself a favour and climb up to the top of the fort and take in some of the great views.
49,Bypass the casino and go here!,"Kudos to the authorities of Macau to preserve St. Paul’s Ruin! I am glad to see this relic as a great memory of the past. We can learn from this ruin on how Macau develop from what it is before, on how history unfolds progress in this city."
50,Nice experience,There is a light Show on the Ruins in December which is worth watching. At around 1930 and 2000 there will be several session of the light show. You can just sit on the steps of St Paul Ruins and enjoy the show with the crowds.
51,Iconic landmark,"Enjoyed the view from the top of the steps. The Ruins of St Paul's is right next to the fortress and museum of Macau so you can do them all at the same time. Senado Square is within walking distance, too."
52,Wall of ruins,Visited on a beautiful day.  Interesting facade on the hilltop.  Go from the back side.  Getting to the ruin from the front is super crowded.
53,Ruins of Saint Paul's Cathedral,"We first visited Macau in 1974 and St. Paul’s and wasn’t as crowded, didn’t have any casinos or commercial development, just a fantastic look of colonial Portugal.  Last week the crowds and tour groups were overwhelming.  But the ruins were still impressive.  The government has made some nice visual information plaques."
54,It's located in Central,"Visited the route of St. Paul today and had a very pleasant experience. Macau is rich in history lots to do in CB on casinos, get out there and enjoy it"
55,Landmark of Macao,Everything we hear about this place was real. The history is beautifully preserved and well maintained. The Portugese left Macao with lots of impressive architecture that brings back the colonial age. Macau is truly an impressive country and we can't help but falling in love with it. Our heart stays here.
56,Famous landmark of Macau,"One of the oldest place by the colonial time and still looks amazing, it's good to visit this place and to buy souvenir from Macao, so who ever visit Macao do not miss this Ruins St. Paul's as this one of the iconic place in Macao"
57,Ruins of St. Paul's is major landmark of Macau,Very beautiful and suggestive place.We have visited this place many times!The Ruins are very well preserved and entertained.All around there are suggestive places with plantations of flowers and other shrubs.The site has very clean and well-kept free toilets.Around the site there are welcoming places with seats to rest.
58,Nice but not special,"Getting to the ruins is half the fun. The cobblestone streets are teaming with shops, little alley ways with touches of their Portugal influences. Give it a go and enjoy the people watching!"
59,Wonderful sight in a beautiful place.,Its basically the front ruin of the church....nice for picture shots but thats it.The must see in this location are the souvenir shops..pastries...cookies...peanut products....portugese eggtarts and dried meat ....This place also has the cheapest exchange rate for Macau Pataca...
60,Light show in Dec,This is a nice old ruins of a church? Nothing too spectacular but as it's the thing to see in Macau I went. The fort is very impressive next to I with a good view
61,Historical site,"Very historical wall. A lot of tourists are taking picture of this unique wall. Behind this wall, there is a Museum of Sacred Art. It is worth to pay a visit."
62,Awesome place but too many people,"I love the facade structure. Could see some reconstruction support from the back, perhaps an initiative to preserve the architecture. There was a mini museum underneath and no entrance fee. It was very touristy, so many people. I’m not a fan of crowds so I left this place as soon as I can, but worth to pay a short visit."
63,Beautiful place and view ,"This is a quick visit, it's just the front wall left, with a small museum on the grounds behind. Too bad the rest of the place burned down 200 years ago. A few other things to do in the area, the Fort and Museum are right next door."
64,Historical site,"Beautiful site as you approach it. The view from the stairs looking down to the old town is very nice , lots of shops and and food vendors on the way to this site. It all makes it an interesting visit to this site."
65,Dirty as hell,This has to be the most iconic destination in Macau. It's amazing how the facade withstand years of weathering after the fire that destroyed the rest of the church. It can be very crowded but still worth the time spend there.
66,Great Macau day trip!,"Nice ruins in the heart of Macau. The steps in front of it are full of people during the night, and relaxing when its dark outside. Must see in Macau"
67,Best to visit weekdays ,We visit on a weekday with no bank holidays and the place was rammed.  This is very lovely as it mixes Europe with Asia but spoiled by far too many tourists crammed in a small place.  If in the area go visit but we made a special trip to Hong Kong and I don't think it was worth it.
68,The land mark of Old Macau city,"The Ruins of St. Paul's is what many people think of when you mention Macau. The ruins are quite big and imposing. However there is more than just the ruins. Behind the ruins are the crypts and some displays of relics, so just don't take photos of the front and run off."
69,beautiful,Many people regards the Ruins of St. Paul's as the equivalent of Macau. Visitors can imagine the grandeur and extravagence of the cathedral simply by seeing its facade. The only down side is the hordes of tourists around the area.
70,Macau Iconic Symbol,The front wall is all that remains after a fire. But it’s a very nice view and quite impressive where it stands guard on top of the hill. You can imagine that it must have been quite a sight in its day. And don’t miss the little temple just around the corner. Also very nice.
71,Quick visit,"The facade is very beautiful. It is huge. Pay attention to the detail, there are some statues and carvings. I went there at noon, and I believe there are hundreds of people here taking pictures. Therefore if you want to visit here tourist free, better come early in the morning."
72,Must do in Macau ,sort of crowded. love the crypt and small museum. even better if they the museum is bigger where you ca view the while history of it. so may shops near it. toilets are beside it and is clean.
73,Stunning ,One of the iconic landmark in Macau with great history.It's highly suggested to walk from the Senado Square via Macau museum where you get the best view / photo of Macau city and Ruins of St Paul's.The museum underneath the Ruin is worth to visit too.
74,Great history plaza ,"We visited here as a part of our journey to Macau, it’s a beautiful historic site and one that cannot be missed, you will only spend half an hour there having a look round as there isn’t too much left to see, however it is well worth the trip if you are nearby."
75,Visit this in Macau first,"This is the heart of Macau's old monumental ruins. Even the locals consider it a most important landmark, so tourist might as well understand why."
76,Ruins of St. Pauls Macao,Ruins of St. Paul Church is still everyone's photo spot and it was difficult to get a decent photo without the scores of tourists photobombing.  I enjoyed all the shops nearby offering free samples of pork jerkies and almond cookies.
77,Famous ruins in Macao,Just the facade of the church. Not many to be seen. Proceed to Macau Museum next to this ruin will complete the experiences.
78,Macau Highlights,So sad that this is all that is left but it is stunning and historic.  I never knew about the Portuguese influence on Macau but it is there and remains there - it is busy here but you can get some nice pics - I find this place quite peaceful even with all of the people - enjoy!
79,UNESCO World Heritage site,Crowded but a must!  This iconic structure of a by-gone era proudly stands atop a hill in the old area of Macau. Immaculate gardens and quite clean despite the hordes of tourists
80,A Macau Must,"Incredible how the facade stands tall and hardly seems affected by the years. Even on a rainy day, this immense structure takes your breath away."
81,Over rated,"The Ruins of St Paul's is one of the must visit place when you are at Macao. The place was crowded during the afternoon and night when we visited. Before you reached the ruins, there are a lot of shops selling Almond cookies. There was not much to do except to take some photos."
82,Nice place but avoid the weekend,"This is an iconic location in Macau. It is almost customary for tourists to take a photo in front of the famous remains of this ancient church.Do manage your own expectations as other than the facade and a few glass covered tombs (with only pebbles in sight), you will not find much to see or to read up on.There are plenty of souvenir and snack stores around the area."
83,Stunning bit of history,"Except the front wall and few blocks, there is nothing else, so might be disappointment. Crowds are everywhere"
84,Interesting site,It's a must see historical facade. The worst part is maneuvering through the very crowded streets to get there.  But we enjoyed the entire area.  Not much else to see in Macau since we are not huge gamblers.
85,Beautiful iconic sight,Great view over the Macau region from the ruins and interesting to learn the history surrounding St Pauls.
86,Bit of history ,"Next to Monte de Forte.Next to shopping area (no halal tasters/food). Look for merchandise shop near Starbucks, one of their staff is Indonesian.Must visit place when you are in Macau."
87,Amazing iconic site in Macau,It is a sight. But the weather was too hot and it's extremely crowded to get near the architecture. Go to the side stairways with lesser humans. You can take a better shot there.
88,Saved piece of history ?,Great reminder of Macau’s Portuguese and catholic past. Not much more than a facade but you get to see the past glory of this colony for more than 300 years. This history resonates into food and family. Follow the stairs up and taste the touristy streets around it. Good luck and enjoy!
89,Nice Photo Area,Mobbed and crowded most of the time but iconic ruins in Macau - cute Temple at the top too - try visiting at night for less crowded experience.
90,Great starting point of Macau Peninsula ,Place is nice for 2 mins. Some old houses and a church wall. Not very special. Neighbourhood is nice e.g. the lighthouse nearby
91,Best spot,One of the best place in macau also the souvenir place koikei shop beside the church is tasty.We will visit again soon here in winter season
92,Must visit just to take a picture,"It is highlighted as must see, but other than its so called history its nothing but a wall of an old church on top a crowded hill. Nothing really special"
93,Not much to see,Get some pics clicked and pose differently on the stairs in front of the monument as this is an important and most prominenet landmark of city. There are shops available right at the bottom of stairs where you can have some local egg tarts and street food to enjoy.
94,It was alright! ,"Highly recommended, it's a nice historical piece and the contrasting Western architecture makes it stand out in the city."
95,Imposing ruin wall,"As usual, it was beaming with lotsa of people. The pathway along the shops could be expanded and the roads should be more level and even for tourists to move around especially with young children and elderly."
96,An iconic landmark in Macau,Nice place and with surrounding resturants and shops..normally there are shuttles from City of dreams to and fro
97,Macau trip,This seems to be the heart of old Macao.  The ruins are striking to see from a distance and the photos of the Cathedral from up on top of the fort are stunning!  The whole area is so unique and cultural.  You must wonder around the area and soak in the one of a kind Portuguese “feel” of Old Macau.
98,Quick tour,Nice for a photo but other than that the ruins of st.pauls is quite boring. The walk there is always super crowded and Macau weather is usually too humid to enjoy this experience. If you want a nicer experience at this location then visit at night.
99,Crowded One,"It's an interesting place but it is getting run down.  None of the placards are legible anymore so you will want to do your research before you go.  The facade is still in very good shape but the entire site is packed with tourists.   I had read up on it beforehand so found it interesting but if you hadn't, it might be a bit frustrating as there is virtually no information posted there anymore."
100,very historic,"It is officially listed as part of the Historic Centre of Macau by UNESCO. Despite the structure being overcrowded with tourists, it was still an awe-inspiring sight, and remnants of the church can also be seen in the museum and the small rooms behind the structure.  You can only see the front facade and nothing more. but it's such a nice scenery, the contours, the cobbled stones reminds me of old Europe. Nice for photo shooting!"
101,Nice place,There isn’t much to see beyond the ruins but it is a nice facade to an overly crowded city.  It is kind of poetic when you think of colonization and seeing the portugues language everyone... it’s just a facade
102,Worth the wander!,Although this is an impressive ruin. Think about timing your visit as both the walk up to it and the site was very busy.
103,Nice place to take photos ,"The ruins itself are very well looked after, but the information stands are empty and run down. It's packed no matter what time you go, but that's part of the charm."
104,Part of any Macau visit,"Macau is a charming laid back colony with very well preserved architecture and food tradition with a mix of Portuguese and Chinese influence. The most famous is of course, the world renowned Ruins of St Paul Church situated in the heart of the colony amidst the modern casinos that sprout ubiquitously around the town."
105,Important icon of Macau history,"There are many people visiting this tourist spot of Macau. Thou crowded, but I think it is worth visiting and see the Ruins of St Paul church when in Macau. Recommended!"
106,A little bit of a walk,"Part of Macau's fascinating history, and in a great area near shops, cafes, small streets, views of the city, and more... definitely worth a stop!"
107,Must visit attraction in Macau ,"You can never be in Macau and not have a photo of the ruins.  So I dragged my 75 years old mother there, and to her exasperation there was nothing there to see except that wall standing where everyone had their photos taken.  Why was it popular, Beats me. But go ahead anyway and see for yourself 😅"
108,Too Crowded,At the heart of city ...this the  most iconic of macau afterthe old lisbua casino.       You should go there early in morning avoid the mainland tourist.
109,Iconic view of Macau,"We took a taxi from Venetian to the ruins, it only cost $75hk, and was well worth the trip. We wandered around the area for about 2 hours, venture past the ruins into the city, try the Portuguese egg tarts, they are delicious"
110,Must visit!!!,"It's one of the historic places of Macau and right in midst of the city markets so can easily be visited on a Macau visit. The ruins are always full of people taking selfies or families having picnic around so I guess it gets difficult to click pics here in silo but you can enjoy the artefacts inside the ruins.There's also market around where you can try the local delicacies like cookies or steaks which are more popular. You can even find some shops trying to give you free cookies to try right there at the Ruins of St. Paul's. In case you visit on a hot day which are very common in Macau, you can find few nearby parks in the area to seek shelter."
111,Quick stop for history and the view,We went early to avoid the crowds and the heat and stayed for around 30 minutes then walked to Largo Senado.
112,Someone destroyed the view,We came here for photo stop only. We also have lunch near the church and shopping around the senado square. We bought egg tart and pork chop bun near the church.
113,Nice piece of architecture,"It is just incredible and amazing how the façade of this centuries-old Catholic church has withstood the ravages of war and time, and was meticulously and expertly preserved for millions of present-day tourists to see and admire. It is just incredible and amazing how the entire church has since been destroyed and how only its façade now exists. This is without doubt one of the major attractions of Macao, truly an awesome sight to behold!"
114,A worth seeing ruin.,"Our hotel was close to the ruins so it made finding them easy. Also, Macau does a great job at signing everything and providing directions for tourists to find the ruins.  Also, you can just follow the massive crowds. Around the ruins there are signposts with history in several languages so you can learn as you wander around. The area itself is neat with many shops, restaurants, and cafes."
115,Good place,"Undoubted the best place of Macau. The history of the place is just awesome. Te structure still attracts many tourist, one can spend a good time just there."
116,Great view,"It is highly unlikely that any tourist to Macau would leave this amazing former Portuguese colony without seeing the famed Ruins of St Paul’s.   Put simply, this attraction is the Number One Icon of Macau and for many is the prime reason why they choose to organise a visit here, whether on a day trip from Hong Kong or to stay a couple of nights. My wife and I chose the latter and we stayed two nights at the Hotel Royal in Macau as part of our 18 day Asian adventure to celebrate our 40 anniversary in January 2020. On day one of our visit we walked from the Hotel to experience the historic centre of Macau and top of the agenda was to see the Ruins of St Paul’s, the famous surviving façade of the Church of Mater Dei, which was built in 1602 – 1640 but destroyed by fire in 1835, leaving just the beautiful granite church façade and the 68 stone steps leading up to the church as a timely reminder of the magnificence that had stood before.  At the back of the façade we noted that the structure is buttressed with concrete and steel such that the façade’s aesthetic integrity Is maintained.  The Ruins of St Paul's collectively comprise both the Church facade and the archaeological remains of St Paul's College, both victims of this same fire in 1835. What an imposing sight before us when we arrived at our destination.  The façade dominates the landscape measuring 23 metres across and 25.5 metres high.   Also there were just so many tourists and locals gathered on the steps leading to the façade making a most colourful scene indeed.  We felt we needed to be extra careful in looking after our valuables with so many people around, as a precaution.  An information sign near the front of the Ruins describes how the façade is subdivided into five horizontal levels that have an ascending reading order, as follows –“The insignia of the Jesuits is inscribed above the doorways of the side entrances, while the Latin name of the Church of Mater Dei meaning the ‘Mother of God’ is engraved above the central entrance.  On the level above the entrance are four bronze statues of Jesuit saints – Fransisco de Borja, Ignatius Loyola, Francis Xavier and Luis Gonzaga.  The statue of the Virgin Mary is in the next level up, flanked by a seven-headed hydra,  a skeleton, a Portuguese merchant ship and a winged demon with inscriptions in Chinese that convey biblical messages.  At both ends of this level there are Chinese lions jugging out the façade below the pinnacles.  On the next upper level, the statue of Jesus Christ as a child is located, surrounded by the passion tools.  A dove representing the Holy Spirit is found at the centre of the triangular pediment and a Latin Cross crowns the ensemble.  The overall composition presents a fusion of different influences on a local, regional and global scale.”We were so pleased to have found this information sign so that we could look more closely and marvel at these amazing detailed features, so well preserved and standing the test of time.    For us, after having admired and marvelled at the entire facade and its detailed features, we could only conclude that here, up on this hill, must surely have stood a most magnificent Church indeed until it was lost to Macau and to the World through the ravages of fire.   However, it is so wonderful that as least the Church’s façade could be saved and made available for generations of tourists and locals to appreciate and admire and for that we should all be thankful."
117,Historical,Amazing bit of history standing in the middle of the city.  Some history behind the fascia to look at.  No shade at all in the middle of the day so take hats.  Great photos from the steep stairs looking up and down.
118,Beautiful and Historic,One of the few places in macau to visit apart from casinos. Approach is through alleys with food shops that dont smell great. It was very hot and humid when i went and there is shade next to museum to relax or visit the fort next to it.
119,Beautiful but too many people,This place must be one of the most visited place in Macau. It was packed with tourist even it was a working day. Standing majestically after so many years
120,Crowded,"Visit the St Paul’s Ruins is just like traveling back in time. We can imagine how magnificent the Seminar was back then. A place not to be missed, even with the millions of visitors from around the world...!"
121,Beautiful! ,"Going to Macau, head over to Ruins of St Paul is a must. Beautiful place to take romantic pictures. Lot’s of food area too, local delights"
122,Gem of Macau,"The Ruins of St Paul's is a must see if you are in Macau. While it is quite a popular tourist attraction, the atmosphere is lovely. The architecture is beautiful and don't forget to take a walk behind the Ruins for another view."
123,Crowded but its alright,"I love Portugal and visit the colonial remains of this country, than Macau was on my list, but now I think, it was a waist of time. The ruins of church was the only thing here, to show the Portuguese heart... The streets are too Chines, Asian, nothing remain from the Portuguese feeling... nor the nata, it's fake with pudding, not an eggcream. The best part was the casinos (replicas of Las Vegas)."
124,A must visit in Macau,"Gosh, can you imagine your first visit to Macau and you did not go to the Ruins of St.Paul's??? It would only mean that you have NEVER visited Macau!It is an absolutely wonderful structure, and if you are as photo crazy as I am, you will simply go mad with tons of photographic angles to satiate your photography crave!It is a place easily accessible by public transport. Everyone knows this place, so asking around will easily get you there. Or simply follow the crowd!"
125,nice place,"History in your face. Fought over by priests. Battled over by invaders and saved by the people of Macau and their slaves who were given their freedom for their loyalty and love of their adopted cityVisit this then go up the escalator to the Monte Fortress . History of Macau from Neanderthal times. Think some of the relatives still live in Coloane village, where recently settlement sites have been found"
126,"It’s Historic, but not Exciting",The place was packed with tourists from every part of the world. The ruins is well preserved. You don’t need to hire a tourist guide as you can hear the history of the ruin in different languages just by standing there as there are many different tourist groups.
127,Must see,We went through on our way back to hotel. Was interesting to see with a nice view from the hill and its castle
128,Good photo shoot background,"one big ancient wall packed with people covering every inch of path. Still need to see for first timer. afterward, walk up to see the fort and old canon gun. some interesting spot for pictures and good place to see almost 360 of macau including the nice sunset view."
129,Good site to see wbile in Macau,"Visited during the day tour under Macau Discovery Tour, by Cotai Travel. Nothing much, just a left over church that surrounded by a lot Street food and shopping alley.  Worth to visit if you are 1st tinder at Macau."
130,Place of historical interest in Macau,"A must see in Macau. The Ruin of St Paul is a tourist icon in Macau. Definitely worth seeing, don't forget to buy a famous egg tart here at the many bakeries nearby! Gets busy in afternoon with tourists, so go early if you want to avoid crowds. Walk down to Senado Square after, admiring all the Portugese style buildings."
131,Well maintained site.,"I read a lot of history, culture etc. whenever we travel to a place, visiting Macau and this very especial landmark is just unforgettable experience!!!"
132,Quick visit,"Iconic, picturesque ruins of beautiful architecture Very nice views & surroundings At X-mass time there are life concerts on site"
133,Really Neat Must See,"A busy hot spot for Tourists, taking classic photos for social platform or for memories.I was here for the history, as i love history and mesmerize the philosophy behind every ancient structure.This place is full of reminiscence and history."
134,A must visit,"The place has literally fallen down with just the facade remaining. Needs serious renovation!Only kidding, but it is just the facade left of this beautiful old church. Always busy with plenty of tourists, the multiple steps take you up to the cathedral’s entrance. There’s an adjacent (but steep) ramp for people in wheelchairs etc. Certainly well worth a look around old Macau. Plenty of places selling yummy egg tarts nearby too!"
135,Family trip,The day we visited it was raining however there were still a lot of people there. The ruins are worth seeing and the walking trail around various other sites was interesting.There are many food vendors in the streets leading up to the ruins offering many tasty treats.
136,It worth a visit ,This monument is a place to see when your in Macao. Nice place to see however very crowded so might be difficult to catch a good picture
137,An iconic portal into the multicultural past of Macao,"Made a special journey out of our business meeting to see if this was still here. Yes, still at the centre of old Macau, like a the centre piece of an old Spanish western. Go see it it’s beautiful."
138,"Full of tourists, reminder of Portugese Empire","Fascinating piece of Portugal in China- I loved looking around the ruins and reading everything about the history of the area. Going inside is worth it.  There were some art pieces, but you could tell a few were removed for preservation.Note: There are many steps leading up, so be aware if you have issues."
139,Great historical site,"A no missed icon of Macau, China.Further in and going to the back basement, there's a Crypt with remains of priests rested in glass shelves followed through you can see beautifully crafted ornaments displayed of the Catholic church."
140,Very touristy,"Very nice place, bit touristique, after that we went to the fort to the see the sunset and it was very nice"
141,Best to visit weekdays ,A real piece of Macau's Portuguese historical roots. The view is impressive from the bottom of the stairs.
142,Macau is worth the visit.,"Well worth the climb for the breath taking view from the first Western Church in China. Rich history of mission, Christian education and inclusive artesian of both east and west. It takes some imagination from the dimensions of the ruins of the original structure that was once called the Vatican of the Far East. Best way to experience the grandeur of the St Paul's is walking down from the Monte de Forte to appreciate the top view of the ruins and the base of the building. This is Macau."
143,Nice place,"Must see sight in macua. Try seeing it from different angles such as beneath the steps, close up and from the fort beside it. Unique attraction. Definitely worth viewing."
144,Tiring but worth a visit,"We visited this historical place extra early to avoid the crowd. We went there before 7:00 AM, and fortunately got good shots - perfect for profile pictures or ig posts.Just less than an hour later, groups of tourists already came and poof! All crowded! Glad we went there early."
145,Must do,"Gods place for some nice clicks in the evening.The fort at the top is also good,do visit the fort as well."
146,"Interesting, and in a great area",Ruins of St Paul is a must visit while being in Macau because only then shall a person understand the invaluable contribution of the Portuguese rulers and what a place it should’ve been before the fire destroyed it.
147,Worth the visit,"A beautiful remnant of the good old Portuguese days remains in the heart of the city. You definitely must drop by when doing a visit to Macau, and the area has many good restaurants around to. A lovely European feel in the heart of Asia."
148,A church facade BUT scout the area for it to be a worthwhile experience!,"This is a must visit spot when visit  in Macau. This plaza has different souvenir shop, shopping place, cafe and restaurant."
149,Beautiful historical place and interesting experience,One of the top sights to see when visiting Macau. Perfect photo opportunity is actually at the bottom of the steps in the little alley opposite.
150,Mr,"Busy, but worth it. Superb bit of history in the centre of Macau! If you walk to the top of the Monte de Forte you can get some great photos of the ruins and the skyline. Also, a lot of great almond biscuits and dry meat shops in the area! They are always handing or free samples, so get tasting!"
151,Super Crowded on Sunday,A must check in landmark in Macau. Sunday is super crowded and all the nearby shops are very commercial.
152,Beautiful landscape but old,This landmark is probably what we all think of when we think of Macao. It's one of the things we flocked to see at least once. A lot of tourist groups come here so you will see tour guides with little flags. We came via taxi from our hotel in Cotai. We took some photos here and visited the museums and park nearby. It's quite enjoyable and it's a nice landmark to take photos.
153,The main attraction ,"We looked at the Ruins of St. Paul as part of our private tour of Macau.  It was pretty cool that it is the only thing left standing, and our tour guide pointed out some details on the facade and told us some stories about what they represent and whatnot.  But frankly we only spent maybe 15 minutes here, and that's really all it seems to justify.  It was pretty crowded when we were there, but it was a Sunday afternoon."
154,Great site to visit ,Was inundated with too many Mainland China Visitors. Bumper to bumper just trying to get to and climb up the stairs for pictures.
155,The Ruins,"Full of people but still can get the sense of history and culture around you. Local people are friendly. You can always find a quiet spot to taste Macau of its padt, present, and future."
156,Free for all to visit,"The place is historical.During weekends, there will be many people, so you will be squeezed by others."
157,Very hot weather but beautiful scenery,"The story behind the church is cool, and we went because it was within walking distance. But if it wasn’t I wouldn’t have gone and been perfectly happy. We went on a Tuesday and it was still very crowded. It was hot there’s no shade, and we didn’t stay long. It makes for some great pictures but isn’t worth a trip in itself."
158,Must see attraction - but very busy,"It is usually crowded, the architecture is nice but after taking a picture there is none much to see"
159,Pretty Majestic,"Visited the famous St. Paul Ruins In Macau.Stayed here for almost a month and the experience was awesome. Meeting new people, culture and learning new language."
160,Must see,Once you get out from the narrows city center ‘s street you are in front of it!!! It is amazing. No worth though climbing until the back!!!
161,Photo stop,"We went here to see the tuins but ended up spending just 15 minutes and 5 minutes looking at it and reading things that says soemthing about it and the other 10 navigating through the crowd makig sure we dont become photo bombers or simply just stepping on someone else’s dress or bumping into someone. Since we liked less crowded area, we ventured unto a park just right beside it and ended up into Macau Museum which is more quiet and a way better view."
162,My Macau Experience,"We had been to the ruins before but it is still a breathtaking sight and a wonderful photo opp. Getting there with the throngs of tourists is part of when experience. Have an egg tart while you're taking those pics and get some authentic Macau ""biscuits"" on your way out. It is a super outing.  Especially if the weather is good."
163,One of the place should be visited in macau,One of the highlights of visiting Macau is the Ruins of St. Paul. You did not see Macau if you're not going to see this historic monument. It was very fascinating and amazing preservation. I love the old architecture that was build on top of a hill. I always go to see it every time I go to Macau.
164,Glorious Past,"葡萄牙語：Ruínas da Antiga Catedral de São Paulo. The ruins of a cathedral, now a famous attraction in the center of Macau."
165,"Macau Icon, set on a hill, very photographic and a great sight to see while walking old Macau","Go during Christmas. If possible, walk, walk and walk, there are plenty of books and hidden gems to be found. Nighttime comes early but still enjoyable"
166,Not much exciting,This seemed to be quick photo stop for tourists. We were more fascinated by the beautiful cobbled rads that led to this place.
167,Icon of macau,"There is not much left , but they take good care of the rest , we had to pass some busy area to reach in to it ."
168,"Interesting, but really just a few minute attraction","Fantastic old ruins, which make the so called 'old' buildings in Australia look token by comparison. This thing is many hundreds of years old, and the restoration / stabilisation has been done very sensitively.I fear that the steps will get loved to death, much like Angkor Wat."
169,Worth a trip out to see,Whent there in the afternoon and went there at night. Both view are nice. At night its less crowded but i cant take good pictures with my phone
170,Ticked off list!,Dont miss in the old Town in Macau.. Great to see.. small resturants near by and Starbucks coffe Nice place
171,Crowded but special historical,Great place to visit. Fantastic that they restored it. Very very busy. Go early. Also check out the dirt and Senado square.
172,Be prepared for many tourists ,"Not a lot here to be honest. Not really ruins, just the facade. Very crowded with tourists. Depending from which way you access it, there may be many steps to be climb."
173,Heritage area. Between modern and old state. ,Not the biggest fan of Macau but I liked visiting that area of the city. Many shops and stalls around.
174,The symbol of portogal in the east.,As our tour guide Clara stated - if you come to Macau and haven't visited the Ruins of St Paul's you haven't been to Macao at all!  What great history and I love that we had Clara from WinWin Tours talk us through the story and history - while you could walk around and gather the story your self she gave us some background info that we would've never gotten!  What a great piece of architecture and history... but did it really survive the fire?  Let Clara share her thoughts! :)
175,One of the prominent landmark of the city,Truly worth a visit in despite of its thousands of visitors that make it one of the most crowded places in sassy Macau. Walking up and down hill and front and back the Ruins as well provide the best views.
176,One day in Macau,One place in Macau you should not miss. Pretty crowded when we went there during the holiday season. Prices in the small stores there are just similar to the prices in the malls.
177,Worth a look ,"Not really ruins as it really just the facade that is left - beautiful none the less. Very, very popular with tourists!"
178,Macau's icon logo,"War ,wind and fire this magnificent facade stood. A reminder to us that even in the times of adversaries we must remain strong and standing because all of this shall come to pass.A must visit UNESCO Heritage Site !!"
179,Macau - Nostalgic Portuguese colony,"The narrow streets leads to this place has many busy shops and you can taste many free food samples, enjoy!"
180,Historical wall,Do not forget to shop till you drop along the way headed to this iconic symbol. Shopping store and Food Store standing in a row from Entrance Gate
181,You haven't been to Macau if you don't visit the Ruins!,Took a ferry from Lantau Island to Macau. Stopped at the ruins. Very busy. Lots of people here. It was small. Not a lot left to see except for the front. Some crypts. History panels all around to learn of its existence. Would recommend stopping by to have a look.
182,Sylvia's Macau,"This is a must visit during your time in Macau, to get a sense of what it once was when the Portuguese were there several hundred years ago. While it’s only the facade left from the old church, the architecture is beautiful, and it is a wonderful spot to take pictures."
183,Must see!,The place is tourist attraction so there will be people taking photo everywhere. I recommend the place on the hill for photo shooting. And so angle will be better under shadow. It will be useful since the hot sun will makes every photos ruined.
184,All that remains...,"I went in the pouring rain...and there were still hundreds of people in front of the gate trying to get photos. So many people, all of the time. Go through the gate to see the excavations of the site, as well as the gardens to the right."
185,"One of the ""must see"" historic UNESCO sites in Macau","I recommend visiting the ruins! The view is stunning, and the history of this place very interesting!"
186,not much to see,Nic to see old areas of Macau.Botanical gardens were very attractiveGood view of ruins from the for
187,Boring and over crowded,"Beautiful rest of a church in macau ,good place for photo ,around bar and shops , u can spend a hour ."
188,Impressive structure ,We went there once while being in maco though lot of people come there to see this historical place but we did not enjoy much
189,Must see,"If you are in Macau then you should not miss going to the Ruins because this is the city s iconic attraction. With plenty of street signs to guide us, it was easy to find Senado square and the ruins. It was crowded but we were expecting this as the Ruins of St Paul=Macau as Eiffel Tower is to Paris."
190,Over crowded,Can’t say that this really impressive ! Just à façade left over and very seldom explanations when there are a few things to be noted / explained on the facade itself. Still nice... Temple right beside it.
191,Worth a Visit,"There’s a long stairs to the top. If you are unable to climb walk to the right there’s a slope to go up. On the top right side a park that lead to the Macau museum - the history of MacauAt the right bottom of St Paul, a small timepiece museum with many many good stuffs."
192,Love the place,Makes a good picture but could not understand what the big attraction was. Ok there are not many things you can see in Macau besides the casinos I guess but still. Nice spot with a view that is all.
193,Busy busy busy,"This one of the must visited place in macau, there is a lot of shop sell food or souvernir around this place. But you better take umbrella if you want to go there because no place for shelter from the rain."
194,Pretty facade ,A place that is very lovely. We took a lot of pictures here. Breathtaking view. A lot of visitors in this place everyday.
195,The landmark in the heart of the city,"Anyone would think that Macau is a city of gambling and betting, including me until I had the great opportunity to visit it and find myself surprised that this city has a lot of history. It was a Portuguese colony and is now an independent area of China. Many people speak Spanish and Portuguese, in fact the streets are in both languages and it seems that you are in a European city because of its architecture and the mix with the Chinese culture.The ruins of St. Paul are unmissable to begin your journey to the true Macau, the views from this point are impressive and despite the fire so many centuries ago, the facade remains intact."
196,Iconic,Stunning and definitely a must if in Macau. Walk up to the fortress to get some views of it from higher up. The walk is worth it
197,Classic Historic Site,We went in the evening because of a storm pouring down rain before we checked into the hotel. Do check the local weather after arrival before booking a day tour as rain is possible.
198,A Wonder!,Came here during the day and then at night. In the lead up to Christmas I understand the whole area will include a light show. It’s only part finished but the church looks fantastic all lit up. Worth the visit including the shopping lanes leading to the ruins.
199,Crowded but iconic ruins ,A must come when visit Macao but as usual very crowded even it was a Friday.  Anyway it's still a nice place to visit including shopping and have a feel of old macao.
200,crowded place,"First time to visit there with my Lil sister.  Many tourists. Lots of shops,  variety of food and snacks to try.  The St. Paul itself is worried to see.  Once in a lifetime,  must visit place. See it with ur own eyes."
201,Very nice place ,"A place you should absolutely visit when going to Macau, it is very famous amongst locals and tourists alike. There are many wonderful stores around this monument and the monument itself also holds many secrets!"
202,A high point in our day trip to Macau...,"Have been to St Paul  Ruins during my very recent trip to Macau (May 2019) as part of family vacation. Just to set the expectations right,  it is remaining ruins in true sense with just one big wall of church standing tall(with reinforcement structire extending support from back). it provides lovely view,  especially  as it was cloudy during my visit there. Just across St Paul is the busy  Macau market,  mostly selling non vegetarian food/delicacies.Being vegetarian,  couldn't try anything but till it was huzz buzz of market that fascinated me. Market has couple of soveneirs shops also,  but let me tell you if you plan to go Hongkong after Macau,  then hold your guns. Items there were almost double the price in Hongkong,  probably because this being  tourist heavy market. Overall a great memorable experience..."
203,History in the heart of the city,Pretty ruins and good for photos. Free to enter. We must have missed the guide notes because we hadn’t got a clue what we were really looking at downstairs. Not sure if there was a list downstairs so may be restrictive for people who may struggle with stairs. Allow 10mins for browsing the crypt museum.
204,A must see.,"No matter what time it was, this place is filled with tourists. And I do mean swarming with them. The night view is really pretty though. Do visit it at night if you can. I tried going at 8.30am hoping there'll be a lesser crowd, but there were already 3 tour groups there. If you want a clean shot you probably have to be there at 7am."
205,Historical,this was an excellent place tovisit was worth going there are lots of people as well there and you can get great pictures make sure you visit here !!!
206,St Paul Ruins: Scenic view! ,It has one of the best views overlooking the Macau Skyline plus its a piece of history. if you have a chance do make sure to climb up the fort beside the ruins for best view.
207,Nice top of hill place,"Had a fun walking tour by ourselves to The Ruins and we had a lot of fun , with great weather n nice food along the way , this is a to do list for all heritage lovers out there!"
208,Sightseeing tour,"A quick trip to see this place, only takes 20 minutes. Not one of the worlds great tourist attractions, but ok"
209,"A must go, and street walking up is nice","It's no doubt the number 1 tourist attraction, so be prepared for humorous numerous numerous tourists, cant complain as I was 1 of them. Try the tart at some shop around. Beware of taxi drivers overcharging. Most hotels have free shuttles to all main attractions, find this out properly before hailing a cab. Lots of stores around the ruins, souvenirs, food stuff.. etc."
210,Historic place ,"It's an interesting site, but the swarms of tourists and the lack of really anything to see other than what you can see online in pictures makes this a less than optimum place to visit.  Rather, take a couple of quick pictures and then head on up the large hill to the east and spend your time in the Macao Museum.  Inexpensive entry fee and lots of interesting history about Macao's settling and heritage."
211,Beautiful facade,I have been coming to Macau and the Ruins of St. Paul’s every few years or so for the last twenty five years. I’ve noticed that on every visit this site has gotten consistently more crowded and recently had noticed a huge influx of tourists mostly from Mainland China. On this most recent visit I did not even attempt to take any pictures with my camera because it was almost impossible to get a shot which didn’t show the sea of people. But still it was a nice place to sit on the steps while enjoying some local street food.
212,Worth a short visit,cannot get a good shot very crowded but worth the visit. its a must to visit this place when coming to macau .. don’t forget to go underground no admission fee looks like a museum very historical this place offer a lot of site seeing 🍓🍓🍓
213,Go early,Awesome place but too many people during peak period. The day we visited was great and walking distance to the nearby tourist areas.
214,Historical Masterpiece,"This one of the few historical attractions in Macau so don’t miss it There no much to see there even at the basement museum but you will enjoy the ambiance of the neighborhood.There plenty of gold,watch,dry pork meet sheets and souvenirs shops around the area so you can spend nice time there specially if the weather is good.No entry fees."
215,Magnificent facade,"Go in, take photos and get out. Maybe spend more time going around the small restaurants and shops. There's also a watch museum nearby that's very interesting, and it's free."
216,Very nice,"I'm staying at at Cotai Sands and I was told for the free shuttle bus you have to go to City of Dreams and look out for the bus to Hotel Sintra. However it will require some walking. I took at taxi (around 80-100 MOP). Take note that if you give a big note (500 HKD) it is very likely you will get MOP for the change.The key of this attraction is the outer facade of the church, the main building is burned down. Read the informational boards to find out more. There are quite a few places around to further explore thereafter."
217,Ruins St Pauls,A great day to visit and enjoy the scenery with family. On your way to the Ruins of St. Paul’s Church you can enjoy the colonial building and the famous meat goodies and traditional cookies that you can even try before buying. Most all of the food vendors allows you to have a free taste.
218,Must see,"Its nice but so crowded. Best is to go very early and be careful when  its raining, it's a bit slippery, we saw a few person slipped."
219,Ruins of St Paul - ABSOLUTE MUST,Worth a quick walk up. But far too crowded to even get a decent picture. And all those tourist shops all along the way doesn’t help
220,WORTH A VISIT,"It seemed everyone in Macau was headed here, and the crowd up the street past all the expensive food shops barely moved. It was almost as crowded on the steps to the facade, so wasn't a particularly pleasant experience. I imagine it would be a lot better if you could see it without the crowds -- if that ever happens!"
221,Crowded but worth it,A brief history lesson while paying a visit to the ruins. Lots of people around taking in the sights. Central location and lots of good places for refreshments close by.
222,TRADEMARK OF MACAU,This is awesome something never seen before but my oh my its busy place. Few steps to top and has displays at back worth a visit
223,It's beautiful,"Beautiful structure, very crowded for my taste. But the view was amazing. Highly recommend for anyone’s first time visit to Macau to learn some history."
224,strongbow,"I really enjoyed going to the ruins, you can go down in to the crypt and see some artifacts from the old cathedral. The ruins are close to the fort, and shopping areas but be careful of the pick pockets, they are about! Otherwise it is safe to walk around and enjoy. It gets very busy in the middle of the day so go early. Many restaurants and shops around the Main Street."
225,Simply Historical!,A  reak from the casinos to see a nit of culture.looks a bit out of place among the modern buildings. Nice to see
226,Remains of Church,This iconic landmark is a must to be visited. Just be a bit early since tourists tend to flock in the area.
227,Pretty cool architecture and the ruins,"Third time to visit this place. The shuttle from Venetian Hotel dropped us at Star World Hotel. Compared to our first two visit which only took us 2 minutes to reach Senado Square, this time it was a 15 min walk through the maze of streets. It was an interesting walk though. Stores, shops, hotels and restaurants lined the street which made up for the rather long sunny walk. As always there were lots of tourist. Grab some free taste of biscuits and meat along the way. Oh, the Starbucks is still there. The walk back was shorter."
228,Part of a cathedral walls in old Macau,"Beautiful iconic sight in old Macau’s city center, not to be missed on your way up from Largo do Senado to the Fortress."
229,"""NEVER MIND THE THOUSANDS ROAMING AROUND""",everytime i visit here..im amaze of how they make it so beautiful..even its hard to come here beacuse of a lot of tourist..i will still choose to come...a very beautiful GODLY place
230,Great but over run with people,"Anyine vistung macao must go there There are alot of shops aroundCheck them all but, take care of you are a muslim because the offer alot of non-halal optionsTry juices, ice creams and soEgg tart is fine as well"
231,"Fight the crowds and the extra steps, well worth it",Over-rated and very crowded with tourists. It's almost impossible go get a good shot in here. The good thing is there are lots of souvenir shops nearby and amazing food stalls.
232,Interesting monument that deserves a visit.,Iconic tourist spot worth a visit.  Just too many tourists so our photos came out looking like we belonged to a tour group instead of just the 2 of us!
233,Good,I would suggest visiting St Pauls ruins on a weekday. Sunday was very crowded and not at all comfortable. Otherwise it is worth a visit. The view of the ruins from Robuchon au Dome on the 43rd flour of the Hotel Lisbon is quite special.
234,Heritage ,"Basically, this is one of those sights that you just have to see because it’s one of the ‘sights’. It looks cool, you can take some nice pictures, but for sure, it’s a tourist spot. Start at the fort, and come down the stairs into the ruins. The dramatic part is then descending from the ruins into the crowd below. The area has some nice architecture, and if you wander the streets a bit (away from the crowd) there are some nice side streets. If you follow the crowd you’re in for a few minutes of intense pedestrian traffic that eventually dumps into a festive shopping street. It is easy to combine with a trip to the other sights, and while not necessarily something I would do on its own, it’s part of a well rounded day of historical sight-seeing."
235,Great Meeting Place,Good place to go and nearby almost other walk thru’s. Make sure to make a visit at a couple of museums nearby.
236,Busy place!!,It's a must to visit this wonderful historical place and enjoy the view of the ruins and feel the thrilling atmosphere.
237,"History, history ","I personally do feel unique even tho is only left one piece of wall but this is should be the way to treasure it, and not to repair it.If repair it, that is not the original history story left over."
238,A bit crowded but worth a visit if you're in Macau,"Went there after lunch at Parisian, it was on a hot weather, location wise, it was easy to locate the ruin as there were lots of directions in every corner. And when we got there, boy, it was really crowded. So we decided to take photos at the base of the stairs. But, it was a nice experience. Im glad there were directions and it wasnt hard to find the ruins."
239,Afternoon and night view is nice,Probably a must visit when in Macau!However walk from Star World Hotel took 20mins. Wanted to take a taxi there due to my elderly parents but got scolded by the taxi driver instead for most tourists will walk there. Taxi driver was bias against chinese only stop tge scolding when I started to speak english.Nice photo shots though with crowd in the background.Highly recommend to go up to the Monte Fort for nice overall view of the city.
240,Overcrowded and will avoid ,"An interesting and busy place to visit. You need time to really check this out. Unfortunately we did not but if you have time, take it to learn about this place. The history is incredible and there are some sights that will truly amaze you. There are so many places to see in Macau that you really need more than one day to appreciate."
241,Worth to see but not mandatory ,"It's my 3rd time seeing it. And it just looks really magical and fascinating. No wonder, it is the 1st thing a tourist MUST See when travelling to Macau.👍👍👍👍👍"
242,Very overcrowded even on a weekday,"Avoid Macau over the weekend - full of tourists, and its a nightmare to get somewhere. But Ruins are worth having a look - reminder of Portuguese Empire."
243,Landmark of Macau,This place is still worth visiting even during the night as this city is still very alive at night.  I had my concern when I visited Macau from HK and arrived at 3 pm and thinking I wouldn't be able to maximize my stay but everything worked out just fine.  Don't be afraid to explore the city even during nighttime.
244,Full of tourist,"Too many people and view is great.too hot weather of Macau,pisturique view and historical place of Macau."
245,Nice but crowded,"A day excursion can be fun here. Cheap ferry from HK, takes an hour and a bit or try new bridge linking HK to Macau - some crazy development on the Sea. Tiny Macau loves gambling. Nothing much left other than few buildings.Enjoyable walk around the city until Ruins of St Paul’s, probably one of the major attractions here.Can be fun to try some local foodies. May find usual fast food places, and some Portuguese influences. It felt safe but be cautious in crowded spaces. Don’t forget Macau seperate fromChina ( & HK). Require travel document, local currency & all."
246,A family visit,"You haven't been to Macau if you don't visit the Ruins! A must do. A visit huts the place into some context. There are many other historical sights nearby, excellent area to stroll about. Can get very busy, though."
247,Moving ruins,"This place is a must visit place no matter how many times you’ve been to Macau. The ruin of st Paul looks so majestic and sad at the same time. This time when I visit it, I saw a couple doing prewed photoshoot, it’s so romantic ;) lots of shops there, so come with empty tummy."
248,Impressive,Nice place to visit. Very well maintained. Usually crowded. Best time to visit in the evenings. Nice view from the nearby Fort.
249,Good place ,"This is a beautiful place to visit anytime of the day or night, the walk is perfect in any weather, rain or sun, lots of shops nearby selling  fruits and vegetables including ice-cream, staff all friendly and welcoming."
250,Sight seeing. ,One of the places where you only need to go once to check it off your list. Really crowded with Chinese tourists.
251,Feels like Honeymoon in ‘Europe’,Went here on a Sunday but it was so crowded we didn’t stay long. Worth the visit though including the shopping lanes leading to the ruins. Lots of history and it must have looked formidable in its heyday.
252,A must-do while in Macau,"This place is always teeming with people! It’s interesting if you can get close enough. But really, good luck taking a picture without anyone else."
253,One of Macau's Icon,"Its on the top of the list of things to see, it is a great spot to look at however it is overrun by tour buses. Getting a photo without 100 other people in it is almost impossible - it rained whilst i was there, then the steps are clear so i took a photo. so pray for a 5 minute shower for a nice clear photo of the steps and ruins. the old fort near by is worth the 5 min walk up. great views and hardly any crows. lots of small streets and bakery's near by the ruins also"
254,St Paul’s ,So many people there but good many people take photos but night time view not clear but it’s look good my friend so happy I take to them go there say nice place if have chance visit with family
255,Lovely atmosphere ,"Its my second time to visit there and it was okay. I guess when you are in Macau, its a must visit since there are not that many things to do there. I just find it weird this time why there were a lot of bunnies on the side of the steps?!"
256,Macau’s iconic monument!,This was awesome to see in person after seeing pictures of it online. It definitely gets crowded with people taking selfie’s but it’s definitely worth spending some time exploring the ruins of this Portuguese cathedral. It’s free to enter and you can even go into the little museum they have attached for free. I highly recommend it.
257,Nothing special on the surface,The weather is rather hot at this timing. So do bring along some water. Scenery is beautiful when you look from the fort down at the St. Paul ruins. A small Chinese temple besides the ruin is rather interesting.
258,Crowded.,"It's definitely worth a visit but don't plan to stay too long because apart from the ruins of the front of the church, there's nothing really there. And if you come from the City as most people do, you'll notice that besides the stairs leading up to the Church ruins, there are pretty ugly buildings just to the left, which could ""destroy"" your photo if you don't take care to avoid them with your camera. But as arguably the most photographed tourist attraction in Macau, one simply has to go there. I could imagine that the church ruins has a much bigger appeal to tourists from the Far East who are not used to these styles of churches as we are in Europe. An average rating from me."
259,Icon of Macau,"the ruins itself is just good for photospot but it has much different angle to capture. Nothing much to do with the ruins. Macau's land icon. Must visit place when you come to macau. Located near with senado square, you can do shopping or just chillin out there."
260,It strikes !!!,The place is ok for a few pics and a bit of history but nothing much else see. The surrounding area shops were too  expensive
261,a little bit of history,Nice and historical placekids can learn more about religion especially in catholic ways. And start to know a little more about portugese
262,Unique art of building,"We went there at night coz we heard it would be very hot in the morning and the crowd is too much. At night, there weren't that many tourists so we made the right choice.  Going there you could see lots of street foods. There is also a coffee shop at the beginning of the stairs so if you get tired or thirsty, you can stop by. Must see in Macau!"
263,Iconic but a bit run down,Start your Macau visit from here. Iconic symbol of the city. Have also a look of this place from the nearby castle.
264,"Iconic Place, not well looked after",We liked this place very much since we went to this place after 5.30pm they never allowed to t check the museum
265,In need of repair,"Nice place. Too many people and the weather was too hot, maybe because it was noon time. But a lot of foods. Nice place to visit."
266,I guess this is one of the sites you have to see when you go to Macau ...,We went there in the middle of the day so it was scorching hot and really crowded. Not much to see except the facade but you still get to feel the history and culture of the place.
267,Their name says it all!,"Landmark of Macau , suggested to visit in morning session to avoid crowded tourist group. Should spare time to visit attraction around such as Macau Museum ( 3 mins walks from Ruins of St. Paul's ) for nice view at roof top / visit small temple around there. Never miss egg tart and BBQ pork for your friend at home."
268,Ferry to Macau,"Once again, if you are from Europe, this is a bit underwhelming. It is the front wall of a church. The rest is missing. Plus a ton of Chinese tourists taking selfies. There are thousands of ruined churches in Europe, with hardly anyone there most of the time.I took a picture, mainly to show the amount of tourists."
269,Site of historic remains of an ancient church,"I think when you are in Macau, just need to have a quick stop for photo taking at the ruins of st paul~~"
270,Interesting... if you can get close,"We only had one day in Macau and since we were staying at the Venetian, we could have easily spent the whole day at the hotel/casino, but I wanted to see the historical center of Macau.Fortunately, the Venetian had a complimentary shuttle to the Sands and from there it was a short, inexpensive cab ride to the Ruins. Despite the effort to get there, it was well worth it. There is a free museum in the site and the next door is the Monte Fort and Macao museum so it was definitely worth the trip!"
271,A Magnificent heritage.,Nothing too exciting but a must see site if you are in Macau. Lots of people milling about but if you go early in the morning it is pretty empty.
272,Spectacular ,"I last visited Macau 42 years ago and it was a real pleasure to walk again where I had been so many years ago. Huge changes made, very little recognisable except for the ruins of St Paul and the Casino Lisboa, the only casino in those days, remained in my memory. The area around the ruin has been greatly upgraded and is a must see on your trip to Macau.If you are going to Hong Kong take the trouble to visit Macau. However hire a tourist guide, our guide, Dixon was an absolute gem. He made the trip a wonderful memory to carry with us. Friendly, kind helpful and a pleasure to be with. The cost for our tour was R1400 (US$90)  for the 2 of us. It was worth every cent and we were taken everywhere with a smile and great informative detail."
273,What you see that’s just it,"Must be top on your list while in Macao. Unfortunately you’ll need to maneuver around all the selfie, wannabe models and influencers on the stairs up to the facade."
274,A fun visit,come early morning or late afternoon otherwise u won't get pictures without the crowd of tourists ...
275,Go early to avoid crowd.,This is a must visit if you are in Macao. I enjoyed the way going to this historical site as there are lots of free taste a long the way. You’ll never go hungry.
276,Over-rated,"Your visit to Macau is wasted if you would not spare a time to visit this historical site. Spend some time, take photos and feel like you're traveling back in time."
277,Amazing,"Worth having a look whilst in Macau ,go early 9.30am two reasons beat the heat and lots of busses come in around 10-10;30"
278,Swing by on way to fortress and museum,Recommended to visit here during winter due to the overcrowded visitors. Many shops and foods options along the way
279,Photogenic ,"Worth the wander but I would go early if I were you. We went mid afternoon on a Friday. Felt like everyone else was there at the same time! Umbrellas everywhere (from other tourists), hawkers everywhere, random rabbit statues, extremely hot sun. Doesn't take too long to explore."
280,Iconic ,"Cut through the winding trail of almond cookies and other snacks to be rewarded with a photo opp at the ruins. Very crowded affair, took the obligatory shot with friends and promptly moved on."
281,Wall-to-Wall People,Had a quick visit today with my husband....found this to be a very interesting site.  Fascinating place.
282,Great historical art!,"Enjoyed this one day trip via ferry to Macau! Gave us a full day experience of the key sites of the city, which included buffet lunch at Macau Tower! I have acrophobia but it was great to be up there! We loved the historical sites of the tour as well.. The Ruins, the stairs to the ruins, the museum, even the casino (tho we didn’t gamble). It’s a must if you want to see Macao!"
283,Good place to visit,"Good place to visit if u visit in macau nice view , good market to buy cookiesPeople are crazy for take photosVery nice view park also there"
284,Cool and crowded!,"This is probably the single most recognizable landmark of Macau, so you'd be hard-pressed not to visit it if you are here for a leisure trip. The ruins is quite photogenic, though there are a lot of tourist. I visited it during the day as well as night to see the light show since it is the Macau annual Light Festival in December. There are a lot of shops and eateries in the area, so you could probably spend a few hours around here loitering."
285,A historic place in Macau,"""A journey becomes a pilgrimage as we discover, day by day, that the distance traveled is less important than the experience gained"" -Ernest Kurtz"
286,Amazing View of the City,"I came here during the weekend and i think it was the wrong time.. this place was so busy so difficult for us to enjoy this place.If you love to take picts, There is nice spot surrounded and along the way here."
287,Must see for nostalgia and history of Macau...,Never fails to impress. Macau is now my favourite place in the world. We always find time to see the sights in between the Macau Grand Prix...
288,Worth a squiz,It was nice to see I took an early morning walk getting there just before 8am and would recommend this you won’t get a picture with people around but there are some nice snaps to be had take time to walk to the right side of the ruin and up to the fort for a view across Macau and the museum below
289,How it eas,"Fly from KLIA to Macau. First time here. Its my 14 days trip KL-Macau-Guangzhou-Macau-Shanghai-XiAn-Huashan-ChengDu-ChongQing-KL.Flight SGD432 : KL-Macau, Macau-Shanghai, ChongQing-KL"
290,Tiny Macau,"Try to go as early as possible as it will be crowded after that. Walk up the stairs,  you can find a small little templr on the left side."
291,"Landmark of Macau , must visit",Never come to Macau on the weekend.  Macau has became the weekend getaway spot for the Chinese in Mainland China.  All the streets and attractions are flooded with people.  I would enjoy a lot more with less people.
292,Must visit stop for Macau visit,"I don't know it always been like that or not, but i went there and they held a festival during my trip and it was dirty as hell, the toilet is very difficult to find and very dirty. I hope the government take a verys serious care of it as so many tourists goin there"
293,Historical remains draw large crowds,"I was glad I went there, however never seen so many people in such a small area anywhere like this before and I am 60  years old now. Mainly mainland chinese who know nothing about manners and being polite so be careful or maybe arrive very early in day seems chinese do not like early things, ruins themselves and cafes in area were GREAT."
294,"Impressive, impressive, impressive...","Been here a number of times over the last ten years whenever we come to Macau. However, given that our friends were visiting Macau for the first time, we felt compelled to bring them here as it is one of the most recognisable landmark of Macau. We deliberately went on a weekday, expecting less crowd. However, the place was still overcrowded with tourists. Traffic was also very bad as there were many tour buses trying to access the small road leading to St Paul ruins. Will definitely not visit again as it was simply too challenging to navigate the small crowded place with young children."
295,Basically the front wall of a church,We visited on what was a hot and sunny day. We were able to walk around freely and explore the area. There were many if other tourists in the area when we were there. The historical fortress is very close and is also with checking out.
296,As usual very crowded place,"It was overcrowded, thus making it pretty hard to find the perfect spot to take selfies, especially when you're solo traveling. But obviously, it's a must-to-visit place in Macau!"
297,Great place,"Visited China for first time, I arrived there from Hong Kong by Speed Ferry took an hour to get there as i was staying at a hotel in Hong Kong. Macau is an ace, lovely colourful of city building and ancient building. Very busy people at St.Paul’s, long stairs but not difficult, it has beautiful garden too."
298,"Aesthetically very pleasing, good for a quick visit",If you love History this is the place to be.. u will not be disappointed.. if u are in Macau is the top attraction to visit.. Recommended!!
299,Ruins of St. Paul's,always love to come here. If you want to take photos...better come early in the morning. so you can enjoy to take it.
