0,Shurijo Castle Totally Burned,"The castle was burned last year then there is nothing to see there now, so if you go there you will lose your time."
1,Shuri castle,"The place is very small, nothing to see (except if you pay more to enter the castle), a little bit dissapointing if you asked me."
2,Awesome !!!,"The place burned to the ground a few days after we visited so, not much to see if you go now.  The good news is that it had been destroyed once before during the second world war and beautifully restored.  Hence, we know they know how to restore it.  Only a matter of time!"
3,Beautiful park - amazing castle before the fire :-(,Very cool to see the castle. There is a great lookout over the city (so go at night). There is no charge for a basic visit but you can pay to see some more specific areas inside. The castle is a bit of a hike from the monorail.
4,Very sad .....,You have to watch your route. Then you will find the way back easy! The outside of the castle is in reconstruction. Therefore no good pictures were possible to take. The park is nice and once can do a relax walk.
5,Must see in Okinawa!,"It's 110% worthwhile to visit the castle ground now, although the main castle is burned down. It was painful to see the damage, but in a big picture, this is one example of how history evolves. I believe it was meaningful for our kids to see the site as well.   It's completely…"
6,Nothing much to see as the main area was burnt down,We visit Shurijo castle again after 12 years and nothing much has changed .This place is great to know local history and the Ryukyu kingdom and how closely related they are to the Chinese empire . They are undergoing painting refurbishment now so the front part of the castle is covered with but within the castle it is still accessible .The whole place can be covered within an hour and a few areas to rest and shops for souvenirs . This place works better for family with older kids and teenagers .
7,Nice quiet place to walk around,"This used to be a very special place to visit, I cried and my heart hurt when I heard about the Castle burning down, right after the Notre Dame in Paris burnt down. What a lost to the world community. But I know that it will be restored once again for the third or fourth time during it's existance. I visited it in the 1960'sm the 1980's and finally in 2002 with my wife. Ever time I visited the Castle it had had some improvements made to it. Over time there were many historic artifacts included in the restoration. Some will be able to be replaced or duplicated due to the many pictures of the Castle that exist. And thank god that there are other artifacts in the many museums around the island. It will take many years to get it back to what it looked like in 2002 when I last visited. I was a student of Dr. Barbara Golden, who received her PHd in the history of the Ryukyuian island culture by the University of the Ryukyus. Many of the things she discovered over the 35+ years on the islands, were either kept in the Castle, at the University of the Ryukyus, or in one of the many museums affiliated with the University. She was the author of several Japanese books on the history and on the different cultures in the Ryukyuian chain of islands. One of her books, I believe was on the 27 different castles on Okinawa when there were 27 kingdoms there. I would like to visit the castle one more time before I die."
8,Still worth to see while it is under the construction!,"This is a bit of a walk from the train station, the Castle has very little inside to see, views are nice at the viewing point, if your under pressure for time this wouldn’t  be the must see place for me. On our day there was lots of scaffolding and some of the roads being dug up, would have been nice to know before paying the entrance fee."
9,World heritage!,We visited this castle very early morning and there were not many people yet there. We learnt Okinawa's history in the museaum and it was a good place to start sightseeing in Naha.
10,Historical castle,"It not pretty good and will only take around an hour or two to view the castle and castle park below the castle. Castle itself is not big, however, it still is very pretty and also the view of the city from the castle is also nice."
11,Under construction due to fire,"The main part of the castle was burnt down in a fire last year, and it will probably take some time before everything is back up again. For now, it was mainly the outer walls which are available for viewing and the garden area within the castle. Nothing really much to experience, but at least it was completely free at the moment. Not many signage or brochures to explain about the fire or history of the place, which was a let-down.The castle restaurant was open, and provided pretty good value for money food, although the food wasn’t anything to wow at. Service was pretty fast, and food was quickly served almost instantaneously after ordering."
12,After the Fire,Its good to go around and walked through this castle. This castle is not too big. I would recommend to visit this castle half a day.
13,Nice walk around,It is well worth your time to visit Shuri castle again even if you have visited before on previous trips. I travel to Okinawa annually and fins something new at the castle complex each year. This year a new pathway through the Japanese portion of the casle takes you outside onto the castle wall back of the main building for a large panoramic view of the city. There is also new history an area will be planted in chrysanthemums as was in the past. There are new exhibits and performances and you should check on the events calendar because there are night visitation of the area lite in candle light.
14,Shurijo castle in Naha Okinawa ryukyu castle,"The park and the premises were nice, unfortunately the castle burned down last year. It’s still worth a visit and easy to access."
15,I hope it can be rebuilt soon,Heard so much about the Castle and am glad we were there. We walked a while in the Castle compound then realised that we haven’t even reached the Castle entrance. You already get a good view of the area around the Castle before going into the Castle. Toured the interior of the Castle compounds with us carrying our own shoes in plastic bags given out. Thought it was quite novel. The compound was well maintained. There was a lookout area there too which we took some pictures. Worth spending a couple of hours there. Enjoyable.
16,Most Parts Open & Free. Go visit.,"It is an attraction that is worth visiting and almost every tourist that visits okinawa will visit the castle. This castle is rebuild as the original one was destroyed during the war; the castle was well made and it looked beautiful. The external areas of the castle was lovely too. My only wish was that they have kept some parts of the ruin, or showed more artifacts that might have been salvaged. This castle felt too perfect where it doesn't showcase the history that it had."
17,An amazing castle,"Visited this castle one week before it was burned down. Picture in front of the main building with the clear blue sky was beautiful. There were many historic Ryokyu information in the building, hope restore work can go on smoothly."
18,My First and Last Time ...,We enjoyed visiting the castle. Beautiful views and interesting exhibits. You have to take your shoes off and carry them with you while in the castle proper.
19,parts still open,"The short version of the story is that it is definitely worth a visit to Shurijo Castle. They have done a great job of restoring the castle and even without a lot of info in English you can still learn enough and enjoy beauty and history of the place. I would also highly recommend stopping at the tea house. It is a very nice room, the tea is quite good and the price is very reasonable. The staff are friendly and helpful... you also get to learn a little more about the history of the place. Another tip.... if you are using the monorail to get around definitely get a 1 or 2 day pass!!! This is one of the places that you get a discount if you show them your pass."
20,Historical,It lies on top of the hill and you can enjoy a fine view of the town. Good place to learn the history of the old kingdom.
21,Heartbreaking fire damage to this UNESCO World Heritage site,"Go on your own to enjoy this castle. Although it is not as grand as the famous castles of Japan, its Chinese influence is quite striking. But don't go on a wet day. Too many things will be missed. The Museum Shop had too little to offer. Not even postcards of the castle was available. You can reach the castle by monorail."
22,Red castle,We didn't know until we go there that the Castle was closed for two days. Visitors were allowed on the grounds but couldn't walk inside the castle when one normally could. We didn't see a sign about that until after hiking up a bunch of stairs (bun burning!) then saw a sign at the actual entrance of the caste courtyard that it was closed that day and the next. We didn't have time to go back so that was the extent of our visit there.
23,This was a very special place to visit.,"I was disappointed from this castle,  of course it's Hard to keep all old stuff but here,  I Font know the outside walls and the Garden really nice but the 10 Dollar Entry fee.. Than i Sponsor once more Kumamoto Castle"
24,I want to cry,"The fortress itself is under renovation, but you still can visit inside which is a blend of old and new stuff. The view from the fortress is really nice and you can take a stroll around if you have time. Its parking is indoor, if can, choose Shurijo Castle, because parking outside are quite expensive."
25,Past Glory,"It’s worth the long walk up to the Castle, beautiful gardens and building. Look out for the tea room it’s work the break"
26,Beautiful place to visit but it's gone,The place was not very big but with the stamps books we enjoyed going around the area to get all stamps.  We learnt a lots about this Castle.  
27,Worth a visit,Everything is perfect if you love the thing as history. I wonder why so crowd people come here until I went there. This place make you feel relax with all history that you got even you can't take a photo. Nice view around castle. But just a bit noisy because of the parking lot not enough for all people and sometime you have to pay around 500 yen and have to rush hour to make on time only 1.5 hours. If more than that you have to pay more for parking lot.
28,Best Thing to do in Naha,"Well, it's the place not to be missed when you are in Naha, but don't expect to be astonished with the scene. Positive things are that there is the great view of the city and performance you could see there. Can be boring for the kids."
29,Restored ryukyu castle,"It is very sad that a fire last year destroyed the castle.  I could only imagine how elegant it was.  However, if you are so inclined, you can still walk around the grounds and take pictures of the skyline from a few great photo areas.  There is quite a bit of uphill walkways so those with heart, lung or mobility issues may want to opt out of the hike and only visit the gift shop at the entry."
30,Educational Historical Site,"Even though a little part of it had burdened down still there are MORE other historical things to see at the site. Unfortunately everybody talk about the lost (which make you do NOT wanting to go) forgotten that there is other important, historical and beautiful building at castle area worth visiting. I was smart enough to know this and are very glad to say that I went there and didn't let myself get talk out it."
31,the history of Okinawa,Interesting castle that used to belong to several kings and you’re able to walk around the palace to visit the different rooms used for different purposes while learning about some history. A pretty nice place to spend the morning.
32,"Unesco World Heritage Castle, Shurijo Castle",I hope Japanese government is able to get this place rebuilt soon. It is really sad to see this place being destroyed like this.  
33,Amazing icon for the martial artist,"This was a lovely castle, it was built into the top of the hill and overlooked Naha.  There were lots of different rooms and gardens to look at and there were helpful guides in English.  You can take some photos in many areas, but some are restricted.  You have to remove your shoes and place them in a bag while inside.  It is a long walk up to the top, but worth it."
34,A lost era worth revisiting! ,"The castle has been extensively reconstructed after being pretty much destroyed during the war. This means it looks good, but there's a certain missing authenticity to it. Of course it is still well worth a visit, although I didn't bother paying to go into the inner sanctum since that didn't look very authentic at all."
35,Must visit place for all Okinawan karate-do practitioners.,I took my public transportation there. As a tip the castle is situated on top of a hill. We took a taxi there but walked down hill to Gibo station after the visit. A climb uphill would have been very challenging. A large section of the attraction is free. And there is a game to collect stamps at different parts of the castle. This is very useful to get my son to walk around with us as he wants to collect all the stamps. I really like the staff at the attraction. Really tried to be helpful. Although the original castle is destroyed they try as much as possible to restore it using historical records. Know a lot about Okinawa history from the visit.
36,Very Interesting – great views!,"Nothing really interesting here.  It's just like a simple walk on countryside with some old temples and that's it.  Perhaps the only good is the observatory deck where you get to look from a high point and see the ocean,"
37,Timeless castle that played important role in trade between China and Japan,"We took the monorail there - last station but about 15 minutes walk, and not many signages so be prepared to ask the helpful locals and the students. Historical site but our very elderly friend couldn't walk up the steps (she had joined a day trip there). Go for the interesting cultural performances (only on certain days and timings) and the evening light up. We missed the latter as it rained that evening and the guide was very strict about not letting us in through the side gate (from the university grounds)."
38,A hot day for a walk around the castle ,This is a beautiful piece of Japanese histroy - the place is vast and there is pleanty to see. We have enjoyed the archtecture as well as amazing gradens and stunning views.
39,A must see,"This is a reconstruction, since the original was destroyed during WW2. It's not any less interesting though, as it is historically significant and provides an insight to Okinawa before it was swallowed up by what we know as Japan today. Worth going, don't miss it."
40,Fun walk with the kids,The Castle was under renovation when we were there in July 2018.  Still lots to see inside. Spectacular views from the grounds.  Easy to take a cab there and catch one back to Kokusai Dori.
41,A quick glance into Ryukyu history,"The place was destroyed about 6 weeks ago but there was still some things to see here. Wasn't quite sure if I was able to get to the main area of destruction as a lot of this place was cordoned off.  Did got to see a few buildings with damage which was a bit emotional from me for some reason.  Still there are things to see here like stone gates and some buildings and whatnot.   I believe the American Air Force destroyed this place once before, and it was resilient enough to come back then, so I'm sure it will again."
42,The Majestic Shurijo Castle,"Honestly, it’s rebuilt in 1990s, feel quite new. If you go by monorail, on the way to the castle, you can see a shop selling cheaper entrance fee. Go and buy it with cheaper price. People say that you can see the panorama view from the top of the castle but nothing to see on the top. Basically, the architect of the whole city is quite flat and no interesting building. Even its history, too short and nothing special to be remarked."
43,Shuri Castle,"Take a train to the Shuri castle. If the weather permits, the walk is very pleasant and you can find eateries around.  Have an ice cream. Try Shuri soba  Otherwise, the castle is recently rebuilt. So its like going to a movie set.   Nice pleasant walk."
44,Enjoyable and educational,"Some beautiful architecture and some history....worth stopping to visit.  There are areas fo the castle that do not have an entrance fee, but to enter the actual building you will need to purchase a ticket.  Some nice photo opportunities, but not a whole lot to see."
45,Beautiful & Educational,"Stayed at Naha for 2 to 3 days before I headed to north, this place seems worth to go when I looked up in the internet where to go in Naha. Anyway, if you are not into history this is not your cup of tea. The garden and view are ok but I would not say amazing. But they do have a trick to attract people (in Japan culture), it is the stamp collection. For each signature spots or places they want you to visit (a bit like ikea, try to guide you to walk through the place), there has stamp station for you to stamp onto the leaflet and you can collect all or not (can have souvenir). And I quite obsessed into collect things personally so I sucked into it, and spent 1 to 2 hours to walk around to collect all. They also has pay and free areas, pay area I would say not much to see tbh. I don't recommend that but you are like me, want to collect all stamps then you need to pay money to go in. can get discount (JPY820 originally) if you show 1 or 2 days monorail pass."
46,Worth the heritage visit,"went here as part of a shore tour, the castle looked great and seemed to have lots of interesting things to look at the grounds and gardens also looked very interesting.  unfortunately we were only allowed a very limited time here so seemed to be rushed through with no time to stop and look.  there were some steep steps to access the main area and you are required to remove your shoes in one of the areas. Personally think it would be a great place to visit and send the day, but for us unfortunately that was not allowed."
47,Okinawa's historic castle and surrounding parkland.,"It's nice that this castle is so different from the ones you can visit on the Japanese mainlands. There are many gates and buildings to see here, plus they have a stamp collecting game, which is fun and it makes you to see every remarkable spot without missing any of them. It was a bit crowded though."
48,Nicole,This is a lovely lacquered palace. You have to take your shoes off and carry them while you walk through the palace. Our guide told us about various rooms. I think you can download an audio so that you can guide yourself.
49,Wonderful ,"Shurijo castle is definitely worth a visit. It's very sad that hardly any part of it is original, it was all destroyed by the Americans in 1945. It has however been beautifully restored and much of it is quite recent. It costs 820Ypp for entry and the ticket booth is quite a distance inside the gate so don't think you've missed it just keep walking. The grounds are also beautiful to walk through and you can see old tunnels and a beautiful bridge over the lake."
50,Well repaired castle with interesting myth,This castle is a beautiful place to walk around and view the history behind it. We really enjoyed the tour of the grounds.
51,Beware of a great sunset view,"Restored nicely, this castle has an impressive facade and showcases some artefacts from the past. You can go higher up to get a view of the castle grounds too."
52,Very enjoyable,"We probably followed the signage for cars and walked a longer route to get to the castle. We walked to Ryutan-dori from the monorail station. From there, we walked along route 29 and 49 to the main access way (Samukawa-dori) to Shurijo Castle, passing blue seal ice cream, Lawson convenience store and Ryutan (dragon pond) on our way. Based on google map, it was a 1.4 km walk. We would have shortened the walk by 300m if we turned left after Lawson. But it was late March, the weather was nice and there were lots of blooming flowers along the way, the longer walk wasn't strenuous at all.On entering Samukawa-dori, you will pass by a little house on your right which has a resting place, lockers, toilets and a souvenir shop. We would have missed this place if we took the left turn at Lawson. This place also distributes a stamping pamphlet where fans can affix location ink stamps to the pamphlet when you reach various locations in Shurijo Castle.We reached Shurijo Castle at 10 am+ then slowly toured the castle compound. Access is free until you reach the square inside Koufukumon (廣福門). The suggested route is to take the stairs from Kankaimon (歓會門) to Koufukumon (廣福門), tour the castle and indoor exhibits (purchase the entrance tickets at the counter near Koufukumon (廣福門)), then exit via the slope from the square inside Koufukumon (廣福門) to Kobikimon (木曳門). Shurijo Castle does not have much sheltered area. There was a tentage with seats for tourists to watch a short traditional Okinawan performance at the square inside Koufukumon (廣福門) on the Friday we went."
53,Neat,Magnificent like all castles and temples in the world but Shurijo Castle is unique to the region. The only unfortunate thing for us on our day of visit was that part of it was in renovation. It was a lovely day out nonetheless.
54,There’s a man who’s sole job is to straighten used plastic shoe bags!,"This is a very different style to all other styles of castle/palace we have seen. Mostly rebuilt it still gives a good representation of its times. Quite easy to get to using the monorail, 820 Yen to enter.  Wi-fi available in the grounds."
55,beautiful history/lots of steps,"The castle is currently being renovated, so the pretty part is covered with scaffolding. The inside that has been renovated looks therefore very new, with IKEA style wood. There is not much to see in the museum itself...they are showing you clothes/objects, but it lacks explanations and consistence. The park around is nice, but I kind of regret my visit there. Not worth the 800¥ entrance fee in my opinion. I'm glad I got the discount price with my transport pass."
56,Great castle and park,The whole castle was rebuilt 70 cm above ground.  So what we get to see was a “relatively new castle”.   They have very small portion of original remnants left where they will show through a glass from the wooden floor. View from the location was nice with great city view. Can get to understand the history during the walk inside.
57,looked great,"Although the main part of the castle ​burnt down recently, it's still possible to enter and see the impressive castle walls & unique main gates and get views of the city/ocean from above. The destroyed portion is fenced off so you'll probably only need half an hour to walk…"
58,Unesco Heritage,"Not as huge as expected but very beautiful. You can see that it's well managed and preserved to allow visitors to know what it's like living in the castle. There's also a showcase of artifacts. The entrance fee might be a little pricey as compared to others, but I feel like it's worth it. It felt peaceful, unlike most other tourist spots that felt so rushed and crowded. Many spots to take great pictures too."
59,Castle ona hill,"I came here with a tour guide and am glad I did! The castle is enormous and there's actually a lot of fun activities around the castle like dying shirts with coral. There's a lot to take in, I loved the stamps."
60,Go early,The castle worth a visit. It is also a nice experience to walk around during night that castle a surrounding areas a nicely lighted. From the surrounding area there is a nice view of the city.
61,Must do!,"I really enjoyed the visit to this place. The castle is beautiful and gives one a glimpse into the ryukyu culture.I really appreciated the small tea room inside the castle. Traditional tea and sweets are served and presented to tourists there. Also, the price is very reasonable. Another enjoyable activity was the stamp hunt which we completed successfully and received the small gift at the information center. Last, but not least, the surrounding park is really beautiful and full of luxurious flora."
62,Rebuilt castle,Amazing Castle and surrounding gardens. Take time to go through the castle and see its history. Make sure you take time to stroll through the gardens. They are so peaceful.
63,Must visit,We thought it would be just another castle visit but we ended spending 4h there. It was interesting to see how the king lived and we also enjoyed the tea and snacks served to royalty.
64,Visited when closed,"The castle is still kept in a pristine condition. Location is ideal and easily accessible. Best time to go is in the morning when it's not too crowded yet. Once inside the castle, take your time to read all the explanation so as to have a better understanding on the history of Castle. No shoes are allowed inside the but the staffs at the entrance will pass you a plastic bag so that you can bring along your shoes as you wander through the halls of the Chambers..."
65,Historic palace of Ryukyu kingdom,Good for everyone who love walk/ climbing and seeing the view. Very nice view on top of this castle.
66,Not a must,The views from the castle are beautiful. You get to go through several areas of the castle - which was really cool to see!
67,Worthwhile stop in Naha,"If you are in Naha for a day, this is your must see. Very easy to get to on the Monorail. Get off at the Shuri Station and the then it is a short 0.5 mile walk. The grounds and palace are nice. You take a self-guided tour by following signs. Limited information is provided but it is enough.  There is a good amount of stairs involved to see everything. You can also walk the ramparts. At the main gate, you can dress up in traditional costumes for a fee and get your photo taken. After you are done, take the short walk to the family mausoleum. It is a separate smaller fee and takes about 15 minutes to see. Watch you head 😁"
68,Shurijo Castle a beautiful monument to the past,It is an interesting place to place to visit. Got to understand why there are always 2 lions in front of a building in Okinawa. The set set view from the castle is spectacular. My kids enjoyed collecting the stamps that they provided around the castle when you reached the different areas of the castle.
69,Worth to spend a day to explore,"We went here when it was cold and rainy, but it was well worth it! So many interesting artifacts. The castle itself is beautiful inside. Fun to walk around the grounds. The restaurant is a nice place to eat at. Highly recommend getting a blue seal ice cream before you go."
70,Nice day trip out,Mostly enjoyed the city views as the main buildings were under construction due to a fire last year.
71,Great historical lesson! ,"A short drive from Naha city centre, this place is different from a traditional Japanese Castle you might expect.  The Ryukyu style architecture has lineage from its neighbouring culture and the exhibition inside walks you through the history.  Great day out for families, where kids can play collect the stamp game following a well laid out trail."
72,Nice for learning the History,The site it signed fairly well in English. You can imagine the Ryukyu kings holding court. It's very popular and there's a lot of people around you rushing through. You can spend several hours (slowly) inside the castle and also the free park area if you like. I did manage to find a 500yen all day parking in a back street which was great.The stone road is close by and you can't park nearby so I would recommend going from the castle.
73,Big castle,"This is the main attraction when visiting Naha, Okinawa. It was smaller than I expected. I was glad we hired a private bus for the day so we did not have to take that long walk from the monorail station. We parked at the underground parking lot and just took the elevator up. Free entry to the park/grounds but had to pay 800 Y to enter the castle. Free for disabled and one companion. It was very crowded inside the castle. Felt like a herd of cattle being pushed through the line but glad we got in at least to see the throne. Very Chinese, if you ask me. Wish we had more time there to see the rest of the park. Hopefully, will return someday."
74,Interesting place,"The Shuri castle is definitely a must see in Okinawa. It’s really pretty. can be very crowded so do plan your journey there.There’s a nice tea set that you could enjoy in the castle itself. Do try that if you had the chance, nice experience!"
75,UNESCO Site,"I enjoyed this castle but be prepared to remove your shoes and not be able to take pictures in all the rooms. If you do not have a tour guide, you are on your own but there are signs everywhere in English"
76,Worth a visit for its history,Amazing castle fixed on the northest of naha.Amazing view of the city from the castle and also amazing experience to sightseeing this place!
77,Worth wide for leisure walk,The castle is under renovation at this time but it was very beautiful to see the history and artifacts from the time period. A must is having traditional tea and sweets in the tea room.
78,Nice visit,"This is one must visit castle. Very touristic as many tours will come by, but the historical value is well worth it. It is children and elderly friendly. It starts with a climb up 6 gates before you reach the castle main grounds. Inside the castle, you will now go back centuries ago where many stories will unfold. Finally at the end of the castle, there is another few more steps up the observatory deck for a final majestic view and scenic view of the city of Okinawa. Highly recommend if in Okinawa."
79,Castle,"Having been to other more authentic castles in Japan, this castle was very much a disappointment as it felt very much like it was built with the sole purpose of making it a tourist attraction. Having said that, they did take great effort to replicate the castle to give us an idea of what it might have looked like."
80,"Need to See, worth a trip","I was extremely excited about visiting Shuri Castle. It's in Japan, but used to belong to a royal family that presided over its own independent kingdom (Ryukyu), so it felt like I was going somewhere really ancient and unique.But it's not ancient, not really. Because the castle is a reconstruction and this was the feeling you got when you went inside the main hall. I found the exterior relatively impressive (the architecture resembles Chinese architecture). The red striped courtyard is a sight to see, but I imagine I would have been more wowed had there not been a mass of scaffolding over the main hall that substituted for this by hanging up a large print of what you could no longer see behind it.I may as well have been looking at a picture online. Although actually, I blame the online pictures for my disappointing experience because they make it look so spectacular.Inside, you could see a reconstruction of the old Ryukyuan King's throne, amongst other reconstructed artefacts and an exhibition of some legitimate heritage items. Only trouble is, my enthusiasm for such things had dulled because I was so let down by the unexpected scaffolding. I'll admit, there were some other factors not related to the castle that coloured my enjoyment of it. For one, I'd travelled to Okinawa in June, but it was the rainy season so although it was hot it was tipping down so I was walking around the castle getting drenched (didn't do the gardens because of this).Also, I'd mistakenly imagined the castle would be in a beautiful setting a stone's throw from the beach. This is the impression you get when you see pictures in guide books and such. But it was in the middle of the UGLIEST CITY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD - Naha.Entrance fee: 860 yen (tad overpriced). I noticed some accessible areas, but in order to get in to the place I had to go up some steep stairs so not sure about that.We drove there. Wasn't difficult navigating the roads."
81,Definitely worth a visit ,"The entire place is well organized. Inside the palace, there is a path that you just have to follow to tour the entire palace. The palace is orderly and clean, we have to take off our shoes (so be sure to wear socks with no holes!) There is a small dessert shop inside, where you can try their traditional desserts"
82,Tickets to Castle,Interesting although I found the interior tour boring. It is some distance from the monorail station and  wasn't easy to find
83,Excellent,"Well maintained historical and cultural site. Very organised and clearly marked route so you can see all that is on offer. The ‘Stamp Rally’ where you take a stamp sheet and use an ink stamp to stamp landmarks along the route is a genius way to get kids (and adults!) engaged and motivated during the sight seeing. Get all stamps to receive cute stickers and a mini folder at the end. Much of the outer grounds is free, and the inside of the buildings require an entrance fee (¥800).  Good views of the city. The tea set in the building was a lovely break. For ¥310 you get jasmine tea and 4 imperial cookies, served in the tatami room where the prince used to entertain diplomats and guests. The staff are dressed in red kimonos and explain the snacks. Lovely way to spend 1-2 hours."
84,Not so special,"I was not sure what was left after the fire, but I decided to check it, and I am glad I did. Although the main castle part was closed off, I could still explore other areas, and stone works I could see were amazing. It had a nice view of the city. If you are on the fence like I was, I would highly recommend you to still visit the castle. Some areas are free while some area charges for entrance fees (I believe 300 yen or so, so it is very reasonable)."
85,Fun,"This is a must see place for sure, we were lucky to have a really good guide who spoke perfect English and had a clear understanding of the history of the site. One thing to remember is wear easy to remove shoes as you need to take your shoes off to enter the Castle site. Although so much is reconstructed there are a few areas that have original foundations these can be seen through a glass viewing point. Staff in the area are dress in national costumes and they were happy to stand and pose for photographs with guests of on their own. There is a peaceful calm around the place until you get into the gift shop which is bustling, here you can use US dollars as well as Yen to make your purchases. There is a nice walk through to the castle and well worth a couple of hours. Suitable for people of all ages as there is so much to see."
86,Fantastic outside areas to see,It was nice to see it. But pretty much everything was closed by 7 pm. We could not go inside. Alot of venders were closing up. Not many places to really eat in area. We were surprised things close so early.
87,Icon in Okinawa,"This once-spectacular castle was largely destroyed by a fire in the end of October 2019.It’s still possible to visit the site. There’s no charge to enter the site. The guides are still there to help you.But what’s left is broken tiles, burned timbers, and ashes. I cried.I visited Shurijo Castle 30 years ago, just after it was reopened following a major restoration. This year, it was again being refurbished and restored when the fire occurred. The Japanese will rebuild it. Until then, if you’re in Okinawa and don’t mind the sadness of seeing the destruction of this castle, go to Shurijo Castle. While you’re there, leave a donation to assist in the reconstruction."
88,Disappointing,"Castle frontage was undergoing repair works. Knew about it after paying the 820Yen entrance fees and going into the castle grounds. Otherwise, it was about a 30mins tour. Tick in the box!"
89,Julz-overseas productions,"We visited the Shuri Castle on Day-2 of our trip. I was expecting the castle with long history, but it was a building replicated after the war."
90,Interesting part of history,Maybe I am not a so history type of person😂 I think it is not so worth the entrance fee. I should have walk the outside instead.
91,Shurijo Castle ,I arrived the castle by 5:30pm. The castle was not so special as compared with other castles in Japan. It was 1 km apart from the Shuri monorail station.
92,Review my visit,"Didn't enter the paid area but enjoyed walking the grounds of this castle. Still got to see everything, just not up close."
93,Very interesting,Just like many other great temples to visit in Japan. Very lovely view indeed.  It is very beautiful and celebrates slightly a different culture from many of the other temples in mainland Japan. Okinawa is a lovely place to visit and will surely visit again.
94,Great historic place!!,Excellent place to visit and see what potential damage of the fire which engulfed this gorgeous piece of history and burn already restored. Historical Ryukyu castle
95,Replica But Still Interesting,The must place in Okinawa. Do not hesitate to go this place. The car park fee is 320yen/2 hours. 2 hours is enough to look around.
96,Interesting Castle,The castle is situated in the very nice park on top of a hillNice way to spend a few hoursBit crowded due to many visitors but there are still nice spots where it is more quiet The castle is more like a Chinese palace rather than the traditional Japanese type of castleYou can gather the strong influence of the Chinese from this place
97,Interesting,We visited the Shuri Castle right after we got to Naha. The castle seemed new and I came to know it was replicated after the War. Worthwhile visiting to learn about Okinawan history.
98,Sometimes you need a bit of history,"We took the Yu Rail and walked about 1km or 15 to 20mins to the entrance of the castle. Apparently, there is a short cut in and there was an elderly staff at the roadside pointing the way in for us. Great service. Here's a tip. We passed by a small tourism office at the traffic light junction and managed to purchase the entrance tickets at a discounted rate. The usual ticket is now $830 yen but we only paid 770 yen per pax. There is a banner and a poster outside the office. The castle grounds are huge and it's really too hot to walk outside for too long today. The interiors were interesting although most exhibits are in Japanese. The tea with sweets is now 500 yen per person. We didn't try. The highlight was the photo opportunity outside. Overall, we enjoyed the visit."
99,Must go!,"I think I built up my expectations of the castle because the surrounding park area is so very beautiful.  As we entered the paid part of the museum (Y820) we removed our shoes and put them in the plastic bag they handed us at the door.  The castle has been totally renovated and is, for the most part, barren of any kind of furniture other than a throne.  There was a display of stringed instruments and a very few decorative paintings, but other than that there was little to see on our self-guided walk.  On my next visit I will save my entrance fee and just absorb the beauty of the surrounding park grounds."
100,On your own from Naha cruise port,Enjoyed our visit here will a well restored  castle and well laid out tour. Castle is positioned high on a hill with great views and there is a good tourist centre to take a break and rest with a decent restaurant
101,A disappointment!,Very well set out attraction. Most of the exhibits had an English translation and we enjoyed learning about the area and it's history. At around ¥800 it's well worth it. Take the monorail to the last stop and it's around 10 mins easy pace on foot. 
102,Colourful and stylish 'Seiden'!,The original Castle was completely destroyed during WWII. What we see today is a reconstruction based on photographs and available plans.Getting to the Castle area is no easy task as you must walk an uphill path and a number of stairs. This is the Path to the Seiden where you will see a number of gates. The wheelchair path misses the sites along the path. The Museum tour is basically self guided. You must remove your shoes (you are given a bag to carry them) to walk through the halls. As my wife has orthopedic boots she declined the tour. Walking on bare feet would be too painful. The Ryukyu exhibits were somewhat on the sparse side. The staff were all dressed in period costume. There is no air conditioning inside the museum and it was very hot. There are free hand fans to keep cool.  During our visit there were large crowds. The tour finishes on the second floor. We spent the last 15 minutes in a mass crowd as we funneled onto a staircase and the exit where people are putting their footwear back on. Staff collect the bags for recycling.
103,"Well organised, plenty of staff.","A castle in the city! Just few minutes by the Yui Rail, you can visit this very Okinawan castle. With Yui Rail Daypass, you will have discount in the paid area. I enjoyed the map stamping that they are giving for the visitors.The staff is also friendly and helpful and will try to communicate English to nonJapanese speakers!"
104,Wow!,For 820 yen you can visit the parts that are paid. Totally worth it.If you complete the stamp rally you get stickers and a gift.
105,Parking very difficult,"It’s one of the main tourism attractions on the island and the location and scale are impressive , the overall display and tour is reasonably average compare to a lot of similar attractions in other countries. The mono rail is the best way to get upto it and a bit of walking from there. It’s worth the visit but doesn’t have the wow factor."
106,Interesting and different,"Second time i came. We took a map of the site and stamp each building we visited. The first starts at the tourist info center so remember to get it stamped. The second is the entrance gate. As we went from second level we missed these 2 stops and had to detour. It was just a fun way to ensure we do not miss out any site. We took 2.5 hours including lunch at the tourist center, there is a restaurant on level 2. It is historical journey. So read up before you visit. We had a picnic at a rest stop. There is a sheltered area with beverage vending machines. We had wanted to sit by the pond but due to rain, we decided to just have the picnic under this sheltered rest stop.It was fun.You can take a train direct to the castle but this time we took a taxi. Less than 2000 yen.We were able to pick up some souvenir there as well."
107,Shurijo Castle,We spent a relaxing 5 - 6 hours to thoroughly visit every corner of the castle! This is one of the must-visit places in Naha to understand and appreciate the history of Ryukyu kingdom.   Entrance fee is ¥660 per person. It was a bummer that we were not able to take a good…
108,Good for a walk and visit,"Unfortunately we had a rainy day, so didn't do as much walking in the park surrounding the castle as we would have liked. We went inside the castle, which is not old, as it is a reconstruction. Inside it is mainly empty rooms, so we actually found the outside of the building more interesting than the inside.We were visiting Naha on a cruise ship. We walked up from the cruise port to the Kencho-Mae station, and caught the monorail up to Shurijo Castle, which is about a 15 minute walk from the Shuri Station.  This would be a highlight of Naha. It was very busy when we were there."
109,Under renovation,We reached there around 4 pm and stayed til a closing hour so that we had a chance to watch sunset from this castle and it was fantastic!Staffs are friendly and kind to foreigners.Don’t miss a performance!
110,Interesting Site,"Although the main keep of the castle is under renovation due to massive fire, the surrounding grounds offer a nice, quiet and scenic views of the city and many small hidden area are arranged so visitors can take pictures and enjoy the nature."
111,Nice price with valuable price,Didn’t end up going into the castle due to lack of time. Was rushing for my bus to Ginowan. But the walk around the castle park was very scenic and totally worth the time it took to get over there. 😊😊
112,A must in Naha,"Parking is limited within the attraction. I had to find a carpark in the vicinity.  Limited car park and very expensive.  500 yen for an hour.  The attraction is very crowded. The castle is not original, just a replicate of what it was suppose to be with added modern amenities…"
113,Super ,I think it's good to visit the castle to understand the culture and history of Okinawa.  It's easy to go and actually quite enjoyable by travelling on their light rail.  A pleasant walk.
114,A must-visit place of interest in Naha,The castle is a good to see in order to understand more about pre-Japan Okinawa.  It is certainly worth a visit.
115,Quite different!,the castle has a very interesting architecture. at the moment is undergoing a renovation but it is still a place worth knowing.
116,A good stroll but does not worth the entrance ticket,"A big territory, there is an interesting museum inside (entrance fee), it is not allowed to take pictures."
117,Cool castle with good views,"This place is a must visit in tour program.  Recommend to go by car due to the walk way to the castle is very steep.  This place is registered the world heritage and it is worth to visit.  Parking is available with fee, staffs manage very well in assist us find a parking.  The entrance fee is 800 yen/person, you have to take off your shoe before enter the wooden castle."
118,Shurijo Castle New Year's Celebration,"Shuri Castle is enjoyable to visit. The old stone walls and temples around the castle are particularly photogenic. The castle itself has been heavily restored. There is currently scaffolding around the main hall. It has a distinctive red paint job that does not make it look authentic. Inside there are replicas of the bowls and armour used in the old times. The grounds are well kept. It is worthwhile getting the stamp map and going around collecting all of the stamps. Kids and some adults will love it. 800 JPY for an adult to enter. There are toilets and plenty of vending machines with water because it can be quite exhausting walking around in the heat. The castle is also easily accessible by wheelchair. While it isn't as grand as many other forts in the world, Shuri Castle is certainly worth spending a couple of hours wandering around."
119,Unique Ryukyu design castle on beautiful grounds,"Compared to your usual castles in central Japan this place is truly a treat. The building itself is still a reproduction but the area is huge, it looks amazing and it’s especially worth going inside because you get to walk through many rooms and the displays (including expensive decorations) are amazing. You get to see an Okinawan garden and for an additional price of ¥300 you can try tea with a treat. With the free map you could also go on a fun stamp hunt. Definitely a must visit."
120,Recommended ,"Love the history and architecture. Love how they try to maintain this place at their best. When you are in Okinawa, you must go! Even if you are not interested in history, you will enjoy the walk."
121,Horrible Service at Customer Service,"Shurijo is just beautiful and must be on every travelers list when visiting Okinawa.Park in the official underground parking for practically same price as other outdoor parkings (I think it was even cheaper). Right there when you exit the underground parking and where info centre is located is ticket machine. Buy your tickets there (english supported) to skip the queues at the entrance of the castle!You will have to take off shoes for castle visit (plastic bags provided) so I advice you to have socks if you do not feel comfortable “sharing” floor with bare feet.It can get hot in summer, so try to go on cloudy day. Inside of the caste is cooled so do not worry.For 300yen you can enjoy tea and okinawan ryukyu era sweets in the castle, it was totally worth it, so I recommend that too!"
122,Major Site,"If you've been to castles in Japan before, this is a new experience. It has a very Chinese style to it, not like the towering palaces in most places. It's more spread out and has different themes in color and design. The paths wending up to the main buildings are a great walk, too, with many beautiful sidetracks you can take. Once you get to the main building, there are great views of Naha and the surrounding areas. Don't miss it!"
123,Reconstructed History,"This is one of the recommended places to visit whilst you are in Okinawa.It offers an insight and history of the Old Kingdom.The castle grounds areas are scenic and offers many opportunities for nice pictures ( except in the interior of the main building where photography is not allowed ).Walking from the castle entrance through the various gates to the main building perched on top high ground can be challenging for the elderly.Also the high steps leading to the gates are slippery during wet weather.It is advisable to walk up to the main building using the route for wheelchairs,Entrance to the castle grounds is free except one has to pay an admission fee of JYP 850 to get inside the main building.The layout and exhibits inside the building are fascinating."
124,Great local site ,"Very easy to get to via the monorail. Interesting castle. You have to pay to get in and walk around the inside, but it was worth it. The grounds are also nice and have great views over the city."
125,Interesting ,Busted the castle during our visit to Naha. It was restored & the exhibits gave an interesting insight to the life of royalty in the past. The surrounding park was also a nice place for a leisurely stroll.
126,Beautiful surroundings!,"If you manage to find parking at the main entrance , walk to entry of castle is about 100m . Otherwise if the carparks were full ( we reached around 330 pm) then you have to park behind the castle in the many little carpark scattered all around . We paid 500 yen for two hours parking at a private residence . What is worse , to access the castle, we had to walk about 100m up a steep slope , then 100m on flat ground , then skirted the castle wall walking up and down stairs. By the time we reached the exit point of the attraction , we were all winded . You had to walk another 100 m on flat ground to get to the entrance . To me , if there is no parking at the front of the castle , forget about this attraction or go another time especially if you have strollers and elderly with you."
127,It’s a beautiful walk to the castle,There is a streamlined tour for the inside of the castle but outside of it it feels somewhat unrestricted (minus the obviously fenced off areas). I highly recommend this for someone who has never been to a Ryukyu castle.
128,Nothing much to see inside castle,"If you are driving, look for the signs indicating parking for Shurijo Castle. Ignore the other carparks nearby on the way to the castle. There is a large underground carpark and there are attendants who will guide you to the parking lot."
129,Lovely replica,"Nothing spectacular about this place other than its history.  However, when in Okinawa, this is one of the historical places to visit."
130,Beautiful grounds!,"If you like castles and World Heritage Sites, this is a must.Very easy to get to by monorail or taxi."
131,Wonderful site and guide,"My husband brought me to the historical castle in Okinawa. Easy access From Shuri Monorail station, it’s only 10-15 minutes walk. It’s is a nice place overlooking the town. A castle filled with Okinawan history. One of the must see place in Okinawa. Entrance fee can be a bit pricey tho, If you have a one day rail pass and you’ll get a discount for the Castle’s entrance fee."
132,Castle Park,Great place to take the family to see spectacular views and also see how a Japanese castle was like in Okinawa. Well worth the entrance fee and worth the exercise up and down the castle grounds.
133,It is worth the time and the climb to visit,We visited this beautiful castle and grounds and pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and layout of the castle. The original castle was destroyed by the U.S. during WW2 when the Japanese were headquartered here. Only the walls remained. The reconstruction was based on historical records and the restorers have done an exceptional job of recreating the look and feel of this historical castle. We spent two hours in the area and enjoyed it. Not  really a place to go back to again but glad We visited.
134,Worth a visit,"If you come to Okinawa, this is a main place where you must visit.location is in Naha city area. nearest station - Shuri (last stop of Yui rail the monorail system starts from Naha airport)There are many mini locations around Shuri Castle as well."
135,Untimely Visit,"Even though restoration works are in progress, the castle is still interesting (architecture in particular) to visit despite insufficient English/Chinese translation for international tourists."
136,A place to hang out when you have extra time,Visited on April 2019. Shuri Castle full of historical story behind which is perfect to visit and learn to know more about Okinawa or Ryukyu Kingdom in the past. There are a lot of paid-parking around the castle make it easily access to the castle. Walking route around the castle take about 1 - 1.5 hours.
137,Do the scavenger hunt for stamps!,"This is an attraction which required entrance fee. Nevertheless, one can soak into the history with the walk through of the exhibits and galleries with actual setting in the past."
138,Nothing much,While your in Okinawa check out Shuri Castle.  Great place to learn a little bit of the history while you're on holiday.
139,Castles are just awesome,Worth a visit although steps are required but take your time and the views and history are worth it. We were on an organised tour for a 4 hour duration in a group.
140,Interesting,"This place is touted as one of the must-see places in Okinawa. Honestly found it a bit underwhelming and touristy. The place was packed, but luckily the area was large.   There was paid underground parking, and signages were everywhere, making it easy to navigate around. It's…"
141,Shurijo Castle,The kids really enjoyed stopping at the passport stands to stamp their brochure. There are enough to occupy them on the free section of the castle. We didn’t pay to see the other parts. Great view from the top and informative stops along the route. Bring cash to pay for parking - credit card not accepted.
142,Beautiful castle in downtown Naha,The castle itself and the non-guided tour are one of the best I have ever experienced. You can stroll along with your party and enjoy the beauty of a castle unlike any other you will encounter in Japan. The Ryukyu Kingdom was  a fascinating part of the history and culture of this part of asia and worht the small price of admission.
143,Nice Temple,"We came here on our last day in Okinawa. The undercover parking was 380yen which was very conveniently located. The castle itself has paid and non paid areas. The non pain areas still have some interesting things to look at and lots of information signs in different languages. The paid section was 830yen and the signs stated that there was a discount if you had a monorail day pass. The restored castle is partly a museum with real and reproduced relics. You get to walk inside the restored wooden castle where they have installed modern elements such as wheelchair lifts and handrails. In typical Japanese style there is a stamp rally throughout the castle and if you complete all the stamps, you collect a small gift. Overall it was a beautiful castle with a great view from the wall. Although it's not an authentic experience it was still quite interesting."
144,The Royal Palace of the old Ryukyu Kingdom,We were told this was a must do on our list of places to go in my husbands heritage country and we were not disappointed!  This is an amazing castle with an extraordinary story.  There is so much culture and history in this place. We thought it was so crazy that they rebuilt…
145,Very pretty castle,This castle is very different compared to the other castles in the mainland. It reflects a very diversified culture in the olden days. We can see elements of Chinese culture in the architecture of the castle. It’s free to visit and walking around the castle presents many beautiful views.
146,History Lesson Appreciated,The castle is very unique due to the mixture in design between Japanese and Chinese. The place is huge and the garden is very beautiful. Highly recommended!
147,Nice place for a walk,So this is my third time in Okinawa and I have been to Shurijo Castle every time with a new group of people. The castle has stayed the same through every trip that I have been on but the grounds have been improved. The best part of this site is that everything is in both Japanese and English so you are able to read about all the historic events that occurred here like the G-8 summit. This can easily take a few hours out of your day going to just this site alone. But if you look you can find this on a couple of tour routes so that you get a rich history of the islands.
148,Good walk,"The facade of the castle was under refurbishment.  Unless one has a good understanding of Ryukyu history, don't think can really appreciate what were inside."
149,One of prime tourist attractions near Naha,"Shurijo CastleNahathis is THE castle to visit in Okinawa.582297428Wife and I had one day in Naha, and decided this was the place to visit. Sure enough, it is! Located at 1-2, Shuri-Kinjo-cho, Naha-shi, Okinawa. Taxi drivers and Google Maps know exactly were it is and how to get there. You need at least half a day to do it justice. There are so many things to see, and information to try to absorb. I had no idea Okinawa had such a long history, and such close ties with China. Since the weather was cool, it was pleasant to walk through the castle, despite the throngs of other visitors: school kids, families with young children, elders, etc. The castle grounds are extensive, too, and there are several very important historical sites to visit. I recommend a Google search and check out several of the entries for more information and photos (you are not allowed to take photos in some parts of the castle, so you'll have to depend on the official photos authorized by the Castle). With a history (search for Shuri_Castle on Wikipedia; tripadvisor required me to remove the link) dating back to the 11th Century, a capsule review just doesn't cut it - you really need to experience it. And the experience is well worth the 800 yen price of admission."
150,Beautiful colors contrast,limited interest for foreigners. Not a lot to visit but nice views on the city. A bit far from monorail (specially on a hot day)
151, Nice but not a must do.,"Compared to Nakijin Castle, it was a Castle that is intact with much restoration done to it. The size of the Castle is really amazing and grand. Space is vast therefore children will enjoy running in this space. It had a stamp rallying activity that will definitely entice the children as they want to complete walk in the Castle to collect all the stamps. The whole journey will give you about 22 stamps!"
152,Cool castle visit,"Learn quite a bit of the Ryukyu history.  The flow is also very nice as we moved seamless through the castle, doesn't feel rushed and crowded."
153,No need to go,"This is a must visit because it's close and the tickets are reasonably priced.  They also take credit cards.  There are 4 shows make sure you coordinate accordingly I think the times are 10:30, 2:30, 4:30 or so get there an hour before so you don't wait too long"
154,"Nice Site for Tourists, Replica Castle ","Having visited castles in many countries, this one was a little unexpected to see at first as it was not unlike the buildings we saw in Beijings forbidden city. Yes there are huge walls around it, and it can be a bit of an uphill climb with all those steps through the various gates, but it does have a lot to offer you in Japanese style architecture.Sadly the original building was blown to bits during WW2, but they have done a fabulous job of recreating the original. Except on our visit, they were still doing a bit of construction work, so maybe the outside was not at its best.Then it was off with the shoes as we padded through various levels of what a  life would have been like in the Seiden .Lots of artwork to see, but photography on some levels is not allowed. However the throne room of the Ryukyu royal family is allowed, and it is impressive with a massive throne on display fit for a king- which it was originally. The rest of the rooms seem a little spartan by modern standards.There are other buildings to see , but rain did not help us much that day. There is a gift shop in the adjoining Hokuden building (and toilets too) and some exhibitions of local history.The coach stop building also has souvenir shops, and a cafe up top to recover in should you need it."
155,A rebuilt castle ,The shurijo castle is one of the  world Herritage in Naha . Easy to go there by Yuri ( Monorail) . Entrance fee is required .
156,Interesting castle,"It's a thoughtful castle with the right amount of write up, enabling tourist to understand the history of okinawa easily."
157,Interesting Day In An Old Kingdom Castle,"Loved our walk outside of the castle. If you follow the attraction's map, the walk will lead you out to the connecting town and back into the castle grounds....amazing.  There's a look-out point that you can view the whole Naha city."
158,A long walk from Shurijo Monorail station.,"Nice architecture but not much to see, most of it is indoors , lot of artifacts but not really interesting. Nice photos to make, otherwise don't expect too much. "
159,"THE castle to visit in Naha, Okinawa",This is definitely one of the must visit place in Okinawa where you should spend a couple of hours here.Some people will just prefer to tour the outer walls and not go into the inner palace but I would think that the entrance fees were worthwhile.Take a rest at the tea house within the inner palace and have a tea set. Their Okinawa traditional pastries were really nice to eat and the small charge for the tea set considered reasonable.Will probably not take more than 2 hours in total.
160,Beautiful castle,"I was quite disappointed with this place. A 15 minute walk from the nearest monorail station, the outer gates and walls were interesting, but once you’re in the paid area (820 yen per adult!) you’re greeted not by a breathtaking courtyard and castle building as the photos would have you believe, but a building site filled with construction bollards and scaffolding. You then have to take your shoes off and follow a regimented route indoors through lots of empty, varnished wood corridors with only a few interesting artefacts to look at, most of which are replicas. The kimono and picnic boxes were very interesting, and the staff were friendly. All in all, I wouldn’t recommend this place. There must be more interesting and authentic historical sites on Okinawa to spend time at."
161,A View of Old Japan,Went to Castle as last itinerary for the day and trip.Glad we did not missed it.The whole history of the Ryukyu dynasty was played out in the castle via display.Quite impressive.
162,Well restored old palace ,Be ready to have your best socks on as you will need to remove your shoes and carry them in a bag supplied to enter the castle. A lot of information in English (only western language available) in the flyer and on the information boards
163,Came with Japanguide Junko. Stamps were fun.,Shurijo Castle is not a hug castle like others but it has big landscape with an interesting red color castle. Nice and very clean with small open garden on the side. Worth to visit when you are in Okinawa.
164,Great excursion for families,"Must see in Naha.  Clean, organized.  Take the monorail to the last stop.  The Park is about 7 minutes by taxi.  Highly recommended."
165,Worth the walk,Caught the mono rail from the town. Easy and simple to use. The machines have an  English facility. Takes about 10 mins from town and is the last stop. The castle is about a 10 mins walk from station but due to heat and humidity it took us about 15. Ensure you use plenty of sun tan lotion and water you are going to need it. The humidity is unbearable and no shade to be found. There is a steep climb to the castle but there is a platform lift for the disabled. There is an entrance fee an once inside there are only 2 exhibits. Otherwise it's just a hardboard building to walk round. This really is not worth the effort to visit.
166,Historic site,"It's about 15-20 minutes walk from the monorail Shuri station.  They were doing some renovation work so there are scaffolds which kind of ruined the castle view.  You have to take off your shoes if you want to go inside.  The  routes inside the castle were well planned to showcase different rooms.  However they don't allow photos in quite a few rooms.  By the way, if you have a 1-day or 2-day monorail ticket, you can get some discount off the entrance ticket."
167,Beautiful!,We parked underground with a small car and paid 320 yen which allowed us access to the outside grounds of the castle.  Very busy as expected but worth the visit.  I do advise you to just see the outside part as paying for the inner access is not worth the extra cost.
168,Worth the trip ,"If you are in Okinawa, go to Shuri castle. You need about 2-2.5 hours to do the whole castle experience. Bring water/good hiking shoes, because there are a lot of steps. The subway is less than a mile away, or you can take a taxi from the cruise port for less than 20$."
169,well maintained historical building,"Exterior surroundings of castle is beautiful but inside the castle, modern design and nothing much to see except room after room.Only few historical stuffs on display. Need to carry own shoe in a plastic bag when inside castle. Outside castle can have a nice view of Okinawa city."
170,Lovely Castle with history - English signage was a bit confusing at time but ok,Before the Shuri Castle fire (October 2019) this was one of the best places in Naha and a must see world heritage site. There is still a really nice park with peaceful surroundings
171,Nice place to visit,"One of those historical area one shd go in Okinawa. While nothing detailed can be observed comparing it wt those in China, still a good site to take a look. Maintenance ia so so overall."
172,Convenient,Nice Castle worth it for the panoramic viewpoints and beautiful architecture. You have a few souvenir shops and eating options there as well
173,Easy trip on the monorail,We enjoyed the walk up from Kinjo Stone Road so much. It was a strenuous walk but well worth the quaint and historic views.This Castle does not really have an authentic feel to it compared to many we have toured in Japan. Placards state it was based on typical Showa period castles.  It just seems like something built to attract tourists.
174,Ancient castle ,The castle is near Shuri station which is the last station of Yui rail. It was a bit far from the station to the castle. If you have 1 or 2 days pass of Yui rail you will get the discount of the entrance fee around 200 yen. I like the idea that they have a stamp rally for tourist who visit there. If you get stamp at least 8 or all of them you will get the souvenir. It makes me pay attention of all detail in the castle.
175,Informed ,"Rather close to monorail, impressive site, worth taking your time to explore and take in the beauty of the place and learn about the history and culture. Wheelchair accessible, great tea ceremony inside the castle, amazing exhibition and great views from the site. Kid loved running around and collect the stamps, good way to make sure you don’t miss out on any part. Restaurants and souvenir shops around."
176,Worth it for the scenic walk.,"This historical place provides great photo opportunities and a museum to learn about the Ryukyu Kingdom. It is kept very clean and well maintained. There is a nice gift shop inside the castle with a cafe where one can buy refreshments and food. When you exit the castle, there are booths to buy cheap souvenirs, another gift shop and a nice restaurant."
177,Good time in hunting for stamps,"It is fasinating castle on high land. We can perceive great view from the castle. This is world heritage sight, but unfortunately some part was burnt. Beautiful garden and great form of trees."
178,Huge Historical Site,"Huge place with stamp activities for kids, and beautiful scenery and history for the adults. Can spend about 2hrs and relatively wheelchair friendly."
179,Must see,"The castle is in the midst of some renovations so the front is obscured by scaffolding as of Oct 2017.  That said it will look fantastic once the laquer has been applied.The tour is well worth the price and will greatly enhance most peoples knowledge of Okinawan history.Remember, the castle (jo) was destroyed in WWII so this is a very faithful recreation of what the castle looked like.  They are careful to point out the original parts that you can still see.I highly recommend a walk down the ""stone tatami"" path and eating at the restuarant you find on your right at the end of the path."
180,Japan's  11th  UNESCO World Heritage Site,This was a very cool historic site. Also has a hunt to keep kids occupied during the tour so the parents can enjoy the tour.
181,Good historical place located in town,"Historical site, much to see here. The emperor's throne room to the courtyard to interior event rooms, this tour is certainly worth the time if you want to learn some of the history and culture. The gift shop and food are reasonably priced. Be prepared to remove your shoes when touring the interior. Overall a delightful visit."
182,Cultural dances,"If you are sufficiently confident to travel a few stops on the monorail and enjoy plenty walking, you can spend a lovely few hours seeing this area and visiting the castle on your own. We had originally booked a ship tour which was cancelled and so at fairly short notice decided to sort something ourselves.The attached map photo shows the port (circled in pink) and the monorail line which travels via Furujima and on to Shurijo. We disembarked the ship first thing and walked directly up to the monorail station, Kencho-Mae, crossing 2 or 3 road junctions (bottom left box). We purchased a day pass (inexpensive) and on arrival at Shurijo station, followed the directions to the castle, which obviously includes some uphill. We felt that this castle was sufficiently different to others seen on our cruise/tour to be worthwhile. If you can get there early (before the tour buses) it is rather nice and whilst in reality there was little to see inside, some artefacts and history (no photography allowed), the main Hall was certainly photogenic from outside. Nominal fee for entry.We then walked back to the monorail and disembarked at an earlier stop, for Makishi, enabling us to experience the market and surrounding streets. The fish market was very interesting, as were some of the pottery stalls and the expensive liqueur with a viper in the jar! We stopped for coffee at the black sugar stall and continued this route back to the ship. Enroute and very close the ship is also the Naminoue Shrine and gardens and understand from others who didn’t venture too far on their own, that these were also very pleasant. Enough to see and do here for a few hours and has a different feel to other Japanese ports."
183,Amazing 14th Century Fortress!,"Took the monorail to the Suri exit and then short walk to the castle. Was crowded with tour groups, but was amazing! Spend the extra money to do the inner tour, which you will need to take your shoes off. Was very interesting! Take your time as you walk around. I would also suggest going in morning and then instead of following the exit, go back the way you came and go for a traditional Okinawa lunch"
184,Lots of exercise!,The palace building was mainly rebuilt according to the original design which was destroyed years ago because these buildings was mainly built by woods. Inside the building there’s a historic museum to tell the history of Okinawa and some old things to see. Outside the garden there’s old stone walls that gives you the historic feeling. It took 2 to 3 hours to view the whole area and it is a must-go place for the travelers who want to add some historic part in their trip in Okinawa.
185,A little bit of walk but easy to get to,"Great local site to see. Visited with my daughter, we took lots of pictures and enjoyed the sites on the property."
186,A Must See Place when in Okinawa,"The park itself is a good stroll and offers great view of Naha when the weather is nice. However, the ""paid area"" is very small (given the 800 JPY entrance fee) and does not offer much other than viewing the main building."
187,Birthplace of Karate. ,"Good to have a visit to Castle to know more about how the palace of royal family looks like.It amazed me that it was so hot but inside the castle, it wasn't as hot as outside and breeze came through from some of the spots/windows."
188,Not Much to See,Located at the end of the monorail station about 15 minutes walk away. Expect to climb some stairs and slopes. The views up the top were quite nice.The park is clean and expect tour groups there so can be a little noisy. Usually a Mandarin speaking tour guide will lead Chinese visitors there. You may even be able to stand around to listen about the park and the castle. A great place for a stroll and take pictures.
189,a little dissappointing,"We enjoyed our visit to Shuri castle. Having been to quite a few castles in Japan, it was interesting to see the differences in style here and the use of colour (red predominantly). The walking route is well signposted and important areas are explained in English which is helpful. Views from the castle ramparts arealso impressive. At around ¥800, Shurijo is not to be missed when visiting Naha."
190,Worthy of a return trip.,"Whilst in Okinawa (Naha), this is worth a visit for a bit of history.  We were only about a 5-10 minute drive away from our hotel.  Finding reasonably priced parking in the area is a bit tricky.  From memory it was about 500 yen for about 60 minutes or something and then you add on more per hour.  We luckily found a place that was much cheaper for about 500 for 2.5 hours so watch for small private parking options rather than going with the big parking chains.  2.5 -3 hours should be pretty sufficient to check out this place."
191,Beautiful,The castle is easily accessed by the monorail and a 15 minute walk from the station. Set on a hill you have great views over the Okinawa city. The walk through the castle allows you to see many well preserved artifacts and information about the castle's history.
192,Historical information ,"This UNESCO site is a rebuilt palace of pre Japan Okinawa.  The original has been destroyed and rebuilt several times, the latest over the ruins of the last which was destroyed by US forces in 1945.  The wooden structure is appealing. The influence of China is striking."
193,An excellent reproduction,Worth paying the admission fee to go into the castle. Take advantages of the cooling off and rest areas on a hot day. You can buy water there too. The castle itself is very interesting. If you have data and a smart phone you can download an app and get an audio your. Unfortunately we forgot our headphones but there was enough bilingual signage for us to understand what was in front of us. The views from the top of the castle were lovely. Worth visiting.
194,One of a nice place to visit in Okinawa,"As I'm only in Okinawa for 2 weeks, I picked 4 things I wanted to do - this was at the top of my list. I went over the weekend, and it was exactly what I thought it was going to be ... a castle! Lol. The entrance fee is 800JPY, which I was not expecting. You need to pay this in order to go through the gates to see the castle. Once through the gates, you will see the castle and a museum entrance to your right. This museum entrance walks you through the castle and has things such as portraits of previous Emperors. Some areas you are not able to take photos of, but most areas, you are. If you are expecting to see a castle and a piece of history, you will be satisfied (I was!)."
195,Castle in a modern cityu,"Some good 10-minute walk from Shuri monorail station, just follow the crowds if you are not sure the way. If you don't want to walk, there are buses #7 and 8 which can take you near to the gate (didn't spot anyone waiting though).  Entry ticket is ¥820 for adult, there is discount for kids and seniors. It is required to take off your shoes when visiting the palace and the adjacent halls. There is a set visiting path that you have to follow. A plastic bag is provided for bagging your shoes that you will take it along with your visit. Staff at the exit will collect the plastic bag from you. Don't miss the view from the fortress wall too."
196,Fantastic restored castle,Gorgeous red castle stands the test of time. A must see when visiting okinawa. Stunning views and gift shop
197,Historical,"Beautiful, we really enjoyed the tour! We also tried the tea with the typical desert and it was really good! :)"
198,Enjoyable Place to Visit,"Arrived later than planned, so didn't get to see everything. Still it was bigger than expected and has a great view overlooking the city. Worth visiting."
199,Not really worth the effort,"Happen to be here during the new year celebration which features traditional dances and performances, free tea and chance to see some locals wearing traditional outfits visiting. One of the main attraction in Okinawa, it is an ~ 20 mins stroll from the monorail station so be prepared with an umbrella if it rains. Alternatively, a super short walk with feeder bus from Shuri monorail station with a discount after showing the rail ticket. The grounds have nice gardens and design truly unique with both Chinese and Japanese influence. The interior was quite basic and can be completed quickly but nonetheless educational. There is also a tea house inside the castle we passed by during our walk inside. Kids are incentivised to learn about the castle with a program collecting stamps in return for sticker and postcard which I as an adult had fun partaking in too. Definitely a MUST visit if in this perfecture."
200,Nice Park and Castle,"Very interesting place to visit if you are interested in Asian castles. Perfect location to learn more about the Ryukyu kingdom and admire the unique Ryukyu building style which is a mix between traditional Japanese and Chinese styles. The current castle is an exact replica of the original one (which was destroyed during the war) and offers for great views on the surrounding area and Naha, as well as a pleasant walk through the castle's garden. De certain to also visit the lake just outside the walls."
201,Did not live up to expectations,It was my family trip with one of my classmate. We stayed with my friend condo. We drove all around the Okinawa island from north to south. Shurijo is on the mountain overlooking the bay. We walked all up to the top of the hill. Very interesting historical place
202,Historical site,"Easy 15 walk from Suri train station, really nice grounds which are free to get in, the only entrance fee is 840 yen to get into the castle portion, and many foot paths behind as well. Nice views from the very top. Helpful staff, well worth a visit while visiting the seaport."
203,Attractive reconstructed castle,"The Shuri Castle is the most famous Castle in Okinawa and represents the glorious time when the Ryukyu kingdom was an independent nation governed by the Sho (?) dynasty.  Conquered by the Japanese in the 1880s, the Okinawan people lost its kingdom, its independence, and its pride having to give up its native language and culture and be subjugation to Japanese domination.  What's particularly sad is that the Castle was bombed by the Americans during World War II and had to be completely reconstructed (it's been rebuilt at least 4 times) to resemble its original structure.  Unfortunately, it looks like its brand new and not at all what you'd expect in an ancient Castle.  There are hardly any artifacts, mostly empty rooms and little attention to landscaping.  While you should visit it to see for yourself, its best that you take a taxi rather than the monorail since the Castle is at least a 15 minute uphill walk from the station."
204,Nothing original .....,"For me this was nostalgic.  Was here in 1994 and Returned in 2017.  It felt so good to be back in Okinawa.  I see the wear over the years but it was still good to retouch the history.  Both for me and of course the Island and Ryukyu Kingdom.  Awesome views, it is a good place to veg out and catch a presentation-Check it out for yourself."
205,"Impressive castle and restoration work, don't miss the Tea & cookies menu!",This is the second time I've gone to visit the Shurijo Castle. It is a lot of walking and in some places fairly steep. My husband and I brought our 2 children both under the age of 4. We brought a stroller and were afraid of whether or not there would be ramps. We were very happy to see that there were ramps for almost every place there was a stairway entry or exit. There were so many things to see and learn about. They also had a stamp map that my 3 year old enjoyed stamping at every stop.
206,Good tour of the history,"Another stop along our history tour of the island - beautifully reconstructed according to what is known about its original plans.  We had made our way along the US invasion route during the Battle of Okinawa, starting off with the beaches where the US troops invaded near Sunabe…"
207,Loved the surrounding grounds,"The reviews were in favour of the castle's gardens but not of the castle itself. We were very happy that we've decided to buy tickets for the castle, as it shows a perfect example of the ancient reign and of the incredible restoration work & lacquer painting invested there. The temporary exhibition featured treasures of the kings and was very interesting as well. We almost missed it, as it is in the hosting chambers, the tea room where one can pay for a tea & cookies set. The 4 different cookies follow ancient recipes and the tea can be refilled by the nice staff. A great break from the heat as well, overlooking the Zen garden. Do plan 2-3 hours if you include the castle tour, as well as the gardens."
208,Okinawa's (old Ryukyu Kingdom) only remaining Castle,Nice historical site. Kids can also enjoy stamp collecting and get a small gift after collecting the full set of stamps.
209,Just had to be there to check it off the list,Shurijo Castle is a pleasant location to visit. Collect a map at the information centre at the shop and your kids will enjoy collecting the 25 stamps that mark places of interest throughout the grounds. It's a pleasant walk. We did not enter the inner centre of the castle which means we did not payment an entrance fee. There is some information in English but more could have been provided. Mandarin and Korean signage is also available. It is a 20 minute walk from the monorail but is well marked with sign posts so is easy to find.
210,Half day visit to this castle ,"The nearest monorail to walk to the castle is Gibo station instead of Shuri Station. I’ve attached the map gotten from the kind station officer for your reference.The walk from Gibo to the entrance of castle was very pleasant. You are able to see how & the kinda of environment the local stays there. It’ll cost you 820¥ to enter to the castle to learn more historical information. But you will need to read the information yourself, else you can always hire a guide to do the job for u.The map of the castle can be collected at the ticketing counter. Through the map, you should covered all the main stations, places u need to see, to know about the castle. On top of it, you will collect a castle souvenir; which is a sticker & a paper folder once u’ve collected all the 25 + 3 stamps at stops number 25.The souvenir snacks are cheaper than buying outside the castle. Thus, I would recommend to buy there if you are prepared to buy some back. Be prepared to spend about 2-3 hours of touring the place. Excellent view from the edge of the castle to view Okinawa."
211,Beautiful place to visit!,"The castle has good historical value, but not very attractive. The buildings are “Chinese” rather than “Japanese “ in design, and are artistically commonplace. The castle sits at the top of a hill. Visitors can reach the top by walking up flights of steps.  There is a slip road where the steps can be avoided. There are many visitors but the courtyard is quite large and can accommodate many. On the top, visitors can have a good view of the city below. On the whole, there are no surprises. No harm coming to visit, spend about 45 to 60 minutes, but not really a must."
212,Unexpectedly interesting,Very beautiful place with long time historical. Clean and nice staff. The fee is acceptable. Good scenery for photo.
213,Not much to see,Last year we travelled to Okinawa during summer season for 6 days trip. Love this castle so much especially the outlook. It is so much different from the other castle in Japan. Elegant and fascinating castle.Visited on June 2019.
214,Beautiful. Relaxing. Historic. A treat for your eyes.,Impressive fortress. High on a hill. Gorgeous restoration of red lacquered walls.  Dragons are everywhere as the kings symbol. I wish I could see it completed! Go. The grounds are also beautiful and it’s close to the station!
215,Interesting + great views over the city,"My husband and I visited a few years ago, but didn't get to visit Shurijo Castle. Second time we were in Naha, we made it a priority however. Sadly... The castle was under renovation on the outside :/ But... Visit if you want to see a national treasure and learn more about the Ryukyu kingdom. It is not necessary to know Japanese to read the signs and such, but it helps in some places."
216,Beautiful castle,"need to visit in naha, memorial place of ancient Ryukyu kingdomyou can undertand the history with korea, japan and china in Suri"
217,Beautiful castle with unique architecture,"We visited this very interesting restored Japanese castle on a recent cruise call to Naha, Okinawa. We caught the monorail from the shuttle bus drop off point, (a day pass for the monorail was Y800) and the castle was at the final stop. There was very little signposting but we could see where we were heading and we eventually found our way although it took us about 15 to 20 minutes.The outer parts of the castle and the grounds are free to enter; there is a gift shop, small restaurant and public toilets adjacent to the car park. The toilets are western type (thank goodness!) with extra buttons for douche, dry and music - very civilised!!We climbed upwards to the main part of the castle, it was a steep path with some steps but there was a disabled access available. We paid Y660 entry fee for the castle which was a one way circuit around the exhibits and included videos, reconstructed rooms and some models.There was also a Japanese tea room and we had unlimited jasmine tea with 5 small cakes for Y300. We sat at a communal table and one of the waitresses gave a talk about the food and drink we were enjoying - there was an English translation in the menu which was a great help!You have to remove your shoes before entering the castle, just as you would in any Japanese home so its a good idea to either take slippers or wear socks - I had to pad around in my bare feet and felt a bit uncomfortable. There are lockers for your shoes and other belongings in the tea house, otherwise you just carry your shoes around with you in the provided plastic bag. The castle gardens are worth a visit too, with lots of fruit treesThis was a great experience, we were there for almost 3 hours and had an excellent time!"
218,Well-preserved,"This castle is a reminder of the feudal country of old. Lovingly restored after damage during WW2, it is a glimpse into the past and offers up some of the history of the region. well worth the walk as it offers great views out over the harbour and surrounding city."
219,Stamp collecting,We had a great time as a couple but believe it would be a good time with the children.  We were able to walk through the whole thing without difficulty.  A must see when visiting Okinawa!
220,Shurijo Castle,"Shurjio Castle is by far one of the most unique World Heritage Sites I've visited and one of the most majestic and artistic castles built. With its outstanding bright red color it is indeed a work of art. Located in Shuri, Okinawa built between 1429 and 1879 during the Gusuku period it is a Ryukyuan palace made of limestone and wood with heavy Chinese architecture influence. We took bus 9 from Naha Station or you could also take the monorail and alight at Shuri Station. There is entrance ticket that costs about 870 Yen and it is very worth it. It is perfect to visit the castle just before the sunset for a perfect viewing and sunset photo. The main entrance stands Shureimon Gate that leads to the castle park. As you walk by to your right passing the Gusuku (fortress) stands at the top of the hill is the castle's main hall or Seiden. The Una Plaza stands in front of the seiden which serves as ceremonial hall. Inside the castle you could view the main throne and several rooms which truly embodies its Ryukyuan interior design. Outside as you walk there is the observatory called Iri No Azana, which has a 360 degree view of Naha and bird's eye view of the castle complex which is truly amazing and beautiful. Here we took the best sunset shots and videos which are truly remarkable. It is also not that very high to climb up perhaps around 20 to 30 steps only. The castle at sunset is truly historical and romantic and it is not very crowded with tourists. It was such a lovely and memorable trip here at Shurijo castle, so if you visit Okinawa this is a must to see!!! :=)"
221,Memories of a glorious past,A good rebuilt place to know the history of the majesty of the early Okinawa. The buildings are also beautiful. It is a good point to connect with my South East Asia experience.
222,Not A Typical Japanese Castle,"Unfortunately it was raining when I visited, but might have been a thing as there wasn't many people. Outside they had a performance of traditional dances which was awesome. Highly recommend seeing it. Love how the route is well posted and information are in multiple languages."
223,Facade under refurbishment,"The kids have a good time exploring the castle. The video in the exhibit room/ waiting area is very informative, showing how the reformed work is done."
224,Overpriced and underwhelming,"Shurijo Castle is a must see in Okinawa. Easily accessible by taxi or monorail. Free entry. Part of castle burnt last year and undergoing renovations, but still lots to see and many photo worthy vistas. Much history and period architecture along with lush botanical gardens and some wildlife ex. ducks, koi fish, egrets, birds and the occasional snake. Again you must visit Shurijo castle while In Okinawa."
225,Must see,I am glad that we stopped by while in Okinawa. Great views and very informative displays throughout. Be prepared to take off your shoes to enter the castle if you decide to go in. Very nice grounds to look at.
226,Definitely worth a stop,"Words that describe the castle include clean, quiet, traditional, ancient, empty,  elegant, less is more.  After you purchase a ticket and you begin to walk through the castle you must remove your shoes.  it is very typical of shrines that people remove shoes in indoor exhibits.  The Castle offered a vision of life of the Ryukyu culture.  this castle was reconstructed after the destruction of Okinawa.  I loved the royal rooms with teh lacquer chairs and beautiful paintings and artifacts.Some rooms were sparcely decorated .  I think we were not allowed to take pictures.  Visiting the castle from the cruise ship means you will neeed to take a taxi.  it was not a conventient walk.  in the castle area one person that I went with had back problems so it was difficult walking around the area.  It is good to see but I would not rush back to see it again."
227,Long legs needed!,"I walked along the wall of castle 2 times in 2 days, 1 in daytime and 1 in the evening. It's a magnificent castle!"
228,Famous Castle yet sadly disappointing.,"Interesting walk about, paid extra to go inside.  We were on th Jumbo hip hop bus tour.  Didn’t get to spend a lot here but beside the building and grounds there were shops to purchase souvenirs and ample spots for photos."
229,Great experience,Their service towards wheelchair accessibility is amazing.The view from the top is beautiful & calming
230,Need more signage,"This is the birthplace of Karate and Passadai kata..you can see why katas are orchestrated in 2 steps side and 3 or more down because of the passage ways and corridors are long and narrow. The ambiance and general feeling of the main king of Okinawa set in this castle offers unique and authentic layout of how the castle was in the 1400’s with the court and throne with fabulous artifacts such as weapons and the crown, information for the tourist or local.. I found it exciting even for my second time round..the gift shop offers T-shirt’s and other gifts revolved around karate and a cafe to have refreshments. The monorail is also wonderful to travel there from Naha at a cheap price. When you visit other castle which were ruined by the war you can see the great restoration that has occurred at the castle to preserve this great piece of history."
231,Castle,"There’s a man who’s sole job is to straighten used plastic shoe bags! Let me explain. Upon entering the castle proper via the “usual route” (Tip for you fellas out there- don’t make the joke that ‘this is how I refer to you as sometimes honey’ to your wife- she will not talk to for hours) you are asked to take your shoes off and keep them with you in a plastic bag. You go about the beautiful red, adorned and tatami strewn castle which houses an enormous throne which the missus and I hypothesize was needed as most of the Ryuku emperors were probably as obese as Mr. Kinjo (Okinawans and travelers will understand) and then at the end you put your shoes back on and hand the plastic bag to a man who straightens the bag out for cleaning and then reuse. HE MUST BE THE ONLY MAN ON THE PLANET THAT USES ATHLETE’S FOOT ON HIS HANDS! It raised so many questions for me and I wanted to ask him but my missus dragged me away before I could make mincemeat of my broken Nihongo in trying to ascertain any answers. How did he get this job? Who is he?!"
232,"Very beautiful, very peaceful",We took the monorail to Shurijo station. And it took us more than 20 minutes to walk to the castle. The first entrance is free but to enter the main building you will have to buy a ticket 850 yen. But the wiev over Naha is free.
233,Been there twice in 20 years.  It was a great feeling being back.,No need to purchase tickets ... Just walk the grounds and learn the history.  No admission fee to walk all of the grounds.Stairs are steep -elderly be careful.We rented kimonos and took pictures throughout.
234,A different slice of Japan,"we visited Shurijo Castle in the just 15 mins before the ticket counter closed , at nearly 6;30 in the evening , the castle closes at 7;30 we had to remove our shoes and generally explore the place , the the architecture is beautiful and the  place has a nice feel to it , the emperor's throne is there and photography is allowed."
235,Populated and nothing fantastic,Huge ancient castle in vast area on top of a high hill. Well preserved castle with many interest features . A complementary traditional Okinawa folk dances on the outside courtyard
236,A highlight of Naha,"Panoramic views of Naha. So, so interesting. Preserved well. Easy to park underneath...don't bother with the hawker parking lots. Stop and enjoy the green tea and take in the garden. Worth it. Wasn't too crowded, later in the day...probably added to our enjoyment."
237,"Great place to visit, loved it!","I'm not too big a history fan but everytime I'm travelling, I'll try to see something historical. This time it was Shurijo Castle and I must say I'm happy we went there.Being an European, our castles are something completely different and this was like a refreshing breeze. The castle itself did not have too many old items but it was more like the building itself where the tour focused.We visited the castle on a sunny day and as some areas are outdoors, this was the right day. The only minor disadvantage were big tourist groups as sometimes it felt there was too much people. Tour also offered a possibility to enjoy some tea and local cookies/bisquets with small additional fee."
238,Quite a sacred castle,"Step into the past and experience Okinawa in the 14th century.  The architecture, flair, and culture are in living color in the many displays and life characters on the grounds.  Fascinating history destination and easy to get to from Naha.  There is an entrance fee but well worth it."
239,Impressive Castle,"We were curious about ryukyu culture. The visit allowed us to understand how different Okinawa is from mainland Japan, while having many similarities.The castle is much more beautiful than in pictures. The exhibition of ancient traditional kimonos, Japanese etchings, weaponry and music instrument is magnificent."
240,Restored Castle,"There are many buildings on Okinawa which have had to be restored due to Japan's war-storied past. This castle is one of them, and I expected to be underwhelmed but I was wrong. One should not associate the word restoration with ""lacking in detail"". The architectural work and interiors are stunning, and the tour through the castle was very interesting. The Japanese are very big on not trampling through public access buildings with your footwear on. Be advised, that you will be given a plastic bag to carry your shoes through the building. (They do recycle the bags at the exit to the building. It appears they reuse what they can.) The grounds themselves are simple, yet somehow still grand. I feel the history pulsing through the grounds. It's hard to imagine how much has happened there. Go. You'll enjoy Shurijo Castle."
241,Must see,"Last April was my first and last time that I had a chance to visit this Ryukyuan splendor. Although the main structure was destroyed in fire, I highly recommend to visit the site to check out the surrounding structures which remain intact."
242,Shurijo castle in vast area with folk dances,"This is a highlight.  Don't forget to go and have the tea and cookies (a small charge). Is beautiful to see.  If your at a hotel along the monorail, it goes near to it (15 minute walk)."
243,Splendid,"A must visit if you would like to learn a bit of history about Ryukyu/Okinawa, learn how the islander survived and thrived under the influence of two powerful nations, Japan and China and how the architecture and culture are influenced.We had to rush through the castle because we were with a Cruise Ship organized tour. Choose a date when no Cruise Ship are in town, if you could."
244,Birthday Trip,"This is a walking, self-guided tour that is very well organized.  Wonderfully maintained buildings and interesting artifacts. The views from atop the surrounding walls are beautiful.  There are some accommodations getting around the main building for those with strollers or mobility issues.  However to get to the top of the wall you have to maneuver a good sized stone stairway.On the property (or across the pathway) there is a building with a restaurant, gift store and some kind of smoothie café.  Outsider there a several stalls with souvenirs and ice cream.Visit does not take long, so it would be good for a half day if you need to fill some time."
245,Time Travel to 14th Century Okinawa.,Worthwhile visiting. A short teabreak with local cookies removes the hurry from the day. You can combine this with a visit to Tamaudin.
246,Mr Albert,"Whilst there are many free-to-view cultural assets to see on the climb up to Shurijo Castle, entry to the 'Paid Admission Zone' of the Castle itself costs Y820.  If you travelled to Shuri on the Monorail using  a 1-Day or 2-Day Pass, you can get a significant reduction (c. 20%) to Y660, on production of the Pass.  Entry to this Zone gives you access to the red and white paved quadrangle where you can view the colourful and stylish 'Seiden' - the centrepiece of the Shurijo Castle structures, and to a self-guided tour internally of the rooms.Dating back to the 14th Century, the brilliant colours and distinctive Ryukyuan architecture shows both Chinese and Japanese influences.  Left in ruins after the Battle of Okinawa, the Castle was totally rebuilt/restored based on an 18th Century model.  As much as I admired the vermillion and gilded opulence and polished wood interiors, there are some 'cons', including;- even on a dull and overcast mid-week January day, the #1 attraction in Naha seems to attracts hordes of visitors,- as a senior travelling solo, I tend rely on my camera to record my travels and the enforcement of 'no photography' rules (internally) denies me of these memories.Notwithstanding these, .... Would I go back again on a future visit?  I certainly would!"
247,Organized and clear,"Although the original castle is no more, this painstakingly recreated replica is most impressive. The history behind the castle and surrounding grounds is fascinating. I visited on a Friday and it was crowded but not packed. There were quite a few school groups. Once inside, crowd control is in place and everything is very organized. While there are some exhibits within the castle, it is the craftsmanship that is the highlight here. Be sure to see the miniature replica on display. There are several buildings that are part of the complex - each one served its own function and offers a distinct uniqueness. The displays are in Japanese, Chinese and English (I think Korean, too) and are well written giving the viewer a feel for what life was like during the castle’s heyday in Ryukyuan culture. Prepare to spend a good two hours here. I recommend combining a visit with nearby Ryutan Pond and Shuri Kinjo-cho Ishidatami (narrow, old stone street)."
248,Impressive Restoration,Shurijo Castle is great place to understand Okinawa’s history and influence of Chinese and Japanese cultures on it. It can reached by bus or Yui train line. There is entry fee. We could use non step tour path for most the visit. We could see meticulous work done to restore the castle which was damaged in battle of Okinawa. It may take 1-2 hours. Great place to visit!!
249,"Unique castle, stamp collecting game",Fun to run around collecting stamps. Tip: have a one day monorail pass for a small discountPs. Its dumb to make people write reviews of at least 100 characters
250,A must to go place in Naha ,"This is where Okinawa culture meets Chinese culture. The structures are very grand and the colors and details of Chinese influence is evident. For the kids, there are several stamp stations where you collect stamps treasure-hunt style to get a reward at the end."
251,Magnificant although it's re-build,"Well maintained Japanese old castle belongs kingdom of Ryukyu. During my business trip, I visited here and i felt very happy because they are well maintaining there historical place."
252,Great for the whole family ,Relaxing and informative trip.  One of many places we visited. Most displays had English translations.
253,Day date with the husband,"Shurijo Castle is about 20mins away from Kokusai Street. We decided to take a taxi instead since it was not very convenient go there by public transport. The entire compound is quite huge. If you are keen to participate in the stamp rally (where you can get a souvenir if you complete a number of stations), I would recommend at least 1.5 hours. We managed to get a sticker souvenir for completing the minimum number of stations. The castle was partially under renovation as at Nov 2018."
254,Highly recommend to spend a could of hours here,If you can't climb lots of stairs (lots - a whole lot) - you may want to skip this place. It was very beautiful once up there and the views were great but there were a lot of stairs to climb to get there. Also if you go - wear clean socks since you have to take your shoes off!
255,Big castle,"Nice place to visit for a cultural tour. Our students gained an appreciation of Okinawa history, architecture, etc."
256,memorial place in naha,"Accesible and informative, as well. Not far from Naha city center. Good way to learning from Okinawa's history. I would recommending taking the Yu Rail Day pass, if previously purchased, as a discount is applied upon presentation."
257,Shuri Castle,"A replica of the 14th century fortress, which was destroyed in WW II, on a central hilltop overlooking the China Sea.  The fortress has multiple buildings and massive entrance gates.  In the grand courtyard the Chinese architectural influence is evident in the red colour and many details. A tour of the interior, where you will need to remove your shoes, finds many period artifacts along with   the throne of King  Ryukyuan."
258,A must to understand history of Okinawa,"Our kids joined the stamping activity to earn a gift at the end of the experience. When they went to the service counter to exchange for the gift, the service staff was extremely rude, greeted them with black face, threw the gift at our kids and then chase them away while we were trying to unwrap the gift. Later on, a Japanese lady approached her for directions, she was nice and polite. It was clearly a discrimination against non-locals, and moreover this is a tourist location, I would expect to treat everyone equally and with basic courtesy at least. Will not recommend for anyone to visit this space."
259,Ancient castle wall and refined palace ,"I went to okinawa just about every year, and in 2019 twice, july and november. The last time I went to shuri castle was in 2018, after that in 2019 because of electrical malfunctions fire destroyed most all of the buildings specially the main one. But, they are trying to rebuild little by little just like in the past."
260,Totally worth it,"Located not too far away from the Shuri monorail station, the castle rises red, perched up above the city. As with most places in Naha, the castle was rebuilt completely after the war, but this does not detract from an impressive structure. Definitely worth a visit on a clear…"
261,Beautiful place,"Our family spent a couple of hours at Shurijo, a UNESCO World Heritage site, during our time in Naha. The castle was rebuilt fairly recently, but is still interesting to tour as a historical site and learn about the Ryukyu royalty who once ruled there. There is no photography allowed inside most of the castle itself, so be sure to put your cameras away when you see the signs near the front entry. (We saw staff enforce the rule with tourists not abiding them.) The views from the top of the castle grounds are sweeping. They have a ""passport"" activity for kids, where kids can stamp their paper at various stations on the grounds. Once completed, they turn it in for a small prize. My child really enjoyed looking for the stations and it helped us make sure we saw everything."
262,Not worth to visit ,"Unfortunately, we came at a time when it was overly crowded and the place was under construction. The main area was not as majestic as on pictures and this place was the only attraction we visited and felt rather disappointed for."
263,It's a replica and Under renovation,"Walked from Shuri monorail station on a very humid day. About 15-20 minute walk that was well marked. The front of the castle is being relaquered and is wrapped up. Very crowded with school children and cruise ship passengers today. Much of the signage has English descriptions. Most of the castle was destroyed in WW2 and has been rebuilt. Excellent education in the history of Okinawa,"
264,Any visit to Okinawa should include a trip to Shuri Jo and the surroundings,Best non guided tour ever experienced Enjoyed the extra experience of tea serviceReally enjoyed the leisurely way we were able to enjoy this treasure of okinawa
265,Great and magnificent ,Better than I expected. We were late and missed their last performance at 4pm. The walk into the park is free unless you want to enter inside the castle.Had the benefit of both day and night view. Have some steep steps n slopes too.
266,Met Expectations,"On our first day on Okinawa, we decided to take the Yui Rail Naha City Monorail to visit the Shuri Castle.  It was the last stop on the line.  The short walk to the castle felt a lot farther because it was such a hot and humid day.  There isn't much shade between the station and…"
267,Nice Park for a Stroll and Pictures,Good view from the lookout point. Castle is okay. Not too crowded. Stroller friendly with elevators and ramps added to help get around
268,Shurijo Castle,"A replica of the 14th century fortress on a central hilltop which overlooked the South China Sea. It was the royal castle of the Ryukyu Empire and was the largest castle in Okinawa.  It has multiple buildings, massive entrance gates with a grand courtyard.  Just beautiful.   One…"
269,Nice place but not many activity,"Loads of steps to navigate. Someone with longer legs than I have will have no problem clamboring over the big steps. It was a great place to see, though. The gardens were beautiful and the day magnificent. Take water."
270,Nothing special ,Nothing like other Japanese castles - offers great insight into the unique culture of the Ryukyu Islands. A must when visiting Okinawa!
271,Might be Boring for Kids,"I'm glad we went. It was a nice day to stroll around and I can say I've been, but I wouldn't go again and I think most kids will be bored. Our favorite part of the site was exploring the grounds in search of stamp pads to stamp a souvenir map. If you collect all the stamps, you receive a nice gift of a small plastic folder, stickers, a coloring book, and a special stamp. Upon reaching the paid, museum area, you are handed a plastic bag to carry your shoes. You tour the castle and museum in your bare feet. As others have commented, the castle just has a lot of empty rooms that look alike, limited captions, and not much else.There's an inexpensive cafe where we enjoyed a corn dog and fried rice. Both were good, but clearly just re-heated in a microwave.Free covered parking is available, lockers that you can rent for 100 yen that is returned to you after you return the key. The gift shops contained standard Okinawa souvenirs - nothing very unique to just the castle."
272,UNESCO Historical Site,"The ticket price is 800 YEN/Adult, if you have one day or two days pass fot Yui Rail the price is 600 YEN only. You have to buy this ticken at cash desk only(not in vending machine)."
273,A Castle that’s unique to Okinawa ,"Interesting historic site that tells the story of the rise and fall of Ryukyu kingdom, and its relationship with neighboring countries.Many areas of the castle are free to enter. There’s a modest fee to explore the inside of the castle."
274,Exploring ,"very interesting palatial grounds similar to the Imperial Palace of Beijing on a smaller scale . Quite a bit of uphill walking but it is ok if you take it nice and slow.  it is worthwhile the walk up , as you can see clear view of Naha city and the ocean from the top.Remember to stamp the programme sheet as you go along  (about 6-7 spots ), and you will be rewarded a small souvenir pack of colourful stickers and story book on the castle"
275,UNESCO historical site,"If you get the one or two-day monorail pass (buy from the machine at any monorail station, including the airport), this is really easy to access.  It's the last stop (#15) on the Yui Rail monorail, which runs every 10 minutes from 6 am to 11:30 pm.  The castle is about a 15 minute walk from there, much of it uphill.  The grounds are lovely, the employees pleasant and enthusiastic, and the castle interesting, although it is currently being re-lacquered and there is scaffolding everywhere.  The tour takes about 45 minutes, and be advised that you will need to remove your shoes,  Most, but not all of the signage has English translations.  Great photo ops (at sunset especially and at night when lit up) and interesting history of Okinawa's indigenous people.  Be sure to check out the mausoleum as well.  It's only 100 m from the castle.  Both have discounts if you have the one or two-day monorail pass.  If you're hungry for a full meal after and you want authentic Okinawan food, Ryukyu Sabo Ashibiuna is a 5 minute walk from the castle."
276,Worth a visit,"I’m not a history buff and not that into castles.  But this place was definitely worth walking to for the views of Okinawa.  I suggest taking the train to Shuri (last stop), walk through and then down the other side, so you can look at how the locals nearby live, then finally…"
277,Full of history,We used the monorail to get here and walked. Stopped off at a Dim Sum restaurant on the corner on the way from the monorail for the nicest lunch with a beautiful set menu. Walked round the castle and the grounds. Wasn't too busy the day we went and we had time and space to explore and take photos.
278,You have to go see this!,Opens much later than some tourist sites. Ranked 11th on Japan’s UNESCO site.Recommended duration is about an hour. Quite a walk (upslope) from Shuri / Gino station.
279,Great cultural experience,Easy to access via monorail and bus from my hotel. The bus and taxi option from monorail station each cost about the same if you have 4-5 persons (including children). The bus has a fixed schedule. Taxi option meant you don’t have to wait for the bus. It’s worth a visit to learn more about Okinawa’s history.
280,Great Castle to visit for a foreigner who likes exploring,"Although the monorail station named of the castle, but it get a distance of walk from the station, 10-15 minutes approximately. Bus or car is rather recommended (3-5 min walk distance). The castle is well rebuild. Pay for the entrance fee and then you'll get inside to read the story of Ryukyu empire. The art inside is beutiful, but not allowed for photography. There is a must try tea cafe inside, but many people were in qeue."
281,A Unique Castle,"This Unesco world heritage is a former palace of the kings of Ryukyu who ruled Okinawa islands for many centuries.  Under China’s rule for centuries before transferred to Japan, the palace appearance is Chinese style more than Japanese style architecture. Outside and some of interior are Chinese architecture but the interior remained Japanese architecture with simplicity and nature as key design ideas. Recommend."
282,Absolutely breathtaking,"A very enjoyable few hours. Fascinating, and joined a free tour, which was very informative. Even the kids learnt something!"
283,Barrier free :),"On southern side of naha city. 10 to 15 minutes from central naha. Take the train to suri station. Then walk 15 minutes to main entrance. However, you could take short cut. About 50 m after  post office, there is a sign to turn left into a parking area. You can use that short cut to lake on right then walk towards the castle and main entrance. Otherwise it is a long walk to main entrance. There is no sign but once you see the postiffice after walking from suri station. 100m you see post office. Then 50 m,  turn left and u can see the castke on top of hill. There are many sites within the castle park. Each stop u can stamp the location. About 24 stopover points. Kids get excited stamping on the map. They will give u a map with blank space at the ticket counter. From castle top see okinawa city. Quite amazing, the castle had been restored so more modern looking. U have to take off shoes before entering the main castle where you see where the king sleeps , etc. So wear socks. They will give u a bag to put your shoes. Do not take photos inside. There are signs. If you enjoy history, you will like it. If you want a relaxing walk, you will like it, if you are not physically strong, then you will not like to walk. Enjoy a piece of history."
284,Highlight trip in Naha,Read a review previously about the underground parking at Shurijo Castle. The parking fee was ¥320 per entry. It was SUPER cheap compared to other parking lot around the Shurijo Castle. Therefore search for underground parking at Shurijo Castle using Google Maps (keyword: Shureimon Gate)The weather was nice:) so we get to took a few nice family pictures. Than we spent some time walking inside the castle (it was a replica by the way as the original building was destroyed during WW2.) The access in the place was very friendly towards people with stroller and wheelchair. Almost barrier free at every section we went! Really grateful for that. I gave 3 stars because it was quite disappointing to see a replica as a world heritage site.
285,A slice of Ryukyu,Will be nice if you able to spend a day onsite. Just to chill out and enjoy the scene and show of the local dance at the park.
286,Full of tourist,"Impressive castle, quite interesting blend of architecture of Japanese and Chinese, fact which seems dominates Okinawan culture overall. Well worth a visit."
287,A bit of history in modern Naha.,"With architectural influences of both China and Japan, this Castle shows its cultural and historical values in its stonework and architectural design, Shurijo was designated as a World Heritage Site in December of 2000, the 11th World Heritage Site within Japan. The Castle served as the centre of Ryukyu Kingdom and its politics, foreign affairs and culture. Okinawa was an independent country, before being annexed by Japan in 1879. Recent World War 2 history saw the castle and just about everything on Okinawa blown to hell and over two thirds of its population wiped out. Every building in Okinawa is new. This castle is an amazing reproduction. A visit to the castle teaches about the kingdom and the Kings who governed it during a particular period of history. Entry cost is reasonable, as it has been made a world heritage site. You will need to remove your shoes and carry them in a bag, while you walk through the reconstructed interior parts of the castle. This will preserve the wooden surfaces for future generations. I loved the battlements and seeing their layout and the fact that the castle is built on the top of a steep hill, shows the invincability of the Kingdom. A visit is highly recommended."
288,Large underground carpark,"From the minute you walk onto the property, you know there is something special about this place.  The entire property is so well kept and manicured that it will leave you in awe.  I would highly recommend the tour of the inside."
289,Enjoyable Afternoon,"Shurijo Castle is about a 15 - 20 mins drive from Kokusai Dori (the international shopping street) The castle is made up of several buildings surrounding a big main square. The beautiful buildings were well preserved with very unique and interesting architecture and exhibits inside.After exploring the castle buildings you can take a walk outside to view the castle walls and external gardens. There are some steps and slopes to navigate along the way but nothing too steep.A pleasant way to spend the morning (2 hours or so) visiting one of Okinawa's main attractions. After visiting the castle you can visit a nearby Japanese wine making shop, the Awamori Zuisen Distillery, about 4 mins away by car and from there to a quaint Okinawan restaurant nearby called Ryukyu Sabo Ashibiuna for lunch."
290,UNESCO site,"Shurijo Castle Park New Year’s CelebrationThe New Year ceremony observed at Shurijo Castle on New Year's Day during the Ryukyu Kingdom era was called ""Chohai-Okishiki"" (morning worshiping regulation). The King and other officials of the Ryukyu Royal Court lined up in the courtyard and participated in a solemn traditional Chinese ceremony. Please enjoy the New Year 's Day of the Ryukyu Kingdom, which welcomes the New Year with gorgeous and vivid colors.You can see it from Jan 1 to Jan 3.also you can enjoy to see the beautiful ""Bingata"" which mean,Okinawa traditional kimono.and other traditional performance such as ""sanshin"", ""shishimai"" and something like this."
291,Must visit,"We arrived here by car and were immediately guided to our parking spot by multiple traffic attendants. As soon as you go up via the escalators, you enter the park. The building where you exit has multiple information desks and stands where you could get your information and pamphlet for the scavenger hunt for stamps. When you've completed the scavenger hunt, you'll even get extra free stickers as reward. Surprised by this little activity, we scoured the area. The park was well maintained, and we particularly enjoyed the view from the observation deck. As we got something to drink from the machine in one of the little houses, a nice lady also informed us that ""in two minutes"" a performance would start at the outside of the area, and it would be nice for us to see. She was right, and we enjoyed the two traditional dances performed by people in traditional costume and make-up. After the dance we entered the castle, where we were welcomed by a large but tidy courtyard. Unfortunately the front side of the castle was under restoration, but they did put a banner with a picture of the castle (which was quite humorous to me). On the inside, we had to take off our shoes (they provided us with a plastic bag) and toured the many historical goods. Further into the castle, we even had tea and snacks in the tea area. This was particularly enjoyable, as you had a fantastic view on the back garden while snacking on some nice sweets with Jasmin tea. After the tea, we continued scouring the castle and visited the grounds. In the park there was additionally a visitor questionnaire, where we were asked to answer a few questions in return for a post card of the castle. This showed me the were continuously working on improving the castle grounds on accessibility and guidance for visitors."
292,Informative Site,"The route is from the Mashiki Station.Take the monorail to Shuri station or you can also go to Gibo Station as well (the stop before Shuri and might be easier to get to the castle from Gibo).  Which is a twelve minute monorail ride.  From Gibo station you head straight south for around a ten to fifteen minute walk.  From Shuri station it will be just a little longer and you have to head south/ west.  Also harder to get to the castle, because the streets to get there, is more difficult.  Also Google maps was having a problem on the route to getting us there.When you get to your destination, there will be a few vendors selling ice cream and other trinkets, on the grounds.  This is in the middle of the observation area on one side, and a pathway on the other, which takes you to the castle.Check out the observation area first.  Really great views and you can even get a nice selfie, with Shurijo Castle in your background.It costs you maybe ten to twelve dollars to get into the castle grounds and the castle.The grounds are immaculate, the architecture is incredible, and it is such a great place to see a part of history.If you like castles and you're in Naha, then you should check this place out.  Very great experience and I enjoyed it very much."
293,Nice to walk around,"Former residence of Ryukyu Kingdom rulers, destroyed couple of times in the past, most recently during battle of Okinawa. Rebuilt nowadays and most of the rooms are open to public. It takes around hour or so to visit them all. Exhibits are well described in English. There are free guided tours every two hours or so. Well worth spending 680 JPY (after discount for presenting day pass of monorail)."
294,Beautiful castle,"World heritage site. It tells the history of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Admission is 820 yen per person. The hall of the throne is very beautiful as well as the gardens. Pay parking in the nearby. Toilette,  vending machines and shops.The view at night is quite impressive."
295,Enjoyable walk around the grounds,"Shirijo Castle became the royal seat of government for King Sho Hashi (who united the kingdom) in 1406.  It remained the heart of politics, foreign diplomacy, and culture of the Ryukyu Kingdom for 500 years, until the last ruler, King Sho Tai, abdicated to the Meiji government.  It is an amazing fortress with multiple massive gates and buildings.  It sits on top of a hill and provides a great view over the city and down to the China Sea.  If you see nothing else in Okinawa, you owe it to yourself to see this—especially if history is important to you."
296,Large compound-- impressive historical site,"Arriving at Naha Port, Okinawa as part of our Maasdam cruise encircling Japan, we taxied($5) 1.4 km south during the early morning in this capital of 320,000, arriving at Meibashi Monorail Station in 15 minutes. We purchased tickets($3 each) before boarding for 8 stops, exiting at Shurijo Station. The 1 km path was well marked to this 2000 designated UNESCO site, the King's Residence of the Kingdom of Ryukyu. While the rebuilt castle and its massive walls are the focus of the large parkland, we also wanted to see the portal gates, tombs, sacred grove and surrounding gardens.We returned to the monorail to backtrack 4 stops to Omoromachi Station and walked 750 m northwest to the excellent Okinawa Prefecture Museum for its displays of Okinawan folklore and arts/crafts. After visiting the new City Hall, we returned to the port by taxi($6), making for a full and rewarding morning."
297,Worth to see it....,"Shurijo Castle in Naha, destroyed during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, was rebuilt after the war. It’s now a UNESCO World Heritage site. A 15-minute walk from the nearest monorail station, this should be on your must-see list if you ever come to Naha."
298,Beautiful & Picturesque,"Shuri Castle in Shuri, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Between 1429 and 1879, it was the palace of the Ryukyu Kingdom, before becoming largely neglected. In 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa, it was almost completely destroyed. After the war, the castle was re-purposed as a university campus. Beginning in 1992, the central citadel and walls were largely reconstructed on the original site based on historical records, photographs, and memory. On the morning of 31 October 2019, the main courtyard structures of the castle were again destroyed in a fire.  We saw the castle in a ruined state but hopefully when restored, I will see it at it's beauty."
299,Worth Visiting in Naha!,"찾기도 쉽고, 주차하기도 쉽고, 오키나와에서 제일 높은 곳에 있는 공원이라 가족들과 산책하며 오키나와의 역사를 알기 좋은 곳입니다.easy to find, easy to park a car. it is at the highest point in okinawa. you can learn history on a nice walk in the park with your family."
