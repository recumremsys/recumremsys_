0,Limited covid tour,"We had been wanting to visit this vessel for many years. The tour was good but we were a bit disappointed to miss quite a few sections, which were closed due to covid restrictions. If you have be waiting to visit this, like we have, I’d maybe delay your visit."
1,Even One Hour Was Great,It was a nice tour as there are many volunteer veterans telling stories. It was great to see the ship but we were disappointed that the tour is extremely limited to only the hangar deck and the flight deck due to Covid-19. They haven't reduced the price accordingly.
2,It was so much fun!!,I have toured a few Navy vessels and this is the best.  We arrived early to purchase tickets and had a very short wait.  There are senior and military discounts at the window.  Once aboard we were handed a audio tour instrument which is activated at various points throughout the ship. We headed straight to the bridge as later in the day this area involves a long wait.  From there it was on to areas below deck.  I think the only thing we might have missed was the engine room although not sure it was accessible to the public.  The aircraft displays on and below deck were very interesting and informative.
3,Uss midway ,Our family truly enjoyed our visit to the USS Midway.  It was very interesting and we especially loved all the veterans and volunteers who helped with the tours and put on talks.   Don't miss this piece of history.
4,USS Midway tour,"It was nice to visit the uss midway for the 2nd time, although very disappointed that many of the tour sections were closed and off limits."
5,US Midway - excellent day adventure,"We thought we would visit this museum for an hour or 2 and stayed for 4.  It was an amazing experience.  We started with the tour that commences at the bridge.  This was a smart thing to do because it gave you a deep understanding of the boat, the planes and her achievements. After that we spent the next 3 hours looking around, speaking to the volunteers who are all ex-service people and then we stumbled onto another highlight - a presentation of how the planes land on the deck.  This also a must see - the tent where this is held is in the centre of the runway deck.  You cant miss it. Finally, finish with the video re; the Battle of Midway.  It is in the cinema on the middle level of the boat.  It is exceptionally moving!!! Must Do: 1. The formal tour.2. Grab and use the audio set3. The presentation on how to land on deck4. Cinema experience  - Battle of Midway."
6,Nice very limited tour due to Covid-19,We purchased our tickets ahead of time & were glad to skip the line. The audio-tour provides great information and insight. Presenters on the flight deck gave additional information. Wear comfortable shoes & be prepared to walk & climb stairs.
7,Glorious History ,We visited the Midway pre-COVID-19 and were able to tour the ship comfortably.  It was fascinating and displays were great.   My sons loved getting close to the planes and listening to the docents who are veterans sharing their experiences.
8,About as good as it gets,"My daughter and I decided to visit the USS Midway. We weren't sure we would stay very long because of our interest level, but the visit was surprisingly fun. We did not buy our tickets in advance and arrived at the entrance 20 minutes before the attraction opened and purchased our tickets within minutes. While waiting on line, we were given advice to head up to the flight deck to take the Guided Island Tour first because it tends to get busy. After that we wandered through what seemed like the entire ship and saw many of the exhibits, movies, and talks. It was fun to sit in several of the jet fighters and other aircraft units. The free self guided audio tour was helpful as well as the many explanations from knowledgeable Midway volunteers.  We stayed so long that we purchased lunch at the cafe and ate outside on a deck that had seating. It was very pleasant and gave us a break from all the walking. We must have been there over 4 hours. I wasn't sure it would be a must see as others have said, but I do agree now."
9,Very Stately,"Really enjoyed it. We had only an hour to do something local & we were glad we chose the Midway Museum. Though some areas were closed due to COVID, there we still so many interesting things to see. The volunteers were great; super informative & seemed quiet happy to be able to share their knowledge. They didn't push us through, and we could wander wherever we chose. Can get hot & bright on the top deck, with amazing views of the water & the city.  Ideally, set aside at least two hours to explore. If you're a factoid junkie, you can easily spend 3+ hours listening to audio commentary and just looking at planes, choppers, muintions, and operational gadgets. Even my wife --who is a great sport, but doesn't dig museums like i do -- really enjoyed it. Bathrooms were accessible. We didn't get to the gift shop, but there appeared to be endless products. Also, you can buy a commemorative photo at the end. Proceeds support the museum. Our kids are grown, but if we had school-aged kids or teens, I'd go for it as it's big and there's plenty of walking & touching & learning if ya want. If we get to SD again, we'll likely go again!"
10,So much to see,"I would like to suggest everybody to visit this museum when visiting San Diego. We learned a lot in our 3 hours' visit. It is like the combination of an aviation museum and a ship museum. My daughter, a teenager, was so interested that she did not  want to leave until the museum was closed for the day."
11,Do this to complete the American experience,"Practically everybody gives this attraction 5 stars and it deserves it. On Saturday we spent 4 hours touring the ship . We were staying across the street so we came back for free the next day ( make sure you get the pass) On Sunday ,we spent another 3 hours there. The yellow hats are volunteers who in most cases served in the service and in some cases on the Midway. They love telling stories and are very passionate about what they do. On Sunday we had one as a personal guide for 1.5 hours as he explained what he did on board and the dynamics of the operation. For the most part, they do not worry about being political correct and we found that refreshing. We plan on going back ,since it is nearby."
12,Old sailor vistis,"This past weekend, we spent two delightful hours on the Midway. We were very impressed with how the information was presented and the ability to walk around the ship and see a variety of aircraft. Unfortunately, the Covid pandemic prevented us from observing everything that a normal tour entails.We suggest you buy your tickets online the day before your visit."
13,Always a Sight To See,We enjoyed every part of this tour and we had been onboard before.  Excellent guides to provide all the info that you want about the ship.
14,USS Midway,All the volunteers were happy to tell us all about the ship. We learned a lot of details about the planes and the functioning of the ship itself. Pretty interesting stuff!
15,Outstanding Experience,We truly enjoyed the 4 hours we spent on the Midway. The docents were amazing. You need to climb stairs and have plenty of time.
16,great tour great history,"We love visiting the Midway and have done it many times over the years.  While I appreciate all the work done and the employees/volunteers, this trip was rather disappointing.  Due to COVID, you have to buy your tickets online in advance and choose your entry time (this was not a problem, we did it from the parking lot and got right in).  They have plenty of signs regarding COVID, social distancing, etc (and hand sanitizer stations everywhere).  The disappointing part was that we weren't able to go down below inside the ship or up to the bridge.  It's understandable due to those being very confined areas, but had we known in advance we probably wouldn't skipped it this trip (it may already indicate such on their website, it's very possible I just missed it).  I still give it 4/5 stars because everyone should experience this great piece of history."
17,Good experience,This was an amazing site to see. The self guided tour was great and very informative. I also enjoyed seeing and talking with actual retired crew members who could give a level of insight on the day to day that otherwise couldn’t have been understood. This tour was amazing for families. There are a few tight spaces during the self guided tour so if you're not a fan be for-warned! The view on the deck was amazing as well!
18,boys day out,This was a great place to visit with family. Several interesting tours within the ship and also the guys enjoying talking about the activities on board. We stayed for 2-3 hours and ended our visit with the kids flying the simulators placed on the entrance deck. Can recommend a visit but it ain’t for free.
19,History,It's amazing to see how much of the ship they have opened to visitors.  I think we spent 4-5 hours there.  It really gives you perspective on the  day-to-day life on a carrier.  If you're a fan of military history & the Navy ( retired Navy chief here) then you will certainly enjoy this visit.  I was stationed in Yokosuka when the Midway was still home-ported there.  In the flight island tour they had a map that laid out where the ship docked along with outlines of the base as a whole.   More than a little nostalgia looking at the base & picturing the layout in my mind from some 30 years ago.
20,Patriotic!,We had a great time exploring this beauty. Very very cool experience!! Seems like they hire vets too that either worked on the ship or one like it. Very informative!
21,Outstanding and Highly Recommended,Luckily the crowds were low but it was a very moving experience and I highly recommend it. The island tower was awesom
22,Bucket List Done!,My husband & I so enjoyed our self guided tour of the USS Midway Museum. We loved exploring the inside and outside areas and getting the chance to see how the navy men lived on the ship. There were plenty of veterans around to answer questions and lots of informative posters on the walls with personal remarks from some of the previous men who had served aboard.
23,Wonderful History Lesson,"Was a very interesting tour, I like the fact that you could wonder all over the parts of the ship that were open, I was on an aircraft carrier in the late 70’s so it was also a nostalgically thing for me"
24,Well informed,"My experience at the midway was great. The ship was is great condition and well maintained. The docents were very helpful and wore the proper face protection. During COVID-19, parts of the ship were not open, the only open parts are the hangar and the flight deck. When it fully opens up, I would gladly go back to finish the tour."
25,Fantastic museum,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Midway. We had a group of 8 ranging from 3 to 82 and everyone liked the day we spent there. The kids loved the simulator rides and getting in the airplanes. They also did the scavenger hunt to get their ""wings"". The adults all liked the information shared. The retired volunteer veterans were great."
26,Brilliant resource,"A bit pricey but we felt this museum was so worth it. There is so much information that it is hard to read it all in the time we were there and we spent 4 hours there.  As a surprise plus, we were there when the Navy Frogjumpers (parachuters) performed in the air then landed on the top deck!  There are also docents throughout the ship who are very knowledgable.  This is a place worth seeing."
27,Very interesting visit,"We went on a Saturday and really loved the entire time we were there!  What a great experience to be able to walk around the ship.  The tour gives tremendous insight into how this massive machine operates and lets you see a lot of different places.  If you go, make sure you give yourself enough time so you don't have to rush...look around and try not to miss too much.  The below decks parts were extremely interesting, giving an opportunity to see how the 4,500 sailors lived day-to-day.  Make sure you do both parts, the one near the stairs up to the flight deck and the part in the front of the ship just to the right of the theater.  The flight deck itself is, obviously, massive and gives you a sense of how the aircraft were operated.  And, don't miss the Bridge tour.  It is a little hard to see as it starts around on the outside of the Island/Bridge and there was, for us, a bit of a line and short wait for the approximately 1/2 hour tour.  If you can do the steep stairs, that part is well worth the time.  In case you couldn't tell, we loved it and it was definitely worth the price of admission!"
28,COVID -19 ruin my visit,My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed this tour.  The volunteer who gave the tours were retired military men with a wealth of information and personal experience to share.
29,A Great Day and Experience,"So much history!  So much to learn!  We spent 5 hours there absorbing the information!  We totally loved the tour.  The “Yellow hats” are everywhere, and eager to tell you about the Midway.  Well worth the trip.  Free for active duty, $10 for military retirees."
30,Awesome ship! ,"Very interesting, and a lot to see. Veterans showing you around and the tour up to the bridge was really a plus."
31,Could have spent the whole day there,"We very much loved our visit to the USS Midway.  It has a stunning presence at port.  Our boys were aged 12 and 8 and they enjoyed both the flight deck and walking through the inside of the ship.  The communication and control rooms were fascinating.  The audio device is a must-use, especially on the flight deck.  It was so interesting learning about the history behind each aircraft.  Would absolutely recommend anyone visit this site."
32,Great walk through history,"Being a museum family and having previously visited the USS Yorktown, we were less than impressed with the Midway Museum. As the daughter of a veteran of the battle of Midway, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of recognition of the battle for which the carried was named.  But my disappointment didn’t stop there. After paying our hefty entrance fee, on-line, in advance, we arrived to find they had run out of headsets for the self-guided tour.  The alternate app they  offered didn’t work as a 50 year old aircraft carrier had no Wifi (go figure).  The visual interpretive materials were virtually non -existent.  Additionally, the flight deck was reminiscent of a road-side military museum, fully of an odd collection of aircraft most of which had no relationship or history related to any mission of this vessel.  If it’s your only chance to experience the ingenuity, powerful and magnitude of the US military, then go. But there are way more meaningful ways and less expensive ways to understand our military’s history of engineering innovation as well as the sacrifices of those who serve in it."
33,History Buff,My wife and I both enjoyed our visit to the Midway. The experience is greatly enhanced by the ex-service staff who give a fascinating personal insight to life on board this huge ship.
34,"Love the Midway, but be prepared during COVID",We had a great time touring the USS Midway! Its different from a typical museum in that you can tour the actual boat. The audio guides are really helpful and all the volunteers served at one time and so were very knowledgeable. The best part was the top of the ship where the planes were kept - one of the volunteers Paul gave a talk about how to land planes and it was incredible!
35,Outstanding,My wife and i were amazed at how much we enjoyed the tour and we didn't finish in 4-1/2 hours so have to go back. We just kept going to listen to various presentations that were fabulous.
36,A flash from the past,The tour was great and very informative. Lots of history and it was really fun. The tour guide was outstanding and made the whole tour a fantastic experience.
37,USS Midway Museum,We enjoyed out visit to the USS Midway. It is massive and you get to see a lot of cool areas. Don’t miss checking out the sick bay!
38,Truly astounding and magnificent! A history person's dream!,"Never been on an aircraft carrier before so thought I would take the tour. It didn’t disappoint and I just couldn’t believe the size!Costs $26 but honestly, you can be on there for hours. If you are in San Diego then you cannot miss this!"
39,Great interactive and interesting day,"We were able to attend the USS Midway for a evening event/party. It was awesome to see the planes and some of the quarters. Our event had food, drinks, dancing and a band. Touring around the ship was fun. The views from the ship of the San Diego skyline was beautiful. They had veterans on the ship to talk about the ship and the planes, as well as their service. The only thing I wish they had was more lighting on the deck of the ship to spotlight the planes and ship."
40,The Midway is my fav!,This was so educational and I was amazed at size of the ship inside and out.  Everyone should truly appreciate the volunteers.  Loved it
41,Amazing Museum!,We learned so much on this self guided tour. There were so many knowledgeable people along the way and tod us their own stories we absolutely loved it. So much to see and do while aboard it was interactive and historical. We would do this again my kids enjoyed it very much I think their favorite part was listening and learning from the the Vets who volunteer and tell as well as teach what they have experienced.
42,Sightseeing,We spend about 6 hours on the Midway . We took our time and listened to the men  and women who were explaining the history of the ship and sailors  We tour the entire ship where we were allow to go.  We both enjoyed every minute we were there.  This is a must see while visiting San Diego
43,A must thing to do..........................,We spent 5 hours on a Saturday morning touring this awesome aircraft carrier. This is a must see attraction for naval aviation enthusiasts. My wife and I enjoyed the tour of this ship. The staff and volunteers that work and provide guidance were top notch.
44,Way over priced,"My wife, nephew and I spent a great afternoon touring the USS Midway. What a fascinating place! The technology and courage of our military strength makes me so proud to be an American! Everyone should visit the Midway to understand the sacrifices made by our men and women in the military. Thank you all for your service!"
45,This was our first time visit and we were thrilled with our experience on the USS Midway Museum.,We had a great day exploring the USS Midway with family. There was ten of us all together with our great great grandson became a Marine the day before. Because he became a Marine we all got in free. Get the free tour device and you can listen to different fact along the way. Tells you facts about different airplanes and helicopters and the ship itself. Some of took the tour to the top of ship. Seen the ship wheel and the Captain bunk. Great day. Glad we toured the Midway.
46,A Superbly Impressive Venue to Visit...,We loved our tour of the USS Midway!  All of the docents were excellent in sharing their personal experiences to bring this ship to life.  And the personal audio handsets were fantastic in providing extremely interesting details about so many areas of the ship as well as of the various aircraft on both the flight and hangar decks.
47,Visiting a Ship that a old friend served on in the 70's,"Lots of walking, but I enjoyed it!  We arrived at opening time and got in quickly.  The audio tour worked well and was interesting.  If you can handle the steps, I recommend the ""Island Tour"" which is a guided tour through 3 of the command centers."
48,Great military and flight museum,"Absolutely awesome museum.  I highly recommend. We spent the entire day here. So much history but presented in a fascinating way. My 14 year old son, husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
49,Dinner event,"We loved the visit to USS Midway, this huge structure and learned a lot of facts and info about WWII and the ops on this aircraft carrier. Magnificent history and great veterans also.Thanks to our heros, for keeping us safe."
50,Family visit.,Highly recommend this tour. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the entire ship. The veterans were so informative and helpful. Thanks for a great tour
51,Shipboard living in tight spaces.,So amazing! The docent talks about landing and taking off were fascinating. We got there at 10am and left at 2 and hadn't seen everything. A must see!
52,must see,Visiting the USS Midway is a great tour of our history. It really makes you proud to be an American. We were very impressed by all the people that helped us see this great ship. Thank you all for your service!
53,Very cool and educational,"We visited the ship in early March. The suggested time there is 3 hours, but we spent much longer there and actually got a free return ticket for the next day so we could go up top in the control center. We started with the short, 15-minute film about the ship which was a great introduction. This ship was the one that served the longest in U.S. history. All the volunteers are wonderful and extremely knowledgeable--they can answer anything. They provide handheld remotes so you can go up to a particular aircraft or exhibit and hear about it. I really like these types of self-guided tours; you go at your own pace, can hear everything, and if one area is crowded you can just skip it and move on. All the planes and helicopters on the main deck were really cool. I'd highly suggest listening to the presentation on that deck about how they landed and took off from the flight deck. We also went inside and saw all the quarters, kitchen & dining area, chaplain rooms, post office, etc. It is amazing how many people were in those tiny spaces. There are many narrow staircases that go up and down, so if you have mobility issues, you may not want to go inside. This is one of those things my husband really wanted to see, but I think I enjoyed it almost as much as him. This is a must see if you are in San Diego!"
54,A Must see!,Museum was one of the best.  We had the chance to chat with some of the volunteers who had served on the USS Midway. Very impressive
55,A fantastic experience. ,"We have visited the USS Midway Museum twice and loved it both times.  If you visit in February, you might get to take advantage of the 1/2 price museum visit promotion.  Check a local library for a coupon.  Then if you keep your ticket stub, you will get $5.00 off a harbor cruise.  Park in the lot next to the Midway for $10.  After we spent 4 hours on the ship, we walked next door to The Fish Market restaurant and had a wonderful lunch!"
56,Informative and absorbing,"I’m not especially interested in planes and helicopters nor giant ships but thought a quick walk through would be good. Five hours later we hadn’t seen much of the lower decks and decided we’d just have to come back another time!  Listening to retired pilots talk in detail about how planes are launched every 45 seconds was crazy cool. Another retired serviceman talked about how the ship was handled up top and what each crewman did to propel the ship. Who actually steered the ship and how tedious that simple job actually was is a quick conversation but very interesting. Heading back down to the Flight Deck to hear a whole different set of pilots educate the crowd on how they land places every 90 seconds (I think it was 90 seconds). Loved it! The Leap Frog Team dropped in on deck and that in itself was fun to watch!  2.5 hours in and we haven’t looked at one plane.... The hearing devices they give you are helpful. Each airplane or helicopter has a “chip” the listening device can activate if you want. Then 30 second monologue tells the significance of that particular aircraft. Again, very interesting!  Go check it out but give yourself a bit of flex time incase it takes longer than you think."
57,Sights and experiences,We visited the museum with older teenagers. It is a self-guided tour except for the bridge when a tour guide will take you for a short tour. The ship is bigger than you would think...so many passageways and doors. It was interesting for us how Navy men and women live at sea due to our daughter joining the Navy soon. Expect to spend a few hours on board if you want to see everything. I would start at the bottom deck and work my way up to the top deck. The top deck has many aircraft to see and also some volunteers that give video lessons on aircraft taking off/landing on aircraft carriers. Very interesting. For people who do not climb stairs this would be a difficult tour.
58,Knowledgeable Staff and Great Museum,I’ve been making my way around to see this amazing ships. The Midway has great tours. Make sure you check their availability.
59,Fascinating Ship & History,A conference dinner event was held on the deck of the USS Midway.  The venue was wonderful and so was the tour.
60,Spring break with mom,got there early and was so much to see it really takes 2 trips to cover everything . there are tours with actually servicemen that work on the midway when it was active
61,Great Warship Museum,Had a great time seeing and learning from the gentlemen who served on the ship and now are guides that will answer any question you have.
62,A Very Interesting Piece of History,"Worth to pay a visit Very nicely presented; this is an impressive piece of history...You can see few shoppers, firefighters and you can even go onboard!Staff is friendly"
63,The best thing we did in San Diego,Everyone enjoyed the trip and look into historical planes both teen and children enjoyed it as well as the adults
64,Outstanding Museum,Spent the day on the Midway with my 12 and 14 year old boys. We had a great time. They enjoyed going in the planes and helicopters. Great tour overall!
65,An afternoon well spent exploring the USS Midway!,"This is a must see! Even though most of the ship was off limits due to Covid, we still thoroughly enjoyed our visit (& felt very safe and welcome)! The best part for me was listening to the docents talk (explaining how things on the ship work and telling us about their experiences). Its my personal opinion that all Americans should visit a military museum or experience of some kind to put things in perspective. We so often take our freedoms for granted. Being on the flight deck was simply amazing! We actually went back to our hotel that evening and watched the Midway movie! My son now want to do a report about Midway. Thank you Midway Museum for the great day!"
66,The best of the carrier museums.,We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the USS Midway - the best $26 we spent in San Diego. Informative and fun - self guided so you can take as long as you like. Recommended!
67,USS Midway,"This is the 3rd carrier museum I have visited and by far the best. This ship has more open areas to tour and more to see and do on the hanger deck. As a USS Forrestal Navy vet, this was the closest I will get to a super carrier. Hornet and Lexington are much smaller and do not have as big of a collection of airplanes and helicopters. Would recommend to all."
68,Amazing Aircraft Carrier Museum!,The museum is a great place to visit. The scale of the ship is amazing. You can experience so much in a short period of time. I really enjoyed all aspects of the tour.
69,Great museum even for the non-military buff,"My husband and I were so happy that we purchased tickets in advance and got to the Midway just before it opened. We went straight up to the flight deck, where a very helpful docent urged us to take the tour of the “island” before it got too crowded. We are so glad that we did, as we only waited a few minutes for our tour to begin. I was so impressed that everywhere we went on the Midway, there were so many helpful and knowledgeable docents. They were also very enthusiastic, and eager to share with us. This is definitely the top thing to do when in San Diego!"
70,Fascinating and fun!,"My husband and I spent a few days in San Diego and thought when will we ever get a chance to go on an aircraft carrier again, so we decided to visit.My husband is in a wheelchair and the Midway is not completely wheelchair accessible. They say about 70% accessible although I would argue that it is not quite that high.Admission was $26 per person although my husband had his fee waived.The upper deck was the most interesting part to me. Lots of aircraft on display, views of the city and bay, video presentations you could watch and the volunteers walking around were very knowledgeable - many of them had flown jets/planes and landed on aircraft carriers. Very interesting talking to them.There are simulators on the lower deck but they charge extra for those!!Worth a visit for anyone interested in the Navy or history."
71,Fascinating and fun!,"Great place to visit, we learned a lot from the self guided tour! Kids even enjoyed themselves! Lots to do and see! Well worth it!"
72,Proud to be an American!,My second visit and I continue to be amazed. The retired fellows who answered questions are great!I am impressed with the way they keep the facility in top condition!!Well worth the stop!!
73,im very patriotic - so this is a must,"This is a must see, no doubt about it! Impressive and historic. I spend over 2 hours walking around. Also great viws on the skyline and the bay area!"
74,Fantastic experience and value,"What a great tour and all the volunteers who are made up of many military service personnel make it so very interesting and sometimes emotional.  We toured from the Bridge to the Admiral and Captains quarters, to the seaman mess halls, to the engine rooms and many parts of the everyday parts of the Carrier.  The flight deck and all the many planes on board were amazing to see.  We will do this tour again next time we return to San Diego as there are many military vets hosting lectures."
75,A must see in San Diego,"This was the 2nd time that my husband and I visited the USS Midway Museum and it didn't really change that much.  It did seem that there were a couple of new areas to see, but can't be sure.  I don't think we got to see everything since we got there mid morning and they close at 5:00pm.  Definitely would recommend if you haven't seen it before, but plan on walking a lot."
76,Interesting historical tour,"I had some time and I had visited the ship before, back in 1972 while it was still a serving Navy SHip, to see a friend styationed there.  The Midway battle was a moving experience, parts of which were filmed on the ship.  The aircraft were very interesting to me. As a veteran, it was great to see all the sircraft and the ship."
77,Everyone should visit,Excellent visit. This ship was built by women and missed the war by 8 days. The ship is absolutely massive and a must visit. Excellent narration by personnel and easy to find
78,Midway Museum,Touring the Midway was a bucket list activity for my husband and neither of us were disappointed. It was an excellent self guided tour but you learn so much more from chatting with the the volunteer docents who seem to be all ex service. We learned so much about this amazing ship! Plan for at least 2.5 to 3 hours.
79,Definitely something that you should be on everyone's sightseeing list,I've visited the Midway two times over the past 4 years.  I have to say that they have really improved the experience by having former fighter pilots giving talks on the upper decks.  These guys have great (and harrowing ) stories to tell.  You could spend 4 hours here and not see everything.
80,Impressive ship,Excellent museum. I am ex-Navy so I always enjoy being able to see and experience naval history first hand. The volunteers are excellent and very knowledgeable. The views of San Diego Harbor are great from the flight deck and even got to see a current aircraft carrier arriving in port while visiting. Great place to spend a few hours while in San Diego. Highly recommended.
81,Great excursion ,We are here in San Diego for a few days away during the pandemic. We chose to do the tour of the USS Midway and I am so glad we did. There were not many people so that made it seem like a weekday with no lines and it was pleasant. Only the hanger deck and flight deck were open but that still took us over 2 hours to see. I was shocked at the shear size of this thing. It is 1001 feet long and when you walk it from end to end you are beyond amazed. The stories you will hear from the docents and from the audio tour are emotional. I learned nearly everything I know about Midway Island on this tour. There are allot of stairs to climb and a ton of walking. Overall I give this an A++.
82,A must see.,As my husband is a retired marine we take great pride in visiting our military treasurers. The midway museum is one of these. Excellent history for the entire family.
83,An Icon of Naval History,"An afternoon in San Diego, having walked for miles exploring the city and having had a bus tour, we decided we couldn’t leave without checking out the Midway museum. The tour is all encompassing, starting on the cavernous main hangar deck indoors flowing up to the flight deck with its selection of parked warplanes (each with its own story) and then moving to a tour of the bridge and quarters. Staffed by ex-sailors and officers each of whom are pleased to explain the various areas of the ship or the planes, makes for a more realistic experience. The view from the flight deck as the sun slowly sank over the horizon is special and the lights of the city twinkle as you marvel at the size of this magnificent vessel. An afternoon well spent indeed!"
84,Vacation visit,"People told us we could do the tour in an hour. That would have felt very rushed. We ended up spending over four hours on the Midway. We watched the LeapFrogs (Seals and other special forces) who parachute from a plane. They trailed some smoke and simulated a mid drop rescue. They all landed right on target at the front of the flight deck. That took about 30 minutes and was well worth it. There are two live presentations on the flight deck, with information about landing and taking off. We then took the guided tour of flight operations and the bridge (another 20 minutes or so). Finally, we watched ""Voices of Midway"" with some footage and interviews from Midway Battle participants, including George Gay, the only survivor of Torpedo Squadron 8 from USS Hornet. Made me very proud to be an American."
85,An awesome museum and tour!,"Was part of our ""attractions"" package and it was brilliant.Vary interesting listening to the audio and also the stories told by veterans who in themselves were all very interesting, enthusiastic and knowledgable. Excellent experience to be on such a massive ship"
86,Wonderful piece of history,"I’ve been here twice in the last few years and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The ship is professionally presented and staffed by highly enthusiastic and knowledgable people.  If you can, plan on a whole day.  The ship is huge and packed with things to see. Highly recommended."
87,"A must see for all, especially history fans",Last day of my stay in San Diego so I wondered down to the Midway Museum and was pleasantly surprised at all there was to learn and see. Price was great and the volunteers were helpful and friendly.
88,Great tour,"As soon as we boarded the Midway we had 3 gentlemen working available to answer our questions.  They weren't running the film that day and these men gave us all kinds of information!  There are really neat airplanes to see as well as a super tour of the entire ship.  Our kids did a virtual ride for $7 each that they really enjoyed as well.  There isn't a restaurant area but they have snacks and drinks.  That being said, for a kid lunch sized bag of Cheetohs be prepared to pay $3.  We opted to starve and eat elsewhere.  The gift shop is neat but is also on the expensive side ($40 for a Tee shirt).  We purchased our tickets on Trip Advisor with the exception of 1 military ticket that was cheaper to buy at the ticket office."
89,Don't miss it!,When in San Diego we did a tour of the USS Midway. It was overwhelming to see the size of the aircraft carrier.It is well worth doing if you are ever in San Diego.  Where the planes are stored below deck is amazing.
90,Outstanding,My husband and I loved our visit at the USS Midway Museum. Gave me additional appreciation for what young men and women do for the US. Thank you!!  The docent volunteers were amazing and I really enjoyed the audio tour!!
91,Great tour even though I was in a wheelchair ,"Definitely worth a few hours to tour this magnificent ship!  Imagine the life back in the day.  Top deck amazing with all the planes that possibly flew off this deck.  The inside of the ship....it's an entire city!  Hospital, dental, lots of kitchens and eating halls, entertainment, and so much more!  Oh, and they even had a JAIL!  Yep!  (Behave sailors!)  There were also lots of volunteers that actually flew these jets off the decks of ships!  Talk about some good commentary!  GO!"
92,"intersting enough, if one is interested in military history","This museum is interactive for all.  The people who work there many are veterans and love to share their stories with you.  I loved that people can actually sit in the seats of many aircraft, and experience life on the ship. They offer headsets to explain each plane and it's history"
93,So interesting!,"While there were only two decks available for exploring, there is still plenty to check out on the ship. Take the time to sit down and learn form the men who ran this ship in its hay day. They are a wealth of knowledge and humor. We happened to go on the Midway's 75th birthday, so we were offered a commemorative medallion. It is stunning, just a small token of such an amazing ship. Bottom line, it may not be fully accessible, but it is definitely worth the trip to honor these men and women for their years of service and dedication."
94,Unexpectedly Cool,We spent four hours at the Midway and it was worth every minute. We love history and there was a ton of it here. Take a trip up to the bridge on “the island.” An amazing look at how things actually happened! And don’t miss the film.
95,Great museum,"We toured this GREAT SHIP a few years ago.  Suggest you arrive at opening, view the Command Center first (as lines grow long in the afternoon); we were the first people onto the SHIP and the last ones to leave at closing.   This is a superior exhibit.  Most interesting were all the stories from the Pilots that actually flew the planes.   We recently referred a young married couple and they simply loved it."
96,Very Interesting,This museum really takes you back to the past. The exhibits and notes are very informative. It was the best attraction in town. They suggest you block about 3 hours to see a reasonable amount. The views from various rooms are also worth it
97,Can keep you engaged the whole day,the kids loved it and the rides food and information they received. The crew was helpful and very friendly
98,Very informative,"I only discovered this place while reading about things to do in San Diego.  I made my wife come and she had a great time.  This is the actual decommishioned aircraft carries loaded with planes, VR events, and several docents who served on board.  The entire ship is open for exploration including several guided tours.  I was only expecting to spend a few hours but spent most of the day. You need at least a full day to see everything.  It is very well done and the docents are such fonts of knowledge.  There is something there for anyone of any age.  Definitely put it on your list."
99,Return Visit -,I spent a couple of hours here and it was very interesting. I was on my own and could get around easily and fast. The ship is well maintained and getting inside was fascinating. The volunteers are great too - you can ask as many questions as you like. No vegan food options though...
100,USS Midway,Do take time to visit the USS Midway Museum.  It is very interesting and worth the visit.  It's a great way to see how a military ship operates and what our men and women do to protect our nation.  The history of Midway is fascinating.
101,Awesome visit.  The Museum is so interesting; not just the flight deck but also the technical information.,"Spent far longer at this attraction than we anticipated, it was that interesting. One can't fail to be impressed by the scale of this floating city, staffed by friendly, accommodating volunteers happy to share their knowledge.The tour focusses on all aspects of the ships operations, not just the glory and danger of the flying operations. Get there early, it does get busy. There's a lot of walking and stairs so make sure you take water and comfortable footwear. Take your time and just enjoy this piece of floating history."
102,Amazing Visit to a Childhood Memory,"This place has so much to see and learn. The docents are so knowledgeable. I got to meet Paul, who has an immense amount of knowledge and expertise. Don't miss sitting in on his lecture about landing fighter jets on an aircraft carrier."
103,Great outing at military icon,"What an incredible museum and tribute to those who serve. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The collection of aircraft is impressive. The tour through the decks that detail life onboard is very thorough. And the free self guided devices explain everything you’re seeing very well. If you plan on seeing it all, set aside at least three hours.  More if it’s busy. The island tour is not self guided and requires some ladder climbing so it can take a while to get through a tour. This is a must see in San Diego."
104,Historical Monument,Fantastic museum. I’m normally in and out of museums in no time but I spent over 3 hours here and I even skipped many audio stops. I enjoyed every part of the tour.
105,Great place to take the family and learn a little history (in a fun way),Great way to spend 3-5 hours. The deck attractions (landing & trapping) were great... especially the landing presentation as it’s done by a former Naval aviator.
106,Learned a lot,"I was astounded at the size of this museum. I expected it to be rather limited and a quick stop, but after 2 hours we had not even come close! I need to return again to finish."
107,Amazing collection of aircraft.  Great docents on board to explain stuff!,"We spent about 3 hours on the ship. With your admission you receive a electronic tour guide on a lanyard. Took the advice of other reviewers and brought our wired headsets so you didn't have to hold the device up to your ear. Throughout the ship you scan the sign with your device and you learn about that part of the ship, plane or helicopter. They have two scanning points, one for adults and one for children. We found listening to both was quite informational.  The living areas were informational on how they lived and worked. You could see sleeping bunks, the control room and sit at the controls for pictures. On the top deck they had volunteer veterans with an area set up with chairs and screen. They would show clips of the planes they flew and provide stories and information about the missions they flew. They were engaging and it was an honor to listen to them."
108,A must-see while in San Diego!,"Learn the great history behind this incredible ship. The docents were knowledgeable and very friendly. Great collection of planed, jets and helicopters. Amazing how big this ship really is when you walk all the levels. Definitely recommend."
109,OVERWHELMING IN SIZE AND HISTORY,"We went to the Midway museum mid week and avoided the crowds.  It was great, volunteers everywhere with first hand experience on aircraft carriers.  One price covers it all, hand sanitizers were everywhere!  We learned so much and covered most of it in 3 hours but you could certainly spend more time there.  Highly recommend if you are n San Diego."
110,Incredible!!,It's a fun day adventure and lots to see once your down there.  The Park is fun there are a some good thrill rides for the younger ones.  Good food and it's a good atmosphere for people. A safe place to visit and enjoy the exhibits and things.
111,Definitely a must-see while in San Diego,"It took me over 10 years to get around to going, was closed because of covid19 when last there, but had just reopened a few days before we visited, so when we went it was pretty quiet, even with limited capacity. They are still doing talks, my 8 year old son was actually interested in the informative volunteer talking about the engine room.They have a small selection of of food and drinks, and vending machines on flight deck.Definitely a recommended visit,  we did it right after bay cruise as its right next to dock."
112,Amazing collection of naval aircraft on a historic vessel,WOW! what great folks who take it as such an honor to make this tour for citizens.  So many thing to see even though some were not open due to Covid.  But overall so worth to see this piece of history!
113,Awesome experience,Very informative worthwhile display. It was well done and plenty of people to answer any questions. Thank you to all veterans!
114,Awesome experience on an Aircraft Carrier.,"Lots to see, although only a fraction of the ship is open to the public.  I think they have a example of almost every aircraft that flew off her deck.Many of the docents are retired navy and they have scheduled talks about launch, landing, the bridge, etc.Below decks will let you see officers' country, the wardrooms, crew mess, berthing spaces and engine room.There is a snack bar now with a bigger restaurant in the planning stage.Enjoyed the theater especially.Frequently used by the navy for retirement, promotion, etc. ceremonies.Lots of stairs, main and hanger decks are wheelchair accessible but not much else."
115,Fantastic museum ,What a day to remember. We crawled over this massive beast from engine room to bridge. We mostly went on our own way but took a guided tour up the bridge area later. It is not possible to describe what you see over the 16 of the 18 decks it has. It is not possible to imagine that this boat had 4500 crew and had 3.4 million gallons of fuel...there are more statistics that re imposing....History buff or not...GO . I started to finish this review with was the tour more than 1 day. It can be both.depending on your enthusiasm
116,Not to be missed when visiting San Diego,"If you are a Military Buff, you will love this museum.  There are so many levels to view and   Equipment you can get on and play.  Small but good coffee shop.  Enjoy the Carrier planes on exhibit. The absolute top floor lends spectacular views of San Diego, Coronado Island , the San Diego Bridge and on a clear day, you can also see Mexico in the far distance.  The Midway s next door to City cruises."
117,Plobano Mole Cooking Class at Chocolate Museum,"Our self-guided tour of the USS Midway was fascinating. Learned a lot about life aboard ship and the crew's responsibilities. Landing on a moving ship, especially at night, was quite a challenge.  If you're in San Diego, I highly recommend this tour."
118,An Amazing Piece of History!,Well presented displays with various veterans sharing experiences with you. A shame that some things are off limit
119,Fascinating tour through history,Brilliant attraction easy to get around plenty of exhibits some interactive.  Allow plenty of time as there is so much to see.
120,A must to include on any San Diego visit,We enjoyed this.  It can take up to Four hours if you see everything.  We used our city pass.  Great piece of history.  Guides very knowledgeable.  Planes you can sit in.
121,Great history lessons,"What a Fun Tour!As an aviation buff and plane nut, this museum was both informative and enjoyable. For a measly twenty something dollars, one can spend hours on board to explore different aspects of life at sea in an aircraft carrier. The exhibits were meticulously organized and maintained. The descriptions and audio information were detailed. The best part of the tour was the veterans.  At key locations throughout the boat veterans were there to provide colourful anecdotes and delightful conversations.  I spoke at length with someone who spent 20 years working in the turbine room. The flight deck was breathtaking. I spent a good 20 minutes chatting with a retired USMC pilot who made his first carrier landing on Midway over 40 years ago. He was a fount of knowledge. I was an aviation geek and knew a lot about the aircraft onboard. Yet, in one conversation I picked up so much more about the A6 Intruder.Highly recommended!"
122,Oasis of Culture,"The volunteer presenters were excellent.  They were passionate, they had actually been piliots and had served on the uss midway when it had been in service.  I would highly recommend anyone to visit the uss midway museum."
123,Awesome!,"We made the mistake of going on a weekend, and were told by a volunteer that, on that day, there were two to three times more people than on a typical weekday! So lines were long, and there were people literally everywhere!Other than that, the museum itself is exemplary. Great exhibits, and really knowledgeable and friendly volunteers, whom I expect are all ex-military. A great experience, found nowhere else on the west coast. Highly recommended."
124,Uss midway,"The USS Midway was one of the major reasons why we picked San Diego as our travel destination, and our visit there exceeded our expectations. It was absolutely amazing to listen to the docents talk about taking off and landing on the aircraft carrier. The docents we talked with were all veterans and some had actually served on her. Looking through the below decks, the kitchens, dining areas, barber shops, laundry facilities,  captain's quarters, etc. - all was so interesting. We stayed for hours and only left because we were tired, there was definitely more to see. If/when we go back to San Diego, we'll go see it again!"
125,Great Museum,"This is a must do for anyone who cares about freedom/liberty. Only the hangar and flight decks were open during our visit, but that was enough. The stories told by those who served on this carrier are moving. The ship is almost 100% staffed by those who did service on her. Kudos to the them! Highly recommend!"
126,A fascinating visit,"Very interesting and fun for an old former Marine and Navy brat, but my wife enjoyed it as well! We got a lot of exercise as well climbing up and down in the interior of the ship."
127,Thank you to the volunteers ,"This was by far one of the best museums I have ever visited, The volunteers (Docents) that are at various locations on the ship brought this museum to life, I spent over 4 1/2 hours on board, and if it wasn't for jet lag would have spent a lot more."
128,Breathtaking. Amazing. HUGE,"We had a great visit.  The 'yellow-hats' who serve as docents are so sweet and knowledgeable given that they served on the ship and it's just fun hearing their experiences.   The free audio tour is also nicely done.  You tap the device to the specially marked kiosks and a narrative relating to the area is played.  I thought the content and length of each section was perfect.  It was less history lesson and more 'fun facts' which is what you want when you are  trying to take-in a lot of information.We were delayed because of traffic and only had about 2 hours for our visit.  If you want to be able to see everything, probably 3 hours is a more optimal time frame."
129,Lots of history ,My husband had a solo day in San Diego And headed straight for the USS Midway. He thoroughly enjoyed touring the ship and riding the flight simulator.
130,Best thing to do in San Diego,This is a must when visiting SD.  There are lots of interesting planes and other exhibits.  The whole experience is outstanding
131,Interesting and vast,This is a great place to visit and see the history of a very important part of our military. This museum visit is highly recommended
132,"Great museum, the real thing",We enjoyed a sunny Saturday afternoon on the US Midway. There are aircraft inside and on the flight deck to enter and see just how detailed the cockpits are. The docents are there to explain how the aircraft take off and land and they are so interesting to listen to. It's as if they were on a mission just yesterday.We had a beautiful day so we toured the flight deck first and ended the tour with the below deck section of the ship. It's amazing how a crew of 4500 cohabitated together in such tight quarters. Such is the life of an enlisted service person!Make sure you grab the (free) audio device - I witnessed a family just walking around looking at the exhibits but without hearing the voices of those that were actually there you're missing the best part of the tour.  We spend about 4 hours there. Could have spent 5 so plan accordingly.
133,Must see,"This is a must see attraction, an American masterpiece!  The entire tour was outstanding from top to bottom.  Elevators are available to assist wheel chairs and options for people who have difficulty with stairs.  Some areas are very tight for space, expected for a ship.  Several personnel available to answer any questions and provide insight on the ship's history.  Some of the personnel served on the ship at points of time.  Presentations on the flight deck on how aircraft take-off and land. Food and beverages are available with reasonable prices, supports the organization.  Plenty of parking in front of museum and surroung areas.  Arrive early if you want parking in front of ship.  Will definately see again when in San Diego."
134,It’s a must do,"This is a fantastic museum!  Allow at least 4-5 hours to fully experience this aircraft carrier.  You could actually spend all day there.  So much to see.  The Docents are retired military who are helpful, kind, and full of information and stories if you take the time to ask.  It really gives you a feel of how life was onboard this carrier.  Lots of aircraft are on display.  And great presentations by retired pilots that were stationed on the Midway.  A self guided audio is available.  An absolute must see."
135,Must see!,"Visited a 2nd time in a couple of years.  As a former carrier sailor,  it was great to be around familiar sights and sounds. Recommend the below-deck docents who can explain their jobs and how things work."
136,Well worth the time to visit!,"We went to the museum Feb. 17, 2020.  Had a 6 and 10 year old with us and all had a great time!  They have a self guided audio tour so you can see things at your own pace which is nice.  There are certain points that have separate audio for kids and adults.  Very interesting.  It was pretty busy on the day we were there.  Not sure if that's because it was Presidents Day or maybe it is always busy, but the place is HUGE so once you get out of the hangar bay the crowd is thinned out and never had to wait anywhere. The only line was for the tour of the command island on the flight deck.   I would recommend getting there close to when they open and go straight to the flight deck and tour the command island as the line can get long in the afternoon.  We made the mistake of going here on our last day in San Diego and had to catch a plane home later in the afternoon so we didn't leave enough time to tour the island.  That was our fault.  All in all it was awesome and our kids loved it!  We will be back next time we are in San Diego!"
137,A Boys Dream,"I was here for an evening event, and was perusing the displays before the event.  The information was interesting enough, but since I'm not a military aficionado, I wasn't particularly interested in the infomration."
138,Wonderful museum,"We look this tour while vacationing in San Diego. We got there too late in the day to take advantage of the guided tour, but it was still nice to walk around the ship. I didn't think that the collection of aircraft on tge flight deck was nearly as good as the USS Intrepid in New York city."
139,Very interesting visit ,Visiting the USS Midway is a definite ‘must-do’ activity when in San Diego. The tour itself is great and a real learning experience. The sheer size and detail are amazing. Be sure to take the time to listen to the dosents share their experiences and stories. This adds a tremendous value and depth to your experience when visiting!
140,Wonderful museum,My family toured the ship as part of an 80th birthday party.  Athena Acosta helped with all of the details prior to our arrival.  David Harper was our Docent for the tour.  My family and I had a great time and highly recommend the tour for everyone.  Thank you Athena and David for making this a memorable event.
141,Cant miss tour in San Diego,"For a birthday gift I took my husband to San Diego; part of the trip was a visit to the USS Midway. My husband reallty liked it, to my surprise I liked it as well.  As a tip I advised to purchase tickets ahead of time."
142,A Piece of History,We visited with a toddler and everyone had fun. The adults enjoyed the history and education and the toddler loved seeing all the planes and pushing the MANY buttons in several of the rooms. Much of the museum is not stroller accessible so plan on the kiddos walking or being carried for most of it. The snack bar is pretty basic but it is possible to make a meal of it if needed. The deck right outside has a lovely view making it a great place for a break before continuing through more of the ship.
143,Must see museum,"If you haven't been to the USS Midway you need to go and take the family, this is a great place for families to see just a little bit of what it's like for the US Navy while deployed at sea. I served with HS-4 in Coronado back in the 80's so for families this was great. There are lot's of fighter jets, helicopters, video demonstrations to learn from and you can walk through a lot of the ship to see everything from berthing to control tower, to flight deck etc.etc. ."
144,Patriotic visit,This museum is large - and it only occupies a small proportion of the ship! It is very interesting and lots to see and read. The cafe here is totally disappointing with a complete lack of any decent quality or variety of food. I really wish we'd taken the short walk to Seaport to find a cafe. The museum itself though is well worth a visit - just take a picnic or eat before/after your visit.
145,So good we returned the next day!,Don't miss this.  The ship was very interesting.  The yellow hats were very helpful and informative.  Make sure you go before the vets are too old to tell their stories.  It's a must see!
146,Impressive,"This is a real aircraft carrier that you can explore all over, down deep where the services, eating, resting, meeting, laundry and sleeping are, up front where controls are, on top with the airplanes. There is a collection of ""every"" plan that used the Midway over about 40 years.  the docents are retired navy who have served on various ships and can give you real insights if you ask questions. I spent an entire afternoon and then went back the next day for more. It is terrific, just ignore the kitsch every now and then."
147,Interesting!,"You will not be disappointed, be sure to listen to the landing lecture on the flight deck, done by actual pilots. Parking is awful, most are metered at 3 hours, not enough time..."
148,Great Museum,"If you like military history, planes, ships, top gun and guns, this is a great museum to visit. Get a feel for everyday life aboard a aircraft carrier, this is a must."
149,"4,5 hours  visit really enjoyed it",I went with a big group from my Air Force squadron (including families); the docents were very knowledgeable and friendly with tips for the kids in our group. It was really neat to see a glimpse of Navy life and history.
150,Excellent ,"Went on a sunday arrived early before 10.00 am , Guide tour on the bridge amazing , all experienced  volunteers .  Landing and take off presentation by pilots who flew  the midway amazing , their stories .   Many aircraft on display."
151,USS Midway Museum is a must visit!,This was a great experience and a good view into life on an aircraft carrier and military history and equipment/vehicles. I come from an aircraft family so it was great to be able to stand this close to things like an F-14 on the flight deck. We were also lucky to catch the end of some sort of ceremony on the deck. Definitely worth the trip but expect a crowd and some steps.
152,Wonderful Outing,"Recently visited the USS Midway Museum over President's Day weekend. It seemed really busy around 11ish, but we still managed to grab a parking spot. Our parking fee was $10 and opted to park close. During the month of February, you can score a FREE San Diego museum pass at local library or if a guest of Hilton. This pass will save you a lot of money on entrance fees at select museums in San Diego and it really helped us reduce admission fees for two adults and two teens. If anything, have your student bring along their school ID. We spent about 3 hours here. It was AMAZING! You will feel such pride as you listen to the stories of the pilots and sit in the cockpits of the many different planes. Our kids loved it and we had a really memorable time. Thought the photo packages were a bit pricey. Would be willing to purchase if (1) photo was offered at say $10, but it was around $30 for the photo package. We passed and just took our own pics. It really is a must see on your sightseeing list. If you have the chance, definitely go!"
153,A must!,We learned so much in this museum. It definitely holds a lot of history! Btw Jessica at the photo booth was the sweetest girl ever!
154,"Impressive, well done and very interesting",It was great.  Learned a lot regarding the service of the USS Midway.  It was cool to see all the different types of planes.  Went into the bellows of the ship first then on the deck.  Really good experience.
155,A day out,"This is a must see if you visit San Diego. Very Informative, educational and also it's good to experience and get a little insight into how our Navy men work and travel. It is a fun experience specially for the young and the old who love planes. You can also visit the grounds around there. The famous  Kissing Statue called the "" Unconditional Surrender"" is right next to USS MidWay Museum. You can walk around Sea Port Village too."
156,Great Tour!!,"This is a must see when visiting SAN.  If you are a veteran or just like history, this is a great stop.  They do a great job with the small groups that are led by past crew members of the Midway.  It does get crowded, so get there early so you can enjoy the sights without feeling overcrowded.  We found a great discount on Groupon, which helps you get head of the line entrance.  Very enjoyable."
157,Tour,"The USS Midway was an awesome experience! This museum can give the average person the chance to be aboard an actual U.S. warship. Where else can you say you have been onboard an aircraft carrier? The ship is well kept and the staff of volunteers, veterans with experience, provide great expertise and stories of their service. With the added Midway Theatre, adds even more insight about the aircraft used and the Battle of Midway itself. I highly recommended anyone visiting San Diego, to stop by and tour this piece of great history."
158,Interesting and fun museum,"My father and uncles fought in WW II so I found the museum personally important but it's relevant to all generations. Informative and interesting exhibits and excellent docents to help interpret them, most of whom are vets themselves. Must see for military fans."
159,Interesting-great museum,"As a history enthusiast, this is a must do trip while in San Diego!There are multiple decks, where you can explore multiple things, like the hangar, the engineering rooms, the crew sleeping quarters, the ready rooms for the pilots, the control rooms, and my personal favourite of course the flight deck! Reminds me alot of Top Gun!During my visit there were a collection of amazing air crafts on the flight deck it self and some kind of a graduation ceremony happening there. So it was certainly memorable.This visit makes this american trip complete for me, there is nothing that screams more american than an aircraft carrier!Make sure you take a bottle of water cause you might get thirsty, it might be take you longer than expected to explore this place, it is certainly bigger than I expected. The gift shop towards the end is a nice place to buy a few kitsch souvenir."
160,Really interesting,"This museum was awesome! Make sure you eat lunch before you go bc you will be there a while! Jerry, one of the volunteers teaching about the planes and how the take off and land on the deck was so great! I could have listened to him all day! He sure knew his stuff! I didn’t think I would like this or be that interested but it was such a great learning experience! Highly recommend checking this museum out!"
161,Amazing tour and very fun simulators,I highly recommend for anyone interested in US military history! Allow several hours for a thorough walk-through or take the audio tour!
162,Absolutely Outstanding!,Every American should visit to gain an appreciation of what our navy and marines sacrifice for us.  Unbelievable opportunity to see the power of these ships.
163,The Movie Midway Comes To Life,"A must see when in the San Diego area. The pure size of this ship, the history and the display is first class. The one of a kind tour is well organized and very educational. Be sure to plan at least several hours. The real history buff could spend a whole day there. I would wear close toed shoes for the ladders and tight spaces. Be sure to be ready to take tons of pics too. Bring headphones for your audio tours."
164,Homecoming,It is amazing to actually be on an aircraft carrier. All the pictures cannot truly depict the size or technology of these ships. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would have loved to have spent more time on the ship because there is so much to see and learn.
165,Awesome Experience,"take at least 4-5 hours to do this, we were limited on time and tried to do it in about 3 hours and it wasn't enough time. The staff that i encountered were all retired military volunteers and naturally extremely knowledgeable. we did not do any of the virtual/interactive things on board, just the self guided Audio tour. Definitely needed more time. will certainly go back."
166,Family fun,"The USS Midway is a great spot in San Diego!  There is so much history on this ship and theres a lot of docents walking around the ship to answer questions and tell you about their experiences aboard the ship.  History doesn't get any more real than this!  You definetly need 3 hours to do the ship any justice, about an hour on the flight deck (you want nice weather for this hour), an hour to stage and do the guided tour (included in the admission cost) of the upper control areas, and about an hour below the hangar deck.  Great view of the city and Coronado from the flight deck as well.  Everyone was super helpful and very interesting to listen to!  We highly recommend a stop to see the USS Midway!"
167,Life on an Aircraft,This is a must see for anyone interested in the a Navy or fighter planes. So much history. Self guided tour with recordings to learn as you go. Most of the staff is ex-military with so much information to share.
168,Yellow Hats Are Amazing,This was my second time visiting the USS Midway and I loved it just as much as I had four years ago. There is so much to see and learn about the Navy at this museum. It was very well done and totally worth your time while in San Diego. I don't stop and read every sign at museums and spent two hours on the ship. You could easily spend four to five if you wanted to read everything about the Midway.
169,Incredible trip into history,The whole experience was amazing!!!I loved the penny machinesAlso loved seeing the downstairs from the flight deck where the captains were I think
170,Family visit,It was a great time on board the USS Midway. You can either engage an audio-aided self tour or talk to some of the veteran guides on board.
171,Very awe-inspiring visit,"Great museum, really interesting. Honestly too much to see and you get a bit burnt out trying to see it all. Make sure to see the movie. LOTS of walking and stairs, exits and signage could be improved."
172,Loved Captain Paul! ,Went here back in November. If you are a history buff or into navy vessels or like aircrafts this is a must do! There is so much to see. If you are crazy like me and like to read everything you will need to be there all day and still probably won't see it all. My favorite part was listening to the ex fighter pilots on the deck telling their stories. It was the highlight of my short trip to San Diego.
173,Get there early to be ahead of the crowds,This is a really fascinating museum.  You learn so much about life on a carrier and how it works.  The docents are amazing.  Plan to spend the day since there is lots to do and see.
174,Awesome,Can say enough about the museum and all the staff Living in San Fran my son who is in a power wheelchair has wanted to go on the Hornet but they have not installed elevators while the Midway went our of their way to accommodate people of all disabilities. Ramps and elevators to almost all areas and the docents were very helpful.
175,Simply amazing!,". First, this is the first museum intro movie that I stayed awake for. Used actual footage for parts of the story. There was a variety of planes (including John Glenn’s fighter.). The docents were everywhere and knowledgeable. I only had an hour, so I have to go back and see the living quarters and the galley. There is the statue of the VJ Day kiss and a statue tribute to Bob Hope nearby. Seeing everything and walking take about 2hours."
176,Awesome...Awesome...Awesome,The Veteran Tour Guides on the USS Midway Museum were so friendly and knowledgeable about this retired Navy carrier. It was educational and enjoyable to walk throughout the vessel.  We received personal headsets to listen to historic information during our visit.  I highly recommend you visit this museum!
177,Amazing experience,"Went to The USS Midway and had an awesome time. Lots of walking/stairs but what do you expect on an aircraft carrier. Also Veterans that served we’re doing the tours and you could ask any questions about the ship,aircrafts and etc. Highlight of the trip. Highly recommended"
178,Docents are awesome,Thoroughly enjoyed the audio tour. Enjoyed all the “yellow hat” docents who shared their own experiences within the navy. We started out tour at 2pm. Our only regret is that the visits to the bridge stopped before we’d gotten there. It would have been a great finale...we just didn’t realize we needed to get there by about 4pm in order to see it.
179,Awesome to see,"We spent a few hours here, could have stayed longer. So much history, and the Docents on staff were extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and had their own military experiences to share; take time to engage in conversation with these amazing men and women!"
180,Awesome Midway,"So much to see and great, knowledgeable docents there to give you more information. Very awe inspiring and humbling."
181,One of the best USN Museum Ships,"I have to hand it to the Americans, they know how to make the experience better.  The island tour (the sticky up bit on the flight deck) is done by a vet that served on the ship and their contribution to your experience is fantastic.  The rest of the ship is interesting and there is always someone on hand to point you in the right direction or answer any questions you may have.  Great day, thank you."
182,Unique Experience.,"Plan to spend at least half a day in order to see everything.  The ship is huge. Individual recorded self guided tours, lots of docents to help direct and answer questions. Multiple exhibits with films and live speakers, see everything from the engine room to the bridge. Lots of walking and narrow passageway. Big parking lot next door that costs but you pay with cc  for 3 hours at a time. Cafe and gift shop on board.Many airplanes to see and children can sit inside them lots of picture taking opportunities."
183,Enjoyable and educational.,"The USS Midway is a must see attraction when in San Diego. The history of the ship is fascinating, and the audio guides help bring it to life for those of us not familiar with life on an aircraft carriers.It made me appreciate the sacrifice that so many have made so that we can enjoy our freedom in the US and around the world."
184,Great history lesson on the midway,There is so much to see aboard this carrier.   The information you get for the men that served aboard the ship helps you understand so much more what it was like when it was active. Well worth the cost.
185,A Naval aircraft carrier. I'm a docent and volunteer onboard. This ship has over a thousand visitors a day. The children,"What an amazing ship. Luckly for me it was walking distance from my hotel. My wife wasn't interested, her loss. The care and knowledge the staff I met onsite was informative. The sheer scale of ship come to light when you walk the top deck."
186,nice collection of aircrafts,"Mesmerizing time on the USS MIDWAY. The ship is kept in amazing condition. The tour guides/ docents were informative, friendly, and inspiring. You can tell they love telling the story of this great ship. I stayed for the last showing of the movie below deck and it was an awesome production. Highly recommended for all ages, although some climbing could be strenuous for younger and older guests."
187,A joy trip,"Touring an aircraft carrier was on my bucket list.  So while visiting San Diego I got to tour the Midway!  It was better than my expectations as we got to see everything there was to see.  It was amazing to see how the crew lived and just how big the ship really was!  We spent 5 hours on the ship as I didn’t want to miss anything.  And, we did not hurry. The literature says to allow 3-4 hours.  It was not very crowded so the docents had time to spend talking to us.  I highly recommend this tour!"
188,Highlight of my trip in San Diego ,What makes this museum tremendous is not only is it a floating museum but it has tremendous docents and the free audio tours explain everything. You have access to most of the ship and can get very close to the planes.  You find out about how planes takeoff and land on the aircraft carrier.  It is at your own pace and is definitely worth a visit.Tip: there is both a student and AAA discount.
189,Amazing view of history!,What a great piece of our military history and opportunity to see how a carrier is a small City that defends our nation worldwide. We were thankful for the many volunteers that made the visit informative and enlightening. The gentleman that gave the tour of the island was knowledgeable and made it great experience.
190,Visiting a friend’s former home,"This wonderful museum tells the story of a time in our country that should never be forgotten. It is large! it is awe-inspiring. There are many volunteers to help tell the story as well as an audio guide for independent touring.  It may be overwhelming to very small children, and it may be difficult for those folks who are challenged with walking too much or challenged with being in small tight places.  There are lots of stairs.  I did not notice an elevator, but you could check the web site.  It IS worth the trip if you are able."
191,USS Midway Museum worth the time,This is an incredible museum.  The docents are so knowledgeable and entertaining.  So much fun and just a great way to spend the day in San Diego.   Highly recommend this as a day event while visiting San Diego
192,Great way to spend a little extra time.,Great place to visit if it’s raining! Loads for the family to see what life was like on an aircraft carrier.
193,great place to view naval history,I am a bit of a nerd when it comes to war stuff so this museum was definitely one of the best things that I have done in San Diego. The planes were awesome to look at and have a peak inside and considering this ship was the biggest in the world for a few years was pretty cool as well. The tour of the control tower was my favorite as we had a veteran who served on the ship take us around and tell stories that he had of his experiences on the ship. The city of San Diego should be incredibly proud of this museum as it can even intrigue those who aren't even interested in ships or planes. I went to this museum in February 2017 and am dying to go back to this museum!
194,An absolute must-visit for San Diego!,"Terrific representation of life on an aircraft carrier!  Dozens of great exhibits, many areas of the ship are open, and the docents add invaluable flavor to your experience.Tips: if you have children, stop at the Info Booth and pick up a Junior Pilot Card - a great way for kids and families to learn.Make your first stop the Island (Captain’s Bridge) Tour off of the flight deck.  It’s the only docent guided tour on the ship and first come, first served."
195,Very unique experience with an up close view of the US military,"Young and old will enjoy and be educated by their visit to the Midway. Near the Cruise Ship terminal it gets a lot of foot traffic from visitors. Like wise the Star of India, a period sailing ship, is just up the street and is another popular attraction. A nice way to spend some time enjoying the waterfront."
196,Great experience and a lot of history,"Talked the family into doing this and I am so glad I did......To walk back in history and walk around this enormous floating destroyer.... We spent hours on board walking through and reading as much as we could, as it was just an awe inspiring experience.The ship is so well maintained with all the tour guides knowing so much about the history. You need to wear comfortable shows for sure, as it is non stop walking and climbing, but so well worth it. The planes and helicopters on the top deck, which you can go in and out of. The simulators on the main deck...Make sure you grab the audio experience, as this is really something special to listen to the commentators talking about it all.We booked online which bypassed the long queues....Genuinely, I can't recommend it enough......Must do and have an amazing time.....Brilliant.......(even if war, ships and plans don't interest you), this place is just simply worth it......"
197,Lots to see!,This is a fantastic museum. The Docents are knowledgeable and it is a grave reminder of how delicate democracy is.
198,Plan on spending the whole day here!,"This huge and beautiful Ship is an actual de-commissioned aircraft carrier, and has quite the collection of amazing aircraft on board. Most of these planes were built right here in Southern California. The feeling is very similar to being on the “Intrepid” in NYC.There were plenty of volunteers everywhere who made our visit informative and enlightening. There were several presentations on different parts of the ship, and we were able to attend a few, and ask questions to the docents who patiently answered every one of the queries in great detail.There are lots of activities and photo-ops for families and young children.  There is something for everybody here. Views of the San Diego harbor, the city and the beautiful bridge were amazing.We spent an entire morning here going through an incredible world of a different era. We felt like we could have spent the entire day here, and would love to come back and explore the places that we did not get the chance to see this first time.Highly recommended it as a “Must Do” activity while in San Diego."
199,Great tour,"Another great cooking class experience in Puerto Vallarta. We decided to mix it up a little and chose the Plobano Mole class at the Chocolate Museum in PV.  We booked through the very reliable Viator service. We started with a visit to the Mercado where the class choose the ingredients - 4 different locations. Then back to the Chocolate Museum to prepare the lunch. We broke up into 3 working teams and rotated the various “prep” tasks.  The prep time is lengthy but well worth it with the freshest most delicious Mole Chicken with rice ever. This is our 4 cooking class in PV booked through Viator. We’ve loved all of them. If visiting PV - give it a try - you learn a lot about the culture, unique (to Visitors from US) foods and preparation.  You know everything is fresh because you have prepared the meal!!"
200,Bucket list check!,"What an amazing exhibit, well maintained and presented. The staff and volunteers manning the various main points of interest are generally ex service personal keen to share their knowledge about the vessel / items. Their enthusiasm for the task is abundantly clear. One learns heaps of interesting things about the weapons, aircraft, procedure and tasks needed to run the carrier. I guess a lot still applies on todays vessels. On a score out of 10 they get a 20 !!. Big Tip, see the Conning Tower first before the crowd as the stair way and bridge area is confined."
201,Too impressive to miss,Where else can you visit such an iconic and historic aircraft carrier? We listened to a veteran (yellow hat volunteer)  describe how he  made 65 aircraft landings.  Give yourself enough time to see it all including the lower levels.
202,What an amazing place! ,"The Midway is so much more than a museum. This ship has a history that should be taught in every history class in the future! What is the Midway? A ship that sailed through WWII, and in more recent history, the ship that helped our soldiers and citizens escape from the fall of Saigon. The tour guides were there and will share the stories of reality with you. The planes are those which flew from WWII through Vietnam and beyond, the pilots are there to share their stories. This is a once in a lifetime chance to hear these stories and feel their compassion, my son and his wife moved to San Diego 2 years ago, I've traveled there many times and visited the Midway twice. It's worth the visit."
203,Nice displays,"Great visit.  We spent 3 and half hours.  I could have spent all day there easily, but the kids were starting to tire.  Loved that so many of the Docents had served on the ship."
204,Terrific museum,Impressive is all I can say.  I love the military movies and history having just missed the Vietnam Conflict. I am also a retired educator and have a sincere appreciation of history and service. My wife and I visited on President Day weekend as part of a west coast vacation. The ship is magnificent in size and scope.  The veterans that serve as guide represent the best of that generation. The inventory of air craft and n deck is extensive. A must see for all ages.
205,Best Museum in San Diego!,This is an amazing floating city. Each level has such interesting facts. It makes me wish I could have seen it in its prime to see how it was run.
206,History Abounds,"The U.S.S. Midway is an amazing experience and well worth the visit.  The Midway is massive and holds many exhibits including many planes that you and your children actually can climb into and sit in.  Kids seemed to love the visit.  There also are veterans present who talk about their experiences and show film clips.  It was an amazing, imformative visit."
207,So cool! Needed more time!,"Having visited San Diego for over a decade and even living there for a year, I can't believe it took me so long to visit. This is an amazing part of US history and should be visited by all. The free audio tour is filled with great information. Pro tip: book your tickets online. It's a little cheaper and you get to go straight in."
208,Excellent Military Muse,I am not a hardcore military junkie but have enjoyed adventure novels featuring aircraft carrier operations. I really enjoyed the chance to see the features I had to read about.
209,San Diego 2020,"I brought my wife and (2) boys to this attraction. I spent my time in the Navy working on F-14 Tomcats. So, I spent a lot of time on aircraft carrier flight decks. Having the opportunity to bring my kids onboard was very special for me. I was able to walk around at my own pace. I Spent as much time as I wanted on any aspect of the ship. The volunteers were great and very dedicated. You will want to wear comfortable shoes and I would recommend a bottle of water. Plan on spending about 3 hours minimum on this experience. A quick snack wouldn’t be a bad idea. Lots of ladders and tight spaces but, that’s what life on these things is like. The entrance fee was very fair IMO. I would get there about 945 am. Get your tickets early and then head immediately to the bridge tour. If you wait, you may be waiting a long time."
210,It's small but the Kids will Love it.,"As impressive as this ship is, and it IS impressive, I don’t think that this museum would be what it is today without the men and women who work here and share their knowledge of how the Midway operates.  I urge you to take the small tours to the bridge and to stop and listen as these veterans, many of whom actually served on the Midway, explain in detail how the ship was navigated around the world and how it launched and landed planes like clockwork.  The collective knowledge of these veterans was captivating and really made this museum a must-see for anyone visiting San Diego."
211,Must see,"Hugely impressive. Good talks from veterans, good audio guide too. Learned a lot! Lots to see and do."
212,Pretty awesome ,"History, education and jaw-dropping displays is what you'll get here. The museum is affordable and well worth the experience as the Museum curators truly care about customer service."
213,Love touring ships,"Educational and unique experience to learn about the internal workings of a battle ship! The docents are outstanding, the simulators are fun and checking out the small helicopters on the deck is an exciting experience!"
214,DO IT!,"Midway is sooo worth visiting. The self guided tour is awesome, as you have headpiece that you can use at your own pace at any of the displays that interest you. The simulators are really worth the extra cost, fun and informative. There are extra tours to participate in, the one that goes to the control rooms and led by knowledgable Docents are very interesting, and give another unique view from high on the ship."
215,Must SEE!,"Skipping the line was clearly the way to go, saved us a bunch of time.  It was cool to meet some of the men that actually served on the ship."
216,A Must See in San Diego,"If only for the docents, this is worth the admission price. Rare to see volunteers who love their jobs so much. Friendly, funny, knowledgeable, and stationed all over the ship. I understand why people by annual passes. It's impossible to see it all and absorb the details in one day. Fascinating to get a small glimpse into the lives of sailors serving aboard a modern warship. Kudos to all who serve now and all who served the Navy and Marines in the past."
217,Take the tours and listen to the volunteers,Incredible walk back through time! Amazing displays and incredible Docents/volunteers. Allow 3-4 hours to take out all in.
218,Great experience ,"Plan to spend all day here. Lots to see, learn and visit. The yellow hats are vets ready to share info with you. They have amazing info be sure to talk to them. Important to see:-The Island-presentation on the Flight Deck about what has to happen for the planes to fly."
219,Wow.  Just wow!,so cool ship.So nice museum Lots of things close to seea must do in san diego Very good guide tour and people so friendly
220,Interesting,Went in February.  Midway move was a great piece of history to understand the naming of the carrier.  Self guided with audio was a nice way to go through the ship.  There was a section of the control deck that was guided with super guide.  Our guide was Bob who was super.
221,Amazing attraction!,"This is truly a must-see and must-experience attraction.  An opportunity to climb aboard one of the Navy's finest military (and humanitarian) vessels that sail the world's high seas.  Truly, a one in a lifetime experience."
222,I was wowed,The USS Midway Museum was a treasure trove of fascinating information. What made this especially impactful were the docents who actually served on this ship in some capacity. Their information came from first hand experience and they were all so happy to be teaching us about life aboard an aircraft carrier.
223,Explore a Part of History,"Awesome place to visit , the inner part of the shop is so interesting and amusing , it’s a must os San Diego"
224,Fun for everyone,"An excellent way to spend 3-4 hours!  Docents are great along with activities for kids and teens.  No restaurant, just a food market but signs indicate a cafe is coming."
225,So big! So eye-opening! And educational.,"Had wonderful experience at this place. Staff were highly  knowledgable, shared some of their rich experiences. Engine rooms, (lots of physics to learn here)  were simply superb. Worth visiting, May bee good to keep 3 hours of time to explore its potential. Thanks to the staff for an excellent guided tour. Audio sets need N upgrade to wireless headsets, this will  be more helpful to click some pics while touring. I highly recommend visiting this place."
226,Very interesting,Visited over the weekend. The Midway is a floating museum that shows what day to day life was like on the carrier during its time as an active commissioned ship. It also has many aircraft representative of the types that operated on the carrier throughout its nearly fifty year history. I was excited when I saw my old helicopter squadron had one of its aircraft as part of the museum. The mannequins down in the dental office will give you a chuckle.
227,A lot to see on the ship. ,"A terrific expose of historical memorabilia from WWII. The planes and helicopters are in great shape. Most of which can be toured. There are numerous lectures on deck being given throughout the day. There are interactive exhibits inside the museum and a great museum store. We spent many hours there and had a bite to eat in their cafe in the aft section of the flight deck as well. It was a special day. I felt grateful to all those who had served on this ship and fought for our country, even more after being on the Midway. Go and experience this treasure trove of history."
228,First-hand look at history,"What a fantastic ship to visit.  It is huge,  interesting,  filled with planes, history,  and facts. Great volunteers to help explain the history.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a lot. It is now reopened after the CORONAVIRUS shutdown."
229,Awestruck experience,"Very cool, great displays of aircraft below deck and on the flight deck. Very informative recordings at each display. Lots of history to see."
230,so central ,"The USS Midway is one of the top 5 museums to visit in the nation. It’s exhibits are exquisite and tell a historical saga of the ship’s exploits and adventures — entertaining for young and old!  To top your visit off, try visiting in December when you can gaze upon San Diego’s beautiful Christmas lights from the unique viewpoint atop the ship’s flight. Time your visit right and catch San Diego‘s “Parade of Lights” — an armada of finely decorated small boats navigating the bay right past the Midway. Uniquely San Diego!"
231,A “must do” museum!,"One of the best ""floating"" museums that I've ever visited. Well staffed with knowledgeable volunteers, many interesting tours and displays. I especially enjoyed hearing the talks given by actual fighter pilots sharing their experiences taking off and landing on a carrier. It was fascinating."
232,Night time event!,How many times have you been on an aircraft carrier. Take your time and explore all there is to see on the flight deck and below.
233,Loved It!!!,An awesome opportunity to take my family to see what had been a friend of my wife’s home for one of his deployments as a fighter pilot.  Got to meet several of the great men and women who served on Her.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to provide first hand teaching to their teens about our great Navy and how demanding their jobs are.  Instant respect for our men and women in uniform
234,Primo!,"Very well done museum, with the Docettes all knowledgeable, friendly vets, with real life experiences."
235,Go on a Weekday,Pretty awesome to see the old technology that was way ahead of its time and stayed in operation for all those years. And the additions and renovations to the ship are crazy.
236,If you enjoy nautical or aviation history you MUST visit,What an awesome opportunity to board an air craft carrier and immerse yourself in a very unique experience. Do you like history? Or wonder what life would be like on a ship? Your ticket includes a audio tour device which allows you to scan a recording on numerous exhibit boards all around the ship on all levels. Make sure to watch the short film and take the tour of the “island” or control center. We were there for 2.5 hours and could have stayed longer. I was the one who originally wasn’t too excited to visit this museum (was husband’s idea) but then I was the one who didn’t want to leave.
237,The passion of the volunteers!,"I bought our (senior) tickets on TripAdvisor and got $4 discount per ticket  There was no line when we got there at 10:30.  We beat the crowd!  We were there until 4:30pm!  The Yellow Hats (volunteer retired Navy, for the most party) were really interesting. Great talks about launching and recovering planes, and the Island. Good 15 min. Movie about the battle of Midway. Don’t miss the tour below decks too!  We were lucky that there was a retirement ceremony on the flight deck, and we got to see the battle group with carrier Teddy Roosevelt depart for a 7 month deployment."
238,Must See,"This is a great Museum, especially since San Diego is the home of the Pacific Fleet. The information in the Museum is really interesting, plus you see the airplanes on the flight deck, and can access them.  Additionally, you can see the day to day schedule, the flight deck, the use of technology, and what duties are performed by sailors and officers. And, what the officers and personnel do, and where they hang out, and sleep.  It is so worth visiting.    5 Stars."
239,USS Midway Museum,"The Midway is an amazing floating museum of naval aviation history, with exceptional exhibits and helpful, knowledgeable guides, most of whom had served on board. Fascinating and unforgettable"
240,AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!,"Quite impressive from a distance, almost overwhelming once you get on board.  Enough to see and do on board to occupy an entire day.  Walking through the compartments really gives a sense of the size as well as the confines of being aboard an aircraft carrier.  Nice collection of aircraft.  Well worth the trip."
241,Loved the USS Midway,"The Midway Museum is a great experience for multiple generations.  The sheer scale of the flight deck, the location-specific audio recordings for the different areas, planes and functions on the ship add a great deal of interesting information to a self-guided walk around.  And the presence of the volunteer docents who served on the Midway or similar ships adds authenticity and a real personal aspect.  Make sure you set aside a span of 3 hours or so to get the most out of this experience that delivers real value!"
242,Well Worth It!,"The Midway Museum is a great experience for multiple generations.

Make sure you set aside a span of 3 hours or so to get the most out of this experience that delivers real value!"
243,Visit history!  Not in WWII but named after that epoch battle,You can spend a full day on the ship. If nothing else just due to her size. It takes a while to walk from one end to the other. 5000+ people use to live on this ship. Fought a few wars and made it into retirement.
244,Very cool,"Visited the Midway during my ships 49th anniversary reunion. Bought back alot of memories, as my ship used to sail with the Midway back in the day. As a matter of fact, one of the helos on the flight deck of the Midway museum was actually the helo that was assigned to my ship for ASW operations!! SO many memories!!"
245,Awesome!,was an excellent time going through the USS Midway like going back in time to a different ereworkers were very nice and knowledgeable.  displays offered lots to learn about
246,Fantastic,"IMHO, one of the best attractions in San Diego! Loved every aspect of experience from below deck and on deck museum of aircraft, to conning tower, to sailor's and officers quarters, galleys, and hospital stations."
247,A fascinating experience!!,"I had the misfortune of hurting my back while on vacation in San Diego, so I looked up things I could do in a wheelchair.  The USS Midway offered wheelchairs for loan.  I could see a decent amount of the ship and there were video stations to show the parts I couldn't get to.  I didn't want to miss out on the Midway and I was not disappointed.  Also, the staff were amazing, offering help whenever needed and offering more information about the ship while my brother-in-law toured the other parts of the ship.  I was also offered lots of help getting to the cab coming and going.  If you want to see a sight the can accommodate someone with mobility issues I would definitely recommend the USS Midway."
248,Great Visit,"Enjoy all these sights and stop for a bite or a sip or both, during your walk.  The tour guides at the Midway are informative and delightful.  Take the Ferry to Coronado and Uber/Lyft to the Hotel Del."
249,Interesting,"great couple hours loads of info and wonderful view of San Diego,people that are there for you know their stuff ."
250,Outstanding presentation of History,"Went with three kids ages 11-7 and grandparents. Spent 4 hours and still didn't see everything! The audio tour is fantastic, so much detail and personal perspective. Bought digital tickets in advance and had no problem getting in. Docents that volunteer were amazing!"
251,Great Visit,The USS Midway is absolutely incredible. A great history lesson!I recommend this to anyone that loves America or that wants to understand some of our military history.
252,Fantastic museum,"Having flown to and from the aircraft carrier Abe Lincoln, I was eager to learn about the Midway.  Ironically the Lincoln is in the harbor across the way.  Really enjoyed the docents and the volunteers who are there to talk about the Midway.  Could have spent the whole day there."
253,Five star experience,"It is an interesting museum developed into an old Navy Ship of the USA, namely ""Midway Aircraft Carrier"" You will have some chances to learn about the details of a aircraft carrier, jets, naval life, and history about the 2nd World War Period. You might remember some scenes from the old Hollywood movie, ""Top Gun"" when you will see some jet planes on the deck of the museum."
254,"great history, awesome tour","On the open deck they show each historical iteration of the planes and helicopters they used.  They showed how the bombs were loaded.  Kids could sit in the pilot seats of some of the planes.  Below, the different areas had scenarios set up to show how the sick bay, radar station, communications, mess hall with typical food and tin trays, bunks, pay station, etc worked.  I was surprised at how many miles of electrical cable the ship needed and how huge it is.. An added bonus is that the ""kissing statue"" is easily visible just below the main deck."
255,Proud to be an American,"Get an idea how sailors live and work on an aircraft carrier, and explore history while touring this museum."
256,Great museum,"very fun. it's amazing to see how a large air craft carrier operates, and also so many naval aircrafts. it would take at least a few hours to finish the tour but it could be longer. the public parking is a problem around that area. we took a few rounds and couldnt find any spot. at the end we parked at the parking lot of a hotel nearby ( inter-continental if I remember correctly ?)"
257,US Midway Museuw,Ex-Navy-Often I find myself doing a return visit to the Midway Carrier.So much to see and do.Plus the views from the flightdeck of San Diego Bay are amazing.
258,Good Activity for All Ages,"Most museums are real cool buildings exhibiting real cool stuff. This museum is the real deal, the USS Midway aircraft carrier and just about every plane and helicopter that lifted off her deck. Flight suits, navigation equipment, life boats, ready rooms, airplane cockpits, you name it. And the tour guides are all super friendly. The self-guided tours are easy to use as well. Don’t miss the tour of the bridge, but watch your head or you’ll knock yourself out!"
259,Educational experience,"There are special events almost ever evening. If you were a crew member aboard the USS Midway you are given a lifetime ""Free"" membership. If you come to San Diego make sure your visit the USS Midway."
260,Plan on being here all day,"If you're into the history of our Navy and or just interested in seeing an aircraft carrier, this is a must see. I strongly encourage you to be there at opening to allow for enough time to see the entire ship."
261,USS Midway Tour,Amazing history. Incredible men telling the stories. Up close and personal to the planes and all areas. 6’4” and able to navigate the small passages with only a little anxiety. Lol. Very cool tour. Amazing piece of history.
262,A Fascinating Piece of History,So much more to see than the obvious flight deck. The living and working quarters are very interesting.
263,Great History Lesson and a taste of life at see.,"Awesome. Be there early to be in line for the purchase of tickets. Audio tour allows hearing of first person memories of men who worked at various stations or on various aircraft. These really add to the exhibits. Wonderful display of the aircraft on both the flight and hanger decks. The exhibit on how the Midway assisted with the evacuation of Hanoi was moving. Hard to appreciate the scale of the ship even when on it. Need at least 3 hours and we didn't see or read everything. The displays below decks reveal the massive scale of infrastructure support required to operate a floating air force that one wouldn't even think about, unless you take this tour."
264,The Midway,"4 hours on the Midway is hardly enough. A wonderful trip back in time. Efficient, knowledgeable, helpful staff who have ALL the answers."
265,Afternoon Well Spent,"Visited here on a Sunday morning with my wife, I’m recovering from a broken foot so wasn’t keen on lots of stairs.  No huge lines and there were lifts up onto the main deck. Everything about this tour was well done, ex crewmen and pilots giving talks and taking time to talk to people.  I’d definitely go again if I was in San Diego."
266,The Military Histrory of the USA,"The twenty bucks that you spend to get on the Midway will be the best money you spent on your San Diego vacation! There is so much history and information on this ship that I recommend planning a whole day around it, they will stamp your hand so you can go next door to the Fishmarket and get some lunch, but don't forget to go back to the Midway and do some shopping! The store is as amazing as the boat!"
267,An afternoon well spent,"The hotel I stay is far from Midway Museum, I take could not stand in line to buy a ticket.Since I had this ticket, I could enter the Museum smoothly.It is very useful for me."
268,Great Tour,So much to see.... amazing ship that gives you a little taste of what an aircraft carrier must be like to crew. Good selection of fighters and helis and great fun sitting in cockpits.If you’re in san diego (or close by) definitely stop in.
269,For History Fans Well Worth The Trip,"In January, there was no ticket line. Your ticket includes a free audio tour.  Bring your wired headphones to plug into jack unless you like holding a speaker to your ear. Visitors enter at the hangar deck. The movie in the theatre summarizes the air battle and runs every 30”.  Well defined and clean bathrooms. Parents can self park strollers in designated areas. Bring a sweater because it can be cool and breezy. Outdoor and indoor seating for packed lunch or little market to buy. After the movie, if you’re an adult, go to the yellow hat docent speaker up on the flight deck. He is marvelous in his story telling descriptions of how to land a jet on an air craft carrier. I spent 2.5 hours here and it wasn’t enough time. For kids, the audio guide has kid oriented options which keeps them entertained. For a portion of the self tour there are stairs into certain rooms so some of the ship is limited for those mobility challenged. I love airplanes and helicopters and there are many along with good signage for those who don’t want or can’t use the audio guide. If you are done with zoos and animals, this is a good place to come to in San Diego. Also, maybe good during inclement weather."
270,A must see,"I've been several times, and it never gets old.  The docents are often veterans who served on the ship, and can answer all manner of questions for the curious.  It's a floating city, with all the necessary services. The aircraft on deck are pretty neat."
271,Great Experience,Excellent.  Interesting for all ages except very young children.  Best time to go is at 10am. Title or no line.  Week days best if possible.All volunteers are ex service people and very informative.  A must visit when in San Diego.
272,Fun for everyone.,"For Navy families and history buffs, this is a must see. For those of us who have never been on a carrier, it's difficult to imagine the size but by visiting the USS Midway, we can see for ourselves what it is like. The many veterans who serve as tour guides have a wealth of information to share. We were able to get parking easily and enjoy the street vendors during our visit."
273,OUTSTANDING,Excellent display.   Well presented with outstanding local volunteers who are more than ready to spend time sharing their knowledge.  Also well located on warf area and next to other tourist facilities as well.
274,Christmas Lights,Wonderful place to spend a day. At least 1/2 day. Extremely interesting. Don’t miss it. I could spend 3 days here. Great guides.
275,It is nice to save time,A really nice trip to a behemoth. The planes and the trip to the starboard all in all a must in San Diego Downtown
276,"For all ages! Kids,Vets, couples. 70% accessible ",There wasn’t a line to skip!  At 1400hrs anyway!One of the great museums.Could have spent all day there
277,An awesome experience,Was in San Diego for a cruise and had a few days to explore. The Midway was across the street from my hotel and since I always try to tour each cities battle ship if they have one this was a must for me. It didn't disappoint. The favorite deck of these ships for me are below where everyone lived. You get a free audio with your admission and it was one of the best I have heard. This is a must see if you have a few hours.
278,Amazing!,"Try to do the tour of the tower (it’s free, you just have to go to the tower). It gives you a very good overview. The volunteers are fantastic, nice and knowledgeable."
279,Great Museum,"If you are in San Diego, the Midway is a great place to visit, make sure you have a hour or two to walk around, because there is a lot to see, there is a cafe there too"
280,Great piece of Naval history,"Everything worth saying about this absolutely magnificent and majestic ""city on the water"" has been said over 29,000 times before. However, it is absolutely necessary to add a few words of the ultimate respect I have never fully understood until visiting this ship. The designers, engineers, craftspeople, the military services and anybody else involved in the history of the USS MIDWAY share just an unbelievable genius to have worked together as a team through astounding times to produce such a craft.It is a humbling and overwhelming experience to walk miles through this ship and just have a  miniscule inkling of what it was to sail the world's waters in such a beast.To think that this was just one of hundreds of naval vessels throughout US history is beyond comprehension."
281,Skip the Line - USS midway ,Excellent tour made great by the volunteer veterans who have the experience and memories of serving on carriers including the midway. Great seeing all the old jets and copters actually used on the carrier and even prior with its namesake the battle of midway.
282,Meh,"History lovers (or hell...even Top Gun film fans) this is a MUST see! This is an absolute treasure trove of knowledge. Whether you are in the hangar, below deck, or flight deck exhibits... you will never see everything in one visit. You can be guided by free portable audio as you explore through out the midway. The flight deck has over 20 aircraft to see. A few of them you can even step inside the cock pit to see how it felt. Below deck has been full restored to give an idea of what life was life for service members aboard this floating city. Speaking of them, stop and hear a short lecture on the flight deck from a ""Yellow hat"", who actually served on the ship! You can see them below deck to tell even further stories. There's a little snack bar you can get sandwiches, chips, salads, and even beer/wine. Which can be enjoyed looking out over the harbor. The gift shop is stocked with a ton of cool gear, including Top Gun Gear!"
283,Best bargain in San Diego,Awesome piece of history - do not pass up the oppurtunity to spend the day there.... you'll be happy you did.
284,Incredible tour!,"I wasn’t sure about this one, especially on Valentine’s Day....ended up thoroughly enjoying the ship, very special talking to and hearing from the veteran volunteers. The on deck presentations about take off and recovery was fascinating! We parked in a 3 hour bay and so didn’t have time to do everything so we had our ticket stamped and returned for another 3 hours the following day (didn’t know you could do that!) so $26 for a 2 day trip was awesome value!!!!. Still didn’t quite have enough time so plan to come back again some time. Plan on arriving early as parking is busy, mid week is better, much quieter and buy your ticket in advance to avoid the line! It was busy on Saturday so we breezed past the lines!"
285,Tourist stop,"The USS Midway is amazing. I only had about 2.5 hours to spend there, and it wasn't nearly enough. I could have easily spent a whole day. Be aware, the island (command center) can only be seen with a guide. Tours end about 45 minutes before closing, so don't wait until the end of the day to visit the island."
286,Good museum. ,"The Midway should be a must see in San Diego.  Plan on at least 3 hours.  If you go first thing in the morning go up to the Island tour on the flight deck first thing as the lines get pretty long.  The volunteers are great and are happy to share their stories, be sure to take the time to talk to them."
287,Great day for casual naval aviation fan,"Wonderful experience for any age, made better by the personal testimonials of the naval aviators who served on the Midway and now volunteer as Docents/Yellow Hats to tell their war stories and answer questions. Special shout-out to Captain Paul, who gave us an exciting  play-by-play of how to land aircraft on the Midway!"
288,Fascinating History Experience,You won’t be able to see this all in one day. Get your ticket stamped and come back for more tomorrow. The volunteer staff made it all worthwhile. They were all so passionate that you could easily tell that these people have actually lived the life that they taught us about.
289,Must-do activity in San Diego,"What a great way to spend an afternoon, or most of a day, exploring the USS Midway Aircraft Carrier.  You'll love the planes on the deck, the big guns, the living quarters where a small town worth of Navy Sailors lived and worked to support this magnificent vessel."
290,Impressive,"Went on rainy day, no problem. Tour inclcudes individual radio information which is great, access to fore and aft compartments including captains and enlisted sailors quarters, galley, CAC, post office, dental and infirmary, hangar deck with gift shop and cafe. Flight deck all era planes and helicopters. Volunteer veterans are awesome, many who were onboard during service."
291,A humbling experience,Recommend visiting if in the San Diego area. Go early in the morning and start on the deck with the planes. There is much to see. The Midway is amazing!  All the volunteers are knowledgeable and have a passion when they talk about Midway. The late morning and early afternoon became busy with school field trips while I was there. Be sure to go below deck. There is a WWII movie that is 15 minutes long - don’t miss!  Tickets are $5 cheaper when you purchase on TripAdvisor.
292,A Must See!,"By a measure of #1, this would be one of the most memorablevisits that one could have.  This ship is an icon to the US Navy and the history surrounding the Miday is just amazing.The compliment our 5 plus hour visit were the volunteers, some of whom were crew on this amazing vessell when it was an operation war ship.  I am from Sydney Australia and recall the Midway's visit in 1987 when it sailed into Sydney Harbour, what a sight it was.  the exhibits and the storyboards told of a wonderful history contibuting to the peace of the world including the evcutation  of US interests from Vietnam on 30 April 1975.  An event to remember.  Should you decide to travel to San Diego the Midway is a must.  You will need at least 4 hours to do it justice.  During my visit I noticed a lot of former crew, many well into their 70's visiting their old ship.  Their love of the ship and their patriotism was something to behold.  It is no wonder that the Midway is the #1 tourist attreaction in San Diego"
293,So much history!,$10 to park the $26 per person is astronomically to high for a historic landmark. But at least you can get tons of walking in.
294,A Lesson in History,Do not visit at this time.It is not same experience as without COVID-19.Most of exponents you can not touch due to policies.
295,"Memorable tour of Midwa,  it is difficult to imagine the size of this vessel until you are walking around her.  I high",The Midway is a very significant warship in US Naval history both from its technical evolution as well as its participation in a number of wars and actions. Much of the ship is open for viewing. There are very knowledgeable docents as well. There is a wonderful collection of aircraft on the flight and hangar decks. The engineering spaces are also quite interesting.
296,Great piece of history,"A proud piece of USN and American history, the USS Midway is synonymous with the great City of San Diego. You can spend hours here exploring the entire ship, and you can also do a tour of the ship with one of its great and friendly docents. Many of the docents are former Navy-people themselves, eagerly sharing everything you should know about the Midway. Touring the ship requires that you constantly lift your legs to avoid hitting the knee-knockers. Every door on the ship has a knee-knocker (the door-frame is UP from the floor, ensuring compartment water-sealing, if necessary)."
297,Historical Museum,"Balboa Park is a must go to place for anyone visiting San Diego. Balboa Park could be a place to visit on it’s own. Not only are the grounds superb but the diverse number of museums provides an interest for every visitor. We have been here on a number of visits. This year we spent a day exploring the park the craftperson’s village and the Timken Museum which is small, beautiful and free. If you go download the very useful App which provides information on the art work."
298,Simply Amazing,An aircraft carrier is by itself already impressive. Learn about the battle of Midway in 1942. How 10 minutes changed the balance of the war in the Pacific.
299,Great experience!,"Midway was one of the most significant Naval Battles in WW II :  this Aircraft Carrier - commissioned 1945, decommissioned 1992 - keeps that memory alive  +  gives insights into how Navy Pilots operate, and more.It's well worth a visit to this well-run ""Museum""in San Diego Harbor - like me, you may have an interest in Aircraft, a fascination for the demanding role of Navy Pilots, enjoy Naval Vessels & their layout, or whatever - we spent 2 hours here and could have spent many more.It helps to have priorities : ours were visiting the Flight Deck, and gaining a better understanding of how that area worked. We joined a group seated around a Docent, who explained in detail, how Planes landed - I think it's called ""Retrieval"", with delicate maneuvers by the returning Pilot to grab one of 3 cables with a ""Hook"" - not easy.A nice touch, after this informative Presentation, was that giving an Answer to a simple technical Question, I was ""awarded"" a Badge.In the variety of Aircraft displayed on the Flight Deck, old familiar Pilot names were highlighted - John Glenn, Astronaut, and later Ohio Senator, for example.Asking about the late Senator John McCain, unsure if he flew A-4 Skyhawks, from Carrier ""USS Forrestal"" in the late 1960s, the abrupt, unsympathetic answer I got was ""He got shot down and captured"". Wow!We finished our far from comprehensive Tour in the Bookshop (I made a few purchases) and the Theater showing a technically-enhanced  Video about Midway.We enjoyed our visit."
