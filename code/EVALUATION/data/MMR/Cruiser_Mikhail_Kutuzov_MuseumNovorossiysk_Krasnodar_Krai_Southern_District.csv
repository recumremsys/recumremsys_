0,"Too old to rock'n'roll (on the waves), too young to die.","These slightly modified words by Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson may easily be applied to this Soviet clunker-ship.Commissioned in 1952 and decommissioned in 2000 this light cruiser of Sverdlov class was turned into a museum two years later.I always feel sad when I see such relics of yesteryears Everything's in the past, just memories left, fading present, desolate future. She urgently needs renovation. Formidable at a distance, the ship is shabby and rusty at closer look and even more forlorn once you step on board. The entrance fee is ridiculous but you may visit her only in a group so be prepared to wait until a sufficient number of tourists assembles.The tour is naturally in Russian and rather formal plus they don't show you most interesting places like the captain's bridge and the engine room (maybe because there's nothing left there?). Rather strict rules of behavour apply.It's interesting that Russian commander who gave the cruiser her name never won a single sea battle and never even took part in any. Appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian army in 1812 he lost to Napoleon the decisive battle at Borodino near Moscow then left this city but later outmaneuvred him and made La Grande Armée leave it in the most inclement weather - merciless Russian winter.Never defeating the French, hardly having won a combat in his life he got a rank of field marshal, the highest possible military order - St. George, 1st grade - was nicknamed ""Napoleon's victor"" and by and by turned into one of the greatest military leaders of Russia of all times. History is a tricky lady...As to the ship, make up your own mind. Dubious impression. Selfies at the quay might be a better alternative."
1,Interesting ship but a more thorough tour would be good,"Firstly it has to be said the decommissioned ex-Soviet navy cruiser is an impressive and imposing site, docked by the main promenade. It also happens to be photogenic for those of us who like this sort of thing.The tour itself wasn't very impressive, I wasn't overly concerned that it wasn't in English, after all this is Southern Russian and English speaking tourists are not exactly there in droves. It was more that we didn't seem to spend much time anywhere other than on the main deck, and even then didn't see inside any of the cruiser's large main guns. More significantly we didn't visit the bridge, this I consider to be the highlight of any ship tour, and thus was somewhat surprised it didn't feature. My gut feel was that the guide basically did the bare minimum, and seemed more interested in selling fridge magnets and souvenir hats to the tour participants.The pricing for the tour also appeared somewhat fluid, people seemed to pay between 200-400R dependant on how foreign they were. In hindsight I would still tour for the extra photo opportunities being on deck offered, but unless you speak Russian the tour in itself was both brief and uninformative. Oh and a far larger and no doubt cheaper choice of souvenirs were available from many stalls on the Quayside/Promenade."
2,russian hospitality vs turist 400-0,"Only when one gets on the deck, he realizes the strength and great power of this ship. Very interesting to examine the hidden parts :)"
3,Glorious,"i was waiting to  visit this ship and the first cold shower came when the man on the entrance had a heavy impolite attitude and of course not speak english. After i realized that would be our guide. After finish the group of tourists  and disembarked from ship came our turn.I To the ""kasa"" =small cashier to the entrance one other guy wrote to a paper (because also he didnt know the english language) that our price for each person was 400 Rb . ( after 15 minutes that finish our round on board and we enter to trip advisor to check if the price was normal we read some articles about 100-200 Rb ) so probably these guys cheated us. And of course when we asked him to visit the engine department or the bridge he told us that were sealed areas. so we paid 400 Rb  only for a round on deck and to the library and to the messroom of the officers and to the locked dentist place (he told us that begind this door is the dentist's surgery ). I would not recommend this place."
4,Breathtaking!,"During our Black Sea cruise (Knyaz Vladimir ship), I visit this glorious war ship:Length 210m, width 23m, crew of 1200 people, Cruiser «Mikhail Kutuzov», Named in honor of Mikhail I. Kutuzov.A must see in Novorossiysk ."
5,Another nice place to visit,Old military battle ship turned into a museum..Worth visiting. Enjoy the beautiful view from its masts and the excursion was good.
6,wait untill you see the inside quarters,"If you are not on an organized tour, just wait until a group comes by and ask to join them.  The cost is 150 rubles.  Tours are in Russian language, and you can take a lot of pictures.  Living quarters are like stepping back into time, or watching the hunt of red october.  In the officer's recreational room there is a wooden pannel with red square and Lenin.  The guide will offer to sell hats, pins, magnets etc. (so you will have to sit through a presentation of his items).  On the kiosk just outside the boat they sell tee-shirts for 300 - 350 rubles.  She had a simple one on the table, but she has plenty other interesting ones hidden. (cotton quality is not that excellent though)"
