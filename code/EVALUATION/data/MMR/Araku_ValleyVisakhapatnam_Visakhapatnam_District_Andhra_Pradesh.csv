1,One of the best valley of Eastern Ghats,The place is atop Hill. Shooting spot and leisure walk among waterfall and hills.Nice climate and full greenery
2,Full greenery place,Araku valley a huge beauty of nature. You can get the taste of araku catch kirondul passenger train at 6.50am from vishakhapattanam station. The vistadome coach is a better option otherwise another coach get down boraguhalu station 10.30am.Take a cab visit borraguha and other points of araku came araku station at 3pm catch down Kiron full passenger to came vishakhapattanam. But my opinion stay at araku one night teast bamboo chicken and next day morning the same kirondul passenger to jagdalpur. It was a lifetime experience. Stay night at araku. Next day morn take a car to visit the beautiful chitakote falls thirathgarh falls kutumsar cave.
3,A serene and quaint place.,"Ideal place to take rest, for honeymoon, to enjoy the valley everything. Signature dish is Bamboo Chicken. Don't miss it. Quite, peaceful place to visit must. You should be there at least for two nights otherwise you can't enjoy Aarakku."
4,Good but below expectations,"Simple hill station with great attractions.Tribal museum, botanical garden,water fall(chapa rayi), coffee plantations and very famous Borra caves are worth visiting. Try bamboo chicken(tribal dish)"
5,Take Kirandul Express and buy the Executive coach tickets,Most beautiful places in AP. The greenery around and the gati roads are cool. Best part is the droplets of rain falling and having a coffee on the way

15,Good in its own way,"The valley is clean and calm with options like coffee museum, tribal museum and a few waterfalls that one can enjoy. This trip is though not that exciting for kids as they cannot really enjoy such places. You don’t get much options for food on your trip as you will only find some fairly good restaurants.

Have a waterfall, good valleys, fruit gardens,coffee plantation and more over a serene climate. Pollution free and must visit in the glass train from Vizag.Journey is too good."
25,Not at all worthy,One should visit such site seeing place. Both sides mountain and u enjoy the serpentine hourly passing through the valley. Stop at view points see the scenic beauty take snaps make memorable. Heart throbbing journey to reach the height. Should visit. Temperature varies.

28,Andhra khandala,Visit this place in winter by car. As you swirl around the ghat roads during cold days the flowers and aesthetic beauty of the place is going to amaze you. Must visit place at Visakhapatnam.

33,super it is very intresting place,Visited by hired car. Train has no AC coach. So winter preferable. Good landscaped flower garden. An old sculpture garden.
34,Journey a bliss,yes its called valley of nature because you can see every end of nature. different culture of people and their habitat. never  miss the train journey through caves and be careful
35,Heaven on earth,Araku is a place to relax and enjoy nature. There are few tourist spots in Araku and they can be visited in two hours time. If you have time you can go ahead upto 15 KM to Chaparai to see the water passing over rocky slopes. If you are at Araku then you must see Borra caves.
36,Beautiful hill station,"Arakku Valley per say is quite a scenic piece of hills with colours of red, yellow and green hues. We took the Vistadome Train and loved the journey through 160 tunnels and 3 hrs from Vizag. However, we had a tough return journey as the train takes its own time to return and stops at every small station. Other trains are given preference over this one.The tribal museum is a must see and so are the tiny waterfalls around the place"
37,Hill station,Beautiful scenic beauty. a bit colder as compared to vizag city. a perfect picture of valley. must stay atleast for a day. surrounded with tribal people. staying at haritha mayuri resort of aptdc will be a good choice though the service of this resort is simply horrible but the view from here is wonderful.
38,Must Visit,"Returning from Bora caves we enjoyed the beauty of Araku Valley. Do not compare this valley with major hill station, but it has some own beauty. Good place to stay sometimes and some good views for photography."
39,queen of hills of Andhra....,I think only in rainy season one may enjoy the scenic beauty since in summer and other seasons its not pleasant
40,Coffee Growing Area near Vizag,"Whike the uphill to Arakku valley is scenic & lush green, there is nothing virtually up the hill to see.Triba musuem upkeep is ok but the real life like statues exhibiting the tribal way of living is worth an appreciation.The padma park is like any othet hill park. Notning unique.Government hotel Haritha food was good the day we had our lunch.Otherwise many small & roadsidr options for food. No major food chain with presence"
41,What a drive ...,Araku is famous for coffee plantation & bamboo chicken. In my opinion October  to February is the best time to visit araku. Plz bargain with auto wala & hotel. I like tribal village museum there. Best place to go.
42,Araku valley the beauty of nature,"Araku Valley is the high point of a vacation in the lap of nature.The Araku valley on the Eastern Ghats,with thick forest on both side,is wonderful expirience"
43,Beautiful coffee plantations and pepper plantations at Ananthagiri,Good one must visit at Vizag! This Valley is famous for its train ride to its heights. The Valley looks beautiful with lush greenery on either side of the train track. The resorts or hotels welcome their guests with the Valley’s Tribal dancers. The Bamboo chicken is the a must try. The coffee is widely available here. Overall it’s a nice getaway.
44,vacation,"Such a nice place to stay at araku, around the valley is beautiful and fantastic places, we are excited with chapa Rai experience while diving in water, borra cave is marvelous"
45,Long winding journey,"Never would anyone imagine , Vizag the coastal beauty will house a beautiful mountain valley. Literally hidden, Aruku Valley is blissful and welcomes everyone with open alms. You have the Government run Haritha resorts (which is decent), there are other private hotels and guest houses. You can sit here and relax along the valley. Get a taste of the local music, dance and cuisine.  One is never tired of this place. The drive from Vizag to Aruku is roughly 3 hours, and is exciting as well. So go on, grab a 4 wheeler and wheel away ."
46,Araku,very very super it is interesting  and it is beautiful  and there is   borra caves on araku valley the borra caves is very beautiful and amazing I enjoyed very much super place i think everyone can visit it.
47,Family holidays,"it is the best place, must see even once in a year, Winter season it the best time to Visit, I will recommend you to prefer train journey from Vizag to Borra caves, you can feel wonder full experience. AP tourism provides best deals"
48,Picnic,Very spectacular train journey Not many options to stay Evening locals perform Dance Cross many tunnels
49,Nature's Beauty,"Taken a road trip to Araku valley in June, 2017. Enjoyed the ghat road driving, the panorama offered from the various view points and the fresh mountain air. we spend a night in Araku valley. A beautiful place to rewind and relax. Though the roads are narrow,they are in excellent condition. But be careful on the drive as  we have seen many reckless drivers who has never been to a ghat section and takes the bends at breakneck speed. Try the bamboo chicken, its delicious."
50,Heavenly Abode Araku Valley,A pleasant experience on the Hill meadows and nature. Can be planned for 2 days and 1 night kinda tour. Recommended stay at Mayuri - Haritha APTDC
51,Araku Valley,"It is a must see destination around vizag , quite peaceful and best time to visit is sept to Jan . It is best advised to stay at least 2-3 days for being able to enjoy the scenic beauty of the place !"
52,Good for overnight stay but don't have much attractions,Araku valley is a must visit.. very nice scenery.. amidst coffee plantations.. must try bamboo chicken when in Araku. A nice drive through the hills
53,Vizag to Araku valley,you can visit for  a picnic day with friends and family to enjoy the day. very fine views to enjoy the beauty of the nature.
54,A good valley,A place which you can choose only for relaxation and you must also  visit coffee place which gives you a feel of aroma that reveals the birth secret of coffee
55,Best hill station,This place is famous for the valley. This is a tourist attraction. The sunrise and sunset view is amazing.
56,Nice valley,"Nice place to visit in AP. Very close to Vizag and beautiful. Bora Caves are awesome. If in AP, must visit."
57,Nice,Araki valley is a good place to watch aruku train journey you can see their lot of things you enjoy it you can cover the hills locations by train and you will face the different experience than a normal train.
58,It's a hill station for people from south,"A must see natural beauty near crowded Vizag. Can go by train, a passenger which have  open glass couch, which you can enjoy the entire route with has 50+ tunnels, on the mountain tracks. We travelled by a cab though, from Vizag, booked from AP Tourism. Good experience. Besides Borra caves, the vally has nice places to see like tribal Exhibition, coffee process and can enjoy fresh coffee on the way too."
59,Trip to Araku Valley,"Nice views, quite beautiful. A ""must visit"" tourist spot. Drive in the valley is excellent. Local coffee is very good, a ""must have""."
60,Visit Only Borra Caves and Waterfall ,"araku is one of the best place. visit anthagiri coffee plantation and araku valley , araku museum, coffee museum ..."
61,Not a must see place,Nice visit  with  my 👪 and friends who are excited  and enjoyed everything  defenetly it  good hill view  spot.
62,Beautiful Place,One can see this valley as it is at a height where you can enjoy the cold weather and the view from the hotel.
63,Vizag and Araku surroundings,The very famous train journey to Araku is actually worth. The scenes are beautiful. The locals usually do a day trip to Borra caves. But a night stay in outskirts of the town is recommended. The bamboo chicken is a local delicacy. The coffee museum is also very cute and great place for evening hangout
64,Aruku Ooty of Andhra,"It is a hill station of the eastern ghats, where attractions like local tribes, coffee and tea plantations, tribal museum, coffee museum, Borra caves are here, the distance from Vizag is 120km the best part is the train route which passes through tunnels, hills, streams etc"
65,Nothing much to see,Good for train or car drive only. Best if you can spend a day in the pleasant weather. Avoid during hot season. Fricking hot in October.
66,nature trip from vizag to araku,Araku is popular for its coffee plantations. I have visited the lush green Ananthagiri Coffee Plantations on the hill slopes on the way to Borra Caves in  our day trip at Araku Valley and learned a lot about the coffee plantation. Local people sells coffee and local coffee power near the plantation area by the side of the road.
67,Boooooorrreee,"A very good place to enjoy with family and friends, it's like seeing north part of India when you visit this ace in winters, all the valleys covered fog it's a great view to watch can't explain in words"
68,Not quite as expected,Araku - Alternative to Ooty in Andhra Pradesh :)  Best visit time - All seasons but winters will be eyes feasting :) Places to visit --->Chaapa Rai Tribal Museum  Katiki Water Falls Tea estates Lambasinki Borra Caves Bamboo chicken must try dish :)
69,my aruku,Araku - Alternative to Ooty in Andhra Pradesh :)  Best visit time - All seasons but winters will be eyes feasting :) Places to visit --->Chaapa Rai Tribal Museum  Katiki Water Falls Tea estates Lambasinki Borra Caves Bamboo chicken must try dish :)
70,Araku Valley,"Very enjoyable trip up some curved mountain roads, but heavy traffic over the holidays. Love the climate and the beautiful views from the top. Lots to do and to discover!"
71,Peaceful atmosphere,"Absolutely fantastic experience of going through 52 tunnels from Vizag to Araku by train, breathtaking mountain view. We travelled by APTDC package to Araku & Bora caves, good arrangements except dirty railway coach. Nice trip with Bambu chicken, natural fruits & Araku coffee."
72,Araku valley site seen,visit the chill of andhra tribal areas by bike taxi too from one thousand onwards and good for singles and couples too
73,The best place to visit during winter season.,"Like: Nice valley. Dislike : All the greenaries are missing in april/may,visit will be best in rainy/monsoon time"
74,Waste of time ,"I felt the place similar to ooty, though it was wrong timing but we enjoyed Tribal museum and coffee plantation."
75,Poorly maintained.,"We been there several times. Untouch natural beautiful landscapes , coffe plantation and nice ambience temperature around the year clock. Nice place it is"
76,BESTPLACE TO VISIT IN WINTER TOO,"Lot of greenery but climate is not cool as need to be in a hill station. Personally feel not worth the money spent for a overnight stay. Nothing worth seeing also. Suggest take the train to & fro,  visit borra caves & go back to vizag for stay"
77,Stay at the lap of nature,We visited this place in the rainy season by crossing almost 40+ tunnels from Vizag through train. The lush green fields and the mountains all covered with greenery was a sight which was delight to the eyes. All the sightseeing places are worth visiting in this valley.
78,Araku Valley ,These  is the one of highest hills. And journey through  ghat roads. And Katiga water falls near by  .rose garden  coffee  plantations  deep forest and coolest temperature
79,Nice place.,"Araku valley has one of the beautiful mountain series of India, which are always green almost throughout of the year.we specially liked the traveling to Araku valley, with its raining continuously."
80,A teenager dream,Araku Valley is one of the main attractions if you are visiting Vizag. Keep one full day for the day trip to Araku Valley in an old fashioned way of Road Trip by Andhra Govt buses. Preferable time will be mild weather as the buses are non-AC. The trip take full day starting early morning around 7.30 till late evening. But the valley is a refreshing change from the usual city hustle and worth a trip!
81,Perfect weekend Gateway,"No Words to describe, its a must see location and especially during winters the chilling cold and bonfires are greatest combination to spend with family and friends. Bamboo chicken being one of the tastiest delicacies."
82,Long Drive ,Some distance away from the vizag city is this wonderful valley town. The valleys are lush green and gives a pleasent view. One should travel from vizag to aruku by train to get the flavour of the nature
83,Trip for relaxing ,"It is a great location with mountains and forests spread across 70km. The best way to enjoy this place is to go in train from vizag to araku, on this journey you can go through 40-50 tunnels dug through the mountains. You can see mountains , vast valleys and gorges.After train journey stay at a resort in Anantha Giri for a night to enjoy the peace and tranquility of the place. Do not expect tourist attractions here. I have also seen some camping sites .  You can then rent a car and go to tyda and stay for a night in the forest resort there. Which is pretty good by Indian standards. Location is just awesome . U should also take a hike behind the resort in tyda. I liked the views, and the flora and fauna on the trails.If you are adventurous , you should try a 9 km trek to the tribal villages. Remember it is 9km each way. So, start early if you want to complete it as a day trip. However , it would be more fun if you can backpack to the tribal village and stay there for the night. You got to understand this will be a primitive camping experience. On the way you can find a lot of edibles too.Caution: this is just my Idea for my next trip. There is no such organized trip. However, you can ask for a guide at the reception. I heard a lot about lambasinghi place. I guess it’s worth a try.Hope it helps. Please do share your experience of the backpacking trip."
84,Great to go,Was heartening to see that the government has taken steps to attract tourists with coffee museum and tribal museum. Good effort. Apart from that nothing exciting. A valley..yes. but not with a great view unless you stay away from the town. We had booked a hotel to stay for 1night but decided to head back to vizag.
85,Climate is not cool as need to be in a hill station. Not worth a visit,"Araku is best visited during October-January. Especially during month of Nov, all the terrain is covered with yellow flowers giving you breath taking scenaries. Train journey from Vizag to Araku is something you shouldn't miss to enjoy the beauty of Araku valley.Araku has steep valleys covered by fog, hills romancing the clouds is a visual treat!Borra caves, Ananthagiri Waterfalls, GaliKonda view point, Coffe plantations, Chaparai water stream are few of the worth visiting attractions along the way to Araku.Bamboo chicken and sweet corn made from local tribals are the delicacies you shouldn't miss!!"
86,Overall good ,"There is a wonderful entertainment at araku we have visited​ borra caves tyda waterfalls, ananthagiri waterfalls, sunkarametta church, chocolate musuem, padmapuram gardens,  chaparai,and anjoda trees"
87,Awesome Place,"A must visit place, i heard that we should visit this place especially in the months of october to january so visited in the month november.. weather was excellent enjoyed our trip to araku valley."
88,Celebrate marriage anniversary.,One of the best hill stations of South India. It offers nature's grandeur at its best.  One can enjoy Bamboo Chicken and Tribal dance here.
89,Nice place,If couples are planning go some place for enjoyment. Araku vally is good to visit. Enjoyed alot in Araku valley visit. Best time time visit araku is Dec-Jan winter season only....
90,must travel,"Araku it was excelent cool place, Climate, tunnels, Keuvs everything is good and most interensting train journey was good"
91,The Real CRUX of Araku Valley is only you can get by Train,"This is the best place to night camping.view is awsome , specially watching sunrise from the tent is speechless.you can also arrange your own bonfire and wine to make the night special.winter is the best season to go as weather is chill."
92,Scenic beauty,with peaceful and serene atmosphere  awayfrom city rush and pollution at about 180 km from vizag. good fora day can be reached by busby day package by ap tourism and by train journey through kirandol express starting from vizag station at 7.am.will experiences tunnels and steep bridges whole lot of new experience. with aroma of fresh coffee plantations on slopes of hills locks and the breeze of jungles.full of greenery and solace in the seasons (oct to feb).well the fresh coffe at road side and tribal musezeum gives insight of people living in rural areas. family and friends can visit this place only for daytour . we startedat 7 and reached there by11.00 am by road.
93,Wonderful Place.(Car travel suggested),One of the most visited valleys of South India is still very beautiful. Yes like most tourist attractions the Araku valley is getting a bit crowded. The coffee here is still considered the best. The best time to visit is winter months. There are plenty of places to stay. The popular bamboo cooked food is awesome. There is the tribal museum which depicts the life of the local tribes. Quite educative for morden times. It is about hundred kilometres from Vishakhapatnam and the are buses and private vehicles available to reach Araku. There is a train which takes you and brings you back to Vizag run by the Andra Pradesh tourism. So if you decide to visit Vizag don't miss the Araku valley.
94,Visit to Araku,Excellent place to enjoy holidays with family and friends. In Vizag it's is a great place.. Nice climate
95,A must visit hill station,"its a fantastic place to visit in summer,i enjoyed the place totally because we have some nearest visiting places those we can enjoy like water fals musium and some parks will be there.i enjoyed totally"
96,Awesome experience !!!,Araku vally is very beautifulwith trees and the hills are highly superb in the vally places are mind blowing for tourists
97,Never opt for vistadome from araku to vskp,"I went to araku few months ago cool place,I do like the atmosphere. It takes 2 days to see araku. Chepa rayi is one of the interesting place here we have a slant stone if we slide from the top we will fall into a small lake. Its very cool and safe either. Padmavathi gardens are full of roses when I visited. Burra caves are very interesting. Its makes us very exciting.. I loved it"
98,Araku by train !,"Araku  has the same climatic conditions and hill atmosphere nd is most selected destinations in Summar.... Due to its natural greenery and beautiful hills nd surrender by natural gardens and plantations, its choice of many throughout the year."
99,Mr Ravikanth ,"Araku valley is much touted as tourist attraction, couples with Borra caves. The last segment of the trip to Araku involves winding road up the hills to the Araku valley. This part of the journey is excellent . In the Araku valley itself, the only place to visit is the Tribal Museum where models depict the tribal way of life which can take about half an hour.The museum is a sprawling enclosure where a few shops sell artifacts."
100,Excellent,"I visited araku in dec'16, the peak season for winter coldness. This place started amazing everyone with the rail route it has with many tunnels . we started from vizag at 7 in the morning in train from vizag railway station. we reached araku valley around 12. Places to see in araku : Burra caves, Thatiguda waterfalls, Chaparai ."
101,Araku valley trip,"I visited Araku Valley to know more about Coffee and coco plantation. Yes, I learned lot more about coffee and most importantly how coffee came to Vizag area. Very interesting. I enjoyed a cup of Araku Valley Coffee and got few packets to take it home. More importantly, I am fascinated by the tribes living there. I have a feeling that they are part of the second migration from Africa several thousand years ago.  Archaeologists found in the nearby Borra caves tools used 40 ,000 years ago. I wish I can spend a week with the tribes to get to know them better. Still dreaming!"
102,Pleasant,Don’t waste much time in the valley area ! Better spend more time in caves and waterfall ! Trekking plus scenic beauty is covered ! Valley is more good in case u are staying around week else not much to explore
103,The Valley,Araku Valley is situated amidst the eastern ghats and is a popular travel destination. The journey is as beautiful as the valley itself. The place have a few view points and waterfalls. Nothing too great within Araku valley itself. Do try the Bamboo chicken if you are a non-vegetarian.
104,Relief from regular life tensions.,"It is a very good place, for weekend destination. Ideal time of visit is all round the year.Go with a train journey from Vizag and return with a road journey by car. Always a good scenic beauty . View point and shooting point are awesome on the way to ARAKKU.One can see Happy Valley coffee estate on the way and experience the magnificent test of the coffee.Araku is a small town with good and decent people. You can enjoy the town."
105,Never take evening 15.40 train from Araku to Vizag ,"It was an awesome place for camping near waterfalls,though there was less water.Pleasant weather & bit of cold.We were a group of 5 people including 2 ladies.Our host was very helping & informed us all things beforehand.To enjoy the best,reach the destination before 2 PM & set up tents before evening. Nice photogenic location.Only problem- No network. (May be a bliss too).Privacy is not a problem."
106,its no more andhra ooty,"If you want a long drive and beautiful scenic views from the best Andhra Pradesh has to offer in terms of its culture and landscape beauty, look no further.. the views are breathtaking for a great little day out (about 3 hours from Vishakhapatnam and back ). Would recommend this to anyone who is visiting the city for a day or 2 and would like to spend a leisurely drive up the hills or take the train for a fantastic and lazy ride up the hills with even more views (without the hassle of driving).."
107,Not worth,"Araku valley is a nice tourist destination near vizag. I have visited this wonderful place in April'16, with my family, in a day trip from vizag. We started from vizag at 7 in the morning in train from vizag railway station. We reached araku valley around 11:30 am. In our journey we cross many (more than 50) tunnels. In this trip we visited Padmapuram Gardens, Tribal Museum, Shooting Point, Galikonda View Point, Coffee Plantation and finaly Borra Caves. After visiting borra caves we returned back to vizag by train around 5 pm from borra guhalu railway station."
108,Switzerland of India.,"Just the way we north indians find all the beaches amazing, people from South find arrakku kind of place amazing, but it is not like shimla or kullu...But yes..good things about the place:1)temperature in jan was around 11 degree which was good...early Morning view was great.2) there is an awesome craft museum3) there is a small coffee museum4) u find coffee plantation on the way to arraku 5) u can visit borra caves on the way to arrakuThat's it."
109,araku very dirty,The place is good to have a weekend off from vizag. The roads through the rural areas and the hills makes it a good getaway.. borra hills on the way is a must visit..
110,Araku Valley,Everyone Wish is to visit their loved place This is the Top place in my list o visit this place Once a year for Sure this is the correct time to visit the atmosphere and the Nature will be awesome when You visit this place Between November to January.Coffee plantations and Cheprai waterfalls Tribal Museum and Coffee Museum is the beautiful place to visit in this location.
111,Cool,Akaru is good only between Oct to Feb.It has small attractions but nothing as compared to other hill stations. It is best for the overnight stay. Around evening time the hills start having fog. And it stays till morning. People go to the place to get experience of the same. There aren't much things for sight seeing except for Borra caves which is half way through the he hill.
112,hill station and valley,Araku valley is ooty of Andhra Pradesh.. Nice for holidays spending with friends and families... Good train journey to araku..from Vizag..we enjoyed a lot..in Araku..
113,Best Place to Visit near Vizag,"I had visit Araku valley in winter,we 7 friends were stayed at Rajadhani Hotel.very impress Hotel with beautiful  Valley view of Araku.most popular Hotel all cine actor,director and other teams are used to stay here on shooting times.Araku famous for Bamboo chicken.water falls are more attractive of Araku valley.The yellow Flowers and morning Sunrays are excellent for photography.I can suggest to visit in winter seasons."
114,Borra-Arakku tour,"It's a scenic place with a good weather most of the year except for the peak summer. Always had a good time.Be it driving around, walking,hiking or photography it's always a satisfying experience. The food is local and Chinese and there's a Araku valley coffee house which is impressive. Had amazing memories."
115,Holiday destination,"Araku Valley nestled in Eastern Ghat range, is an idyllic hill station, about 4 hours by road from Vizag City and about the same by train,which is Glass topped and gives a beautiful scenic panorama of the ghats.Its good to spend a night there so as to visit the Tribal museum, Botanical Gardens and of course, the coffee museum, which is a gourmet's delight and has a good museum too,chronicling the arrival of coffee in the world as well as in India. Ap torism rail cum road trip is decent, although the return journey by road is not as enjoyable as the onward journey by train, as the drivers of the buses tend to over speed. Overall, very relaxing place to wind down after a hectic week"
116,An erstwhile retreat that has lost its sheen due to overcrowding,"Very nice and peaceful place. However for staying, once can prefer Anatgiri which is little height as compared to Araku."
117,Weekend outing with friends,Every one knows about Araku ..such a beautiful place to visit I want to visit once again winter is most suitable season to visit
118,Araku Valley,"Visited Vizag, then went to Araku Valley, a hill station of Andhra Pradesh, surrounded by thick forests with greener, is close to Orissa Border. The area is developed as Coffee Plantation area by tribal farmers."
119,Vistadome Coach travel in araku valley,For bachelors its a nice place to go for trekking and camping. For families (especially with kids) it is more of a botheration. I saw many people vomiting because of mountain sickness on the way back and one day trip from Vizag sucks the energy out of you. There are not many places to visit except Borra caves and few waterfalls. The botanical garden and tribal musuem is not worth investing time.
120,Beautiful hill station of Andhra Pradesh,"we have hired a two wheeler (activa) from vizag and drove to araku valley. nature lovers definitely enjoy the route , the greenery and the turnings. Had yummy bamboo chicken and spicy  biryani in araku and visited padma garden which is not worthy to spend time.then proceeded to chaparai waterfalls , on the way we could see lands filled with 'valise'flowers which is really fantastic to see. people enjoyed water slide in chaparai waterfall though the water flow is not much. one can plan in November  to see complete valise flowers filled valley  which will be more beautiful.there are many trekking camps also on the way."
121,Awesome place,"Nice Valley , just couple of hours from Vizag , has a Tribal Museum n Coffee Museum and a Falls n a Garden , Road to the falls was bad coz of rains so didn't visit , Tribal Museum was good with pictures n their daily use articles on display , quiet a few shops selling all kinda stuff , slightly expensive but some things are worth it , Takes about an Hour to visit , a small artificial pond inside will take another additional half hour for boat ride."
122,ARAKU VALLEY,We stayed in AP tourism resorts. Location and view points from the resort were excellent. Weather was pleasant. Staff were very cordial and courteous. We enjoyed our stay.
123,Great trip,A truly heart filling destination worth going to atleast once in lifetime. The lush greenery and the untouched beauty of the hills is something that calls upon travellers to this wonderful destination. I visited almost all the places and tourist destinations in the Araku Valley. It was a truly wonderful experience. P.S. I went in the month of October last week.
124,Nice place,"The only tourist attraction in this place was fog in the morning. And if you are coming from a place in North India where fog is a common occurrence during the winters, this place will pale out in comparison. We did a night stay here and we regret it. You could do a one day trip from Visakhapatnam and cover this tiny valley and be back in time to sit in the beach."
125,Mesmerizing Valley,this place is very good after monsoon so that the falls have enough water. ananthgiri is a better place to stay rather than Araku if you have your own vehicle.
126,Avoid at all costs,"nice location , with cool climate . Araku is 90 km from vizag city and can be reached by car in 2 hrs."
127,Mersimerizing senic spots and good drive,The only good thing about Araku Valley is the Coffee Museum. The Coffee and the Bakery items that they serve inside are delicious and comparable to some of the best rated Bakeries in the metros. Their are only two Govt Hotels and both are in need of urgent repair and maintenance. But the food served at these hotels is the only saving grace.
128,Awesome place In South India,"Not a good spot to visit during summer (I travelled in April'17). Its too hot. Moreover the valley doesn't offer any spectacular view in summer as all leaves get dried up, there is no water in any of the falls, valley doesn't look green at all. However if someone visits during monsoon or spring, I think one would get a very nice view. Also, while travelling from Vishakhapatnam,, it better to travel by train. While returning to Vishakhapatnam, it is better to travel by Bus (takes approx. 2.5 Hrs) from Araku as train gets delayed almost everyday due to single Rly track."
129,One of the best attractions in Andhra Pradesh,"I like in Chandigarh, which is near to hills, I have heard alot online about this place, but was very disappointed to visit this place.  I will not recomend anyone to visit this place and waste time, there is nothing special in it, it is not clean at all, but there are Bora Bora Caves on the way which are very good."
130,Ooty of Andhra Pradesh.  A must to visit...,"Recommend traveling by train, it is a weekend trip from Vizag or Bangalore. There are thick coffee plantations on both sides of a winding road. There is also a tribal museum."
131,Camping near Ananthagiri waterfalls,Scenic journey. The place has a tribal museum and coffee museum. Ratings are based on the journey only...otherwise nothing much to visit
132,"""the best valley""","The place offers a good drive with mountain and valley views while Travelling to this place from  Vizag or Borra caves .It is about an hour drive from Borra caves or 3 hours drive from Vizag Though we only made a day trip from Vizag to see both Borra caves and Arakku Valley , one can think of staying overnight at Arakku for enjoying the weather .There is a tribal museum which is nicely put up , but its maintenance can be better considering a very good stream of visitors to this attraction every day . The entry ticket to this museum is Rs 40/- per adult .There is also a coffee museum operated by Private , which is good and an interesting place to see at a token entry ticket of just Rs10/- You can buy many varieties of premium coffee chocolates / dark chocolates / premium filter coffee . Enjoy a freshly brewed coffee sold at a reasonable price"
133,Mountains in midst of the Sea,"Araku valley, is one among the best of best Hill stations of India, though not promoted in line with Mussoorie and Simla or Ooty. One must taste Bamboo Chiken. Travel by train from Visakhapatnam to Araku passing thru Tunnels , one must experience."
134,Good drive through the coffee plantations,"It's sold in package by local transport providers, museums are useless, not a worthy visit.After visiting borra caves you can continue till coffee plantations, afterwards it doesn't worth at all. No good restaurants, even for kids museums are not interesting."
135,THE BEST VALLEY ,The weather in the afternoons is nice and cool in the late afternoon in Ananthagiri . I trekked in the coffee and pepper plantations . It was an amazing experience to trek on the slopes of the hills with such lovely weather and to escape from the heat and dust of the cities during summers
136,Araku valley,Take a toy train either way from vizag. Numerous tunnels and bends. Book from irctc before hand. Romantic. You can get down in borra cave stop and then take your car to borra cave.
137,A beautiful cave,Super flexible and essy way to travel and location is superb everything is quite good when compared to
138,Pleasant and relaxing day,For every student aur college guy is a dream to visit place to have a memory in life a very joyful place to go with friends
139,A very serene and calm place but not really meant for small children,it is the place in visakhapatnam to visit and enjoy the place where there is a excellent view of green  plants and trees.
140,Absolutely nothing to see,This is the must Visitable place in Andrapradesh which is a Awesome place with an awesome nature i wish no one will miss this place it's a kind of place that we think to visit.Go and Enjoy with Family and friends too.
141,Visit to Araku valley,"Araku valley also known as ooty of Andhra Pradesh is one of most scenic place near Vizag. Full taxi ride from Tyda to Araku was beautiful, greenery and the view of valley is very peaceful."
142,Arakku,"Situated in Andhra Pradesh it is one of the finest valley in India. one can see Coffee plantations on the way to Araku town. Surrounded with hills, beautiful waterfalls this valley attracts lakhs of tourists every year. Visit Borra caves, Coffee Museum, Padmapuram Botanical gardens to name a few."
143,Best in Winter season,"Visit to Araku by glass door train was an unforgettable experience .The green meadows swirling on my mind endlessly till date . I just loved the coffee museum,tribal museum and the botanical garden as well ."
144,One wonderful place,"The driving experience from Vizag to valley is the highlight of this destination not to mention the Borra caves. Valley as such is just about an average place with Tribal museum in particular offers a unique spectacle. The botanical garden, though not comparable to Ooty is a fair place to hang out."
145,"58 tunnels, 84 bridges - Welcome to Araku Valley",We travelled along hilly terrain all the way from Borra caves to Araku valley expecting beautiful topography and good sight seeing places. We were highly disappointed since we didn't find either of the 2. It's overhyped and best avoided.Would not recommend this place to anyone.
146,Need more maintenance,"More than visiting places, one should try to enjoy the beauty of the valley by going on a morning walk. The place is a good choice during vacations. When it comes to places to visit,1. Coffee museum(Don't forget to taste coffees and buy chocolates)2. Padmapuram Gardens3. Anantapur Coffee plantation4. View PointsThere's a train starting from Vizag to Arakku at morning. Take that, that must be your onward journey(Executive class with big special windows is recommended). While returning, take road(Don't take train just because it come late every time, actual arrival is around 15:00 but comes only after 17:00 often).Train journey will be unforgettable, will be a long lasting sweet memory.Rockk Inn darlings ...!! No second thought, not a bad option though better choices are available.My visit was during a summer, stayed there for 2 nights, mornings and afternoons were shiveringly cold, and afternoon, one out of three days it was slightly sunny. Other afternoons, there were drizzle.i'm attaching a pic of the beautiful Executive class I mentioned earler."
147,Very enjoyable trip if you like curvy mountain roads,"The train trip from Vizag to Araku valley was 5 hour long, but you can watch grand views. As you ride from Vizag to Araku , you get good views on the right side. Left side view is nothing special. Glass window is tainted or scarred, so you must find a clear spot to watch.Araku valley has a peaceful and soothing landscape with low mountains and fields. Coffee Museum was a nice surprise. You can drink and buy  quite tasty local coffee such as Peaberry and Araku Arabica."
148,Beautiful place,"It's 2-3 hrs drive out of Vizag, winding roads & greenery takes you to this little know hill station. Catch some good valley & hill views, do a trip to Borra caves, put your feet up & enjoy the good weather."
149,Valley,"the view and the driving experience is thrilling, recommend to self drive, its dangerous for self driving but you will find the view thrilling, its on the mountain top and while going uphill you will find some coffee shops please do try one of them, the people there grow this coffee and its one of the best in india, on top ie on araku you will find a coffee museum its awesome do visit it, you can find various hotel based on your budget but please at night when you drive on empty road turn your bike lights off and go star gazing it will be amazing , there are few places to roam at araku but i it is good for party people. ATM is available at araku and its a great place you can also visit by train"
150,Cool and scenic,3 things to enjoy here1. Borra Caves2. More than 50 tunnels you come across while travelling in train3. Bamboo Chicken
151,Beautiful mountains,"Two hours by road(we did not have time go by train)takes you to this scenic valley , the coffee region of andhra. The road through the hills is dotted with greenery, scenic interspersed with waterfalls( small detours  needed)and hairpin bends. If you are hooked to your camera you can make many a pitstop to satisfy your photographic instincts.Startout early in the morning with a stop for tea you can be in time for breakfast in arakku."
152,Awesome scenic picnic spot,I visited this place with my friends. It is soooooo beautiful and especially the way to reach this place is so good with bike ride.when you climb the clouds are under the feet of you. Its look like we are in sky. It is the paradise of the earth. Winter is the best time to visit
153,Hill Station of Andhra Pradesh,Visit this place  in march 2017 with family it was a pleasure to here for 1 day trip with ap tourism package  tribal musem and padmapuram botanical garden  ananthagiri coffee garden were worthy to visit
154,Beautiful drive to the hills !!!,The height and majesty of this hill is not comparable with other hill stations of India.The absolute greenery of this place is very special and may be unique. The train journey from Visakhapatnam to Araku is also very enjoyable. I advise visitors to travel by train to Araku at least for once. There are limited numbers of hotels in Araku and visitors are advised to book accommodation in advance.
155,Amazing Landscapes and Beautiful Mountains,"A beautiful hill station near vizag,nearly 110 kms from vizag city. Best place to stay and enjoy with friends and family members. Must visit place in winter.. Better to Avoid visiting in summer."
156,Must go,"Firstly, it is very far away from the city and easily takes 3-4 hours to reach. The views aren't as 'breathtaking' as some people have mentioned. I have seen much better valleys in India. The worst part was the littering that we saw throughout the trip on the roadside. The tourism department seriously needs to look into this."
157,Araku Valley Ballon festival - India s Switzerland ,"Spent two nights and three days at arakku valley. The beauty of this place is unparalleled. Since its a valley the temperature doesn't fall down to a great extent like the himalayan destinations, yet it gives the feeling of a himalayan tourist spot. Roads are beautiful winding through the hills. There are multiple sight seeing destinations like waterfalls, caves in and around araku. Take an auto rickshaw or hire a cab and enjoy the beauty of the place."
158,Araku,"The best way to go is the train which passes many tunnels. We have been here in bikes. Small hill station, bamboo chicken, tribal museum, coffee etc. If you are going with friends Try to go in winters and stay in tents then you can enjoy this place."
159,A great tourist destination ,"Even in the hot sultry June we enjoyed every bit of it. The tribal museum and botanical gardens are average, not that great. Definitely try the bamboo chicken and halwa. The coffee museum is too good. Lots of chocolates to buy and gift to people back home but not much options for gifting coffee which is actually more famous from Arakku. So that was disappointing. But overall a great experience."
160,Cool,We went in rail and this was amazing journey my family full thrilled and they want to go to araku yearly once
161,Awesome scenery,"Hello,I have visted Sraku valley in third week of July. Weather is very Pleasant.I Already visited lot of hill stations in India.Araku valley is different Since from train you get the crisp natural views which is not possible thru bus or cab.So best plan for Araku is hereGo by train in the morning at 6.50 am from vizag station.Also book AP tourism day trip to araku and catch there bus at Araku railway station.YOU will no miss any point, just in contact with bus incharge.see the pictures i have taen from my mobile thru train...."
162,The journey makes the destination look good,As a Journalist I travel the world but never knew such a beautiful place exist in India . Araku Valley is India ‘s Switzerland .. surrounded by green mountains filled with Sunflowers.. Came for Araku Balloon festival .. Stayed in a camp .. it was an experience to cherish .. Great efforts by AP Tourism to develop this ..worth a visit ..
163,Beautiful,Journey on vistadome coach was great.But the return journey was mared with unnecessary delay.The valley though is clean and beautiful.The coffee is best.You get the best organic food there.Excellent Spices and corn.Must visit.
164,Araku valley,"Araku Valley is one of the Best tourism place in Visakhapatnam who is want to goto the araku Valley go by the Train it is completely give fully enjoyment to all, in Train we can see the complete view of araku Valley in araku we can see yellow color flowers it is so beautiful."
165,In midst of mother nature,The Valley is a small village with minimum necessities available. We stayed at the APTDC resort.The valley has excellent scenic beauty. Tents are also available in the valley. The valley is famous for coffee and chocolates. Do not miss to visit the Araku Valley Coffee House. It offers a wide variety of coffee and chocolates.
166,Splendid place,"Have been several times to this place, recommend going on bikes, you will love the road trip. If you want to see caves etc while travel prefer train journey. Do not expect too much its just a valley far away from city you can have pleasant climate"
167,Attractive Aarakku.,"Firstly don't ever take autos,cars on rent on spot at railway station at Borra Caves/Araku/Vizag they bribing like anything.Ex: places like Galikonda view point,shooting point, Coffee plantation all are on the way from Borra caves to araku and nothing much interesting too but they will tell they will show these and ask for money these all waste.Place to see in vizag.RK BeachINS KURSURA (opens @2.30PM)Kailasgiri (view of coastal area and Vizag city)Beemli beachDolphin noseYarrada beachRushikonda beach (boat ridings)Don't visit kathaki falls.Go by bike from vizag to araku or go by train to enjoy tunnels and dense forest covered under fog.Visit Borra caves first then anantgiri falls then go-to araku and visit tribal museum and return to Vizag. Chaparai is one more place.Lambhasingh if you want to enjoy only for temperature (around 0 in winter season) nothing else."
168,Splendid araku Valley ,A lot of garbage and waste lying everywhere. Stinking of human dung everywhere. Roads are pathetic. Train always running late to and fro Vizag. Not recommended.
169,Araku,"I cant explain view of cage in words. Specially lighting of cage. Ram mandir also at the end of cage. They charge 60 INR for one person,50 INR for video camera and 25 INR for mobile."
170,Andhra ooty ,"The place was not as expected, since I have visited Oooty, Kodai,Munnar and others. But important for Andhra. Could have been developed and better clean place be given. The day before we visited,there was balloon festival . Has good number of Coffee plantations."
171,Deepest valley,"Araku valley is known as Andhra Ooty 😍 I was planning to go for araku since from my 10th standard like mostly from 8-10 years back but finally I got a chance to here twice in 2k17..one time with family and other with my friends..both the experience is good.First time visit : As my first visit is with my family,we started from Vizag railway station to borra caves and after borra caves we reach araku valley which is sooo beautiful with all the hill views and so greenary and Dimsa dance is the traditional dance here...araku valley has good cultivation area.and we stayed one night in araku valley coffee museum botanical garden and traible museum are the places to visit here.Second time visit : As we all are girls so we choose one day package for araku valley which covered all the above mentioned places..and it doesn’t cost much..as this trip is organised by A P tourism🙏🏻"
172,Arakku,"Not worth spending 6 hours from Vizag to and fro.,however tribal museum was only thing wirth seeing,h owover if u add Visit to Borra caves as well ,it becomes a meaningful visit"
173,One will fall in love with this place ,"If you are visiting Vizag, explore Araku Valley only by train. The route is scenic with over 50 tunnels.On return advisable to take a cab via Borra Caves.However cab is expensive, it will save time for your return back to Vizag."
174,Mesmerizing beauty,"Araku valley was a beautiful hill station located nearby Visakhapatnam city..The best way to go to Araku was by train through tunnels and bridges...As it was located in the eastern ghats at an altitude,the temperature was cool and surrounding were calm"
175,Lovely Place,"the village is dusty n hot.  there is no proper maintenance of roads.  though more than 3000 feet above Sea level, the hills are hot due to global warming.  no csre is taken to plant trees n looks baren.  not a place to visit in summmer anymore."
176,Nive visit,"excellent place..nothing much to see , rather its a place to enjoy the climate..its truly Andhra Kashmir..nice drive s, splendid seance views....hot coffee..very reasonable expenses . local tribal dance is worth watch...gardens are good"
177,Strictly during pleasant weather ,"Araku valley i one of the main attraction if you are visiting vizag. You can reach there either by a train, bus or private vehicle in rail route, you will cross many tunnels.and araku valley also know as ooty of andra pradesh"
178,so so,"araku for me is over rated. only good thung is bora caves and the journey from vizag to araku bu kirandul express. else its totally a boring place.  if u want to stay there, stay in jungle bell tyda not in araku."
179,Take a train,"I have visited araku valley last month. Its one of my best time because I have spent a very close relation with nature. The nature what you see is different from city to the araku valley. You cane see and sense the true color of nature there. I prefer araku, in andhra pradesh is the one of the best heritage places that we have to see and protect."
180,Just Excellent,"If you are looking to spend a quiet weekend in a calm and serene place and in midst of nature, this is the place. You would see a wonderful combination of the river, the waterfall, the hills and lots of greenery. Place is quiet and ideal if you wish to rest your mind"
181,A beautiful place which relaxes your mind,"Located 100km from Vizag, Araku valley offers beautiful views of the Anathgiri hills and coffee plantations. The valley is reached through a beautiful drive through the hills which offer breathtaking views. I would suggest going to the valley using the vista dome express which offers magnificent views of the valley."
182,Awesome climate,"it has just about nothing.wonder why people go there.the coffee plantations are  just a view from the car, the views of the valley are like so many others at hill stations and the small market that constitutes all there is to the town has nothing to offer.the tribal museum is boring. avoid unless necessary to tick off"
183,Pollution Free Journey,Good place to visit in Winter... We went in summer and still we could enjoy... we have couple of waterfalls with less water as it was summer.. but in season you can expect a good view of Araku...
184,My best time,"This place is a hilly region and has very good climate during the months of November, December and January. There are lot of places to stay there and you also have the facility to rent a tent and stay there. Renting a tent will be the perfect decision you can make to have a stay there because you can enjoy the nights really well. It also has several other attractions like Museum etc.Happy Travelling !!!Regards,Dinesh"
185,Must visit for nature lovers,Great weather I never saw this place in my life before. Show friends safe with your neighbours and never want to be great weather to watch
186,Araku trip,"Araku is a popular hill town (no, don't compare it with Darjeeling, Kodaikanal or Shimla!!) almost out of nowhere! The best way to travel to this place is to take the slow passenger train from Vizag in the early morning. If it is the busy tourist season, the train is likely to be filled with tourists from Bengal, some young honeymooners from Andhra, probably a group of college students in excursion and a large number of migrant from Odisha and Chhatisgarh going back to their home. The train passes through around 50 odd tunnels and reaches the highest point in Broad Gauge in India at Similiguda (the station just before Araku). The journey itself is rewarding. The road journey is equally nice and comfortable.In and around the town, you can visit a few Waterfalls (Chhaparai, Thadiguda), coffee plantations at Anantagiri, Tribal Museum, a large botanical garden and a well curated Coffee Museum. Besides, the famous Borra Caves, which is probably the largest cave is India, is one hour journey from the town and worth visiting.Like other hill towns, wake up early to see the 'sunrise', walk around to get the groove of the place, laze around and savour the unique local delicacy of 'bamboo chicken'. The chicken pieces are marinated and mixed with spices and put inside the hollow bamboos, which is then heated up on fire. The woody smell of the chicken is excellent and is available at the street corners. Overall, a nice place to be for a couple of days from the grind and monotony of urban life."
187,Visit to spend some relaxing time,One may return back from Bora caves if he is short of time. Views upto borra caves are also very good. There is nothing much to do there. Museum is worthless. All other attractions are so so. It's only if you stay overnight and treck and do other activities you may love that place.
188,My recent visit here,"Araku Valley is nothing to offer other than the train journey through the various tunnels and Borra Caves. People from outside Andra Pradesh may not find Arku Valley as an ""attraction"". Borra caves are a must to see. I recommend going by train and coming back by road/train. Just visit the Borra caves and come back."
189,Nothing much to see,"Araku Valley is an awesome place to visit. We booked our journey through APTDC and started from Visakhapatnam. 58 tunnels of different lengthsare the main attraction of the rail journey to visit Araku. If you are foody and love to taste different foods then you must try ""BAMBOO CHICKEN"". Its a delicious and spicy preparation by the locals. If you are visiting to Araku and reading my article then note it down as the 'must do' thing at Araku. I am sharing some pictures of the dish. Next you can visit the Tribal Museum. There you can found various tribal artifacts and hand made coffee. You can buy if you wish.After visiting the places you should have an experience with the tribals, performing DHIMSA. Dhimsa, a tribal dance form, is performed by the Porja caste women. A group of 15-20 women form a circle and dance praising the deity for the welfare of their domestic life. The female readers of the articles can take some steps along with them.Have a nice journey, friend! :)"
190,BORRA CAVES AND KUNTALA WATER FALLS,Another good place to visit in Visakhapatnam area. First of all travelling up the hill in itself is a great experience and then the beauty of the nature simply splendid. In araku we can visit the tribal museum and the garden plus the coffee museum.
191,valley of nature,"The way to arakku is beautiful, we went by scooter from vyzag,so that we can enjoy the scenery.on the valley coffee house is real worth..we went on October so weather was hot little bit.you can visit one botanical garden and a tribal museum there but not worth..return journey we visited bites caves and was good..have water falls along the way and we visited one and that was good..must visit the coffee museum and enjoy a cup of coffee and chocolate.."
192,Scenic trip near Vizag,"I am going to aruku by trine and enjoy to my wife and train going way was nice, every one enjoy this place of visit ."
193,A sight for sore eyes,"Araku is simply undefinable in words we visited in the month of may it's simply superb and it assures a great time for family , friends and for ur loved ones but going to araku on bikes is the best idea as u can explore so many things the locations are very nice and u just can't ignore the location without having a selfie or a group photo . It's not that if u don't have bike u cannot enjoy the araku valley if u travel by train it's also superb the tunnels and the locations  outside are also superb ."
194,beautiful and scenic view on the way to Araku,The journey to Araku by train will give an awesome experience. One can take the kirandoul express from Vizag which starts at 6.50AM in morning. It passes through several bridges and tunnels and it gives a thrilling experience. The view of the surrounding hills and lust green vegetation will be a rewarding experience for a traveller and photographer.
195,An excellent trip into the lap of nature with APTDC,"We reach the cave by hiring a cab. Very beautiful cave I never seen before. Inside the cave ups and down, stares are there to climb, very nice lighting. But for elderly people this cave is slightly tougher."
196,Beautiful place ,"This is the one of the most favorable and loving place to see the fogg ,The best moment in my life is visiting araku valley ,I suggest all of you to visit this place,This is the best place to enjoy with friends and family .I become memorable moments everone's after visiting araku valley"
197,Excellent Place to Rejuvenate near to Vizag,"Araku Valley is one of the best valley of Eastern Ghats, which is 111 km away from Vishakhapatnam city. The Anathagiri and sukarimetta forest are part of Araku Valley. Araku Valley trip will be amazing trip as this valley surrounded by high Mountains, foggy clouds, lush green forests and pleasant climate There is train service also available from Vishakhapatnam, which is running between Vishakhapatnam to Araku and one has to get down at Borra Guhalu Station. This train will go through 58 Tunnels.Bongulo chicken is one which is famous here. All Non Vegetarians want to have once in a life this bongulo chicken. Don't miss it in your next tripBest time to visit is November to MarchNear By Attractions:	1. Borra Caves	2. Katiki Water Falls	3. Galikonda View point	4. Araku Tribal Museum	5. Araku Coffee Museum	6. Kothapally waterfalls	7. Chaparai falls	8. Padmapuram Gardens"
198,nice hill  station near beach,"No doubt, it is one of the best places to visit with your squad. To experience the beauty of Araku do visit during the months of nov, dec, and January. Every year there will be parachute festival being celebrated during the months of December and January."
199,Hill town ,Wowwww...it was so fresh without any pollution...mornings were too cold and enjoyed a lot...Very good view points and coffee plantations were awesome..and roads curves greenery and all were awesome...young couple don’t ever miss this place...
200,Fabulous,"Ananthagiri is a pretty good destination. It presents an excellent view amidst hills. From Ananthagiri on the road to Araku you get to visit Coffee Plantations, Coffee Museum, Tribal Museum and Padmapuram Gardens. Each one is excellent in it's own capacity and provides a great experience for nature lovers."
201,mind blowing vally,Araku Valley is located about 110 kms from Vizag. One can do this journey in a day and be back by evening at Vizag. The valley itself is very scenic with coffe plantations and a very well maintained tribal museum.
202,Bad experience ,"Araku Valley is a hill station and valley region in the state of andhra pradesh. The atmosphere is very peaceful and pleasant. Bamboo chicken is the most popular dish here. The tribal arts are very famous here. It is having flower, fruit and vegetable gardens.It is also known as Ooty of andhra."
203,Auspicious location ,"The drive from Visakhapatnam is very interesting. The climb up the hills offers great views, and the side trip to Borra caves is well worth taking. Arukan Valley is itself a bit disappointing when you get there, but overall it is a great excursion."
204,Araku  valley  good place,"if you are visiting in summer, it is not at all best time for visit this but you can give a shot, just like I did. we visited Araku and Bora from Vizag with AP tourism. it was nice trip, the plan was executed very successfully. Araku valley was not so beautiful as it supposed to be in Winter but it was a good view from the view point."
205,Good place to visit,"Araku vally was only hill station in Andhra Pradesh maintained well, but now it's not looking good, only Tribal museum is good, worst maintenance of Botanical garden, no water in Thatiguda water falls, Chaparai  water falls also not good"
206,Superb hill station,"Despite ontward journey from vskp to araku was incredible,the return journey was terrible.The train reached araku 2hrs late following to that the train stopped at simahchalam north for more than 2hrs which is of no use.When we interacted with station official they informed us that an Express train as left vizianagaram and they have sided our train to clear the main line.Just imagine to reach simhachalam it would take around 1hr and putting us on the loop line is completely baseless .Shelling out 650rs for each seat just to experience the breathtaking beauty of nature had put us in vain.There were many kids and aged people travelling along which had caused them immense trouble. I urge people to avoid this distress.East coastal railway division plan on the movement of trains seems to be completely unorganised and disastrous."
207,Sunday at Araku Valley,Just to make it clear as per my understanding about this place..Araku valley is a place name located in valley so do not get confused about valley or caves availability in this location.. drive through this place is really good.. awesome scenic places and awesome greenery all the way..drivers should be a bit careful while driving on this track..some handful numbers of waterfalls available once you reach this place and most of them are decent... Do visit to explore more about this place..
208,India's most one of the beautiful place in aruku velly,"A beautiful hill station and a must to visit during Vizag trip. Vizag to Kirandul passenger  leaves Vizag by 6:50 AM. You can book a seat in the newly introduced Vistadome coach from the IRCTC site, seat type mentioned as EC@ Rs. 650 approx.If that seat is not available book ordinary chair car. Window seat gives good view of the journey path. Take note, only BSNL and Airtel mobile connections works properly in Araku specially near the Borra caves. Araku station to hotel taxi fare is Rs 100/- to 200/- approx. Local sight seeing including Borra caves in car costs about 2200 INR.Don't miss locally prepared  chicken kebab & boiled corn in Gali Konda View Point.As per the driver Hot Air Ballooning has started in Araku from last year at the month of November. As it is a hill station, temperature falls sharply at night during winter months and might touch 0' C at night during December. Winter garments advised. Araku to Vizag by road also offers scenic view and costs about 3200 INR without AC. Road is good and spiraling nature offers exotic view of the hills and valleys. Credit card generally not accepted. For more adventurous types Tent on Rent is available though not very much suitable for ladies."
209,Araku has become hot and greenery is vanishing,i went to araku valley this year it was an amazing feeling at the place it feels heaven when you go through roads in mountains and there is one place called bora cave its a must visit if u go andhara pradesh and they are many more wonderful places within 10 km the only disadvantage is that there is no good restraunts so have your meal before going there or take food with you
210,Scenic beauty of the place is breath taking,"We have seen many such hilly terrain. It was a great ride. Road is sooo good! But nothing beyond that. If you have prior experience of hilly ride, this is just an average place. However, enroute to Araku is where Borra Caves is. That's a must see. So you cannot avoid Araku."
211,Enchanting valley in Eastern Ghats,"Visited the caves during the long weekend 14-16 January so was prepared for huge crowds at the spot. The train journey from Visakapatanam ( recommended , by visakapatanam kirandul passenger ) to Borra Guhalu station took more than three hours through more than twenty tunnels and views of the valley. Our vehicle was waiting at the Borra station but it due to haphazard parking at the station it took more than half an hour to get out of the station. About five minutes drive from the station , we encountered another traffic jam so got out of the vehicle and walked to the entrance of the caves which took less than ten minutes. With only two persons manning the ticket counter , it took more than half an hour of waiting under the sun to get the tickets ( Rs 60/- per adult and 25/- Rs per cell phone) . Spent less than one hour . Very beautiful large and deep cave (80 m) ( deepest in india) of karstic limestone, used by the local tribes as a place of worship. One can see lot of irregular shaped stalactites and stalagmites .Walking shoes, camera and cap is a must. Involves lot of walking on steps up and down but can be done at a slow pace.Bamboo chicken ( chicken cooked over charcoal by stuffing it in bamboo shoot , an oil free and nutritionally rich dish )was being sold all along the way to the caves.Simple lunch is available in hotels nearbyDriving back to vizag through Araku valley in the eastern ghats was a pleasant experience through coffee plantations, waterfalls . An enjoyable day long trip ."
212,Hill Station of Eastern Ghat,"For the coffee plantation? not worth it.for the views? you have seen one hill station you have seen them all.for what else? no idea.After a long drive you land up at  small street market where your driver tells you this was araku valley anf you wonder what this was all about. Avoid , unless you want to stay at one of the numerous resorts ( Andhra tourism ones are the best) which offer peace and solitude.,"
213,Quiet and Serene Valleys,Araku valley should have been maintained in its original pristine beauty.  It is grossly commercialised
214,Nice place to visit Araku,Its 120 km from vishkapatanam. Train travelling istrillingone .bamboo chicken is available her cost of 130 rs for 350 gm and 250 rs for 500 gm.bottanical garden tribunal museum and coffee museumin arakku valley.
215,Coffee plantations,The kashmir of Visakhapatnam..U can feel here like hill station... It will take 4-5 hours journey by car from Visakhapatnam. U may also by train from Visakhapatnam city..
216,Cool Place,An overhyped place. No more the place I visited 10 years ago. Lots of commercial establishments. No tourist attraction spots. Not worth the 3hr journey from Vizag.
217,Tourist spot,Araku valley is a beautiful destination for a couple of days. It was a part of our itinerary along with Visakhapatnam. We booked a cab from MakeMyTrip. The cab took 3 hours from vizag to araku. The way itself is very beautiful with meandering roads along the hills and innumerable waterfalls all along the way. Greenery is everywhere and its such a bliss to the eye. Truly wonderful!
218,"Spectacular views everywhere, Nature at its best","Best season is sure the period between Nov-Jan. This time chose road journey and after Sringavarapu kota( S Kota), the Ghat section starts. Me and my wife ( i am a senior citizen and she --just a matter of three years) set off to this exciting journey on a cab. On way, had breakfast at an eatery NEAR TAGARAPU VALASA, beyond Vijayanagara. Lovely place and decent food. The first one we visited is the TATIPUDI RESERVOIR, which quenches the thirst of Visakha janta.A picturesque place and unfortunate not to have full capacity for a boat ride.ARAKU, No longer is a valley. Heavy commercialisation. However, do visit the waterfalls at CHAAPARAI( A big Boulder looking like a mat) and KATIKA JALAPAATAMU( WATERFALL). Chaparai is easy to approach. However, KATIKA is far off( about 10 km)on a rugged road from BORRA GUHALAU( Caves). The journey can be performed in a Commander Jeep only( DO NOT VENTURE EVEN WITH YOUR OWN SUV's, however rugged they are). The Jeep drops you at a palce and from that place one need to do a quite ardous journey, climibing lot of jagged roads( a misnomer of a road). At the summit, one can see the waterfall...Though nothing much to write home about, nonetheless, for an adventure freak, its fine. I am aged 61 and my wife 56 , yet sheer grit and determination made us climb( with lot of difficulty, thou) almost to the summit. Few youngsters advised us not to go beyond. Better try in the monsoon season, where the risks will be doubled and adventure will be manifold. Please book your tickets in advance on the aptourism website for a decent accomodation at ARAKU. Next day, we set out for LAMMASINGHI( Called as LAMBASINGHI).It is between NARSIPATNAM( VISAKHA DT) AND SILERU( Visakha patnam) . We could not see snowfall, as the season is almost over. Other wise lovely palce. Start off at 3 A.M.( YOU HEARD ME CORRECTLY) from VSKP and reach LAMMASINGI by 7 A.M. Lovely sunrise and simply loose your way walking on the ghat road.Enjoy the tour. Take adequate water, biscuits... Good veg tiffins are available at CHINTAPALLI.. Bye for now"
219,Vacation,"If you are planning for a good peaceful holiday, Araku is the best. But November to January is the best time for visit."
220,Boring 3 hour drive from Vizag,Don't ever think to visit araku vally by rail. Most hopeless Indian railways services run ever seen.
221,Train through Tunnels and Borra Caves,"About 130 km from Visag. Easily reachable either by road or by train. Only one passenger train having 2AC also leaving Vizag in the morning at about 7.00 am and reaches at about 11.15 am. The best place to stay is APTDC Haritha hotel. All arrangements are available there. one can visit Tribal museum & coffee museum even by walk from the above hotel. Other places like Chaparal water fall, Padmapuram garden can also be visited. Every day after lunch there is also tribal dance programme."
222,Scenic journey,"Nice place but involves lots of travelling. You can get down at either arruku valley or near borra caves station. get private vehicle, they take a group of 9 to 10 at once for visit.You can visit waterfalls, coffee park sceneries from the top."
223,Beautiful valley,"Nothing much to see in that place except the tribal museum. It is better to plan a trip to Borra Caves which is much lesser in distance from vishakapatnam. If u r a traveller from Mumbai , Mumbai-Lonavla travel is much more interesting but considering Vizag it is a gud drive much better to take the 630 train to Araku /Borra cave station and drive back to vishakapatnam"
224,Still Underdeveloped and at-least needs a couple of more years to reach any of the other Hill Station potential,"the atmosphere,climate and the whole experience was really nice.first of all the travel for this place was amazing by passing through so many rocks and green fields and dens."
225,Better than Kulu Manali or best among  Hill stations of India,Getting closer to nature: We have hired Dezire for Rs 3000 both ways. But return we have chosen Glass Train which was waste of bucks as it delayed by 4 hours.
226,Good place to enjoy with family and friends,Recently visited Arraku it was not so good experience. May be it was our wrong plan. We made biggest mistake of getting down at bora caves thinking that we will share car from caves to Arraku with decent price but noooo private taxi and auto were so bad they started bulling us and not letting others to take us to Arraku Vally. At last we shared a auto in 250 per person till Arakku with all side seeing. So best is to get down at Arraku station and then book a car or auto 😱😱😱
227,Summer camp,"While in Vizag one need to take 01 day off to this beautiful location which is approx 140 Kms from Visakhapatnam. Covered with green cover and coffee plantation. This valley offers you more... fresh air, waterfalls and stream close by and peace."
228,Picnic at araku ,"We stayed here for 2 nights during our visit in Araku. We stayed in the craft village. The weather was nice, bit cooling. The entire resort was surrounded by hills."
229,Very good and Excelent place near at Vizag,"Thanks to Indian Railways for launching Vistadome Coach in Araku valley route.  The coach was superb, we were among the early bird tourist to experience it.  The kids enjoyed it a lot -esp 360 degree rotation of your seat and the views outside.  we went in the month of May, but recommended travel period is from Oct to Dec where the valley will be full of yellow flowers.  We just had a greenery view of the valley in May.  However, be prepared for the late departure and arrival of the Train from Vizag (Vistadome coach) during to heavy train traffic in that route.  Dont plan any connecting trains/air from vizag when you come back as it may get delayed. Plan for sufficient time gap.  We can buy snacks, coffee etc, on board. Onward to Arakku is more recommended than the return as our train got delayed and there was darkness outside"
230,unforgettable pleasure!,"i went by road. a pleasant drive but i m sure the trip by train would be more beautiful especially in the monsoons. the place is just about okay. nothing much to write home about. coonoor, ooty , munnar are more beautiful. but once youve gone there , a visit to the coffee museum and the tribal museum are in order."
231,Good one to visit,"It was really an awesome trip we had. I have been planning for Araku trip since my college days and finally it happen now along with my 2 years old kid :). Really enjoyed alot places in n arround Araku. We visited following places: tribal museum, coffee museum, Borra caves, 🏇 ride for my son @ Brindavan gardens (we didn't entered into garden due to time constraint) but my son enjoyed the horse ride. Finally katiki waterfalls with thrilling zeep ride n then hill climbing we enjoyed alot. You need bit of guts n stamina to reach there to enjoy the beauty of the nature."
232,Breathtaking views & must visit place,"In Araku valley nothing much to see. One tribal musuem is just plain farse,more of a shopping place rather then a musuem and badly maintened,and one coffee musuem where no one will tell you about anything about coffee ,it's only a selling point of coffee products .Both places have entry tickets which is not justified. Better to see Borra caves and return back to Vizag instead of coming to Araku valley. I would had utilised this time to see other attractions near Borra caves if I had any clue about this place ."
233,Simple and serene,"I have been to this place with my family and the weather at this place is awesome, the best time to visit this place would be after rains.One should definitely visit Bora Caves when they are in Araku and should definitely try the bamboo chicken."
234,araku valley,"A train ride away from the city of Visakhapatnam this is a beautiful hill station located on the Eastern Ghats. The train ride is really beautiful offering beautiful views of the Ghats. Though neither as tall  or lush as the Western Ghats, the eastern ghats have some beautiful waterfalls, coffee plantation (located around Araku) and the famous bora caves. Romantic and not so touristy."
235,Good Relaxation during Summer,"Before visiting araku Valley please check the weather, otherwise it will be a complete mess. We stayed there for 2 days, hot, humid specially day time, you have to keep the AC on. Nothing much to see, well coffee museum and tribal museum are the two most visited one. On the way to Araku, Burraha Caves is a must visit place"
236,o.k for long drive,if u want complete peace and enjoy the beauty of nature at the best i would suggest u must visit atleast once
237,Scintillating,Train journey to Araku valley is exemplary. Try your best to get into train at least one way. It passes through 38 tunnels and many pleasant views. Araku as a place don't offer much to spend time. However you can relax in nature's silence.
238,Don't visit during summer,"Araku valley is nearly 110-5 Kms. from Vizag[Visakhapatnam] and can be conveniently reached by 58101 Kirandaul Passenger which leaves Vizag at 06:50 Hrs. and reaches around 10:50Hrs. Situated at an altitude of ~3,100 ft. on the Eastern Ghats is full of greenery and natural beauty. Visit Padmapur Horticulture Garden. For coffee lovers it has a unique museum which will take you to a journey of coffee history, cultivation, seed varieties and coffee making methods and related aspects. Bring back coffee powders/chocolates as per your choice. Amazing varieties of locally made chocolates are tasty to suit every taste buds.Visit the tribal museum and get an insight to the tribal life as prevalent in Andhra Pradesh. Watch and dance to the tune of traditional folk music and dance especially ‘Dhimsa’.Chicken Kebab cooked in bamboo tubes are unique for this region and most sought after non-vegetarian dish. Pure vegetarian foods are difficult to find. Best vegetarian breakfast option is available from 6AM from an eatery run by an elderly couple from their home."
239,a good place to see after monsoon,"We have visited Araku valley in Aug 2017. We went via train to Araku from vizag ealry morning and reached the resort called Dhimsa Resorts. Since it was raining heavily we were unable to move out until afternoon. As soon as thr rain stopped we headed out looking for bamboo chicken which is quite famous over there.. As expected the taste was delicious and mouth watering. We also visited few other places like the chaprai waterfalls, view points, museum and the famous borra caves.Overall out experience was delightful and were most excited at each and every point in the whole trip"
240,A day trip,"If you are in Araku Valley, the only way to get a feel of the beauty of this place is from the APTDC's resort that is perched on a hilltop. Rest of the area is dingy and dirty."
241,Araku Valley,Araku valley is not much far away from Visakhapatnam ...one finds no difficult to reach there ..I recommend train journey since it offers much fun...Araku valley has many attractions to watch and have fun...especially burra cave ....and the best time is winter season to visit
242,Long Drive,"The train ride to Araku valley is a must for anyone visiting to Vishakhapatnam as a tourist. The train to Araku showcases some of the most breathtaking view you might have ever seen. The train passes through Shalmiguda also which was the first highest broad gauge station. After reaching Araku you should visit tribal museum. The manequins placed there are a complete look-alike of real human beings. I didnt find the botanical garden much intersting except its entrance. Take a trip back to vizag by car so that you may visit other places in Araku as well as can visit Borra caves, Golikondalu view point & coffee black pepper tree plantations on the way.Note: Be careful while buying natural coffee beans/powders at Araku. The powder we bought wasn't found to be natural after opening. You should reach station really early to catch the train to Araku as there is heavy rush to catch this early morning train."
243,Sightseeing sight,Nothing much to see. JUst a same day touring from Vizag. Good restaurants are very scarce so plan ahead in advance.
244,Nice place to visit in Winter,"Araku is the Best Place to rejuvenate for a day or two if you are in Vizag. Araku is always cooler than Vizag and Fresh Air,  Greenary, and journey to Aruku by train will be a memorable experience. Don't expect very good food at anywhere in Araku. It's just a feast for eyes not for tummy."
245,Post monsoon/ winter is best time,"Overall,it was a nice place to visit with my child.Some places like the museum was pretty horrible place but it was OK considering the amenities provided.Would suggest everyone to go there if you are visiting Visakhapatnam."
246,Beautiful Location ,"This is the one of the most favourable and loving place to see the fogg,the best moments of my life visiting araku valley.i suggest all of you visit this place"
247,Great Drive and View's,"From Visakhapatnam go by train,  @ 40 tunnels on the way, broad gauge with electificaton, araku is @ 920 meters from msl i. e.  Mean sea level means @ 3000 feet,  memorable train journey,  botanical Garden, borra caves, tribal museum, are main attractions,  stay for a night and enjoy fog early in morning, local people are too cooperative,  food and Accomodation is best,  bargain for local transport, best and clean hill station, newly married couples must visit Araku"
248,Happy to stay ,"Araku valley is a hill station which is around 110 km from Vizag. You can reach there either by a train, bus or you can go there by your own vehicle also. It is a very nice place to visit, gives you beautiful scenic views. It is a valley in the eastern ghats inhabited by different tribes. You can also see the coffee plantations there."
249,Simply beautiful.,"We took a biking trip from Vizag to Araku in December, 2016. I have heard that the train ride is beautiful, I have not been on it, but I can certify that the road trip is no less. It was an amazing experience, passing through lush green mountains and valleys, rivers and brooks along the way.There are pit stops along the way where you can indulge in some kebab or bamboo chicken served on the roadside for dirt cheap prices.The ride into Araku is excellent, while the valley itself is a little underwhelming. Maybe it was because of winter, but everything was dry and quiet. There is not much to do in the name of activity, so you can check out some waterfalls and the Borra Caves along the way.Araku is a quiet town, with little in the name of shops of sights, or even places to eat for that matter and it would be best to chose a nice resort and stick to activities within.However, I would recommend this trip for the road trip alone, the roads are in good condition and navigation is not difficult, google maps is pretty accurate, and just enjoy the sights and sounds along the way."
250,Araku,The place is a hill station.There are APTDC full day busses which start in the morning from vizag and leave you back in the night.Its a place to go with kids.Therz a tribal museum and park.Kids enjoy a lot.
251,araku was one of the place,Not advisable of visit araku in the month of Feb.Best month for visit is Dec&Jan.Exept climate no other worth seeing places are at araku.
252,near by hide out for people from vizag,"In my view, the place is publicized in undeserving eulogies. The journey by Vizag - Kirandul Express in its only vistadome coach was pleasant. As we got off at Araku and came out of the station building, repulsive smells and dirt hit us. And so was the town with its dingy bazar and crowd. Visited Chaparai Waterfalls that is maintained (!!) by APTDC. Got into an enclosed area, paying an entry fee of Rs 15 per head, and the sight shocked. Garbage was found littered around. The Coffee Museum too wasn't that attractive. Araku Tribal Museum appeared to be a misnomer. Padmapuran Botanical Garden does not deserve much acclamation. What we fondly remember was the view of the Nilgiris, the silent and comforting greenery, from the balcony of our hotel."
253,👪 good  stay,"An awesome adventure to visit this place, lot more to do. I traveled in January 2018, And I felt awesome with the natural view."
254,"Lovely landscapes, worth visit",This is hill station in the tribal region of Andra. It can be reached by train or car from Vizag. The scenery on the way is very good. This is the coffee plantation area of Andra.
255,Excellent View in the midst of Hills and Valley,"we stayed at the Haritha Hill Resort of APTDC at Araku Valley for two nights. And it was a memorable experience which I would cherish for long.Nested within the hills of Eastern Ghats inhabited by different tribes, the stay was calm and serene.The resort as well as the surrounding was like a picture post card.Though there is a problem of mobile network within the campus of the resort but it acted as a boon for us. enjoyed the non connectivity with the rest of the world and spent the time through fun filled activities ."
256,Nice view,"Araku valley is quite close to Visakhapatnam and very easily accessible both by train and road. APTDC has a day trip from Visakhapatnam. One way train journey is a must with train passing through number of small and big tunnels which in itself is fun filled journey. Araku valley has many attractions to watch and have fun especially Borra Caves, tribal museum, some gardens, etc. Winter is the best time to visit Araku Valley."
257,Araku ,"Araku valley is a hill station close to Vizag in Andhra Pradesh. Though not comparable to other hill stations of south India like Ooty and Kodaikanal, it is a good  option to cover if you are visiting Vizag along with Borra caves. There are some beautiful sunset views of Paddy fields in the Araku valley hills worth a visit."
258,SCENIC,"If you have visited all renowned hill stations of India, than it will be a waste of time to visit here. However Bora Caves are on the way to Araku, visit Bora Caves and come back to vizag. Bora caves are worth seeing.Visit Araku only if you have nothing else to do and have ample time. There is nothing to see much."
259,Araku Valley - Beautiful green picturesque landscape,It was 0°degrees temperature there....but really awesome tour...compulsory visit this place dont skip this place
260,Coffee Plantations – The place at Araku Valley for coffee lovers,"For ppl getting bored at Vizag and feeling the rush to drive, this is one of the best option; just 120 km from the City.Suggest to visit in the winter times; though called a Hill station, summers are pretty hot and none would feel to roam around under the sun."
261,araku valley EXCELLANT,"actually it was our bad luck as our flight got delayed so we reached late n it started raining & even the Hritha Mayuri Resort where our stay was booked grippling with power failure with all dark, quite a nightmare indeed ! we're compelled to shift to their other Haritha resort in the midst of night, with dirtiness all around, Food facilities especially for PURE VEG travellers in virtually absent-had a lot of difficulty"
262,A valley in the tribal region of Andra,We had a very pleasant and relaxing day touring the Araku valley and was great to get out of the city and see some country side for a change.The valley allows for some wonderful scenery with plenty of stops for photos and time to explore the surrounding area.A great place to share with a friend.
263,Arku valley visit,If you are planning to go to Araku valley from Vizag on a one day trip then take care of these things. Start your journey early in the morning (you can take ola cabs). First go to Borra caves so that you reach by 10 am (opening time).You will cover it by 12 noon. I didn't go to Kaitli falls we had to cover extra 7 km. Other fall nearby which falls on the way to araku valley was not worth a visit.   Araku valley is another 40 km away. On the way u will see Golkonda point? and coffee plantation. Both can be skipped to save time. In araku valley you can see botanical garden which has a toy train and can see triabal museum. Overall araku valley is an overrated place. You get tired by the end of the day. Best part of araku is the bamboo chicken.
264,A day in NATURE's heart,"Complete disappointment. Badly maintained. None of the sites are worth taking the trouble.  Except for the drive from Visakhapatnam, there is not much to see or do. Bad hotels / lack of food options / unclean eating jointsIf you have been to similar places like Coorg, this will compare very poorly. If coming from Vizag, do not go beyond Borra Caves."
265,A beautiful place,"This is one of the most hyped places where tourists, particularly from West Bengal, throng like crazy people. Shabbily maintained Padmavati Garden and the Tribal museum shows the apathy from Tourism department. Only place worth visiting is the Cofee shop and Borra caves. Rather Borra caves is a must visit. The train ride is worth a try. One should visit only in winter. Summer is horrible. November 1st and 2nd weeks are the best when the valley is covered with many patches of Niger seed flowers."
266,An Average place ,"Araku Vally is a four hours hilly drive from Visakhapatnam and a nice tourist destination, There are some beautiful resorts of AP tourism with basic amenities"
267,nice to visit,"Along with the beauty of Araku, I'd suggest, you can also enjoy the Journey. Consider taking train to go there and I bet, you'd enjoy the journey if you can manage to get a window seat. While returning, consider taking a bus and you can discover a different path! This is only a suggestion and not a standard or guide. While in Arakku, I'd suggest, if your budget permits, hire a cab to visit all the places around. Happy journey!"
268,Not so great,It's good for a 1 day trip. You can travel from vizag in about 3 hours.Enroute you can visit Borra caves. In araku apart from the scenic beauty on road there ain't much to see. You can visit the museum and coffee museum. These are the major attraction on reaching there and that would be all.
269,Amazing Araku Valley,"I have been to this place earlier in mid October and loved the day trip. April is not a good time to visit araku valley as it is hot and humid, a long tiring journey from Visakhapatnam and not much green. Waterfalls were also dry."
270,Good place to visit,One should visit Araku valley if at all they decides to stay at Vishakhapatnam...scenic beauty and lush green hills .. cooperative tribals and we can also buy their products ...one can also visit the museums here and on the way can visit various waterfalls
271,a days trip from vizag,"Araku valley is located in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. People can visit Borra Caves, Ananthagiri waterfalls, Coffee Museum. And ofcourse Foodies can taste a tribal people cooking Bamboo Chicken. This will be very delicious. Can go and visit coffee plantations."
272,Not so exciting,The location was beautiful mind-blowing and can't describe it words. I haven't seen such a place ever before Glad to see that Enjoyed a lot with my family there And the way people worship lord was fantastic Little bit scared while entering the caves There was a beautiful scenery and which made us so happy
273,Day Trip!,This is the third time I had been to varaku valley.every time I visited  I feel more excited as the view and locations were simply awesome
274,Great experience at araku,"I booked a local cab in Vizag, and headed to Araku at 6 am.. approx 2 hour ride plus a tea stop.. our planned itenery included Borra caves, a waterfall, bamboo chicken, araku coffee, ghat views and tribal museum.. Borra caves are awesome, except for the heavy saturday traffic.. The scenery is heavenly with yellow flowers covering the valley... Must try the bamboo chicken.. approx 250 rupees for half a kilo.. Araku coffee is refreshing.. The tribal museum is a no-no, as it is not well maintained and didn't seem interesting"
275,ARAKU VALLEY-A Misnomer?,"It wasnt a planned trip,however it went well all because of mother nature, the whole trip was so amazing, araku valley is a great place, greenery takes its all charm,if you are nature lover this is the place to visit, in the closest vincity of nearest town vishakapatnam it can be easily accesed by road,if you choose bikes to travel much better because the whole travel by road is so scenic that you dont want to miss the beauty of the nature,stop at some tea stall in between have hot sip of tea makes you feel like heaven in great weather,if you are lucky you might get to see some movie shooting , we got to see one movie shoot,over the trip we have enjoyed have to play in small waterfalls as well,"
276,"Lots of view point, coffee park, and water falls. Nice Place","I would suggest to reach this place by Train from Vishakapatnam.Although the train takes almost 4/ 5 hours to reach there, it is quite worth it. It travels through tunnels even as long as 712m ( which i noticed in board). Eventhough it is hot in afternoon, you would enjoy the climate during night and early morning. It was cloudy when we were there, but it didnt rain. Nearest attractions were Coffee museum, Tribal museum and some waterfalls. Best season would be between November and February."
277,Excellent,"I went in the month of December, 2016, to Visakhapatnam. And araku valley happened to me. Green, Beautiful picturesque landscape. Peace and serenity. With waterfalls and green mountains, one must, must taste the coffee here. Do visit the Katiki waterfalls. Its a beautiful trek up the waterfall and once you are there 'Heaven' is word."
278,"Amzing place, greenry, best coffee ever!!","Araku valley is a valley located in Eastern Ghats and politically it falls in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The area is mostly forested. Araku valley has the Bora caves which spreads in a large area. The forests here are Anantagiri and Sunkarimetta Reserved Forest. Apart from naturally growing trees in forest, Araku valley has man made greenery in the form of Coffee estates, jack fruit, mango and banana plantations."
279,Amazing train jourmey through tunnels,"I have visited some good hill places and probably that's the reason I am putting it as average but frankly speaking it's a valley and not much scope of very good scenic beauty. On the way you can visit Borra cave, coffee garden, coffee museum and tribal museum and also some small waterfall. Also botanical garden is there. There are some view points which gives a nice view."
280,very nice place for coffe lovers and party lovers,"At least an overnight visit is required to somewhat appreciate the place. But I will not be surprised if I find people staying for a week and not wanting to go back. The beauty of Araku is still pristine, though the market area has become congested since we last visited,  and that was some 14 years ago.We visited this time in August -- even though Vizag was hot and humid, Araku was magnificently pleasant. We were welcomed by a marvellous shower of rain as we alighted the train, leaving us drenched but yearning for more.The hills and the greenery were a joy to behold. The tufty clouds nestled in the crevices that the hills provided. The sight was heavenly.We left within 24 hours. Thoroughly unsatisfied and with a promise to come again."
281,"relax, relax and relax.....","I went from Visakhapatnam by Kirandul passenger. I got down at Borragruhalu station. Went to visit Borra caves, a natural cave, superb and a very special experience. Borra caves is within a walking distance from Borragruhalu station.From there, I went to Araku by road. It took approximately 1 hour to reach Araku. A very nice and cool place. There are water slopes, water falls, tribal museum, coffee house having different varieties of coffee, even you can see how they are grinding coffee, full coffee making process is being demonstrated.You can eat bamboo chicken, a speciality of these place at water slopes Chaprai and enjoy the place far away from the crowd.Overall, it is a very good experience and nice place to visit if you are coming to Visakhapatnam."
282,Beautiful vallies,"If you don’t have time, you can very well skip this place after visiting Borra caves. The valley does not offer any breathtaking scenes except it has a tribal museum and a coffee museum. Though the coffee museum is well maintained, a visit to tribal museum is a waste of time. In case you plan to drive till the valley, there is an AP rest house and restaurant near the museums that serves buffet lunch."

284,Don't miss coffee museum ,"It's just jaw dropping. I mean woah! It's too cold and steep so do be careful. Araku is located at 18.3333°N 82.8667°E.[2] It has an average elevation of 911 metres (2,989 ft).It is located 114 km from Visakhapatnam, close to the Odisha state border.

285,why go there,"We paid 665 per ticket. Train started at 17.40 instead of 15.40. 2 hours late. When we went and compained, we got weird response that there is only 1 track. Further, they gave way to 2 goods train and no green signal for this train till 17.40. The whole purpose of this train is the journey through Borra Caves and Tunnels. We missed everything. We left our hotel room and were waiting in railway station from 14.20pm only to realise that this train is always late. Please don't do the mistake of taking this train. Train was so slow and we reached at night 23.30pm. So much of inconvenience and worth 0 stars.Note: Instead prefer morning train from Vizag to Araku and please book tickets very well in advance as morning train is difficult to get"
286,why go here?,"We planned to stay two days at Araku but had to abandon our plans on the second morning due to 48-hour bundh called by Araku Girijana Sangham on 06 Jan 2020.We booked exactly 3 months early to travel by AC Tourist car in Vizag-Kirandul Express. The AC coach (the last bogie in the train)  has huge glass windows, making one close to nature. 36 of us travelling in that coach - singing & dancing and enjoying the hills & forest was a memorable experience.Nothing to write about Araku valley as such except for a few tourist attractions. We could cover Borra caves, Padmapuram Gardens & Tribal Museum. Borra caves are good for checking your physical fitness & tribal museum for shopping & boating.Non-vegetarians can try the local bamboo chicken sold all over."
287,Ooty of Andhra ,"Board on Kirundul passenger at 6.50 AM at Vizag,get down at BORRA GUHALU stn.at 9.45AM.The charming train journey almost ends there by passing through  huge number of tunnels,sharp bends,hill to hill transfer.Borra to Arakku is some extension of the same route.If permit, book Vistadome coach's ticket costs Rs-655,otherwise book ordinary reservation and try to seat at right side.All the views comes through right side mostly.After getting down at BORRA GUHALU take an auto to BORRA CAVE,just 2KM away from station.Enjoy the oldest and stunning cave.Its really nice creature of nature.Enjoy BAMBOO CHICKEN's fabulous test here.Return Vizag by evening return train which really saves cost otherwise take car and back at the cost around Rs1800-2000/car.AP TOURISM conducts package tour from Vizag to Arakku and back at cost around Rs-900/-per head.They arrange by Vistadome train coach onwards journey,sight seen at Arakku tribal museum,Botanical garden,coffe plantation,borra cave by bus,lunch at their Harita restaurant and shows an extra ordinary DIMSA tribal dance in it.My opinion either go by AP TOURISM PACKAGE,or by own go up to BORRA and back.Arakku has nothing significant to visit spending extra Rs 1000-2500.by personal car.Its beauty is just hill roads ups and downs and curves.Thanks."
288,Queen of scenic view ,It was a little inconvenient to visit here but the relaxation overpowered it. It's a good spot to spend time and have food. Must visit in monsoon or Autumn.
289,Overrated,"If u hv seen the Nilgiris then u knw wat to expect. But if u hv never been to that side of the world, the journey from Vizag to Araku is simply out of the world. A few pointers for the 1st timers. Make sure you book the tickets in Executive coach at least 4 months in advance. The demand is unimaginable and u will knw y once u experience it. There is only one vistadome coach. The train journey is amazing and the train slows down quite a bit so u cn enjoy every moment of it. So it wud b worth ur while to plan a nyt stay at Araku especially if u r a 1st time visitor."
290,A day trip to Araku,"The train is the best way to get here. Difficult to get seats though. Not too much to do; it is a chilled out place. Don't expect great food and be warned it is very touristy. All said and done, it's unspoilt, great views, scenery and a quiet place overall"
291,Not so important. Although stunning views,It is near about 130 km from Visakhapatnam city. It is around 1000 mtr. above sea level. It is a beautiful valley. The journey by train from Visakhapatnam to Araku is enjoyable. The train goes through number of tunnels and bridge in the valley. The famous bamboo chicken you can test here. You can see Borra Caves here. Suggest to go their in winter.
292,"Borra caves, Araku valley",Wow andhra ooty .....The name exactly opt for this place.....The train route is marvellous through tunnels and mountain edges..... Best time to visit this place is during the end of rainy season and from december to february
293,"Araku valley is average ""see""",Aaraku is must from Vizag.... Beautiful.... Fresh air.... Uff.... Must see.. Beautiful scenes and roads by car..  Beautiful tunnel in train.... Various site scenes in araku... Tribal museum... Padpuram garden... Borra caves...  Anantgiri falls... Katiki falls... Chaprai falls.... Can go to jagadhal from araku... By travelling around 298 km. Various view points on the way.. And troops of monkeys too...
294,Quiet and Quaint ,Araku valley is at a distance of about 120 kms from Visakhapatnam. 3hrs drive. The drive is beautiful. After about an hour its all ghat road. Lots of twists and turns. And a lots of monkeys on the road. Be careful with that. On the way there 2-3 beautiful valley view points. Nice points for a quick stop over and a few pics. You will cross the Ananthgiri coffee plantation. Also if time you can a have a few small diversions for waterfalls. All the points a very weel marked. So you wont miss any. Araku valley os positioned as a hill station. Its a very small place. Just has a small valley. But its very calm and peaceful. The morning view of the valley with fog covered makes it a pleasant view. There is not much to see. The tribal museum is good to spend some time. Just an exhibition to showcase the tribal life. A coffee museum is a safe skip. However it does serve very good coffee. In Araku the must try dish is Bamboo Chicken. A chicken dish prepared in bamboo staff without using oil. Its good to taste. Overall a neat visit.
295,Beautiful cage of Araku vally,"We went to Aruku in the month of May, which may not the right time. It was bit hot and dry. Still, the drive was good and the ghats section made it bit live. There were some veiw points on the way from where we can have the wonderful veiw of the valley. On the way we can try bamboo chiken, which is prepared by locals and worth trying it. One can find local people selling honey and coffee powder. Aruku has some coffee plantations and one can try these products. Once we reached Aruku, it was a small town and the location is good. There is a tribal exhibition and one can learn about the tribal life style and methods used by them. There are various stall set up and different kind of products hand made tribals are sold. We were told by our cab driver that tge peak season is winter, but we observed that not much of hotels or resorts were there on the valley. We were told that, most of the people plan for a day trip from vizag in the peak season. Since the rush will be high at that time, traffic jams and high costs for food, cabs etc have to be taken into consederation. We were told that during winter the whole valley will be cover by yellow flowers which is the main attraction of the valley. This valley is famous for film shootings. Overall, its a good experience."
296,Tonic-Valley,"At the end of a long and tedious journey you arrive at a place similar to what you've seeing out of the window throughout the day. Nothing else to see, nothing else to do. You feel you've been taken for a ride."
297,Quaint and undiscovered holiday destination,"At a distance of 112 km from Vizag, 432 km from Vijayawada, 85 km from Vizianagaram, 26 km from Anantagiri and 635 km from Hyderabad, Araku Valley, popularly known as Araku, is a scenic hill station in the Vishakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. Often referred to as Andhra Ooty,"
298,Araku-the scenic beauty,"If you are in Visakhapatnam, don't miss out on going here. Take the train and go through the numerous tunnels along the way. The way to Araku is the best. The actual city Araku does not have much to offer except good weather."
299,"Too much of hype, good only in winter.","Araku Valley is a hill station in Visakhapatnam district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is a valley in the Eastern Ghats inhabited by different tribes. The Anantagiri and Sunkarimetta Reserved Forest, which are part of Araku Valley, are rich in biodiversity and are mined for bauxite Galikonda hill rising to a height of 5,000 feet is amongst the highest peaks in Andhra Pradesh. Araku is blessed with enchanting beauty of the hills and greenery, interspersed with streams and rivulets.
