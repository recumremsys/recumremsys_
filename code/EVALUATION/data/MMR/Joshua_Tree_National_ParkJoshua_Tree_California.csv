0,Joshua Tree Park is a gem,Beautiful and vast national park.  Felt like I was in the Flintstones with the jumbo rock formations.  Joshua Trees are unique and cool.  Cholla Cactus garden and Barker Dam hikes easy for all levels and amazing. Keys at sunset is the best.  Park is magical at twilight.
1,Amazing surreal experience ,"Well spent day. Incredible rock formations, pictoresque Joshua trees. Visited in November and was still quite hot. Snacks, sunscreen and water supplies are must.  Can´t imagine visit in real summertime."
2,Spectacular ,Loved this Park.  Everywhere you look a new Scenic View.  Must sees are the Cactus Gardens and the Rock Formation all over the Park.  Joshua Trees everywhere so get lots of pictures because you find these anywhere in the US.  Rangers do a great job keeping this Park pristine.
3,Watch Out For the Bees,A unique environmental park in the desert lands of California. Beautiful rock formations and a Mecca for rock climbing.We visited in June and the weather was warm to hot in the day and cool at night....perfect blue skies. It can get very hot later in summer. The information centre at the turnoff to the par in Joshua Tree  has loads of maps and advice plus environmental information. Lots of camping sites but bring water and everything you need.I will return to spend more time here.
4,Beautiful in Every Single Way,I enjoyed Joshua Tree National Park more than I even expected. Unique beauty. We did the Baker Dam trail and it was fantastic. We will certainly return.
5,Epic Beauty - JTNP,Spent NWD with extended family at Joshua Tree. Snow all over which added to the surrealities of the park. The Joshua trees were amazing and coupled with some unique rock climbing; we had an incredible day and look forward to going back.
6,Interesting Experience with Unique Scenery,"Joshua tree vegetation merges with the desert landscape, Huge stone architecture, carved by nature. Beautiful cactus flowers"
7,Interesting Desert Experience,I love this Desert park! It offers a bus into the park from Joshua tree or twenty nine palms. This Desert park has large boulders which are used for rock Climbing!  Camp grounds and hiking trails abound! Please make sure you have adequate supplies of water and food! A beautiful park when the desert has cooler weather!
8,Joshua Tree at night ,"We came three days, visited Barker Dam, Hidden Valley, cap rock, geology road tour. Otherworldly rocks, some of the oldest on Earth in the road tour. Fantastic animals and plants. Will camp next time."
9,Well appointed Visitors Center,"The lanscape is beautiful and very special. It looks almost prehistoric with the strange Joshua trees, cactuses, plants and boulders."
10,Joshua Tree National Park 2020,"Stunning.  Completely unexpected.  The cactus blooming are beautiful and the ability to park overnight to see stars make this one of the best all day trips near Palm Desert.  The rock formations, every few miles you come upon a new and more wonderful view.  Perfect for kids and families to see the true wonder of the world."
11,Hiking outing,"Lovely scenic national park to hike on the various trails.  Lots of lookout stops to take pictures.  A tip, make sure you go very early so you can see a lot of the park and have time to hike on a couple trails.  The Cottonwood Spring Trail and the Lost Palms Oasis Trail were great and very scenic. The Cholla Cactus Garden, White Tank and Hidden Valley were amazing to see.The staff at the Cottonwood Visitor Centre were very helpful.  We’ll be back again!"
12,"Very big,very awesome.",Beautiful park with amazing scenery. Drove from the west side to 29 Palm on the East. Great Junior Park Ranger activity badge for kids to complete - pick up at the visitor centre.
13,"Amazing, just go!","I’ve never scene a place quite like Joshua Tree National Park. An expansive park with trails aplenty and different options for hikers of all levels. Easy hikes from established parking lots and starting points. Predictably hot in August, so make sure you’re prepared with fluids and food. Also prepare to have no cell service!"
14,Earthquake rumblings in a desert of unsurpassed beauty,"This is an amazing park that I totally recommended visiting! Amazing sunset, beautiful nature. At night we were watching the stars, a lots of shooting stars on the sky, just beautiful!"
15,Joshua Tree National Park is Open Again!,"I really enjoyed the 3 days I hiked and explored the park. Split Rock, Skull Rock. Cholla Cactus Garden and Keys View are must see! The hiking is wonderful. I went up Ryan's Mountain which is a very well maintained trail with amazing views!"
16,Hiking,Awesomely cool national desert park to drive around in. Lots of photo ops. likely over one hundred good trails for hiking.
17,"As with all National Parks, you'll be glad you saw it for yourself.  And no, it's not just trees!","Such a unique and special place, amazing raw natural beauty.  We learned so much about desert life.  The pictures don’t do it justice.  There are plenty of fun activities for all skill and activity levels.  Go and see it for yourself."
18,Desert paradise,"Joshua Tree National Park is a landscape out of Dr Seuss, with magically twisted trees, cacti and stacks of boulders. It is gorgeous at sunrise and sunset, for hikers and tourists alike.There are bathroom facilities that are very basic, but drinking water is non existent, and you must bring sufficient water (and then some) with you, and on trails.I recommend the Wall Street Mill Trail for those looking for a gentle hike  at 2 miles long, over fairly flat, but sandy ground, it is a relatively straightforward walk with things to see. Again - bring plenty of water with you as there is little shade and you will feel the exposure."
19,Plenty of Nice Scenery,"We had wonderful vacation in Palm Springs and Joshua Tree National Park. It’s desert landscape but is really and amazingly beautiful. The boulder filled bare mountains, stretches of land filled with cacti, the elegant Joshua Trees make the experience totally unique."
20,Incredible place,"Beautiful trails and beautiful national parking for hiking. Had an amazing, relaxing day with my buddies"
21,Wonderful Park,"Spectacular scenery, stunning vistas, informative rangers;  everything you want in a park.  A must for a Palm Springs trip.  Keys View was well worth the drive to get there.  We entered via 29 Palms and exited via Cottonwood.  It was a beautiful drive and we were lucky to view a “superbloom” of desert flowers after a rainy winter.  Took a very informative ranger walk at Cap Rock, too."
22,Crowded ,"Took our 2 young daughters while on holiday in Palm Springs.Amazing geology and wildlife. Took a drive around the park after visiting the information centre. Our daughters loved doing the free activity book, spotting wildlife, plants, trees, cactus and learning more. We parked up several times and walked around. While it is well visited we never bumped into many other people. There were lots of Jack rabbits and squirrels and hundreds of tarantula burrows everywhere!On the way home we visited the Cotton Woods visited centre and our daughters handed in their completed activity book and became junior rangers, they absolutely loved it. We also learned the history of the geology which was really interesting. Definately worth a visit. We returned on another visit to see the dark skies, had a fab view of the mikly way, wish I had a better camera!!"
23,Great place for adventurous kids.,"Beautiful scenery and very different than any other parks we’ve visited. Most enjoyed Hidden Valley, Keys View and Cholla Cactus."
24,Must see SoCal area,"A pretty neat park, the trees are amazing and the rock formations are awesome. We have visited most of our National Parks. Each one is special. I can’t say this park is one of my top 10, but it is unique and worth a visit. There was a lot of road construction during our visit, but you just need to call ahead and schedule your time in the park to include upkeep of the park. Also take time to tour the visitors center, they will give you maps and information about the history of the park and the Joshua Trees."
25,Wonderful trails,"We were blown away by the vegetation and the rock formations. Don’t miss the cactus garden or Barker Dam. We went up to Key View and were excited to see the San Andreas fault, but the wind was too strong and cold (late December) that we didn’t stay. Indian cove was interesting as well."
26,Beautiful,Beautiful vistas. So much more than I expected. You never get tired of seeing rocks and Joshua trees.  Make sure you hike around and over the boulders. If you use the twenty nine palms entrance there’s no lines and the visitor center is nicer and less crowded than the one in Joshua Tree.
27,Must see!,Nice drive in the Joshua Three National Park. The nature looks amazing in spring time. The entrance was free.
28,Very enjoyable,"Absolutely loved watching my kids dash to the top of the boulder formations.  2 days was great, would have loved even more time here!"
29,Very Interesting!,Joshua Tree National Park is miss named. The real stars are the massive rock formations throughout the park. The namesake Joshua Trees are kind of scrubby looking things that actually detract from the landscape. This is a once is enough park.
30,Fill up your gas tank before going to Joshua National Park,Great boondocking spots off I-10 before park entrance. Quiet. Great Star gazing! We will be back soon.
31,Joshua Tree National Park,"Outstanding day spent in the enormous park, with memories made to last. We started at the Cottonwood Visitor Center in the south of the park  and followed the route which a very knowledgeable and professional Park Ranger mapped out for us to cover the most in the one day we had for a visit. You can't really and fully appreciate this park in one day, but here are our highlights: the Cottonwoods Springs path, the Cholla Cactus Garden, the Jumbo Rocks/Skull Rock, the Barker Dam hike, petroglyphs and of course the Joshua Trees, also fondly known as the Truffula Trees (with a tip of the hat to Dr. Seuss and the Lorax). In one word: fantastic! The desert was blooming when we visited, the carpet of multicolored flowers an amazing sight in itself. The photo ops are magnificent. A word to explorers of the park - a sedan is fine for most paved roads, but if you want to truly explore, get a four-wheel drive, the dirt roads are spectacular. And if possible, go back as often as you can."
32,Nice day trip,Loved this park. The trees are amazing! Went hiking with the kids and the visitor center was helpful in determining which trails to check out to see the best sites and weren't too crazy for us not so fit bunch hehe.
33,Hike (Carefully) Among Rock Formations,Great family trip with beautiful scenery from Keys View. Must see at sunset.  Can drive all the way to it.  Fun for all ages!!
34,Jaw dropping scenery!,"I had an amazing time around park and its surrounding. It looks like you're inside a movie, every single aspect of the different scenery this park has is just breathtaking and full of history behind. Make sure to bring with you plenty of water and comfortable clothes to spend a nice time inside the park!"
35,Unforgettable ,A great national park with the trees and cacti varieties to see. The joshua trees were in bloom and there were a great variety of wild flowers in full bloom. Great time of year to visit with great mild temperature.
36,Not to miss,Beautiful national park. The vegetation and rock formations are awe inspiring. We visited during the government shutdown and are thankful to the officials who kept it open despite the shutdown so e could enjoy the park. Perhaps the shutdown was also the reason why we felt we didn't have enough information to truly explore the park since there were no rangers to ask questions to. We didn't have cell phone service in the park so couldn't look up anything online as well. The signage at the park is insufficient to guide visitors. For e.g. the main road in the park called Park Blvd. branches out into other roads that we could see on GPS but we didn't know what was on those roads and whether or not it would be worth taking them.
37,So much to see!,"Must see National Park!  Looked like God decided to have a rain storm of rocks and boulders.  As they clustered around the park in amazing formations, hills and mixed in with the beauty of the desert gardens.  Who know cactus could be so unique and beautiful"
38,Very neat place,"Beautiful park, awesome chollas and Joshua trees but don’t come through the south entrance and expect to see the awesome right away. You have to dive in about 45 minutes before the cactus and Joshua trees appear."
39,Outstanding National Park,"Joshua Tree Park is a most diverse place of organic boulders, nature paths, cacti gardens, textured landscapes and of course Joshua Trees that look like something out of a Dr.. Seuss book.  I’ve actually visited the park three times in the last 3 months. January and March experienced light snow which added interest interest to the scenery. February weather was a bright sunny day with blue skies. It is quite beautiful when there’s no one else around - where you can enjoy the solitude of the nature.There are two visitor centers at different ends of the park. We personally prefer the cotton wood entrance.  The main roads are well paved and the dirt secondary roads were fine even though we didn’t have 4 wheel drive. Speed levels are slow so animals are protected and you can travel and see the sights.  If you plan on returning multiple times then you may want to consider the different passes which are offered. I have a senior’s pass with no expiration that allows the driver and 3 passengers free entry. This pass is good at any US National Park. You don’t have to show the pass upon entry, but when exiting you do have to show the pass and another piece of secondary ID. It’s all based on the honour system.On the days when it snowed the night before there was traffic. It was congested on the weekend at the entrances and no line ups during the week. On the sunny weekday there was very little traffic. Overall this national park has well designated, natural settings with small parking lots. Campgrounds are small and not too close together. There were a few sightings of birds, hares and other small desert animals. Apparently there are desert tortoises so take care when driving not to hurt them.I understand the sunrises and sunsets are just stunning so check the times. Stargazing is highly rated and there are many photo opportunities. However, the summers exceed 100F so it’s probably best to check the temperature forecasts. It is definitely cooler at higher elevations (and sometimes very windy) so dress in layers, have a hood or toque, and bring at least a SPF 30 sunscreen. Certain companies offer 2 day photo outings as well as other overnight tours which can easily be found on the internet."
40,A Must-See attraction,The rock formations and the Joshua Trees make this one of the most special places in the USA. The blue skies are super blue and the contrast with the wilderness makes for lots of picture perfect scenes.  Make sure this is on your Bucket List.
41,Always stunning,"I came to Joshua Tree on a trip to seven California national parks. There were plenty of nice things things to see. Along the park road, you will see many Joshua trees and unique rock formations. We only spent about 5 hours in the park, which was enough time to complete plenty of short hikes. We began on the Hidden Valley Trail. We saw plenty of birds and squirrels and were surrounded by interesting rock formations. The next trail we did, Barker Dam, was my favorite of them all. You begin in a flat valley with plenty of plants and rocks. You can also see the San Jacinto Mountains in the distance on a fairly clear day. On the trail I saw lizards, bluebirds, woodpeckers, and even mallard ducks at the reservoir at the end of the trail. There is some uphill hike at the end of the trail, but it's not to hard. Keyes View was also a nice sight. On top of seeing lizards there, the view shows you badlands, Coachella Valley, Salton Sea, and the San Jacinto Mountains. Three other sights I saw were Skull Rock, Arch Rock, and the Cholla Cactus Garden. None of these require long visits and are very unique. Overall, Joshua Tree is very pretty and has plenty of nice scenery, but it it one of the weaker California national parks in my opinion. This is partially because the views and scenery are on a much smaller scale. However, this park is still a nice day trip from Los Angeles and worth a visit."
42,Very Interesting place to see,Traveled for Joshua Tree from Phoenix for a day trip.  It is an amazing park with lots to do.  Could definitely spend several days here.  The drive from the south entrance to the northwest entrance is approximately 53 miles.  The entire park is amazing but the northwest section is high desert with amazing scenery.
43,Lovely National Park to Hike,Had a few fun days at JT. Climbed the Astro Dome in the Wonderlands and got thru the Chasm of Doom(really cool!!)   Not too crowded over a holiday weekend.
44,Beautiful Park with Three Marginal Visitor Centers,"Each National Park has something unique and Joshua Tree is no exception. The drive through the park is marvelous. There are several areas with unique features, such as the trees themselves, different types of cactus and unique rock formations.  There are numerous hikes to enjoy these. Many are 1 to 2 miles and quite easy. So, you can see a variety of areas and then drive to others,  without doing anything too strenuous. We also had a nice picnic where there were picnic tables scattered between rock formations, just north of the Skull Rock hike. Great place for a day trip!"
45,Beautiful,"Loved the diverse scenery. Thought it might just be ""desert scrub"" but was pleasantly surprised. Staff at the Cottonwood ranger station were knowledgeable and very helpful.  Glad we decided to visit!"
46,Wonderful Park,very cool to see the joshua trees - make sure you know they are in fact in the imddle of the parl - so alocate that into your drive we did not. it is pretty much a half day trip at the bare least if you are coming from palm springs including stops.
47,Two Deserts in One Park,This is a must visit park. The beautiful scenery is something out of a magazine. The Joshua Trees are true beauty. Rock formations and many roadside pull-offs. Wildlife especially at dusk. The rabbits are huge. I didn't care for the bats circling my head (lol). This is definitely in my top 5 parks to visit. We are currently plan our next trip to this awesome location. Stop by the gift shop during your visit. Friendly associates and many souvenirs.
48,AMAZING PARK,"Another jewel in our National Park System. Joshua trees, cholla and ocatillo cacti among so many other varieties gives this park a special look not seen in other southwestern parks. Road system allows for good observation and transit between the many pullouts and exhibits. Roadways had been cleared quickly of most of the runoff (sand, water, rocks...) from recent deluges in mid Feb. Trails are well marked and plentiful.. Numerous exhibits to explain the topology, terrain features, geological evolution of the area. Well worth the 3-5 hours to tour the park."
49,Not to be missed!,Windflowers galore in February. Worth checking out.  Drove through the park from the South cottonwood entrance to the west Joshua Tree entrance and stopped at several exhibits and short hikes along the way.  Pine City hike is the only one I would skip next time.  Very nice cause there was no crowd at the south entrance to get in.  Was a great day-trip.  Loved the cactus garden and Octillo patch.
50,Magical,"Unlike most National Parks, but well worth the trip.  So many formations of trees, rocks, and cactus, as well as birds and wildlife."
51,A wonderful place to spend about 6-8 hours,Winter day with everchanging clouds and light gave us dramatic views of the trees and rock mounds. Nice easy walks on trails through giant boulders and a beautiful pond that serviced the old cattle ranch.
52,A perfect day trip from LA ,"Took the long way from Palm Springs to 29 Palms, driving through the park.  Some amazing sights included the cactus plants, the mountains, the outcroppings of rock and boulder formations as well as the Joshua trees."
53,Very beautiful and fun,"Amazing hikes among one of the rarest plant on Earth, the Joshua tree. Along with the awesome rock formations it is one of my favorite park. I went in January and the temperature was in the mid-seventies, perfect"
54,"Great park, not so great visitors.","If there was no Joshua Tree National Park and somebody showed me the photo of that tree, I would think it’s not real. However, the Joshua tree isn’t the only thing worth seeing in the Park. Mixture of small and jumbo rocky formations, cactuses and Joshua trees makes this park an amazing place for a visit. We did a 1-day tour and visited most of the important spots. The majority of the park is accessible by car which makes a visit very efficient."
55,Fabulous,The only place you can see many Joshua trees and cholla cactus in such a beautiful land. About 2 hours driving from Los Angeles. The landscape is so fantastic. Be careful when you take a walk into the cactus bushes. They can really hurt.
56,Cold. Beautiful Joshua Tree.,Wonderful spot for a day trip or camping .  Many different venues and you’ll marvel at the scenes. Not busy the day we drove through. Went from the South entrance to the North.
57,dessert beyond beautiful,"Desolate landscape but stunning nevertheless. The Joshua Tree is almost unique to the park, and the interesting rock formation create a talking point. Initially the 30 dollars seemed a bit steep, as in the UK we don't pay to visit National Parks; the park is well kept with small areas for camping, and some signs and information boards. We were lucky to see a ground squirrel and a roadrunner."
58,Amazing scenery,"First time going to the desert and it blew my mind! Landscape is breathtaking and the sound of silence will give you some peace to your soul! Sunsets are a must if you are visiting, probably one of the best sunsets I’ve seen: I stoped in one of the main resting areas and climbed my way up in one of the big rocks! Had a awesome and unique view!"
59,My Favorite Place so Far! ,"From Intersection Rock to Arch Rock, from Skull Rock to Cap Rock and all the fantastic trees after which the park is named, in between, Joshua Tree is a spectacular day just waiting to be explored.As beautiful as it is rugged, as calming as it is exciting... a day spent here will never be wasted. Whether at sunrise, sunset or anytime in between the magnificent rocks and their surroundings are simply stunning. Well worth a visit."
60,"""Breathtaking Beauty""","Visited this NP whilst in Palm Springs for a few days.It is the most amazing place, other-worldly! The scenery goes from flat desert plain to huge boulders and mountains, some 60 miles of it, with cacti and amazing Joshua Tree’s.We went midday and spent the afternoon there, very few visitors around so plenty of parking for scenic views.We had been told that to go at night is good as the stars put on a spectacular show, unfortunately we didn’t have time for a repeat visit.Highly recommend."
61,A must see desert park,"What a beautiful landscape made by nature!!! The chollo cactus garden was a great little stop off driving through the park.  Don't be in a hurry and enjoy the stunning views!! There's hiking, rock climbing and camping available. Early spring when the wildflowers are in bloom is especially beautiful."
62,Outstanding!,"Incredible natural desert with the iconic amazing Joshua trees. Can check out all the main points on the map in the main park loop in one day. we drove from palm springs and arrived at west entrance at appx 12 pm, snacked at quail picnic area, took a short hike to barker dam, but due to heat was difficult especially for our little kids. we then drove to keys view which is a must see, we then went to the jumbo rocks/skull rock, another must see which little kids love, then drove out to visitor center in twenty nine palms ( the rangers were super helpful with info and recommendations) and to visit that and oasis of Mara, drove back into the park, had a supper at live oak picnic area, then drove down towards cottonwood springs and stopped at the cholla cactus garden which is also a must see at dusk, there were a lot of bees there though, then we visited cottonwood springs trail around sunset time and saw some wildlife there, a number of rabbits and even a what looked like a fox or coyote crossing the road. we got out of the car after sunset and viewed the dark skies with the natural lights of the stars popping out to finish the experience, which is another recommended thing to see. All in one day! only problem is that it was in august so it was very very hot. stay cool in your car between stops made it tolerable for a once in a lifetime experience!"
63,You Must Visit ,"The rock formations are stunning and the vegetation you won’t find elsewhere.   The Joshua tree is amazing and while more than an hour from Palm Springs, it is well worth the drive!  What a view over Coachella Valley!"
64,The high desert in all its midwinter glory,"Surrounded by desert, cactus and rock formations, Joshua Tree National Park is a great open space to pause and reflect and admire the scenery. The drive through the park takes about an a hour or so non stop but there are plenty of stopping points to see different aspects of the park. From cactus gardens to Skull Rock and plenty of camping areas, Joshua Tree is cool to spend a night in staring at the billion of stars on a clear summer evening."
65,Beautiful and magnificent,"Joshua Tree is a great place to visit if you want to see the high desert up close and personal. It has a variety of flora and fauna and a fascinating geologic history. There are huge piles of boulders scattered over one side of the park that look right out of the Flintstones. On the other side is a cactus garden, completely different from the high side of the park. There are several short hikes, good for those who don't have the stamina to hike 5 or 10 miles, Be sure to stop at Hidden Valley, Key's View, Skull Rock, Barker Dam and Arch Rock."
66,Joshua Tree National Park Is A MUST SEE!,"What an amazing National Park.  We hiked, we played, we watched the sunset and sunrise, we enjoyed the sunshine and the beautiful weather.  I would def recommend this for  a fall, winter or spring trip do not go during the Summer. We went the week after major storms washed out some roads in the south so a few trails and roads were still unavailable to us."
67,A must see!,"Absolutely stunning park. Plenty to see and do. The joshua trees are all around and you can either get your pics of them on the hikes or pull over on the side of the road (at least coming from the north end of the park along Park Blvd). Hidden Valley hike is a nice 1 mile trek and probably about as long as you want to hike in the summer (arrive early as it will get blazing hot). Cholla Garden is also worth walking through especially if you're a cactus lover like my wife. The ocotillo patch is also neat (just a short drive beyond the cholla garden) if you're into desert plants. In general, be prepared for bees though. Our car got swarmed by them at Key's View where there ironically wasn't any warning signs about them (Cholla Garden had signs and we didn't see a single bee). Apparently, as we were told later, the bees are thirsty during the summer and are attracted to the moisture generated by cars. Fortunately we didn't get stung and all of the bees either died in the car from heat or flew out while we were driving, but if you know you have any kind of allergic reactions and plan to visit during the summer (we're told they're not as bad in cooler months), just come prepared or look out for them and avoid those spots. Overall, even though it's crazy hot in the summer, if that's when you can visit, don't be deterred. Even though some of the areas are closed and you'll want to avoid any serious physical activity in the middle of the day, we had no problem arriving early and leaving by noon and feeling like we got our money's worth. Also, you'll likely basically have the park to yourself since summer is the off season. I don't think we saw more than about 10 cars throughout the day. Also, just know that if you arrive super early to beat the heat, if there's nobody at the front gate to pay, you can just pay on the way out."
68,Great Place To Spend The Day,"First time visitor.  We were looking forward to seeing the Joshua trees in a desert landscape but the trees were only a small part of our awesome trip through the park.  We entered through the south (Cottonwood) entrance and exited (3 hours later) at the west exit.  It had snowed a few days before but we did not expect it to stick around.  Wrong!  The snow added to the already beautiful landscape.  We were awed by the rock formations, cactus gardens, views, and, of course, the Joshua trees.  Lots of camping spots and day picnic areas.  We will be back!"
69,  Blissfulness ,"You come to Joshua Tree to connect with eons of geologic time. Ancient rocks, unique trees and the full expanse of the high desert. If you just drive through then you will most likely yawn and head off to the rancid interior of a casino or the plastic of a strip mall.So, stop. Walk to one of the massive rock piles. With as the rocks become higher and higher, towering over you, often as smooth as cream, gold against the blue sky. The quietness will envelop you, and ask you to stay.The rocks will call out to be climbed. And the smoother rocks will be easy for almost any age. The higher ones will challenge the professional climber.Make sure to walk on the rocks. Sit at the top, or as high as you dare, and look around. The Joshua Tree forest (yes, technically that is correct) is unique, wonderful and under huge environmental stress.Stay after the sun sets and watch the sky fill with millions of stars.After a few days in the high desert the rest of life will shift into the correct perspective. There is heart in this place, ancient heart, beating very slowly, deep time and you will need to be still and quiet to hear its beat."
70,Super Special National Park,"Joshua Tree is a huge, stunningly beautiful park of impressive rock formations. Hiking can be challenging, in more than one way, but much can be seen from your car if you choose to drive through.  Being from Minnesota, I was not familiar with the Cholla cactus, known as the “jumper”.  We got out of our car to walk through a “cactus garden” that consisted of hundreds of cactus, mostly chollas.  If you come near these plants, barely grazing them, the balls of spines will attach to you. It does not seem like you really even have to touch the things. Unless equipped with heavy leather gloves or a large tongs or pliers, you will not be able to remove these fellows.  At 4:30 p.m., the nearest ranger station was closed when we arrived so we had to head for the interstate to get cell service.  911 directed us to the nearest ER.  The ball was attached to one finger with about 15 or so spines embedded in one finger.  Each spine is barbed, like a fish hook. Removing them required quite the procedure.  The tech doing the removal said that the towel under my hand should be burned to prevent anyone else touching the thing because it would “jump” again.  At least they are not poisonous.  Beautiful, but hostile area. Just be careful!"
71,Great walk and picnic lunch.,"The terrain is just breathtakingly beautiful.   Rock formations and the the joshua trees- are a sight to see.  We went during an extremely hot day so be sure to take plenty of water.  This was a day trip for us and if you enter via the south entrance, we aware that the Joshua Trees are not visible for a 45 mins drive into the park.  Be sure to bring a hat, sunblock and good walking shoes."
72,A Must Do Incredible Park!!,Joshua Tree NP never disappoints! A place where the Colorado and Mohave Deserts meet! Awesome rock formations and of course the ancient Joshua Tree! Recommend to enter from the south as the park visitation has quadrupled in last few uears
73,Friends ,"This is the time of the year to visit, perfect temperature to hike around the desert. The rock formations, joshua trees and other desert plants are incredible. The old mine sites and the overlook of the Palm Springs valley are must does. There is a new Fairfield Marriott and some chain restaurants available in the city of Yucca Valley."
74,Underrated National Park!,"Joshua Tree is beautiful!   There are many beautiful trails and vistas.  The landscape is so striking.  It was a quick visit for us, but enjoyable nonetheless."
75,Surreal,What an experience.. one of the better National Parks and well worth the drive through.Great scenery and many things to look at.   Some nice Hikes available for all levels.Just an Amazing place.
76,Amazing view,"Two deserts, one amazing experience.  The natural beauty of the park is simply breathtaking and unlike anything I've ever seen."
77,Very Interesting,"We visited during spring break. Did a drive through trip. Started at Oasis Visitors Center and sat in on a Ranger Talk on Desert Tortoises. Then drove to Cholla Cactus Garden in Colorado Desert. Then back to Mojave Desert to see Skull rock, Jumbo rocks and Keys View. Exited at Western Visitor’s center.Saw some beautiful flowers - yellow, white, orange, pink, purple, red. Also we saw a jack rabbit, couple of desert rats, lizards, ravens and a couple of birds.The entry pass for the car is valid for a week. We should have done a night trip to see the stars but didn’t."
78,Drive through or hile,Its an amazing place . To see the boulder formations was incredible . I never knew there were so many types of cactus plants. We hiked and had lunch in the park three different days. There is so much to see . Talking with park rangers was very informative . We got home last week and learned the park is CLOSED today . How lucky we were to get to visit the park
79,Pure Bliss,"This is an interesting huge park but may be disappointing to those expecting something like Yosemite or other woodsy type parks. Remember, this is desert terrain. The Joshua trees are all in the northern part of the park as is most of the interesting sites. As you head south towards I-10 it becomes increasingly barren. We spent about three hours driving through this park and stopping at accessible spots. Obviously, if you want to explore the various hiking trails you could spend all day or many days. It was beautiful and cool when we were there in mid Oct. midday high only reached low 70’s. But clearly it can get extremely hot in summer. Overall, a nice and strikingly different National Park well worth a visit."
80,BREATHTAKING!,"This park has so much to offer. There are fascinating landscapes and rock formations, and strange, yet beautiful plants and animals. It also has very dark night skies, which gives stargazers excellent views of constellations on clear nights."
81,Beautiful park!,We really enjoyed our visit there. So many rock formations and all those quirky amazing Joshua Trees.it is just beautiful !!!
82,Majestic,"We are avid trail runners & we loved loved loved running through Joshua Tree National Park. A tip straight up... go early, even earlier than the 8am park opening time. We thought we could only go at 8am but when we got there realised that there is no boom gate (& no ranger) & some locals told us you can pay on your way out. So off we drove to find a trail to run. We ran the Willow Hole trail (starting on the Boy Scout trail) & it was great. It is reasonably flat, a slight ascent in parts. Amazing scenery & not too hot. Definitely take water & maybe some food if you are walking. Looking forward to coming back & running some more trails in the area."
83,Wonderful.,What a beautiful place. Never seen anything like this before apart from TV. Went over from south to north around 4.30 in the afternoon and took around 2 hours to cross with a few stops. Cactus gardens were interesting along with curious rock formations. Hundreds of Joshua trees in northern part of park. Would visit again if had more time to explore
84,Amazing experience,"The landscape is stunning and so much more than Joshua Trees, the rock formations are beautiful. Facilities are basic at best and primitive at worst, you are in the wilderness and to provide anything other than what's already there would ruin this gorgeous place.Signs along some trails are minimal and to avoid getting lost late one afternoon we backtracked as we'd lost the markers for the circular walk, it was a shame but you need to be safe."
85,Take a short cut to SFO and avoid LA,"We drove through the park from the low desert which has totally different foliage from the high desert.The drive,parking vistas, picnic areas are well marked..Bring lots of water and beware of bees..Children will enjoy the jumbo rocks to climb."
86,New Year’s Day,"Joshua Tree is almost as famous as Yosemite in the UK so I had very high hopes. We came here for a day trip and stopped at  the hidden valley point for a short hike. The nature, scenery and surrounding are very very spectacular. But, the whole experience was slightly ruined by the sheer volume of people there - there simply wasn’t a quiet moment to take it all in. I’m sure that with more planning, careful selection of a quiet hiking spot and time of year would yield a different experience. Also, if you’re a experienced climber it seems to be one of those places you can really enjoy.Maybe my high expectations were misplaced,but I much more preferred the Anza-Borrego for a more raw desert experience.Joshua Tree is very much worth a visit, but expect a large volume of people and a “public attraction” feel, rather than a close experience with nature."
87,Fantastic!,"The country has a bounty of national parks but Joshua Tree is one of the truly unique other worldly experiences you can have. Whether covered in snow or a warm spring day this park is a must see bucket list destination.There is so much to see and do, especially if you like hiking, that one day will simply not be enough."
88,"Amazing Park, Worth the Visit!","Wow, what a great day we had at Joshua Tree National Park, beautiful park, easy to get to, plan the whole day, it is amazing. Hiking and Rock Climbing."
89,Amazing national park,"Before this trip I had seen so many photos of the Joshua Trees and thought they're beautiful! When I was planning my trip, I had to decide between JTNP and another place, and oh boy, am I glad I chose JTNP! The Joshua Trees are even more beautiful in person than on photos! There are so many beautiful sights aside from that, and so many great hiking trails. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves hiking. I would recommend at least 3 days at the park (that wasn't enough for me). And I would recommend not just driving through and seeing what's along the road, because the deeper you go, the more beauty you see!"
90,Drive through at snowy time,"The rock formations, the desert, the open spaces and the joshua trees throughout make for a very enjoyable ride or even overnight camping experience.  The desert will easily drop 40 or 50 degrees at night (depending on the time of year) so dress warmly and watch out for snakes.  We filmed here over the course of a few days.   Loved the location.  The park service was a little scatter brained however.  We paid for a monitor to travel with us to certain locations and the monitor never showed up so we were told to just ""go and shoot.""   There's lots of places to stop and take in the scenery.  There's a rather impressive Joshua Tree Bar at the north end of the park after you exit."
91,So much more than Joshua trees!,"Wow, the Joshua Tree National Park is a MUST SEE. So many photo opportunities and memorable sights. I recommend a visit to the Visitor Center before entering the park."
92,Joshua Tree National Park Day Trip,"Very uplifting visit and drive through the park from the Cottonwood entrance on south side through to the Joshua tree town exit on north west side. Practical stuff, it takes about 1.5 hours to drive through, plus the stops you choose to make for photos etc. Be sensible by carrying plenty of water, have good footwear and respect that you are in a very hot and sometimes isolated natural environment. The trees themselves are worth the visit alone but there are many other species of trees, cacti and other plants, some flowering. Then you have the spectacular rocks and mountain ranges which are jaw dropping scenery. Some of the weird things we saw on our route; lots of people climbing rocks in flip flops and zero head protection, ‘selfie dogs’ being carried around in 100+ temperatures. Not sure if it occurs to the amateur rock climbers what happens when they fall/break limbs and there is no phone signal and they can’t reach water?A must see place in the valley, worth travelling in for this on it’s own."
93,"Worth a trip, catch a ranger,",Joshua Tree National Park features spectacular rock formations framed by the famous Joshua Trees. The drive from LA is well rewarded and highly recommended.
94,Find the Boy Scout trail for a good hike,"Had a gorgeous day in February driving from Rancho Mirage to Joshua Tree. Beautiful drive about 45 minutes. I was blown away by the unexpected beauty of this place. Mountains are diverse tall, rocky, smooth, rolling each area was different. The cholla garden was unbelievable and then the Joshua trees! The many rocks, boulders were gorgeous. We could have spent hours and hours. Several camping areas there..wish i had time for that. Be sure to pack a picnic lunch because there are several picnic tables in gorgeous sites to absorb your amazing surroundings. Wish we had thought of this, but was our first trip and didn’t know what to expect. There are lots of hiking trails throughout the park to take advantage of depending upon your time. Can not emphasize enough of how beautiful this place is. There are restaurants just outside of park area."
95,Enjoyable Visit ,"This national park was truly magnificent. As an East Coast resident it was such a unique terrain to see. Watch out for the cholla cactus plants however. If you see a ball of cactus floating in the breeze steer clear, it feels like a ball of barbed wire! They are called jumping cactus for good reason. The restrooms in the park were some of the cleanest I've ever seen in any national park, and the visitor centers were friendly and helpful. Joshua tree is a must see if you're going to hit up any of the US National parks. Also the sunsets!!!"
96,Spectacular Desert Solitude and Majesty,"The good news: a beautiful park with amazing diversity of plants and animals. The bad news: the three visitor centers (two on the north and one on the south) are quite small and not of the quality one usually sees at the National Parks. The south entrance visitor center is particularly small with limited displays and restroom facilities. Be sure and take food and beverages -- especially water -- into the park with you. Highlights include the Cottonwood Spring Oasis near south (Cottonwood Spring) visitor center, Keys View and the Cholla Cactus Garden. The park includes Colorado Desert to the south, transition areas and the Mojave Desert to the north. We visited in early February and weather was perfect. We arrived from our overnight in Palm Desert at the south Cottonwood Spring entrance and drove to Keys View and on to Joshua Tree Visitor Center. We went down the highway to Oasis Visitor Center which appears to be the major visitor center in terms of displays and facilities. Oasis Visitor Center also has a lovely paved walking trail and a roadrunner hanging around the parking lot."
97,""" To Be Seen """,Joshua Tree is a very unique place!  Coming from London its like nowhere I have ever been! It snowed the day before we arrived so looked beautiful! It was busy over Christmas but we managed to find some off the beaten hikes which were amazing! The views of the trees and mountains are incredible and if you stay for the sunset its like a dream! Then look up and see the stars - like nothing I've seen before! Don't miss this amazing place!!
98,"Nice park, Great scenery ",We went to Joshua tree national park to catch the sunset and the views were incredible.  After sunset stay for the lights to go down so you can catch the amazing views of the stars.
99,Amazing place!,most awesome place on earth🌞Beyond beautiful Hiking Trails and routes are so interesting and beautiful.We did many trails in one day from morning to evening.The Joshua Trees and other wildlife is so special here.Sun rise and sun set is a must seedesert 🌵 beyond good
100,Hiking,"Unbelievable national park. It is enormous and has countless numbers of the unique Joshua trees, which come in various forms and sizes. Great for photography. Lots of places to stop. Bring lots of water."
101,Beautiful desert scenery,"We were amazed by the beauty of this place! Did some hiking around and enjoyed the sights. Much better in person to see the sights. When we were there, the weather was a little cool but at least it was slightly cloudy and dry. We would love to go back again when the weather is warmer!"
102,LOVED This place,I thought it was a cool park. But the least cool of the 7 national parks I’ve been. Id go again but it’s not must see.
103,Great for Photographers,"Did the driving tour of Joshua Tree National Park on one of the hotter days in August. It was 100°. We took plenty of water and heeded all warnings. We did a driving tour and did not hike because of the heat. We did not bother the bees that were looking for moisture. We took in the views and marveled at various trees (especially the Joshua trees) and plants and cacti and rocks and boulders. We stayed on high alert for rattlesnakes and scorpions. And we didn't feed the wildlife, so we did see cute like animals at Key View."
104,Surprise gem,Beautiful place to drive and see starsGo midday for drive and walk around for hiking......if you go there winter time sunset start early to see beautiful sunset.And see stars....i wish i had DSL camera..
105,Amazing Views,$30 for the day with lots to see in an amazing park.Very busy with lots of stops for hikes and sights.Amazing rock formations and the classic Joshua Tree.The desert was flush with blooming flowers and plants after a rainfall the weeks before our visit.This was worth the visit even though the traffic was heavy.
106,Amazing Park ,"Joshua Tree is such a spectacular place for hiking, climbing or just admiring the landscape and vegetation. Each area brings more awe inspiring views to see.Bring lots of water with you so you stay hydrated as well as many layers to be able to take off or put on because the temperature can change quickly.Give yourself lots of time to do the different trails because it’s well worth it.Make sure you have the opportunity to see the sun setting and the stars at night because it’s a whole other level of beauty."
107,Excellent half-day adventure,"You get to drive through the park and make stops along the way to see the magnificent views of mountains, rock formations, and trees.  Didn't get to see any wildlife, but it was still breath taking to look at.  They allow people to camp overnight, but I wouldn't want to do that in the desert."
108,A Must Visit Place if you near!,"Took the drive through Joshua Tree National Park. The Joshua trees are stark but beautiful. I enjoyed the trip and recommend making this a stop. I'm on my way back home after completing Route 66. Great to have more places to visit. This park is located where the Colorado Desert and the Mojave Desert meet. These trees grow well in this area. With ongoing climate change, scientists aren't sure if these trees will live. The Majove is at higher elevations and therefore somewhat cooler. Additional heat may kill the trees. They don't need much water because they don't grow more than an inch and a half in most years and in drier years, less than that. The trees don't generate growth rings so there isn't a way to tell how old they are. It is believed that the oldest trees are over 1000 years old."
109,Dessert Splendor,"The park was so much more than we anticipated!  Beautiful rock structures and Joshua Trees.  Our four year old enjoyed exploring the rocks and identifying the various cacti.  We did not follow any specific trails, just stopped at various parking areas and explored.  Highly recommend and wish we had more than a day to explore all of the sights!"
110,One of the best national parks,Joshua Tree National Park is worth the time and drive. Very interesting to see. Lots of great hikes and for all levels of hikers. About an hour from downtown Palm Springs and give yourself at least three hours to experience the Park but could be there all day. Stop in at visitor information for park pass and detailed mapsNoelle Halcrow Vancouver
111,Truly Worth a Visit,"It was a very nice experience, my first one in a desert and in this park you can see two different ecosystems Mojave and Colorado creating different landscapes!It’s Well organized for camping and also a daily trip, small wildlife into the park! Strongly recommended and do not forget to carry with you the water ... impossibility to buy it inside the park and really hot!"
112,Wonderful National Park Experience,"If you find yourself in the southeastern part of California, this national park is a must visit. Made famous by the abundance of Joshua Trees which are found nowhere else in the world, this place is amazing. In addition to the trees, there are unworldly rock formations and the stark beauty of the high dessert. Admittance to the park is expensive, $30 per car, but worth every penny."
113,Must see stop while doing California tour,"We went during the government shutdown, saw next to no one, loved the boulders, excellently marked and well-maintained trails. Early wildfloweer display this year in the south end of the park. Fabulous!"
114,Totally doable in just one day!,"Went with friends as we were staying in Palm Springs and had a hire car. This experience was fantastic, great hiking trails, not to be missed!"
115,Crazy trees and amazing rocks - this is incredible!,"This National Park is truly a pleasure!  The landscape and scenery are amazing.  Located in the Mohave desert, just an hour from Palm Springs, and the mountains in the background form the backdrop for the most unique outcroppings of boulders I have ever seen.  Vegetation features the Joshua trees and various types of cacti throughout the park.  The scenery is fantastic with one scenic outlook of the Coachella Valley that is awesome.  If you are in the area, do not miss this amazing natural phenomenon!"
116,For a national park it’s a little different,Lots of doable trails in this park for walking. This park is bigger than it seems. Over 20 miles from one end to the other. We spent a couple of days exploring some of the trails that wound around the park. The weather in February was just the right temperature for a light jacket.
117,Beautiful!!,We rented an Airbnb in middle of Park.  It was starkly beautiful.  There are hikes of all levels.  I had hurt my back but still wanted to hike.  Found a very easy 1 mile hike that was fun and scenic.  It was chilly but bright sun so we just layered. We went to cactus garden with plants never saw before.  Probably lots to do but we enjoyed a Quiet restful few days with my daughter's in-laws. Will come again
118,Unusual but nice park,We went in January to the Joshua Tree national park. The park was so beautiful. All the beautiful wildflowers were blooming and there was little traffic on a Monday. Must stop at the visitor center in Joshua Tree.
119,Unusual and beautiful,"Joshua Tree is such a wonderful unique place.  It has wonderful climbing, amazing views, and lots of sun.  Perfect in December."
120,Interesting Park,"Unique desert rock formations and mountain scenes.  A wide range of hikes, from 1 to 10 miles.  Gives you the sense of what it was like to try and settle this area of the country."
121,A must see,"Wasn't quite sure what a Joshua Tree looked like in person.  It is a beautiful tree with hard pointy ""leaves"".  It was a good drive from Palm Springs and there are many food options on the way.  Once you get into the park there is no food or drinks available. Very peaceful walking around and seeing all the different rock formations, the Joshua Trees and so much more.  Some of the hikes, even those marked easy, were hard on the knees.  The uneven terrain and the ascent and descent makes it difficult.  We drove right through the park and visited the Cholla Cactus Garden at the other end.  It was an interesting garden to visit and to notice the differences between both sides of the National Park.Overall it was one of our best activities on our holiday."
122,"Nice rocks, so-so trees","My wife, grown daughter and I visited Joshua Tree on 2 different days. The Cottenwood entrance in the south was first since we were staying in Indio. We stopped at the visitor center then enjoyed the hike around Mastadon Peak. Afterwards we drove as far as the Chollo Cactus Gardens then hit the Barada Nature trail on our way out. We spent almost a full day doing that but we like to take our time and look around. A few days later we drove to the Joshua Tree entrance in the west. We met Jerry at the visitor center who couldn't be more helpful (actually everyone we met was wonderful). We hiked Hidden Valley, Barker Dam, Cap Rock and Skull Rock (don't lose the trail midway in the parking lot like we did). We ultimately left via the north Oasis entrance and saw the Oasis of Mara. Throughout the park there are places to pull over and exhibits to view. We even saw a kit fox. The trees, rocks and various cacti, especially the chollo and ocotillo, were beautiful and Dr. Seus-like. As you will frequently read, there is no cell sevice and you need lots of water. We were surprised how cool it was in the first week of October. Shorts were ok but a heavy shirt felt good. I highly recommend seeing the park in 2 days if possible. Each area is different and none should be rushed through. Like most national parksm, the trails are well marked and easy to follow. There were quite a few people there but, for the most part, it felt uncrowded. The national parks, especially Joshua Tree, is a wonderland for everyone."
123,Everything I hoped for and more...,"We first drove through  north part of the park which was very pretty.  It’s not as dramatic as Zion or Capitol Reef but is striking and unusual with the unique shapes created by the trees.  We then drove south toward the Cottonwood gate.  For me, that part of the park was overall a little boring."
124,Old Favourite,"The Joshua Tree is everywhere... almost. The various ecosystems included the namesake tree but also domains without any, and cacti to replace them. Great for climbing, whether you like a good scramble or ropes. And lots of hiking, flora, and fauna. This is a must do."
125,Amazing nature experience ,"Wow!!!! This place was awesome. There were a lot of rock climbers. Lots of easy on & off rocks to climb on, especially for children. The dam area & water were absolutely beautiful. Lots off places to parmk & explore. If you have a dog read up on where you can take them. Bookstore was well stocked with mementos & things to read. Nice displays on the history of the area. Rangers give great presentations. You could drive from the LA area for a single day visit & do a good tour here, but you would need to leave LA pretty early in the morning. Palm Springs & other local communities have a good variety of places to stay & there are campsites. We skipped a portion of the long entrance line with a Senior pass. GO!!!"
126,Beautiful scenery and hikes,"Easy to navigate, straightforward maps, amazing hikes with helpful descriptions from which to choose level.   Bathrooms were a bit rough and not always stocked but our parks have been grossly underfunded!   Spent 3 days in and out of the park and could have stayed longer!"
127,Something For Everyone ,This National Park is amazing! The trees with their unique shapes and survival strategy make this place really special. For the people who watched in their childhood Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote here are living the real aniimals of this cartoon.
128,Unique experience,"We visited Joshua Tree National Park over two days and enjoyed every minute of our time there.  The park has two ecological areas in it - the Mojave desert and the Colorado desert.  Driving from one to the other is really interesting.  As we drove, the scenery seemed very gray and uninteresting, but then we realized, as we looked closer and especially when we got out of the car, that the ground was covered with a variety of plants, the rocks were covered with different colored lichens, and the cacti and trees were varied and beautiful.  It had rained the week before we were there, so the wildflowers were blooming which is somewhat unusual.  The Joshua trees were also blooming and that was really a thing to see.  There are several 1+ or - mile long trails that we enjoyed - Hidden Valley, Skull Rock and Barker Dam.  Most of the terrain was fairly flat, but there was some up and down and rock jumping.  I tend to struggle a bit at high altitudes and I did so a bit on the elevation gains.  But it was worth the effort.  The drive up to Keys View is a must.  If you have time, check the daily calendar and go on a ranger led walk. Very informative."
129,Beautiful National Park!!!,The park is very beautiful.  Lots of opportunity to pull off and explore on your own.  The park is HUGE and takes a long time to get through.   Allow at least 4 hours to go through.  Make sure to take along water and snacks.  Lots of Joshua Trees and rock formations in the northern part of the park. Southern part is more open with cactus.
130,Amazing Nature even in August with little kids,"This is a fantastic park. Camping, picnics, rock climbing and many levels of experience for hiking from easy half mile to strenuous multi mile..... this place has it all! And did I mention the views?!  Literally everywhere you look there is beauty!  Some things to be cautious about.. bees, fire ants and your footing. When it comes to being prepared, freeze water bottles 3/4 full the night before then top off when you leave.  Snacks, flashlight, whistle etc are necessary for some trails and just water for others.  Some are well marked in places with arrows and rocks marking the paths. Others have questionable areas that are hard to tell. So many mountains so if you get your bearings before starting you’ll be good. P.S.   if you take your time and look closely, there are faces and animals formed by the rocks. It makes you feel like they are watching over you!"
131,The view never gets old,This National Park is a little out of the way but once there it is stunning.  Lots of good hiking and plenty of good photo opportunities.  One tip enter the park from the Twenty Nine Palms.  This will get you to the exhibits and gift shop without a long wait.  Go later in the day or early in the morning to capture shadows if taking pictures.
132,Just Nice,speechless! one of the most beautiful park Ihave visited in a long time! full of beautiful surprises and scenery! mountains; cactus and of course Joshua Trees. you have to go! staff very helpful a 2h00 drive
133,Unique but hot in August ,"We took a drive through Joshua Tree NP, staying on the main roads.  (also did a Hummer tour of the back roads a different day)  So many stops to make where there is signage explaining what you are seeing. We spent the whole day in the park, stopping, reading, exploring, hiking, and just enjoying."
134,Boulders and Joshua trees,"Joshua Tree National Park is an excellent day trip from Palm Springs.  The scenery is breathtaking.  I loved all the rock formations and of course the Joshua Trees.  There are lots of opportunities for hikes of all levels.  You will be outside a lot, so it is nice when it isn’t too hot outside!"
135,Quite and peaceful,I can’t say enough good things about this place! Being from Texas this place was like being in another world! We had a lot of fun hiking and climbing on all the rock out croppings! For sure go here if in the area!
136,Breathtaking scenery,"Great park to visit if staying in Palm Springs.Can be done easily in the course of a day.Lots of the sights are only a short stroll from the road, so perfect if the temperature is around 30+ degrees.Rangers at the north entrance really helpful in planning your visit."
137,UNREAL,"Most of people go here for seeing rocks, not the trees. The Cottonwood visitor center is not big, suggest you to go there to find out how the rock came out that way, very interesting. You can hike and camp there to see the stars night time. It’s about two hours drive without stopping through the park. it’s one hour driving to the border city Blythe between California and Arizona."
138,Start from the North side of the park,"The different landscapes that you see while in Joshua Tree is incredible.  To me, the boulder piles are the coolest part.  Skull Rock, White Tank, Hall of Horrors, and Intersection Rock were all highlights for me.  Climbing around the rocks was really cool.  The Joshua Trees are very interesting.  We have seen our fair share going though Mohave NP on the way down, but the size and concentration of them here, especially on the way to Keys View was amazing.  Keys View and Cholla Cactus Garden were also highlights.  It was way too hot during our visit, but I imagine the hiking is spectacular in the cooler seasons."
139,worth a day trip,"One of our very favorite places to visit!  Such epic beauty, yet able to enjoy regardless of physical capabilities.  We had an 11 year old and an 85 year old in our family traveling with us... and there was truly something for everyone!  Love Joshua Tree National Park!!"
140,Drive by beauty,"This was our first time here.  We loved walking among the beautiful huge rocks on several trails we took.  Although the government was shut down and the visitor's center was closed, we were so thankful to be able to get in the park.  The outdoor restrooms were very clean. The weather was lovely as well, and the park was not crowded."
141,wow ,"This place makes you feel the vastness of the Cosmos, makes you feel humble, makes you feel not to take yourself too hard. Abundant expanse of the rocks, the horizons and the sprinkling of the iconic Joshua trees all around you, far from the maddening crowd, shrills of the vehicles, hustles of the civilization, canopy of the stars at night makes you feel you are amidst the desert garden of the stars - nowhere to come from and nowhere to go! Via exit 117 off IS-10, one can enter the Twenty-nine Palms Highway en route JTNP. There are multiple picnic, hiking and camping spots around this vast national park and as soon as one enters cannot miss the glimpses of the iconing Joshua trees and big boulder rocks - supposed to be worlds one of the oldest rock formations. Worth every penny for a day-trip or an overnight camping trip."
142,Do not enter at the City of Joshua Tree ,"This was a great day trip!  The scenery was incredible, the roads made the park accessible.  I’m from the Midwest and the opportunity to see this wild life and geology was fantastic."
143,Day trip from Palm Springs ,Any trip to Coachella Valley or Palm Springs should include a trip here. One day or 3 days it’s a must.  If you do the one day trip enter on the south side exit 168 on the 10 and drive north.  Less traffic in that direction.  Many hikes to do some are a couple of hours others longer.  Camping is great lots of cool sites. Dam trail is good and short. When you leave you will be in Joshua Tree with restaurants/bars before you take 62 back to valley Will I Go Back?  Absolutely. Want to stay longer.  Let’s view is good but check weather before you take the detour off main road.  Gorgeous!
144,Amazing place to visit,"We did a driving tour from Twentynine Palms, CA south through the park. The Joshua Trees are very interesting to see. We plan on going back and doing the loop that starts at Joshua Tree, CA. We were there the last of January and the weather was nice in the mid 60's may not be the best place to visit in mid summer.  There are trails of different lengths you can do walking and overnight camping."
145,"Where else can you see Joshua trees, Ocotillos, Chollas, and jackrabbits!","This park is a must visit! I’ve been to several national parks and this one is definitely a stand out. It’s a very strange landscape filled with the most unique plant life. There are a lot of great hacking trails and wonderful climbing opportunities. When it came to the people though, it was a different story. Unlike the other National Parks I’ve been to, most people here were rude and inconsiderate. We had a person try and take our campsite and then many people at the park’s iconic spots were rude, trying to get ahead of you or get mad because there’s too many people in their picture."
146,Beautiful trees ,"No need for many words just a must place to see and experience nature. Many camping options with plenty of clean restrooms for a national park. Visit for daily use or long term camping up to (14) days Joshua Tress National  is Amazing. Annual National park pass is your best value with a daily camp fee. I highly recommend a visit here even if your a tourist from another country. If visiting for day use only bring food & water, etc. Visit early morning to get the most of it."
147,A place to see a place to be...,"We started at the West Entrance of the Joshua Tree National Park, traveled to Key View and exited the park at the South Entrance. This gave us the opportunity to cover a large amount of territory in just a few hours. There are no food services within the park. The vistas are amazing! Large boulder formations, Skull Rock, expansive views, Joshua trees as far as the eye could see, the Cholla Cactus Garden and the meeting of the Mojave Desert with the Colorado Desert were all well worth the effort to see. Due to recent heavy rains all unpaved roads were closed the day we were there. The park has a magical. other worldly quality due to the unusual trees. Stop at the visitor center for maps and information. There are small gift shops at both the West and South entrances."
148,Mojave Desert Location with Unique Trees and Rock Formations,"Visited Joshua tree natl park last week. This is a great place to visit and take the family  there are a lot of picnic areas hiking trails, camping areas, and places to have a picnic which we did twice. Highly recommend"
149,Awesome!,"We drove from the south to the north and were amazed at the dramatic changes in landscape. We are not hardy hikers and it was very hot so we can’t comment on the various trails. That said, I suggest you plan to hike in the morning and chill somewhere or drive around in the afternoon. It’s just too hard for me to put into words how awe-inspiring this park is, but I highly recommend it for your bucket list."
150,Whaaaa?,The amazing boulders are a must to stop and take millions of pictures. Every corner is a nature wonder. Highly recommended.
151,I usually give 5 stars but....,Great day trip from Pal Springs. Went in the south entrance and came out the NW corner near Joshua Tree town. Stop at the many viewpoints and just take it all in. Lots of trails short and long ! My wife thought we were going to see a tree and that was it. Was she ever surprised.
152,Interesting informative National Park – 4 out of 5 rating,I was in impressed with this national park.   If you really want to hike it might be worth it.  To drive around the park the landscape is underwhelming  It was not worth the price of admission
153,Amazing to see this National Park!,"This is a beautiful park to spend at least 1/2 day at!  This park was a lot bigger than I anticipated.  It’s good to first stop at the visitor center for a map and know where to stop.  As you drive further in you find more terrain to look at- the cactus, the trees, the boulders - it’s so unique and beautiful!  I wish I had more time here.  Make sure to bring some water with you."
154,A Must See,Outstanding day trip enjoyed with friends . We were blown away by the scenery and landscapes. You must visit !!!
155,Natural wonders surround you,We had 2 nights at Palm Springs and wanted to visit the Joshua Tree Park.  We tried to find reviews but most of them directed us to tours or specific places that we did not want to do.  We had our own car and one day to explore but we did this in 4-5 hours tops inlcuding driving.  We decided to leave our accomodation in Palm desert early 7.30am and we it took us just over an hour to get to the gate entrance (North).  We were pleased we left early as we had read reviews of it being too busy in the middle of the day.  We decided to just drive the loop and exit out the other west end which was a wise decision rather than going out the cottonwood entrance.  It took us about 1.5 hours to drive including stop off at the Jumbo Rocks (Skull rock) and Key Views.   Photos do not do this place justice.  It is an amazing park full of rocks and trees but the landscape makes it so different and spectacular.  In places we were the only ones there (Jumbo rocks) and we were able to climb all over the rocks and take some amazing photos.  Key views is worth the drive.  We did not stop off by the Dam or Hidden valley as by that stage we had had enough of looking at rocks and trees but would have loved to either do a hike there.  I would also recommend going at sunset as it would be so different with the colours.    We went in May at it was very chilly up in the park so take extra clothing!!
156,Best part of our trip!,"The Visitors Center is small and very busy (even in winter).  About an hour from Palm Springs.  Much to see and do so plan your day(s).  In one day do we did Hidden Valley, Jumbo Rocks ( with a Ranger tour) and the Cactus Garden and then drove out to the South (35 miles of less than interesting terrain).  But we left a lot undone.An amazing place."
157,Long drive to get there from Vegas but worth it! ,"We entered from the Joshua Tree/west entrance visitor center and had a great time driving through to the Oasis/north visitor entrance.  The views are fascinating and changing almost around every bend.  Stopped at Keys View and had a clear day so could see all the way to the Salton Sea.  Ranger was there and answered lots of questions about the geology that we were seeing.View of the cities below us, mountains as the back drop and Salton Sea off to the corner - wow!"
158,Best place to visit in Palm Springs,"We have visited the Joshua Tree National Park many times and always enjoy this unique area. There are 3 visitor centres but this is the best to start your visit at, it has a short Oasis trail out back and a small cactus garden too. Don't miss The Hidden Valley trail which we think is the most stunning of all, real Wild West legend stuff and the best view is up at Keys View which is a must do"
159,Amazing,The trees and the rocks were amazing. We went on a small hike. They were people from all over the world. It was so nice to get back to nature. I highly recommend this. But make sure you wear sneakers or some kind of boots If you want to hike. And bring your own water.
160,Desert Exploring.,"From the moment we started and until we drove out, we were amazed by the surroundings. The rock formations were like nothing we had seen before. Everywhere we looked we loved what we saw. The Scull rock, the forest of Joshua's and the cacti garden were the highlights of our day. We spent a slow paced 3 1/2 hour trip around the park. It was well worth the trip from Palm Springs, where we were staying."
161,Beautiful & check for private events not advertised before you stop at the observatory,Went to Joshua Tree and mostly drove though but did stop and do the 1 mile loop at Barkers dam.  Was a pretty easy hike and very pleasant at this time of year.  After drive down to the Cholla cactus garden.  These are called jumping cacti because if you get too close to one it sends their needles flying right at you.  There is a first aid kit at the front of the garden with tweezers if you need one to pull out the spikes.  Desert us very beautiful at sunset and if you camp there you are sure to get a star studded sky.
162,Joshua Tree National Park,"Although it was very hot when we visited well over 100 degrees on a lovely September day, this park was very beautiful, clean and all areas very well maintained. It wasn't over crowded and we could take our time driving and looking around. Would defininitely go back as we missed the east side of the park."
163,Beautiful,Visited this park while on holidays.  It provided a lot of places to stop and see a lot of different types of views and scenery as well as some very interesting rock formations.  A must see if you are in the area.
164,Visually stunning,"This year Joshua Tree is experiencing a super bloom! Gorgeous. I went rock climbing as usual, and also did a short hike."
165,Awesome National Park,"Easy to navigate stop in the welcome center for great maps and local advice from knowledgeable park rangers.No signage on a private event in the evening at the observatory though, was a bit disappointed."
166,Every National Park is special in their own way,"The landscape here is endlessly engaging - a great example of how varied and beautiful the desert can be. While the rock formations are not as vividly colorful as some we've seen, their warm, rosy colors are pleasing; and the way the boulders have accumulated in piles and been weathered by time is amazing - they look sculpted and almost like huge giants at times.The Joshua trees themselves add to this strange landscape. We hiked Hidden Valley, an interesting trail with a neat history (1 hour, very busy); and Skull Rock - great rock sculptures and fun observing the rock climbers."
167,The best NP we visited!,"This was our second visit to Joshua Tree National Park, and it is truly amazing! The beautiful rock formations and Joshua Trees in a beautiful desert setting is a must see for anyone visiting the area. We took several hikes and saw some of the most stunning scenery. You will want to make sure you have plenty of water while hiking, even in the winter months. The drive through the park is easy, and scenery is stunning. Do take advantage of all the stops along the way."
168,Amazing location!,Came with daughter and granddaughter.  I am an experienced hiker that usually hikes in Colorado.  When I saw pictures of this park I wasn’t expecting much. I had fun and we did several of the smaller hikes with the 6 year old granddaughter.  Kids love this probably more than adults because of all the neat places to climb.  The scenery looks like you are on a different planet. Take plenty of water.
169,Gorgeous National Park,"Although the park got its name after Joshua tree and there are plenty of them and they are really beautiful I think the most interesting there are rock formations. Unfortunately we only dedicated half a day for the park on our road trip through California, which was just enough for driving from one side to another with several stops for a short walk and taking pictures. But this place definitely deserve more attention and I hope to come back soon and spend more time on hiking there."
170,A must see to experience life in a desert,"We were blown away with the stunning, natural beauty of this National Park! We earmarked an entire day and used all of it to really explore the park. We had very cold temperatures (low 40's) but we dressed for it and what was key is that we had a clear day with good sun for picture taking. There are many great spots to hike but do not miss Hidden Valley, it was our favorite and was full of breath-taking beauty! There is no place in the park for food so be sure to bring a lunch and snacks/water, and also be sure to have a full tank of gas as there are no places to get gas inside or nearby. Grab a map (which are not that great) from the visitor's center and explore this place!"
171,Scenic Desert Drive,"My husband and I spent 3 hours driving around the south of the Park, exploring the beauty of the wilderness. We made quite a few stops to take some photographs and just listen to the pure silence. We drove from the West Entrance to Hidden Valley, Keys View, (which is wheelchair accessible), Jumbo Rocks, Skull Rock, Cholla Cactus Garden and left via the Cottonwood Visitor Centre. The Park is wonderfully well maintained and very easy to navigate with helpful 'exhibit ahead' signs with good warning to allow you to pull in. Flushing toilets are located at all entrances, and very basic non-flushing toilets are available throughout the park. Picnic areas are very clean. There is no mobile/cell phone reception in the park so be sure to fill up your car with petrol and take the essentials, (walking shoes/trainers and water). The walking we did was not onerous but we did feel the heat - perhaps not helped from the jumping in/out of the air conditioned jeep! We we not sure whether to visit, not knowing how easy and enjoyable the drive would be. I would thoroughly recommend a visit."
172,Something for everyone,"I am forever in love with the magic that is Joshua Tree. There is no place like it. This desert is filled with beauty no matter where you turn. The rock formations themselves are incredible, and I spent hours playing and climbing among them.  There are numerous hiking trails to explore, filled with all kinds of Joshua Trees, cacti, and plants. But the true magic hour is when the sun starts to set. Watching the sky turn to a gorgeous pink and pure purple is incredible. Follow this up with a sky full of stars, and it is quite awe inspiring. If you like to star watch, I would recommend reading up on the constellations because they are so clear it is fun to point them out as well as be lucky enough to see a shooting stars."
173,Fantastic unforgettable trip,"Now I’ve been to Yosemite, Zion, Grand Canyon- they are what you would expect from national parks. Joshua Tree is so different. It’s desert. The plant life therefore is different, it’s sparse it’s barren yet it’s beautiful. The unique Joshua Tree is also kind of funky. There is a visitor centre but only takes about five minutes of your time. All in all if you are travelling from California towards somewhere like the Grand Canyon hen it’s worth a look. I wouldn’t make a special trip though."
174,A must go to if visiting Palm Springs,"Camping and hiking in the park, if you are an early bird you’ll manage the heat and access great hikes!  Hiking times provided by park are for sedentary people so if you are mildly active you can access great locations such as Mt. Ryan, Lost horse mine loop (the 2nd third of the trail, past the mine is the best part!) and Split rock loop are must sees!"
175,Wonderful visit ,"Spent all day, then enjoyed laying in the desert seeing the Milkey Way clearly above us! Highly recommend bringing your own map.  The one given to you by the rangers doesn't show all the places to explore.  This made planning our day difficult.  We knew what we wanted to see, just didn't know where it was."
176,Desert Wonderland ,I thought this park would be bland I and uninteresting. I was Wrong.  I had a fun time looking at this very unusual park that is one of a kind. Lots of big boulders and rocks everywhere with Joshua trees that are very strange looking. Go give it a check you should like it.
177,Please we visited,Great scenes.  We had a beautiful day and all enjoying doing some easy short hikes.  Really recommend taking advantage of the free roadrunner shuttle for free admission to park and to avoid parking hassles in park.
178,Oh my oh my!,All national parks are unique and beautiful in their own way but this one is truly worth a visit.  The Joshua tree is a funny looking tree but very photogenic!  The views in the park are amazing.  We even saw Big horn sheep!
179,What a gem.,"On a cool, overcast day we visited this park and spent three hours seeing only a small portion of this peaceful, beautiful dessert landmark. We’re glad we came: the $ 30 entry fee (north entrance) was a bargain for this well preserved open space. Our stops at the Cholla Gardens, Skull Rock and Hidden Valley were all uniquely amazing. It’s a haven for rock climbers. Restrooms were clean and easy to find en route and rangers were helpful. Cell phone internet service was only intermittently available  inside the park throughout our visit."
180,Such a diverse park- the Mojave and Colorado deserts provide quite a landscape,"The park has many short walks to very interesting places;  a huge number of mapped climbs; and some longer challenging hikes. The Cottonwood Springs side features a real oasis at Cottonwood Springs; an amazing cholla garden; and beautiful camping at White Tanks.  The entire park has a plethora of roadside exhibits, all with appropriate photo ops, explaining the Geology, climate and vegetation. The Northern side has lots of boulder formations a d Joshua trees. The unpaved roads  were a chance to be surrounded by the Joshua trees.  Keys view is a great spot for sunsets,  butgo early as it is well known and gets crowded. Black Canyon offers an easy/moderate 1.3 mile hike or a more challenging 6 miler with 360 degree views. Kudos to the Visitors centers as well,  we enjoyed each one. Don't  be fooled by the gift shop across from the Joshua Tree visitor's center: better prices at the real visitor's center."
181,Roadtrip,"This high desert park is a beautiful place with many different rock formations, beautiful flowers and all kinds of vegetation that are native to this part of the country. There is hiking, camping, rock climbing and other activities. Our tour guide Ron - ""Captin Ron"" from Big Wheel Tours is an excellent guide with vast knowledge of the park. He is very personable and he had some treats and water ready for us. Our timing was perfect when we came to visit in April. The weather was nice, sunny and cool. Highly recommend visit in the springtime!"
182,Beautiful and very special,It would be hard to come to the desert and leave this place out.  The scenery is beautiful and there is much to do.  You can hike and sightsee to your heart's content.
183,Different perspective ,Enjoy this amazing landscape and capture the most interesting and beautiful scenery. An easy drive with plenty of stopping points with places of interest well signed.
184,Just Outstanding!,No word to describe it The Force of Nature. Hidden Valley is a punch in the face. This is one of the rare places aknowledged as an official desert. This is one of the sceneries that make the United States such a special country.
185,I want more of this place,"Were vacationing (our first time) in Palm Springs, and despite the partial govt shutdown, were determined to see Joshua Tree.  It did NOT disappoint.  Drove about an hour from La Quinta to the West Entrance, where of course we were able to drive right in (would been happy to have NO shutdown, and paid the $30 fee, but that wasn't an option).  Stopped multiple times for quick walks/lots of pics, in particular at Skull Rock.  We basically did a loop of the northern part of the park, and as I say it was beautiful.  Clear sunny day, but very cold and pretty windy in places.  The pit/vault toilets were open, and we were there before things started to get pretty messy, so we were fortunate.  Hope to be back someday, LOVED it"
186,Brilliant,We drove from Vegas to Palm desert and traveled through the park. The views were spectacular! We took our time traveling through and checking out different parts of the park. The park itself was very well kept and the roads around the park are in perfect shape. The cactus were also flowering everywhere. Such amazing beauty.
187,Joshua Trees are Awesome,"Happy to say I can now check this one off my list of national parks! We especially enjoyed the cholla cactus garden at sunrise, Keys view, and taking in some sunset silhouettes. One day here was just perfect! We even saw a rad snake!"
188,Just as good second time around,I am happy to report Joshua Tree National Park located in Joshua Tree California is once again officially open after an historical closure due to the Covid shut down.Joshua Tree National Park is really beautiful with an historical abundance of blooms and scenery!Its great to have Joshua Tree National Park open again!
189,Keys Ranch Private Tour,"Kind of amazing. You just got to go and see it, enjoy nature and appreciate how old the earth really is. I was lucky to have my son with me and he is a geologist. You can spend most of the day there if you like. Be prepared for no cell service, but who needs that when you are supposed to be enjoying mother nature?"
190,Nice drive,We just spent a day at Joshua Tree NP. It is a park more geared towards hikers and rock climbers. To really appreciate the park you need to take the many hikes in the park. We did a couple of short ones. There is not much that you can see if you just drive the loop in the park. Skull Rock is just off the road and a cool rock formation. But you would need to hike to enjoy the beauty that the park offers. Definitely visit the park if you are in southern California. Definitely hope to go back sometime and explore the park more in depth.
191,A wonder of nature,"This is an expansive park that would take all day just to drive the main roads and take a few of the short hikes.  I spent almost four days here and did lots of hiking, which is really the way to see this desert park.  The scenery is interesting as the park contains portions of two deserts (Sonoran and Mojave) and a number of rock formations.  Wildlife is at a minimum--in four days I saw one coyote, a few jackrabbits and more honey bees that I cared to see--that's it.  The most interesting hikes take you to the remains of the area's mining history--Lost Horse Mine and Wall Street Mine are the best.  Hidden Valley and Barker's Dam are short hikes into rock formations and worthwhile.  If you have some stamina, the hike to 49 Palms Oasis is spectacular.  The visitor centers are minimal but helpful in terms of getting maps and info.  Joshua Tree is not Yellowstone or even Death Valley but it is well worth a visit if you are driving between L.A. and Phoenix"
192,Gorgeous,"I was somewhat wary about visiting the park after hearing the story’s on the national news about the park (and trees) being damaged during the latest government shutdown, but thankfully I didn’t see any of the damage they reported (go figure).  This is a diverse park, and there is enough variety of things to see to please almost anyone.  I particularly liked the Joshua trees, but the truth is they are everywhere in the town of Joshua Tree and the area surrounding the town.  If that is all you are interested in seeing, you can save the price of admission.Parts of two deserts and a change in altitude make for a great variety of things to see.  For me the boulder sections with the Joshua Trees was very scenic, and likely my favorite feature.  And if you drive out to “Keys View” on a clear day you can see a long way."
193,Beautiful,"Simple a wonderful place for a British tourist - there's so much to see in the way of geography, geology and views across the desert.It's a shame we had only two hours for a quick drive in the park (cost $25.00!) but it was worth the money.  This place is worthy of a two-day trip.Do take water, do ensure your fuel tank has enough!"
194,An incredible drive!,We drove from the south entrance to the north entrance.  You will see how the desert changes from Sonoran to Mojave desert in a short distance.  The Joshua trees are interesting and the entire park is fascinating.
195,Wow,"Everybody should go to Joshua Tree, it is a fantastic place, this year was so rainy that there are flowers right now"
196,Beautiful park with great trails.,Wow what a magical place to visit. It has a unique beauty and energy and has such spacious quietness - you feel worlds away from life in LA here!!Highly recommend visiting this park
197,Unique and interesting national park,"My sister and I took a picture on the road leading into the park, posing as roadkill in the desert, since there was no one there. The joshua trees are very cool and look beautiful in the vast desert. It's also fun to go climb skull rock. Disapointed I didn't see any tortoises. This visit was in November of 2012, not 2019"
198,Hike to experience the park,When we visited we started at the visitor center at the west entrance and got quick education and to pick up a map and use the restrooms. We had been told there were no concessions in the park and to bring lots of water. We had several liters of water with us just in case as we were going to drive from one end to the other.I am glad we picked up the map as it showed us places to stop or take a quick hike. Not really much to see here however the view from Keys view is pretty spectacular so make sure you go see that. The other places you pass by you do see some interesting trees and rock formations. I am glad I saw this national park but doubt if I would pay to go back it's just not my cup of tea. Just heed the warnings and take water and food with you but pack it out.
199,The Wall Street hike is perfect and level!,"I stayed in Santa Clara and traveled to Joshua Tree (Long drive). I love driving so decided to drive down Joshua Tree National Forest. I stared at 4 am and reached Joshua Tree at 12.00 noon. We paid the park entry fee at the entrance which is applicable for multiple entry for a week but it is not transferable. We explored all around Joshua Tree park whole day did couple of hiking like Lost Horse Mine (Old Gold Mine), Barker Dam, Arch Rock, Warren Peak. By evening we enjoyed the sunset and came back to Joshua city. We stayed in home stay which was good and cheaper. Next day morning we went to Choulla cactus garden to see sun rise view around   6 am. it is must visit place and let we did hiking  next day till noon and started back to Santa Clara."
200,Loved Joshua Tree,Unique scenery. Trails could be better marked. Unused trails were hard to navigate because of vegetation and lack of trail markers. Lines at the gate were bothersome when 2nd lane wasn’t opened for season pass holders. I used the 29 Palms entrance every day. Vault toilets were best maintained that I’ve every seen.Trail guides could have been better. Park was clean and well maintained.Fantastic hiking on 31 trails listed in guide and 40 Classic Day hikes purchased at the visitor center. The staff member who helped me check out wasn’t very friendly at 29 Palms. The staff at Joshua Tree visitor center was very kind when I bought the season pass.
201,Always amazing!,"While traveling to LA we knew we wanted to see a National Park. The National Park closest to where we were traveling was Joshua Tree. While driving to Joshua Tree we wondered if we made the right choice, due to the boring landscape of the desert. However, when you're actually in the park the views are incredible. We hiked up part of Ryan Mountain then climbed some boulders within the park. We didn't have much time as it was close to sunset when we got there.  Definitely gorgeous and fun to visit."
202,Magnificent National Park,"On a beautiful clear day we visited Joshua Tree National Park, a veritable jewel of the National Park system.  We spent about three hours seeing only a small portion of this peaceful, beautiful dessert landmark of well preserved desert vegetation and unique open space. It’s an amazingly inviting haven for rock climbers and certainly for hikers of all abilities. Restrooms were clean and easy to find en route and rangers were helpful.  I wish we had been able to take advantage of a ranger-led hike.Just in case; cell phone internet service was never available inside the park throughout our visit."
203,Great Hiking & rock scrambling ,"If one enjoys desert scenery, this park is for you.  The displays are excellent in identifying and explaining the vegetation present.  Hiking trails are clearly marked.  If you choose to - bring A LOT of water."
204,Amazingly beautiful,"Became known to me through the album of U2, and the typical vegetation is indeed the image of this park. Rode through it to have first idea of desert zones with also some rock formations."
205,Good national park,"We were staying over 75 miles away from Joshua Tree NP but decided to take a day trip into the park. I'm so glad we did as it is amazing. You'll see plenty of Joshua trees, which are unusual, as well as massive boulders in a desert atmosphere. If you go in the summer, plan to spend time in the park early in the morning because of the desert heat. We got there around 8 am, hiked Hidden Valley trail, went to Keys View and then drove the scenic Park Blvd past Skull Rock to Twenty-nine Palms."
206,Great April visit,I made a one day road trip here from San Diego: you really must visit this park if you are in this area of California. Being from the Midwest- we do not have this type of geography. Naturally it is very hot.   Your first stop has to be at the visitors center. They have many resources and exhibits there that will answer and explain any questions you might have about this national park. There are many types of plant & wildlife  that you seldom see in other environments. It will be hard to see it all in just one day.
207,Springtime at Joshua Tree National Park,"I expected to see a lot of Joshua Trees but they were scattered and this was not the place to experience it all. There were some huge ones. We didn't have enough time to experience all this park had to offer but the rock formations were rather interesting. You could spend hours climbing them, taking pictures and going to every stop to see the next set of rocks. We will do this again for sure with more time and hope to see the rest of the park in depth."
208,Super bloom visit was amazing,"Spent a day driving around and stopping at various points to do some brief strolls. It is very beautiful but in September a mile walk felt quite tough with temperatures well into the 30s. Some of the highlights such as the skull rock weren't particularly impressive but it was lovely just to see the landscape as a whole.Went back after dark to do some star photography and it was just stunning, a mile into the park you can't see a single electric light so it's perfect for this."
209,Amazing experience!,"We were able to visit Joshua Tree National Park for a couple of days in July. We were honestly warned away from visiting that month due to the heat, but we didn't have a choice and decided to make the best of it. And it was an incredible experience. Here's what we did: Day 1 - we arrived just as the sun was setting and decided to go get some pictures. The place was beautiful and I was so excited to get back the next day and do some exploring. We entered through the West entrance. Day 2 - we got out to the park right at sunrise and felt such awe at the sight. We drove through the park for awhile and did the Barker Dam and Arch Rock hikes, stopped at Skull Rock, and a few other stop offs for some pictures. We left around 10:30a as it started to get pretty warm. We came back around 5:30p and headed for the Hidden Valley hike (recommended by a person at the Visitor Center, who was so helpful), went up to Keys View, and wrapped up at a densely packed area of Joshua Trees for the sunset. I would absolutely go back any time of year. It was beautiful and so much fun. My husband felt like he was a kid again scrambling the boulders. Bring sunscreen, water, snacks, and a hat though!"
210,Gotta go!,"This is one of the highlights of our roadtrip to JTNP. The view is amazing overlooking the desert, valley, and mountains."
211,A very “Wild West” movie style desert park,"Magnificent place to visit. We arrived mid May and the peak season had just finished. No waiting anywhere and still saw a fairmbitmof snow on higher peaksmin the distance. Will,post photos when we are home end of June."
212,"Very interesting park, don't miss it.","A nice park, well worth visiting if in the area.Lots of parking spaces available, along with a few vantage points here and there suitable for taking a few pictures."
213,Joshua tree,"From the minute you enter the park you are surrounded by beauty. The Joshua Tree is a bit further up in the park but once you hit them they are everywhere. There are many points of interest to stop at to go hiking and some hikes are longer then others but all astonishing. The colors are amazing. So many picture opportunities. It's $30.00 per car to enter the park or free for active military. Make sure you bring a lot of water to drink in the summer months because you are after all in the Mojave desert. The weather can change at the different altitudes so a jacket might even be neccessary. Also, highly recommend bug spray."
214,Fulfills the promise of a National Park - stunning vistas,"It was a wonderful experience to visit this national park. Unlike many parks where you are likely to see so many people, this place is very peaceful and beautiful. Sometimes, you may have the entire trail to yourself. Take a gentle walk, have a picnic and take some photos so that you will be able to go back and to remember such a delightful place. Make sure that you have plenty of water and also be careful to walk in the shaded area as you may encounter some creatures, such as, snakes, as they also like to stay in a cooler place during the early afternoon sun. Highly recommended."
215,Great National Park,"As on prior visits, Joshua Tree did not disappoint. The hills that seem like humongous piles of huge granite golden-hued boulders, often precariously balanced, stand out beautifully against the blue sky and present new surprising views as you explore around them. Don't miss Hidden Valley where you are totally surrounded by these amazing sights. And the Joshua Trees themselves are very photogenic as well! Don't skip this park when you're in the Palm Springs area."
216,Very nice park,"the park is so big, but it doesn't makes you feel like everything look the same. there are so much to see, from animals - if you are lucky, rocks, trees, and other vegetations. it's a long drive from one place to other, but it is wroth it! I see quite a number of people camp in the park. I wish I had enough time to do so. the weather is very typical desert weather, cold in the morning and after sunset, but can be very hot in the mid day, so make sure bring a jacket with you, I will suggest thicker than a light jacket as it can be a bit windy form time to time depends on where you at. it's also recommenced to go for a short hike where ever you fancy, just need to make sure you have a proper shoes as the rocks can be slippery with morning mist. I can't wait to go visit again soon!"
217,Wildflowers,There  is a reason why Joshua tree was elevated to National Park status a few years ago...it is spectacular!! Make sure you visit the ranger station at the west park entrance for maps and infor.  Don't miss Hidden Canyons...easy walk for everyone and you get to see some incredible rock formations.  Remember that the elevation is higher here if you are coming from the palm springs area...bring a sweater!!  This is a day trip so alot enough time for the lookout at sunset! Go to Pappy and Harriet's in pioneer town afterwards for the ending to a perfect day!  Check their website for hours!! Enjoy!!
218,Wonderful and a must see,"What an amazing spot!We loved to enjoy the beautiful landscape. The park was not busy, so on some spots we were nearly allone."
219,So diverse,"Joshua Tree has a magical feeling that is hard to describe. It is worth the drive through the desert to get here. An auto day pass is $25 or an annual one is $80 available at the visitor center if you want to avoid purchasing in line. Once inside, you'll get a map highlighting all the different places to stop through the park with miles of hiking trails at each one. Skull Rock at the Jumbo Rocks, Barker Dam, and a drive down to the Cholla cactus patch are must do's for each of my visits. Keep your eyes peeled for quail, road runners, lizards and gray foxes. The tortoise love shade so look under trees for those elusive guys. There are bunnies everywhere. Basically, floppy ears frolicking at every turn. The rocks are beautiful and climbable at most stops. Hiking shoes are recommended as the trails are covered in soft sand and the views are worth it from the rocks. There are restrooms at most of the parking lot stops which make it very convenient. This national park is nicely organized so please visit if you haven't already done so. I've come in the heart of the summer where it's really hot- bring lots of water (since none is sold in the park) and sunscreen since the only shade is mostly in your car. There's a fun park ranger program where you pick up a booklet from the visitor center to mark off the items to search for. After finding the items, you submit the book for a ranger badge that includes a cute ceremony for kids. Thank you rangers for keeping our parks beautiful!"
220,Always fun.,We were able to view a good deal of Joshua Tree NP by simply driving through. There are plenty of places to stop and get out to make great photos of the eerily beautiful trees and rock formations this park is known for.
221,Trip back in time to the Flinstones.,"My husband and I spent about 3 hours here and loved it.  It is different from many other National Parks that we have visited.  We entered via the north entrance ($30/car) and picked where we wanted to stop and hike along the way.  Plan to bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and snacks/food.   There are no services in the park (there are pit toilets).  The north side of the park is much more interesting than the south side, but the park is composed of two different deserts.  It was difficult to find parking at some locations, but we went on a Saturday.  Definitely put this on your to-do list!"
222,One of my most favorite places in California!,"Although the views out the car window or along the side of the road are beautiful enough, this park should be hiked to be appreciated.   Many of the hikes are easy, but once you climb up a couple boulders or identify a few different types of cacti, you'll yearn for more.  If you can only do one hike...do Hidden Valley."
223,"Very cool, and very accessible","We appreciate the incredible beauty of the multiple Joshua Trees and rock formations in Joshua Tree National Park, but are most enchanted with Hidden Valley.  The total walk from start to end in Hidden Valley is only about 3/4 of a mile, but you are up and down throughout the journey.  As you walk, you see not only natural beauty - with well thought out explanations of your vistas, but you also see rock climbers in their ascents that appear a bit treacherous to those still on the ground.   You want to cheer them onwards, but hesitate less your applause takes needed attention away from the task at hand.This time, we also saw Joshua Tree's growth from pods to fruition.  They are quite beautiful."
224,One hour outside of Palm Desert.,"Must take a trip thru the park. We drive thru with the help of a great map from the visitor center  Clean park, lots to see from all sides of the car. Our favorites were skull rock (all the rock formations actually!) Keys Lookout, the large rocks where we we're lucky to see actual people climbing with gear up the steep, slick sides of the rocks along with a few already on the tops resting from their climb. STAY on the paths if hiking and take at least 2 more bottles of water per person than you think you will need!"
225,Beautiful scenery,"Keys Ranch is a must see at the Park. You must call ahead for reservations. Puts the Joshua Tree History into perspective. The area was once used for cattle ranching and there are approximately 200 abandoned gold mines in the park.Keys View is a must see also. You can see Palm Springs, the Salton Sea and Mexico. If you're a hiker and have a 4 wheel drive the Squaw Tank trail is for you. Other hikes not requiring a 4 wheel drive are Barker Dam, Hidden Valley and Ryan Mountain. Bring water since there is none available inside the park. And remember to stay on the trails."
226,Incredible,This is s large park and very popular during the cooler time of the year.  Many trails and campgrounds.  Many succulent plants including the iconic Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia).  Large granite boulders abound making for very scenic landscapes.  Picnic areas are also available.
227,Incredible Beauty,"We loved Joshua Tree National Park. It was the last stop on our week-long road trip, so my husband was a bit restless, but once we got to the Cholla Cactus Garden and Skull Rock, he was having a great time. We started from the south entrance of the park, and while it was a beautiful drive, we wish we started at the northern side of the park. Most of the dense Joshua Tree areas are in the north side. We first stopped at Cholla Cactus Garden where there is an insane amount of these massive cacti all around you. There is an easy walking path so you can walk among these beautiful plants. We then continued to drive north and got out of the car at Skull Rock. We were able to climb the rocks and see all of the Joshua trees around. It is a really cool place to explore and the rocks go on for what seems like miles. It was really hot when we were there, and I think in the two hours or so that we explored, we probably went through four or five water bottles. We ended up driving the rest of the way and didn't do any hikes, but there were so many options of places to explore."
228,"Expensive entrance fee.  If your a senior, be sure and use your National Park card for free admittance","$30 for a weeks pass for one vehicle, or multiple national park annual pass available. Stunning drives through hills and valleys with the unique Joshua trees. Park can be entered from the North or south, with various walking , cycling and driving routes. Hidden valley had memorable rock formations and areas to have a picnic. The views from the summit over to palm springs and the san andreas fault are breathtaking."
229,What a walk,"My friends come out here to visit from San Diego , Sacramento and Huntington Beach and love going into the park.  It is like being on another planet, the rock outcroppings are unbelievably gorgeous.  The park is so clean.  You will meet people from all over the world out here.  They come from every corner of the globe to visit Joshua Tree."
230,See the whole park,"Jumbo Rocks, including Skull Rock, is a great area to walk and climb.  Barkers Dam was also a great hike (1 mile loop).  There are great scenic driving roads within the park.  Just remember that services are extremely limited and temperatures can be hot, so bring what you need, both food and water.    And don't forget the fascinating Joshua Trees!  They are unique."
231,Easy day trip from PS ,Fantastic desert scenery that can be seen in about a one hour driving tour. Stop off at several good hiking trails and scenic lookouts.
232,"Magical place, 2,5 hours drive from L.A","My husband had done some research before we took a little side trip to Joshua Tree National Park.  He had chosen the Split Rock loop for a nice 2 mile round trip hike.  We stopped at the Visitor's Center before entering the park and I'm glad we did.  It was very helpful to get some information about how the Joshua trees, how the park came to be, and some info about the actual formations.  I'd strongly recommend a stop there before entering the park.On the drive to the hike, we saw many, many very interesting rock formations.  It was fun to imagine what they looked like - rocks on the moon?  Faces?  The skyline of a big city? The Split Rock loop wasn't as easy to find as we'd hoped but it was worth it.  The hike is fairly easy, the views incredible, the trails mostly well-marked.  So many pictures to take..."
233,Excellent,"This place is beautiful, but vast! We drove the 'loop', but should have turned around because we had a long drive home! Give yourself an entire day (or two) to appreciate the wilderness and beauty. I hope to return to hike!"
234,Stunning scenery,"Joshua Tree National Park is a wonderful place to visit.  The Joshua Tree, along with many other species of plants and animals, are only found in the park and surrounding area -- the Joshua Tree grows only at a specific elevation and is not seen at the lower elevations of the park.  Some of our favorite activities here included:  stopping all along the road to take photos of the Joshua Trees, stopping at Skull Rock and climbing some of the rocks around it, driving up to Keys View (a high elevation area with an amazing view of the valley below -- we visited once early in the day and then again for sunset), hiking at Hidden Valley (one mile -- a great hike, but although the literature says it is easy, there are lots of steps up and down on irregular rock steps), and stopping in at the visitor centers. I think that if you aren't doing much hiking, you could see most of the major things here in one long day (we like to start early when we visit the national parks), or you could pace yourself a little slower (or do a longer hike) and take two days.  The Joshua Trees are not to be missed!"
235,Large park,"This was the last point on our journey through the deep southwest starting at Saguaro NP, then Organ Pipe Cactus NM, and ending here at Joshua Tree NP. I would absolutely definitely recommend this trip to those who want the complete desert experience.We started at the south entrance and spent 1 day in the park, eventually exiting out the west entrance to the park. This was a great way to visit the park as we got to see the entire length of the park. After going in through I-10, and after visiting the Cottonwood Visitor Center, we casually drove on the main road through the far reaches of the park. This part of the park was vast, and since we were here in March, there were flowers everywhere. The desert was definitely in bloom and I would highly recommend visiting this time of year when the weather is relatively cool and everything is in bloom. One thing that is relatively scarce in this part of the park is Joshua trees.Our first stop was the Cholla Cactus Garden, a complete forest of ""jumping cactus"" We walked around the little nature trail through the Chollas being very careful to both taunt the cactus and to respect the cactus at the same time. Very neat! Since we only had one day, we had to pick and choose the sites and trails we wanted to do. So we drove slowly through the park on the main road. Eventually we got to the more central part of the park, and there were amazing Joshua trees everywhere. This was a completely different experience...similar to the cactus forests back in Saguaro NP. We stopped to take pictures of the tallest Joshua tree in the park there in the Queen Valley Forest, but we just drove past Jumbo Rocks and Ryan Mountain. Jumbo Rocks was a place full of enormous rocks that looked like a fun place for younger people to play. Ryan Mountain Trail appeared to be one continuous stream of people (including little kids) hiking up the trail like a stream of army ants. Too crowded...so we skipped it as well. Instead, we took the long drive up the mountain to Keys View. After finding a parking place (pretty crowded), we took the little hike up to the lookout (paved) and spent a good half hour to 45 minutes just enjoying the views. It is pretty spectacular from up here, and we could see all the way to the Salton Sea and the Palm Springs. We could also see the great vastness and great beauty of this desert.After heading down the mountain, we stopped at the trail head for the Hidden Valley Trail. We decided to hike this trail as it was only a 1 mile loop, and was highly recommended. We were not disappointed. The trail went quickly up through some large boulders, and then descended into the ""Hidden Valley"". Very nice hike...very peaceful, lots of things to see, very diverse flora with the Joshua trees, but also several other types of tress. And then there were the boulders. Lots of rock climbers were there. Very nice hike.At this point we really needed some solitude. The central part of the park was really crowded with cars and people--much more so than I would have thought out here in the desert. Must be all those people from LA trying to escape their miserable existence. Lucky for us, we were able to find a wonderfully peaceful and isolated place to enjoy the rest of the afternoon. We drove out to the Barker Dam area and then continued on the dirt road (I think it's called the Queen Valley Road. Almost immediately we were all alone in an extensive forest of Joshua trees for as far as the eye could see. We even stopped a few times and got out to take short hikes into the rocks/forest and enjoy the peace and take pictures. We drove all the way through on this road until we came back out on the main road. We then got to drive through the central part of the park again, enjoying all the really cool sights along the way, finally exiting at the west entrance.I cannot begin to express how absolutely amazing the desert is...especially in march. I highly recommend Joshua Tree NP and look forward to being able to come back again and do some hiking..."
236,Breathtaking ,"Joshua Tree is a wonderful day trip from Los Angeles. Stop in the town of Joshua Tree for lunch and a wander and buy yourself hats and gloves in the Winter months if you’ve forgotten to bring them. It was 30 degrees when we visited on New Year’s Day and the park had no services because of the shutdown. We didn’t see anyone acting up, but there were rumors of idiots acting up in the park and harming the trees. Why?! It is a profoundly beautiful and haunting place and everyone we came across seemed overjoyed to be there. We went to Skull Rock and it was a great place to see the sunset and wander through the rocks So Joshua Tree on New Year’s Day...I swear we didn’t plan to have a U2 themed day, but there we were, a song and an album. Perfect day."
237,A great national park,"After flying into Palm Springs, renting a car and visiting with grandkids for a couple of days in Twentynine Palms, we set out on Day 3 or our 14 day road trip. First stop was the visitor center to get some maps and some points of interest to stop at on the way south. Beautiful desert views on the drive down to Cottonwood Visitor Center where you can take a side road to the oasis. They have it roped off to stay on the trails so please do. Lots of opportunities for good plant photos and landscape photos."
238,Stunning!!,Spring is definitely the time to go to Joshua Tree.  Everything was just starting to bloom and this year the desert was particularly green and the weather was perfect.
239,Cool & Freezing,"Joshua Tree is a wonderful place if you seek solitude in very special surroundings. A pleasant 15 minute drive from the North Entrance brings you to a rocky ‘Wonderland’. Then once you walked about 100m from your car it can feel like you are the only person on a strange and beautiful planet. There are the obvious, well signposted spots and hikes like Hidden Valley, Skull Rock and Baker Dam which can have enough day visitors to fill up the parking lots and get a bit too busy for my taste (the government shutdown over New Year 2018 meant that for a few days they were actually overflowing). However, I just followed some paths leading off from Hidden Valley and the Lost Horse service road to various climbing areas, then did some easy scrambling to the “Real Hidden Valley” and was all alone again in no time. There are lots of photo opportunities of curiously shaped trees, cacti and rocks. Extreme weather/temperature differences from day to day or even day to night made sure that it stayed interesting: one day I had snow dusted cactus with ominous dark clouds in the background and the next provided glaring sun and crystal-clear skies. Most days I started my hikes from the small gravel lot at the Service road to Lost Horse. There is no sign post at this dirt road and there are mostly only climbers parked here. I got chatting with one of them and the next day we roped up together for the neat single pitch climb Cake Walk (5.8). Very satisfying to top out on one of those huge rock piles. Another day I bouldered up to just under the top of Aiguille de Joshua Tree. Felt a little too exposed to go all the way but a fellow climber was kind enough to go all the way so I could take a photo of this iconic boulder problem.Camping in the park was first limited and then not allowed at all after New Year due to the government shutdown but I managed to stay at Ryan campsite for one lovely night (see my review on Tripadvisor for that). For the rest of my 9-day trip I had to make the 20 minute drive out of the park each night to camp; a little disappointing but ok since I took the opportunity to have a hot 7-minute shower for $5 at the Joshua Tree National Park Store most days.I mentioned the temperature differences already. It really can get freezing at nighttime. A chilly wind made me wish I had a better and thicker sleeping bag. It is also worthwhile mentioning that even in winter the desert air is crazy dry and you need will your water and lip balm."
240,Stunning,"This place was so boring. If I was a poopologist, I would study this poophole of a park. I really wonder how it became a national park. Really makes me wonder how low the standards are."
241,Very Cool,"2 couples spent 2 day hiking and climbing throughout the park. You can chose level of difficulty. Enjoyed it tremendousley. Beautifully exciting country. Had a guide from Joshua Tree excursions for first day. She was great, her name is Anuk. Very knowledgeable about the area. Shoqed up places we probably would not have found on iur own. Also, outlined on a map spwcial spots to visit on our own. Friendly guide, lovely personMoishe"
242,Beautiful scenery,We came for Spring Break with our teenage boys and were amazed at all the things to do here! It was easily navigated well marked and plenty of options to please everyone. We hiked over 14 miles of trails in 2 days. What an adventure and great memories made!
243,This Place is Fantastic!,This is a beautiful place to visit if you're ever nearby... nature at it's best! We loved seeing all the different plants and rocks around here and even managed to get a few small quartz to take home as a memory.
244,A wonderful day in the high desert,"I lived in Joshua Tree in the late 1970's when the population was lower and the National Park was just a National Monument. Then as now the now justly famous Joshua Tree National Park offered majestic vistas and real honest to goodness solitude. It is delightfully still the case, especially if you go there at low season. Places to hike like The Boy Scout Trail, Lost Palm Oasis and Geology Tour Road are hard to find in this busy world. But in Joshua Tree it is still possible to get way out there, miles from a trail head, without seeing another soul for hours. The Joshua trees, yuccas, and cholla abound, and rabbits and hares hop about. You can hear coyote pups, and various birds will take keen notice of your presence.Joshua Tree National Park can help you to reinvigorate, and charge up your spiritual batteries. It is a magnificent place."
245,Great park!,"We have enjoyed this national park visit very much. Several trails are available, we have stayed after a sunset to watch stars."
246,Every season is different!,Nice area to go hiking with several trails at varying levels of difficulty. Trail we were on was sandy most of the way.  Great views at top of Warren Pass. Lot of Joshua Trees and wild life along the way. Overnight camping is also available for $20. Park was very clean.
247,Awesome visit!,"A master gardener and architect could not have designed Joshua Tree National Park with better precision. As you drive through and pull over to explore each stop along the way, you are bound to draw a similar conclusion to mine. Everything seems to be exactly where it should be. The hands of time placed each stone, every cactus, every single tree, and every plant exactly where it should be. Not only that, but it was done in a way to maximize the beauty and the environment."
248,AMAZING,"I mean i feel sorry for people who live in CA or come to CA for vacation and never visited this place. Let me say simple as this place might be more beautiful and dreamy landscape it is . I cant believe only 17 reviews and 22 pics. Like really how is this gem of place being missed bu all tourist and locals.I was in CA for really 2.5 days. We decided to take a day trip to JTNP after deciding not city touring or beaching. We were 2 couples and left Anaheim DT around 930 and got to twenty nine palms  Oasis visitor center around 11:45 after having lunch at Pizza Hut .Got our maps and proceed to the entrance where no one was there so we saved $25 right off the bat as did not need any pass for the car. We are not big hikers and were just going to do most of things while driving around. First we went straight to Arch rock. Along that way we stopped at couple exhibit and walking into the open vast land with all the joshua tree.  We parked the car on the road and hiked this .5 mile hike to Arch rock . very easy hike and good view of the surrounding rocks and vast area of park . The we moved toward the Cactus Garden. Beautiful views driving there. You see yourself descending into the Valley. The scenic drive at tis best. The cactus garden was awesome other than fact that a cactus roll decided to make it self comfortable on my cousin calf. Those things stings and hard to pull out. He leg was swelled up but little cold water and advil did the trickthen we turned around and went to all the other dif sites like jumbo rocks , skull rock etc etc ... most of them places are very easy to walk to , take some pics and move on or go take a trail and hike. We also did some offroading to an old mine bu then found out to see the ruins there was a hike so we turned back. Key Views is a definite stop for all visiting the park. Best view of the park and the valley and the town from above. We rode mostly for the 5 hours or so we there stopping here and there for pics and such. We thoroughly enjoyed this 5 hrs we were there i can only imagine if we come and camp there or stay in the town and slowly do all the hikes and see all the attractions and ruins that are accessible there by hiking how much fun it would be . we are definitely going to be back. This is is a great great place for photo shoot sunrise , sunset or Milky way you cant go wrong in this park. absolutely great place."
249,Wall Street Mill and Barkers Dam,"Fantastic park, our whole family loved the experience. We were there around Christmas  and there was a lot snow which made it even more of an incredible time. We would recommend getting there early, there was a huge line of cars waiting to gain entry to the park when we left around 12pm. We arrived around 8am. Lots of great hikes, a little more difficult in the snow. We loved it all, our kids loved it too."
250,Stunning scenery across plateau and Coachella valley,"We came to Joshua Tree from Palm Springs the day after it snowed up in the mountains. What an experience! It was so cool to see the park covered in snow. We were able to go up one of the trails that was still open. Definitely worth a visit. Make sure to bring food and water, since there are no restaurants within the park- just at the visitor's center and in the town of Joshua Tree."
251,Just LOVED the drive,Travelers heading to SFO from Interstate 10 take the time to go thru Joshua Tree National Park. It is beautiful and the drive is peaceful. If you get there early you will have the park pretty much to yourself. Later in the day it tends to be very crowded.  Stop for lunch in Joshua Tree as there are several wonderful places. Head north towards Barstow and continue a peaceful drive north to SFO.
252,Plenty to see in a day of driving,This park is worth a stop and taking a few of the hikes.  The trees are very unique and nothing you've seen anywhere else in the world. The sunsets are gorgeous here and worth going late in the day. Vault toilets but no water in the park.  Bring your own for hikes.
253,Beautiful National Park,"We were visiting Palm Springs and decided to make the short drive to Joshua Tree Natl Park.  Due to the government shutdown, the visitor center was closed.  The coffee shop next to it had a map out and a sign saying ""take a picture of our map!""  Great idea!  We entered the park and went immediately to the maze loop.  It was beautiful although very cold the day we went! (41 degrees).  We hiked the loop and only saw a few other people along the trail.  Lovely cool area!"
254,"Quiet, serne, other Earthly!","Joshua Tree National Park,located in the scenic,beautiful and historical Southern California desert community of Joshua Tree,is a world class travel and outdoor destination that is a MUST SEE visitors experience!From the beautiful and healthy desert sun and air to the fantastic rock formations and clear nite time star filled desert skys,Joshua Tree National Park is a magnificent not to be missed destination!The JTNP is perfect for a half day ""drive through"",a full day ""stop and go""picture filled ,totally ""grammable"" excursion or a camp over for the full nite time stars experience!There's lots to do at JTNP from short hikes to longer overnite hikes to exploring old mines,old historic locations and great scenic photography opportunities!A bonus for February through April visitors is the magnificent desert wild flowers!Be sure to check on each years flower blooms for up to date flower bloom info.

255,Well worth the trip,"Joshua Tree National Park is, without a doubt, one of the coolest places on planet earth! Each of the unique and precious Joshua trees seems to have its own personality.  Truly magical.  Go for sunset or sunrise!"
256,Would go back anytime,We went to the Joshua Tree National park for the day. You will find it is very large area and you can. Only see part of it in a day.We went to the hidden valley and then barkers dam trails and that was a whole day.You can drive in for a fee of $30 per car or take the bus from the 29 Palms entrance for free.Be sure to take all the food and water you need because there is basically nothing in the park
257,Hidden Valley; Hidden Treasure,"The landscape and vegetation changes so much and so quickly as you drive through the Park.  The roads appear to be recently paved and is easily li y traversed.  The Exhibit Signs off the road are well marked.  I would highly recommend using the All Trails app, if possible, to help guide you along the trails, as multiple trails could crisscross each other and there is no signage.  Nevertheless, this is a wonderful park for exploring and to marvel at the geology and plant life."
258,Joshua Trees in bloom ,"My partner and I visited Joshua tree last month. We visited north visitors center to get a map the first day. It was a very crowded center though so we had no time to ask any questions. We drove into the park and had a picnic lunch. There was no shaded picnic tables so be prepared to eat in the sun. We enjoyed the scenery very much. Incredible desert flora and fauna. The next day we hiked around the cottonwood springs and loved it! Quails, hummingbirds, bees, cacti, & a desert oasis! The cottonwood visitor center is also less crowded."
259,Spectacular,"Spent a good amount of time at the Hidden Valley trail. Probably hiked for 1 hr on the trail loop. Nice scenery and a number of climbers scaling some of the smaller rock faces. A number of picnic tables available and restrooms (latrine style) as well. From there we drove to cholla cactus garden. About 30 drive. Small garden area with plenty of cholla. Don’t stray of marked trail. Warning signs remind you about the cholla. We saw one person taking a selfie off trail and brushed against a cholla. Ouch!!!! From there driving to the south entrance, cottonwood, takes less time than traveling back north, if you are trying to get back on interstate 5. We stayed in LaQuinta and it took approx. 1 hr to get to the Joshua tree visitors center. From the Cottonwood visitors center it was about 10 minutes to Hwy 5 and then less than 30 minutes back to LaQuinta. No Joshua trees in the south end of the park."
260,More than I expected,We entered from the south gates and drove north through the park. Words are hard to describe this amazing treasure.
261,Go now for the Wildflower Super Bloom..,"What an amazing national park!  My husband and I were wowed by all the amazing geological treasures.  So many amazing rock structures and opportunities for climbing a bouldering.  We signed up for the tour of the Desert Queen Ranch which was a step back in time, seeing what life was like during pioneer/mining days.  The hiking trails were varied in length and ability level, so there was something for everyone.  Definitely put this on your must visit list and be a responsible visitor and respect the environment."
262,One of our great National Parks,This a fantastic National Park but be careful on when & where you visit. It’s super hot late spring to early Fall. It’s a desert . What little rain that falls can cause flooding. There are nature and short hikes to explore the other worldly rocks. There are long backpacks. But it’s a big park and some people have got lost and some have never been found. It’s a rock climbers dream.
263,If you like rocks and camp at night to watch stars,Unfortunately was raining a lot and at higher elevations I drove in heavy fog. I only stopped by the main road and did not do any walking or hiking. Views from the road and all interesting view points gave good feeling for the place. All different kinds of cacti plants with the king of them all: Joshua Tree. Like Saguaros in Arizona the Joshua tree is main block of ecosystem of this desert environment.
264,Joshua Tree,We only had about 2 hours but it was well worth the drive!  Picturesque and lovely to explore.  We mostly drove through but we did stop 4 times to explore very short trails.  It was definitely worth the drive.  Lots of rock formations and vegetation to admire.  Scenic panoramic and photo opportunities as well.
265,Wonderous and Amazing Joshua Tree National Park Visit in February,"Joshua Tree NP has been a park that we have missed in several previous road trips - but no this time - and so glad that we finally made it. It really is quite an unusual and extraordinary place, especially at sunset - the place takes on such ethereal beauty. We have really fallen for it - so much so, that we will return to it."
266,huge park to say the least,"Went out to Joshua tree for the first time in a while. Still absolutely so beautiful even though there are tons of people there now. It looks like the park is still been kept up very well. Keys view, hidden Valley, jumbo rocks and a few other places made for a great trip."
267,A Great place to visit,"We enjoyed driving around the very well kept park as the roads are all paved and there are several pull-off places where you can get out and explore or take pictures.  We watched several young guys scaling up the side of a very steep huge rock formation.  That was the highlight of our adventure.  The trees are beautiful but after thirty minutes of driving around, we were ready to go."
268,Pleasantly surprised,Joshua Tree National Park is absolutely beautiful and very special. We loved our time here and we had a blast. The trees of course are very cool but the rock formations are amazing.
269,Spectacular,"Joshua Tree National Park has been on my list of places to visit for a while, and the park does not disappoint. There are so many areas to explore and amazing sights and views to see. My strongest recommendations for exploration are Skull Rock and Hidden Valley. Keys View is also good for scenic shots."
270,Great drive,"We visited Joshua Tree NP around Veteran's Day. The hike up to the mine was extremely cold and seemed much longer than 4 miles. But the rest of the park, although a bit chilly, was spectacular. There were rock climbers, both experienced and beginners. There were easy hikes and difficult ones. The park is so huge you really need more than one day to experience the grandeur."
271,Spectacular ,"Like all of our national parks, Joshua Tree is well worth a visit. We spent a full day, with a little preview drive the evening before. Of course, Joshua Tree, or Giant yucca, is the unique feature you’ll see here, but driving from the Mohave Desert to the lower elevation of the Colorado Plateau leaves the Joshua Trees behind, to be replaced by groves or gardens of other cacti, all the same, as far as the eye can see. We took a ranger-led walk which informed us about the natural ecology and pointed out part of an earthquake fault line. Consider driving to both entrances. The visitors center is at 29 Palms is located at the oasis which provided early native Americans a means of survival."
272,"Stunning Beauty, Highlight of Our Trip!","I always enjoy the desert at Joshua Tree National Park.  My boys, like me, find it delightful to find random large mounds of rocks and boulders that can be climbed without gear.  Just sitting 25, 50, or 100-foot in the air feels both serene and as if some great feat has been accomplished.  There are always small animals to see: lizards and jack rabbits; but most of the time there are also more interesting animals like snakes, tarantulas, foxes, and/or coyotes."
273,Make the loop! You won't regret it.,"Being NP aficionados, Joshua Tree has been on our list to visit for a few years.  We were not disappointed.  The scenery from the loop roads was diverse and wonderful.  We took a couple of relatively easy trail hikes.  My only quibble is on the Barker Dam and Hidden Valley Trails the descriptions/stories exceeded what we actually saw on the hikes."
274,"Cool, but not Nat. Park Cool",Rangers at the visitor center on Park (St./Ave.?) helped plan our half day trip. 6 adults and 8 kids (age 13 to 8) were able to get around easily. Lots of rocks to climb on the easier hikes. Unique and interesting park within easy driving distance of Palm Springs.
275,Serene and Beautiful,"There’s a lot to hike in this national treasure limited only by the amount of time you have!  We hiked the full Lost Horse Mine trail which takes you by an abandoned gold mine where rusted equipment still stands.  There is also a neat hand-built stone fireplace that is quite interesting.  It’s just four miles from the parking lot to the mine, round trip, but you can do the entire loop for six miles.  Just know that the parking lot only holds about 24 cars."
276,Enter by Yucca City if you can,"It isn’t for no reason this Park is a must see !!! It provides outstandingly gorgeous scenery and two alternative scenic roads, one full loop and one shorter route. Or you can chose both routes if you want. The main entrance is virtually always super crowded and waiting time can be significant. Because of this, we took the further entrance but, on reflection, this wasn’t the best decision as the most gorgeous areas are just after the main entrance. The further entrance’s landscape is rockier and has few and far Joshua Trees whilst on the other side there are vast Joshua Tree « forests » which are truly delightful. Make sure you’ve got plenty of time to enjoy the Park. There are several parking areas along the Park but you don’t always find a parking space available ... so getting there early is the key ! Strongly recommend to others!"
277,High Desert Beauty,"We decided to spend Christmas in Palm springs this year and get away from the snow home back in Canada. On the list of things to do had to be the Joshua Tree National Park, near Twentynine Palms. I'm a big U2 fan, so this was a must. We decided to make it a day trip to give us enough time to explore. We were staying in Palm Springs, so it was about a 50 minute drive up highway 62. It was a really sunny drive and about 17 degrees celsius, which was the average for December. There is a Joshua Tree Visitor Centre on the way into to the park, however it was closed due to the shutdown. Directly across the street from the visitor centre was a little shop. They sold park memorabilia like toques, shirts and post cards. What we found really cool though was that a local resident had set up a table out front of the store to provide info and maps for free to tourists. She just wanted to help out since the park had no workers on staff due to the shutdown.The drive into the park was a bit curvy, so you have to watch your speed. Once you get inside the park ,the plants , trees and landscape change immediately. It becomes similar to a desert. There are miles and miles of rock formations. Its like another planet. The rocks are all really smooth and weathered. It looks like you're driving through where water used to be. There are designated picnic areas along the way to take a break from driving. We stopped at Quail Springs. Its one of the bigger rest areas. There are bathrooms , a bbq hibachi, unusual rock formations and rock climbing if you have your gear with. Further into the park we noticed a lot of people were camping in tents among the rocks. We also stopped at Hidden Valley. This the biggest camping area. Please be aware there is no grass really. Tents are pegged into the dirt and situated between rocks to block the wind. Hidden Valley had a lot more campers and many more rock climbers. It was pretty chilly later in the day but that didn't stop them. Hidden Vally is a great place for pictures. Some of the rock formations look like people and are interesting.The total drive time through the park could be between 2 and 3 hours depending on how much you stop to take pictures. I think the best thing about our trip was to see these awesome rocks structures like from another planet. Because just right outside the park the vegetation and landscape go back to what Palm Springs looks like. Our least favourite part of the trip was just that no staff were in the park and most bathrooms were closed. We found that bringing comfortable joggers , a camera , jacket or warm sweater and food for lunch worked perfect for the trip.If you like good and cool things, you gotta check this out!"
278,Beautiful scenery and views,Joshua Tree was interesting but not on my list of favorite parks.  My son and daughter-in-law stayed longer and enjoyed it because there are becoming rock climbers.  They said it has some of the best climbing in the states.
279,Unlike any other park I've seen,"We did the Barker Dam trail and it was so pretty, it started snowing while we were hiking. After that we wanted to go to a couple more trails but we didn't take a map and the government was shut down so we just explored. If you go take a map to be safe"
280,Beautiful Park,"We spent two days at Joshua National Park, the first day was a bit of hiking and walking. Barker's Dam, trails along the way were easily defined. The rock formations are just incredible and extend for miles, the desert was blooming and flowers found were divine. The second day driving from one end to the other and stopping at sights along the way. Pictures do not do justice from what you will experience. Timing was perfect in April just the right temperature and not many crowds at all."
281,Good  outdoor  activity,"We had the best time on a girls trip and couldn't not make it to the national park. The drive through was easy and there were several stops along the way where you could get photos and see all of the neat things that Joshua Tree has to offer.If you're in the area and you have the chance, this is a must see!"
282,Amazing park with alien like landscape ,"We went to Joshua tree for three days and LOVED it. We were there over break (dec 29-31) so the park was crowded, but for the most part we didn't feel it. One thing that really helped that I would recommend is going to the ranger station before going into the park and asking them about where to go. The ranger we spoke to was friendly and suggested some hikes that were more off the beaten path (but still beautiful/fun) so that we weren't in places that were mobbed. There are lots of hikes of varying lengths/difficulty that aren't on the map of the park that they give you-so it's worth it to ask. If hiking isn't your thing, there are lots of short walks or sites you can basically just drive to as well. We did 2 intense hiking days and one laid back chill day in the park. Bring layers and food since you can't get it in the park (although there are cute restuarants in Joshua tree the town where we stayed- highly recommend).Yay have fun!"
283,Amazing park experience despite the government shut down,"Visit every time we are in the area, it's a must.  The word 'unique' is widely overused, but don't think there is anywhere else like it in the world.  Amazing."
284,"Of course, this place is amazing","What an amazing park.   First, you need to be able to apreciate the desert.   Next, the many ecosystems in the park.   But my favorite are the valleys near and around Hidden Valley Campground and Ryan.   Not only are there many very interesting rocks which will be climbed by many, but an awsome and serene set of valleys covered in a forest of Joshua Tree's."
285,Weekend in the Park,"I've been to Joshua Tree numerous times due to being a local in the desert area.  I particularly love going during the bloom, and this year we had the Super Bloom,  Although it was a little early in the high desert for the Super Boom the hike was amazing.  Good for any age and not too long.  Basically, a great starting point for the not so adventurous but still gorgeous enough to view what the desert and Joshua Tree has to offer."
286,With respect to Nature,Good for a great 2 days. There several hikes one can take. One involves climbing a hill. I have never seen anything like the rocks here.
287,The landscape is stunning and looks like moonscape. In fact a must see.,"What a beautiful piece of the earth. The park itself remains almost untouched, yet a roadway has been constructed, weaving through, to allow visitors the opportunity to explore and see the sights. We meandered along the road, regularly pulling off (on to the short stay park zones) for selfies and to simply marvel. The map provided on entry is clear and easy to follow. Whereas I was left in uncertain as to what Yosemite spend their NP entry charge on, not so with Joshua Tree - it’s clear a lot of time and money has been spent on balancing nature and tourism, and it showed. This was the best NP we visited on our road trip....we saw a rattlesnake! (but secretly I wanted to see a roadrunner!)"
288,Stunning!,It is located about 6 miles from Joshua Tree town. It has thousands Joshua trees in different shapes and heights and beautiful rock formations. Some rocks are huge and we saw many rock climbers there. There are few trails mostly easy and you can find in this park many spots for beautiful pictures. Do not miss the sunset which is so beautiful especially with a Joshua tree in the background.The most important is that this park is not packed with tourists like other park
289,See it with clouds in the shy,First visit. It’s about 1-hour from Downtown Palm Springs. Fees to enter. Senior Pass covers it. No food or beverages available for sale. Bring plenty of water; wear proper hiking shoes; use sunscreen; wear a hat; ensure your gas tank is full. Many stopping points throughout the Park. Highly recommended.
290,Glorious!,"We have been to this unique National Park many times and always find something different to see and do. This visit we took the short trail to the ruins of an Adobe house, only a mile and level with an abundance of wildlife to be seen. The Joshua trees themselves are fascinating and the best area to see the greatest specimens are in the northern parts of the park. Lots to see, get an early start."
291,A Must See,"We were given mixed reviews about going to see Joshua Tree National Park - but we're so glad we made the trip. Although very different from The Grand Canyon and Yosemite National Park - all three places are breathtaking in their own way. Joshua Tree can be seen anywhere from a one-hour quick drive-through or a day-long trip. We spent about four hours driving through the park and getting out often to capture a lot of pictures. The various landscapes are vast with a lot of rocks, mountains and Joshua trees. We loved it! If you bring a picnic lunch or dinner, you can stop at any of the vista points and enjoy a meal. If you plan on staying a while, be sure to bring water & food as there is no where to purchase these items in the park. Although the main road is paved, the paths and trails are not wheelchair accessible. But from the road, you can see everything very well for those that worry that this might deter them from going."
292,Wow!,"This is a beautiful park with lots of trails for all experience levels. Because of the government shutdown, the park was operating with a skeletal crew when we visited in mid-January. The visitor center was open and had functioning restrooms. The restrooms farther into the park (around Ryan Mountain trail) were locked. We didn't see trash cans overflowing or anything else we'd read about in the news. I think there were 8 rangers onsite. The Ryan Mountain trail is rated ""moderate,"" but I found it challenging (and worth it). One note: the peak you see from the parking lot is NOT the summit. The top is about another 45-minute trek from that peak. For an easier walk, I recommend Barker Dam. It's not strenuous at all, but there are some big rocks that are part of the trail, so unfortunately, it is not accessible to people who use wheelchairs. The rangers at the visitors' center are very helpful, and they can tell you what is accessible to all.Make sure you carry plenty of water. The air is dry, and dehydration is always a risk, even on cooler days. If you're diabetic or have any issues with your blood sugar, make sure you take some sweet drinks and carb snacks. You can walk thousands of steps without realizing it because of the surrounding beauty and vast landscape.Some of the signs at the trailheads are small, so it's helpful to get a map at the visitor's center or the gate before you drive in."
293,Rock formations,"Entering the park via the town of Joshua tree means you also go thru Yucca Valley. So you will see lots of Joshua trees along with Walmart ,Home Depot, etc. When you enter the park it feels very similar to town.  Entering the park via the Cottonwood entrance to the south you will have a much more dramatic wilderness experience.The road rises from the Colorado desert to the Mojave desert. There are far more mountain goats in this part of the park  and far fewer people. No there is no climbing or Joshua trees yet.However if you over night at the 29 Palms Inn (town of Twentynine Palms)and the next morning go back thru the park west exiting at the town of Joshua tree you’ll get all the Joshua trees and climbing you can imagine plus it will feel much more isolated. This route works without an overnight stay very easily but is at least 2 hours longer than entering at the town of Joshua Tree."
294,Stunning,"One could spend days in this park but since we had only one we opted to drive uo to the west entrance and make our way down to the south entrance. The actual drive is about two hours but you will want to stop often to walk the side trails along the way. Be sure to walk the trail into Hidden Valley. When you enter the park from the west entrance stop at the visitor center. It has some good information. The lanscape in that area is Joshua trees and incredible rock formations. As you move south the secenery changes to flatter; more desert terain. If you go in early spring after lots of rain as we did the desert is in bloom. An incredible sight. Go see it for yoursef, you will come back amazed."
295,Great National Park,"This was our third year to visit this park and while our main goal was the tour of Keys Ranch, there had been an unusual amount of rain this year and the wild flowers and Joshua Trees were in bloom and more spectacular than for our previous visits. So the first day, we drove in a short distance from the North Entrance just to see the flowers. Even in years without so much rain, the park has a rugged beauty. The park can be divided into two deserts, the cooler and wetter high desert with the Joshua Trees and few cactus and the hot dry low desert with more cactus and almost no Joshua Trees. In addition to the plants, there are many interesting rock formations. Don’t miss Keys View. There are many camp sites but we always stay in town. There are pieces of past human settlement such as Keys Ranch and Barker Dam."
296,Surreal landscape,"Joshua tree National park is so much larger than we had ever imagined. At first you just see Joshua Trees, then large rock hills begin to enter the landscape. We were disappointed that the “Ranch”  was only available to people with reservations. In our search of things to see and do, we had not come across any mention of reservations being required. Also, the parking lot to the Dam was so full, we had to drive back to the next closest parking lot about 1.5 to 2 miles away!.On another note, and related to the above title, make sure you fill up your gas tank before entering the park, as every sight, hike, or garden is far away from all the other attractions within the park.  Our lack of gas ( 1/4 tank) prevented us from seeing several of the attractions that we had hoped to see.  Next time, we will fill up before entering the park!"
297,Wonderful experience despite shutdown,Visiting Joshua Tree national park was the best part of our trip to this area. We had no idea how HUGE the park is. It's a full day whether you decide to hike or drive. It's $30 per car to get in. Natural wonders and endless beauty are found in here.
298,Take walking shoes no matter what.,"Joshua Tree is a wonderful place. There's great hiking, and from one spot there's a great view of the San Andreas fault. But my favorite thing in the park is the gigantic, other-wordly rocks that decorate its grounds. I once convinced a friend they were left there by a film company doing an outer space movie!"
299,Not blown away,A must do.   Nothing else in 29 Palms except this.   We did a three hour hike.  I recommend starting at Split Rock and going to Eagles Crest mine.  I think it’s called that.  Its a difficult hike and do not do in extreme heat.  But ask the office how to get there.   A well preserved mine area.   So worth it.
300,This park is breathtaking and incredible.,"Having traveled twice from Las Vegas to visit Joshua Tree National Park, I can only encourage those who've never been to take time for one of the true gems of our Park system.The routes through North-South or East-West offer very different landscapes and natural attractions. I suggest that you can't go wrong either way but even better if you take time for both should you plan it. Rock formations, wildlife, incredible cacti and plant life all in a well-maintained environment. We will definitely visit again."
301,Ominous and clearly beautiful,"I saw better Joshua Trees in other places, it is worth to see but a bit expensive entrance and they accepting cards or exact change. Bring water and snack with you. Quite long drive and lots of stops to take a picture."
302,One of the Nation’s Best! ,"There a lot of fun things to do in this park and I'm glad we came here even thought we were on a rush. I recommend visiting hidden valley and the skull rock. We went there during the winter and it was very chilly so make sure you bring some coats. There was a lot of people so it was hard to find parking. It was still a fun visit and since we went there during the government shutdown, we got in for free."
303,Walking onto another Planet,Our family visited Joshua Tree National Park st the end of June. It was in the evening before sunset and it was absolutely beautiful.   Glad we went.  I highly recommend it.
304,Park is open,"The park is well signposted and a long drive from Los Angeles. We stopped at the visitor centre to get directions. The views on the park are outstanding and it is just amazing to see the plants, there are many cacti other than the eponymous Joshua tree. The park was pretty busy, with lots of brave souls climbing the boulders.Well worth a visit"
305,Cholla Cactus Garden.  Not to be missed,"The park offers an amazing array of recreational areas.  There are hiking trails, rock climbing, history, sights to see, things to learn and amazing photographs to take.I have heard that visiting at night is also amazing but we didn't have time for that."
306,Peaceful and Breath Taking,We got up early and had a drive trough Joshua Tree NP to our next stop. We spend around 5 hours hete. We got out at some places like Skull Rock and walked the trails. Very nice and fun to do! I would really recommend spending some time here!
307,Beautiful place to visit,"First time visiting Joshua Tree National Park.  Took me an hr and a half to get here. I started off at 8 am and arrived at 9:30 am. Unfortunately, my pass expired, so rather than spend $30 on one time visit, I decided to renew my annual pass, so u know what that meant, more fun adventure.  I started off hiking on multiple trails, however Hidden #saturdayfunday☀️😎😍 #joshuatreenationalpark #hiddenvalleyjoshuatree #rocks #trees🌳 #humidweather #gustywind #nationalparkpass #firsttimeatjoshuatree #2020goalsetting #livedloved❤ #happyadventure #adventureneverend #hikerforlife🌳 #peace✌️"
308,Very enjoyable,"We visited Joshua Tree last year and loved it so much we decided to go again and take our son and Jo’s Mum who hadn’t been. We left early again as we found this best last time as you pretty much have the park to yourself. The early morning colours and the rock formations are just stunning and will leave you amazed at what Mother Nature can, rocks at times are balanced on top of one another and the Joshua trees can be hundreds of years old. Standing in parts of them It’s so quiet, there isn’t a sound to be heard. We left the park at around 9am and there was a solid stream of cars coming is so it’s worth the effort to get there early."
309,Fantastic places but be careful ,"Continuing our visits to many NP’s in the west celebrating our 40th Anniversary, we spent several hours in Joshua Tree today. Very enjoyable, not too many other visitors, so traveling through the park and hiking to points of interest was stress free. The history and beauty of the park were surprising. The high and low deserts are so different, yet beautiful in ways we did not expect.    You definitely want this park on your bucket list when traveling the southwest."
310,Maze loop trail,"We visited this park five years ago during our honeymoon and pretty much had the place to ourselves. My what a difference a half a decade makes! When we arrived at the West entrance we found a long line of vehicles waiting to enter. This was very unexpected as it was not a holiday or weekend but early on a Friday. Nevertheless the park, landscape, rock formations and of course the Joshua Trees are so very unique it was worth the wait, even for a second trip."
311,Like Landing on Another Planet!,"We included Joshua Tree as part of our US road trip, and it was a great stop. There are so many trails that I wish we had a lot longer here!There are so many viewpoints which make the place completely beautiful, and there are so many natural wonders.Tip: If you do wish to camp make sure you book in advance as a lot of the camp sites get fully booked!"
312,perfect for solitude amongst weirdly formed beautiful rocks and trees,"The landscape is breathtaking. We went on one of the hottest days of the year, so that impeded a lot of hiking. It has so many different landscapes throughout the park, so see them all. Also go at different times of the day as well. We went back into the park for sunset and to look at the stars. It was amazing. The only disappointing thing for us was not seeing many animals. Definitely bring lots of water, snacks, food in with you. Only flushable toilets are at park entrances, but the bathrooms that are within the park are clean. Wonderful experience."
313,Day trips from Palm Springs,I was on a road trip from LA to Las Vegas and stopping at several places en-route and had always wanted to drive through Joshua Tree National Park so this was an ideal opportunity to do it. I am SO glad I did as the scenery is absolutely stunning. When I turned off the freeway the first thing I noticed were all the flowers. You don't think that a desert will be so pretty! I stopped at the Cottonwood Visitor Centre to pay the fee to pass through the Park and then set off on the 56 mile drive through the park to Twentynine Palms where I was staying overnight. The massive boulders and rock formations are incredible and make all sorts of shapes and of course the Joshua trees are everywhere and the further into the Park you get the larger the trees get. I really enjoyed the drive and the road is nice and quiet so you can stop to take photos when something catches your eye (every 2 mins). I didn't do any hiking but every camp site in the park was full so it shows what a popular destination it is. A definite highlight of my trip.
314,Almost surreal,"Between trips here I always forget just how much beauty there is in the park. You can make an hour out of an easy one mile hike, lots of stopping and staring."
315,"Cold in late December, but GORGEOUS","I can not even put into words how amazing this park is! The welcome center workers were very knowledgeable on what we should do, should take, ect. The skies were great at the time and everything about this park was breathtaking.  I highly recommend this to any and everyone! Our family loved it! So much to see!"
316,Great National Park with amazing camping sites,We returned to Joshua Tree National Park in Middle of August 2018.  It was a warm but not hot day.  The views of the desert and Joshua Trees are always amazing.  We used our national park pass to go to the park
317,Dress warmly!,It was scenic but not exactly user friendly for us.  My husband is mobility impaired and there wasn't much more than a drive around the circuit for us.  And there were not many pull outs for taking photos.The rocks-and-joshua-trees made for some scenic photos.
318,Climbing Trip,"We visited the Joshua Tree National Park (JTNP) in July, on two days both in excess of 110 degrees.  As such, we were cautioned not to hike, even if experienced, which we are not.  As it turns out, a good bit of the park is viewable from the car, and short, 20-30 minute walks allow you to see many other sites.  I am a nut for geology and plants, so I found this park fascinating.  Especially since living in Florida we have very little desert or rocks.  There is not much else, so if you are looking for anything else, especially wildlife, we found very little.  The views are spectacular but be prepared it takes several hours to drive between the points of interest.  I strongly recommend visiting the ranger stations on the way in for pointers and a logical travel path. In July there were very few visitors, due to the heat, but have been told that in cooler months the place is packed.  Be prepared and take all you will need, water, food, snacks and comfortable shoes, as the park is isolated and you cannot easily jump out to local towns."
319,Pure Magic!!!,Worth every bit of the trek. The scenery is unbelievable!!!!  Definitely fuel up on Gas and water before going. The climate is super hot and dry
320,Great experience despite shutdown,"I can't ever get enough of Joshua Tree National Park. I go here every time I travel from NYC to LAX (not THAT often, lol) but I've visited several times and I love every visit. I admit I have yet to see any wild animal they claim to have in the visitors centre! However, take a look at the giant rock formations, the endless cacti and Joshua trees. Drive up to that beautiful area where you can visualise the San Andreas fault line along Mount San Jacinto and Palm Springs. Its such an amazing view!"
321,Beautiful but needs better signage and visitor information,"Though this place was scenic, I was not prepared for the long drive through it on an empty stomach. There was no food (besides Cliff Bars) available at the Cottonwood Visitor Center where I entered, and I never saw a gas station during my journey through the park which is larger than the state of Rhode Island. Luckily, I had trail mix and a pretty full tank of gas, but I feared I may not make it from one end to the other in my rental car.I specifically went to hike, but was not impressed with what the park had to offer. It was a disappointing after paying $30. The hikes are spread out and hard to find. They did not seem well maintained or well marked. One trail I went on (The Mastodon Loop) did not appear to be a loop at all. Rather, it seemed to stop at the peak. Thus, I went back from whence I came. Just before you get to the peak there was a sign that read “not maintained” so I never made it all the way up. I never found a sign for the trail at Hidden Valley. I noticed another reviewer stated the trail sign was “hidden” in Hidden Valley. That was my experience too. If I travel to Joshua Tree National Park in the future (not likely), I will be sure to pack a picnic lunch and fill up my gas tank just prior to entering. It seems like a rock climber’s paradise, but for a moderate hiker like me, I think I’ll stick to the Indian and Tahquiz Canyons which are better maintained, marked and cheaper or the Whitewater Preserve which offers amazing hiking and its FREE!!"
322,Wonderful Rock Formations!,"Spent several hours hiking and expiring the trails.  While it was hot, there was nothing that we chose that was to strenuous that could not be done by both adults and children. Remember to take plenty of water and sunscreen. There are some unique formations and the scenery is at times breathtaking in its vastness. We explored a lot around the area in general and are happy that we took a day to visit the Joshua Tree park."
323,Awe inspiring,This place was absolutely awesome. If you enjoy hiking two days is enough. Take your time and get some great pictures. This place has amazing geologic features.
324,Much cooler than I expected,Went in early Feb. and the wind was howling and it was about 32 degrees-tough to get out of the car for pics. But the day was beautiful and the scenery amazing. Our teen wasn't as into it as she expected but hubby & I would go back. So glad the government opened so we could use the gift shop and get tickets there and talk to the rangers.
325,Awesome,"I cannot express the beauty of this place in words. This was my first time there and I fell in love. There are gorgeous hikes, views and bouldering opportunities. We also went rock climbing and the view from 80 feet off the ground is breath taking. I can't wait to go back."
326,This National Park is amazing!,"I visited Joshua Tree National Park, in May 2018, and was pleasantly surprised by diligence and hospitality of the personnel of the visitors center,  and amazed by the unusual beauty of the place.  The whole park is like poem in stone. A place like no other. We hiked couple of trails. The temperature was just right, views beautiful and the sky crystal clear and blue.  Trails were well marked,  lot of info available on local animals and plants,  and plenty of rest stops and restrooms. Entry pass is $25 per car,  and it is valid for a week. I loved this place,  and would gladly go back again."
327,Very Big,"This park is the meeting of two very different desert environments.  To the northwest, the higher wetter desert has the Joshua Trees, to the southeast, it is classically Sonoran desert with ocotillo and cholla.  Rock formations are different in each desert as well.  Get there early, as it does stack up.  Bring water, and if you are cycling, be aware the roads are VERY rough."
328,Not the south entrance! ,"First, this place is open and it is free during the government shutdown. Although I heard about a lot of damage and bad behavior in the park during the shutdown, I had no such observations of the mayhem. It was in the fifties (50's) out. The park is about an hour from Palm Springs. I loved looking at the Joshua trees of all different shapes and sizes, in addition to the colorful rocks and mountains. The yuccas are also quite a big thing to see. I went after a big rainstorm, and unfortunately, I could not view the panorama from Keys Point due to the dense fog. You must see Skull Rock, Ryan Mountain, the House of Horrors, and many of the other well-noted attractions. During the rain, surfaces may be slippery, so be careful!"
329,A unique park to visit,"Drove up from Palm Springs on a day trip. Well worth the drive, great and helpful staff at the reception office / shop as you go into the park, marked trails and plenty of places to get away from everybody else."
330,A Christmas to rememeber,"If you don’t have the extended time or interest to camp or visit over multiple days, this park is still very seeable in a single day visit. The Joshua Trees are best seen on the road up to Keys View and the main valley section. The cholla cactus area is well worth a visit too"
331,Iconic Desert Garden of the Stars!,"I have been there in the winter and summer, but first time in the spring. The flowers were amazing, especially in cottonwood. The scenery and the flora changes mile to mile. Count on two days to travel from one end to the other if you want to enjoy it."
332,Come prepared,This is one of the most interesting and beautiful place we have visited during our trip through the southwest of the USA. The screnery is amazing. You should try to visit the parc early in the morning as it got really hot over the day.
333,Hiking Heaven for the wintertime in JoshuaTree,"So much to see. It was interesting, informative and fun. Worth the trip. I would love to see the night sky."
334,Amazing place,"Dear friends,We drove approximately 2 hours from L.A. to the park and first there was like nothing impressive and my husband wanted to turn around and not interested at all to continue,But I convinced him to pay the entrance fee of $30 and so we went in.Again first nothing, but then our eyes popped wildly open.There are huge rocks all over the place and we kept stopping to take pictures and were climbing around.Beautiful blooming cactus and the Joshua tree everywhere.There were area’s for grilling allocated with numbers as well as bin’s and WC.Some people had tents placed too.The park is a must visit.It is worth more than $30!Enjoy and have food and drinks with you.The park is huge.Enjoyyyyy"
335,Miles of Desert,"We spent a full day at Joshua with our family of five and I recommend it. We went in through the southern entrance stopping at Cottonwood Visitors Centre for maps and suggestions and to pay our park fees $30 for car. We then drove though the park stopping at major areas for short walks and even 2pm ranger tour on Joshua Tree itself which highly recommend at Capp Rock (visitors centre will advise when and where to find rangers tour). The rangers tours are always a highlight and we learnt so much about this amazing tree and park that elevated our trip. We came out at western Joshua Trees exit. I recommend this route as the Joshua Trees will reveal themselves to you as you progress through the park. the western end Joshua Trees are in the surrounding suburb and so will spoil the show without any context of seeing them in their desert environ or understanding their incredible story.Take lots of food and water - no cafes through the park. Take a full tank of petrol too. Lots of driving from one end to the other and you don’t want to risk running out. Check out the weather on a weather app specifically for the park as it is surprisingly quite different to Palm Springs and dress appropriately. For winter, it was significantly cooler and we luckily took extra layers. Sunscreen, sunhat etc. There are toilets in most of the camping spots throughout the park. Finally, get there early in the day. Most areas can only be explored during daylight hours, no exceptions.,"
336,Good place to see stars,"We entered the National Park at its northwestern gate, and drove to various locations by car. You can typically park right at these. Before leaving at the northeastern gate, we took some extra miles' drive to the Cholla Cactus Garden, which was really worthwile. It was really hot here, though...  ;-)   Great location for desert, Joshua Trees and unique rock locations."
337,Unexpectedly Breathtaking,"I am embarrassed to admit this, but we have been living in Southern California for 40 years before visiting this remarkable park.  This park is entirely different than other desert parks we have visited, such as Death Valley and White Sands.  The park features a variety of fauna as you transit from south to north, as we did.  We entered off the I-10, first seeing an oasis, then a Cholla Garden and then at the north end the Joshua Trees.  This route takes you from the low desert of the Coachella Valley to the high desert.  The midsection of the drive offers you magnificent panoramic views.  We will return."
338,One Of The Most Stunning Parks In The World,"The main Joshua Tree Visitor Centre is less than 200 meters (660 feet) from the 29 Palm Highway.We arrived around 10 on a sunny mid April weekday and the information and interpretive center was very busy.  A short drive from the information center, is the toll booth and we were told there was a 15 to 30 minute wait to get into the park.The main objective for our day was the 49 Palms Oasis hike (see my review) and then a park drive-through.  In hindsight, this was a good idea as we avoided the crowd at the main entrance.After our 49 Palms Oasis trail hike we visited the Oasis Visitor Center.  This Center is about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from the 49 Palms hike. At this center there is a self guided Interpretive walk on a paved trail.  The loop is 900 meters (1/2 mile) and shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.Inside the Oasis information center, there is information on the flora and fauna.  There is also history of this desert region including training World War II soldiers for desert warfare.  There is in fact an army base in the region. After visiting the information center, we drove through the park and stopped at various sites including skull rock – a rock formation that looks like a skull.The national park is quite big so you can spend all day there if you visit all the information centers (all 4) and also take in some short hikes.I would rate the overall federal park attraction as 4 out of 5 – very good.Notes &Tips:    • buy an annual federal park that will get you into all the national parks in the US.  The pass is good for 1 vehicle; not per person.    • parking lot    • coffee shop    • washroom facilities    • retail gift shops    • If you’re planning to do some hiking you should have snacks for your trip.  We purchased food at the Von’s supermarket on the 29 Palms highway and made sandwiches.  The store is about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the main national park information center.    • Take a pamphlet and map from the main information center.    • To be more efficient, do your research before you get to the park    • Our Air Bnb was located on the edge of the main Joshua Tree National Park information centre."
339,Hit the Open Road,"We have been here many a time and always find something new to see and do, there are 3 entrances all with a visitor centre and all the rangers are really helpful and full of ideas and advice, it should always be your first port of call when visiting. The best area to see the fabulous Joshua Trees themselves is from the NW entrance and I think it also has the best trails and rocks, easy to drive through in a day if that's all you have."
340,You like the outdoors-Come here!,The picture was taken at 9:30pm. The Milky Way was just on top of the Arch Rock. I got a lot of nice evening pictures too. Joshua tree was beautiful.
341,Beautiful desert landscapes,"It's like nothing I've experienced before.well worth the trip.If coming from Palm Springs, slow down through Morongo Valley!!! Speed trap!"
342,Diverse landscape views,This is a beautiful park.  We took 6 hikes in three days.  The weather at the beginning of February was very cold and windy. Take a lot of water as the trails are very dry.
343,"Rock Formations, Some Joshua Trees","We have been to Joshua Tree several times.    We stop at the nearby Ranger station to get park information, maps, and use the bathroom.  We then drive further to enter at the East entrance.    It gets the rather boring highway driving done first so that when we are finished with our visit (we don’t go out the south entrance) we go out the west entrance and have less driving on our way back to I10.   More people also come in the west entrance so by going in the East side, we are going against the general flow of traffic,"
344,Great Way to Hike the Desert,"I had been to Joshua Tree National Park before but had never really explored it very far. While visiting friends there we experienced some cool weather but the sights are simply beautiful. The mass of boulders you come to amazing to poke around and explore. To see the variety of desert life that thrives there was quite surprising once you get up close and off the pavement. If you have the time, it is worth the effort to visit. Don't forget your camera!"
345,Fascinating corner of the desert,This is a beautiful park that you can drive miles and miles through. A small $30/car fee gets you access to a clean Park with lots of restrooms and cookout stations with ample picnic tables and overnight camping.  The rocks wee claimable but I would suggest a helmet for falling.
346,Must hike,"We've visited Joshua Tree before many years ago, with our kids who got bored easily.  This time we were on our own, so we could do some hiking and check out the various types of plants there.  We enjoyed the outcroppings of round rocks, like at Jumbo Rocks Campground, and Skull Rock, as well as the areas with lots of cholla cactus and ocotillos.  Saw a few jackrabbits too while walking trails!  If you can't get to the park though, there are lots of Joshua Trees in the Victorville/Helendale/Barstow area.  Those ""trees"" are so unusual and supposedly only located in the deserts of southern California, so that makes them special."
347,Amazing rock formations,Recommend this park for a visit to see some stunning scenery. It’s great for everyone as you can drive to the best bits and have a wander around rock formations and have amazing views close to where you park up. Perfect when it is 40 degrees plus! Would love to come again in cooler conditions to hike a trail or two.
348,Stunning landscapes,"The best viewing is from the Eastern Entrance, you really do not have to enter the park to see this years display.  But after driving the entire length we ended here about 3:30 PM.  The sun just beginning to set, a yellow glow in the misty distance just above the mountains.  The amounts of rainfall make this a truly spectacular year. The weekends must be crazy, because this was a Monday and some lunch areas had been full for our picnic.  We parked and went exploring on foot, vigilant not to step on any area but sand or rock as to not crush any flowers who usually struggle to bloom.  This year there so many, that it is really difficult to wind your way through.  Time considerations forced us to leave before we wanted, places to go, dinner to eat.  I personally had never been to this National Park before.  Missing all the rock formations, the Joshua trees themselves in all the different shapes and sizes, walking up to the views at over a mile high. This was an amazing afternoon, one I will remember."
349,Go here!,"I was lucky enough to be able to visit this historic place with my husband and two friends on our holiday break.  We drove from Palm Springs, which took about an hour.  When we arrived, they were supposed to charge us an entrance fee, but they were only stopping the members to show their badge.  The person told navigating traffic told us to pay on the way out.  So, we entered and immediately stopped at the restrooms and checked out the routes and maps.  We drove slowly through like everyone else.  It was especially great to see when we did because there was snow all over the place.  It was so peaceful, tranquil and beautiful. There is nothing like it in the world.  We spent a good hour driving through, stopping to look and take pictures and then exiting. We had expected to pay when we were exiting, but they were not monitoring the exit since so many cars were coming in the entrance.  We felt guilty for not paying, but had to keep moving. This is such a special place and everyone, no matter what age, should check it out."
350,What a Fantastic Park!,"We drove through the park on our way from Palm Springs to Las Vegas.  It was a really great drive.  A lot of interesting vistas and an amazing experience.  At one point I felt as though I was on another planet.  Amazing.  Way better that taking the six lanes road to Vegas.  They it out, you won't be disappointed."
351,Spectacular and unique,Spent the day with the family. I would say make sure you have a map or a picture of a map because there is no coverage in the park. We had taken a screen shot of a map before we came out for the day. The early morning (we were in the park by 8am) was a great idea. Even in November it was HOT by 11am.
352,"Excellent hikes, great views",It was super busy due to the holiday and the recent snow.  Some roads and trails were closed.  The ranger recommended that we enter through the North Entrance which we did.  Due to traffic we only stopped at one place with sufficient parking.   At least we did see some of the rock formations along the drive.   Some slow downs due to folks parking where they should not.   If you are serious about hiking pick a slower time to visit. Overall beauty even on a drive through is stunning.
353,Rather seen the ones in AZ,"This is a unique landscape; recommended hikes include: hidden Valkey, skull, Barker loop, northern loop and Keyes view.  Soft hiking on the feet.  Wonderful vistas. The Joshua tree is so whimsical and unique."
354,Astounding natural rock formations,"We visited the park for two days.  On the first day we explored it by driving from the Joshua Tree Visitor Center to the Cottonwood Visitor Center.  We stopped at Hidden Valley, Skull Rock, and the cholla cactus garden was pretty.  I would definitely recommend wearing closed toe shoes and pants if you walk through the cactus garden. On the second day we toured the Keys Ranch which was a highlight!  (I highly recommend the tour, but make a reservation because it's seasonal...) The Barker Dam hike was a great hike because it was connected to the Keys Ranch story.  We could not find the Wall Street Mill but did stumble upon some artifacts (an crumbled building, an old car and a windmill) along the way.  The Worth Bagley Stone is no longer in place but there is a marker.  There are multiple visitor centers -Black Rock Nature Center, Oasis Visitor Center, Joshua Tree Visitor Center and Cottonwood.  I was thrilled to find restrooms with running water at the Cottonwood and Oasis locations.  The Oasis location also has a short, paved trail to walk and a gift shop.  Parking is limited at the trailhead of each hike so I would recommend going early as the park is always open.  There are 8 camping locations throughout the park.  Bell, Hidden Valley, Ryan and White Tank are ""first-come, first-served sites.""  Black Rock, Cottonwood, Indian Cove, and Jumbo Rocks are reserve ahead sites. Note that there are campgrounds north of the park- HipCamp, Joshua Tree Lake RV and Campground, JT Sportsman's Club and Twentynine Palms RV Resort.  Chiriaco Summit is a campground that is located south of the park.  During high season you have the option of using the free RoadRunner shuttle bus.  Buses depart from Twentynine Palms transit center and the Oasis Visitor Center every hour and buses run every 30 minutes inside the park.  If you have children be sure to ask for an activity booklet so your kids can earn a badge!"
355,*You Have To See It To Believe It*,Some very interesting scenery not seen many other places.  Worth a visit though be aware that it is hot.
356,A mesmerizing road trip,"While staying in Palm Desert, we decided to visit Joshua Tree National Park.  Just one hour from our resort, we entered from the Visitor Center in Joshua Tree, at the western side of the park.  As soon as you enter the park, you will be surrounded by hundreds of Joshua Trees.  Stop at Hidden Valley for an easy 1 mile/30 minute walk in a boulder protected valley once used reportedly by cattle rustlers.  Continue your drive on to Keys View, elevation over 5000 feet with views to the Mexican border.  Finish the 1 1/2 hour loop of the park at the Oasis Visitor Center, or continue south to Cholla Cactus Garden.Bring a jacket if you go in January, water, maybe a picnic.  Plenty of restrooms along the way.Though you could pay for an off-road Jeep tour,  it isn't necessary to have a wonderful drive-yourself experience in this park."
357,Beautiful Wilderness,"During a recent trip to Palm Springs, my wife and I decided to take in Joshua Tree National Park. It was so beautiful and peaceful, we made two trips through the park!14,000 acres larger than the state of Rhode Island, this park is famous for its population of ""yucca brevifolia"", otherwise known as Joshua Trees.  The park is located at the intersection of two deserts, the Colorado and the Mojave.  The interesting thing is that due to changes in climate, the southern portion of the park (in the Colorado desert) is devoid of its namesake inhabitant.  And that is exactly where my wife and I entered the park (off the I-10).  During our first trip though this beautiful mountainous landscape we traveled south to north, spending time taking pics at Palomino Mountain. On the road, we learned that the Colorado desert's signature inhabitant is the Ironwood Tree, watched a woman pull cholla spines from her calf (ouch) at the Cholla Cactus Garden, and encountered many of the deserts four-legged inhabitants, including the Mojave fringe-toed lizard.In the northern section of our drive (in the Mojave desert) we finally got to see some fantastic specimens of Joshua Trees.  By the time we reached a fork in the road just north of the Belle campground, we had spent over four hours in this amazing park and had seen enough.  We took the fork to the right and headed out the north entrance toward our final destination in Palm Springs.  Little did we know what we were missing!Before heading home, we decided to revisit the park.  The cool thing is that, like most National Parks, if you pay for admission, that admission is good for seven days!  On our way home, we decided to drive our route backward, from the north entrance through the south and on to the I-10.  But small error led to a big surprise!When we came to our fork in the road, we missed our turn!  That was when the real beauty of the northern end of this park became evident!  We instead drove through the Joshua tree-covered areas of Jumbo Rocks and Sheep's Pass, passing an area known as ""The Chamber of Horrors"" before I realized that we were going the wrong way!  As incredible as the scenery was, we doubled back before we had reached the park's west entrance, made our turn, and headed south toward home. This park is amazing!  Take your time and see it all.  the northern end, in the Mojave desert, is filled with Joshua Trees and other awesome sights.  But be sure to visit the southern end of the park as well.  It has a beauty all its own. As for my wife and me, we will tour this park again.  Two trip through was just not enough."
358,2 Worlds Combine,"If you're on a day trip from Palm Springs, and want to do a drive through the entire park with a bit of hiking; enter at the west entrance and hike the following:Barker Dam (1.5 mile loop; easy)Hidden Valley (1 mile roundtrip; easy)Keys View – short, paved loop path. Nice views of the San Andreas Fault, Mount San Jacinto, Mount San Gorgonio, and the Salton Sea.Skull Rock – great for photography stop off the right side of the road (quick stop or easy 2 mile hike)Cholla Cactus Garden (0.25 miles roundtrip flat trail; easy) - this was my favourite spot!Cottonwood Spring – Visitor CenterBe sure to bring lots of water and snacks as there are no eateries once in the park."
359,So Much More Than Joshua Trees,"This was our second visit to the park.We did some of the hiking trails that we were not able to get to last time.Beautiful scenery, the Joshua trees, and the cactus garden. WOW! I have never seen such a wonder as the Cholla cactus garden.I wish I could stay a while longer, it will be even more beautiful when everything is in bloom."
360,Overwhelmed with the beauty!,Came here for the day and had a blast. It was crazy hot so didn't hike the Ryan mountain we had planned to but still saw some great sights and had a great time!
361,Sunset from the top of the Joshua Tree National Forest (Keys View),"This is an easy half day or full day drive-through sort of park.  Few off-season crowds and some great scenes—flowers in the south, interesting rock formations, cacti, and of course Joshua trees.  Easy hikes and climbs.  Varied terrain.  Few amenities."
362,A visit and hiking,"The park is amazing. I would suggest buying tickets at the visitor center first as there was a pretty long line waiting to enter the park and didn’t prepay. We were able to skip a good part of the waiting line because we prepaid. Also, bring water and snacks because there is nothing available in the park, which makes sense for obvious reasons. Also grab a map at the visitors center. Cell service is very limited in the park. The map also pins some of the more well known parts. Joshua Tree N.P. was truly magnificent!"
363,Magical mystical place!,"We drove up from Palm Springs and are very glad we did so.  The ""Skull"" (part of the ""Jumbo Rocks"") is worth the trip by itself.  We took about a one-hour hike from the Skull and watched kids enjoying climbing up the assorted rock and all the other fun everyone was having.  We stayed for the ""Sky's the Limit"" event just outside the park and were quite disappointed.  After waiting about 2 hours to get into the dome to look through the large telescope, there wasn't much to it.  We don't recommend that part."
364,Wonderful views,"Give yourself a few hours to enjoy this Stark but beautiful landscape. This is high desert so keep yourself well hydrated. The hikes along the trails are casual and beautiful and the trees were in bloom when we were there in March. There are huge rock formations which are great for climbing but be careful it is pretty windy here. We really enjoyed our visit. The bad part was the graffiti everywhere on the way out. When the government shutdown was in affect some thoughtless selfish, criminals defaced many of the beautiful rock formations. Aside from that, this is a very beautiful park if you enjoy desert landscapes."
365,One of our favorites!,"We have visited Joshua Tree a couple times on past visits.   This time, we went to the Cholla Cactus Garden.  It's absolutely spectacular in the late afternoon as the sun begins to soften. Great photo opps.  Worth the extra distance."
366,Great place to visit!,"July 4th, very hot...  Cut our visit to 1/2 day.   Bring lots of water.  There are plenty of rock formations, so plenty of hikes and trails... Excellent.   Almost every formation is unique.  Get out of your car and climb and explore."
367,Vast High Desert,"This was our second visit to this park. Last year we visited in February when the trees were not yet in bloom. This year the trees were blooming and the desert was in flower. We drove through the park on the main road with no detours this year, though I can recommend that you detour to see the overlook. The views of the valley are terrific. The wind was intense this year so we passed on doing that this year. If you drive all the way to Twentynine Palms, you'll see a change in terrain and vegetation that is lovely. The desert was awash with yellow, orange, and purple blooms. Once we had lunch in Twentynine Palms, we returned the way we came so we could see the park from a different angle and take more photos. Since our 96yo mother was with us, we did not stop to hike but viewed what we could from the car. If you need to do the same, you should know that the famous Skull Rock can be seen from the road. Park and walk up to it. It is an easy and worthwhile walk to get a closer view. The geology and the flora, fauna, and wildlife of the park is so interesting that it is worth your time to stop at the visitor center and gather information to make your visit more enjoyable and educational. This park is a must see while in Southern California."
368,"Large beautiful park, many trails",Joshua Treet is an amazing park. You can do various easy and short hikes here. Be sure to bring a lot of water because it can be very hot here.
369,Glad I did once,Make sure you have a full gas tank and PLENTY of water before you enter the park. The rangers at the visitor center are a great resource. We really enjoyed our visit there. So many rock formations and all those quirky amazing Joshua Trees.
370,"A busy place, if you want a more raw desert experience, look elsewhere. ","What a great way to spend your day! Make sure you take lots of drinking water! We packed a lunch and had a picnic in hidden valley! Keys view is definitely worth the drive to the view point! Make sure you check out skull rock! If 1 day isn’t enough, your pass is good for 7 days!"
371,Wonderful experience!,"Due to the Trump administration's government shutdown, we were unable to access the majority of the park.  Even so, this park is eye candy.  At the overlap of both the Mojave and Colorado deserts, and with elevation changes thrown into the mix, it offers an otherworldly panorama.  Despite the rumors to the otherwise, the park was free of trash during our January visit.  We encountered numerous volunteers who were picking up trash and doing general maintenance services.  Their efforts were heart warming.  Even the restroom areas were relatively clean.  Thank you to all those who make such efforts!This was our second visit to the park.  We were  lucky enough on our initial visit to come after a 7 year drought ended.  Seeing the desert in bloom was breathtaking, and if you can plan a visit in April and May seeing such a sight is a bucket list item.  Even though it was cold in January, it was sunny, dry, and more comfortable than an east coast January.  The park has a big sky and even in January seeing wide expanses of blue were very welcome.We highly recommend two stops.  An easy hike through the cholla cactus garden is just plain cool.  Be aware that old cactus stems fall off with spikes intact and will cause much pain if they attach to your body.  The cactus are referred to as jumping cactus for their penchant of somehow knowing when to latch out at you and lance you.  The second stop is a hike at the Cottonwood oasis.  Seeing the only native California palm in all its ancient glory is impressive.  The history of the oasis area is fascinating as well.  Thoroughly enjoyable hiking experience and not very difficult.All in all this is a fantastic park not only from its unique biological perspective but also from its weird and wonderful geologic past.  You can easily do the park via driving through with random stops if you are pressed for time.  The best way however is to at least throw in a few strategic hikes to take in the amazing environment this park offers.  You will carry the memories for a life time."
372,Beautiful park seen from both ends,So you're going up to the park to just look around no intention of walking out and in the trails but.  Even a little short walk really needs to have some walking shoes in you will be real happy that you took them and it is worth even the little trails that they've got.  Saw the sign for sheep but alas none to be seen.
373,AMAZING,Going to the park is always fun. We discover different areas each time. I highly recommend taking at least a full day.
374,"Joshua Tree National Park, off Interstate Hwy 10, California.","We spent an afternoon/evening and the following morning exploring the park. That worked out great. Got to explore and watch the sunset on the first day. Returned the early morning of the second day to a nice quiet park with great stops and scenery. Some of the cactus and many of the wildflowers were in bloom during our visit, which was our reason for visiting. Overall, a nice experience."
375,Gorgeous view of nature,"A great day out.... highly recommended. We called in at The National Park Visitor Centre as you pull onto to Park Blvd...paid for our $30 vehicle ticket, had a bathroom break and bought water. Chatted to a guy behind the counter who drew on the provided map where he thought we should visit (he was knowledgeable). The scenery is like nowhere else I’d seen. A photographers dream. The rocks, blue sky and weird trees all provide a great backdrop.  We had only travelled from Palm Springs (50 mins away) but would have travelled further."
376,Day trip,"We came at the height of summer, 38-40C but we didn’t find it that bad. We entered the park at the south entrance and drove up to the north. This way we got to drive through the whole park which was beautiful, although more hikes and sights are north. Driving through and stopping along the road to take photos. Beautiful trees and boulders along the way. watch out for bees at some stops!Come prepared with water, sunscreen and hats No phone signal or gas stations inside the park either. Don’t miss out on stargazing at night. Try to come when it’s not full moon so the sky is darker and stars shine out more."
377,"Great Park, good hiking/walking, visually stunning drives","Very impressed with the management of this park. They have visitors centers at every entrance, which are staffed with the most helpful folks. The younger guy helping us was so knowledgeable. They sell hats and water. STOCK UP. If you are there in Summer like us, pack as much water as you can..The entrance fee seems steep ($30 per car) but its well worth it. The park is extremely well maintained. They have well marked trails. The vista points along the road are great. Everything has been planned with attention to detail. Restrooms at each stop. I just wish they had vending machines or stalls selling cold water. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. JUST GO!!!"
378,Unbelievably beautiful ,"Our first visit was over 14 years ago.....this time was even better! We were based at an RV park in N. Palm Springs.......took 45 minutes to drive there and a bit more on  the trip back.ADORED Hidden Valley Walk......Cholla Gardens was a definite schlepp........and the Oasis of Mara was an interesting story,It's a great time of year to go.......everything is blooming!125 miles round trip from N. Palm Springs.Enjoy............................."
379,Lovely park!,"In spite of the Government Shutdown the gates to this park were still open on Monday January 7.  Our group was thankful for this because it was the last stop on our journey through California.  For most our group this was our first visit to a desert area, and the beauty of the trees, cacti, rocks and mountains were breath taking.  We drove from the North gates where the  Joshua Trees are located to the South gates stopping to capture photos at various stop points.  We only had a three hour span to journey through the park and even at leisurely pace of driving it was doable.  We did one short hike as well. Some parts of the park were gated off, but it didn’t effect the overall experience. I would recommend checking daily during the shutdown to see if the gates are open.  This is a must do activity if you are in this area of California."
380,quick spin through a park,"We had a great day at Joshua Tree, but should have dressed for it. It was freezing! We entered at the south entrance off the I-10 and drove through to the top. We had some mini hikes due the cold but still really glad we visited."
381,Wonderful,"Not impressed.  I’ve been to so many national parks and this one is, by far, the worst I’ve been to.  For the life of me, I can’t understand why this made the cut for National Park status."
382,A pleasant single-day road trip ,"Ok, we did not spend enough time in the park but what little time we spent was wonderful. We entered Joshua Tree NP at the south end from I-10; drove north; turned left onto Park Blvd; and exited the west entrance at Joshua Tree CA. We spent the first few miles learning what to look for. We were not sure what a Joshua Tree looked like. We had seen a few wild flowers alongside I-10; but once inside the park we were treated to fields of wildflowers. Soon we were pulling off the road to take pictures. Then we saw a Joshua Tree; then one in bloom; then a forest of a Joshua Trees. Fortunately, I had two cameras: one with a 300mm lens and one for wide shots. It was quite fun switch cameras while my daughter drove the car. I will go back. Suggestions: allow lots of time to explore the park and we found James Kaiser’s book, Joshua Tree: The Complete Guide: Joshua Tree National Park very useful."
383,A beautiful park not to be missed,"I was upset when I read of vandalism during the government shutdown, an off road vehicle mowing down an unprotected tree.  This area was roped off from visitors when we walked through, and plenty of trees looked vibrant, thankfully.  They grow nowhere else but in this arid dessert.  Climate change will take them out eventually, so I appreciate seeing them now.  The rocks and other growing things throughout make one realize how alive the dessert is and how obligated we are to tread lightly.  The place is amazing."
384,Interesting,"If you are in the area of even a two hour drive away, don't miss this heavenly place, it's almost up there with the Grand Canyon. Eat at the ""Natural Sisters""."
385,"Special, spiritual & Serene",This was my favourite place so far in Palm Springs.  It’s definitely worth a visit.  Pack a lunch or snacks and enjoy the day.  Hike through Jumbo Rocks or wherever you want!  There are a bunch of places to get lost!
386,A very special place ✨,Spent the day in the park could have easily spent a week but didn’t have the time. Had a great time  Learned a lot  wife had never been there before she was super impressed. With everything but the bathroom she had to use in a campsite. She said it looked as if it hadn’t been cleaned since the government shutdown last year
387,Joshua Tree National Park - Breathtaking,"We had a day out in Joshua Tree National Park, which was a lot cooler than Palm Springs where we were staying due to the altitude.We did 4 hikes of variable lengths, saw some great sights and had a picnic in the park, before coming out at the other end.Lovely place to hike around and very quiet too as it’s that big"
388,Stunning,There is so much beauty in this desert park. Allow yourself at least a couple of days or more! We entered through the main entrance and mapped out our 2 days. Take plenty of water and snacks. Prepare with layers of clothes if needed. Don't forget sunscreen- even in the winter!
389,Beautiful but too hot to do much walking,"My wife and I spent a whole day here. We drove from Palm Springs (about a 75 minute drive). We started at the Cottonwood entrance in the southern part of the park. We drove through the entire park and stopped along the way at different scenic points and did a few short walks. Highlights were Key Views (5,000 feet with amazing views), Cholla cactus garden and all the incredible Joshua trees. There is so much to see - you could spend days if you wanted to. It took about 3 hours to drive through with many stops along the way. There are tons of great hiking trails. Plenty of bathrooms along the way. Highly recommend visiting. It is truly beautiful."
390,Scenic,As luck would have it we did a day trip the first day of the government shout down so we weren't charge the $30 entry fee but that was just a bonus. The Joshua tree is magnificent and the landscape was breathtaking. I'm in a wheelchair but found there was plenty to do and see.
391,Very interesting,"Access: 3 hours or less from Los Angeles. Three entrances, west and north entrances accessible from yucca Valley or 29 Palms. The neglected south entrance is accessed from Interstate 10 well east of Palm Springs.What to do: Camping several campgrounds, none with RV hookups or water.Group camps are available, my favorite for scout or large family gatherings is at sheep’s pass group campsites, there are just two, and no regular camping, depending on your group, reserve both for privacy and absence of neighbors.Picnics: Several day use only areas have paved parking, bbq stands and picnic tables.Hiking: miles of trails are available. Be skilled in route finding, map and compass, and take extra water. It is easy to get lost in Joshua Tree without the usual landmarks. If you plan any off trail time, wear gloves, granite here is not far away from a cheese grater in texture.ClimbingFascinating rocks abound. If you rock climb there are 6,000 routes here. There is a climbing shop near the visitors center before the west entrance.Keys View: The San Andreas Fault can be plainly observed here! Amazing! on a haze free day the Coachella Valley and the Salton Sea are visible. Go!Flowers:  if there is the right winter rain, early spring can bring near carpet like color to an otherwise mostly barren desert.Star gazing: a summer moonless night brings clear views of the Milky Way Galaxy. JT is far enough from LA light pollution, and has an elevation of about 4,000 feet.Temperature: Yes hot in summer and daytime pleasant on most winter days, but be prepared to cope with desert temperature swings of 40 degrees.Facilities: Flush Toilets at west and south entrances only. Before Joshua Tree was a national Park it was a National Monument. No water, food, gas or accommodations inside the park.Quie"
392,Oh my Joshua Tree,"I am not what you would call a national park kind of person but I heard so much about this one that we went while vacationing in Palm Springs and glad we did.  The park is massive and never expected to see so many joshua trees.  There are the trees, wildlife, rocks and amazing views. At the suggestion of the park ranger we drove up to Keys View and you can see the panoramic Coachella Valley and all its splendor.  Wish we had more time there; it was a 10!"
393,Fun! ,My husband and I were in LA for a few days and we took one of our days and went to Joshua Tree.  It was mid October and the weather was sunny by not scorching hot.  The drive around the park is very nice and there are plenty of places to stop for a hike.  We were there all day and we loved it.
394,"Unique and beautiful Joshua Tree, a National Park","We went with our five year old at 7 am on a Saturday to go rock climbing with Mojave Guides. It was super hot by the 11:00 am, and know that 95 degrees in the high desert feels a lot different that 95 degrees in the Midwest. I overpacked snacks and hydration packs, and am glad I did. We had planned to hike after our climb, but 3 hours was enough for our five year old. It is a landscape wonderland of cacti, Joshua trees, and an assortment of desert animals (saw snake, lizards, jack rabbits, etc.)"
395,Amazing!,"I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 as I felt it wasn’t right that a car of US seniors gets in for $20 but non US citizens have to pay $30!  The cost is also per car and the ticket is valid for 7 days - there were only 2 of us and we only had 5 hours to spend there so it wasn’t as good value for us as it could be for others. Having said the negatives, the rest is wholly positive. There are amazing views and well marked trails.  We walked the Lost Horse Loop which was about 6 miles (and then extra to get to and from the car - as the car park was full). It was a lovely hike with 3 different ‘sections’ of scenery - looking out to flat, barren desert; lots of different bushes and then an area of Joshua trees. There’s an old mine to see after about 2 miles. It starts with quite a bit of gentle uphill but finishes with a long stretch of sandy, flat area."
396,Great place at susnet,"Unlike NPs in Utah, NPs in CA did not provide any visitor service. However, my visit was very pleasant. The road throughout the NP was well paved and there are a lot of shoulders to pull over and get off from the vehicle, take picture and/or appreciate the nature. However, I highly recommend to download offline google map of the region so that you can navigate yourself even without the internet service, which is a typical thing in NPs in the US. Allow yourself at least a half day, or full day if you have a plan to do some serious hikes. The park is huge. For the people with limited physical abilities, I think spending time mainly around the North-West part of the park is ideal."
397,Surreal Experience at Joshua Tree,"There is a lot to do at Joshua Tree.  There are quite a few hikes, some are easy and some a little more difficult.There are a number of places that you can do rock climbing or bouldering.The plants are pretty neat, most notably are the Joshua Trees themselves.There are several visitors centers, and many pullouts along the road.There is no cell service in the park, and no water beyond the visitors centers.  Most of the trailheads have restrooms."
398,VERY BEAUTIFUL & UNUSUAL NATIONAL PARK: MUST VISIT TO APPRECIATE!,"We just came back from Joshua Tree.  As we told people along the trip down there that we were headed there, they were very impressed!  When we got there, I could see why :)The park is beautiful and the vistas are stunning.I would recommend that you account for the distances within the parks given that it is best to drive slowly (given the beauty, 30 miles/hour is a treat).  We took the West Entrance in and, as were leaving on a Friday, there was a line of cars trying to get in.  Even though a number of “first come, first serve” campsites, we ran into at least 2 to 3 people driving around looking for a place to stay so my advice would be to book in advance (of course, it was Memorial Day weekend so need to take that into account).  We had a tiny bit of trouble with the altitude even though we estimate the hikes took place at 4500 feet."
399,to be seen !!,"About an hour away from Palm Springs, we entered from the south and stopped at the Visitors Entrance to get a map and our bearings. From there we stopped to see the Cholla Cactus Garden, an incredible sight, followed by Skull Rock (mobbed by crowds) and a quick hike at Discovery Trail (just ok), Cap Rock Loop (terrific), and Key Views (hazy but beautiful). We exited from the western entrance about 3.5-4 hours later. This park is very doable in one day, and we were glad to have seen it. Note that you must bring in your own food and water - nothing (not even water fountains) can be found within the park itself."
400,Absolutely fabulous National Park,Easy park to enjoy as you can easily drive around and just go to view points if you want to. There are plenty of treks if you wish to do any and camping. No facilities in park at all apart from a few hole in the ground toilets with no hand sanitizer. The Joshua trees are cute and the smooth rocks quite different to look at. You are allowed to climb on them so good park for children too. The view from the keys was spectacular all over the Coachella valley and not to be missed.
401,"Rocks, Cacti & Joshua Trees - And lots of them","It was February and warm in the Coachella Valley.  Joshua Tree was windy and pretty cold, but it didn't spoil our times.  We took about 2 hours driving through the Park, came out near the town of Joshua Tree, far from where we began.  If you are in the area, it's a must go.  I wish I could stay over night to see the dark and starry shy.  Not only the trees, but the piles of rocks, were fascinating.  I loved the Visitor Center by the Valley entrance (South I think).  They even had a first aid kit at one turnout, warning visitors to not cuddle the cacti."
402,One of My Favorite National Parks: Joshua Tree Natiional Park,"Excellent way to spend the day. Can take anywhere between 2-5 hours to get through the park depending on number of stops. Highlights include Keys View (must see), Cap Rock trail and the Cholla Cactus Garden"
403,Great place for spend a day,"We have driven by here many time and never went in until today. We always thought as we drove by all there was cactuses. Man we we wrong. There are a lot of Joshua trees but a whole lot of other scenery. There are many trails to hike, rocks to climb and beautiful scenery to see. There are a lot of neat rock formations to see and to hike too. I would highly recommend stopping here and explore."
404,"Cool, unique National Park experience","Expecting temperatures in the low 100's, we entered the park by 8:30 starting at the visitor center on the northside.  The staff was very knowledgeable and gave us detailed directions for how to enjoy the park.  We spent only a brief time looking at the exhibits due to the temperatures increasing.  We did a few short hikes of about 15 minutes each to manage the heat exploring the Cholla Cactus Garden, Jumbo Rocks, and Keys View (which was Wow!) The Joshua trees were plentiful! We ate lunch under some shade at the Hidden Valley campground.  We spent about 4 hours exploring the park and was glad we had brought food and plenty of water.  Tennis shoes were fine to hike in. We exited on the west entrance into the town of Joshua Tree.  We would love to come back to camp and to see the spring wildflowers!  It was great to see the park with lower crowds though!"
405,All in a day,"This was the first time my wife and I had ever visited JTNP, even though it is about 3 hours drive from our home and we've been living in Southern California for 40+ years.  To be honest, we are glad that we came and enjoyed our 2 days here.  There are various activities that JTNP would attract:  Rock Climbers, trail hikers, photographers, desert people, as well as being in a totally different environment than what one is used to, as well a quiet environment.  We liked some of the tree shapes, formed by the land and wind.There's enough different rock formations, formed by erosion, wind, earthquakes, and water.It's further, but the Cholla Cactus Garden, where the Teddybear Cacti grows near the Pinto Basin, is very unusual.  If you got time, well worth seeing it, as you do not see it anywhere else in the Park.Its history is also very interesting, and what people have done in its past.A bit of warning and preparation:  Depending on the season, be prepared for (extreme) heat and/or cold.  Layered clothing is very handy, and should have plenty of water and snacks.  Make sure car is in good condition, battery A-OK, gassed-up.  Cell phone service may not be available.We went during the government shutdown, and was prepared with our own toiletries and plastic bags ... just in case.  We normally carry an 'emergency kit' in our car anyway, sweatshirts, jackets, day's change of clothing, flashlights, jumper cables, toolkit  ... We also told people where we were and the anticipated routes that we were taking, and approximate time when we would be back.... just in case.  Call me a 'worry-wart' ... or a Boy Scout!We anticipate that we'll be back in a few years to visit areas that we did not see this time."
406,Possesses a special beauty,"Whether you have a whole day or just a couple of hours, heading to Joshua Tree National Park is a complete must. Park rangers at the west entrance are eager to point out short or long trails to walk, places to stop for vista views and to chat up the uniqueness the park has to offer. If time is a limit, there is an hour long drive which will take you from one side of the park to another, with many side pull offs to stop and take pictures. It’s also just as easy to spend an entire day walking some of the many trails  available. Note: there is a park entrance fee which is good for 7 days."
407,Enjoyable visit,"We visited Joshua Tree while staying in Palm Springs in mid-July. Earlier in the day we drove down to Slab City and the Salton Sea. After a long day of driving we finally made it up the plateau and into Joshua Tree. It’s pretty unassuming coming in. You turn off a local highway and drive through a residential area. There’s a ranger stand and a small info center that we did not go into. The streets are wonderfully maintained. The park is clean. It is a stunning sight, Joshua trees everywhere, boulders stacked on top of one another as if they’d been placed there or fell onto each other. It was a partly cloudy day but it was still over 100F in the valley below. It was easily 25-30F cooler in the park. The weather seemed to match the ground ecosystem that day because the wetter weather stayed to our north and we left dry after 2 hours in the park. Joshua Tree is famous for being at the convergence of two desert ecosystems. It is where the Colorado and Mojave deserts meet (I believe). This clash of climes creates one of the most spectacular and unusual sights I have ever seen. The nominal trees are everywhere. But more than the trees, the rock formations are amazing. I’ve read that Joshua Tree is a great place for winter bouldering and I can see why. The boulders and rocks are extremely rounded, eroded, cliff-like but they don’t rise very tall. They are very alien. They are stacked against one another or fly up into the sky as if they’ve been stuck in the ground by a giant. We did not do any trails on that day but if I go back I would like to hike. I think shoulder seasons would be best, you avoid any monsoon season that may affect the area and also any weather extremes that you might not expect. If you are in south central California, Joshua Tree is a must!"
408,Loved JT NP,"We drove out here last week from LaQuinta.  It was a cold day.  In the very low 50's. And the wind was blowing.  Brrrrrrrr . . . it was so COLD!!  However, if you've never been to Joshua Tree National Park and you're in the area, don't miss it.  This is the kind of natural beauty that you just don't find anywhere else.  We drove in at the Cottonwood entrance and motored on straight through to the Twentynine Palms exit on the north end.  Given how cold it was, we only took a few brief stops, along the way.  Note:  if you come this way, there really isn't anything  to ""see,"" for about 25-30 minutes.  But don't let that discourage you.  The payoff is worth the drive.A few highlights:  the acres of Cholla Cacti, Huge Boulders and, of course, the Joshua Trees. It was just too bad that the weather kept us away from some of the other sights. So, we have a very good reason to go back here again!Travel tip:  if you come here and exit up north, take Highway 62 going into Twentynine Palms and through Joshua.  There are some interesting things to see, including acres of Joshua Trees. Also, if you continue on the way into the Palm Springs area, you're going to see an unbelievable sight:  all the windmills against the backdrop of the San Bernardino Mountains.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Just keep your eyes on the road, please.  It's mesmerizing!"
409,This was our 3rd time....and we live in UK!,Love this place especially the western part. Best time is late afternoon or sunset. Would SO like to visit at night too. Key’s View’s definitely worth a detour off the main road.
410,Great visit,"This NP was on my radar now for a few years. We finally got a chance to check it out. It's a huge and gorgeous NP. The staff at the visitors center were very friendly and knowledgeable.  There were a variety of trails and gems to expierence. We travelled from the North and made our way  through, eventually exiting at the South entrance. The views are stunning. Some of our favorites were Skull Rock and Cholla Garden. There are way too many to list.  The Oasis at the end would've been neat to check out  except, it was getting dark and some of the area was closed. All in all, I'd love to go back and explore more of one of our Nations great NP's."
411,Wonderful Park even in off season.,"First I'll say this, desert is not my preference as it feels too much like nature's poverty to me.  I realize that many disagree.  Having said that, don't miss this park if you are in the area.  It really is an interesting spot on our planet.  I didn't walk much due to a knee problem but drove around quite a lot and thoroughly enjoyed the unusual trees, beautiful sky and scenery."
412,JOSHUA Tree National park,"I should start by puting my rating in perspective. I've been to a number of NPs so I've scored it according to how it ranks amongst others I've been to. I will say it deserves to be a NP due to it's uniqueness. The Joshua tree is unique as well as so many of the rock formations. But it sort of ends there. Once you've seen part of it, you've seen most of it. There's not a lot of diversity. There are lots of Joshua trees and lots of rocks. If you plan to spend in time in the Palm Springs area, it's worth your time. For those who have given the park an excellent rating, I don't get it. Perhaps they've never been to Zion or Grand Canyon."
413,Day out,"We were not there to experience an overnight visit. So, the several hours of hiking  we did was enough for us. We even managed playing a few rocks without getting hurt. Tennis shoes were enough footwear for us. Of course, the Joshua trees themselves made the visit worthwhile"
414,Stunning Desert Beauty,"Decided we were going to have our Christmas dinner here since I needed a break from Chicago. Even tho there is a government shut down, the park is open. No rangers or assistance available if you decide to visit during this time, so tread respect fully and sensibly, please. There was no line waiting to get in and traffic seemed to be not an issue. I did notice that the parking lots were full and people were parking on the side of the road, which is normally a no-no. Truth, I've never seen the park so busy before, so maybe the lack of entry fee persuaded many more to come out enjoy the rocks. But, I did not see anyone behaving badly, so our visit was as amazing as always. I've been to Joshua Tree about 5 times now in past 5 years, and every time is just as mesmerizing as the first time.There trails for all types to explore. Which is one of the nice things about this place. Be sure to wear good walking or hiking shoes to explore as there is light gravely trails with little rocks that can get stuck in flats or sandals. Rocks are very easy to climb, almost welcoming for you to explore.It can get windy here..and nights are chilly.So come prepared with layers to make your stay more enjoyable.There are rest areas w bathrooms, but can be spread apart, so be aware. But with shutdown, I cant say the status of the bathrooms as I didnt use any while there.What we did do was bring our Christmas dinner here, do some hiking and then enjoy our feast. A most memorable holiday in a beautiful place filled with such cool geology, you'll think your in the Flintstones.Go here, hang out in the boulders, look around and relax in a special place."
415,UNIQUELY BEAUTIFUL,"When our kids were younger, we did a 3-week driving trip from the east coast out to Utah and then back to the east coast, and we visited a lot of National Parks along the way.  So many, in fact, that the kids said they were sick of seeing trees and rocks.  Well, here at Joshua Tree National Park, despite the name, you get both - trees AND rocks!Driving through the park was a lovely way to spend a few hours - there's lots to see that you won't see elsewhere. ( We had a roadrunner cross in front of us as we were waiting to pay our entrance fee).  There's real rock climbing that goes on here, but there are also lots of opportunities for those of us not up for the real stuff (whether too old, too young, or not fit enough) to get up close and personal in the landscape as well."
416,Glimpse of the desert,We were happy to drive through and make a couple of stops. I don't see the need to stop everywhere.I fantastic afternoon trip!
417,Beautiful wilderness.....,"I have always wanted to see Joshua. I was not disappointed.  The scenery is unexplainable  You have to visit to see it.  Take your time during your visit.  It is desert so bring plenty of water, especially if hiking. I recommend going early."
418,Beautiful Desert,"Any review of Joshua Tree NP won’t due it justice. You simply must go and see it in order to appreciate its beauty. My family and I went for two half-day hikes in late December, when the weather was sunny and cool (40s to low 50s).  One day, we entered by the West Entrance Station and hiked near Hidden Valley. The second day, we entered on the other side of the park and hiked near Cottonwood Spring. The hiking was fairly easy, although we could have easily chosen more challenging paths to take. The landscape was picturesque.  There is much to see and explore. Anyone who enjoys hiking will find something special about this park."
419,Great Adventure and Great Beauty Everywhere ,"If you prefer to enjoy nature from the comfort of your climate controlled car, you can easily spend a couple of hours driving the Park boulevard, please make sure to make som pit stops."
420,Amazing!!!,"This park will not disappoint. If you don’t climb, you can observe the climbers. There are good hiking trails. Plan to drive the whole way through the park to enjoy the variety of terrain. The cholla garden is prickly beauty and worth seeing. If you are lucky enough to be there in the early spring, the wildflowers near Cottonwood Canyon are stunning. Campgrounds need to be reserved way ahead of the trip. There are not many places to have a picnic. It is a desert after all."
421,Visit with family,"Went in via the West Entrance after getting some advice at the visitors centre (well worth it - and while you’re there, stop in at the cafe next door for some fresh healthy sandwiches).There is so much to see and do at the park and the loop takes just under an hour with no stops.We stopped and did the Hidden Valley Walk, drove up to the Keys Lookout, and finished with a quick look at Skull Rock.Tip: if you’re heading to the Grand Canyon straight after, get some petrol in town first before leaving Joshua Tree."
422,Unexplainable ,"Most important:- gas up before you go, half tank min from the entrance - it’s a 2 hour driving commitment once in the park so leave yourself time- bring lots of water and some snacks- sunscreen- plan your day as there is lots to seeHighly recommend Hidden Valley trail, it was incredible and accessible for all ages. Skull Rock, Cholla Trees and Cactus Gardens were also a must-see. A day was not enough, we needed more time. That being said, we had an incredible time and saw a ton of the natural wonder in the park. Definitely a bucket list item you’ll need to cross off."
423,Beautiful Scenery and Weather,"I drove to Joshua Tree from San Diego on a Saturday morning.  It took me 3 hours to drive to the Cottonwood visitor center.I picked up a map and asked which hikes are for novice hikers.  The Ranger circled the areas for me.Before you go.....make sure you have a full tank of gas and plenty of water and snacks.  Good hiking shoes, a hat and sunscreen, sunglasses. This is a must in summer.It is about a 2.5 hour drive through the park if don’t stop to hike and just want to drive through.  It’s a paved road with pull outs and lots of campgrounds and hiking opportunities.Lots of picnic areas, but only bathrooms at campgrounds.  Don’t touch the cactus! I really enjoyed the Cholla Cactus Garden, there is a trail and you need to stick to the trail or your might get stuck by a mean looking cactus.The Jumbo Rocks are very interesting and people were climbing them but you need good shoes or be a goat.I didn’t realize this desert is made up of two deserts, the Colorado Desert and the Mojave Desert.  The each offer very unique landscapes.It looks like Spring would offer more colors and cooler temps.  I saw lots of fading pink and yellow flower bushes.   The fields of Joshua trees makes for interesting photos.  I had a great sky with beautiful clouds and it was a great day to enjoy nature.  Glad I had my hat, sunglasses and sunscreen."
424,Amazing!,"So much to see. Recommend visiting the visitor centre before entering the park. They will give you some tips of what to see. Note - there is no cell signal in the park - bring a map. However, there is one thing they don’t seem to want to tell you - where to find the heart rocks. They guy we spoke at the visitor centre - ignored our question completely. Nonetheless there was lots to see - barker dam, key view point, skull rock, cap rock, split rock and arch rock. Lots of places for hiking and exploring. But we found that some signage is lacking - we stopped at a turnout call - “hall of horrors”. But there were no signs at the entrance by the parking lot to explain why it was called such. ... so we didn’t get out to explore. Overall it was a good day out."
425,Beautiful ,"There are so many trails, it was difficult to chose one. We didn't get to hike as much as we had wished, but the trail heads and trails are well marked. The rock formations are amazing, the views from the high points in the trail are breathtaking and the flora still blooming in November was surprising."
426,Beautiful park,"We spent one-and-a-half days here over President’s Day weekend. It was a great experience. We entered each day through the Twentynine Palms entrance. The Oasis visitor center there is a real gem and my family had an excellent experience with all who worked there, including the rangers who were extremely helpful. They signed our kids up for the Junior Rangers program which was fantastic and gave them some things to learn and observe in the park. Afterwards, they discussed what they learned with a ranger and were inducted, receiving a badge. They were thrilled. On day one we spent some time hiking, climbing boulders, and just generally seeing as much as we could. The views are breathtaking and highly varied. There is so much to see!We took a break for dinner and came back around 9 o’clock to do some stargazing. I’ve never seen so many stars. It was incredible. Highlights were skull rock and the cactus garden.  Most enjoyable of all, though, was just stopping at random pull-offs and exploring. My pre-teens had low expectations (especially coming directly from Disneyland), but after exploring our first stop, they were enthralled.  I highly recommend this park!"
427,Different from The Grand Canyon & Yosemite,"Our group departed San Diego around 8:30, took the scenic highway route with a stop in Julian, CA, passed the Salton Sea, and entered in the south entrance to the park. The ranger station there is quite nice within facilities.  It’s an easy, relaxing drive with as many stops as you want to make through the two deserts. It probably took us 1 hour to drive to the north entrance. We then had an easy drive to Palm Springs for dinner before the early February sunset. We took the interstate for a quick trip back to San Diego."
428,Wow-even in the summer!,"My wife and I went to the park two days and spent a good bit of time there exploring. We chose to go in the evening and into the night to avoid the heat of the day. This allowed us to see the amazing sunsets and the wide open sky at night. Star viewing is just amazing here. We had a 4-wheel drive, so we took the Geology Tour Road which I would highly recommend. Many of the trails were just the perfect length to do several in a day. The Hidden Springs trail and the Barker Dam trail were probably the best during the day. Many of the trails were good for night hiking also. So glad we got this experience!"
429,Catch the sunset,We have been in the area many times on our trips to and from Palm Springs and decided yesterday to take a detour and visit Joshua Tree National Park.  Our annual park pass had to days remaining. and we had no pressing plans at home so why not.The place is uniquely beautiful with all of  the Joshua Trees and boulders.We love National Parks and are glad we stopped.
430,Unique Experience,"Wow! This is so much more than we expected. As the name implies, yes there are Joshua Trees, but there are beautiful animals (we saw Long Horn Sheep), rocks to climb, and trails to explore. Bring LOTS of water!!! No kidding here. And a floppy hat to cover your face which will get burned. Be sure to visit the various Visitor Centers for great history of the parks, and come back at night to star gaze. Magnificent!"
431,Highlight of Palm Springs trip,"Both walks are worthwhile, with the hike to the old gold mill being twice as long as the hike to the dam, it seems. Plus there is more sand to walk in going to the mill. The grave headstone has been moved to further down the trail due to vandals. Dont miss the rusted out cars around the mill; there is one almost hidden in some bushes under a tree. Between the two walks, I recommend the one to the dam if you dont have time for both."
432,Quite unique ,"We had no issues getting in. They didn’t charge us either because of the shutdown. Normally it looked like $30. We saw a few rangers around, but the park was pretty empty.  Didn’t see any signs of vandalism where we were, thankfully."
433,Unique and Well Worth the Trip,This nat'l forest was on my bucket list and it did not disappoint.  We entered from the south entrance-no problem with lines getting in--loved all the different topography of the forest from the Cholla forest to the rock formations to the Joshua tree--we spent 5 hours here and i enjoyed every moment!!!
434,I live in Joshua Tree and love it.  The park is amazing!!!,"We spent the day at the park yesterday. So much to take in! Flowering plants everywhere! This is a great time to see the park and hike. Temps were in the 70's. Don't miss the cactus patch, the split rock trail  hike, and the Keys View. What a site."
435,A must see!!,"I was so excited to go here and I have wanted to go for awhile .... it is actually really confusing - if your traveling east you enter the park from a different direction and drive close to an hour through the park to get to the “entrance” in Twentynine Palms.  Also, for being JOSHUA TREE National Park I have seen more Joshua Tree’s on the Joshua Tree Highway outside of Wickenburg, AZ.  They do have some great rocks for bouldering around a bit though, but as for backcountry and hiking .... did I miss something?"
436,Breathtaking,With some extra time off during the holidays we decided to visit Joshua Tree for the first time. We entered through the south gate just past Indio to avoid any lines. Arrived around 10am and got through with no problem. The park landscape is amazing. As you move north to the higher desert elevation you can see the landscape change. Soon we even saw traces of snow and shortly thereafter the entire park was covered in up to 2 feet of snow. Not what we were expecting at all.Made the hike to the arch through the snow and then stopped up past the big rocks for some great snow experience. Took the exit at the NW through Joshua Tree and there was a pretty long line to enter and exit the park. I would recommend seeing both the higher and lower desert regions to get the whole experience.
437,Even perfect just to cruise by !,"If you're in L.A. and looking for something different to do then hire a car and take a drive to the park.It's only a couple of hours at mist out of town and definatley worth a visit. The scenery is amazing. Totally amazing.You can approach the park from different entrances. I recommend the NW for best stops and view.Ensure you have suitable clothing, sun protection and water. We took a picnic because there's nothing on offer in the park.The scenery is breath taking. You simply have to go to experience it.I'd like to return at sun up or sun set to make some great pictures...."
438,Don't miss this. Just don't.,"We actually didn't originally plan to go to Joshua Tree National Park. It was good fortune that we went. Absolutely beautiful. There are actually two deserts in the park. The low-desert to the south and high-desert to the north. The high-desert (Mojave) is where the Joshua Trees are. The tree is an absolute marvel of nature. Along with the trees, there are stunning rock formations and desert flora. Not far from Palm Springs. Take your camera...don't miss it."
439,Awe inspiring Park,We were not sure how long it would take but found out if we came into the West Entrance and drove south all the way to Cottonwood Visitor Center it would take about 2 to 2.5 hours depending on traffic.  We did this route and stopped twice to take pictures and it took 2.5 hours.  We got into the park around 10 am and left around 12:30 pm.  Plenty of bathroom stops along the way.  Easy pull offs as well.  They have a Free shuttle that takes you around as well if you don't want to drive into the park.  If we took the Entrance Station and drove the loop up to Oasis Visitor Center they said it would take about 2.5 hours.  Because we were heading back to Phoenix Airport we took the route that was shorter.  The ranger also said if we took the Oasis Visitor center to Cottonwood Visitor Center it was the shortest route that could be done in 1.5 hours or so...again depending on traffic. The rocks were unbelievable and in Visitor Center you can learn about them. Each Visitor center has bathrooms and gift shops!
440,It’s home,"But longer would be even better! The wait was a littke long, both going in and coming out, and though crowded at the entry, the crowds were not noticeable once in the park. Can’t wait to come back, but maybe within my dogs next time!"
441,Great Park ,"In the month we were in the area we visited the park 3 times, and having been many times over the last 20 years we still find new things to see and trails to explore. 3 Visitor centres, one at each entrance, each have a nice short trail nearby but try to drive through the whole park to see the change in the landscape from one side to the other, the Joshua Tree's are fabulous and more abundant in the northern parts and the rock fields are tremendous. My favourite trail is the short 'Hidden Valley' it's like another world ! Whatever you do go early to get the best out of your day is this special place"
442,Amazing!,"First, all fitness levels are welcome. You can drive through the entire park and stop along the way so don't be intimidated by friends and strangers who post pics of themselves standing atop impossibly large boulders. You don't need to climb to get here.Second, if you can, rent a convertible. Third, if you are faced with a long line at the main entrance as we were, simply drive approx. 15 minutes down the road and use the next entrance. We got in zippy quick and you can get through the entire park regardless of which entrance you use. There is a reason people make pilgrimages to Joshua Tree, go and find out why."
443,A day to remember!,This is quite a long trip from Palm Springs (5-6hours) but worth it.The dessert is unusual and the park well conserved.You must go to Keys View - only a short detour from the main road through the National Park
444,Just WOWZAAAAAAA,"Initially we planned to enter and leave using the south entrance, but eventually decided to enter from Joshua Tree and exit using the south entrance.  We are really glad we chose this route.  The two sides of the park are quite different and we wouldn't have seen nearly as many interesting sites if we had only visited one side of the park.  The day of our visit was windy, but we were still able to see quite a bit. It is a beautiful and unique park--well worth a visit."
445,Fantastic and unusual place,"My wife and I visited the park on a Saturday in November.  We arrived around 2pm and only had a few hours till sunset.  There is so much to see and do that my biggest regret is not budgeting enough time.  The park is huge and would be awesome to spend time hiking there.This area is unlike almost any other place in the US.  The landscape is amazingly raw and vital.  The Joshua Trees are not done justice in any photography I've seen - they are startlingly beautiful in real life.  If you realize how long it takes them to grow - 70+ years to mature and they can last for over 500 years...  There is one really interesting section I noticed while driving through the park - as you are ascending at one point all the Joshua Trees just disappeared.  Wide open areas with none growing.   My first thought was that maybe they died out, or we were too high up for them to grow.  It turns out they were burned by settlers for firewood back in the mid-1800s.  The trees STILL haven't repopulated the area that was devestated.  That puts the age of the trees into a great perspective.  I would strongly advise a trip to the park - just remember you need a car pass if you are driving in there.  It is a 7 day pass for only $30.  Well worth it.  Just budget as much time as you can."
446,Big rocks and weird trees,"We drove in from AZ and thought it odd that there was no entry booth. For the first hour, we didn’t see any Joshua trees. However, we did see so many incredible sights! The cholla cactus garden and rock formations were incredible! We saw lots of jack rabbits and a coyote. Then, we drove into the second half of the park and found groves of Joshua trees! The views were spectacular! On our way out, there was a booth and we purchased our National Park Pass for the year (which included our admission to JTNP). Well worth the visit!"
447,5th Visit,"We left Vegas and drove for a long while to get there... crossing the Mohave Desert was quite interesting. The entrance fee is $35 to enter the park. Saw a lot of very cool trees, rocks and plants too. Highly recommend going if you’re in the area. Be sure to have plenty of gas. There is a station that was $4.99/gallon, then twenty nine palms has plenty of stations to choose from to refill."
448,A must visit!,Unfortunately the day we planned to visit was during the government shutdown so we didn’t know what to expect.  If you drive in from the southern entrance there isn’t much to see for about 45 minutes but once you get further north the views are great and I highly recommended a visit.
449,Beautiful by day and the stars at night!,"Arrived a little while after the shutdown, but everything was all back in order. The rangers that we had interactions with were quite helpful. The whole park is a wondrous place. Like nothing I've seen before, and I've done a little travelling. The differences right within the park are an interesting experience. Only spent most of a day there, but certainly worth the drive to get there and experience this different landscape."
450,Must see,"I visited Joshua Tree National Park for the second time this past weekend. Both times I thought I needed at least a week to complete an amazing journey. And its true. This park is other worldly. Its A phenomenal Vortex filled with climbing, hiking, camping, and photo fantasy that leaves you wanting more. If you have NOT visited this park, it must be on your bucket list. It is Mars on earth, and more."
451,A Jolly in the Joshua ,"This place has been on my bucket list of places to come too, and I’ve had the pleasure of being here twice. First time I came here 6/6/20 and again 7/2/20. My job allowed me this amazing experience and I will forever keep this memory. This place is so surreal, I honestly didn’t even know what to expect. There’s so much beauty in the desert. The trees are something in fairy tales as I’ve never seen anything like it before coming here. The people I encountered on my exploration were all super friendly as well. I didn’t get to hike as much as I didn’t prepare myself with the right attire and shoes, but I did get to explore some of its beauty. I highly recommend everyone to come here at least once in your life. It’s an awesome experience and you won’t regret it. Just make sure you have plenty of water with you if you do go hiking especially when the sun is out and it’s beaming directly on you. It gets hot quick. But still worth the trip."
452,Fascinating and Strangely Beautiful,"We went there a little late as the traffic was mad because of thanksgiving, but we made it before the sunset. The park is huge (nearly size of London) It's characterized by rugged rock formations and stark desert landscapes. Named for the region’s twisted, bristled Joshua trees, the park straddles the cactus-dotted Colorado Desert and the Mojave Desert, which is higher and cooler. Keys View looks out over the Coachella Valley. The ticket is per car and valid for 7 days.The night is beautiful as you can see the stars. So if you are a stargazer, you have found heaven!"
453,Fabulous!,"If you are nearby Palm Springs make sure you take a little drive up to the park. Avoid the midday hours during June through September as the temperature rgeta up in the 100’s degrees.This is an incredible and unique park over 63 miles long to explore. This last time I was there I just wanted to re-charge see some sites and I just drove around without doing any hiking.My favorite area to always visit is The Intersection Rock, known particularly among rock climbers as one of the most sought after and nicest looking rock formations in Joshua Tree.Also a great area to camp or just have a picnic. One of the climbers favorite destination at the park.Happy Travels !"
454,Well worth the trip!,"The best time to visit is when the weather is cool so much exploring can be done. If time allows, check out the 1/4 mile walk through the cholla garden. Also Skull Rock is a great stop. Pictures don't really display how massive this rock is. Scrambling, hiking, rock climbing, bicycling, and picnicking are all activities that are fun to do here."
455,Amazing landscapes to view from all over,"My wife and I, along with a friend of over 40-years, visited the Joshua Tree National Park together. We stayed over night in Indio, California. We then entered the park off California Interstate Hwy 10 East. The first thing we did was to go to the Cottonwood Visitor Center and got ourselves fully oriented to the park.My wife and I have visited many of our National Parks including the Grand Canyon. We totally loved the Joshua Tree National Park. Others are perhaps equal, but in our opinion, none were better. We just had that magical chemistry with the park.We spent 6-hours in the park, exiting at the Joshua Tree, California, Visitor Center.We loved the Joshua Trees. We really loved the amazing rock formations. We enjoyed Keys View and other side attractions (Cholla Garden etc). It was one great day and visit."
456,Excellent Place to Explore,"Strongly concur with the other savvy Trip Advisor Reviewers--this is a MUST see , especially on a Sunny comfortable day in the winter! Had no idea what a special place this is, unlike most other national parks--It was nice the rangers were back on duty after the government shutdown and there is now supervision to limit additional damage to the park.You will need at least two days to do it justice,if you want to sample a few of the excellent and varied hikes..  Drive the Loop, rock climb in Hidden Valley, drive up to the Keys Views Overlook, hike to Barker Dam-- And, if you are 62 or over you can get a Lifetime National Parks Pass on site for $80.00 (America The Beautiful)"
457,Like no place on earth,"We had spent the night close by so decided to explore this Park in the morning. We are so glad we did. It's very beautiful and diverse. You could spend days hiking and climbing or just enjoy a breathtaking morning like we did. Its stunningly beautiful.Highlights for us were a small hike at Hidden Valley, Key's View, and the Cholla cactus gardens. The short drive and hike to Keys View is so worthwhile. You could actually look over at the San Andreas fault. It was extremely windy at the view and I'm unsure if this is the norm but the view is fantastic. This is a National Park worth taking the effort to visit."
458,We prefer the east entrance but with a stop first at Station here,"Easy  to  get  to  from  Palm  Springs , less  than  a hour  drive  but  well  worth  it . Entrance  fee  is   $30  but  stop at  the  visitors  welcome  center  and  pick  up  a  map of  the  park . There's  a cafe  right  next  door  which  has  boxed  lunches  or you  can  go across  the  street  and  do  Subway . Lots  of  great  picnic  areas  and  great  hiking  trails . Park  has  lots  of  washroom  facilities , great  lookouts  and  the  park is  well  kept  up. Enjoying  the  outdoors , also  went  on  a  week day  since  weekends  can  be  very  busy"
459,Always a treat,"There are three entrances into JT, the busiest is the one in the south end called Cottonwood the most popular one on the northern side is Joshua Tree because it has a saloon nearby but our absolute favorite entrance was the Oasis Visitor Center because the layout allows for education and plenty of interaction with Park Rangers. 29 Palms and Joshua Tree the town have a plethora of Joshua Trees to admire. Once you are in the park you will probably notice there are very few Joshua Trees on your drive from the north entrance to the south. That’s because the majority of the trees are located in the jumbo rock to keys ranch area. Visit the Cholla Cactus area - we were blown away by the amount of cacti surrounding us. They often catch the light just perfect (especially at sunrise and sunset) and look like they are glowing!Everyday there are ranger led tours, check the website for the tours available and check any of the visitor centers for the location of the talks. A majority of the talks take place at skull rock, cap rock, Indian cove campground and at the main visitor center. Driving in the park - we visited on a weekday in March and had no issue finding parking at any of the sites and visitor centers but they do offer a FREE bus to take you around the park. I would suggest this if you have little ones as you can more easily point out things, take pictures and probably most importantly the driver will happily make sure you get where you want to go. Tips:There is no cellphone service, no water or food available inside the park. Be sure to prepare accordingly and always take a map of the park with you.The small loop from the Oasis entrance to the Joshua Tree entrance can take up to to two hours so be sure you have enough gas if you are driving yourself. The wild flowers are located past the Cottonwood entrance almost at the park’s edge. The largest concentration of Joshua Trees are found on Park Blvd near Jumbo Rocks, Hidden Valley, Barker Dam area. As well at the Black Rock area in the North West corner of the park. Want to watch climbers? Head to the Hall of Horrors.

460,Joshua Tree National Forest Park,"This one has been on the bucket list for a long time. It was scorchingly hot when we visited, but that didn't stop us from seeing nearly all we wanted to. Be sure to have water, water, water - and some food/snacks to sustain you through the day. We started at the North end and got as far as the Cholla Cactus Garden. It was a long, hot wonderful day of driving, short hikes and a million photographs, one more stunning than the next."
461,Never Disappoints,"We came in from the north side, paid a $20 fee per vehicle. There's a parking area where there are huge boulders. Some can be easily climbed and some are over 100ft high and require climbing equipment. There is another parking area at a high elevation which presents a view across the valley to Palm Springs. Great park."
