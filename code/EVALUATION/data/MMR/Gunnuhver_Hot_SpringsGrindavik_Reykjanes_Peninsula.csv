0,A Fair bit of walking required,"Be patient & you will be rewarded by the different types of geysers in the area. The restaurant(on the right) served fabulously cheap soups, very warming in the winter."
1,Amazing Hot Spring,The visit to the site with the guides is well worth it.  The are numerous springs coming out of the ground in the area along with one large guiser which explodes every few minutes.
2,Worth a stop,It's a geyser with volcanic rock all around it. The entire area is worth visiting as it depicts the geology of the country.
3,Day trip self drive ,This place is definitely worth a stop if you are travelling around the south west region. You can also walk or drive over to the lighthouse and cliffs.
4,Worth seeing!,"Definitely worth a visit, the landscape is very dramatic with the guises, the coast line, lighthouse and sea all coming together. It has an interesting little story of how a family set up home there, you can still see the foundations of the house. Also its well worth going 2 minutes down the road when you've done, there's a viewing platform where you can see naturally formed bathing pools and watch the waves crash against the shore."
5,Very cool natural wonder,We were the only ones here on our little outing and it was lovely...the smell wasn’t but the views were.  There is a walkway all way around and you can see all the bubbling springs all around you
6,Great place and free!,Did this on the golden circle It is nice - very busy - defiantly a must Good that it is free but I did feel as with all of these some information about it would be nice. Very limited supplies
7,Off the beaten track little gem,"My husband and I stopped at a couple places around the area because our flight arrived at 6 am and we couldn't check into our hotel yet.  The place is close to the airport (45 minutes).  We arrived while it was still dark out, but just hearing the sounds of the water was interesting. We ended up waiting until the sun started to come up so we could see more of the detail."
8,Reykjanes Peninsula,On our travels we came across this place and decided to check it out. I’m so glad we did only us a few other people. Really worth calling in to see the geo-thermal mud.
9,Guiser,"Our first day in Iceland was not a full day.  We landed around noon, ate lunch and then visited places around Reykjanes Peninsula. Gunnuhver Hot Springs was our second stop, following Bridge Between Continents.  It was cool to see! There is a ramp from where you can view everything. Make sure you have a waterproof jacket and be prepared for the smell!I definitely recommend spending some time visiting Reykjanes Peninsula and the unusual sights.  May not be as spectacular as the sights on the South, or photogenic, but they are unusual and worth seeing. In case you are interested, these are the sights we hit on our tour of the Reykjanes Peninsula: Bridge Between Continents, Gunnuhver Hot Springs, Reykjanes Lighthouse, Brimketill Lava Rock, Krísuvíkurberg, Krysuvik geothermal area (Seltún, Kleifarvatn and Grænavatn)."
