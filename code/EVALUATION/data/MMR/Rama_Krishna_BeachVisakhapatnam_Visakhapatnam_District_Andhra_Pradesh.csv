110,Excellent beach,"I was on a trip to Bangalore and had a halt at Vizag. Decided to visit RK beach which i heard a lot about. It was just 30 mins from Airport. Nice place. well kept.

We reached there in noon so it was not crowded. Couldn't get the see the Submarine Museum as it opens at 2 PM; We left before that; There was am option to lie down at Sunbatch chair (cushioned); they charge Rs 30 for an hour. No liquor is permitted there. But you can sneak it in from a nearby shop and drink silently, i heard..Overall the view was great! Wind was blowing nicely and it was cool. Great Experience."
111,Main natural tourist place for vizag,"Ramakrishna beach is within the city limits , once can spend time walking around during the evening. while most of the beach was clean there were bottles and plastic strewen around, lets keep our beach clean. VUDA can you also put some benches around so that people can sit watching the sea"
112,Beach with lot of attractive views,The Ramàkrishna beach at Vishakapatnam unlike beaches at Goa is a rocky beach. It is good for morning walks and gives a good view of sunrise. One needs to be careful due to presence of rocks.
113,Long One,This beach is close to the city and offers a good view in the evening. It also offers some entertainment in the evenings and some fast food joints.
114,Most crowded beach in Vishakapatnam ,The R.K.Beach is the most popular beach among the lot. The issue is though that the beach road that goes by the RK Beach has only a a handfull of hotels.Most of the buildings are residential complexes. So the charm and beauty of having a beach view room is a bit difficult coz of the lack of options.The beach itself is very clean. The road by the beach has very wide and well maintained footpaths for people to walk and jog.The roads are closed for vehicle till 76.30am as people walk and jog. Even I took part during my stay. Quite a few restaurants are available and swiggy and zomato is available in plenty in the nearby hotels.
115,Neat and Clean Beach,"this is one of the best beaches and a must visit destination at vizag. the beautiful location, scenic beauty and ocean are awesome and is an ideal place for a cool evening with family or freinds. must see"
116,Pathetic and dirty,Very populated in the evening when local people and tourists alike cone to enjoy by the sea. This naturally creates a lot of plastic and other waste. The sweeper ladies are continually working to keep the beach and promenade clean. Fast food and snacks stalls are there on the beach as well as on the opposite roadside. The beach is NOT suitable for bathing due to hidden rocks underneath. There are bathroom and toilets available on the beach. One must spend a great evening here. Bus is available from beach road to most location of the city.
117,Beautiful scenic beach,"If you went to Visakhapatnam, you should go to to RK Beach evening. Rk beach is very romantic at evening time. Sounds waves and breeze awesome."
118,Beautiful Beach,The beach is good fr spending time with family. But its bit crowded and dirty due to near of the city.
119,A relaxing place with sun bed at hourly rates,"Most happening place of the city.Clean Beach, clean water with white Sand.Well developed and maintained beach.Many attractions and places worth to visit are located here.Very good place to spend fun filled time with your family."
120,MIND FRESHAR VISIT,"This is a nice and long beach and very close to Vuda Park, Submarine Museum, TUV Museum, Visakha Museum, etc. Almost like a Marine Drive of Visakhapatnam. Lots of snacks and ice cream counters along the beach road."
121,Nice beach,Very near to the city & crowded. The wide stretches of the coastline and the main beach...Ramkrishna Beach is a wonderful place for the tourists.People can spend lot of time just looking at the horizon and the ships anchored at a distance anchorage.
122,Clean beach,Very nice beach for walking around and bathing with waves.We enjoy in morning and evening both the time.Also enjoyed Visakha festival by end December on the beach. So many food stalls and other items shop was there. This beach is near to the railway station and bus station.
123,RK BEACH,"During my family vacation at Visakhapatnam last week,we all went to to R.K.Beach in a evening. Location is good. The beach is crowded in the evening. Although it's an lovely beach,but not so clean.You can find lovely sculptures nearby Marine road.Also u can find some beach activities there.Great restaurants nearby. We enjoyed there for an hour .Also went for an walk.It was really nice. Then we had some coffee and snax at Coffee Wave which is just in front of the beach.We enjoyed an lovely evening there. If you are at Visakhapatnam ,then make a visit there"
124,Well Maintained Beach...,"R K beach is a neat and clean nice beach with great views atof sunset and sunrise..near to the city, and one can enjoy strolling at the beach.."
125,Vizag's most entertaining place,"This beach is not very well maintained.Most of the beach area are fenced so, expected more but not satisfied.However, Children's Park is good and few good restaurants are located on or near beach area."
126,Beautiful stretch of beach,"Scenic views of Bay of Bengal, this is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the city of Vizag. Must try - Muri mixture!!"
127,Nice place to be between 5:30-7:30 AM,"that was a rainy day when we visited this beach, but one must experience rain in Ramakrishna beach to have a wonderful view of the tides. its a commercial and beautiful beach too.we can have an abroad feel going through the beach road in nights."
128,CLEANEST BEACH I EVER SAW IN INDIA,"Very near to city centre. Beach is OK. Food and shopping centres nearby. Major attractions like Submarine museum, aircraft museum, marine museum are here only. Fishing harbour  (speed boating as well) and Mata Merry Shrine (Rose Hills) are nearby."
129,Wonderful in night,Rama Krishna Beach is the most crowded beach in Vishakapatnam.  You can see the open sea and enjoy the waves.
130,Ramakrishna beach ,"Nice beach, beside main road. There is some different small parks for kid's playing. Just awesome for roar of sea at night , Tea, coffee available . Only some risk for bath in this beach because there are many boulders."
131,RK beach,"Happening place of vizag as usual.Very nicely kept.Since we are travelling in hot season,evening is very pleasant.Happy family time"
132,The beach to house the only Submarine Museum in Asia.,I went to Rama Krishna Beach. The scenic beauty of the Rama krishna Beach is beyond compare. The Ramakrishna Beach occupies large part of the sea front and is one of the exclusive regions that is often the visitor's choice. It is great place to go.
133,An evening at RK beach,good place to spend time with family and feiends very calm cool and cpmposed place cool beach must visit for all
134,ya weather so cool in summer so i think nice place to chilling in summer,This beach its name from the Ramakrishna Mission ashrama across the Beach Road from the park. There is a Kali Temple and Shiva Temple on the opposite side of the beach. The beach is at the heart of the city and usually remains crowded. There are plenty of food options and is a nice for evening chit chatting. The Kali Temple opens at 4:30 PM so plan your timings accordingly
135,Nice beach,Ram Krishna Beach is about 7-8 Km from Yatri Nivas Haritha Hotel and about 4.5 km from Vizag railway station. Go there by auto via the Beach Road. Auto on Reserve generally takes 100 INR to 150 INR. Swimming is prohibited as well as smoking. Though I saw people swimming merrily. Horse and Camel riding available generally at the evening. Beach umbrellas with relaxing beds/chairs available at one point. Washroom available nearby on the beach itself. Ambience is good.
136,good place,"RK beach as it is known in short, is a one time visit if you are in Vizag and you want to spend the day. The beach is nothing different but the stretch along the beach is quite pretty. There are some exhibitions opposite the beach sometimes where you can shop too."
137,Very nice Beach,"RK beach appeared to me very beautiful. While walking along the beach, I found my interesting places like submarine museum, aeroplane museum, parks, etc. Lot of parking area has also been provided so that people can park easily and enjoy the scenic beauty of beach. I got chance to land in Vizag from sea side. The view was very beautiful and beach appeared to me full of life from above itself."
138,The beach is the 1st preference for visitors,"Any visit to Vizag was incomplete without a trip to the main beach of the city – the Ramakrishna (RK) beach. The RK beach adjoins the Beach Road and hosts popular hotels like the The Park and Novotel – it also has the famous Submarine museum INS Kursura.  Alongside the beach road, there are numerous hotels, restaurants and attractions including an aero plane museum.After a visit to the submarine museum, at around 5 pm, we headed for the beach. Footpaths were neat and clear and air was rather free from pollution. However, to our dismay, we found the beach to be quite dirty. Apparently, a major festival had ended just a few days back between Christmas and new year – and I was told that it was a major festival at Vizag. Post the event, it seemed as if the beach was left dirty.The banks of the beach were not well maintained without any landscaping. There were spots in the beach that were markedly dirty with pools of filth. And if this was not enough, there were beach scooters ferrying passengers for a joy ride – leaving the sand even filthier.The current of the water was very strong with rocky waves and I barely entered the water. Nonetheless, my family ventured into the water holding some bamboo poles that were seen at some places.There were street food vendors selling various stuff on the foot path and on the beach. My family feasted on the stuff much to my chagrin.Overall, we found it to be a very ordinary beach – dirty and unkempt – much in contrast to the relatively clean city of Vizag. I request the administration to take note and provide tourist delight through better maintenance. It would be better to have a lazy walk on on the footpath on beach road and do some window shopping or some late night dinner at one of the restaurants."
139,A beach with its Peace!!,i feel very relax when i visit this beach. its my favorite place in the world also.here you can get every this to shop.
140,Excellent beach view.,"Too dirty Beach, don't bath here, no guards,  no warnings, child park is best for families, Frontside too much good restaurants, novatel building is versatile to see, many food vendors on beach, economical food, must try porns,  bhel and other items.  Too much plastic bags on beach, so i dont like it, relaxing chairs @ 30₹ per hour, very nice."
141,Relaxing and wonderful waves,Its nice sand to walk on on this RK beach. We watched sunset and sky full of colors ! Its clean and fenced. So not litter found (against on many beaches). Small statues and memorials as well as museums nearby to enjoy.
142,Clean beach with lots of activities,"This is excellent for walk and view. Very nice footpath for pedestrian. Morning 5-7, entire road is closed to traffic which is excellent for walker and jogger."
143,Nice and clean,Rama Krishna beach is mind blowing beach the sea is looking like most beautiful place in the world with mesmerising location
144,A crowded and unclean beach located adjacent to Marine Drive type road with few other nearbtourist places worth visiting,i suggest if any tourist visit to Vizag stay at dolphin hotel and have relax in hotel and enjoy with great tasty food with different varieties veg and Non veg. Dolphin hotel is a family hotel were u feel very comfortable with the smiley staff.
145,Crowded & dirty beach,One of the finest beach in vizagWas crowded when we visited on SundayThe beach is really beautifulThere are places to sit and enjoy the atmosphere of the beach and feel the cool breeze.
146,MAIN BEACH,RK beach is one of the busiest and lovely place  to spent an evening. It was so beautiful  to watch the ocean and submarrine close to the  seashore . One  will find no of small vendors selling variety of foods there.
147,Peaceful mornings,Beautiful beach right in the middle of the city. The beach is right in front of the city skyline. Evening and morning wall over there is a thrilling experience.
148,real feel temperature very high,"Rama Krishna Beach is one of the best beaches in Visakhapatnam.It has a range of tourist attractions, and thousands of people take advantage of this beach on daily basis."
149,Perfect weekend spot,Rk beach is well maintained by the AP government. The only catch is that it can be cleaned up a bit. Ample parking space and nice benches to sit and enjoy the waves. Best time to visit is early morning or after 6 pm.
150,Nice Beach,"Ramkrishna beach is by far the best tourist destination in visakhapatnam. The best of hotels, restaurants and sightseeings are located in and around ramkrishna beach. You can also spend your idle evenings by the beachside."
151,danger and best,"Okay. Terrific crowded during peak season. You can't bath there, only to enjoy. Children and young guys can enjoy two/three types of ride there. You can spend idle time there also specially in the evening. Fast food is available here and there. There are so many restaurants also."
152,Lovely n lively Beach,the beach front is well maintained and cleaned very night by the staff of Local Municipality. Superb. not very crowded and scenic worth a visit
153,Personal,Nice place to spend time in VizagWe could not be lucky at that time since it was very humid and hot
154,Very Crowded,Breathtaking view and beautiful. It is right in the middle of the city so pretty crowded most of the most
155,Very Good and Maintained Beach,"It's a beautiful place to visit you have good amount of place to sit and chat, Street food, small restaurants, bus facility, parking facility (paid and non paid), 5 star hotels, submarine museum and recently aeroplane museum going to establish etc.The only drawback is that the cleanliness part at some areas you can find sand colour changed to black that's because of drainage or burning waste.Still then you can avoid such place and be at nicely developed area for sitting and chatting."
156,Crowded and shore is not clean.,"this is good view, we can see beautiful sunrise early in the morning. the beach road is fun in the morning for Joggers and walkers."
157,Enjoy the beach view ,Went there few days back! It is a calm beach which is totally neat and tidy with a little tourists visiting it. The beach is within 15 minutes reach from Railway station (take bus no.211 ticket Rs.10/-) and be there. Remember the first compartment of bus in the front is reserved for ladies and men are strictly advised to board the bus from back door.Good place to take morning /evening stroll as the views are amazing that time.
158,Clean Beach with good View,"I m born n brought up in Mumbai. Saw many beaches from berth here but first time I ever seen such clean n neat Beach.Very very safe for all, well connected to main city n market by buses n autos also private cabs n vehicles.Must visit !"
159,Beach very well conveniently located,"Recently we have again visited RK Beach. Weekly atlease 2 to 3 times we are reaching beach at night times with family. Night time beach is so pleasant and  environment is calm.Beach side foods like pani puri, Pav bhaji, palli etc...... are good to enjoy this sea environment.When you want a enjoyble atmosphere without any cost it is better to visit Ramakrishna Beach."
160,Dangerous ,"RK Beach is a must visit in Vizag and frankly you cannot miss it. while the beach is little dirty, the promenade is well maintained. very good for evening walks. enjoyed it."
161,Beach visit,Awesome beach however tides are pretty fast so be ensure not to go too much deep... This beach is really awesome and has a lot to offer.. anyone would enjoy on this beach and a word of advice for the families with kids .. Please do not leave your kids alone on this beach as tides are a bit high and fast.. Otherwise there is everything what one expect !
162,Jewel of Visakhapatnam,Been to RK beach early morning. Neatly maintained roads. Ample parking space and small park for kids.. Beach is good for early morning stroll.
163,"Neat beach, lovely morning sunrise and good evening walks","In India most beaches are public places for relaxation, walking and eating. The RK beach is the cleanest city beach I have come across. The walkways and access have been well organized and kept clean. This is one of the few places where you don't find trash piled up or littered with paper and plastic. There is a cool breeze coming from the sea and lots of length between the road and the beach earmarked for walking. Overall a nice place to relax in the evening or night. Several eating places are also available around here."
164,Excellent Beach ,Good for evening walk and taste some local crispy snacks. Not worthy for bath and chilling like other beach.
165,Regular Visiting Place in Vizag,We stayed at Gateway Hotel on the RK Beach and we were on the beach for all of 4 days. The beach is very popular and most frequented one as it is in the heart of the city. The Road adjoining the Beach is very well maintained and houses museums and parks.  As usual the beach attracts lot of people including many tourists. Several street food hackers occupy the walking foot paths and render the whole place dirty. The beach is dirty in the morning littered with corn stubs and offerings and other food trash. Also at few places the strom water drains carry sewage water to the sea and this causes the dirtiness and stench. Perhaps the city corporation needs to look into this.
166,R.K. Beach,"It’s a beautiful beach .. Nice blue waters clean beach and all you would want to spend time just lounging around. Must see place. Good view of the south hills popularly known as Dolphin nose.. Early morning visit is awesome, you can see the sunrise also. Ramakrishna Beach is the most entertaining plase in vizag for elders and children. For morning walk as well as for evening. Near by the beach many Exhibitions will happen round the year. Submarine and War craft exhibition, visakha museum are surrounded by the beach. Good Parks are also available for children at the beach road."
167,How can you miss RK Beach while in Vizag.,"I visited Rama Krishna Beach during my stay in Visakhapatnam in April 2018 with my family. The beach was located very close to my place of stay, which made it possible for me to visit the beach every evening/night for walks.The beach is very well maintained and is kept clean. The beach has a considerable visitors during the weekends. Otherwise, the beach is generally empty during the weekdays."
168,A nice beach,"Long rocky beach with great view.  A bit crowded as it located in the middle of the city. Not a great option for sun bath, but may be good for some walk.  Not that tidy though."
169,"Rama Krishna Beach, the best part of Visakha.","I see that all the tourists visiting Vizag, set out some time for this place, definitely. This beach has some other major attractions also on its path. They are like: the Museum, Submarine, now the new Tupolov plane museum, war memorial, etc many, besides the beach."
170,Rusty playing items.,Best beach which I love to visit from childhood always full of crowds and entertainment...Every time I am at vizag its a must go place
171,Repeat visit,"Nice clean beach , crowded during season but decent crowd , not to many places or restaurants to eat at the beach just a few push carts selling food but the opposite side of the road has good food places ,"
172,Not very clean beach but good for childern,"The Rama Krishna Beach is like any other beach and nothing special or spectacular to talk about.  But to spend an evening, and if you have free time its the place where you can take a stroll."
173,Nice beach,Everything seems good few years back here but now due to increased water pollution beach road smells very bad. Air is polluted with salt content and you can feel it in your skin if hangout for more than one hour on beach road.
174,Very disappointed with the upkeep of the beach,Beautiful beach. Nice place for family friends and kids too. Walking along the beach is nice or even a car ride. Good place to spend time.
175,Nice,Best time to visit this beach is morning time else it would be too crowded at other time. Sunrise in the morning time was awsome.
176,Pleasant visit,Visited Vizag after over 20 years. Was there mainly to watch the India vs SA cricket test match. Was very happy with the way the RK Beach area has been developed. It is fairly clean and the Submarine and TU142 aircraft museums add to the beauty of the area. Hope they keep it that way.
177,Good view ,Not much to do other than spending time in beach ! Better go after sunset as water is more on high tide and can spend some time ! I like Rushikonda beach more than this !
178,Beach with a Open Gym & View,"Clean,plenty of exercise mechines,lovely sands.good view.Good for walkingLots of local visitors Language is a problem"
179,Nice beach facing Bay of Bengal but unclean & untidy,"Thank's to the etiquettes of the people of Visakhapatnam, this famous beach ( both with the locals and tourists) is clean and well maintained. You can have a bath in the sea during the day or have a lazy stroll , enjoying the sea breeze in the evening.There are a lot of small shops selling street food to toys and clothes. Do try some street food while you are here."
180,Clean Beach Front of 30 Kms,"Located near Novotel And Gateway hotels, it is one of the best beaches in Vizag. Proper Parking. Plenty of People and Food Stalls. Very Clean and Maintained Beach."
181,Fun Beach in Vizag,"Vizag... the name vibrates me from my childhood... after grown up, luckily i get a job in vizag... I visit RK beach once in a day... morning walk,,Baathakaani on evenings... these are memorable"
182,Good Place to spend an evening,Good city beach with a lot of hustle bustle. Eateries available. However sea is a bit violent. Not recommended for swimming.
183,Avoidable,i went to this beach in the morning. very less crowd.i felt so peaceful and enjoyed the beauty of the waves in the morning.
184,Evening Solace,"At a first glance the ramkrishna beach and its sidewalk resembles the famous marine drive in Mumbai. I have heard that they call this place marine drive as well. The beach is well maintained with multiple parks, children's play area etc along the beach. We sat there till late in the night without any trouble and enjoyed the wonderful sea breeze. Lots of food vendors pass by selling fast food which you can enjoy as well."
185,The most popular beach in Vizag,Extremely clean and was beautiful that such beaches still exist. The pavements were clean and its close to the Submarine Museum and the Maritime Museum
186,"Dirty, bad and cluttered","Just overlooked by novotel Vizag, it is the most historical beach of vizag. Always a bustling place with crowd in all seasons.cleanliness still needs to improve but Vmrda has bettered it by cementing and also providing plenty of parking space just adjacent to it. But swimmer's beware.. It is very deep and and dangerous due to underwater rocks and sudden tides..to wet your feet, ride on camel and horses... It's perfect"
187,So nice,"Nice blue waters clean beach and all you would want to spend time just lounging around. Must see place. Early morning visit is preferable, you can see the sunrise also."
188,Dirty RK Beach in contrast to a Clean Vizag City,"The beach is alive during morning and evening.In the morning the road across the beach is closed to traffic.People use it for walking,jogging and cycling etc.Aircraft &submarine museum are located at this place.During evening hrs the place is lively with food stalls,its fun to relax on the beach."
189,A Beach to visit and enjoy.,Evergreen spot in the city for a quality time to spend with your loved ones. Lots of other tourist spots nearby.
190,Must visit ,A very quite and calm beach as less crowd would be seen here.Nice to be here to spend a peaceful time for your own.
191,I love RK Beach,"The beach is very good,calm and freindly. The roads are wide and well maintained.The beach is full of entertainent,food vendors and have INS Kursura submarine.A good place for evening pleasure."
192,Scenic Beauty,I never forget every moment i spent in rk beach every morning i used to go bech for walk u can see nice sunrise lovly place
193,RK Beach,So neat and clean Beach is hardly found anywhere. Sea's pristine beauty kept me enthralled. Ships are seen from this Beach. It's really amazing.
194,Nice Beach,"RAMA KRISHNA BEACH, named after the famous Ramakrishna Mission Ma Kali Temple and its ashrama overlooking the vibrant bay of bengal, the the finest jewel  Visakhapatnam tourism. It is the most happening place in Vizag and the mornings and evenings find a parallel sea of tourists, health lovrs and others by its coastline. The beach is exquisitely decorated  by the GVMC ( Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation and VUDA( Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority) . Entire coastline is beautifully decorated by various parks, attractive and graceful statues  of  mermaids, cute babies,  various animals like dragon, elephant, gorilla, fish , dino etc. etc. Statues of various scholars are also placed by the side of the beach road.Another major attractions are the  INS Kursura Submarine Museum, which preserves  a real Indian Navy submarine for public display . Newly Opened Aircraft Museum TU-142  placed opposite to INS Kurusura Submarine Museum is the latest attraction of the beach.Some of the best hotels of Vizag like Novotel Visakhapatnam Varun Beach .. are located here."
195,A Good Beach,I had visited this place for my friends wedding... Peaceful place. .. morning breeze...tides touching to your feet...
196,Visit to RK Beach,Very nice and clean beach i have seen their submarine in the sea lots of time up and down flying choppers and much much more very delightful horse riding and enjoy the concert.
197,The great Ramakrishna beach.,Did not enjoyed that much because it's so crowded all the time. It can be more planned. Cleanliness also another issue here.
198,THE HEART OF VIZAG TOURISM,"vishakapatnam is my favourite and most peaceful place.i just love vizag and its calmness. watching movies at inox varun beach and an evening walk at the beach is most happiest thing to do. winter is the best time to visit as it is too humid and warm during other seasons. araku,paderu and other tribal hamlets are pleasure to travel and see the life that you have never seen. everyone should visit these places if you want to experience real nature."
199,"Nice, blue water and clean beach","In the morning the entire stretch of road is used for morning walks, exercise and child activities with proper arrangements by the Vizag traffic. The beach is well maintained, neat and clean. Morning sunrise is lovely and the evening walks are pleasant with moon shining. Lots of food stalls are available as per taste."
200,Wow Beach !!,"Average....the location in some place is third class quality. Wastage from public toilets are flushing directly into the sea, when public are enjoying watching the sea"
201,Rama Krishna Beach is well maintained,I visited this place so many times. But every time I have new experience. The Government of AP developed very well after hudhud cyclone. My kids enjoyed a lot.
202,Lot of construction activities going on and political rallies added to the woes..,"There are better beaches than this to visit in Visakhapatnam - Yarada and Rushikonda. Unless one has issues travelling to those beaches, you can give this beach a miss..."
203,Vishakha utsav,"The beach runs along a well maintained road with a lot of shops and places worth seeing (museums, aquarium, parks, etc). There are numerous hotels to stay. Very accessible from station (2-3 km) with public transport."
204,Easily Accessible Beach,"The RK beach coast line is a beautiful stretch for approx 35 to 40 Kms. We can certainly enjoy a morning jog, cycling, walking with families and the weather is really lovely and we live here so i can only i absolutely love it. Being travelled all arouond the world and across the planet due to my business and job reasons i love relaxing here for approx 4 months a year with my family and having loads of fun."
205,Beautiful place to hang out in vizag,"I was in Vizag for a night for business and stayed in a hotel bang opposite to the hotel. R.K. Beach is nearly 2km long beach, little rocky, not meant for swimming, but suitable for walks and exercise. Morning breeze, sight of Sun rising and hundreds of people of all ages, sizes and shapes walking / jogging all along, makes a pleasing sight and motivates you. Along the beach there is wide pavement for pedestrians and also a few play grounds and open gym to stretch your self. It was a pleasure being there to breathe fresh air before starting your day for official activities."
206,Cleanest beaches,The RK beach in Visakhapatnam is the best I have visited so far to spend valuable time and enjoy the surroundings. The beach has enough parking space for cars and two wheelers and besides relaxing near the beach one can spend time in visiting the submarine museum and the  museum housed in re assembled fighter aircraft. There are umpteen choices for a family to enjoy in the beach area besides a number of restaurants to take care of your hunger. Ramakrishna Beach is a must visit when you are in Visakhapatnam
207,nice beach front,"RK beach has a beautiful beach front, but the beach is dirty. People do not care, and litter everywhere."
208,Beach Requiring Cleaning!,Clean and awesome. Time well spent. A must visit for beach lovers. Best beach in AP. Will love to visit again.
209,Sea beach,"This is a nice beach and get a little crowded by evening. The waves are high and sea edges are very rough. Hence, it's dangerous to attempt swimming or getting deep in the water here. Maintenance us kind of ok.  You have several vendors selling food items around the beach."
210,best place to visit in visakhapatnam for the people who lwiek mobs,Went for a evening walk in the beach. It was clean and beautiful. A must visit place in Vizag. There is a submarine museum which is also good.
211,not a swimming beach,Very crowded beach. Nothing much to do except sitting in the track and relaxing. One can have the muri masala by the beach side. The kali temple is a nice place to visit
212,Swatch Bharath beach,"Went on 2/10/17 with family, street food presence, nice pavement to walk. Good bustle on the road and beach. best keep your shoes sandles at bay and take walk on the sand. clean beach with good for playing beach vollyball, specially designed sand/ beach motorcycle."
213,Can spend a life time here,"This is one of the cleanest beach I have ever been to in India. Though, during the evenings it is a bit too much crowded. Try to go before the sunset, otherwise it is flooded with local people as it is a popular spot"
214,Clean & Good,"Nice beach with lots of space to roam, sit, eat and enjoy the view of sea..Its well maintained and has Ramakrishna mission, Kali temple in the vicinity.."
215,Nice beach,"Main and important Tourist Attraction of VisakhapatnamPeople from Orissa, Chattisgarh ,West Bengal and from many Neighbouring states flock in to see this Beach Horse rides  sea shells souvenir selling shops with petty hawkers selling eatables one one side High end coffee shops and eateries on the other side make evenings visit worthwhileMornings from 6am to 7 am Vehicles are not allowed  for the safety of morning walkers Ragi malt ,Hot hot Miller breakfast and small  farmers selling fresh vegetable is the morning scenery Submarine Museum,Air plane Museum visit completes the RK beach visit"
216,Visit,good beach whith in the city but crowdy. will be good if we visit the same in afternoon. evening u can enjoy street food
217,RKBeach,We got excellent opportunity to stroll on the beach and have some street food. The beach was farely clean but could have been cleaner. Breaze at the beach was exciting.
218,Clean beach to relax,"Dear sir,This is the place  for spending time with friends /family  enjoy sea  breez/tide splashes .eating snaxs of differant veraity  tasty chats ,maze etc  some time you will have nearby  exibissions also see some diferant types of articals at one place .bus service from RTC bus complex  is comfortable .Thanks  N Regards,G S PATIL"
219,Nice,Nice place to hangout in evening.. But it gets really overcrowded during the weekend.. Great eateries nearby for a nice dinner.
220,One of the biggest attractions of the city,"This beach is nice for the view and walk along the beach road. Swimming here is not the best thing to do. The long beach has got many other attractions, recreational activities, palm trees, and other spots of interest.A memorable experience overall. I would suggest a  walk along this beach in the late afternoon to have the best experience."
221,One of the Best Beach of India,Not well maintained beach anymoreToo crowded and stinky not to be visited with family as alot of garbage is thrown all around. Even the drainage water is mixed into the beach which is sick
222,Best tourist destination in vizag ,It's really nice place to visit either with family or friends. The view in the evening is very pleasant and is enjoyable.Thank you.
223,Amazing beach !!,We stayed right in front of the R.K Beach and the promenade was amazing. The place is chirpy from 6 am. in the morning to 11 p.m. at night.
224,Crowded always ,"I did not find in any different than any other beach. But that myt be coz i am not a sea person. If u are visiting the museums, this beach is just next door"
225,Heart of the city,It's a nice place to visit... I went there on my bike and enjoyed evening ride... I eat local food there and it was very tasty... enjoyed a lot..
226,Average,"Not only this beach is too crowded, it’s also dirty. The city administration must do something about the effluents that they discharge from the city right onto the beach. I would recommend going to Rushikonda instead."
227,RK Beach,"RK beach - excellent views, with the Submarine museum onshore. Have a plenty of excellent hotel by the shores. Nice place to stay few days and rejuvenate."
228,RK beach is a good place to spend time in the city,"Morethan the beach itself its the Sea front , its promenade and the walkway that attracts more tourists, walkers, joggers to this beach. Cycles are  also available for hire on mobile app."
229,Happening place,very danger beach it had sudden slops. best beach and well maintained. high flooting. we will lost our time hear
230,R.K.Beach,i love that i will give 5star review because its awesome olace for weekend chilling.......nd i enjoy that in so many times in rk beach...........its awesome
231,one of the best city beaches in india,"If you visit this beach in the morning, that too on Saturday or Sunday..you are in for fun. You can see large swam of people, walking, talking, exercising, eatting, playing, etc..."
232,A nice place of cool off in the evenings,it is a nice clean beach .It is not very broad but you can have a long walk on it.The beach is suddenly deep so one should take care.Drive along beach gives it a glimpse of marine drive with sandy beach. Morning when traffic is not allowed best time to have walk.
233,An evening walk,"The Cleanest Beach according to me, though one cannot take a dip in the sea, as it is very rocky.  THe Beach Road is very clean, rather cleanest."
234,Beauty of the ocean ,"This is a wide, sandy beach about a couple of kilometres or so from the centre of Town. There are outcrops of rocks at parts of the shoreline and it is popular with visitors and locals alike.  It is impressively clean given the number of day trippers who venture there.We visited on 16 December 2018, the day before Cyclone Pethai was due to make landfall and found TV crews aready waiting and reporting on its progress.  The Cyclone arrived on 17th December as expected but left very little damage at this part of the coast."
235,Well maintained beach ,"After roaming for the whole day we wanted to relax by the beach.We saw this sun beds on rent. At an hourly rate of Rs. 30We occupied 2 sun beds with umbrella and a piping hot cup of sweet corn.The breeze calmed our souls while the view locked in my eyes and heart.Its a busy beach yet beautiful.Please maintain cleanliness, Vizag is super clean and the people like to keep it clean.Help them and don't litter around.I have a full video based on my experience, YouTube - Khushi NotOnlyMakeup"
236,Wonderful time in R K Beach,Whenever we see that the sea is cool..we go there stand there..watch the view and discuss about the same..we spend quality time watching the sea.It makes us very peaceful.Very happy.
237,Indeed the best beach in vizag ,Avoid RK Beach if you are looking for a peachful beach outing. It is extremely crowded and dirty. Nothing much to offer expect small shops.
238,City beach,Its 6km from vishkapatanam rtc complex and 8km from vishkapatanam railway station.its big beach shore.
239,Good beach for walking and for small snacks - Go in the morning,swimming and bathing strictly prohibitedgood view and walk on beachsidea no of restaurants and street food options are also available
240,nice,"Coming from the good beaches in goa and a recent trip to Cebu, the beach was a disaster.. Though the government has kept it clean, there are a lot of hassling from beggars and vendors.."
241,best place in andhra pradesh,AP state has taken  a lot of effort to improve the place. But they cannot help if people lack civic sense and dump trash there. The road side attractions need some better architechture. Over all an average place to spend some time if you don't have anything better.
242,Nice place for beach visitors,We visited during the time of May and the beach is super crowded and really really dirty. I don't recommend anybody to venture into the water. Its a good place for a morning walk and pretty much that's it. Try RishiKonda beach instead
243,It was a good experience,Nothing spectacular about the beach itself. It is overcrowded but with good sea breeze. The submarine is worth looking at
244,My visit to RK Beach,Stroll down the beach will be a nice experience. But not that clean. Good part is that traffic is blocked in the morning time along the beach road. Lovely sight to watch the sun rise.
245,Stroll,Came back again in 2018 and spend multiple evenings in and around the beach - lots of attractions around the Beach Road.
246,Awesome experience ,"The beach is pretty clean with occasional litter being visible. During the evenings, it is prone to small little crabs coming on to the beach. Pretty harmless creatures though. A lot of restaurants and eateries are available just across the road. The street lights are interestingly sculpted with shapes of fishes, animals etc."
247,Crowded beach,A clean and well laid out promenade where tourists as well as health-conscious people throng. Early mornings are pedestrian-only to enable walkers
248,too big beach at Vizag,Beach is maintained quite well but was expecting it to be more cleaner. Took a long walk in the evening and observed that the cops were taking rounds and patrolling on their bikes for the safety of people which was impressive.
249,Nice beach,When u reach this place it seems like a foreign location.. The beach is great. Ample parking..and roads close to beach are wide n well maintained.. Hotels on the beach and many small eateries... This place is must visit.. One of the most well maintained beaches that i have seen..
250,TEENAGE HANGOUT SPOT,Enjoy enjoy enjoy your holiday trip in this beach this is a beautiful place to relax and enjoy your holiday with your family and friends
251,Enjoyble place in vizag,Hi friends I really enjoyed this place very much it safety tips simply good I really enjoyed more and more with my friends thanks lovely
252,Enjoyable,"We went in the month of June 2017 with my family. It was hot. The beach is very long and you can have all sort of fun. You can enjoy the sea water with the crowd or select you empty space. Opposite the beach if you cross the road you can find lot of good fast food. Most important the beach is clean. In short you can spend a whole day in and around the RK Beach, If you travel by car you can realise how long the beach is and also the view is nice. I will definitely visit again.Bye."
253,a beautiful place to see while at visakhapatnam,"Had been there with my 4 year kid and was a bit suprised to see that the playing items like childrens slide, sea saw ect are not well maintained and a bit rusty as well. It would be good if there is a bit more of greenary. As it is located just beside mainroad, thare is a chance of pollution which is not good for kids. Overall, good time .for kinds for 30 to 45 mins."
254,RK beach,"We were excited to see the Rama Krishna beach after a gap of 15 years but were truly disappointed to see how badly it is maintained by both the residents and the local authorities.  It is sad to see such a magnificent beach being destroyed by people who throw litter where ever they feel like all along the beach. What is even more shocking is the open defecation that the men folk indulge in. It is so sad to see this happen even after our Central and State Govts plead for 'Swach Bharat"" almost every day :-( -:(.  The only solace was that we could enjoy the morning walk along the footpath of the Rama Krishna Beach but we were just heartbroken to see the beach in such a sad condition. We did manage to walk on the beach alongside the magnificent waves but I don't think we will be motivated to visit this beach again unless it is properly maintained!Cheers"
255,Awesome Sea Beach but you can't take bath,It's a great place to walk but needs some structured planning to organize eateries in a professional and hygiene friendly way.We saw some shops selling food on the beach but they're food and personal hygiene standards were disastrous. Andhra is one of the best in IT and educational growth never thought hygiene will be so bad.
256,Clean beach!,The beach is good for morning or evening walking as the cool breeze passing by soothes oneself..!! We witnessed the live  boxing as well...
257,Good Place to spend your morning and Evening.,"The R K Beach has been on the top of the list of visitors for many years, It is going to remain so. It has many other attractions like Submarine, Aircraft, cultural, Heritage, Navy Museums, 2 children's parks, nice straight road, 5 star hotels like Taj, Grand Bay, Park, Novotel, etc for pleasant stay."
258,The beach stretch along with the statues on the beach make it a lovely experience,"Rama krishna beach was well ma8ntained and clean when compared to my last visit about 6yrs ago , huge crowd gathered , the hawkers sounds and local road side food was delicious . Not for swimm8ng , water looks highly polluted .so we dint plan to get into water Enjoyed a lot . Would recommend"
259,My recent visit here,Well maintained beach. Reasonably priced shops to purchase souvenirs. Secure place for family outing. The good thing about the place was that we could always find muncipal workers keeping the place clean. There are a few really nice restaurants opp to the beach and also an aquarium. Please do visit the place.Not a bad idea to travel by a sharing Auto to enjoy the view of the beach as you go by😁
260,My lifetime favourites ,"Good Place to go but no place to go in the sea .Its very bad if u want to enjoy going in sea. place is good for watching sea beauty , there is nothing good to eat with standard."
261,my favourite place in vizag,"Ganesh,a room boy is very helpful. The entire is courteous and cordial. Don’t miss the Spa. Ask for Namousong. She is the BEST. Pranav at the reception desk is very helpful and took care of all our requests with patience.Food was awesome. Beach access is worth mentioning. Would definitely stay here for my next trip."
262,R.K.Beach aka Rama Krishna beach,"NOt a great beach to go to. Being in the city limits, it is pretty dirty and crowded. Lots of stalls around dirtying the place. Be careful, its a really rocky place and you might hurt yourself. Also the place has lot of broken glass pieces. Beware. Additionally there is a great problem of parking around. CAN be max a one time visit. Try out the beaches on the rishikonda -bimli road."
263,Nice place to gaze at sea and watch people.,"A great place for a pleasant stroll along the beach front, snack stalls and other attractions are plentiful"
264,Amazing beach,One of the very few beaches in the country which are alive all the time. A very clean and safe beach at all times. The statues and sculptures across the beach stretch are really out of the world and a treat for the eyes. The Ramkrishna Mission temple across the beach stretch is very beautiful
265,Nice place to pass your time,"An Evening Visit astounds us beyond words, a beach showcasing beauty, calmness, serenity & everything that signifies nature at its best.There are too many people come to hang out in the evening."
266,Epic,It is not a safe beach for swimming. I strongly urge and advise all to remember this. Our East coast of India becomes abruptly deep and so it is dangerous. It is a wonderful beach for walking and listening to the ocean. The traffic police does a wonderful job of closing the road morning up to 7:00 AM for those interested in walking. That is great. I also saw a lot of vendors with healthy drinks and so on. All very good. But when I compare with similar beaches abroad I am saddened to see lack of hygiene. It needs a lot more work to clean and beautify it.
267,Lovely wide-Long-Clean Beach,"Good! I would recommend this, however would suggest to keep it clean. Cos lot of them are irresponsible and leave the food leftovers on the beach, which is disappointing. The beach road is a good place to walk. Please visit for a clam evening. I suggest a drive on the beach road."
268,Pleasant,One of the best beaches I had ever seen along with the only Submarine Museum of India (as well as Asia) which is INS Kursura.Had a very nice time walking barefoot on the sand. For the first time in my life went inside a submarine. It was an awesome submarine maintained by the Indian Navy. Got a very good Exposure being an engineering student. Got to know a lot about the working of a submarine. There was als a very good aircraft museum of the Indian navy.A must visit beach if you are on a tour to Andhra Pradesh .
269,Regular Beach,"A walk early in the morning along RK beach is an absolute one to start a day with. The fresh and breeze is an experience to feel and cannot be put in words. Good to boost energy. Whenever, I visit vizag, I try my best not to aviod the morning walk at RK beach. During the day time, one can visit Vishalakshinagar, which is on a small hill. There is park, ropeway, a big Lord Shiva statue and one can have a beautiful view of whole Vishakapatam from this place. And again in the evening one can go to RK beach and join the crowd there. There are quite good number of small eating places, mostly junk food, which can be tried. Can spend time easily till 9 to 10 pm in the evening with the family. While staying n vizag one can try tge sea food there which is available in many places."
270,Well maintained public beach,Good place to visit anytime...beach becomes too crowded in the evenings...it was great to be with so many people Around us...Beach was too huge...there were many lifeguard and many alerts from them...Good to visit with friends and also family with kids
271,Beautiful Coastline,"Seriously, I don't understand why the tours and travels for people coming from Vizag have this as part of their package. Beaches in Vizag are far better. THis is very dirty and you can see sullage mixing in sea from nearby neighbourhoods."
272,Big beach ,Good points: 1. Sunset2. Closer to city3. Direct view from Novotel4. Food joints Bad points:1. Extremely crowded2. Women have to be careful because some cheap men may stare you a lot or even follow you.
273,Nice clean beach,"Decent and safe beach even nights, though not very clean.Will be great if the maintenance is improved"
274,A peacfull place if u r going in morning,Overall it was a nice place to be with family and enjoy the beauty of nature.The ocean is quite soothing to watch.
275,Best beach in andhra,The beach is extremely dirty with plastic and bags from the various shops thrown about. I wish you could just avoid the sight.
276,Good sunrise view,I really likes the weather there.It's very cool and I love to be surf there.Apart from this went to visit port and dolphin nose mountains.Wish to come again here.
277,One nice place to be,"Nice place to hangout, you will find the tides are very high in the afternoon n evening time. Don't try to swim or else it will make u swim like swan. Overall nice place for hangout with friends"
278,Not a great beach,No words how much i miss rk beach cuz it was damn memorable over thereAnd i totallly loved vizag the roads are so neat Even beach is also neat without plastics etc etc Our room was near to rk beach so we played twice in a day😂Worth going thereYou get all the things over there beautiful place tooo
279,Beautiful scenic beach,"This beach stands right in the heart of the bustling city. With tiny shops, hotels, and restaurants all around. So expectedly, this beach is particularly crowded. With day-trip and excursion groups visiting in large buses, loads of cars, bikes and all that. This slightly reduces the natural charm, if you are looking for some peace and solace. For family and friend time, this could be a good place. With loads of fun activities and eating options all around. I was on a solo business trip and needed to clear my head after a long (and hectic) day. Tenneti park (and beach) is way better, though its far from the main city."
280,Good place to hangout with friends but atmosphere smells bad,"Limited options to eat, but restaurants on opposite road available. The beach has plenty of seating all along the coast."
281,RK Beach - the best place to stay at Vizag,"I had so much expectations from this beach. One of the three beaches that we visited on a day. Given that it is within the city limits, I now understand why it is not the cleanest beach out there."
282,Crowded beach but not so clean,"Maybe a little harsh but coming from Australia the beaches are hard to beat. This Eastern coast beach is sandy, but lots of rocks, some just hidden from view under the water mean that swimming is prohibited. Nice to walk along the beach in the evening."
283,very beautiful place in our city,We visited the beach on New Year’s eve and the beach was bustling with exhibitions and cultural shows. There was a huge rush all around but there is no chaos or confusion. Local people come there to relax and enjoy.
284,Nice View of Sea,"Certainly this beach was packed as we came during the time of a full moon so the people were, I'm quite unsure but it was a religious time for them. Very clean but certainly warm."
285,Nice beach,You can head over to the beach to find yourself amazed by the beauty of the sea and the bright sand. The nightlife is amazing on this road.
286,Most popular beach of Vizag,"One can sit and gaze at the sea for hours on end, there are plenty of shops all along for snacks, etc. And this place is full of activity in the evenings."
287,The main beach of Vizag,I've been here at least more than 5K times that itself speaks volumes about this place. Lived here for a long time so it was my daily night hangout place in all moods. Do Not miss out to watch this place at night time.
288,Famous and Clean !!!,"We stayed in a hotel that was overlooking this beach (as well as the sea) so were looking at it mostly when in the room.  It appeared lovely from far but found it unclean when visited it. The promenade next to it was nice and had nice park, gym, etc."
289,Cleanest Beach I have been to in India,"Went to the beach during my stay in the city, and it was a good experience. The beach was good with outlets nearby only and the beach road adjacent to the beach was very clean."
290,Breath of Fresh Air,Take a long stroll..Enjoy the Breeze.So many food outlets on the other side to choose from.Neat and clean.Sit and chitchat n have loads of fun.
291,Extremely popular beach,We had a nice time at the beach. Though the maintenance of the beach was not stellar. The atmosphere was very good.
292,Evening Spot!,We had fun in the water and it was super playing in the sea water. We also went boating and it was fun which was followed by heavy rains. Overall it was a good time spent with family.
293,Nice clean beach.,at 5.45 p.m. in May n first fifteen days of june though temperature shows 33 degrees C real feel temperatures will be 45 degrees n more.  its deceptive weather.  better avoid
294,Awesome,Wonderful place to be in the evenings. Long straight miles to walk or just on the benches and look at the sea.
295,good beach especially for morning walks,The beach is not a very long patch but quite long enough for a walk.  The road alongside the beach is broad with wide pavements.  Great place for the morning run and the evening walk.  Plenty of people at both times of the day.  Clean and many eateries along the beach front.
296,Decent beach,"This is a jogger's paradise between 5:30-7:30 AM since no vehicular traffic is allowed on the beach road. There are public gyms, Raggi Malt, Blood Tests, Coffee and tender coconut along the beach road for you while you jog/cycle. You may take shared cycles as well here. Early morning walk along the sea shore is truly enchanting."
297,Clean beach amid to city ,A clean and breath-taking road and beach with a considerable number of sight seeing places. A rich and memorable experience. Dont forget the Submarine museum.
298,"Good for morning walk, kids friendly",We have visited the beach twice early in the morning for a run. It was an amazing experience. There will be no traffic on this area till 7 in the morning. And then in the evening for playing in the beach. The waves are also shallow and enjoyable.
299,R K beach Poor cleaning,"The afternoon sun spread over the golden sands washed by the relentless waves rising from the blue waters of the misty sea. The azure empyrean above met the waters on the horizon. Caresses of the playful wind sang peace and happiness. And time stopped for me. It was the beautiful R.K. Beach, Vizag.But garbage littered here and there marred the beauty of the beach. More when shall we learn to keep the beauty unblemished?"
