0,Not quite worth the trek,Amazing views of Alanya once you get there but there really isn’t much ‘castle’ to see at the very top. At least in terms of the inner courtyard ruins which you need to pay 30 lira to enter. The best bits are the battlements on the way up.Make sure you get the cable car or shuttle bus up to the top. It’s a much longer journey than it looks from the town and is quite torturous in the Turkish sun.
1,Great!,"The fortress makes Alanya special. While not much to see inside it is still most impressive and the views are stunning. There are new walkways around the inside making it wheelchair friendly. You can bus or taxi to the citadel gate, but the best way up has to be the new cable car from the Kleopatra Beach side. From the cable car station you can walk through the lower fortress and what remains of the old town to the fortress - new walkways are being installed making it easy to get around, but there are quite a few steps.Tip - go early or late when it’s cooler and you have the place to yourself."
2,Nice views and lot of history,"The fortress makes Alanya special. While not much to see inside it is still most impressive and the views are stunning. There are new walkways around the inside making it wheelchair friendly. You can bus or taxi to the citadel gate, but the best way up has to be the new cable car from the Kleopatra Beach side. From the cable car station you can walk through the lower fortress and what remains of the old town - definitely not a wheelchair friendly approach though.Tip - go early or late when it’s cooler and you have the place to yourself."
3,nice view,"The castle can be seen from anywhere in Alanya, so this place is a must to visit when staying in Alanya. Be warned that it's really warm here on a hot summer-day. Be sure to see the small museums there too. The view over the city is absolutely fantastic."
4,A good few hours,The view from the castle is amazing but it is not very exciting as there are very little information abput the castle and not much has been done to make itbexciting to visit
5,A view from on high,"Brilliant view of Alanya, the castle itself is small, there are plenty of places for photos and views are excellent."
6,Alanya Kalesi,When visiting Alanya a trip up to the top of the castle is a must as the views are great - now they have a cable car that takes you up for 18 lira (about £3:50) return.
7,Historical,"I spend a few hours visiting the the Alanya Castle and i like the site and the view of the city from the top. I also recommend to take an one hour bout trip around the peninsula and have a look of it from the sea. If you like history, a few hours spend at the castle will be a nice break in a hot summer day. Try do to it at the sunset!"
8,Sunset,A nice trip is to walk up to the castle and look at the fantastic view over Alanya. It needs some training and if you are no a sportsman it is better to take bus or taxi up and walk down to Alanya centrum. A lot of nice places to dine and a breakfast on the top is a wonderfull experience
9,Worth it for the views,The castle itself is worth going to as you’ve got to the top but the most spectacular thing about the whole experience is the views ! Worth doing at about 5.30pm so you can watch the sunset on the way down.
10,Amazing views,"I like the history in this area and from this place you can see well over the Alanya. Good place if you want to enjoy from sunset or even do some sport (jogging, walking)."
11,A very nice historical place to visit if you want to explore Alanya,"You can walk around the surrounding castle compound for free but the actual castle you have to pay a little extra to visit. There isn't much information once you are in but it is worth paying for the views, which are exceptional."
12,Only for photography ,“Best view in Alanya”A must see when visiting Alanya. This is a beautiful old ruin with much history.This place is recommended to all people who like to do climbing. The route on foot can be done quite well.
13,Beautiful and Peaceful with amazing views,"it is a must see place if you are at Alanya area , part of the history that you can see and it is so nice at night to have a walk up stairs to the old city to see tha harbor lights from upove ."
14,VIEWS GREAT - CASTLE NOT - SORRY !!,"It's a beautiful historical castle with a nice view of the alanya coast , plus it's a good long walk to visit it and browse the surrondings , and maybe take a break at one of the nearby cafes."
15,Really beautiful ,it was a nice experience going up in the cable car there are a lot of steps to climb when you get to the top but worth it take water with you
16,View,"If you visit Alanya, don’t lise the chance to see the amazing view over the city , the old castel and the old mosque. You can take a taxi or use Alanya Teleferik which is self an experience."
17,Awesome,"The fort is something you can see from any part of Alanya. It's very magical at night. You have three options. One is to get to the fortress by cable car, which my husband and I chose, per person costs 33tl return ticket, I wholeheartedly recommend it. When you climb the cable car, the whole of Cleopatra's beach is in the palm of your hand, the view is enchanting and you quickly climb up. When you get out of the gondola you came to that ""first"" part of the fortress which is not paid and which is not decorated, but to me it was very nice and there are a lot of parts for photography with a beautiful view.Another option is to go to the other entrance, from the direction of the port and to come by bus dolmus (which because of Kovid 19 went only 2x a day) or taxi (be sure to bargain and do not give up, the taxi driver first asked us 50tl which is a little more than 6e to finally land at 25tl which is about 3e). So you come in front of the main gate where the entrance fee is 30tl per person, because that part is decorated and has lookouts from which the view is unforgettable. The main gate can be reached from the other side of the fortress and vice versa, in that part that is not paid you can enter near the main gate. The third way is on foot and I do not recommend it at all, especially do not try if it is not early in the morning or late in the evening because during the day the heat is unbearable and the sun is too strong. We did not know about the changed line of dolmus, so on the advice of some friends we decided to go down on foot and repented. It took us 1 hour to get down and the sun was strong and that was exactly what exhausted us, especially considering that it was a strong slope and I was in slippery sandals. Those who have more adventurous spirit than us, freely, along the way there are restaurants with fine terraces overlooking where you can dine and cool off. Inside the fortress there are a couple of restaurants and stalls where you can buy water or drinks, ice cream."
18,Take the Cable Car to enjoy stunning views,"We took the Cable car to the top which in it’s self was a fun ride with a great view! It’s a lot of stairs and walking once your’re on the top and if you have bad legs, travelling with small children (infants etc) be prepared to carry them. And if your’re in a wheelchair, don’t be dissapointed if you can’t reach everything - it’s not accessible in an easy way. Overall a nice place to visit with great view over Alanya and of the two beaches."
19,To see,What a beautiful place to visit especially at night time when the castle is all lit upThere is a small train ride (like a tour) that sits at the bottom and takes you up the hill towards the castle Simply stunning
20,You can’t miss this trip!,"I think that Castle visit is which you must be see if you are visiting at Alanya. Many restaurants offer free visit to Kale, if you will eat dinner after visit. For example Zorro restaurant. Kale is very old and famous place and you can see the harbour, beach from there."
21,5* for the views.,Catch the dolmus or lift up but a great walk down spectacular views.not much inside the castle walls but plenty to see on the way down. A visit to the boat caves is amazing but be warned rocky under foot and lots of steps.
22,Truly amazing landscape,Just an awesome sight to see and the views are spectacular. The history is fascinating and the castle is still in great shape considering it’s been there since the 1200s
23,Vibrant harbour area,"Though a bit difficult to get there, once you are in, it is the view, the breathtaking view of the Alanya Coast and outskirts, that takes control of your attention. Worth mention the refreshing wind coming from the sea... (Feb13)"
24,A peice of medieval history,"Alanya castle got an amazing location and best views in Alanya ,You can enjoy nice clicks and view the city of Alanya totally But there is not much to see or experience inside the castle area."
25,Nothing special,The short walk inside the walls of Alanya Castle was full of views along the coast in both directions plus a lot of historical references. There are a few remaining buildings including a small christian basilica and some ruined accomodation blocks. The main remains are the extensive Castle walls surrounding a the peninsular making it impregnable in ancient times. There is a vast rainwater collection system and water storeage facility inside. The follow up tour on the harbour outside was on a pirate type vessel and visited a few caves under the castle and demonstrated the impregnable nature of the castle cliffs
26,"Enjoyable place with a lotf of possibilities to visit and take photos, or to sit, eat and drink.",A lot of places to hike in the castle. Most of the places are historical and there are explanations you can read .There are still people living in the castle. There is an old but very impressive mosque in it. You must see the view of Kelopatra beach from the castle. I highly recommned you to go up with cable car . It takes 3-4 minutes to go up but worths seeing the view on your way and up in the castle.
27,Stunning views,"It’s a very long and steep climb if you choose to walk: but the views over the coastline below are worth the effort. You can of course drive, take a bus or a taxi. Walkers do not have to follow the road all of the way: there are shortcuts. Little remains of the castle than the outer defensive walls (of which there are a number across the wider landscape). The 13thC castle was built by Sultan Alaaddin Keykubad."
28,Alanya castle,"When in Alanya it is worth your while to visit the castle, as this is pretty much the only place which is genuinely Turkish in Alanya and the views of the surrounding landscape are breathtaking."
29,Worth seeing,The trip went to the top of the Castle which while having good views was only worth a short visit. Hence stopping to see how Gourds were used to make decorative lamps; though they were reasonably priced. The castle walls are largely intact and would have been quite a hike to get around. Then the usual boat trip for an hour to fill up part of the day when maybe an hour free time would have been good. Lunch in the hills was quite novel but cost 35 Tl if you wanted a swim (assuming there was time). The fare in the trip was the usual Trout or Chicken as provided on every trip!
30,Well worth a visit,It's a steep climb to the castle but u can get a taxi unfortunately in August although temps in 30's it feels like mid to high 40's plus unbearable humidity... Not to self never come in August againPersonally I much preferred Bodrum superior castle amphitheatre and mausoleum plus a more compact city easier to get around
31,Alanya Castle,We hiked up the hill to Alanya castle. It was a hot trip and it is best to do in the morning. Views were great all the way up. But the best views to the turquoise sea and the city were from the castle. You should come here if you visit Alanya.
32,Day trip from Side,They promise a castle to see but the only thing there is is just some ruins and no pictures or info about what there was without extra paying . So to get there it will cost taxi or bus plus entrance to an open place with just some walls and no explanation or many English signs. Their English its worse  then mine .😝
33,Nice ,"brilliant views  places to visit & see on way up or down,.lovely town centre food id restaurants very good & you can bargain with retailers"
34,Interesting fortress with breaktaking views,"The castle and its grounds are not very interesting on their own. Mainly, you'll see the castle walls and a few remnants of old structures. However, the view from the castle is beautiful. You can see Cleopatra Beach and the beautiful blues of the Mediterranean Sea from up high. It's still possible to see similar views without going into the castle; there are scenic lookout points outside of the admission area. If you're trying to save a little money, see the castle and the view, but from outside.We stayed in a hotel located right next to the castle and drove up by car (small fee for parking). I wouldn't recommend trying to walk up from the bottom due to the heat and humidity (plus it may be a hardship for anyone not in good physical shape)."
35,30/70... 70 not for it,"We visited the Alanya Castle with family, it wasn’t a bad place, lots of walking, excellent view of Alanya and the coast."
36,Beautiful view,Absolute must if visiting Alanya. Has some fantastic views from the castle. It cost us 15lira each to go in. We caught the local bus up to the castle cost 2.5lira each and walked back down stopping off for refreshments in the bar/restaurants who also have fantastic views over Alanya.
37,fascinating view,"It is a places in Alanya you should visit. The view and landscape is spectacular!We've been visiting around noon on a day in july, maybe not the best time because it was too hot.You don't find much shadow to hide from the sun and we ran out of water. By the way, buy water in the town before you go up there, because it is very expensive near the castle.If you are afraid of hights you might get dizzy when you look down."
38,Beautiful,"We took the cable car up to the castle which offers some beautiful views on the way.Now is the beware. The hike from the cable car to the castle is hard work especially if you go when its hot. It is not suitable for pushchairs or wheelchairs. If you have any lower limb injury I would recommend getting a bus from Alanya. The steps are quite high and the path is quite narrow in placesOnce there it becomes worth the walk. There are various places to eat and drink and small stalls to buy the local wares.The views are stunning and the places you can visit are informative, saw plenty of signs telling the history of the castle.There is a shuttle bus (free if you used the cable car) to take you to the citidel but it cost 25Tl to go in.All in all a lovely place but too many stairs."
39,Kale,"You cannot Come in Alanya and not visit the Castle.You have a fabulons panoramic view on Alanya. There is a Nice  Walk to do above, a beautiful mosque and a cimetery up There to see and visit (please wear a trouser or long skirt to be respectful of the place). You have typical anciens houses and a few shops.The place is full of history. I advise You to go in the evening to avoid the Heat and have a magnificient landscape with the sunset.Be careful with children because it's hard to Walk and You cannot really use strolley."
40,alanya castle,"Well boarded walkways now allow you to wander safely around the ruins form where there are amazing views of the coast, sea and mountains as well as over the city."
41,Nice views and good for walking.,It's the best place into the city center which you can ever visit. You can take taxi or bus to the top of mountain and meet there mysterious hystorical castle with the spectacular view of the full city. Also for climbing down there're very interesting roads which are rooting you to the port or other sides of city. But with children it's a little bit dangerous and tiring.
42,THIEVES. DO NOT BOOK.,"Nice day trip to Castle. Sit in the castle and enjoy some amazing views of Alanya. Cable cart from Cleopatra Beach (Nr Damlatas Cave). Or local Bus. If your up to it you can walk to the top. Follow road from Cleopatra Beach, steep stairs that follow cable cart route leading to rugged path takes you to cable cart station on top."
43,Great trip to the Castle,The trip up the mountain is fun and you see this little village all the way up with small shops. If you go there to watch the sunset you will not be disappointed...the view from the top is absolutely spectacular. Be there around 18.30 if you want to make sure to catch the sun go down :-)
44,Nice place,Very long walks all around the castle and surrounding area with outstanding views. many road side stall and shops where you can haggle for great deals.
45, Not worth it,The castlecis on the hill.an ancient and historical place.very nice view.you can see a perfect view from alanya and take memorial photos and videos.
46,Castle and museum,"Great experience at low cost. The castle itself isn't very exciting but the view is amazing. I recommend taking the bus up to the castle and a mellow walk down the mountain. Entrance fee is 15tl per person and the bus is 2,5tl."
47,Great place with great view,"We took a long winding path up to the castle with help from some of the locals. the view from the top is amazing and taking the cable car down and back up is well worth it. However we really enjoyed walking around the windy paths, going off track and seeing all the local bars and shops. It was very hot and tiring, but worth it"
48,"Very good prices, non pushy service.",I had been walking up to the gate of the Castle almost daily for a bit of exercise & was impressed with the size of the Castle. However once inside we were dissappointed. There isn't a great deal to see inside although the view from inside the castle grounds are impressive.
49,Worth to visit,"Beautiful views from here, well worth a trip if in Alanya. Sunset is stunning! If you get a taxi up the driver may well offer to give you a tour of the grounds, this is well worth it as they tell you the history and show you much more than entry only to the castle at the top including the 800year old mosque on the site plus they will take you back down the hill which is pretty steep and drop you where you prefer."
50,Amazing!,"get a taxi to top is the best way to get there, the views looking across Alanya is beautiful. The walk down is nice."
51,Trip to ancient times,"An incredible historical place, which one must visit! Starting from the Red Tower near the port of Alanya, visit the old shipyard and thereafter make sure to visit also the top of the castle!"
52,Nice view from the top,"I first visit the Castle in 2001. The view is stoning and the history about it is worth a visit. As a traveler in Alanya every year, I always visit this place and take beautiful pictures.The first year we walked up the mountain, but that was pretty hard. If you want to walk up, go early morning or take a taxi/bus up👍"
53,Very nice place,"Alanya castle have a really nice view! entry ticket is only 15 lira ,inside castle is a bit boring apart from a nice view is nothing there to see"
54,Surprisingly good,Very beautiful would recommend we love this beach it’s beautiful they have boat trips that are fantastic
55,Amazingly attractive place,A must see if you are in Alanya. The view from the Citadel is absolutely breathtaking. Also it's always good to see something more than just a beach. ;)
56,Super view,"the castle is nicely preserved and offers excellent views, also it is quite big, I would not recommend to walk to the top in midday heat. entrance fee is quite high to inside castle - and offers only magnificent view."
57,Panoramic view of Alanya ,The cable car just opened in August so it's easy to get to thw castle and it costs 18 lira for a round trip. The ticket fot going inside the castle is 15 lira. I recommend to enter the castle because you will discover the beautiful landscape from above Alanya
58,Loved it here.,"Nice view, but not for this price. They close castle before best views so there is no possibility to do pictures of amazing sundown."
59,Everyone must see the Alanya castle,A little expensive to enter the castle. The drinks in the local shops are also expensive but very cold and refreshing!. The guy selling the fridge magnets is very nice and good prices!!!The views from the castle are amazing and well worth the visit. i thought there would be more of the castle to view its actually quiet small the area you can walk round :(
60,5* for the views.,"A really beautiful old fortress, very much preserved, with absolutely stunning views of all sides of Alanya."
61,A lot of work but the views are worth it,"A must see when visiting Alanya. This is a beautiful old ruin with much history, and if that doesn't appeal to you, the view definitely does. Very spectacular and beautiful place. A must see when you go to Alanya."
62,Must see,The cable car from Kleopatra Beach is worth the trip alone but the views at the summit and the sympathetic way the restoration has been and is being carried out make it a worthwhile visit the walk down the other side (free bus if you retain cable car ticket at certain time So) is also quite spectacular.
63,Huge complex castle,"This place takes a while to get up to and they charge money to see whats inside which isnt anything spectacular. But surely a nice view and if you are sneaky you can find figs, pomegranate and other fruits to pick on the way."
64,Lovely place ,"Yeah so the views are nice when you get there but they're actually much better on the way up. We paid for a taxi to take us there as we heard it was the must see attraction. It definitely was not. The highlight of the ""castle"" was a cat and a couple of butterflies. Otherwise it's just some bricks and no information anywhere about anything vaguely relating to the castle. Don't waste your time and stop half way up for the views - visit the red tower instead for some history"
65,Stunning Views,Worth the trip for the stunning views as well as the castle it's self if walking take plenty water but there are taxis galore and trips aplenty boats included that take in the town also for those not wanting to roam by foot and it is beautiful lit up at night
66,Perfect for all,Amazing view from the castle you can see all alanya from here. Our Queen the ship is spotted from the castle and you can see the other side of mykonos if you to another view and you will watch an amazing sunset.
67,Dont bother ,"Alanya Castle is presented and managed so well. There is a raised walkway to all locations and is fully accessible by wheelchair. The views are fantastic, the carpark is properly managed and the little shops at the entrance were fair and well presented. Well worth a visit!!"
68,Amazing views,The views from the very top is great. You can see not only the coast but the town and the mountains as well
69,Worth the effort,"The views are the highlight of the visit to the castle. Overgrown, scaffolding stopping you getting into a lot of the places inside the castle. For the 24 TL entrance fee, they need to be putting the money back into the site. Not much info on what you are looking at. A man with a parrot, taking photos of you & the parrot, & charging you money.It is a shame this site isn't loved & looked after. A lot of people have said this is good to visit, but I think they are talking about the area surrounding the castle, where the shops, museum & mosque, coffee shops are. Yes this area is a nice place to visit, but inside the castle, not so nice, so I wouldn't visit again sorry !!"
70,Must visit Alanya history site,This castle is well worth a visit really interesting history.  The views from it are out of this world.
71,Perfect ,Had a great hour at the castle views were magnificent and so was the weather and only 15tl to get in bargain
72,Best views of Alanya.,"Fantastic views it worked about £5 to enter but that was for two castles, we used the cable car to get to the top which was all round £4, once you get to the top there are a lot of steps to get to the castle area but there is plenty of market stalls places for a drink church grounds a full day, we had a lovely meal right on the top of the castle stunning views, I would love to go back."
73,Alanya Castle,Lovely museum and views of Alanya from here.We took the cable car for ease.Lots of shops and restaurants there as well as the museum.Interesting place!
74,Amazing daytime activity,"We noticed the castle when we arrived on the beach as it is at the top of a large hill to the left once spotted we had to pay the castle a visit. There is a local dolmus bus that is around 5TL to get to the castle or a taxi oh the way us costs around 20TL. Once you arrive the views on the top if the hill where the castle is located are incredible! You can see all the cables defence walls as well as the beach in the right hand side, the caves down and the harbours and Marina to the left hand side. There are plenty of little restaurants and shops on the way up to the castle and outside of the castle itself which offer drinks, snacks and souvenirs. The castle is 15TL to get in but once you are inside the castle there are plenty of different little churches, mosques and purpose made platforms to view around the top of the walls so everyone can see the vicinities. There are often callings for the mosque which are incredible up there as you hear the echo around the area when you are up so high. There are plenty of information boards fitted around to given plenty of information and background information of the castle and it's History."
75,castle,"Cable car up to the top and a great place to explore. Only 18 kids to go on cable car, bargain! Not suitable for anyone who has problems walking."
76,Nice castle!,"We were taken by Ringos place to the castle. Our guide told us lots of information and best view points, 800 year old Mosque there also"
77,great view,"Wonderful place to visit, perfect view from the top to the city. Driving through the narrow roads adds some adrenaline."
78,amazing view,"Well worth a trip up to the castle, we took the cable car up which 14tl each once at the top there is a walk to the castle, you purchase a ticket from the booth at the top, there are a couple of tearooms and a mosque on the pathway up, once at the castle gate there is another tea bar and souvenir shop also some local stalls selling handmade goods.the Castle is expansive and well preserved, stunning views in all directions from the walls.wear decent walking shoes, take a hat and some water.we walked back down the other side with views of the red tower, there are many tearooms and restaurants on the way down, we stopped halfway down for a coffee admiring the views."
79,Great view 10/10,"stunning views of alanya. don't walk up! take a a taxi, bus or the new cable car to the castle (cable car accent is not suitable for wheelchair users as there is a climb after getting off) the castle is being made more wheelchair accessible inside"
80,Very good place,"Although we stayed a bit further out of Alanya, you have to spend time in the harbour area, both in the day and at night. All the boat trips leave from here, so prepare to be asked to go on trips. Lots of bars and restaurants. Great views of harbour, Red Tower and castle above Alanya town. Vibrant area with lots of activity. At night it is even better. Nearby shops for all your shopping needs. A must visit area."
81,Very nice view-point,"We reached the castle by taking the cable car from next to Kleopatra beach. Amazing to think how this place was built so long ago, the views over Alanya on a clear day are incredible and definitely worth making the effort."
82,"Panaromic cable car ride up the steep hillside, beautiful views of Alanya and the Med from a historic vantage point.",Place is average but the view is excellent. You will see the sea from the top of the castle which is amazing. Full city view and harbor view. Nice restaurant next to the castle to have a nice meal.
83,Very impressive,"a good city view from the top , nice if you're mobile and love history , not much else to do except taking photographs of the views , entrance fee was only 15 lira per person so not too expensive"
84,Good sightseeing,"If you visit Alanya, you can´t miss Alanya Castle, Kale. It is ancient place for pirates and view is amazing. You can see whole Alanya and take unforgottable photos. Better not walk there, walking in hot day will be hard. Take a taxi or cheaper way is go with Dolmus bus.On the way is an excellent reataurant, Panorama. Food is so good with great view to Alanya."
85,Must see,"due to its history and location, one should certainly go up and visit this place... impressive scenery on sea.."
86,Castle,"We toke the Cable car ride to what we thought was the Castle itself but we ended up having to walk tremendous amount of stairs up and down in the hot sunny Alanya day. so if you have a child, in elderly person or you just are not in shape I would not recommend it because the place is not really worth it. We bought tickets to go to the museum and I thought it was a genuine museum so we got a ticket which was like 20 or 10 per person after that we have to find a ride again to another location of the ride was free it was provided but keep your cable car tickets because you will need them for the free shuttle ride to the top of the castle. you’re not going to see much just the view from the top I’m just telling you to view itself and there isnt much information all in all it was not really worth it because it was very very sunny and hot and a lot of walking there is a mosque at the top which was to say the least plane and not worth saying with a lot of graves there is like a small house which they kept in good shape and it was OK but not that it’s not worth it just the view from the outside of the castle when you’re far away or in the boat trips. Other than that at not worth it"
87,Nice historic site,"Breathtaking, historical part of Alanya. A must go place. Fantastic view of the city and Mediterranean coast. Bottom of the castle, harbor area is worth to see to take pictures and have a meal as there are decent restaurants available. You can go up to the castle by foot, bus or cable car. There are souvenir shops and cafe bars where you can eat and drink. Easily a full day can be spent there without hesitation."
88,Awful,"A visit to the castle is a must, its quite high up so I would recommend you either use the cable car or get a taxi.  We took a taxi and the had our very own tour guide as the guy took us to the most amazing views, and explained to us about the history of the castle in English which was great.  He gave us the option of going inside, we did for about 15 TL and had a walk around as we thought we can't come all of this way and not go inside and the views overlooking the harbour and beaches were amazing so would really recommend it."
89,Very well Managed and Presented.,"This castle is wrapped around a very large hill by the sea, get to the top by the cable car is highly recommended although you can also get up by Dolmus, the ride in the cable car is by far the nicest option with stunning views of the bay and all for a very reasonable round trip 18tl or £3-£4  well worth it"
90,Fantastic views. The Kalesi itself is fairly average,"You can't miss the Castle from down below in Alanya, it's one of the reasons I chose to visit this town as there's always something to see. You can walk up the hill but it's quite a climb and in the heat it can be a bit of a trek, or take a taxi ride, or as I did get in the cable car from Alanya Gardens at 18TL. It's a short ride up to the top and a nice ride with some great views, all you can hear is the wind. Once you've arrived you can explore the grounds of the Castle, you get some breathtaking views of Alanya, once you get to the end you pay 15TL to enter the viewing area right on the edge of the cliff top. The best place to see the sunset and views to the west you see Kleopatra beach & views to the East. Definitely one place to wander around in Alanya and soak up the stunning views."
91,Nice view,"Alanya Castle is absolutely amazing. It s not just about its architecture but the amazing view which lies under and all around it. After a steeply walk/drive you finally get to see its beauty. It s not extremely big but once in top of the mountain just take some tine to enjoy the view. The entrance fee is 15TL and there are so e souvenir shops around. There are also cafes and restaurants near the castle with an gorgeous view. I totally recommend it for a visit while in Alanya or around.PS: Ladies,wear comfy shoes🙂"
92,Good place to visit,"The walk to Kale Hill Top is nice hike. Make sure that you have good shoes and water with you. There are numerous mini markets / restaurants and cafe's so it is rather easy to refill your water reserves. Must admit that this needs some earlier exercise and the 30+ centigrades with sun shine is not making it any easier, but worth it."
93,Beautiful view,Wow what a view... both going up and coming down and the castle it's self has the best views... be carful with small children it's very high and no barior as u look over.. loads of restaurants on route for food drinks
94,What a hidden pearl,"You could easily spend a good deal of time exploring the castle, if castles are your thing. There is a lot to take in and the site is vast - much of it still occupied. It's walkable to get up to it but you'd probably need to be a lot more dedicated than me - it's a long, steep way!  The No. 4 Dolmus (a few lira) is your answer, or a taxi (about 20-25 lira) or the new Cable Car (18 lira return)Spent a morning up there and just scratched the surface. There is a brilliant little cafe/bar down a path opposite but near the main entrance. Incredible view with just a makeshift fence between the tables and the drop!Very worth a visit."
95,Take the cable car for fabulous views,"It's location and history gave it the advantage of being the most important part in the city to see , it gives you the opportunity to see the hole city from different directions and angles . If you make a boat trip around it with a guide rider who explains all the caves and features around the castle you will understand exactly every thing about the importance of the castle ."
96,Part of Alanya Tour,We would just like to say we visited the castle in alanya it was a fantastic view and a good day weather was beautiful and good day to take loads of photos for memories we decided to go in the castle to see for our selfs we had to pay 15 lira each and was disappointed that we could only walk around the castle outside and was not allowed to go inside the castle As it was being renorvated but we was not informed of this when we're purchasing tickets to go inside the castle.
97,Great Views,Fantastic views of Alanya Bay at night time. Some market stalls en route if wanting to shop Castle closes at 8pm if wanting to visit.
98,Highlight of the holiday,"There were great views in the Castle, but compared to other attractions, the ticket was quite expensive."
99,definitely an interesting landmark of Alanya,"We took the cable car up and walked the rest which is step in places but worth it , to get into castle is 15 lira worth it just for the view"
100,just do it,Visited Alanya Castle on a trip and i have to say i was not disappointed with its stunning location and views this is a must visit when coming to Turkey and have the chance to go to Alanya
101,Alanya castle amazing wiew,Take the cable car from the prom. Thought it would be a castle visit but there is a whole village up there to wander. Few eateries and plenty of history. You could spend a day up there
102,Beautiful,"This is lots of fun, the trip takes about 4 hour, and takes you around the coast with some beautilful scenerier, the you get in the open sea, and the fun starts, with the pirates entertain, must try price tdl. 200,- inkl.. Lunch.Have fun enjoy"
103,Organised trip,A must go and see.Especially at sun setting.Breath taking views.Little old village at the top wear everything made by hand.
104,It's quite a view from up there! TIP: Take a taxi or a cable car.,"Walked and road to the castle, beautiful views and nice snacks to eat to replenish your energy, worth a visit and lovely to see lights at night."
105,Alanya Castle,You can walk around a medieval fortress for a long time and get nice pictures. You can also find marvellous views of the hill and feel like a real medieval pirate!
106,Alanya Castle,"Amazing bird view from castle to Alanya , everybody must visit  this place . Bus nr 4 takes you up to castle every 15 min. Cost just 1 EU."
107,Good,Breathtaking views worth a visit very steep hill up to castle so wouldn't recommend walking use the bus service no4 one euro each way so cheap as chips
108,Must see!!!,"This nice castle located on the top of the hill offers a stunning panoramic view of the city. However, the entrance fee for this castle is 15 TL and the castle itself isn't much of an attraction. The walk inside is no more than 10 minutes and doesnt offer anything worth buying a ticket for.Tip: you can still go all the way up to enjoy and take pictures of the view without paying the entrance fee. You can get there by walking the devlish way up or just get on bus 4 (closest stop is in the city centre opposite to the mosque, see picture) the tickets are 2,50 TL per person"
109,Walking on history,"bus takes you up to top. firstly went to view point and learned a bit of castles history, next to a local family house in castle grounds to see how the locals would have lived. saw a old loom and learned how the ladies used to make silk and given a demo. Oppertunity to buy silk scarves. Then given a bit of history on the oldest mosque within castle walls , and able to go inside {ladies given skirts and scarves to cover up and everyone removes shoes }.Stop made at small gift shop for freshly squeezed orange /pomegrannet juice and home crafts"
110,A Citadel with a Scenic Marine View,Very old history and high on the top of Alanya if you like to see all alanya from top you have to visit this place ones absolutely Fabulous
111,Nice castle dividing Alanya center.,We rented a moped to go up and my god the views are amazing. We did not  go inside the museum part but it's worth going to look at the view. Cafes and restaurants going up to top.
112,Amazing views,Must be if in Alanya. Mostly for people who like walking. Lots of shops up there.  Lots of ways to go down make you lost easily but for me this is huge plus cause could see more.
113,Lesson of strategy,"Some restaurants or travel agencies make even free trips here, or low cost. Try to go there also during sunset, it's absolutely AMAZING."
114,Stunning views,When you come Alanya you must visit Alanya castle. This place is brain of Alanya.you can see both of side kleopatra beach side and alanya city side. Evening time is very romantic wiew
115,History,Must see if in alanya one of many beautiful attractions in this great town for sure. Will be back again next year I'm sure
116,Well worth a visit,"Nice historical side of the Alayna town. Better to go up in a taxi, it is exhausting to walk there in the summer heat. Split the cab for 5 lira per person (20 total). Also an interesting graveyard up there."
117,Vast castle complex,"Views from the top are staggeringly beautiful, well worth a visit. Taxis and a regular bus service from kleopatra beach are cheap enough and a small charge is made to enter the castle area.Make sure you take plenty of water with you as the only place to buy drinks at the top charge a bomb. £5 for a 1/2 litre bottle of water. Just around the corner from the bus stop at the top is a nice little café selling drinks at a reasonable price."
118,Wonderfully memorable.,"not really interesting, some good photos and walks, 2 towers  big and small one, long walks and that is."
119,Stunning!!,"If you will travel to Alanya, don't forget o visit these castle with the Great view of the Alanya city and surroundings"
120,Wonderful place!,The walls are very nice. This place is so full of history. You can enjoy a drink there or buy sime souvenirs. And the view is perfect.
121,Fabulous castle,Well worth a visit. The old town and castle fantastic. So much history. Lots of restaurants close by.
122,Cable car to the Castle,For those trevellers. who enjoy historical places. The bonus is great view on sea shore and all Alanya
123,don't expect a lot from the castle itself,A challenging walk on road an Hills with a beatiful view of Alanya. Taxi to the castle is also possible and very cheap
124,Amazing Views,"Very nice place, boat capitan that took us on the tour said that was a stronghold of pirates in the past. Nice stories..."
125,History in Alanya,"Its a must if you are on holiday in Alanya, the best is to walk, up and down, so many things to se and so many different path to walk, you need god shoes, and water to drink, og in the morning or in the afternoon, can be to hot in the middel of the day, if you are not able to walk, you can take the bus or one of the yellow taxis...You can go from the harbour on the east side, or from Kleopatra, one way up at the other down. Its Nice to have finner on one of the restaurant, to watch the sunset, amazing"
126,A must visit,"You can take a taxi to the top and walk down. Later a cable car will actually be in service and both is recommendable, if you have trouble in the heat or is not looking for a good excersice. But actually you can find many different tracks walking up and down to the castle and you will find beautiful views everywhere. The castle area really is fantastic and surpricingly big. I recommend, that you walk either up or down the path through the Tophane district, were a lot of houses can only be accessed by foot, so steep is the track, and you will find the track to this district right behind the Red Tower."
127,Work in progree,"Worth to see once ,  there is telecabin to go up to castle , from there you can almost see the whole alanya ."
128,Top touristic attraction,Go with teleferik and walk to the harbour by the main road and stairs. Nice views and good walking stairs in the hill.
129,what a view !!,This is the original Alanya. The views from here are stunning and the road up is beautiful with cafes and wee stalls.
130,Stunning castle ,"This castle is one of the Ottoman Empire's greatest creations and we spent 2 days exploring and still did not walk it all. My son is a History fanatic and walked it till his feet and legs ached. Beautiful structure, views, English translations on the History and great walk. Whilst it was cheap for entry my only complaint would be the water/drinks etc triple the price at top so take plenty of water up with you and meander the stalls and restaurants on the way down the hill. The walk is worth it."
131,Authentic,"Long and quite steep walk from the pier where our shop stopped to the castle, on the top if the hill above Alanya. Nice walk, lovely day. The lovely location pays off , not very much inside, cheap entry ticket. The tour inside takes not a long time. It's a must see location in Alanya, you can go by taxi if you can't walk,  it deserves the visit."
132,Nice rock and castle!,"Whether just passing through or staying in Alanya, I strongly recommend taking the time to visit this castle. The sites are AMAZING and the new tram going up is aff or cable and gives a breath taking view of the beach and surroundings! You will not be disappointed. Also, there is a vendor just down the street from the monastery that sells various traditional Turkish items. She is very nice and has incredible woven tablecloths. Overall experience was superb and the people very friendly. You won't get a better view of Alanya and the bay anywhere else!!"
133,Alanya Turkey ,Just so much to see. The walls many of them accessible- with care! Are apparently over 6.5km long. Loads of unadvertised nooks and crannies Byzantine churches. Abandoned towers could spend months exploring
134,good visit - recommended.,"Visited the castle today and I think I preferred the view from afar.The gondola ride was probably my highlight, all else was a little overrated. The views were nice but would’ve been better without the smog... the castle walkways are pretty dangerous, please wear suitable shoes not sliders as these will not do when walking on metal scaffolding.Also note that the gondola ride up is about 50 TL (2 pax) but if you want to visit the castle right at the top then be prepared to fork out another 50 TL (2 pax).My free view of bodrum was a better one..."
135,Huge and fascinating...,A old castle with old rocks. Its hot up there and the history isnt very excited for me. A good view over the City and the Beach its the only thing to go up there.
136,Just great.,"You can imagine the history as you walk around. Traitors gate, the wells, lovers cave. The views are outstanding. A must visit. Use the new cable car or take a dolmus."
137,Long and Large areas,"The ruins are awesome and the views are breathtaking. This is a must see in Alanya. Accessible by foot and taxi. A small fee for entrance, and very nice cafes, small bistros."
138,Beautiful views,Grear views on way up. Walk around the tiers and castle fab. Bought fabulous nut lights hand made by a lovely gent near the castle. Excellent prices and all different.  Looked around the mosque as non Muslims it was lovely to see and hear the story of the mosque. All the store holders were friendly.  Lots of steps though and quite rocky at parts but we'll worth a visit.xx
139,Great views,If you are in Alanya you just must visit this. It's beautiful and you can't regret it. I have been up every time I went to Alanya it never gets bored. Love to go in evening times when the sun sets. do check if it's still open
140,Amazing beauty and history ,I nice break from the beach og pool is to take a trip to the castle.If you are in shape or would like to be in... take the walk or a bike.On the way up you will have great scenery and view of Alanya area.Nice to include your lunch at one of the restaurants up there.
141,Beautifull views,28 Lira return trip from near Kleopatra Beach takes you to a newly modernized castle grounds. I did not pay extra to enter the gated castle area but walked extensively on wooden boardwalks. Some great views of beaches and the Alanya harbor. One restaurant and some stores offer much needed refreshments. It wasn’t overly crowded in December. Definitely a highlight of Alanya.
142,Lovely place must see,"Very beutiful views from on top of castle, you can see all of Alanya.  Cost is about $6 per person (kids free) for castle, well worth the visit.  You can drive all the way up and park for $1"
143,views,"Bit of a walk up so best get transport or the new cable car. Stunning views, advise going up just before sunset then watching it from the top"
144,Great views,"Sitting atop the hill facing the beautiful seascape, Alanya Castle is truly a gem to visit and photograph."
145,lovely views,"View is great! Intresting place, nice to go there because of view... Dont go if its too hot during the day..."
146,Fantastic view,This is situated on the hillside above Alanya. It is accessible ny cable car or by walking though it is a very very steep climb. We chose to take a taxi to the top. These are very reasonably priced. You can also go by dolmus for a few lira. The castle itself is dated from around AD 1200 but the site has been occupied since 142 BC. The views are just amazing on all sides and it was a pleasure to just sit and soak in the atmosphere. We chose to walk down the winding roads from the castle to the harbour. There are so many interesting sites to see on the way down and lovely spots to stop for drinks or food as you wish. The road eventually leads to the Red Tower down a cobbled path. Amazing to think we were following in the footsteps of people from over 2000 years ago.
147,Worth a trip,"I visited Castle in last December. Weather was so good too. There are many restaurants and motels on the hill close by the Castle. It's so lovely to have some meals at the restaurants and watching the beauty of Alanya from there. My wonderful experiences was throwing the little stones to the sea from the Castle. It was never went down to the sea.Gravity! It's awesome! I tried 3, 4 times but it did not work, but there was in history, some of it touched the sea. May be once in blue moon. You should try it!"
148,Mr & mrs ,Not the castle itself but its location worths seeing. You can grab a beer or some tea up in the hill. The view from castle is pretty cool. Especially in spring weather it would be great to visit.
149,Beautiful view,Well worth a visit even if it is a long way up! You can get a taxi up and walk back down with bars a restaurants on the way!
150,Worth a visit,"Lovely marina, boats all around the coast line offering boat tours.. 1hour/5hour. We chose not to do one of those as we have done them many times before, instead we hired a private yacht for 5 hours which again, we booked around the marina. Lots of choice when it comes to bars/restaurants.. which are a little more pricey but its to be expected with the location. You can head a few steps away from the marina though and theres lots of cheaper places. There's a few nightclubs around there too."
151,nice location,We used the cable car to get to the castle but walked down. We were not charged to walk round the castle as most of it was closed for renovation. There is a mosque and cemetery there also.  I would visit again when full access is available. The walk down is by rocky paths so not advisable if you have mobility issues.
152,A bit of culture in alanya,"This is an attraction we tell all our guests to visit and they are never disappointed. There are beautiful shops with handmade goods, breathtaking views of Alanya and perfect olaces for refreshments"
153,Stolen heart,"the location of this castle is up in a hill, so we needed to go there by cable car. but i think it's also possible to drive there. it's very nice to see the whole city and beach from up there."
154,Very Disappointing,"Wow this place has some really amazing views. I would like to warn people with very young children though, that this castle is very very high up and in some places there are no barriers so keeping your eyes on your little ones is a must! It's very cheap entry and a lovely trip, you can see the whole of Alanya and the views are breathtaking. I would recommend going a bit later during the day as it gets very hot up there do if you are planning on going during the day take plenty of water"
155,not really interesting,"The locals told us to visit in the evening, that is was beautiful at sunset but also cooler. With temps hitting 40c every day you couldn't cope anyway.We paid 20 euros for a taxi to take us up the mountain to the castle, wait for us, stop on the way down for photos and then take us back to the hotel. Well worth it.You will be better of in trainers and the paths are obviously ancient and rocky.Lots of stunning views across the mountains and the beach. Lots of graves scattered around from the same family which was pretty.We walked around the outside falling the castle wall around the mountain. Take lots of water"
156,Gorgeous views of Cleopatra Beach and the Mediterranean Sea,"First time i visited in March. Its beautiful up there, I really recommend a visit. The view, the flowers, the ruin, the free turtles. Alanya Castle also has a really good Restaurant.My 2nd visit was on my 52 Birthday and thats when i visited the Restaurant."
157,Interesting and extensive,Really nice views from the top but quite a long way up to get there. I recommend taking a taxi at least in one direction
158,Ehmedek and the Alanya castle,"Work in going on to make the castle more accessible, in the meantime there are some very rough paths to negotiate within the castle grounds. There are some good information board around & the views from the castle are magnificent over both the bays. I recommend using the cable car to get up & down from the town."
159,'Lovely views',"Nice place with a lot of history behind. Very beautiful view. Yiu can see all Alanya suburbs. If you walk up there, take some water, as road is steep. I would recommend walking, nice scenery."
160,Incredible Castle,We visited the castle as part of an organised trip. The advantage being the coach takes you to the very top. Mostly walls but the views are superb. Archeology going on with in the ruins. Board walk walkways around the site with a disabled lift to take you up to the viewing level. No toilets at the top but the coach stopped on the way up and down wouldn’t know if access for the disabled
161,⛵ Boat trip,"I loved this place! Got a taxi up to the top from the town in the morning, it's a ruins at the very top of the out cropping. A Few Lire entry (Around £2 at the time) and your free to have wander around. The views are stunning from the top.A Small shop and coffee place near the entrance with a handy taxi-rank adjacent."
162,Perfect view,alanya castle is one of yhe most important historical buildings on the world.  You should see at your life
163,Nice view of Alanya,"A reasonably well preserved and large fortification on top of the hill dominating pretty much the whole beachfront of Alanya. Definitely a worthwhile experience to spare time for when you are in Alanya. Signs of several different civilizations and repairs and rebuilds over the centuries is very visible in the walls and buildings of this ancient port citadel. The walls are in a pretty good state but most of the old buildings inside are mostly ruins under renovation with an Ottoman Mosque and a good number of more recent buildings are still intact and accommodate a small number of locals who still live there in the citadel. While there is a road all the way to the top of the hill into the citadel and the castle together with frequent bus and minbus services to take you to the site from the port/Marina side, a more recently constructed cable car takes you up to the citadel quite fast from the Cleopatra Beach and Damlataş Cave side of the hill. Being so close together, while visiting the citadel, it's probably not such a bad idea to reserve time for a visit to the picturesque Damlataş Cave as well. And finally a few small shops and restaurants atthe top but my recommendation is to suppress your hunger, you can have a very rich Turkish breakfast either on your way up in the morning or a nice lunch or dinner on your way down later at the Muhtar'ın Yeri (the village administrator's place). Don't forget to take plenty of water with you especially if you are going up quite early before the small shops in the castle open as the sun is pretty intense up there on the rough stone cobbled pathways."
164,We enjoyed it.,"We visited this castle in the morning, it's interesting to know the story behind the castle but to be honest there's not a lot to see. The views are amazing because the castle is situated on the top a mountain, you can take really nice pics."
165,great views,"We caught a taxi from the harbour to the Castle which was well worth it as our driver also acted as a guide.  The history and location of the castle, the mosque and red fort, the views from the top were something not to be missed."
166,Magnificent castle and view,"Lovely walk through the streets to the castle, but be aware of the boundaries as it is easy to overstep the right of way! And were politely invited to leave by a soldier or two!"
167,Nice views and cooling wind,"I loved the Alanya castle. The surroundings, the shops, the view from the top of the castle (!), the souvenirs shops- everything on point. I would not recommend paying 15 TL (if I remember correctly) to enter the castle, it is pointless: there are just some ruins, with one board explaining the history of the castle, and that's pretty much it. Not worth the money imo.You can spend that on a nice tea in one of the cafes with a stunning view.The castle is worth a visit though, you are literally walking on history."
168,a lovely day out ,"very nice view, expecially at night. Try night safari to see all beauty of the Alanya town and castle."
169,Greece & Turkey Cruising,"I have visited twice, both via a city jeep tour. Highly recommended for photographers. Lots of history. Very peaceful in the evening."
170,Just Good For Views,"We took the cable car 18tl return (£3) for the fabulous views over Kleopatra beach,  it was very busy even at 5p,m.. and dont expect to get a carriage to yourselve, they pack you in.It only takes about 5 mins to get to the top.. then there is a walk up to the castle but you can stop on the way up and admire the fabulous views over Alanya city and harbour.The castle area is huge and there are lots paths leading to ruins as this once was an inhabited area, there are still people living up there. The mosque is 800 years old and you can see it lit up at night.  Well worth a visit for the history and the views."
171,"The walk to the Kale Hill Top is one of our annual habbits, great walk","Go with cable car, it was awesome overlooking ocean from the top. Have many places to roam around, can easily spend 1-3 hours. Cable car is the best way to go up and down."
172,I've been coming here since a child,"It is much less preserved than castles in other countries. It's got less information, guidance around it. There are refurbishment works going on - hopefully it will be much more entertaining. However, missing it if you are in the area is not an option."
173,Excellent view,"The visit to the ruins, whilst interesting as the stroll back down the hill into Alanya. Quaint houses and chapels view with traders stalls and fantastic views."
174,Not very exciting,Castle was interesting  there is work being done at the moment but it will all add to making this more interesting to visitors
175,Super ,"On the way to the top of the hill, where this castle is located, we stopped by Red Tower to have a look of it. And there we made a decision to take a taxi to the top of the hill, as it was way too hot to walk in there, taxi cost 40TRL. There is also bus route to the hill.Serpentine road was nice for the views, and as we ascend, views only got better.Fee to castle was 15TRL. The area is not so big, so it don´t take too much time to walk around the castle, but it is really worth it to go to there, because castle in itself and there are couple of lookouts to the Alanya City and Cleopatra Beach.It depends of the weather, but we got some nice cooling wind from the sea, so it was quite nice experience to walk around the castle wall and look that nice landscape.Then it was time to go back to the City, and this time we chose bus (starts at daytime every half an hour) fee 3TRL/person.There is souvenir shop on the top of the hill, as well as an snack bar and toilets."
176,Beautiful place with great history ,Amazing  views.... Just  beautiful from  the  castle  🏰  you  can  see  all  beautiful  town  Alanya  🏙  🏔  🌅   😁  👌  👍..
177,Alayna tour in Jeep ,"Having an apartment just outside Alanya, we very often explore Alanya's surroundings and one of them is the Castle. A walk up and down the castle in a slow pace with a break will take you approx. 3 hours, but it's all worth it with the fantastic view, small restaurants where you can stop for a cold drik or a turkish tea. Make sure to take the small paths and NOT the road when you walk downwards again, that will take you though the local area of the castle, with some of the very old houses."
178,Big expectations!!,"The first thing I noticed was the hill Alanya sat on, it was huge. We found the road going up and started on our hike. PLEASE BE CAREFUL, this is where we encountered a man who said he new a short cut. This is not a short cut!!!!The views going up are amazing. You can see the whole of Alanya, new town and old. On the way up there are restaurants where you can stop for drinks etc. Nearer the top it leads you through the Citadel, here are people selling their wares. Once your at the top, it cost is 15tl each to get in. This is worth it for the views alone! I'd probably suggest using the bus to get to the top if you have children. However this only seemed to run hourly. We did it on a cool day and I looked pretty ruined by the time I was at the top...! The castle itself was having restoration work done on, so would love to return in a few years and see the difference."
179,Alanya castle,"It is one of the top touristic attractions of Alanya. Panoramic view up there, very enjoyable. It is long walk and if you are without car, you may consider avoiding hottest hours."
180,Great castle ,"We went by a taxi, because we could not easily found a bus. the top of the castle is not so distinctive, or even you may be disappointed. Its the scenes from the top toward the Mediterranean sea which compensate your taxi fees. also descending by foot will enable you to see nice nature."
181,Visit Alanya Kale,Great ruins dating back to 1200s. Breathtaking views of the sea from high above. Must be on the list when in Alanya.
182,Beautiful Castle,"Good place for sunset. Perfect panoramic view. A good, but difficult way for walking. A little town in the castle."
183,Holiday ,Nice castle in daytime and in the evenings. If you are fit- have a walk up to the castle. You can also go by cable car which is quite new.
184,Excellent views,"The main part of the castle which is part of an old fortified town is at the top of a steep winding road (3.5km / 2.25 miles) with no side rails on a peninsula. Expect to do most of the journey in second gear and try not to get stuck behind one of the town buses which is another way of getting there.Once you get to the top, the main castle area is actually fairly small and can be walked quickly but offers the chance of some spectacular views. This is an unusual attraction in that the remaining structures are spread around the top of the peninsula and is reached by following signs along paths or the main road you came up. The signs are not particularly good so how you get to the other parts of the will be partially due to luck but adds to the interest.On the way, up you will have passed through a gateway on a sharp hairpin with the remains of a small church nearby. Just below and behind the café is also a good start point to walk along a long stretch of the wall around the peninsula. Note that the wall is only about knee high to the walkway with a long drop the other side and is not part of the official attraction. The wall extends up to the lighthouse about 4 turns from the top carpark. At the lighthouse, there is a cobbled pathway at the top with bollards to stop errant drivers that becomes dirt track as you head towards the gateway that offers good views of the eastern side of the town.Note: If you went to the cave at the bottom, they will charge you again for a different car park. You can't use the same ticket. If you are coming by car and are planning to visit other historical attractions in the area, consider buying a museum card - it will pay for itself in 3-4 visits. Note you can only visit each one once."
185,Nice walk with great view all the time,You can catch a bus up to the castel from Kleopatra Beach there is a few market stalls just outside cant remember how much it cost to go in but it was not very much. WE walked back down it a very steep hill further than you think. people very helpfull in the castle
186,Very hot at the noon),Just visit the castle of alanya. Also horbour. And at the night all the open air discos withnice turkisch restaurants. And dont forged to do the boot trip of alanya.
187,Trip,Really beautiful place. Perfect for those hot days to go there and relax. The breakfast time is my favorite to go there and there is super much things to eat. The water is ice cold and after you dip in you feel like a new person :-D
188,Breathtaking ,If you are in Alanya you must come here.You will be delighted with a beautiful view.There are also nice restaurants and cafes .
189,Last mimunte decsion,"We’ve booked a few trips with Alex, he is always very friendly, the prices beat the reps by far and the service is great. Alex’s English is very good so the trips were explained well, we have 3 kids under 10 and they all loved the mud baths and the pirate trip. If we come to Side again we will definitely use Alex to book our trips."
190,Trip up to castle,The castle offers great views of the city and not much else. There are some ruins of the Suleyman Mosque that date back to the fifteenth century but that's pretty much it. It is no Tower of London. You could take a cable car to the Cleopatra Beach from there.
191,History personified,Great way to spend a couple of hours. the views of both sides of Alanya were fantastic. I would recommend this.
192,Beautiful City,we visited the castle with RED tower and also use the cable car with enjoying the Cleopatra beach which was really perfect.
193,Wonderful experience,"The castle is in the middle of restoration but is well worth a visit if you enjoy history, and there are stunning views of the city from the top. The entrance fee is about £4 and there are boards around telling you the history of the place. It's a steep climb to the top but you can get the number 4 bus up or a taxi."
194,Worth a visit,"I want to go here again, it was so magical. You must be good on your feet as there lots of walking to do and bring drinks as when it’s hot it can be unbearable.  I loved the cable car ride, the views are stunning and the cost is so reasonable. Once at the top, you will have to walk again to the Kale and museum (I didn’t get a chance to go to the museum, so next time).   There is also a cab service for 10 euro that will take you to the top of you don’t want to cable car it.  The views and history is amazing. You can visit the small mosque, but take your shoes off and they provide headscarves.  During the walk there is a restaurant and cafe so you can buy refreshments.  There are small shops and market stalls and there prices are so reasonable and cheaper than the town, you will not have to haggle. I loved this place as it was just so relaxing, and it was nice not to have to haggle.   They sell clothing, lamps, jewellery, bags, so there is a souvenir for everyone.   I really want to go back, as I want to explore the whole lot and take a whole day up there next time.   You must visit this place, it’s a must do if your in Alanya Central. If you like your history take a day out and really absorb the vibes."
195,Beautiful view,Very disappointed with this.Cable ride up was fun but beware of lots of steps to climb up. Bad pointsConsidering the number of tourısts who visit this be aware there is no information boards giving the history of the castle.There was no signs pointing you İn the right direction to waLk or what you was walking to.We never saw any personel once at the top of the long climb to ask about parts of the castle. Alot of money is made from tourısts and yet not a penny spent on information centre or locatıon sites of where you are inside the castle. View is good of Alanya if its not to busy in the view points.Do not go up there in the summer mi ths daytime far to Hot.
196,Mandatory if you are in Alanya,Good trip out for 4 hours convoy of jeeps. - lots of fun.  Three stops in total castle - fort and top of hills for sunset photo shoot. Value for money £16 each
197,Beautiful ,"Its best to get a bus or a taxi up to the castle, otherwise it would be a very very long walk. Its very nice to look round and the views are amazing."
198,Pirat ship,"I went up to this castle with my girl friend using the cable car. When we reached the top we got shocked at the view. You can see both the marina and the Kleopatra Beach. I can't even describe it. You just need to go there and see for yourself and then you wiill thank me for it ,). You can also buy beer at the castle from a street vendor."
199,Nice view,"View from castle is nice,but you will climb ca 1h for 15 min of visit.Better visit castle with citytour,than transport will be provided.If you will have nice healty walk than that is what you need.3 km walk in one way to 250m high place.And in this area is cheapest orange juice,that is selled by lockals.Smell of ceeders was great too.But in castle self nothing to do only photos.O suggest take with some food and do nice picnic:)"
200,day trip,Was lovely to go and walk round and see the castle but we didn't no what they was saying because the tour guide didn't speak English
201,15 tl for empty castle,Really beautiful place. Amazing view. Specialy sunrise and sunset. Lot of coffee places around. Nice place to walk nd take some pictures.
202,Chilled,"We could see the castle everyday from our hotel room and at night from the beach and it looked stunning. So we decided to make the trip to the castle. We took the bus there as that was the cheapest means of getting up there. However once we got there the entrance fee to the broken castle was too expensive so we decided not to go in and explored around the place instead and discovered an old beautiful mosque. We then enjoyed the slow walk down the mountain, looking at the different fruit trees on the way and the way people live around that area. It was lovely. The view was very nice from there without paying a hefty price for the entrance to the castle."
203,A voyage to middle ages,"The area is well designed with a wooden path, leading to the ancient mosque, passing the castle area up to the castle itself.We went in winter and it was fresh and breezy. Highly recommended"
204,Teach you how to be patient,"Very good activity and plave to look in alanya.you can there by cable car, it will cost 18 liras round trip.when you reach there you will climb some stairs with some effort.the castle is a must see in alanya."
205,Really nice views from the top,One of the best place in Alanya so far i've experienced. I'm in love with history and that castle gives you all.
206,Local tour included trip around the castle peninsular .,"You can take the cable car or you can go there by car. At the top, you will find a well preserved historical castle with beatiful panoromic view of Alanya. The castle and the area around is really large. There are beatiful paths for walk and discover. Choose comfortable shoes and take some water. You will probably spend a few hours there."
207, Alanya tour,"We went here on an organised trip through Thomas Cook. The road up to the ""Castle"" is very thin and windy. We were going up to it about 9.30am so never met any busses coming down. When we got to the top at the castle. Our guide took us in and pointed out a couple of things then left us to roam. I now know he did this because there appeared to be nothing more he could say. Part of the castle was open and had a good view down to the surrounding area but that it where the Attraction stopped. Most areas were fenced off and falling to pieces, there was only walkways round half of this small site, there was little shade and absolutely nothing that could be listed as an attraction. There were no indoor sections or evidence that anyone had ever lived here. It really is only some poor quality walls on a hill. On the trip down the hill we met a couple of coaches which were coming up but our guide said ""We're  lucky"" because it can sometimes take an hour to get down the road instead of 10 mins. This is not an Attraction. Avoid!!"
208,Worths seeing,"The Alanya castle or Alanya kalesi was build around 1200. You have a nice view on the castle from the promenade in the harbour, which is 250 meters lower. Now it became a big open air museum."
209,Castle visit,This place is recommended to all people who like to do climbing. The route on foot can be done quite well. The route up and down are quite steep however and not well suited for the untrained person. An good alternative is to go up by car and and stop at the various places to enjoy the view.For those who enjoy geocaching there is enough opportunity here.
210,Day trip to Castle,"Beautiful trip and beautiful view, worth walking. Everything is so turkish and cultural, definitely go there and enjoy a great view"
211,Interesting historical castle with terrific views,"Nice wiev to Alanya city, harbour, mountains and to Kleopatra beach.Try to walk threre and back and you will get more of the Kastle visit. Also you should visit outside of the main entrance."
212,Nice castle...but only for the view,I love the history in this place. It has been well looked after.You can have a guide. Ours was very informative.The views are amazing.This is well worth a trip.
213,WORTH IT FOR THE VIEWS,"Visited Sep 2017The castle is situated on a peninsula in Alanya. It stands high above the town.There are a number of ways to reach the castle. I made the mistake of getting a taxi at the bottom of the road. If you are of a nervous disposition, keep your eyes closed. Our driver was quite reckless. On some parts of the road there are no walls or safety barriers.  Took about 10 mins to reach the summit. Cost 30 TL about £7.50 / 8 euros. Very expensive, I suppose this was the tourist rate. The second way is to use the cable car. This takes you about 2/3rds of the way up. You will have to walk the rest of the way to the summit. This is quite a steep walk in some areas. Cost for a return ticket is 18 TL. Cable car runs until 11pm. The third way is to walk. I would advise against this unless you are extremely fit. It is a steep climb and for the most part there are no footpaths. There is little shade and day time temps in the summer can reach as high as 40 degrees +.  You are looking at around 2hrs to get to the top, take plenty of water. There are a number of small cafes en route.At the castle. Entrance is 15 TL. There is not much of the castle left now. Very disappointing, not much to see except lots of tourists taking selfies from the ramparts However, the views over Cleopatra beach and the harbour area are quite stunning. Decided to walk down back into the main town. This was a bit of an adventure came across remnants of an old village and one two other interesting features. Plenty of shade walking through the wooded areas. There is a path that will take you as far as the cable car entrance. After this it becomes more challenging. Couple of quaint little gift shops and cafes on the way. Took about 90 mins to walk down, photo stops included. Don't try this walk in flip flops.If you like great views this is a worthwhile journey, but that's it. There is very little left of the castle now except the main walls, very little to see. If you do decide to walk down it does take you off the beaten track a little."
214,Beautiful views ,"Very cozy historical place. Comfortable for walks and safe. Many different fruit trees all over. Very beautiful views while climbing up the hill and air humidity changing. Most important is the view from the lookout. You can get there by bus, taxi and walking. I recommend taking an evening walk up and the bus during the day."
215,Brilliant view,"Get a taxi up here & back down unless you're going to walk down, the wear good shoes for the path down through the other parts of the castle to the Mosque etc & the cable car for a ride down to cleopatra beach."
216,Cool place,One of my favorite place in Alanya. I always visit there many times in my holidays. Day time you can see different things than nights. I recommend to visit both time. Absolutely beautiful sunset! You can see and feel history and its nice to walk around Kalesi.
217,History ,"Very old and historical castle. Seeing some houses and building inside the castle is very bad, but still great place."
218,The walk is worth the view,When you travel with family to Alanya &Antalya try to provide a car to enjoy more and save time. You will see great views of city from castle.
219,Spectacular views ,Nice view from the castle. Castle is maybe to big word for this because its ruined.But road to the castle and views are amazing.
220,Great views,This place have really good view if you are in Alanya you should be see this place. Here is icon of Alanya
221,Must see of Alanya,Only for fans of photography or history! Super hot. For me nothing interesting. But maybe someone will love it. It was super hot! Almost no shadow. View really amazing! But...
222,A must see,An ancient 1200 ad castle in great condition. Renovation work in being done but it doesn't interfere with the tour. Plenty of castle to explore and the views are exceptional. Well worth a visit.
223,Great view,"One of the best places in alanya, and with teleferik u can get free bustrip both ways. This is must place to visit."
224,For those who like walking and exploring,"Nice walk and nice view. On the way, There was also an old mosque with Greenery and flowery trees around it."
225,Walk the Castle and enjoy the fantastic view,"It's easy to go by 🚡 teleferik. Suitable for families, couples and lonely wonderers. Up there you can enjoy turkish cuisine, photographing, shopping, history, culture, religious places or just beauty of quietness or other peoples company. You can choose and have a memorable day. I enjoy every time up there."
226,impressive,We reached the castle by bus  - take the number 8 (opposite burger king) you can take a Taxi - there are plenty about in town and at the top to get up and down.  The castle had stunning views but I felt 15TL was a bit pricey for nothing to see castle wise.  It was nice to take plenty of pictures.  We walked about half way down to see more views and people's homes etc.  There are plenty of restaurants etc if you want to have lunch/dinner with a view
227,ecxellant,"The views are breathtaking. I am not sure if it's worthy to pay 20 lira (~3 euros) to visit the top castle ""museum"" since it hasn't that much to offer for the price, but the funicular ""floor"" and mosque ""floor"" are definitely worth the visit. Many platforms to take pictures."
228,Best view in Alanya,You take a cable car to the top. And then there is about a 45 minutes walk from one side and back. And then you take the cable back down.It is a nice site to see; and a nice walk; as you walk up you can see the beach and half of Alanya. There is also a mosque inside at the back that you can visit whilst you are up there. This was part of my Alanya tour in my excursions. You will have to pay entry of 16 Liras. Would recommend to do whilst you are there; its a nice walk and a beautiful view.
229,Best destination for plants lovers,"The castle complex covers most of the mountainous peninsula that extends between Cleopatra beach and Alanya harbour.  There is claimed to be 6.5 kilometres of walls with 140 towers.  My advice is to start at the harbour side, buy the combined Shipyard, Red Tower and Damlatas Cave ticket and visit the first of those two attractions and the Cannon House, looking also at the walls along the coast, and stretching up the hillside towards, the first of the small uphill castles.  After that, unless you are very fit you need to get the bus (number 4) to go up the mountain to the highest of the castles that make up this complex of fortifications. Its over 800 feet up and several kilometres via a winding road. The bus can be picked up opposite the tourist office, but I confess to taking a taxi for 20 Lire to get to the top rather than waiting for an infrequent bus service.  The top castle has stunning views but there is not a great deal to see inside it other than the ruins of an ancient church. A 20 Lire ticket gives access to the top Castle (Citadel) and the lower one on the landward side.  From the citadel you can walk downhill to the landward castle if you take a narrow footpath alongside a restaurant down a track on your left after leaving the citadel.  This will take you to a small mausoleum with a minaret, then to a big mosque and the lower castle which you go through to reach the cable car down to the beach by Damlatas Cave.  When I arrived the cable car was closed for repair.  Faced with going back uphill to get a bus down or walking down I chose the latter, initially through pine woods, then down a steep and rough track to pick up the road down to the beach and cave."
230,"Great view all around, especially with nice weather","Glad we went as a break from just laying in the sun all day. It's only 15 Lira to get in and it is pretty much just the castle walls, a few buildings which you can't go in and an old Catholic church. Gorgeous views across Alanya and the marina. If it's your first time going, once finished walking around the castle grounds, follow the road and down a bit and there is a dirt path that takes you down one of the outer castle walls. On the way down there is an old church and some stunning views which can't be seen from the castle."
231,Well worth a visit with beautiful views,The best view and nice place must see specially by the night to and see you will like it for sure have a good time there
232,Amazing view,"Nice with a perfect view , there is an entrance fees 15 TL per person or you can enter with the museum card ."
233,History and good wiev,"I took a walk from the cable car station(on the hill). It is very beautiful place with great view. If you don't want to walk, you can drive from other side. I took so many beautiful photos from there. You must visit !"
234,Beautiful Views but pricey entrance,"took the cable car to the top  £4 then had a walk round the old ruins till i paid £3 to access the fort and well wortht the money and effort,i walked down rather than go back the same way its a rocky route but very intresting"
235,Impressive,Castle (two parts) with breathtaking views! So nice...!!! Long way there. But as we saw: they are building a cable car there.
236,Beautifull place,"We are quite an active couple so we had always planned that we would walk up to the Castle, to the surprise of the staff in the hotel who thought we were crazy. The walk itself is not that bad at all its more the heat so if you just make sure you have water and go at your own pace you'll be fine. When we actually got the Castle we weren't blown away, nothing really stands out...But once you get to the view point it is 100% worth it, you get an incredible view of both sides of Alanya. If you visit Alanya you just have to do it!"
237,Expect more for the price,Sooooo romantic up there! Dinner was a little bit expensive probably because of the vieuw...but really good food! We had the fish of the day. Fresh fish and as a starter also we had fish. The best fish I have ever had.
238,take taxi if you are not a good walker,"We walk'ed(!!!) up to the Castle. Its not an easy walk, and If The Sun is Shining, please remember water! I'f you arn't that dit, it Can take you an hour on a bumpy Way, that goes up and up.On The Way there are some spectacular fotostops, where you have a great view over The harbour and Alanya City!The Castle is tone. There are some ruins and reservoirs, and a log of fantastic vielsesring to both sides of The sea. The Price to get in was 15tl each."
239,Worth the Walk or Ride,"Well worth a visit,the taxi driver will wait a hour for you while you look round.15 tl to get in, smaller than I thought it would be but stunning views over Alanya.We went when the sun was just going down so lovely."
240,A beatyfull place to watch the sunset,Getting work done the now and new cable cars fitted lovely vows outstandingPlease note closes at 7pm
241,"We went there for dinner, most romantic place with that vieuw!","If you are interested in nature, history and ethnography, you should visit to the Castle of Alanya. You can go to the Castle either by walk (if you like trekking), by car or by the cable car. It is a large area reflecting old Alanya life as well as traces of ancient civilizations such as Helens, Seljukians, and Ottomans. In the area, there are asome cafés and restaurants as well as ethnographically decorated old houses, old mosque, and souvenir shops."
242,Nice break from the zBeach,"Value for money the food was delicious I enjoyed it very silly just salad with chicken and pasta, the people who work on the boats work very hard for there money, value for money had the most enjoyable experience 🇹🇷🇹🇷🏖️🚢⛴️"
243,Nice but overrated,"From this vantage point, particularly at night-time, you can get the most beautiful panoramic view of Alanya. On our first or second night there, we met up with a friend who lives locally in Alanya and brought us to the Castle. We stopped off at a bar located on the mountainside which has the most perfect place to take photos and is just so cosy. The Castle itself is spectacular since it overlooks Alanya and we went back two or three times during our week's trip to enjoy the scenery and take the ride on the cable-car which was inexpensive."
244,Amazing location ,Went to the castle today we walked to the bottom after failing to get the bus. A taxi driver did us a great deal took us up there showed us 4 different areas we probably wouldn't have known about on our own. Great scenary well worth a visit all the better for our guide
245,Alanya - Turkey - Alanya Castle - Good remains and Great Views,"Visited 3 times. Once at night via the cable car for the views. Once by cable car then walked through the castle,and citadel and walked down , and the third time wnt by bus and walked back down a different way. It's hot but there is lots to see, the site is very extensive, and has magnificent views of the city, harbour and mountains."
246,Sunset,"Instead of lying on the beach me and my friend decided to take a teleferik lift to the hill. Easy to go although needs good shoes and a lot of water in a hot day. There were some butiks of course but local handmade with better quality. On the top a nice little cafe with a friendly stuff. I recommend! But please remember no smoking, many tourists didn’t follow with that and so dry environment it’s not safe at all."
247,good place to visit,Very nice and chilled beachWe spend very good time there.I recommend it if you are already passing by. But don't go from far place just to see it.
248,Beautiful view,Very great place to see absolutely beautiful stunning views. Castle was fab gave details of historical information.
249,Went up for sunset,Walk up is hard. Get Dolmus from Dalmatas car park 2.50 T.L.  and walk down. Slow walk and a few photo stops will take about an hour coming down. Few watering holes but thy charge more.
250,History ,"You can pay 3 lira to get a bus or 20 lira to get a taxi to the top! I would advise doing this and taking a slow walk to the bottom which would take about 30-40 minutes.I would recommend making a stop for some freshly squeezed orange juice and to the alaturka cafe on the way down.The views are amazing, you cannot visit alanya and not go."
251,Cheap tourist day out.,We visited it with city tour . Gorgeous views and nice history of place make it must be to see in Alanya. Really amazing at day and night
252,very interesting,u cn go by teleferic frm kleopatra beach or by bus.there is an amazing view of alanya and the pier bt u have to walk there and its a bit hard specialy with the very warm weather
253,The castle that we can see from hotel room,We came here by accident. Just went for a walk. Paid the enterance to see the castle and also found the old shipyard. Lovely place you must visit!
254,Beautiful architecture and gorgeous views ,"It has two parts: one is free and another one you have to pay for. We visited both of them. The one you have to pay for has more to offer. Again, parking is not free. Take your student card (if you have one) as it can give you some discount if you chose to visit a second part of the castle. The second part has many spectaculars views and it is possible to go there with a stroller."
255,nice interesting one day cruise,It has amazing views both day time and night time. You can find food and drink and cultural activities.
256,Morning visit,"Lovely quite place, so tranquill and amazing scenery been twice now will deffo be back 1 year lovely place is alanya many things to do like boat trips, cave trips, visit dimcay for swimming and food lovely experienced up in the mountains"
257,Castle not that great but the view is worth it!,Sunset before a lovely meal really enjoy this trip and met people that I would like to know for the rest of my life good and friendly.
258,Great experience ,"The castle of Alanya you can find almost on the Top of the Hill of Alanya, situated between the boulevard and the harbor of Alanya. You can reach the castle by a cable lift. The castle is surrounded with rocks, some restplaces and a restaurant. There are also souvenirshops. But the most important near the castle are the beautiful picture and sightseeing places with a beautiful and excellent view over Alanya. A great place to stay!"
259,Place is average but the view is excellent,Excellent views and photo opportunities; Access via cable car on main road near harbour. 18 lira return pp - good value. Then longish walk to castle precincts uphill - no good for people with mobility problems. Worth the effort for others.
260,Alanya Excursions,Fun trip not awsome castle but Nice and good vieuw we liked.worth the visit!                                                    We took Tour with subweb travel agency iT was good day with meal and waterfun
261,Alayna's land mark ,"We traveled with a cable car. Thank God we did. On the top this summer, it peaked 40 degrees, but as long as you hydrate, you will be fine. Up on the top, is it nice to walk around and enjoy the views. We found this little museum. On a way back to the cable cart, we found a guide who offered to show us a closed of area. There we visited Cleopatra’s old room with a breathtaking view over Cleopatra beachI am very glad we took a trip to the old castle. Very recommended"
262,Beautiful place ,"Travelled via a Dolmos from our hotel (Sunprime C Lounge) and then took another Dolmos (No 4) to the top. The total for one person to the top, one way, was around 5tl. Much cheaper than a taxi. Entry is 15tl. People say you can walk all the way up and down but unless you're a marathon runner who can bear the scorching heat it's probably best sticking to the Dolmos hahaa. It's around 5km in distance. Not much to do inside but the scenery is beautiful so can take plenty of pictures. On exit, you are greeted with orange juice (10-15tl) and also a lovely corn stall (3.5tl- would highly recommend). Took a Dolmos back to the bottom, need to make sure you get off at the right stop or you will go back to the castle."
263,Breathtaking! ,"I was a nice cruise, visiting the castel, admire the hunting fish, admire the jumping of one men from more then 25 m high, and also swim in the midle of now where in the see, ending with the show of foam...recomand it. it was in july 2010"
264,Castle,"Took a bus from Pegasos Royal to Alanya centre bus station, then took the number 4 bus to Alanya Castle, took about 15 mins and dropped us at the entry gates.Cost 24 TL for an adult ticket, free for our 5 year old daughter.Not much climbing, walkways were easy to get around.Views were incredible from the top! We got to the top at 1pm, just in time to witness the 1pm call to prayer sounding out from the mosque next to the castle, and all the others down in the town joining in, with the combined sound bouncing off the hills around the town - incredible!Photo guy with a parrot, check! We had a few snaps of our daughter holding a parrot then quickly left for our return bus, which arrived back exactly 1 hour after dropping us off. Plenty of time to look around and take photos etc. Theres a few shops/stalls at the castle gates to grab water, ice creams and souvenirsWell worth a visit if you are in town!"
265,Nice place to visit ,"As others have said, this is a long way up, and a stiff climb, but worth it for the views. The walls are some 4.5 kms long and the site has been fortified since Greek times. What can be seen today dates mainly from the Seljuk beylerik. Most of the site is free to visit, although the main kale, the Ehmedek charges 15TL."
266,Visit,"Alanya castle, is most important from this town, is a great landmark from this area, a door as a business card to the city."
267,lovely view,The rock with the castle is dividing Alayna's beaches in two.Cleopatra beach and Bougainville beach.The castle is located on top of the rock. For many years you have to go by feet or take a taxi to get to the castle. Now you can go by cable- cabin from the west part of the rock. A nice rather short ride.Worth to try
268,Nice to spend a few hours,"Very authentic and romantic place with  great views from above. We went there with taxi and came down half-walk, half-bus."
269,Stunning,"Taksi drivers to tell you it's impossible to climb the castle on your own. Ofcourse you can pay and get to the High District by car, but it's not that exciting. Start your trip at 7 AM so that you see all by noon, it's very hot after that."
270,A favourite with all our Villa Guests,"We used the cable car to go up and then walked all the way around. I have to warn you that first you, you need proper footwear, would NOT wear sandals on this as in places it feels like a treck and difficult if you have kids under 5. I had to carry my 3 year olds pram and bag around and this made it doubly difficult as they only have steps at the beginning, as you go higher it’s pretty much rock and ruins so can be difficult for a family. However, all that said, it is well worth the effort as you get some of the best views of Alanya and some amazing vistas. There’s a lovely Masjid on the way as well as lots of quaint little stalls selling their wears and the people were very reasonable. I do think the local authorities are missing a trick and should put decking on in the top part as well and also they should restore the buildings like the seljuk baths and the ammunition depots, it would make the trip much more worthwhile and memorable. It’s still a great experience though and I would recommend it. Just be prepared if you have young children with you and travel light! 😃"
271,Good to see,It was a very interesting experience and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We were left to wander round and take it at our own pace.
272,Amazing view,Alagna castle is very old more than 3 to 4000  year old and surrounded wall around and you can have really good feeling why are you walking around the castle and watch two 360° all Alagna panorama looking and all you can walk all the way down to the castle go to the red tower and shipyard
273,Great view,Paid equivalent of £40 in TL there and back from our hotel. Not worth it. Nothing special up there just a good place for views and taking photos.
274,Stunning views ,"Got there by the cable car, a lot of old ruins, walls, a mosque, few shops and great Gardenia restaurant, fantastic views towards the port and Kleopatra beach on the other side. Worth visiting."
275,beautiful views from here.,"Alanya Castle was built mostly by Seljuk Empire, and it is still quite intact. At first sight it affects and attracts you. We started our visit from shipyard, it was öne of the great examples of shipyards in middle ages, you could imagine there are small ships vaiting for repair. Also, cove just in front of shipyard was really beautiful and you can swim in it. You can walk on walls of the castle with great view of Alanya, houses inside the walls are also old and beautiful. Red tower is a fantastic defence tower, it also has a great view. Inner castle is on the top of the hill, each corner of it is a gate to history, you can close your eyes and imagine. View of Sea and Alanya is also great from there."
276,alanya castle ,"There is a possibility to reach by rope way. Especially we would like to thank you very much for the lady who sells yemen, who serves goat horn. From Ehmedek you can see her walking on foot."
277,Super nice place ,"Many people goes to kale observe old fortress and enjoy nice view to the city and sea. But here are growing a lot of plants with spread to Europe, for example, hypericum. The best time for that visit this place is april."
278,Evening visit recommended,"Take the cable car, it costs 18 TL during the day and 20 TL during the night. Going up you have the perfect view of Kleopatra beach and the pirate ships. After descending from the cable car, you go up on a wooden path. Step by step the beauty of Alanya is unraveled before your eyes. First you see only yhe trees and the old ruins of the citadel. Then, going up you begin to see the bay, the Alanya Deniz Feneri, the port, and the other part of the city. On top of the hill there is the Suleymanie Mosque, built by Suleyman the Magnificent. It is worth visiting."
279,Good view,Im feel very happy..because i see in castle here very very nice i love here i want stay here you can came to see..
280,Mysterious Place,"Take bus number 4 to the top of the hill (2.5 tl each way) else walk up takes 45 mins, fantastic well maintained castle plenty to see amazing views of the coast line. Entrance fee 15tl, take a head covering ladies if you intend to enter the mosque and also it is very hot inside the castle grounds you will need the shade.you can pick up a small history of the castle and all of its components free at the Tourist Information."
281,Amazing views of Alanya,"Second time in side and second tour with selale tours, Alex is the man, bit of a character but always friendly, reliable and reasonably priced, always ready with water,tea,juice and friendly advice. Last year we took the boat tour to Manavgat, full day with a decent lunch included @ £15.00A head.This year we took the jeep safari into the green canyon. Again full day with lunch @ £15.00 pp, great value and a great day out.Swimming in the green lake after being in an open top 4x4 was amazingly refreshing.Thanks to Alex and the guys at Selale tours.When we're back in side…we book with Alex."
282,"Great on the outside, not much inside",Alanya is the best plade to live and specially the alanya kastle cafe and than geting bu teleferik is also super panoramic
283,Special walk,The castle stands on the high peninsula between the two main bays in Alanya. Mainly developed in the thirteenth century on fiormer smaller fortifications the castle has two distinct areas. The forward sea facing element which is accessed now via a ticket and the set back internal walled area which houses a number of smaller buildings and chapels etc. The main forward castle area costs 15TL for access and is well worth the trip as the views across both sides of Alanya are superb. There's not much left of the castle but the fortification walls are pretty much there and are undergoing restoration. The lower area is accessible for free and one of the highlights for me was seeing the walls lit up in the evening from Alanya town. Take a bus or a taxi to the top to visit the castle and you'll not be disappointed on the views. The castle itself is a little disappointing though.
284,Nice view,"Rude arrogant staff, very dissatisfied and very disappointing trip, not worth the money total waste of a day.Be advised don't book with Alayna Tours"
285,Very nice view,"If you need to test your patience, then you are on the right place.Lovely traffic jam will do that for you.Thank you very much."
286,"Boring, but Nice view","Absolutely worth going. Specially night time walking up and see sunset and all the light of city of Alanya. Walk up feels long, but it´s worth it. You also can take taxi to Castle down from the city or go with teleferik-elevator. How ever you want to go up, you really should do it :)"
287,Superb Castle on the hillside of Alanya,"This is where my wife and I of 60 years decided our first time. Amazing, would make love here again and I love the scenery."
288,Great views pity not much to see at castle,"Went on the bus to alanya a couple times , took public transport from club kastalia , the cost was so cheap , very clean city lots to do small fun fair , good beaches , marina worth a vist"
289,A must see,This was my number one on the list.It did not disappoint me in anyway.Used the new cable car to reach the top.Views across all of alanya city.
290,Perfect view,Very trustworthy and exceptional prices. The staff are friendly and well informed and the experience made the holiday. Thank you Alanya Excursions
291,Perfect castel,"Even though a town of aprox 300,000 inhabitants, Alanya has its own history. Alanya Kalesi is one of the places that you can visit during your stay here."
292,The castle,"The Alanya fortress in its present form dates to the 13th century. There is a museum and Mosque at the top and exhibitions about the history of Alanya as well as stalls selling traditional handicrafts of the region such as carpets. You can climb the fortress by foot (for free), but its better to take the cable car for amazing views of the mediterreanean sea on one side and the city on the other."
293,Amazing Castle and should be on the Must Visit List!,"If you are traveling to Turkey, I suggest you see Alanya.  You will not be disappointed.  The Mediterranean sea is beautiful, the weather is also very beautiful."
294,Kalesi Alanya,The history behind the castle sends goosebumps up my arms just thinking about it. Try and be there at sunset as the views across the bay are stunning
295,Alex is here ,"My partner and I took a trip up here during an excursion. So in fairness we didn't stay long, and so my review is not as extensive as others may be.The views from the Kalesi are truly amazing, and it's well worth going up there just for that. The restaurants and cafe's on the hill leading up to it are also great. But the Kalesi itself we found to be quite average. We were ushered in quickly enough, and walked along the wooden pathway to the viewing platfrom. Here you'll find an man with a parrot and a camera who you can have a photo with (for a fee of course). But we weren't really shown anything other than that really. Perhaps our tour guide was just a bit rubbish.. I'd be interested to hear if we were just let down by our guide, but I wouldn't pay to get back into the Kalesi again."
296,Amazing views!!,Visited here with my partner and our three youngest a couple of weeks ago.  We took the cable car up and back (which the children enjoyed).  This is more of a fortress than a castle and affords great views.  There is also a little mosque and a little house that you can visit.  Well worth a visit.
297,Fun,This tour company is run by thieves. I paid a total of £52.00 in pound sterling to the owner/operator of the company in cash. For two separate tours. The owners name is ALEX he calls himself ALEX and KEMAL. I paid for both the Manavgat boat tour and the Green canyon village tour. The manavgat boat tour was booked for a Thursday and was supposed to be with everything included as that is what the owner said and that is what is written on the leaflets. He said there would be a charge of the equivalent of 1 euro to enter the waterfalls which is understandable but when we boarded the boat they asked for 25 Turkish Lira per person which is equivalent to 5 euros per person. Later we arrived at the manavgat waterfalls we were told 30 minutes to take pictures and look around. We returned to the bus after 20 minutes and the bus had left us there. We then paid for taxis to take us to the manavgat markets where we supposed to go next on our tour but the bus was not there. The second tour which was booked for sunday at the green canyon village tour was also supposed to be everything included. When we boarded the coach we found everything was EXTRA and not included. We paid extra for another boat and fishing trip and were told when we arrived we have to pay extra and that we had booked with their office so they could not do anything about it. When i asked the man on the tour bus to phone ALEX the owner he couldn't speak English but called ALEX. When i asked ALEX why he charged extra and asked for money back on the phone he began swearing and shouting and saying he would not give me my money back. This company charges extra for packages it does not deliver. Please stay away or lose money to these thieves.
298,It's a wall on a very hot hill,This castle have been built by Seljuk Emperor Alaaddin Keykubat at 13th century. Looks like Chinese wall. Attractive historical destination.
