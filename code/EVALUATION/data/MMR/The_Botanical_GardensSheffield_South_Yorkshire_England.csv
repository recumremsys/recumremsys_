0,Colourful in Autumn,We visited here at the end of September.  Wow the gardenersdo an excellent job here.  So many flowers and plants and so much colour.  Took a photo of the map at the entrance to find our way around.  Considering this garden  is free to visit I would recommend anyone coming to Sheffield to pay a visit.  It is as good as Kew Gardens just smaller
1,Waste of time ,We visited the Botanical Gardens last summer for a craft event.It's a very nice place for a short visit and also has a cafe if you fancy lunch there.Be aware though that it's a bit steep in places!
2,Really enjoyable place,The garden is simply awesome. Some lovely hardwotking staff have maintained it pretty well. Was able to see some plants and trees from around the world under one roof which was spectacular. Especially my 6 year old enjoyed being there.Highly recommend for families to visit with their kids. Thank you
3,Ideal peaceful place for a walk,Our son took us here after lunch for a Sunday afternoon stroll. Never been here before but very pleasant & the greenhouses were open and have some good plant specimens.
4,"Car parking, except for the disabled, is not easy.","These botanical gardens are lovely, a real gem and a credit to the staff that look after them. We visited at the weekend so got rather wet! But still managed to enjoy the gardens and the hot house.Fabulous array of plants from around the world and some quite stunning cactus."
5,Beautiful and peace place People so obviously work hard to tend these beautiful special beds.,Pleasant gardens even on a autumnal day. The greenhouses were very good. Nicely laid out. I imagine it will be spectacular in the spring and summer seasons. Well worth the visit.
6,Unpleasant posh locals.,These are beautiful gardens and lovely large greenhouses.We have visited in summer and winter and both times have found plenty to look at and admire
7,Really nice area,"We make a point of visiting the gardens when the magnificent display of crocus are out.The park is nicely kept although I object to parents playing football with children ruining the grass.     It attracts families and dog walkers and is especially busy when the weather is nice.Parking can be difficult.The cafe is Ok service is poor with young students who probably don't want to be there. Chairs and tables outside could be cleaner, disappointing scones are not ready when cafe opens.    Please be aware on our last visit there was a wedding and the toilets had been closed to accommodate this.   Needs more public toilets as you are not allowed to use the kitchen toilet due to Health and Safety  in my opinion the cafe should  not open if they cannot provide this service."
8,Lovey ,"Me and the partner come here all the time . Very well kept and has beautiful landscapes throughout the seasons. The squirrels are a great attraction for the kids, but plants look healthy and are lovely"
9,Green and pleasant getaway,Botanical Gardens are beautiful all year round. There’s a lovely cafe call the Curator and perfect to sit out in the summer.They offer hot and cold food and drinks. There is also plenty of seating inside.The bear pit which is from the Victorian era is interesting and there’s alway hungry squirrels to food. There not shy and come close. Adults and children alike enjoy feeding them.The gardens themselves are stunning in all seasons but none more than in summer .There is plenty of grass area for picnicking or simply sun bathing whist reading a book .And of of course the glass house is simply stunning housing exotic planes.You can also get married there.
10,Lovely garden,Beautiful gardens and interesting hot houses. The staff in the greenhouses are happy to talk about the plants and the different zones.The cafe has a nice terrace when the weather is good.
11,Very Pleasant Gardens,Always love to visit the botanical gardens for a walk around. Especially in spring and summer. Well maintained and beautiful.
12,Lovely March afternoon ,We had a lovely walk around the stunning gardens and tropical house. Perfect for a picnic if the weathers nice. Nice cafe for a coffee or lunch.
13,Always peaceful,"What a find, gardens are beautiful ,lovely walks and lots to see.Changes with the seasons obviously, so always something new to see."
14,Botanical gardens,"We were looking forward to our first visit but were sorely disappointed.  The plants in the pretty glass pavilions are uncared for and looking very sad.  One of the large beds in the garden is infested with Equisetum and a gardener was just chopping it off on the surface which is a completely ineffectual remedy.  Weeds abound.  Four men were casually working on one small bed putting in bedding plants when two would have been sufficient.  This place needs a proper professional head gardener.  Award winning gardens like Renishaw can deliver perfection with just four gardeners.  Come on Sheffield, get your act together!"
15,Beautiful Botanics!!,We went late afternoon/early evening so we only saw about a dozen other people. What a wonderful place. Most of the trees and shrubs were labelled as well as some of the flowers. Fragrances changed as we wandered through. Spent about an hour just taking in the peaceful atmosphere. The glass  houses and cafe were shut so a return visit is needed.
16,Love the glass house ,"We visited this garden in February on a very cold day but there was still much to see both inside the Pavilions (warm and sheltered) and outside. If you looked carefully, there was plenty in flower including snowdrops, hellebores, witch hazel and Christmas box. The box had a wonderful scent and the witch hazel had various colours from lemon yellow to orange. To warm up we visited the cafe for coffees and bacon sandwiches, yum!"
17,Hidden Gem,"I saw 10CC here in the summer and it's such a gorgeous venue with a great (if expensive) bar and lots of toilets (no queue!). They also sell the local Our Cow Molly ice cream, which is lovely.I don't know about the place when nothing is on though, I've only visited for an event, but it is very picturesque :)"
18,A lovely place  to wander,"I visited this Botanical garden,last year when it was my first day out with my girlfriend.actually was a good option since we both wanted to visit the gardens.i liked the flowers and little squirrels inside this big botanical park.and i definitely recommend a visit inside winter garden since you can see some, out of Europe ,trees and plants."
19,Dogs not kept on a lead and unsupervised kids climbing trees.,"We were visiting Sheffield and as it was a pleasant day went to the Botanical Gardens. It’s a lovely place, something I wish we had closer to home. Such a nice place to walk around or sit and relax. Nice to see people of all ages visiting."
20,Nice walk and cafe,"My partner is from Sheffield and she showed me the gardens and for the size of it, it’s really good. Peaceful and great feature in Sheffield-worth having a look if your around sheffield or need to relax for a few minutes."
21,Beautiful,I love this garden. So much to see and the squirrels are so friendly! There’s a nice toilet block on site too.
22,"Beautiful plants, nice walk.",We took the grandkids here and what a beautiful place to spend a couple of hours. We had a lovely stroll through and a walk through the glass House the kids loved it. This really is a credit to Sheffield very well maintained clean and tidy. Must be ten years since we came here but won't leave it so long next time.
23,Beautiful gardens,Hadn’t visited for years. The gardens are just so lovely. Plenty of quiet places to sit. Had a scone and cup of tea at the cafe which was very pleasant and the scone was delicious 😋 would highly recommend a visit.
24,Nice for a walk,"As per previous reviews- the Botanicals is stunning whatever the weather and we picked an especially lovely day to visit after Endcliffe Park with our new baby.The squirrels were particularly boisterous which is always an absolute pleasure to meet them.Our baby girl loved the place and even though it was a flying visit, we are delighted she loves it just as much as we do.Immaculately kept as always (well done staff!) and its great to see the fountain having a bit of TLC also."
25,Lovely quiet place in the edge of Sheffield and most calming and pleasurable.,We brought a dog here and had a nice walk through lovely gardens. Parked at bottom of hill (Tesco parking lot). We came to the gates at the top of the park next to the tea shop and some other store. Tea shop was dog friendly but the store owner is not. I would not give her any business.
26,Beautiful gardens,"Very nice gardens near the heart of town. Lots of space, plants and a stunning glasshouse. Free entry too. Also a nice cafe on site."
27,Gardner’s Treat,I remember when the place had an Avery and tropical fish ‘ I remember the parrots outside. The place is ok but not the same. Less is not the best. Bring back the best
28,Beautiful Place To Visit,We went there on our last morning as it was two minutes from the hotel. It was absolutely delightful. It is small but perfectly formed with a huge variety of trees. Total peace.
29,Opens up the enticing prospect of further visits in different seasons,"Amazing  , calm and relaxing. I have been around also in spring and summer and I truly love this place . Good maintenance and very clean."
30,Something of interest all the year around,What a beautiful well maintained place. I went with friends & children & took a picnic. It was stunning & the little cafe was so friendly x
31,Beautiful even in January!,"What a delightful place, especially in the Spring, a riot of colour. Great for all ages, a nice cafe in the north east corner. Lots of hungry squirrels for the kids to feed."
32,Lovely gardens,"Took a walk round here after dropping off our son at university. Very beautiful, nicely laid out, great variety of plants and trees. Didn’t use the cafe so no idea about that. Will definitely go again when we visit him. I think dogs are allowed but on leads."
33,A great relaxing location in the summer,Beautiful gardens with a tropical hot house. The squirrels really are friendly. Well worth a visit. Plenty of seating and comfortable seating areas.
34,Magical illuminations ,Been here many times it's different every visitIts so peaceful even when busy The flower  bed are so well maintained Hopefully a return visit soon in the spring time hopefully
35,Nice surprise ,"Have visited the gardens on numerous occasions and always admire the high level of maintenance and care for them. Even in the winter there’s always birds, squirrels and a few plants to see. It is so relaxing to walk around the gardens, head to the cafe for a hot drink and some lovely pastries. Well worth a visit. Highly recommended"
36,A well kept garden,The gardens are not huge but they are very well kept. It's a little green paradise really close to town.
37,Parents visiting uni student,"Loved this place. Recommended to us by my daughter. Great service, great food, reasonable prices. Lovely clean restaurant. It has a garden/fairy lights theme which makes a lovely setting. Cocktails available. Children allowed."
38,Escafeld art society,Great place for a walk round. Beautiful flowers and plants all named and a lovely sight for squirrels and birds. Well kept and maintained gardens. Would highly recommend a visit
39,Illuminate ,"This is a must visit place. It’s free and a very beautiful garden and greenhouses. Just do it. The selection of plants from around the world is superb, nothing else like it in South Yorkshire."
40,So many hidden gems,A very pleasant walk and hosts some brilliant events throughout the year.  The cafe is usually good although the last time we ate there the bread in the sandwich was mouldy so that’s put me off.  I’ll probably give it another go though as it’s so handy!
41,£1.40,I had some friends visiting from London so arranged a formal guided tour of the gardens from one of the volunteers. I have never had a formal tour before although have visited the gardens many times. The guided tour was great and really worth doing. We paid £30 for a group of 6. You can book via the website. Would thoroughly recommend.
42,Glorious colour,"I'am really impressed with the hard work that goes into the high level of maintenance of this garden. Well dome to everyone involved! The Botanical Gardens can be visited all year round, no matter what the occasion. It is so relaxing to walk around the gardens especially during the morning before walk. There is a very nice cafe - great for a hot drink and some delicious cakes. I would highly recommend visiting whether it's with friends, family, loved ones, walking the dogs and strolling the gardens with children. Also keep an eye out for events held throughout the year such as firework displays, concerts and plays!"
43,Wonderful park,An absolutely stunning and peaceful place. I had a field day with my camera. Beautiful collection of plant species. An absolute joy to have a slow wander around.
44,Stunning well kept gardens,Absolutely beautiful. We had a lovely afternoon in the gardens even the rain didn’t dampen our spirits. Highly recommend!
45,Great,"I have been coming here for over twenty years and I think the gardens are looking more inviting than ever. There are obvious signs of work and everything is looking really good. Maybe it was the weather but the feel in the gardens was just lovely! Every time I visit I see something new. Please visit, it's a lovely place to wander in and escape from the city for a few minutes."
46,great scenery,"Really is a beautiful spot in Sheffield all year round, I am very luck that my garden backs onto the Botanical Gardens! Must recomend their Firework display for Bonfire night, just simply beautiful"
47,"Beautiful area to spend
Some chill out time",I love walking around here. Beautiful well kept gardens to enjoy a pic nic. Nice relaxing area. Dog friendly. Nice cafe.
48,Disabled Access,"Went to visit the Botanical Gardens and was bowled over by the size. There are acres of it. Ple ry of disabled parking and everywhere we went my mobility scooter could travel easily even in the Tropical Pavilion that held plants from all over the world. There was a lovely little gift shop and a wonderful cafe which catered for everyone. It is well worth a look, don't forget your walking shoes."
49,Lovely Gardens,The botanical garden collection was interesting and I recognized some of the types of flora that we have in Florida. The gardens are lovely and I'm glad there are plenty of park benches as my knee was acting up. Their little café was a nice respite from the showers thaqt blew through while I was visiting.
50,It is what it says on the tin,"Stunning gardens, and so peaceful.  Don't miss the 'greenhouse' with it's exotic collection of plants.  Also there''s a great 'treasure hunt' using clues to take you around all the most interesting parts. Lovely cafe there. Often have music on in the summer months too. One of Sheffield's little treasures."
51,Beautiful surprise!,"Breathtaking! Its full of freshness and color.We visited twice, once for a moonlight cinema and the other time for a picnic"
52,Gardens.,"The design of the floral layout is spectacular, clearly ordered and well kept. Would definitely recommend to visit with family or friends."
53,Sunday morning stroll.,Loved it here. Came on a sunny day and it was quite busy. Parking was a bit of a struggle but we found a space on a side road not too far.Lovely areas to sit in the sun.
54,"Stunning gardens, highly recommend",These gardens are very peaceful and I took advantage of the lovely spring weather to sit here with a coffee. Lovely little tea rooms with seats outside. Would recommend a visit!
55,Beautiful gardens,"The Gardens are lovely, the volunteers have saved them from council cuts. Colourful and rare plants abound everywhere. The parking is awful tho and if you are disabled it is almost impossible to park."
56,Saturday in sunshine,Another wonderful place to visit any time of the year. An oasis in the city. The plants and atmosphere are fantastic
57,Mr Harrison,"Enjoyed every visit, very calm and you just have to love the trees, flowers and their designs :) feeling quite relaxed when I’m walking around there. Take your young kids to learn about the nature and spend quality time with them!"
58,Not as good.,Visited on a gloomy wet October day but we were blown away by these beautiful gardens. We would have happily paid to walk round. The people of Sheffield are so lucky to have this amazing place. We will definitely be back hopefully on a sunny day.
59,Great calm oasis of ecclesall road,"The botanical a gardens were a welcome diversion when we had a family member in the nearby hospital. We saw them covered in snow and a few days later, with the spring bulbs starting to flower, particularly the snowdrops. The greenhouse was well looked after with a good range of plants from around the world. It was lovely to see a protea in flower so far away from home (Cape Town)"
60,Good if you like the nature ^^.,Lovely afternoon with some old friends visiting Sheffield for a few days! Bit cold but was glad there was no snow!
61,A lovely walk not spoilt!?!!!,It has been 20 years that I have been in this places how lovely and the lunch at the cafe was fantastic what wonderful food and staff had a 2 hours of chilling and enjoyable lunch
62,Best way to relax!,"We walked all over these gardens, and they were magnificent! So many different areas to explore and types of gardens to wander through.  It was also amazing to see so many people taking advantage of the public space and spending time out doors.  The glass houses were amazing too.  Definitely worth it, and completely free."
63,Beautiful ,"A great place for the children and adults too, we had food at the cafe and it was great for all the family, great things to see and walk round the grounds, the greenhouse was god and something to see but the main attraction for the children was feeding the squirrels"
64,Credit to Sheffield,The weather was grim but we had a lovely stroll around the gardens. I'm sure that our next visit...which will probably be late spring...will find plenty more to look at. An added bonus was an abundance  of remarkably tame squirrels. Very pleasant
65,Nice place,"Pleasent surroundings to leisurely walk around. Very picturesque, especially during summer months. Hard to believe that it is a plot of land in middle of a built up area with busy roads and a hospital just a stones throw away."
66,Greenness galore!,"We went to watch the snooker in may last year and whilst we were waiting for the evening session,  we visited botanical gardens and were not disappointed was a beautiful garden to see 😃"
67,A Cool Haven,This is a nice day out toGo with friends or family. There sculptures of peter pan and a bear definitely worth taking pictures of. There are a variety of flowers to look st too.
68,Beautiful,"Love coming here, always such a lovely atmosphere and in summer really nice environment to hang out for a picnic or a walk."
69,A Sunday morning stroll,"Had a lovely walk around the gardens whilst my daughter went for uni interview. Lovely place, tranquil and worth a visit"
70,Visited for the Annual Music in the Gardens Concert,Great walk through her and lots to see and learn from in the gardens. Particularly like the prairie planting area and found myself meandering through that section for a while!
71,Lovely oasis in the city,The whole family love a stroll around the botanical gardens. It is a great space hidden in the our great city. There are beautiful flowers and plants all year round to admire. There is a great little cafe too where you can grab some refreshments.
72,Well tendered attractive park,"We really enjoyed our stroll around these well maintained gardens. There was plenty of colour in the flower beds and the collection of mature trees is excellent. The labelling of trees and plants is very useful, and we particularly enjoyed seeing the Giant Redwood and Coast Redwood trees. The greenhouses and the rock/water gardens were also very impressive. There is so much to see here."
73,Relaxing walk in beautiful gardens,Really enjoyed our visit to the botanical gardens the day was lovely and warm so we had a really good look round well recommended
74,Beautiful Place,"The gardens are recommended for people of all ages, the cafe is nice and so is everything else. The pavillions and bear pit are good places to check out."
75,Pleasant place to spend an hour or two,Great walking. plenty to see plants and flowers from all over the world and extremely interesting.Great Cafe at the Gardens offering top quality liquid and food refreshment with plenty of outside seating on a sunny day.Good morning or afternoon out
76,"Really pleasant, well looked after","Nice gardens to have a walk through, not as much there as expected and we walked round a few times and couldn’t find the ponds."
77,Vacation,We have come here for Illuminate the Gardens for the past 2 years. It's always a lovely night. Plenty of food stalls and amazing fireworks. Can be hard to park though.
78,Lovely Oasis in the middle of a busy area,Great for all ages. Plenty of space for picnics in the summer. Squirrels everywhere. The is a 'secret' bear that my little one loves to find. Often they have events and plant sales.
79,tidy park with a nice cafe,"Love this place, the Victorian glass houses are amazing, the plants are wonderful what ever time of year you go, with lovely odours of different plants as you pass by, there is also a great coffee shop where you can get drinks and a light meal/sandwiches etc, I try to visit when ever I am in Sheffield. Careful not to rustle a paper bag, hundreds of hungry squirrels come running"
80,Not much to do ,"The botanical gardens really are a beautiful part of sheffield. I would definitely recommend visiting in the late spring and summer since the blooming flowers are gorgeous. I've been many times for picnics, just walking through or just somewhere to hang out on a hot summer evening."
81,Nice gardens,The Botanical Gardens look amazing all the year round. The colours vary from season to season but always looked well cared for. The glasshouses are also well worth a visit showing you plants etc from all over the world. Plus they have a very nice cafe serving tasty lunches and snacks. Well worth a visit.
82,Calm Oasis,We have been a few times to the botanical gardens and we think it's great.  It's free to take a walk around and the glasshouse is brilliant for tropical and dessert type plants (great for people with a succulent/cacti obesession).
83,Where are all the flowers,"nice place to take a stroll and look at what they have to offer in the botanical section also the grounds of the park great for family picnics and socialising, great little cafe for that coffe and sandwich"
84,Too small,"What beautifully managed and maintained gardens! A perfect joy.So much to see, and one can walk briefly or more extensively.An absolute oasis of calm and relaxation."
85,Walking,I really like going during summer time as it is very well mantained. The indoor garden is nothing much though.
86,Beautiful Spot,There isnt actually much to do here but it is nice to come and look around in the summer months as part of a day out then make your way to encliffe park for a ice cream
87,Fabulous gardens,"Lovely place for a walk or a sit down, the indoor gardens are gorgeous and have lots of lovely plants if you're a plant enthusiast."
88,Fantastic haven of peace,"Loved exploring this botanical garden during a hot day. When I arrived at around lunch time most facilities were unfortunately closed, we thought the only cafe on site would serve food but their kitchen was down for maintenance which was quite frustrating because we had to go out of the gardens and go to the KFC across the street then come back.  We went into green house section and that was good but most plants were either dead or so over grown that you had no choice but to stand on them just to get through and see all the planets. However, seeing all the different variations of plants from all around the world was fantastic to see and was highly impressive. There was so much to see during the day, the bear cage was really intriguing and glad it was kind of hidden away and a secret so when I came across it, it was amazing to see.  Highly recommend this place for photographers but definitely recommend you bring your own food if you plan to have lunch here."
89,Peaceful,"We loved this little botanical gardens, always something to see, nice cafe. Not too big so easy to walk round and feel at home."
90,Lovely City Views,"Have a good look round the place & if you can Go to the Art in the Gardens when Artists show off their work. Also, Music in the Gardens, Last year featured The Proclaimers & this year 10cc al in the open air. Cant wait for next year!"
91,Lovely Sunday afternoon stroll,We enjoyed walking round the lovely gardens and having a picnic. Would be nice to return in June or July to see the rose gardens in full bloom.
92,Gorgeous!! ,"My young son loves going here on a sunny day. The green house at the top of the park is a great place to learn about plants from different countries. The squirrels are very friendly and will take nuts out you hands. I’ve never been to the cafe but the ice cream van is always a winner. The park does hold events throughout the year, I’ve never been but I’m sure they will be popular. The park does have some toilets in a mobile container which are always welcome in large parks. This is a great garden in the dry with lots of places to sit and relax with a picnic"
93,Super place to meander for a few hours,I love the beautiful and exotic looking flowers here ! Thumbs up to my home town. So beautiful. And perfect for a date in my oppinion
94,fab!!!!,"My go to place for a bit of fresh air, beautiful during spring and summer, the cafe is hit and miss but ice-cream van is always fab!"
95,Wonderful gardens,Spontaneous visit since it's not too far from York. Really loved the place on a sunny day at least. Hoping to go back again soon this summer with my picnic gear this time.
96,Lovely place to visit,"What a gloriously relaxing place to walk around. Beautiful flowers and flower beds  , lovely atmosphere and all within a stone throw of Eccy Road"
97,A real hidden gem.,"This garden is well stocked and has glorious restored glass houses which have a selection of exotics. The plants outside are labelled and there are many ideas for different styles of garden. Such as dry garden, shady garden, wide borders, and rose garden. Regular plant sales and various workshops ect."
98,Couldn't believe it was free to enter.,A beautiful place to wander around even in Winter. The cafe offers a good range of cakes and coffees. Friendly service.
99,Nice day out,A stunning park right next to University of Sheffield. We love the glass house from the outside it looks regal and Victorian but inside the planting feels modern and the fragrance is wonderful.
100,Beautiful place,"Very nice gardens, there's also often guest events such as the Royal Cacti Society at the gardens which make for an interesting Saturday afternoon."
101,Beautiful flowers,"This is a lovely space, and a great location for an open air play! The play was done centrally with too areas of seating either side - it was the Railway Children and the stage was basically the platform - very original and a brilliant production in a unique setting. We took a picnic which completed the occasion. Will definitely make the journey up again!"
102,"Relaxing, beautiful gardens",These gardens are very much like a park. There is not so much information on the plants. It is very relaxing strolling along the paths with good vistas. The cream tea at the cafe is excellent.
103,Ok but,Beautiful huge gardens full of colour and amazing landscape. Recommended to everyone for a day of relaxation outdoors
104,Lovely walk in the sunny weather,Very well maintained gardens with some national collecion plants.  Nice hot house with a few tropical plants.  Very modern toilets.  Plays hose to different events.  There were signs of a theatre in the park production while I was there and also morris dancers.  Bit of a gem.
105,Wonderful ,Spent an hour wandering round and enjoying the piece and quiet while admiring the flowering plants. It’s not Kew but it was relaxing and clean.
106,Lovely in spring sun,"Lovely long walk through brilliant gardens.Lots of interesting plants and flowers,,really refreshing and a pleasure to visit at anytime of the year :)"
107,Gardens,We visit the Botanical  Gardens all year round as there is always something  new of interstitial.  This time of year it's the grasses and in the spring it's rhododendrons azaleas  and magnolias.  The pond holds interest with the tadpoles that turn into frogs! We always visit the cafe which has the sun in the morning to have coffee outside.
108,Crocus,"Wonderful park area to walk through.  Water features,  benches, trees and flowers. Sitting there in good weather any time of year is sheer tranquillity.  Any gardener will be sent into ecstasy with all the wonderful flowers and shrubs."
109,Lovely leg stretch and cake !,This is a great place to spend a little time in a great part of the city.  Combine the gardens with a meal in one of the excellent restaurants at Hunters bar.
110,great for a morning out.,"This place is good to visit all year round as it's always full of trees, plants and squirrels. It's also free of charge to visit unless there is paid event running."
111,beautiful,Love a wonder around the botanical gardens and the bear pit - kids fave bit. Nice cafe but can be really busy so tend to walk through the gardens down on to eccelsall road for food. Plenty of benches but I like to sit on the grass under one of the many old beautiful trees and watch the friendly squirrels
112,Happy place,An oasis of beautifully laid out gardens that are full of colour for most of the year. The flower beds are always gorgeous and the planting out down the various paths always have something to offer all year round. The newly restored green houses with their different plants and flowers from around the world are always worth a wander round. Lots of grass for picnics and to just sit and enjoy what is a gem in the heart of a very busy city.
113,Lovely space,"Lovely gardens , lots of squirrels and birds . Glasshouses  are renovated  and offer plants from different regions. Nice cafe and ice cream van but no parking !!!!!"
114,Always worth a visit on a nice day. An Oasis of calm amidst a busy city.,Really nice place to visit with free entry. Always go here alone as it’s such a quiet place to think. Great variety of plants to look at and a huge space to walk around
115,Great wandering through the gardens,The botanics are a beautiful place to go and sit quietly to read or take the kids for a picnic. Well worth a visit
116,Pleasant stroll with friends,"Well in my opinion the park is good, but only for those who want to relax and enjoy the nature. There are a lot of banks and places were you can sit and children love the squirrels."
117,Wonderful!,Love the botanical gardens! Great space hidden in the city! Beautiful flowers and plants all year round! Hundreds or friendly squirrels to feed and meet! The bear pits always great to find there and the cafe is lovely up top too
118,Beautiful,Great place so beautiful and peaceful! Great for a day out. Lovely new experience. Dog friendly.....
119,Lovely flowers at the moment ,"Love this place. Lucky enough to work next door. Beautiful, particularly in summer. Ideal to go and enjoy ice cream in the sunshine. You’d never know you’rw in the middle of a city!"
120,Brilliant,Actually had after wedding photos taken in and around gardens. Had never been before. Taking kids there soon.
121,Peaceful,Great park full of colour and a host for music and arts festival through the year. Great venue for weddings.
122,Our 1st visit with our 3 month old,I have lived in Sheffield all my life and we are so lucky to have parks and places like this and are kept so well. Whether you are out walking the dogs or taking the Grandkids out it is such a relaxing place to be !!!
123,Beautiful place,"A lovely place to wander around on a cold February morning. Well maintained, good information posts. i liked the glass house. Also public toilets available.Lots of variety of plants and tress. Will be happy to return."
124,Great place for a walk,I had a coffee at the coffee shop with friends and we walked round the beautiful gardens. Well worth a visit.
125,Explore ,"We had a very enjoyable day out with the grand kids,the park is bigger than I thought with quite a few different areas and the glass house. Squirrels were cute"
126,Hidden gems,Came yesterday had a lovely wander round now I don’t know much about flowers but I remember years ago coming here and it was awash with flowers yesterday all the flower beds at top near green house were empty! No colour and the earns empty cafe very nice cafe toilets a disgrace unfortunately
127,Great for plant lovers. ,"Nice area for a steady walk around.Unfortunately not the best kept but this is run by the shocking Sheffield Council Sonia to be expected, butbis a nice walk."
128,Great am great round ,"We were pleasantly surprised to find this oasis of quiet and excellent display of plants in the heart of the city. The gardens are well tendered and we saw many volunteers tending the beds during our visit. It had an extensive range of plants and trees from around the world, the glass house at the top of the gardens being a must see. Although laid out on a slop, the gradient is easy for wheel chair axis and the few steps can be avoided. Car parking is a bit of a problem as its pay at parking meters in the surrounding streets, which you have to share with local residents, which at times means a can be a bit of a walk."
129,Beautiful place,Wonderful walk through the grounds & a magnificent Glass House with amazing trees & plants to see🤗Everything is so well kept
130,Great place to stroll in relaxed surroundings,"Even during winter without flowers it's a great park. Not far away from the city center, but you can relax and take your time in this lovely area. You can feed squirrels, wander, read... I went a lot in this park."
131,Stunning Nature,"An oasis in the city, beautifully laid out gardens with a delightful mix of planting. A cute palmhouse, which was being used as a wedding venue when we visited. Great cafe too, the scones were excellent."
132,Great place to chill,On staycation in South Yorkshire from Essex for our wedding anniversary week. We were lucky that the sun shone and the day was good. I think this place would be great to visit in all seasons as the trees and plants would look interesting all year round. How lucky are the local people to have such a beautiful place to spend time in. Me and hubby really loved this beautiful place.
133,Botanical gardens,Lovely place for a walk with family and friends.  There is plenty of space to explore and a nice variety of plants to see.  Would love to visit again soon
134,Lovely,"Went on a sunny winter's day. Nice gardens and nice hothouse.Quite small, but worth a visit if you have some time to spare in Sheffield."
135,Great spot,"More a public park with a few nice borders and some notable trees, well kept and lovely open grounds , no worry about social distances as it has plenty of space and wide paths ."
136,walk,"I have visited the gardens several times recently - It is a great place to either wander around or sit on a seat and watch the world go by.. Have a look in the Conservatory and what about something to eat or drink in the cafe,. Very well kept and I recommend a visitEnjoy"
137,Excellent place for people of all ages,The Botanical Gardens is a serene place to walk it’s generally quiet and very rarely crowded.The gardens are beautiful whatever the season and there’s is always something interesting to look at either in the gardens themselves or the vast walk through green houses.It’s beautifully kept and extremely clean.There are plenty of benches dotted around for those that need to sit or those who just like to sit and watch the world go by.
138,Beautiful Garden,"Free entry to this wonderful garden. Delight just to view, but well signed both outside on the beds, and excellent information boards in the glasshouse.Plenty to see architecturally with rock garden, bear pit, fountain and the general setting.It is somewhat hidden away, and though disabled cars can park inside, on road parking nearby is mostly chargeable and difficult.Great location- thank you to Sheffield Council for maintaining this."
139,A gem of a place for a walk and Tranquillity plus next to shops and trendy cafes.,We went here with our young son for a Sunday walk. Although I’ve lived in Sheffield all my life I have never visited the gardens. It was a lovely walk round although the building itself was a bit inaccessible for us with a large pram. The bear pit is a must although it did take us a while to find. Toilet are very nice and clean situated at the bottom end of the gardens. All in all a nice few hours spent and look forward to visiting again.
140,A lovely place for a walk and some fresh air,"What a stunning place to visit, we visited on a glorious summer's day having had s cocktail in city centre, a relaxing stroll round the park and its different areas with friends was idyllic. The greenhouse is worth a visit though very hot as houses the most wonderful tropical plants and is very well kept and maintained. Perfect city retreat."
141,Tranquillity ,"We had seen good reviews and having found the gardens had to search around the side streets to find somewhere to park. Fortunately, we found somewhere that was not covered by residents parking and  paid areas.  However, it was worth the effort as we spend 2 thoroughly enjoyable hours.  The refreshments are limited as are the toilet facilities but with planning that should not be a problem mainly caused by current restrictions."
142,A Delight,"Lovely varied gardens, not too big.  Interesting bear pit on one side.  Nice to see a different part of the city."
143,Worth a visit,"I was expect something better. The Botanical garden is too small, looks like normal park.You can go for walk there ."
144,"For the gardener, a quiet stroll or the whole family.","The Botanical Gardens have a wonderful display of flowers and trees, with a calm, warm atmosphere. There is a greenhouse you can go inside with plants from all around the world and information with each, which was highly entertaining. There is no cost to enter, and dogs are allowed if on a lead. The gardens are well-kept and diverse, with plenty of places to sit, read and relax."
145,Neat layout ,Had the pleasure of attending my nieces wedding in July. The wedding ceremony took place in the actual greenhouse and the guests all watched from outside. The atmosphere was brilliant and I would recommend this great venue all day long if you were considering it for a wedding. The wedding breakfast was served in the greenhouses and although not much space worked really well. We were allowed to bring our own alcohol to drink after the service and eating and drinking in the fantastic surrounding of the botanical gardens made for a fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable wedding.
146,Beautiful place to walk,"Lovely space just out of the city centre. Beautiful selection of trees and plants, with an adorable pond and enough different spaces to let you lose yourself. Best not to swarm down there right now, but I really recommend paying a visit sometime. Something to look forward to once this is all over! Something for all the family."
147,DAY OUT,"Would recommend this if you have an hour or two to walk around. There were some very pretty planting displays, and various areas all planted differently with shrubs  or trees. And all this for free."
148,Winding down.,I have been visiting the botanical gardens since my days as a student over 40 years ago. There is always something of interest here no matter what time of the year that you visit. From the bear pit to the statue of Peter Pan the plants to the squirrels there is something for everyone. A blissful oasis in Sheffield. You can also take your books and study.
149,On the tourist trail,"We stopped at the gardens as we were in the area, there was plenty to explore, and it will be lovely to go back when there are different flowers out. We took a buggy and there were plenty of suitable paths to use but very little signage about saying wjat ways to go. It would have also been nice to have informational areas as i had to go home and Google the history of the bear pit and glass houses, would have been nicer to have known about the history there and then."
150,Family outing,"A friend suggested we meet at the Botanical Gardens for a coffee.  On a nice day it is a perfect spot to spend a bit of time. City and river views, beautiful war memorials, lovely gardens and a good cafe right in the city."
151,Always so beautiful,Wonderful example of botanical gardens with not only superb glasshouse but well tended external gardens where the flowers look superb at all times of the year.  Only downsides are that the pigeons and grey squirrels need culling and preferably xterminating.
152,"Nice gardens, very little there","Great day out, but get there early. Not only does it get busy getting in, the place is huge. Lots to look at and some quirky works of art too. Recommend for adults and children alike."
153,Beautiful,"I always visit the gardens for the freedom it gives alongside the nearby Endcliffe Park.However, now they hold occasional music concerts like the 10CC one this year that I attended, I will visit more often."
154,Autumn colours,"During a home exchange visit from Newcastle upon Tyne, the weather was being freakishly warm. The gardens were not only beautifully laid out with a huge variety of plants and trees but there were several areas which afforded a comfortingly cool place to linger.There are lots of benches scattered about so you are never too far away from a decent rest. The only slight niggle I had with the place was the café. We ordered two afogatos, espresso coffee poured over a scoop of ice cream. At just under £8 I proffered my trusty contactless debit card only for the assistant to say no, got to be over £10 to use one. No ‘sorry for the inconvenience’ was offered. I’m but a humble punter but I thought contactless cards were intended for small amounts - obviously not in this Sheffield business.It was just as well the rest of the gardens shone through. If we return to Sheffield in the future this is one place we would return."
155,Beautiful,"Beautiful gardens, well kept, but I think I enjoyed Weston Gardens just the same: part of the glass house was closed for a wedding.  Nice tea room."
156,Beautiful ,"No matter what time of year you go this place is always stunning. Been a biology student in the city for just over two years now and have spent days in the Botanical Gardens.I'm currently carrying out a level 3 project and the Garden's staff are being very very helpful and supportive in this.As a photographer, there are no places inside the city that is rather be! And the very very inquisitive squirrels (stand still for a while and one'll jump on your leg! Overall a fantastic place for a day out as friends, family, or even alone for some peace. In summer, the Gardens are unmissable!"
157,Autumn colours,Although these gardens are in the center of Sheffield its a quiet and peaceful place to visit especially in summer or to visit the glass house which exotic plants or  bistro café in the evening which is a little pricy but great food
158,Great calm place,A very beautiful garden ranging with all different types of flowers. Also has a lot of space for friends and family to have a picnic or hang out.
159,Delightful well stocked Botanical Garden,Lovely location and a perfect day for a picnic and some cycling.With the soft grass and gentle slop this was the perfect place for my daughter to master her bike followed by some sandwiches and an ice cream
160,Coffee out with friends,"I lovely and calm place to visit, surrounded by variates of trees, kids can learn a lot from the planted trees.. Very educational ..It has a caffe in the corner with excellent staff, very friendly and welcoming.."
161,I love the Botanical Gardens!,"Beautiful walk in the gardens today The glass houses are lovely and we visited the bear pit, love the statue of the bear"
162,Simply Stunning,"Came here with a friend to see the sights of the gardens after it had been converted for the fireworks display. Everything was really pretty, and the food was amazinggg."
163,Cute! ,The Botanical Gardens are beautiful Victorian grounds and Pavillions. The Curators Tea Room/Cafe is great also.
164,Plenty to see and do here,"A huge garden at the centre of Sheffield, divided into areas of various themes. It is spacious, a perfect place to walk around relaxing or sit under a tree listening to voices of nature. The glasshouse contains a good collection of plants from different corners of the world. A wonderful place to spend a few hours."
165,Green little paradise,"We had bought a Children’s book called ‘The Little Urban Fox Visits The Botanical Gardens’ so decided to visit and follow the map and story in the book. The children were so excited to find all the places the fox went and we all learnt so much history about the gardens. It is well worth a visit to see the pavilions, bear pit, dinosaur footprints, fossilised tree, Pan, Anthea the ant and so much more! Great cafe with toilets both at top and bottom of park. Wonderful place for a a picnic."
166,Very relaxing and good cafe,"Took our own picnic and found a lovely quiet spot for our lunch, then further explorations. Spent most of the day here."
167,An old friend,"A lovely winter's day walk in the sunshine through the gardens to the curators bistro which was also lovely, food, service, couldn't fault it."
168,Walk Through Botanical Gardens,"Lots to see including rare and exotic plants, well worth the trip, even on a winters day there is plenty of heated room provided."
169,"Botanical Gardens, Sheffield",Just popped in to find a particular plant to see if the one growing in our garden is the same. Glorious autumnal colours- spend 10 minutes or a day !
170,1st visit,A very well thought out area near the heart of Sheffield. There are some magnificent trees complementing the recently restored covered tropical plants building.
171,Lovely gardens,"If nice gardens are your thing then this Sheffield icon is the thing for you, a large park with lots of flowers, worth a visit especially in the Spring and Summer."
172,Really nice park,"Lovely place to walk around and enjoy the plants, trees, glasshouses and have a nice coffee and cake in the cafe"
173,Beautiful Garden,Lovely gardens with plenty of places to sit and relax on a sunny afternoon. Will definitely be back!
174,Beautiful afternoon,We have been visiting these gardens for the last 11 years and I think that they are truly amazing. I have never seen anything quite like them it is absolutely breathtaking. The condition that the grounds are kept in are outstanding.I love this place so much that my now husband decided to use this amazing place to propose. It will always hold this dear place in my heart.I would highly Recommend a visit.
175,Beautiful jewel in the crown in Sheffield,"Beautiful gardens all year round, always something in bloom. The Magnolias and Camellias in spring are magnificent, and have to be seen to be believed! All year round there are concerts/art shows etc, but the gardens are always open. The wild squirrels are happy to take nuts from your hands too, which is a lovely experience.Plenty of room for children to run around on the extensive lawns, space for ball games too!"
176,Anniversary meal,"Have a nice time, just strolling an chatting , I thought it was very clean and would definitely return."
177,Definitely a must see if you appreciate nature!,"I had a couple of hours spare when on business in Sheffield, and visited the Botanical Gardens. What a lovely peaceful and most interesting place! A haven of tranquility and beauty, proper northern municipal splendour, with a magnificently restored glass house. Free entry and really worth seeing. I guess parking may be a bit of an issue, but an excellent website should help you out. Nice cafe too!"
178,Words cannot describe how breathtaking.,"With nice weather, the Botanical Garden is a great place to relax and have a walk. You can see plenty of plants inside the ""house"" and it's worth it!"
179,What a lovely place for an open air play!,"Pretty gardens, but the place to be in Sheffield if you want to meet snotty locals. Sheff is usually  friendly but the older people in these gardens are often rude and unpleasant. Esp if you have a dog."
180,Oasis,"Whenever you go to the Botanical gardens there is something new to enjoy. In this case on a sunny February day the spring flowers were fabulous. Nice space to relax, with cafe in the grounds. Lovely"
181,Great place to relax,"An amazing warm sunny day was made perfect by a stroll around the gardens. A wonderful coffee shop with super friendly staff, followed by a stroll through the greenhouses made a perfect Sunday afternoon"
182,Always a great evening for music in the gardens ,"When we first moved to Sheffield in 1980, the hothouses were very run down and the gardens pretty mundane.  But thanks to some Millennium funding (I believe in part from the National Lottery), the hothouses were restored and the whole site made much more interesting.  There is also a cafe/restaurant there and between April and June, you are likely to see many young people on the grass deep in their books, studying for their exams.  It's an excellent place to  bring children of all ages."
183,Lovely grounds wroth a visit,"Lovely sunny day, everybody sun bathing, picnicking.Gardens in gorgeous condition, beautiful place to visit if your in Sheffield,and it's free, a must."
184,Little oasis of green belt in the midst of the city,Lovely visit to these gardens.  Easy to walk from city centre.  Not big gardens but very peaceful with a good ambiance.  Bonus was lovely cafe in the gardens.  Strange that no mention of this cafe on the website.
185,Beautiful,"Just walked up through the Botanical Gardens after having a coffee on Sharrow Vale. On a mild December morning it is a great place to stroll, relax and talk or just take in the lovely surrounding. Whatever the weather or time of the year it is a lovely place."
186,Great venue for a wedding,"A (rather hilly in parts!) oasis near the centre of the city.Just walked through on a brief visit and really liked it, can't wait to go back and see more."
187,An oasis a city.,Worth a visit any time of year as the gardens are constantly changed to suit the seasons of the year. There are plenty of seats and lots of quiet areas should you want a bit of reflective space.
188,Learned to ride,"Beautiful and relaxing environment for a walk around the gardens, or simply sit and relax! Coffee shop on site too!"
189,Lovely lunch,Being local to town and Brocco bank but just as local to the Botanical gardens i am very lucky to enjoy a walk in the surrounding area particularly the wonderful Botanical gardens which is always full of people just having fun and enjoying their well kept naturalistic surroundings.why not walk from one end of the gardens to the other?or just pop inside and sit on a bench admiring the view and simply getting close to nature in all it's beauty and splendour!!if you feel like a stroll for some cleaner air amidst the  trees and plants and foliage come on along and enjoy your visit?!I'm sure you'll be back again before you know it😉🌻💐⚘
190,lovely green space,A historical garden with plenty of space for families to socialise. Rare plants on show in the greenhouses & a look into the past
191,Love this place,A peaceful park just out from the city centre. There are some well maintained greenhouses with specimens from different continents. The cafe had a good range of food and drink. A perfect place to visit when you need some fresh air and want to see some beautiful plants.
192,Beautiful grounds,"Had a lovely coffee at the tea rooms, followed by a walk around the botanical gardens - beautiful large park with a glass house for more tropical plants and trees. Perfect time to visit as all the begonias were still in bloom and the park looked lovely. There was on street parking nearby, some of it with pay meters"
193,Lovely gardens and interesting history,Garden ok. Hot house bit dissappointing - maybe time of year but lot of plants looked less than prime.Made mistake of ordering food. Food ok but under-staffed so took 30 mins for a small coffee and tea and another 20 for food to arrive. Not sure why we waited - used half our £1:40 on road parking fee waiting. Guess we kept thinking it can't possibly be much longer - it was.
194,beautiful,"Visited with husband and daughter (7). Pleasurable afternoon, had a nice walk, enjoy the flowers and wildlife, daughter had lots of fun exploring. Overall a very nice afternoon."
195,Fantastic gem,"I wasn’t sure what I’d find since it’s now fall. I walked all the trails around the many garden areas and was quite impressed. The flowers were mostly gone, some of the trees had various berries. It was interesting seeing all the gardens from Asian, Mediterranean and wondering how they care for those particular plants/trees in the England climate! I also saw some interesting birds on my walk. They have a cafe though I didn’t go there. There are several entrances and many locals use it to walk through or run. I thought it was intriguing enough that I’d love to go back in spring/summer. They have a large greenhouse with exotic plants though the doors were locked."
196,Lovley,"What a lovely surprise to find this beautiful garden in the heart of Sheffield, Wonderfully maintained gardens full of flowering perfumed shrubs, trees and herbaceous perennials, spring bulbs, snowdrops, primroses, hellebores,Iris, daffodils all in flower on the 2nd of Feb. The glass house held plants from other continents all well cared for. I true delight in Feb and well worth a visit if you love gardens. Squirrels and birds abound so lovely to see in the centre of a busy city."
197,Lovely,"Beautiful park just off Ecclesall Road. Great for strolling along during the day with a good cafe within the grounds. Usually visit for the festival of Music in the Gardens, complete with deckchair, picnic and drinks. Always popular even when not the best weather. Great atmosphere."
198,Day out with the kids,With its magnificent glasshouse and wonderful gardens a great place to visit. After a morning stroll make time for a coffee in the local cafe. On a sunny day treat yourself to an ice cream and just sit on one of the many benches around the gardens.
199,A must see place,Nice to wander while snowdrops and crocuses at their best. Nice garden with orangery and tropical plants-today used for a wedding-and s pleasant cafe to sit outside in the sun!
200,Beautifully restored Victorian gardens,"We visit here all year round. I came here before i had kids to chill out. I have then taken the kids from birth to enjoy the gardens. Young children love finding the 'secret' places and toddlers love to play on the grass. Not to mention the ""Bear Pit"" Take some nuts and feed the squirrels, they eat from the palm. (hours of fun).Then after exploring the gardens head down hill onto Eccleshall Road where there are trendy cafes, shops like whitestuff and futon. or a divine choclate shop that sells liquid choclate drinks. There is something for everyone in this area which provides entertainment even on a low budget.This is a hidden gem of sheffield which will not disappoint."
201,Great for gardening fans & family,"This is one of my favourite places in Sheffield. Beautiful and incredibly well maintained gardens, free to access and dog friendly."
202,Haven in the city,"Tucked away between the hospital and the shopping square . This green oasis of conservation offers a lovely place to have a picnic and a leg stretch. It's a little hilly, so be prepared to work for your tea and 🍰. Squirrels jump from tree to tree. Plants are marked for the botanically minded. Paths are tarmacked for easy travel, but have an uphill theme.Great piece of greenery and glasshouses for education and peace. Lovely place to eat your sandwiches on a bench and watch the world and nature pass you by. The toilets aren't brilliant, but , importantly ...they are there ! Worth a visit. Not posh like London or Glasgow but nice and relaxing."
203,"Beautiful, well kept gardens - well worth a visit","I live very near the Botanical Gardens and they have been my garden for many many years. They have seen my children grown and one of them had his wedding photoshoot at the Gardens. It is a wonderfully kept place, in spite of the many cuts, as the people working there are not only knowledgeable but also dedicated. A place to cherish."
204,A splash of colour in the city,The gardens are on a hillside so be prepared for a little up hill walking.  The glasshouse was restored in 2003 and is worth a look.  The gardens are open in daylight hours.  In winter they are not at their best but still a nice place to take guests staying in Sheffield.
205,Interesting Gardens ,My favourite place to visit in Sheffield. Beautiful in the summer and the steep slopes make for a decent days walk.
206,Pleasurable afternoon,Nice place to spend a couple of hours in spring flowers. The fact that you can't park inside needs to better advertised by a big sign on the gate!
207,Potentially beautiful rather run-down establishment,"A place to visit at different times of the year to witness the seasonal changes of the garden. Can be dependent on the weather though. There is a cafe on site for refreshments and shelter. Gardens are well kept, and nice for a peaceful walk."
208,Lovely garden but some tlc needed,"it's great that Sheffield's botanical gardens are free to enter; a lovely green space for strolling or sitting, great variety of planting and trees, lots to look at and learn about"
209,Lovely space,"On a sunny day you will not find a better place. Chilled out, relaxed, visually pleasing. Fantastic plant life. A must visit for those fond of a walk. Cool vibes."
210,Refreshing,Having been less than impressed with Sheffield last autumn it was refreshing to explore the local parks and gardens this weekend and find a free green and tranquil side to the City. We really enjoyed wandering around the roses and sunken garden and discovering hidden places like the bear pit. The hot house could have been much better looked after and sadly there were some dead and diseased plants which spoit the overall experience. The surrounding roads were tranquil and leafy and I hope the chain saws stay well away!
211,Brilliant free venue,"Used to go to school (King Edwards) near here. It was a little impoverished in the 60s but has enjoyed a number of revamps and improvements, particularly to the greenhouses and conservatories. If you are a visitor to Sheffield and fancy visiting the great shopping experience of Ecclesall Road, consider parking on Clarkehouse Road and walking down through the botanical gardens. For a start you will be able to park and for seconds you will enjoy a delightful public garden."
212,Lovely place,"A wonderfully set out garden with lots of pockets of calm and delight. Beautifully restored glass houses, cafe, rock pools and don't miss the tucked away bear pit. Always something to see."
213,Beautiful- can't wait to explore more,"Beautiful park, lovely setting, nice to amble around then do a bit of shopping down Eccy Rd or a pint or two in the Franny Newton"
214,Small but great,"Went here to chill & eat my dinner great place to be. Vast amount of 💐 and other exotic plants. Came away with loads of beautiful pictures. Great at any time, But in summer its simply stunning."
215,Vibey Gardens ,Great place to visit when it’s dry. Really good place to take for visiting parents. the bear pit is well worth finding too!
216,Tranquil haven,Love this space.Always a pleasure to wonder around these gardens.Somewhere to escape and picnic... or just sit.
217,Beautiful park,"gorgeous gardens top in uk. top in the world incredible grounds!!! must see in all seasons,all months...highlight of sheffield"
218,Looking better than ever.,A gorgeous place to visit that is only a short walk from the city centre. There are lots of different things to see and learn about. It's a great place for spending time with your thoughts or taking the whole family for a visit. The cafe was also really welcomed and the food and drink was tasty and reasonably priced.
219,The perfect hidden gem in a bustling city,"Great day out. Nice place to just take a walk or spend time with the kids. There are lots of plants from all over the world. I did not try the cafe, but they do have one."
220,Excellent garden,"A lovely organised garden to visit at any time of year. Beautifully laid out plantations and very fine glass house. Adequate cafe, helpful staff. Occasionally, in the summer, plays are put on en plein aire - these are fun, and an opportunity for a picnic too. Art in the Gardens is an annual event for art lovers of all ages in the autumn - always popular. A little work to produce a garden app/education tool to explain the Botany would not come amiss."
221,A Lovely place to stroll through,"Driving out of Sheffield to Castleton, stopped by the Botanical Gardens on the western side of the city to admire the pretty landscaped gardens and interesting greenhouses with their tropical plants.Free to visit.Small café and toilets on-site.Parking is a bit of an issue, but found a pay and display space on a nearby residential road."
222,Lovely afternoon,nothing particularly exciting to see there but a spot of quiet greenery almost no distance from the city centerthe old paviliions seem well maintained..  not much information available about any of it or its history..  most people would miss the old bear pit.Sometimes thay have the odd event on..  Art in the gardens and Music inthe grdens to name but two.  Both have the cheek to charge entry to a public park.   Music in the Gardens is ridiculously expensive for a typical family of four its between £60 and £90..   about £250  a general music niht with an eorchestra one night and has beens on the others if you attended all 3 nights for what should be free entry. Art in the Gardens... a complete rip off £6:00 per adult though accompanied kids are free but no unaccompamied children allowed.  Again its a disgrace ....this is a public park and exhibitors are there to sell their work.  So I can see why they get charged.  Public entry ought to be free with perhaps the ability provided to voluntarily contribute to a few of the lesser known charities from Sheffield.They also forget that for some full time residents and students  this is their local park and they have to pay to go in.  Suitable for anyone although there is not much in either of these events to capture the imagination of young children
223,Stunning Gardens,It good day out for all the family lot's to see and you can take lot's photo's.and will go back see it again and you take some friends with you to show them.take a picnic with you and enjoy your day.
224,Absolutely beautiful ,Lovelly cafe is a good start before walking through glass house. Visit to bear pit for grandchildren is interesting. Good location for scootering too.
225,Beautiful gardens .,"A beautiful botanical garden with a gorgeous restored Victorian hot house, this is a favourite place for our family. Free entry, open til dusk in the summer with outdoor events year round."
226,A lovely couple of hours,Free entry is a bog bonus.The leaves are beginning to change colour in the gardens and in a few weeks will be at their peak.Still lots of flowers in the beds and as always the little cafe is well worth a visit. Friendly staff and interesting choices of food.
227,Lovely gardens,A very nice garden in the city..parking could be a problem though...however lots of open areas for kids to play and well maintained lawns makes this place worthwhile to go for a walk or spend the time
228,Pretty landscaped gardens and old greenhouses,"Always worth a visit is the huge botanical gardens. Located near the Hallamshire Hospital, the gardens offer significant history combined with beautiful displays. Check out the birds and other delights in the Victorian buildings along with a leisurely stroll around the well kept pathways. A must see when visiting the city."
229,Very pretty and well presented....,"Very beautiful gardens. Very relaxing. Can spend a full day there easy. Picnic, play games or just go for a walk."
230,Beautiful scene,"A fine example of Victorian arcatecture and gardens, including the old bear pit, empty now of course, but in bygone earers on show to the public with captive bears, these gardens are open free of charge to the public"
231,Walk in the gardens,"Visited here few weeks ago, lovely grounds, was expecting more colour more plants ect but never the less was a lovely hour out! Visited the onsite flower selling place! Had a sale haha! Purchased a plant no idea what it was called was pretty though! All in all good hour out, lovely for kids to run around on the lawns!"
232,A lovely oasis of calm in Sheffield,I haven't been into The Botanical Gardens for a while and so was quite pleased when my Daughter asked me to join her on her morning dog walk.  We thoroughly enjoyed wandering around the lovely gardens on a sunny Spring morning. There were lots of families doing the same thing and the Spring flowers made it even better.  Thoroughly recommended.
233,Lovely little oasis of a garden in Sheffield,"Visited in December,nice park interesting greenhouse,the cafe was open,did not visit.Could not see any on site parking,apart from a disabled car park.Free to go in."
234,Avoid eating here.,"The botanical gardens is a great place to visit there are lots of unusual things to see.  There is the Bear pit where they used to hold bear fights, the statue of Peter Pan and lots  more.  You can feed the squirrels or just have a picnic on a sunny day"
235,Beautiful,"If youre waiting for exam results alone, want a picnic with firends or just a suntan near shops this is the place in Sheffield"
236,A sensual experience of colourful seclusion,"Beautiful, well kept gardens - well worth a visit. Don't forget to visit the bear pit! And the lovely rock garden with the pond. There's lots of great open air theatre and music in the summer"
237,Worth a visit,Great fireworks and lovely garden. Brilliantly organised and was fantastic. Not overpriced or overcrowded and was a fun evening! Thanks
238,Nice Gentle Walk at Botanical Gardens,"A brilliant collection of botanical plants, both outdoor and in the atrium. Plenty of seating and different paths for visiting. Great selection of both free and paid events held here."
239,An oasis,"Massive place to visit, you can go round in circles, there's a bear place there too, ( not real bears) it's fun for family day outs, living in Sheffield I take my young grandchildren there, each time they go they have fun trying to remember which way the bear circle is."
240,older couple,It was a grey rainy day and after struggling to park on the road outside we dived in to the huge green house to shelter. Pleasant place with plants divided into countries. Nice park with fantastic display of crocii. Little shop at the entrance and a cafe. Would be nicer on a sunny day but a pleasant stroll with friends.
241,A surprising oasis,A beautiful place to visit and picnic on warm sunny days. Plenty of flowers and trees to look at with nice peaceful areas. Definitely one for families or friends and the squirrels are very friendly!
242,Passing through Sheffield,We had a couple of hours free while we were in Sheffield before eating at a restaurant so we decided to stroll around this park.It's quite big with plants and bushes and trees from around our planet. Pity is that the Pavillions were shut when we got there but the walk around the Botanical Gardens was inspiring and beautiful.A very pleasant place to wander and disconnect from the outside world
243,Lovely ,They are gardens as well as being botanical. There is very little else you need to know. They offer a peaceful respite from the busy city.
244,Pretty good,"We booked a table at 5pm on  a saturday for 4 people. Was were asked to stand aside to the wall and wait for our table to be cleared, for some reason a group of girls was seen before our group was and they specifically made a ""special exception"" for them as they had booked just for drinks. We said were having food and drinks as we were told ⁰we wasnt allowed to book a table for just drinks and we was spoken down to and treated poorly, we eventually sat down and ordered a few drinks, starters and then desserts, the hanging kebab dessert wasnt available but the service at the table was okay, we had to ask for water at our table and we didnt get offered paper straws for our drinks.The food we ordered came, the tinest bit  of bread came with our platter which was shared between two us, anyone would think there was a bread shortage. Wouldnt recommend the deli board. Olives arnt even pitted, on the bright side the camembert was lovely and the aperol went down a treat. Overall 2 out 5,  for the service of the waitress and the drinks which are always on point. If we was treated fairly from the begining this would have been more positive."
245,Yorkshire gem,Great little restaurant with marvellous glasshouses full of interesting plants. Lots of trees and pleasant lawns with various places to hide away from the streets and crowds. Lots of interesting paths and shrubs.
246,Magical place to visit,"A beautiful oasis of well maintained gardens, exotic plants, calming water features, local wildlife and of course the bear pit.Located in a lovely area of Sheffield the Botanical Gardens are probably best accessed from Ecclesall Rd, if you're looking to spend some relaxing time in peace and quiet, or family time with the kids the Botaical Gardens are a great place to visit, idea for a picnic or afternoon in the Curators House (Cafe).Key an eye out for some great events, Art in the Gardens, Fireworks Night and Music in the Gardens."
247,Relaxing place,"After years of neglect these always popular free gardens have been through a regeneration since the 90's.Trees, lawns, buildings and borders have now passed through the re-building phase.Still has its specialist gardens and events.A lot of wedding photography takes place. The planting and the slopes create here are many different.Although on a slope, its all easy walking, many hard surfaces wheelchair friendly routes. Young children love finding the 'secret' places and toddler love to fall over and roll around.Off Eccleshall Road (many regular buses, restaurants, pubs, shops etc, and disabled parking.Main entrance on Clarkehouse Road-ice cream van and cafeBest entrance is at the top of Brocco Bank with better nearby on street parking which is particularly difficult during term time.Suggest catch 120 bus (every 10m at least) walk from Hallamshire Hospital/Rutland Hotel, Or 51/52 every 5m to Broomhill(6 pubs + restaurants and cafes) and downhill to the top of Brocco Bank.No games, not suitable for unleshed dogs.Take a picnic."
248,Quiet relaxed ,A great walk around to see the spring flowers made even more pleasant by a hot spring day. A place to visit in every season to witness the changes.
249,A Bit of Trudge from Center City,Need to read or relax? THIS IS YOUR PLACE THEN. Botanical gardens is not only full of info but also fresh flowers and trees able to climbed on- great spot for picnics or even a chill family day out xx 😫😘💋
250,Summer picnic,"This free outdoor excursion was easy to get to by bus. Acres and acres of natural beauty gave us a relaxing afternoon. Wonderful to see families with their picnics and people walking their dogs. So much color, so much variety of plant life. The indoor garden had plants from around the world. We loved it."
251,Nice gardens,Well laid out and tended botanical gardens with views of Sheffield .Great for an hour's walk in the morning or a picnic at lunchtimeShame the inside gardens not open in October.
252,Nice summer visit,"This ""trip"" was carried out primarily to kill time between two appointments, but The Botanical Gardens is an ideal place to while away time, but it is also very much more than that.The sheer variety of flora and their complimenting buildings, statues and fountain are a delight to see whatever the season. There are sometimes functions held in the gardens, such as a plays or artwork displays or horticultural shows. It is also a popular place for picnicking or a gentle scenic walk.The plants themselves seem to be very well maintained and the gardens themselves are very tidy. Most of the plants too are clearly labelled. The gardens themselves are divided into ten different sections partly by floral regions, partly by floral eras and partly by plant seasonal preferences but the divisions are not so rigidly defined to make it appear too artificial.Features include a small pond, a bear pit, with an ursine statue, and three hothouses. The hothouses open during the summer months but not until 11a.m.There is also a cafe at the top end of the gardens.The Botanical Gardens is a place that is simultaneously wildlife friendly and very welcoming to humankind, one of the city's treasures to enjoy whether just passing through or or having the luxury of lingering longer."
253,Beautiful.,Good paths but very hillyParticularly from the disabled car parkNot recommended to push a wheelchair !!
254,Lovely gardens even in Winter,"The Music in the Gardens event has been going on for about 10 years.   It is organised by the Rotary Club as a fund Raising event for local Charities and is an outdoor concert held over 3 or 4 nights in July each year.   It is a beautiful setting and you can take your own chairs, picnic, drinks etc or buy refreshments when there.  This year we went to the Sunday event which is Classical featuring the Unite Brass Band and Sheffield Philharmonic Orchestra with music from the films.  The evening finished with some music from ""Last Night at the Proms"" followed by a fantastic firework display.  Fabulous event which will hopefully continue for many more years."
255,Lovely little place,"Admittedly it was a gorgeous sunny day but this place is breathtaking.  Well worth a good couple of hours.  The plants and trees are well maintained and truly beautiful.  The  fountain is lovely and the ponds were amazing, the fish caught me by surprise as I was sat in the sun!  Plenty of room for the kids to run around and explore with areas of shade as well as bright open spaces.  Looks forward to visiting again in a different season to see how things change.  A beautiful space in the city.  Obviously used by the community, there was a yoga class being held outside and a wedding taking place."
256,"What a relaxing, lovely place!","An all round lovely place to explore from going in the green house to the bear pit. Looking at the peter pan statue and enjoying picnics and tea. Something for everyone, a good place to spend some time."
257,Relaxing,"Perhaps it's the wrong time of year but was a little bit underwhelmed. The cafe/restaurant was totally chaotic. One set of toilets closed and the other toilets were a disgrace. The hot house wasn't particularly impressive, seemed to have alot of dieing plants in. Would've liked to see some sculpture or art in the grounds to draw the eye during winter."
258,What a lovely place,I didn't know this place existed until I saw it on Tripadvisor. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit which was very much spur of the moment after  going somewhere else. I found it very peaceful and the flowers were lovely. Unfortunately I did not have my camera with me. That was a shame because I saw a beautiful plant I couldn't identify and would have liked to have taken a photo to show my gardening group. we did not visit the cafe as we had already eaten elsewhere. A really nice place to stroll and take in all the different colours of trees and plants.
259,Amazing,"The Botanical gardens in Sheffield are still the City's jewel in the Crown. A joy on the eye around every corner , secret hideaways and surprises. The pavilions have had a face lift and no longer house the aquarium and aviary of my youth ( who remembers the two macaws and piranhas? ) but still a great place with space for everyone to enjoy."
260,Even pleasant of a rainy day,Go! Sit and gaze. Stroll and gaze.....  This garden is a wonderful example of what can be done when experts and the local community work together. At any time of year the garden will engage all your senses. The planting is botanically interesting and a joy to look at.
261,Must visit in the summer,Lovely place to visit in the heart of the city. Just a nice place to stroll. Would recommend for a tranquil getaway for a few minutes or a couple of hours.
262,Peaceful and relaxing,"Buy an ice cream.  Wander through the greenhouses seeing the 'exotic' plants.  Sit on the grass and relax.  Go and feed the squirrels, but be careful they don't bite..."
263,Nice place for a visit,"A peaceful, tranquil space between Eccleshall and Clarkhouse Roads. Take a wander around at any time of year for some peace and tranquillity. At various times it hosts a weekend of 'Music in the Gardens' and a series of outdoor Shakespeare plays. There is a cafe and a horticultural display in the temperature controlled glasshouse with a number of international themes. Outside there's a treasure hunt for the kids (and adults) which includes the infamous bear pit. Something for everyone. If you haven't been, try it."
264,Great for a relaxing afternoon in the sun,"As above, a lovely quiet and beautiful place just on the edge of the busy city, calming and somewhere to go to feel very calm and enjoyable."
265,A beautiful asset for Sheffield,Love to wander round the gardens a peaceful haven like to go throughout the year seeing the changing seasons the colours the wildlife
266,Beautiful year round,My todler really enjoyed running around chasing after squirrels while my older daughter was busy discovering origins of plants and flowers. We had an excellent day and would definitely recommend it for family
267,Relaxing,"It's a beautiful garden on a slope, with views of the south side of the city on the horizon, has many different types of plants in different zones that offer interest all the year around.  There is a pond, glass house, bear pit, small fountain and formal border, a recently refurbished education centre that sometimes holds art exhibitions.   I love to go for walks around this place whenever I can and find something new or different each time."
268,Very calm and beautiful,An absolutely stunning place to go for a walk and depending on how quiet it is there's room for a game of frisby.
269,Great unknown Gem,"Take a refreshing break from the city, in these wonderful, well kept surroundings. A sanctuary away from the fast city life."
270,Pleasant place for a stroll,"Having lived local to Sheffield for 30 years I was amazed that I had missed out on such a lovely spot until I visited.Free to walk around, it was a good spot to spend a couple of hours walking around and local to Eccelsall Road for lunch afterwards. Loved the friendly squirrels too-take some treats to feed them if you visit"
271,Beautiful,"Not only In a sunny day it worths walking in to this beautiful garden but also in a rainy day you can enjoy the garden. Very clean and tidy garden with a large kind of plants,in this time of year there is no flower but you must visit this garden in Spring and Summer. There is a big  beautiful greenhouse that you can visit it for free . Then you can drink a cup of tea or coffee in the small coffee shop in the garden . You can find space for parking your car in Both north and south entrance but it is pay and display."
272,Stunning Gardens,"We had finished checking into the nearby Halifax House Hotel, and wanted somewhere to visit close by during a typical day of rain with flashes of clearing.  We realized that it was only about a 10 minute walk to the gardens, so we set off to this free attraction before it got too dark to see the gardens.  It started to rain harder just as we arrived, but we ducked into the greenhouse, and found it to be interesting and a pleasant diversion.  After touring the greenhouse, we went back out into a slight gray drizzle, and decided not to walk the grounds as the gates closed a dusk, and we would not want to be trapped overnight (probably not a real problem), so we only saw a very small part of the grounds."
273,Bear pit flowers squirrels and fresh air ,"came here on a random Friday morning before heading out into Sheffield for a night out. it was cold, but still a very nice place to spend a couple of hours."
274,Something for Everyone!,"I regularly walk through the Botanical Gardens at all times of the year. I go through the gardens on my way to town or just to Eccleshall Road. They are kept beautifully by a team of gardeners supported by volunteers. The new education centre is a great asset. I like the fact that the gardens are free to everyone. There are weddings, concerts, exhibitions and opportunities for families, couple or individuals to take advantage of a lovely Sheffield asset. And I am lucky enough to go through the gardens on a regular basis."
275,you will have good day out here.,This is off a busy road and a peaceful escape from the city hustle and bustle. It closes at 5 (in September at least) so worth starting early
276,Great for concerts and shows!,"Seen many changes over the years . But still you can still find hidden gems . You may find the parking a bit of a problem . Once you enter you will be thinking wow . Find the bear pit go inside the kids will love it and the older ones as well  find the fossil tree ,the secret garden or there any tad poles . the squirrels are very brave but be care full the don,t know that they should not bite . nice cafe up at the top and the green house thing  up there have some wonderful plants . Go at different time of the year you wont be up set very peaceful place to go"
277,Botany in Perspective,After hustle and bustle of ecclesall road shops and bars this place is a beautiful oasis of calm.  Groundsbto walk around lots of gorgeous plants and places to sit or have picnics. Large greenhouse housing tropical plants and a cosy lovely cafe.
278,Great place to visit ,"Always love a visit to the botanical gardens what's not to love it's looked after so well and such beautiful flowers to see and wonder round lucky to have this on my doorstep.  Its nice for a little stroll if you want to have a think and it can be empty early mornings. Can take dogs as long as on lead, nice for reading and hsving a picnic. Nice little cafe and shop also will always be a little sanctuary for me a place to have a wonder round."
279,Still the Jewel in the Crown,I have been to the gardens more times than I can count over the last four years and there is always something new to see. The gardens are well kept considering that budget constraints they must be under. They hold the National sarcococca collection but you need to look carefully to find it. Sarcococca flower in the winter with a wonderful scent and can brighten even the dullest day. This is a peaceful part of the garden to sit on a nice day with your book or just to sit and watch the world go by.The Victorian glass house has been well restored and it is worth picking up a map of the gardens here if you are going to explore the gardens fully. The history of the gardens is interesting and the bear pit is worth searching out. There is plenty of space for children to play and they love feeding the squirrels who are very tame. This is a garden with something for the whole family.
280,All year round interest,The botanical gardens in the summertime is a perfect place to visit with friends have a few beers chillout and relax.
281,Great Afternoon Out,The cafe doesn’t do card purchases under £10 so beware cashless society people!! The vista though was nice.
282,Oasis,These beautiful and well tended colourful gardens provide a welcome green space to walk through on my way to or from work.
283,Sheffield Botanical Garden,"The Botanical Gardens are a short distance from the city centre by car or public transport. The grand entrance and immaculately restored Victorian glasshouses greet the visitor. Immaculate flower beds...traditional park designs give way to wafting perennial borders. Peter Pan bronze statue in the rose garden gleams reflecting the millions of tiny and not so tiny fingers that have glided over the myriad of creatures depicted. The bear pit delights all ages as do the antics of the cheeky squirrels. A visit to the pond area never fails to intrigue our grandchildren. Altogether a top place.... a Sheffield gem, Ssshh locals don't want it to get too popular...just joking plenty of space,"
284,feeding the squirrelsLovely afternoon with the family ate at the restaurant and fed the squirrels,".My friend and I had been staying in Sheffield for the weekend and had some time to fill before catching our train. As we were staying in University accommodation and walking everywhere, we decided to take a wander into the Botanical Gardens. We really enjoyed strolling around the outdoor area and also inside the tropical plant house. I have very limited knowledge of plants, but liked the way that the gardens have been planned out. At one entrance, there is a sign, which explains how the gardens are divided into areas, which I found really interesting. I particularly liked the Evolutionary Area and the wild flower meadow. There seems to be a shop, which opens at weekends and sells plants in aid of the gardens. I would have bought a plant to take home, had I not been carrying other luggage. The gardens also seem to host theatre and music events. It seems like a lovely setting in a lovely area of Sheffield."
285,The Art in the Garden exhibition,"For the past three decades and more I have lived in close proximity to the Botanical Gardens in Sheffield and used to be a regular visitor.  The ""restoration"" which took place over a decade ago ripped the heart and soul, along with many perfectly healthy trees, out of this once magical place. A proposed cull of the resident grey squirrel population was met with outrage.  Now, my visits are very infrequent.   The rock and water garden has been stripped bare and a truly awful, tacky statue of a bear now stands in the Grade II listed bear pit.Visitors used to be respectful of the Botanical Gardens.  However, on a recent visit I witnessed a number of owners not keeping their dogs on a lead and parents allowing their children to climb trees and race around on bikes. The Botanical Gardens used to be a very special place to visit.  Now, apart from The Curator's House tearoom which is small but pleasant, I would not recommend people go out of their way to visit."
286,An all year round experience,There is plants and trees from all over the world .Its like you travelled around the world in couple of hours
287,Fireworks ,"Perfect place to chill out in the sun with friends, plenty of picturesque little hiding places as well as a stunning greenhouse"
288,Botanical Wonder.,Dropped friend off @ her art class every friday aft 1.30 pm sept to may in the  Dorothy fox Education centre in gardens grounds very friendly
289,Lovely place,"A beautiful tranquil spot to spend a few hours walking round or just sitting and enjoying the peace. The glass houses have interesting plants if a shower should happen, there is also a cafe. Don't forget some nuts for the local residents. ( Squirrels )."
290,Beautiful,1st plus point is the gardens are free.There is payable on street parking at the top and bottoms entrance. There are various trails through the gardens an old bear pit with beat statue if you can find it. At the top end there are some large green houses containing more plants.
291,Exotic looking and beautiful,"Title sums up this inner city gem. A pleasant, balmy October afternoon sitting outside the cafe watching the world go by...cannot be beaten. How lucky we are in Sheffield to have this Victorian inheritance."
292,Peaceful venue,"There was a lot of walking to do, but if you can do it, it is well worth the effort. Don't worry too much as there are plenty of resting places. My only regret is it was too early for the Rose Garden, I bet it is a delight later on."
293,Wonderful,"This is one of the jewels in the crown that is the city of Sheffield. Having stayed or lived for many years in cities including London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Paris, Zurich, Venice, Rome, Madrid, Copenhagen, Stockholm,  Brussells, Amsterdam, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco, Vancouver, Rio de Janeiro, Melbourne, Perth, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and quite a few more, Sheffield wins the crown as being the best place to live (just beating even Vancouver & Melbourne that are very fine)"
294,Superb,Wasted on a parking ticket to discover that the place was closed while a fireworks display was being prepared. For what?
295,"All different activities, My Daughters  Wedding, Art in the Gardens & Music in the Gardens featuring 10cc.","If you are looking for a few moments of peace and quiet in the middle of the city, this is the place to escape to. We were there on a showery March day but there was still plenty to look at. The spring flowers were just starting to bloom and the grounds had taken on an expectant look. Everything was well cared for and it was interesting to note the names of plants from the carefully labelled signs."
296,Pretty even in Fall,"These gardens can be accessed from near The Francis Newton Wetherspoons pub, near The Hallamshire Hospital or from Eccleshall Road. There are plenty of grassed areas for sunbathing or picnics. In summer, the park hosts a series of concerts in beautiful surroundings. There is a proliferation of flower beds and spring/summer brings them out beautifully. Come autumn, the park is lovely hues of rusty browns. The fountain walkway, leads to a large conservatory with plants from around the world, the park and the hothouse are a photographer's paradise with interesting macro close-ups achievable. A nice half-day out with nice eateries near-by, all reasonably priced with beer gardens."
297,Lovely Summer attraction,Great botanic garden with free entry. Some interesting hidden features worth exploring. Explored using Pokemon which gave a whole different perspective.
298,Excellent afternoon with the children,"Sheffield Botanical Gardens, of which I had been shamefully unaware, saved the day when my intended birthday outing fell foul of extreme weather. We went in a mixed group and very much enjoyed our visit and hope to visit again through other seasons, but found plenty of interest even in early Winter.There is no dedicated parking. We weren't in a position to use public transport that day but were pleased to find that on a Sunday we had no difficulty finding a space on a sidestreet and no fee to pay on Sundays either. The gardens themselves are free too, with donations welcome (and needed, but not oppressively solicited).The location is on a slope which affords city views but I can imagine might prove gruelling for some, especially if a wheelchair is involved.I was looking forward to seeing the National Collection of Sarcococca but that was sadly a little underwhelming as only one plant had the famous winter scent. But there was plenty else to enjoy. The Bear Pit is something a bit different, and people were hand feeding squirrels. There are many fine trees, and a lovely sculpture of Pan with many small animals to spot.The temperate glasshouse was welcome on a cold if sunny winter day and enhanced by the flautist. We might have been in a pickle as there is a notice on the door banning dogs but we could see other people coming out with theirs, we decided not to leave anyone standing out in the cold. Whilst it is appropriate to exclude dogs from some glasshouses, it seemed unnecessary here. There was an intriguing kinetic water sculpture which sadly wasn't working quite as it should.Didn't visit the café as we were away home for birthday cake, but everyone (from 80+ to  20 to blind and half deaf dog) wants to go again in Spring, Summer and Autumn."
299,Victorian splendour,There is nothing better to beat the stress of a working week than spending an hour or two wandering through here. It's constantly changing with the seasons so I try to visit at least once a month. You'll probably see some of Sheffield's best fed squirrels running around or one of the many different species of birds.
