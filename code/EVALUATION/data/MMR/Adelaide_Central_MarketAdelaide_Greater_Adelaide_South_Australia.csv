The fruit and vegetables are so fresh. There are stores that sell seafood, wines, teas, ice cream, sweets, cakes, fresh bread and so much more. The Adelaide Central Market is located next to a street with lots of Chinese restaurants and some really good coffee shops. You could wander around this area all day starting with breakfast then go on to have lunch and finish off with dinner without leaving the area.

123,Interesting market,It is a very clean and nice FOOD market but absolutely nothing special. If you are not going to buy vegetables or meet I would say that you could get better lunch elsewhere. I wish we would have chosen a tour to the vine district instead.
124,I like markets...,A great but compact market with lots of yummy looking local produce. We found some quaint red tables and chairs then wandered around sourcing our lunch to eat in buzzy atmosphere.
125,Highlight of Adelaide ,"We ate at the market food hall, which is very busy on Friday nights. Reasonable variety of Asian-type foods, priced quite reasonably. Very family friendly and pretty noisy - one young stall holder has a powerful voice and isn’t afraid to use it to keep the queue moving...I chose At Thai Kitchen and my husband chose beef in plum sauce from Tastes of China, which he had previously tried and liked. Not this time - beef was mostly tough and stringy. Not too pleased. But mine was nice: green curry, with plenty of green veges and chicken, served with a well-packed mound of white rice. I’d probably have this again. Obviously, the luck of the draw, here. Possible hygiene alert: some of the cleaning cloths being used on the plastic carry-trays looked none-too-clean."
126,Adelaide Central Market,Diverse range of food; great atmosphere and has great eateries. Easy access by tram. Just bring an appetite and your shopping cart.
127,"If you can't find food you like, Go home",We had heard from people markets are good to eat at. Smaller and more intimate than Melbournes market but cosmopolitan in its feel with bits and pieces that would be good as gifts. A must visit in Adelaide. Easy to get to in public transport but we easily found a park 300m away. Delicious food and good coffee.
128,One of the best parts of our trip,It was very enjoyable to visit the market and hear of its history over the last 150 years and to meet some of the multicultural stall holders.It was also good to be able to taste some of the diverse range of products on sale.Most enjoyable. A great atmosphere.
129,If that’s an ant then it’s for me,"Whether your after chicken, meat, fresh fish, oysters, fresh veg, smallgoods, cheeses, nuts, fresh bread of every shape and size, coffee, a snack, lunch or just the unique atmosphere of a market, then look no further.. Adelaide central markets has it all! Love it!!"

131,market review,"This is the best place to go to satisfy your food needs. So much variety. Food from different countries are widely available as well. Definitely a must stop for food lovers. Sausages, fruits, cheese, veggies, pastries, name it, they have it here"
132,Lots and lots of food,Spent a few hours wandering around the market - there is an abundance of produce stalls maybe even too many but lots of other things that make it an interesting visit. Well worth some time
133,Feeding our faces,"There is a fabulous rang of every food item you can think of from fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood and bread. Prices are far lower than at supermarkets and you can see the difference in the quality and freshness. You can get a ""big"" breakfast or lunches (gourmet rolls with fillings like fresh fig and prosciutto) or visit China town or Vietnamese stalls for something spicy. There is also a Coles supermarket, butchers, bakeries, jewellers, shoe shops, travel agents, tavern etc. Easy access by tram or bus."
134,"HUGE market, great to visit even if you don’t need to buy anything!","What a great place to wander around. So many stalls selling everything from fresh fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, cheese and dried nuts. Lots of street food outlets. Very clean. Ample parking, although we walked from our hotel.

139,"Deli, vegetable, icecream and much much more","Love the atmosphere, the range, the people, its a great way to spend a Friday night or part of the night. Parking is good, we loved it"
140,Best shopping experience in Adelaide ,"Some great cheese, dairy and bakery options but sadly they had limited free samples to try which is half the fun of a market!"
141,Market at its best .,This is a permanent market selling a vast amount of fresh fruit and vegetables from local growers. Our five night stay was in the centre of the CBD so it was so easy to get to the market by using the free tram which stops outside the main entrance.
142,"""Eat your way around ""","We came to the market each morning for breakfast, each day trying a new place. Everywhere was delicious!!  There are many unique vendors too. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables are available also meats and cheeses. Definitely a must if you are in Adelaide."

145,Great Souvenirs,"We went once while we stayed in Adelaide but wanted to visit again. There were fresh vegetables, fruits, meats. I was not able to go restaurant there which seems very tasty. Hope to visit next time.You can also get Honey from Kangaroo island. Australian made soaps, too.I was not sure if the parking was free or not but better to go by car if you plan to buy lots of vegetables and fruits. You can go easily by bus as well.Free Wifi was not there I think, but you can always get free Wifi in front of Bank, most likely any bank in central Adelaide.アデレード 滞在中に一度だけしかいけず、また行きたいと思っていた場所でした。レストランも時間帯が合わずほとんどしまっていましたが、美味しそうなところがありました。シドニーの友人からもオススメの場所と聞いていました。新鮮な野菜やフルーツが買えるだけでなく、カンガルー島でとれるハチミツを購入できたりオーストラリアで作られた石鹸も購入できました。コーヒーも売ってました。無料Wifiはなかったと思いますが、アデレード 市内の銀行の前には必ずあります。"
146,Fantastic Market ,"A favourite place of ours when in Adelaide and a good place to catch up with family. There is a multi level carpark which makes access easy, even when my brother was in a wheel chair, the access was good. The local produce is on display with King George whiting and Coffin bay oysters, large plump rabbits in the game displays, wonderful tasty duck terrines and goose liver pates, the tastes are truly tempted here. On the Saturday morning it was packed with no tables available so we bought up supplies and went to a park for a wonderful lunch."
147,Shopping Experience ,Coming from Darwin we were delighted at the array and choice of fruit and veg - bought some mangosteins and they were perfect!!
148,Large and diverse,"I shop at the central market fortnightly. I take advantage of the free car Pk. I’m in and out in an hour.Love the place . The friendly atmosphere and the beautiful aromas. Large variety of fruit and vegetables. Flower shops, asian shops, butchers and all sorts. Great for a coffee or a meal . Plenty to choose from. Definitely a must to experience. Even if for only an hour."
149,Great place,"Oh! I LOVE this market because of the variety of cheeses, bake goods, Turkish delight and fresh local produce!! Great place for quick grab and go breakfast and snacks. Closed on Sundays and Mondays! Would have loved to share pictures, but unfortunate I have downloaded all my pictures."
150,Outstanding ,This is the quintessential marketplace full of vendors ranging from fruits to bakery items to meats to restaurants. Be sure to visit on a Friday when they stay open until 9pm instead of the usual 5pm close time!
151,Shopping trip and lunch with one of my Grandsons,"We spent an enjoyable couple of hours here, soaking up the buzz of the market stalls, quirky book shops, so many places to eat, we went for Italian. I bought bush honey and tried a sample of their local gin, a must visit."
152,Walking breakfast tour,We spent 8 days in Adelaide and visited the market several times.  There is a great variety of excellent fresh  available.  Recommend visiting.
153,Touring,"If you are into gourmet foods, this is the place to go. The delicious smells waft into your nose and immediately you are drawn to different cheeses, fruit and vegetables, different breads plus numerous other treats. There are places to have a coffee plus several eateries close by. Whatever you do, ensure this is on your to do list in Adelaide. I am sure, if you love your food like I do, you will not be disappointed."
154,Fun couple of hours,"Great multicultural food market, so much choice and in a great location.We visited on a Friday late afternoon and the place was vibrant and offered so much to see, try and buy."

156,"Delicious food, fresh produce! ","The Adelaide Central market is fabulous. It is a unique under cover food market with something for everyone. Lots of great vegetable stalls, amazing choices and lots of food stalls for the hungry. It needs to be preserved as it's an icon of Adelaide."
157,Great market,"If you’re visiting Adelaide then a trip to the markets is something you really have to do. If you’re after fresh produce then you have to come to the markets. I’ve included some pictures of amazing fruit, veg etc  but the photos just don’t do them the justice they deserve. There is a huge choice of fresh vegetables, fruit, deli meats, cheese, bread, cakes, nuts and lots more. I come from the NT and we just don’t get this quality or variety. The colours, smells and choices can be quite overwhelming if you haven’t been here before. Take your time, talk to the amazing people who work here, ask them what they recommend.  They will tell you what’s best on the day. If you want good coffee, then you will be spoilt for choice, there are a lot of very good cafes and coffee stalls where you can buy everything related to coffee.The markets are also home to some amazing eateries, there are so many choices for either breakfast or lunch."
158,Great fresh food market,We had seen green ants for sale to eat on a Travel Guides program and were determined to find the stall - The girls were lovely and only too happy for us to taste the ants - a burst of citrus - would eat again! They also have succulents for salads and bison meat - such fun. The sugar can drinks at the back of the market are superb - we had lime and sugar cane and then lemon and ginger - fantastic - a great mock cocktail!
159,Lunch trip,This is a must for anyone that loves fresh food and cooking. So much choice and all fresh. We spent a lot of time here and with the help of the friendly staff picked an amazing array of food to create several superb meals. It is well worth a visit.
160,Sensational,Adelaide Central Markets are a real gem!Really appreciated If you have travelled elsewhere since they are a venue seldom matched elsewhere in the world.We often do not appreciate what exists on our own doorstep!!
161,Wonderful market brimming with fine food and provisions ,"In the inner city of Adelaide you can travel by tram free.  Caught a tram to the market.  It's a big covered market of local bits and pieces and fresh food (vegetables,  meats, cheeses,  etc.).  It was 42 degrees outside  but AC inside was wonderful.  Many eateries,  many meat/fish shops and many vegetable/fruit stalls.  Prices were reasonable with mostly high quality, few exceptions  however.  Overall a good place to visit and try/buy local and further afield produce.  You should visit here if visit7 Adelaide."
162,Traditional Excellence ,"We spent an entire morning browsing around the market and made several purchases including, cooked meats, bread, cheese and wine which we enjoyed sitting on our hotel balcony watching the sunset.There is a vast amount on offer here of the finest quality, it’s worth a look around even if you don’t buy anything, there are several great places to have lunch or just a coffee and lots of stalls offering samples. Stall holders are friendly and helpful, all in all a great experience, we went back and bought spices to bring home."
163,A great tour for foodies,"Very nice we really enjoyed although it does get too crowded... you can find a lot in this market like fruits, vegetables, selections of cheeses, meat, seafood etc. it should be one of the “must visit” while in Adelaide!"
164,Fabulous fresh food,You can buy everything here. I love going to the central market because they have super fresh produce and I usually can see more kinds of veggies here than in the supermarket. I just love coming here!
165,A FOODIE’S PARADISE!,Wow what a gorgeous market to purchase fruit cheese nuts and vegesWith lovely street store cafe and eats on the edges of the market
166,A real place were locals go shopping. ,"Extensive indoor market with so much variety. I came here while visiting Adelaide and spent a while browsing, and then got lunch from one of the stalls (falafel - which was delicious!).Unfortunately I had no kitchen facilities where I was staying, but I could see plenty of locals buying their fruit and veg, bread, cheese, olives, dips etc etc.Definitely worth an hour or so of time!"
167,Well worth a visit!,"If you are looking for fresh fruit & vegetables in Adelaide this is the place to go. However the market has so much more than that with fresh meat, bakeries, cafes and more. A great place to enjoy brunch on the weekend."
168,This has everything!,"Unique to SA, similar to a South a Melbourne Food Markets, this place is a favourite for locals and bucket list items for visitors. Friday’s and Saturday’s are best!"
169,What a surprise to find these amazing markets,In this place you can find and buy all the food you need. All types of Asian food can be bought as well.
170,Great way to spend a Friday night,"Adelaide Central Market is very large and boasts a huge variety of regional produce - fruit and veg, meats, baked goods etc. German, Mediterranean and Asian influences are evident."
171,Good place,"We walked from the hotel to here on the day we arrived in town.  Great selection of fresh food available.We wandered around and had an impromptu meal at the Paella place which was really nice.  Then we had dessert at the cake place, which was scrumptious.The food and Veges all looked good, and the Turkish Delight place is well worth a visit.We'll be going back there on the weekend to stock up for the rest of our trip"
172,Day out,"As an amateur foodie at heart, this place  certainly delivered!There's fresh everything here.A Cheesemonger, Butcher, Fish Monger, fruit and vegetables, Sweets, fresh food and coffee (coffee is everywhere) and tea. There's massage places to retreat to for a well deserved massage. It's near Chinatown, so if you're up for Asian foods, this is a place to come and visit. The food court is quite a visit as well.I love how easy it was to move around. It's on par with Sydney's Paddy's Markets, just not as big. But, still very much worth the visit. Parking is a bit bothersome, and takes a while to get into, especially above the markets, just keep that in mind. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the markets and definitely recommend!"
173,Amazing ,Very nice traditional try the rolls with salami and the coffee close to town can walk from most hotels must see when you are there
174,A GREAT EXPEIENCE,"Central Market is a good spot for food, fresh groceries and delecacies. Parking space and cost is also a plus point."
175,Lovely stroll with quality fresh goods,"The fresh fruit, veggies, meats, cheese, fish, eateries, clothes and jewelry!  You have to see it for yourself.  Lots of places to eat and drink.  Its such a great place to do your gift shopping and pick up your groceries at awesome prices.  Farm to table shopping at its best"
176,Small Group Breakfast tour,This was a good food market with lots on offer - my favourite was the Smelly Cheese stall which had great testings available and phenomenal cheeses to try (and buy). Definitely worth it if you're hungry!
177,Amazing Food Stalls,"Centrally located, this market offers an amazing array of fresh produce and delicious treats.From cheeses and Turkish Delight to unusual fruit and veggies, and so many choices of yummy places to eat.Central Market is a must visit destination!"
178,Disappointed ,"Great atmosphere, great fresh produce. Excellent selection of cheeses, meats, fish and poultry also, and more."
179,Interesting Market,"Great little gin bar. Owner, I think Jane was full of great recommendations such as restaurants (Sean’s Kitchen) where the food was amazing!"
180,So amazing ,Used to get lolly fishes and the market with grandpa and grandma - dropped in to see that changes and smell the smells.Fun and busy and worthwhile
181,Lots of good produce and food!! ,You can't have a true Adelaide experience without spending a morning or a Friday night in the Adelaide market!! It is truely iconic with wonderful stalls and speciality stores for all kinds of local and international produce. The market connects with Adelaide's Chinatown and is surrounded by all kinds of sensational eateries from all over the world. A short walk into the city too!
182,Best place !! You find everything !,"Markets like this are few and far between. We love the traditional covered market and this one is excellent. Fresh produce, very reasonably priced (compared to Sydney) and a great range of local produce and specialty shops. Wish we could have something like this in Sydney - then we’d be here every week."
183,Can't believe that I am reviewing markets,"We spent an enjoyable morning at the Adelaide markets. Arrived by tram, after a very short walk to the markets, we were impressed by the activity around us. The stalls were mixed and varied. Food stalls especially colourful with a wide range of produce. A very enjoyable and memorable visit."
184,Every week visit,"My husband and I visited as was recommended and was great! A massive market selling so much different fresh fruit, vegetables, meats, seafood, as well as chocolate, coffee, skincare products and books! Would recommend!"
185,Worth a visit,Adelaide Central Market is very popular with both locals and tourists.  There are many stalls offering a wide range of foods- both fresh and cooked.  We found an excellent butcher and many fruit and veg outlets so there was lots of choice in both price and quality.  On some days not all stalls are open.  There is  good access to Coles from the markets.  Public transport is nearby as are car parks including one above the markets.
186,Brilliant,"The breakfast tour of the Adelaide Central Market is an unique way to see the shops.  Given by a guide who starts you off with a piece of fruit and specially ordered coffee, you tour the market sampling the goods as you walk from stall to stall. It allows one to sample the different types of food available as well as confirm their freshness in being brought to market.  A fun way to start your day. It is surprisingly not tiring as there is so much to  see and taste. Comfortable shoes a must."
187,Great!!!,Highly recommend the tasting tour. Chantelle was very knowledgeable and fun guide. Especially the wild food experience.
188,Local favourite ,"We had a delightful visit and the food and vegetables are high quality. There are great eating houses ""Big Table"" served wonderful brunch. Highly recommended."
189,A highlight of a weekend in Adelaide ,Someone had mentioned while in Adelaide to go to the markets. I didn't know much  about them and didn't realize they were undercover. How lucky are the people who live in Adelaide to have these markets. The cheese shops were stocked with amazing cheeses from all over the world. There were quaint little wine and coffee bars and so many stalls with the freshest fruit and vegies. I wish Sydney had markets like this.
190,Like the markets in France,"You must come here :)Not only do you get the freshest fruit and veg, meat and baked goods but there's loads of random stalls selling all sorts - highly recommend the Turkish delight stall. There's also loads of cafes around the outer edge and plenty of seating so you can easily get a good meal (and it's right next to Chinatown too).Check out their events too as we had lots of free Jazz when we happened to be there"
191,Busy market with lots of produce and eats,"Loved the Adelaide Central Market. I probably wouldn't have visited, or spent much time there except for my local mate who was very passionate about it. I can see why! It has a fantastic atmosphere! Amazing food options - ate breakfast and lunch here on different days - were my favourite, but the fresh food options in the very heart of the city centre were also incredible. Great juice bars. Has a bit of everything and great location. Chinatown right next door. Loved it."
192,Interesting food market,"Well worth a visit. The produce and stalls were top quality. Had a great ambience, and a 'foodie heaven'"
193,Excellent,The Adelaide Central Market is fantastic it has a huge amount of food & vegetables including shops and next to China Town and is very responsible priced parking at the U Park Car park at 2 hours for $7 connected to the Markets.
194,A fantastic market from a foodie ,Truly one of the best markets I have visited amazing varieties of food from baked goods to specialty meats sausages cold cuts.Vegetables and fruit from many different places. Then they also sell beer wine and other drinks all at very reasonable prices.
195,Fresh produce,"What an amazing place. Al fresco dining of every kind and the hustle and bustle of an open market with fruit and veges so fresh, it must still be growing! The most amazing selection of cheeses I have ever seen and loads of wine specials. A great place to visit even for people watching, while supping a fresh coffee or beer. Spent 3 hours here and only saw a small part of the complex."
196,I love markets ,"Come here every time I'm in Adelaide. It's everything a market should be. Fresh, interesting and diverse range of food with lots of little eating places from different cultures. Head turning every 5 minutes, you can spend a LOT of time here. Just be aware of the parking fees. Lovely coffee and cake at Jamface. Highly recommend the fresh fish, esp the Coorong mullet. Wish I lived next door!"
197,Central Market,"As an Adelaide local I could not remember my last trip to Adelaide Central Market. As I sat having lunch with my bestie last week, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of the Market, I made a promise to myself that I would make it a regular experience. The food, the people and the vibe is amazing! Whether you're a local or a visitor, Adelaide Central Market us a must."
198,Market food,As a local Adelaide resident the central market part of my weekly shopping and dining calendar and never disappoint. If you are a visitor or a local these markets are a must.
199,"Fresh produce, great value for money!","I visited the market on a Friday night around 7. It is a very busy market, with many stalls of produce, fish, meats, cheeses, and many eating establishments.  Easy to get to from center city square tram stop.  Ends in Chinatown.  Many other restaurants are around the area, too.  Kangaroo Island store, and a special Turkish Delight store are a must."
200,God I LOVE this place!,The market caters for every food taste and looked fresh and high quality.  We had a quick walk around before our flight and took in the sights.  We had a few free samples and experienced friendly service from all.
201,Has everything gourmet ,"We arrived in this market close to lunch time and it was boozing already with suppliers, fish mongers and a great array of stands and food vendors (raw products and already by products ready to eat).The place has several sections and it called my attention and actual French chef making terrines, pates, quiches and the whole nine yards of good ol French cuisine.Finally and after chatting and eating some of these delicacies we encounter the apple of my eye...a small Colombian place selling Colombiana drink, Arepas, Empanaditas, etc, etc. We had a a lovely time. The market is accessible with public transportation and it is very central and easy to find.Have at it and enjoy this food jewel. Highly recommended. In our itinerary we found it very useful and fulfilling."
202,Full cultural immersion ,We stayed close to this market and went there about 4 times while we were in Adelaide. Seriously great delicatessens and produce stalks. Also good coffee shops and dessert outlets. We stocked up cheeses and deli foods for our hotel room and lunched there too. We loved it.
203,What an eye opener ,A very large covered market close to the city centre just up from Rundle mall band Victoria Square.You will find a huge variety of foodstuff and potential gifts. Just fun to look around
204,Lots of food to see,"The Market is so amazing. There is food from all over the world. Fresh produce at great prices. Great Meat, Cheeses, Cakes and the choice of cooked food is so vast. Each time we visit we take home amazing breads, Cheeses, Veg, Also some interesting food from other countries, Russian, Italian, Greek, Asian to name a few. It is a vibrant place to visit."
205,Not to be missed!,"Had a really good time walking around looking at all the different food stalls, delicious is the word that comes to mind. Friendly people and a lovely hour or two spent wondering around. Would recommend for sure. I didn’t take any photos sorry."
206,A must if you have the time,I love markets anyway but this one definitely one of the best I have visited. Fabulous layout and choice. Great fresh produce and delicious food options everywhere. Well worth a wander but preferably bring an appetite.
207,Wished I liv d close by!,"Adelaide Central Market is a precious jewel in the heart of the city. Fresh vegetables and fruits, cheeses, small goods, meats, fish, poultry, bakeries, cafes, cuisines of Italy, Malaysia, Germany, France, China, India have their home here. Locals and visitors dine on the best, take home bags stuffed with delicious treats free from chemicals and packaging. There is a pulsing life bursting with vitality and camaraderie founded on the bounty of the soil and the sea. The best in the world available to all who come."
208,Great place to eat,I never would have thought that I'd review a market but these markets are really good.  Fantastic fresh produce and awesome food.Every stall holder is genuinely and accommodating.  Definitely a place to visit in Adelaide.
209,Not just shopping but an experience,"The place was buzzing, so keep an eye on the kids.Food hall seemed very authentic.  It felt as though you were at an overseas night.Hunt the best deals on the fruit and veg or sneak some awesome lollies in."
210,Worth frequenting ,"New to Adelaide we spent a morning looking around the market. The huge number of varying food stalls was amazing and worth a visit when first arriving in Adelaide if you need produce for an apartment stay. A few souvenir and other stalls also which we found to be good value. Although it shows ""Chinatown"" as part of the market, this is for restaurant food only."
211,Lovely market with lots of interesting stalls,"Love, love, love.... we go regularly for a Saturday brunch, so many wonderful food stalls, that I don't know where to begin... well worth a visit as a top destination for Adelaide.  Great breakfast places, fantastic coffee...any type of food you wish to buy and just the vibe...just love sitting in the food section near Zumas or Lucias and absorbing the atmosphere of a busy morning of people watching..... go and do this....."
212,Great Produce,This place is great easy to get around plenty to see. Plenty of places to eat.Has been going for over 150 years.Well worth a visit.
213,Must visit for lovers of fresh food,"I really liked the breakfast choices that were available at the markets. It’s really the same as what is available elsewhere (fresh fruit, vegetables, bread etc)."
214,Market tour,I was blown away by my visit to the Market I had no idea Australia had a food market to match the likes of Barcelona but it does .. enjoy the coffee bars and array of local produce.
215,A nice stroll,"With one day in Adelaide, we had to revisit the Central Market.  We started with a huge Chicken Dim Sim which was almost on par with the Sth Melbourne Market ones.  Then we found the Porchetta & Canolli Bar and really pigged out. As a finale, we bought a bottle of red from Vintage Cellars and some double brie and fresh baguette from the Say Cheese shop for the Hotel Room.  We were in a foodies heaven!"
216,Who doesn't like a market?,"Each time we visit adelaide we stop over at the central markets. As Sydneysiders we are spoilt for ""Rundel Mall"" type shops which you find in many of our cities. But the Central Market ozzes personality, character and uniqueness. So for us it's the place to go for fruit, coffee, fish - actually just about anything but Goochy handbags."
217,Amazing ,We really enjoyed visiting this market on a rainy day in Adelaide since it is fully enclosed.  It had a great mix of fresh food and restaurant vendors and offers a wonderful view into the multicultural influences in the city.
218,"A wonderland of sights, smells and tastes",This market is as good as it gets.  Variety/display mouth watering. If I lived in Adelaide as I would do all my shopping here. Its paradise for cooks and foodies.
219,Wandering around Adelaide on a wet winter's day,"This is a real gem in Adelaide. There are all sorts of produce available (fruit, meat, fish, coffee, cheese and arts/crafts). All the produce looked great and all the stall holders were so friendly snd helpful. A must go to venue and located in the centre of town. There is a large car park too. Don’t miss it!"
220,So much to see,"Great tour, only few people in group. Markets were busy but got around fine. Clarisse our guide was up to date with products and looked after us. We got to taste and see a great array of products."
221,This market is quite unique as the whole market is not covered by roof and next to it is China town,"Of the many central markets visited, this was rather disappointing. There's hardly any human traffic & variety of stalls not many. We had a quick walk around, did not attract us to stop at any shops & just went across to the Chinatown foodcourt to have our late lunch."
222,Beautiful array of fresh fruits and Vegetables,"This market has to rate above Borough Market as one of the most authentic food markets in the world.    An abundance of fruit, meat, cheese and much, much more.   The place is always buzzing with people,  bringing a vibrancy to it.  Well worth a visit."
223,A great tour - a tick for the .bucket list!,A relative who we were visiting in Adelaide recommended that we visit. Perhaps they recognised that we are foodies and would come back well loaded for dinner that night! Start with a coffee at The Grind. Avoid imported cheese. Fantastic Aussie cheese available. Try the Tasmanian Triple Cream Brie. To die for. That is if you eat a kilo every day.  Our favourite blue - King Island Dairy Ash Blue. Great honey shop - but .... if you are travelling interstate within Australia honey products are not allowed. If you are not vegetarian try some of the exotic meats. Sorry Skippy.
224,Lots of food and activity ,"Adelaide Central Market is one of the best markets I've been to- an emporium for gourmet foods and delicatessen items. It showcases the best of South Australian produce in a big labyrinthine set up of stalls that winds in circles.There are vintage book stalls, sweet cakes, french patisseries, and different cuisines for lunch. I explored the markets over two days- the first day was more like a reconnaissance mission, and the second was to revisit favourite treats. I enjoyed a roast porchetta baguette with wild broccoli for lunch- meaty, decadent, salty goodness. Delicious!The stallholders are lovely, happy to have a chat with you, especially if you're a traveller, and keen to make recommendations. South Australia is the nation's gourmet food bowl. Here, you'll find delicious cured meats, locally produced gins, a plethora of cheeses and fresh ground coffee. I bought a series of dips and fresh breads, meats, cheeses and more for a picnic back home. Best decision I made while in Adelaide."
225,Fresh & Cheap,"I went to the market, purely as a Masterchef fan, I wanted to visit Poh's Jamface. Unfortunately I happened to visit a day after its closing, so unable to experience the venue (although it will be popping up at Adelaide Airport in future, so will definitely visit there). Disappointment quickly set aside, the market is a lovely enclosed undercover venue, with many stalls. Being a Wednesday morning, many of the stalls were not open, so we probably didn't get the full vibe of what the market had to offer. There are some great artwork on the walls, niche stallholders, and plenty of variety. I had some porchetta (with crackling to die for) and bagel/almond croissant/zeppole from a bakery. A must do for visitors."
226,A feast for your senses,"It's bigger then l thought it would be, the range available is excellent, and the cheeses and breads, well the smells are just amazing.Every where l stopped the sellers were amazing, gave samples out, explaining where the differ things come from. Bought some amazing cheeses and breads, and some truffle oil, which smells amazing.Wish l had longer to spend there exploring."
227,Variety of Fresh Produce,I’m a foodie. This is a slice of heaven !! I was interested in these markets because of celebrity chef Poh .. but there is so much more depth to these markets than that. I didn’t even eat at PieFace as I’m a very Green Foodie liking  gluten free sugar free natural wholefoods most !  We investigated aisle by aisle and spent a good part of the day there !! Oh the choices and variety !!Delicious local produce and freshly made everything. Visit. Eat. Enjoy.
228,Paradise,Market has a varied produce providers who are very pleasant to discuss their items.Stalls are in aisle concept with ample room to stroll through.There are plenty of cafe's to buy lunch but we bought bread rolls from a bakery then got ham and cheese from one of the deli's.There are several entrances into market which borders on Chinatown.A very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.
229,Genuine city market,Yum yum yum ...this gem offers north African food freshly prepared.  The owner was engaging and advised us of his recommendations...delish!
230,Food icon,If you are into your food then you can’t get better than this. This is an indoor market with a large number of stalls selling a very wide variety of produce. There are also stalls selling coffee and food to eat on the premises as well as cafes. This is one of the must do things in Adelaide.
231,A diverse market,"We took our grandson of four into the market for a look around. I used to dash in there at least one day a week mainly to the Asian shops, but since I’ve been retired I don’t go as much.The overall ambience is the same, full of vibration ,colour and people.New stores seem to be popping up and they are very interesting. The one that took our eye  mostly was the Turkish delight shop, which is filled with amazing mountains of colourful and exotic looking confection.I could have bought one of everything!We wondered around, sampling everything  .....cheese, olives, a mushroom cooked with truffle salt here, a mandarin slice there.It was comforting to see old friends like Lucia’s and the Providore.. the fish shops and the flower stall , which had buckets of divine peonies in all colours.We grabbed some more scrumptious cheese sticks from the trusty Say Cheese stall and we were out in just under an hour, so parking was free too! Bonus!"
232,Amazing variety and value ,Great place to visit even if U are not looking to buy veriaty colorful pleanty of people and a big tasty oriental food court with realy great stuff few hours big fan . Easy cheep parking one of a mast see in Adelaide
233,Best produce market in Adelaide,The quality and variety of produce available at the Central Market was amazing. Everything is presented beautifully with lots of samples to taste. And we had a great breakfast at Zuma
234,Loved this place good food,"We were in Adelaide for the Pink Ball Test & decided to visit the Market to show our friends, who hadn't been there before. It is an interesting market & we enjoyed wandering around the many stalls offering fresh food, meat & fish, as well as the specialty stalls with second-hand books, the Asian section, and the coffee stands. This market is well laid-out, easy to navigate & fun to visit."
235,A must for a visit to Adelaide,A huge food and vegetables market on ground floor...I enjoyed there...it connected  me to the local culture and the people
236,Breakfast,"The Central Market is truly outstanding.  The largest market of its type in the southern hemisphere, you will find anything you could possibly want to eat or drink.  There are cheese shops paired with bread shops; a Turkish Delight vendor; a stall dedicated to yogurt; wine purveyors; spice shops, etc.  In addition, the vegetables and fruit stalls are magnificent.  Piles of beautiful, fresh veggies and fruits at every turn.  There is no way to see it all.  There are multiple meat vendors, including those selling wild game.  We went to the market twice in the eight days we visited Adelaide.The parking is a little bit of a challenge.  You can park directly above the market, or chose a parking structure about a block away for a little bit less.  If you want to eat there, restaurants are around the edges of the space.  There are multiple different types of cuisine."
237,Great on a Friday night,This place has everything you could want from a supermarket that is fresh and under one roof. I really wish that we had somewhere like this in the West of Scotland. For the best choice I'd say get there before lunch but if looking for a bargain you can go a bit later when some of the independent traders are selling off some stick for cheap.Everln if you are just passing through it is well worth visit just to see how amazing the produce is and you can pick up some snacks for your journey and even grab some lunch in one of the many cafes and restaurant's in the area.You really most visit this place to appreciate what it has to offer.
238,Great selection of local produce,"Market has excellent range of produce, bakeries, fish, meat and coffee shops. Central location, clean and good value"
239,Great market,Great cafes - restaurants - market stalls - atmosphere - shops!!!I love this place ... don't debate ... just GO VISIT!!!
240,Free market with great food stalls,"This is one if the best markets I have ever been to. It is super colourful, not too noisy, clean and well organised. There are so many wonderful lunch options and fresh produce at great prices!"
241,fun filled and free,"Located in the central area of Adelaide near the China town. The fresh food market has a huge range of deli, fruit veggies and meats opening from the morning. There are many restaurants in the surrounding area. Plenty of carpark in the building but very full."
242,Interesting market,"Probably the best indoor market we visited on our tour round Australia earlier this year - at least, it was definitely our favourite! Well organised, accessible and well laid out, buzzing with a great atmosphere. There is a huge selection of food stalls - delis, cheese stalls, fresh bread and pastries, fresh ad smoked fish, fresh fruit/veg/salads, fresh meet - to name but a few. As we were self catering we decided to buy items for dinner and bought some amazing steak and fish salads. The market also boasts a variety of popular and excellent quality eateries. Fabulous market - enjoyed it so much we went back for breakfast one morning. Highly recommended."
243,fantastic array of stalls,"As a result of a friend’s recommendation as a “must see”, we visited early on a Tuesday morning sampling the freshest of fruit by way of a breakfast followed by wonderful bread and pastries. We returned later that afternoon to buy pate, cheeses, olives, salad veg,   bread and wine, returning to our apartment for a delicious meal. This market is the best we’ve visited in Australia and is a foodies paradise. When visiting Adelaide, you just must find time to spend a few hours here - you will not regret it."
244,Excellent food shopping ,"...however this at the more functional end of world markets. There are better things to do with an hour of your life in Adelaide than go here. Unless you want fruit, then it's worth a visit."
245,Wonderful Market!,"I visited on a Friday lunchtime, one of the busiest times but still a glorious experience. I wandered , seeking lunch and found little Cambodian kitchen - fab flavours. Strolling through offerings of fine fresh veg i was entranced by glorious  wafts of mushroom, cheese, baked goods. I chose a couple of bottles of organic wines for $20 the lot. Very satisfying visit"
246,"""To market to market""","What a marvellous experience.  The many different cheeses were to die for.  There were sooo many stalls with sweets, nuts, chocolates, breads, fruits and veggies, meat, fish, eating places etc.  beautiful cakes. And so many other things.  The Chinese food court was next door.  Well worth visiting."
247,Memory lane at Adel Central Market. ,"What a terrific concept.  All produce under one roof.  Has been here for eons.  An Adelaide icon.  Get cheese, fruit, olives, fresh meat and chicken, chocolate, nuts, smallgoods, exquisite coffees, Italian specialities, health/whole foods, eateries, supermarkets, Chinatown,  and much much more..."
248,Stroll Around The Markets,"This is a huge market with beautiful displays of fruit and vegetables. Also a large range of butchers products and small goods. Locally produced bread, pastries and cakes are also available. There are wine stalls as well as produce from Kangaroo island."
249,Great market for food! ,"Right smack in the center and just 15 min walk from our hotel (Mercure Grosvenor) . Colorful and full of life and lots of eateries around with freshly cooked options like Italian, Asian, local, Turkish etc . We went crazy with cheese and other beautiful condiments. Great spot for lunch , tourist attraction or food shopping all rolled into one!"
250,Amazing food,"We’ve toured many ‘central markets’ over many years of travel.  I would classify this one as average when compared to others.  As a benchmark, we recently visited Barcelona, and their central market is exceptional!  Nonetheless, worthy of a visit on a drab day."
251,"Great Market , best produce","Ever since I mentioned I was going to Adelaide, I was told check out the markets! Wow was I blown off my feet. You can buy anything here from food, to pharmacy and everything in between. We caught the free connector bus. Lots of fresh food."
252,Discovery Tour,We unfortunately went on a Wednesday and some of the stalls are not open but the ones that were open certainly made up for it. I ate breakfast at Le Souk. Best food and excellent friendly service. If you are staying in Adelaide come to the markets to do all of your food shopping. You won't be sorry.
253,Great quality local produce,"This has to be one of the best markets in the country. It is so well laid out, easy to navigate, not too crowded, and reasonably priced. I was staying nearby so did my grocery shopping here throughout my stay in Adelaide, and ended up strolling through nearly every day. It felt great to buy local produce and support independent business. I was pleasantly surprised how reasonable the prices were (and the quality was ten times better than what was in Coles next door!)."
254,The big market ,"We have visited all the markets in the main capital cities and these food markets are great. These are way better than the ones at home in Sydney which are pretty poor. They have a lot of fresh quality produce and we bought some local wines, delicious French tarts and some reasonably priced fruit. If We lived in Adelaide would definitely buy my produce at the markets."
255,Great place,As a part of your we were brought to visit the central market.We were happily surprised to find it a real place were locals go shopping for food or to have a drink and a bite.After all one hour well spent.
256,Amazing Markets,"As an Adelaide resident, I had wanted to do a Central Market tour for a long time - I took the opportunity to gift the breakfast tour to my daughter, who lives overseas, so I got to do it too! We started with a delicious breakfast and coffee, then Cheryl gave us a great tour and imparted a wealth of interesting background on the Market - I thought I knew all about it, but learnt so much more! Particularly  enjoyed visiting the Indigenous foods and Kangaroo island stalls. And to finish - another great coffee! I will be back to shop at the Market and my daughter is keen to take her fiancée on a tour as well. Highly recommended - thank you Cheryl!"
257,Whilst it is a fun place at the same time very dear.,"Wow talk about noisey hundreds of stalls and everybody shouting but such a great two hours,  bought heaps"
258,One of my most Favourite Plces to go to!!,"The market was similar to a farmers market in the U.S. except the ""stores"" had established areas and were more like mini storefronts. There was an attached food court located within Chinatown. They had mostly fresh food but also jams, honey, lotions, and other items."
259,A must do with an amazing range of produce,"They say this is an the largest ""covered"" fresh produce market in the southern hemisphere and it fells like. Still many people come here for their daily shopping. you can also grab a cheap meal here. Open late on friday night, closes early saturday and closed sunday and monday."
260,Fantastic Place To Visit,"We love walking through these type of places , good history and different cultures ,its like travelling overseas, without the cost.Do yourself a favour and visit !"
261,Much of the same ,Really great time with lots of food and strange things like kangaroo crocodile and other. I like the cheeses and fruits very cheap.
262,"Plenty to see,eat and buy",We only get into the Central Markets a few times a year and go a bit crazy when we do. Special mentions to:- Le Souk - great coffee and breakfast- Wild Loaf - love their Fig and Walnut loaf- House of Health - multiple muesli options at good prices- Dough - bagels and cakes make me salivatePlenty of others to spend your money at and always busy. Wish they were open Sundays but can't be greedy.
263,What a great place,"I just loved Central Market. You find everything you are looking for and what you have not thought about it too. Great variety of fresh produce , good quality deli and butcher's. Several options for snacks or meals , great variety and well priced."
264,Best place in Adelaide for foodies!,My wife and I booked this tour with Adelaide Central Market Tours and our guide Cheryl gave us a super guided tour with so many tastings.Cheryl was so knowledgeable and is well know in the market.We did not feel the 3 hours pass and were sad that it was over .Very well planned by the operator and we recommend this tour if u visit Adelaide.
265,Shopping ,As I was backpacking and only had a couple of days in Adelaide buying food wasn’t really on the agenda. Great to see the market but unless you are buying produce not that useful.
266,Worth the visit,We went there a few times just looking around and enjoying the shops and what they were selling...and different items ...
267,Limited tasting,"Visited on Thursday 27th February and again on Friday 28th February. There is so much to see and do there, what an amazing place. On Thursday we just checked it out and then returned on Friday to have lunch there, so many choices and the food is so cheap."
268,Fantastic,We always go the the big market when we are in a new town.  This is a good one and located in a central area.  Lots of stuff to buy here and some places to eat.
269,Debbie,We went for a visit early on a Friday morning.  Our first hour it was easy to walk around but quickly got busy after that.  Lots of sample products from stallholders who were all super friendly. There is also some lovely restaurants attacted.
270,So Much Fooood....,"If you are from out of town or live in Adelaide,  this is a must visit. As I still work part time in the city, I do the weekly fruit, veg and meat shop here. Don't forget the great cheese, bread, coffee and cakes available. In fact it is all great.CHECK IT OUT. You won't be disappointed."
271,Gems to be found,"We are so jealous that such a place of energy, noise, quality and diversity isn’t in our home town. We would go there even if it was only to go there and enjoy the vibrance of the stalls and the customers. The quality and range of food was incredible and only regretted we didn’t have longer to enjoy it let alone take advantage of the market and buy our groceries if we were locals"
272,Hit and Miss,It’s Banshee and MungoWe hadn’t been to the markets for a whileI would like to say how fabo these markets areWe have travelled extensively all around our beautiful planet The Adelaide Central Markets are the bestWe highly recommend calling inMungo
273,Sooo good,I have travel the world almost but this would have to be my favourite so good I went back a few times for breakfast and lunch the food is fresh and the coffee is great don't mis it.
274,Fantastic food experience,"As a child growing up in Adelaide we went Adelaide Central Market every Saturday. My Grandmother loved the hot cashews from Charlesworth nuts (and they're still there) plus the weeks supply of fresh fruit, vegetables. These days there are a couple of great fishmongers, butchers and a couple of fantastic restaurants as well, I especially like Lucia's Pizza and Spaghetti Bar and Le Souk and ofcourse the wonderful cheese shops, Say Cheese and The Smelly Cheese.It's a great place full of wonderful sounds, cultures and smells, a truly great experience  for everyone."
275,Adelaide Central Market,Great food selectionsGreat coffee selectionsSeafood? Could not find what was needesFruit and vegetables fresh and a great selection and stallsUnlike Sydney markets all avaliable are first class not seconds
276,Easy and enjoyable,"Our group of 6 visited these markets on 4 occasions during our 2 week stay in Adelaide. We had breakfast there twice and did a lot of shopping to pick up up supplies for our AirBnB house. I can safely say these are the best Markets in Australia, fantastic goods on offer and some great coffee there. We just loved the atmosphere amongst the throng of people."
277,Exciting variety of fresh produce ,"This must be one of the best Central Markets I have visited, as well as one of the largest, if In Adelaide it is certainly worth a visit, the produce is fresh and tasty too, the coffee at the coffee stall is a must have too.  Additionally just of the the main part of the market, is Adelaide China town which has a fantastic Asian food court, and believe me the food is fantastic, and cheap too."
278,Full of wonderful produce!,I walked in and thought I was in Europe.  There's a wonderful array of stores and a terrific atmosphere.  Head there for a meal or simply a wander around to take in the atmosphere.  The produce is fresh and the vendors are passionate about their produce.  Not to be missed!
279,Pbobb,"My  husband and I attended the  small group breakfast  tour it was fantastic. Our guide Cheryl was awesome, very informative and a load of fun. Allow plenty of time as the tour takes a couple of hours and trust me you will want to go back and pick up lots of goodies after the tour. We would highly recommend going to these markets and doing the tour when visiting Adelaide."
280,Once you should go if in Adelaide,"Just give it a try and enjoy all it has to offer. What ever you think you might like it will be there. Cheese to die for breads to make you fat!! Cakes and treats, it all there together."
281,Easter breakaway,If there was only one reaqson to visit Adelaide this would be it.Their is no reason when you are in Adelaide to miss this Market (the free bus stops outside) and you would be silly to do so.It has a fantastic range of fresh and local produce all under the one roof (as well as a very good Asian Food hall and Market).Cafes and Eateries abound and all the food is as fresh as the day it was picked and just as tasty.We usually have friends around for dinner when we visit and we purchase everything from here for our dinners as well as shop for fresh produce on a daily basis.Do yourself and your tastebuds a favor and go there.
282,Awesome experience,"Over the years the prices of the fruit and vegetables have been increasing to such an extent that it is not worth while to purchase hardly any at all.You can walk around and wonder why they charge so much.The quality is excellent.there are only two vendors that are a good price, 2 brothers I think they are called and another nearby. It is a experience though to check out all the continental stores who have a good variety of cheeses and continental products.You can judge when you go there."
283,A must do in Adelaide,We went to the market during the week very well looked after market with lots of variety of fruit and vegetables at good prices.lots of other specialty stalls also.walk around at your own pace.
284,Wow,"Icon of the city and better than many in larger cities as its all in one place and in the central CBD. Easily got to by tram and buses on the doorstep and carparking. Everything you can want in fresh food, casual eating and with other  restaurants in the vicinity in the arcade and China Town and Gouger street. Plenty of fruit, nut and veg stalls, baked goods, cheese and continental meats,meat,seafood, honey,wine, coffee and casual dining. Cooks delight."
285,Yummo with Cheryl,"Best of mafsydneytravels 2019*The best market - Adelaide Central Market, Adelaide*For gourmet food gastronomy, artisan breads, novelty shops and cafes"
286,Great Historic Market with Amazing Foods,"The raw ingredients available in South Australia, coupled with the worldwide influences that brings these ingredients to market, make this a wonderful experience. If you like food, plan on spending at least half a day."
287,Amazing food at great prices,"We went on a Saturday and didn’t realise it closes at 3pm so that was a tad disappointing, will go back again this week! What a busy food market! Lots of tasters and amazing smells. Certainly somewhere to visit when in Adelaide, even if you don’t intend on buying anything it’s a interesting experience to walk round!"
288,Fantastic market!,"Busy with lots of things to do, taste, see and smell, only problem I found is it’s not very wheelchair friendly and most people are wheelchair oblivious!! Or just don’t care and I’m too low down to get served efficiently 🙄🙄 good thing I was with family"
289,Must visit Adelaide Central Markets ,There are lots to see in the market. It has many multi cultural food under the one roof. Also have lots of fresh produce available.
290,Fresh food shopping - Everything you could ask for!,"Possibly we went at the wrong time of year and a bit late in the day , a lot of stalls were closed or not operating , things we had heard about weren’t available but still worth a look and I’m sure after the holiday period and earlier in the day it would have been better"
291,Best food market in the world ,"Central market is located within city. You can reach there via free tram and nearest tram station is Victoria square. There are shops for everything from vegetables, fruits, seafood, livestock then some eateries. Fresh items available at cheap price. It's open throught the week ex eot on sunday and Monday. Friday is the most happening day with all shops open and market is open till 9pm."
292,fun place,"I've been to a few markets in Australia. Adelaide's a little different. It's slightly bigger than most. They have all types of stuffs ranging from freshly baked bread, meat, nuts, fruits, cakes & chocolates. Very interesting I must say. 1 of the recommended place to visit if you are travelling especially if you are staying in an apartment where you can cook"
293,A jewel,"Having a lot of variety also reflects a variety of prices. We found that quality is at the higher end of the pricing scale as it should be, but there were several cases of good quality at a good price. To find this you need to do a bit of walking and observe the product quality on offer."
294,Amazing Variety!,So Incredible with such a huge variety of stores. The only bit that is holding it back from being perfect is the amount of stores that do not accept credit cards and only accept cash.
295,An assault on the senses,"Green grocers, butchers, bakers, confectioners, and florists...it’s all here. Plus there are some amazing food stalls with local and international fare. One stall even cooks up a gigantic pan of Paella each day at 1230."
296,Good fun,"I spend a lot of time in Adelaide with work, and cater for myself 75% of the time. All of my food comes from the market. So does the cheese but that's another story. Dry aged Beef is my weakness, and so far I haven't been disappointed. Did I mention the Cheese? Fruit and Veg are fresh, just take your time and select what you're happy with, great variety. And the Cheese........."
297,Food heaven,I grew up in Adelaide in the 50's and 60's and I remember my parents and I driving into the Adelaide Markets on a Friday night to buy up bulk apples and other fruit and veg. Having now lived in Perth for nearly 40 years I have just returned to Adelaide and visited the Adelaide Markets again. In all those years the markets have only got better. The astounding amount and variety of fruit and vegetables is overwhelming. It's such a treat to wander around and take in all the different foods including chocolates and coffees and wines and cakes as well as exotic fruits and vegetables. There are also second hand bookshops which my husband enjoyed.
298,Fortnightly visit,We visisited not really knowing what to expect the variety of food fruit and vegetables was amazing Also the amazing different local cheeses I just wish I was staying longer to try more
299,Brilliant place!,"If it hadn’t been for Cheryl we would have not had the experience that we did. If you had walked into the markets and weren’t a local we could have purchased things that we wouldn’t have been able to take to our next destination, WA. She was amazing with her knowledge and we tasted yummy things. A must do. You in SA are so lucky to have such awesome produce on your doorstep."
