0,Nice Temple,"An ancient temple situated in the fort premises. Quite a trek to get to the temple, but worth seeing as you get to see the ruins of the wonderful fort. Definately worth a visit during your stay at Ranthambore."
1,Divine,An ancient temple of Ganesh within the Fort. A long walk from the entrance of the temple but well worth it with its lovely views of the National Park with crocodiles basking in the sun.
2,Ganpati Bappa Morya.....,Though the flight of steps leading up to the Ganesh Temple is tiring but visiting the ancient temple is worth the effort.
3,excellent views,"This is a must visit place at Ranthambore. Not very difficult to hike up to the Fort. This place has Hindu temples, Jain temples,Dargah, a beautiful garden. There is small Shiva temple tucked below a large structure near the entrance at the top of the hill, do not miss it. Offers wonderful panaromic views of zone 3 of the Ranthambore National Park. You can easily spend 2-3 hrs here. Great place to see, beware of monkeys and langurs here though.."
4,Worth a visit,"We visited here during visit to Ranthambore Fort. The temple is a rather long walk from the entrance and is part of the fort. The temple is nice, peaceful and calm, and the exterior walkways are hounded by tame monkeys. A must visit place if you are visiting the fort. It is said that the statue of deity here is completely natural."
5,Good experience,"It is up the Ranthambore fort- worth a visit for the enjoyable trek up the hill. The temple itself is nothing spectacular or unusual. Avoid carrying sweets or eatables as this can attract monkeys, although they dont do any harm usually."
6,Unique temple,"The temple is located in the heart of the Fort. You have to climb a lot to get to it. But, on the way, you will realize it is revered by locals. Bow your head & have the prasad. The outside of the temple has monkeys & langurs.If you've any kind of food in your hand, they'll try to snatch it from you. Right outside the temple, you can get refreshments as well as offerings for the deity."
7,In the Wild!,"Situated at the end of Ranthambore fort, it's a long hike to the temple. Surrounded by may be a ton of monkeys, they stare right at you, making a poker face. Try not to take any eatables in front of them, surely will get snatched. A peaceful place it is, being a hindu devotee it…"

19,"Holy place, respect of tradition","It was a trekking for us. Had to climb a lot for Ganesh temple. The fort is surrounded with a lot of monkeys. Do not carry any food items along with you while climbing the fort. The darshan was good, we couldn’t eat the prasad As the monkeys took the entire ladoo box from our hand. While going back one monkey jumped on a car next to ours and broke the front glass of the car. Not recommended to take your private car to this place."
20,Ganesh Temple on Top of Fort,"The temple is said to be of ancient origin. A small temple but people seem to have immense faith in it. Crowded with langurs who are eager to snatch edibles from you.As you approach the temple, you will notice innumerous small small stone assemblies.. these are the structures people make here wishing for the materialisation of their house dreams..The surroundings for sure can be better maintained and cleaner."
21,lord ganesha,Very nice temple. It is situation in the fort. Requires some effort to reach though. About 250 steps and a long walk in the fort. Keep about 2 to 2.5 hours to so this leisurely.

25,Beautiful,Divine experience here .. must visit after your safari ... huge fort with the Divine Ganeshji Temple .. loads of monkeys .. fun trip
26,Memorable,"One of its kind. Must visit to seek blessings. The temple idol is very ancient and is linked to royalty and fort.Hire a guide for rs. 500, worth a walk to soak in history of India."
27,Holy Ganesha,This temple is located in the ranthambore fort. Around 1 km walk to reach the temple. Walk is a bit tiring. Lot of langurs on the way to reach the temple. Ranthambore fort is not in a good condition as there is no maintenance.
28,Beautiful  ganesh temple,The temple is situated in the fort. It takes half an hour to reach there by foot and there is no any option to go there by any vehicle but its worth it for such a holy place.
29,Memorable vist to fort,This temple is situated on top of Ranthambore fort and it is a 30-40 minute trek. Best time to do the trek is early morning or late evening as it was get really hot during the afternoon. 
30,Must place to visit!!,Ganesh temple is very revered. Takes around half an hour to reach the top of the temple on foot. Temple is on the way to tiger safari. Everyone says that If you see white rat in the temple your all wish are come true.Be aware of the black monkeys.
31,"Connect with famity tree, historical ",It will take around 20-30 minutes climb/ walk to reach the temple. The temple is in the fort. And to reach the fort you have to go either in private car or hire a car (ricks not allowed). You can take share Jeep available at station. If you take a hired care it's very costly. You can try to merge the temple with Safari but you will have to walk atleast 2-3 km in jungle to reach the fort.
32,Lovely place,"It is located in the Khandar Fort itself. About 30 min walk, one has to climb 200 stairs to reach the temple, lot of monkeys around but they are friendly. A good place to visit."
33,I love Lord Ganesha,The temple is located above the hills. it approx takes 1 hr to reach there. Good to walk in morning and evening. there are various other temples located on the way. The idol is different. Old Ganesha temple.
34,Different,climb and walk to the temple through the Ranthambore fort is an experience. Yes it is taxing to climb so many stairs but an experience in itself
35,Very Pleasant & Spiritual Place,The temple is situated inside the fort in the midst of the tiger sanctuary. The place is very much scenic and surrounded with troops of monkeys and herds of birds
36,Not recommended to take private car,"The temple itself is kind of disappointing, Great walking very interesting through the Fort but the temple itself is Very basic although supposedly it’s the most famous temple in India because it supposed to bring you good luck"
37,Great,Approach towards the fort Ranthambore is through the Jungle where you tend to see wild animals. Must visit
38,Amazing spiritual experience,"It's a must visit place if you are in Ranthambore.It is a temple made inside the fort.It is located inside the national park region and during the journey, you will find many wild animals. If lucky, you may see a tiger as well.The view of the pond from the top is amazing.The route is a bit tough due to uneven and long steps. Also the route is really hectic for the old people.If you are coming from the city than bring your own car or you will have to hire jeeps to go up and down the fort and still you have to walk a lot.Although the breathtaking view from the top kills the fatigue, but still I won't suggest it for the old people with high BP.Tip: Make sure you don't carry any colorful object with you due to monkey snatching on the route. Thousands of monkeys are there snatching items from tourists. Make sure to put your camera handy and sticky and don't click them by calling them out."
39,The temple itself is kind of disappointing,"Inside Ranthambhore Fort, this is the biggest attraction. Most people visit the fort for this temple. A number of monkeys around. They don't trouble you unless you do anything stupid. The arrangement for visitors is no different than any other similar Hindu temple. Look out for monkey art along the way similar to one attached."
40,Ancient temple in ranthambore fort.,This temple is located in the Ranthambore National Park. Approachable road is very scenic and adventures. As it is located in the FORT so you have to walk or climb some km. Lot of moneys around the temple so keep safe your belongings. Must see place in Sawai Madhopur.
41,nice to visit but only once,this temple is on the top of ranthambore fort. You will have to climb stairs to reach on top. There are guides who charge 200 INR. Its worth to hire a guide as they give you background and stories of fort
42,"Langoors on the way, Fort upon the hill, other temples around Ganesh Temple","A visit to Ganesh Temple is an excursion in itself which could easily take around 2 hr. Ganesh Temple is located in the Ranthambore Fort area. You need to climb 300 odd steps to reach the Ranthambore Fort and further a km or two to reach the Ganesh Temple. The Ranthambore Fort lies in the National Park  itself, journey was fantastic. Its a point worth considering since wildlife are in abundance in this area, and Tigers are also known to roam around here.  The walk to Ganesh Temple will also showcase some other smaller temples, a pond, a mosque and a galore of Langurs (white monkeys). The Temple is famous since this is known to be the only temple where Lord Ganesh resides with both his wives (Riddhi & Siddhi) and Sons"
43,amazing fort and lord Ganesha,This temple sits atop of Ranthambor forte. One has to climb about 250 steps to reach the temple. It is only in this temple that Ganesh ji is seen with his whole family - 2 wives named Riddhi & Siddhi and 2 sons named Shubh & Labh.
44,Nice temple,"This temple is situated around a fort and is the only temple in india in a sense that if you want to post any thing , you just need to write Ganesh Mandir and it will reach this temple in sawai madhopur. Like the 1st wedding card invitation in some religions are sent here for well wishes"
45,Nice view of the city From Fort,"The Ganesh temple is situated inside tge ranthambore fort, and u need to hike a bit to reach there.

51,God of the jungle,The journey to temple in itself a great experience which involves passing through jungle and then reaching the fort where we walked up to visit the trinetra ganesh temple.

61,Only temple of lord ganesha alongwith shubh & labh,A very nice trek to start with. Place is very calm and nice. Awesome view of Jaipur city from top. Worth the trek. But priest was least interested in sharing the details/history of this place.

72,Ancient Temple,"This temple is very famous in the locals. The temple is on the top of the fort. There are a lot of money roaming near the temple for the prasad. If you are visting this place in summer, it is better to go there early in the morning to avoid summer heat."
73,A walk to remember,It's a good and famous temple. A guide will try to make up lot of stories but I personally feel it is not much required. Difficult for elderly ppl and very young kids as lots of stairs need to climb to reach the top. On the way lots of places to see specially lake from above…
74,Really Nice Place,"Good climb from parking lot and there are many temples but the Trinetra Ganesh Temple is where the devotees are heading.Guides can be hired too and for those who cannot climb, palkies are there to helpWas not crowded on Friday when we were there so we had a good darshanSmall eateries outside temple to help you satisfy the hunger pangs!!!Jai Ganesh!!"

78,Best tamale in India ,We happened to go during a festival. The view from the top of the fort is amazing. There are also monkeys everywhere! There were little shops at the top where you could buy trinkets at local prices. Not sure if that is an everyday occurrence or just during festivals.
79,**The Elephant Deity Beckons you in the wild **,Went early in the morning to visit the temple.  Lovely walk up lots of stairs to a stunning view over the forrest and lake.  While there visit the Shiva linga in a small cave as well.  The monkeys love to eat the garlands there so be aware and surrender them quickly

86,Ancient temple ,Beautiful temple great history must visit place. It has a lot of history behind it and is said to be the only temple with Lord ganeshas family.

88,Jai Ganesh,Luckily we had a guide to Ranthambhore Fort which made it very interesting. Although I have knee trouble I didn't find the walk to the Temple too difficult.

94,need to be tough enough to climb 200 steps,It is temple inside the Temple and is revered by local folks. It is good up hill walk to the temple but worth the effort.
95,A special temple atop a hill and inside a fort,This is a very famous and powerful temple in this area and people in this area come to seek blessings from Lord Ganesh.

109,3 netra Ganesh Temple,We visited this great devotional place today evening. It was worth visiting. This temple is very very famous and lots of people follow this temple religiously. The temple is situated inside Ranthambhor Fort. You have to climb about 200 steps and about 2.00km walking to reach this place.Be aware of monkeys as they can grab any eatery from your hand.Do note the The timing ; you must start from Sawai madhopur by lately 4.00pm because you have to come back out of forest before 6:00 pm. Parking is very big problem.. As road to Fort from town is very narrow.
110,Great temple within the Ranthambore fort,"absolutely not to be missed, climb up the fort and visit the temple, very good experience will definitely recommend specially in the good weather"
111,Very interesting historical and religious site,For hindus its a place for religious sentimental. Highly recommended place for families to go there and spend some quality time there.
112,"Top of the fort, confusing information from guide",Such an amazing view once you reach the temple. Feeding the langurs chanas was a nice experience. The langurs are pretty people friendly and not aggressive like we normally see.
113,Temple in the fort.,"The Temple is situated in fort on top & location is good to see the some part of the fort ,also there is refreshment facility with Peacock and Black money all around but are safe until you are showing any eatable thing to them."

123,Must visit place.. during Ranthambore trip,"A beautiful view of Ranthombore can be seen from the top of the Ganesh Temple. We received a lovely Hindu blessing at the top and saw lots of monkeys. We hired a guide for 750rupees and he was worth every penny, without him we would have either gotten lost or not understood about the temple itself. Apparently when it is hottest most of the water reserves dry up and tigers will drink from the large water reserve visible from the top so sightings are very likely at the hottest times of the year. Absolutely stunning scenery, a lovely place to go whilst travelling from Agra to Jaipur!"
124,If you visit Ranthambhore Fort then do the extra walk to Ganesh Temple,It is a long trek and there are lots of monkeys there. Once up you will feel good and the views are also nice from multiple places while climbing up.
125,Famous temple at ranthambore fort,"The fort is old and very difficult to navigate. Climbing skills are a necessity. The fort is very high and many, many steps to get there."
126,Wonderful drive,Trinetra Ganesh Temple is located inside the Ranthambore fort and one has to walk for at least 30 mins inside the fort to reach the temple. What i liked the most is the drive inside the forest area to the fort as i could spot a lot of flora and fauna.
127,Religious place,"This is in Zone 3 and very near to territory of tigers. There is a gate in between anyhow. We spotted two tigers just near the gate, which is close to the temple."
128,Awsme place to visit in mornings ( Just beware of Monkey! ),I have visited with my husband after marriage.I loves the temple which is situated at the top of the Ranthambhore Fort.I feel lucky to be there.Thanks
129,Only TriNetra Ganesh Temple,Our photography group did a model shoot up at the fort and temple so it was a wonderful ancient backdrop.  Beautiful place to be in late afternoon light and sunset.
130,An ancient temple crowded with langurs,Beautiful small temples with lot of belief in same. Located inside ranthambore fort. All together a different experience. One of the 25 temples and 1 Dargah inside the fort. Heard that it's quite crowdy during festivities and people walk down miles to reach it. Need to walk…
131,Jai Ganesh.. ,This temple is well known in India. People start all there good things after visiting here. I have been lucky to visit this and spent time at the Temple. Felt so relaxed after visiting this place.God is Great.
132,Long walk,"Visited Ganesh temple in Ranthambore fort, it was a hot day but we enjoyed the walk upto the temple, came across lots of monkeys and langoors and were blessed ."
133,Ganesh Temple at Rathambor,"We were very unsure to visit the Trinetra Ganesha Temple whic is part of the Ranthambore fort. We were told that there are 530 steps to reach the temple and it take quite some time, well some of this is true but some of it isn't. We were convinced by our resort staff to visit the temple as he felt strongly about us missing somehting important, well! we did not regret it. The temple is some distance up in the fort but the mini hike isn't bad at all. If you can manage to do this in the early hours of the morning, you will really enjoy stepping up to the fort, the view and of course the temple. We decided a bit late in the morning so got slightly tough with the heat but was still something worth visiting. The route to the fort is beautiful, the landscape is beautiful too but the fort is pretty average unless of course you have an eye for photography. If you are looking for blessings from Lord Ganesh, do not miss to visit."
134,Ganesh Temple Visit,It was ausome to pay visit to  Ganesh Temple at Ranthambhore. It was nice to see such huge temple in the fort premises having large followers. Upon Darshan you get solance and achieve the sense of contentment and fulfillment.Very large fort area with lot og monkeys ready to grab the flower garlands you got back from puja in temple. However I was luck to save.my garland from the view and clutches of these monkeys. Overall quite satisfy visit . You need to climb about 200 steps to reach the temple.
135,Excellent view must visit once..,It is one of the most famous Ganesh Temples in the region. Situated at top of the ancient fort built on a mountain. It is said that it is very auspicious to invite Swaimadhopur Ganesh ji as first guest in marriage :) Also said that those who are not getting married must do his…
136,Nice place,"you need to climp up to reach the ganesh temple in ranthambore which is really revered. on a cool day, the walk itself is quite rewarding. must visit."

Outside the temple, there are number of monkeys, but they do not harm anyone. A great place of worship with nice views from the top."
138,"A spritual place, Lord Ganesha's old temple","Ganesh Temple is situated in the Ranthambore fort. 25 min  by walk up apox 200 steps and then walk apox 1 km with heritage /archaeological structures/monuments  enroute- . Also you can have good picturesque view of Ranthambore park from top of the fort. Take a binocular if u have.The only temple you will find the idol of Lord Ganesh, Riddhi Siddhi (his wife) and two sons (Shub Labh) along with the idol of mushak (mouse, his vehicle). You will find lot of monkeys on the way to the temple- they are harmless if you don't tease. Best time to visit is in morning in summers."
139,Must visit Trinetra Ganesh ji Temple,"Not worth the trip...stop to visit if near-by. Not much to see around the temple. If lucky a tiger may stroll by. Lots of antilopes, deers, monkeys, pigs, crocodiles nearby and around the temple."
140,Great temple,This is a really well known temple with people coming from all around.  We organised to go up with a guide and met so many locals going up or making a pilgrimage to the top.  We went into the temple and had a blessing.   An amazing place to get to see real Indian life.
141,Worth visiting,The temple is located on the top end of the Ranthambore fort premises and is about a half and hour hike from the main entrance. We had gone in a group of 41 and the seniors in the group were really interested in seeing the temple. It's a beautiful walk through the fort ruins and…
142,Active small temple ,"I have always wondered about the location of this Ancient Trinetra  Ganesh Temple, situated in the Ranthambore fort. I enjoy the long trek, through the fort up on the hillock, and the view of the Tiger Sanctuary is mesmerizing from the top. The Fort is grand in all ways. The walk is the major attraction for me followed by Beautiful Darshan, the Calm , the Beauty , the freshness in  air and  is a relief.A word of caution here - The temple is situated far,  its steep at places  , will not advice you to  go on full stomach, trek difficult for the elderly, young kids might throw a tantrum to walk that far, the weather if its summer- prefer going early morning, the place has many clans of Monkeys which sit comfortably all over the shops near temple, keep edibles tucked in .  Sipping  Water is a good bet. Walking shoes a must..If you can brave all this, Lord Ganesha showers you with love and blessings, yummy laddoos, the pics  clicked at the fort and temple can be memorable. Have enough time on hand to look around for beauty in flowers, stones, and local people."
143,Nice quaint temple inside the Fort,Historical place .. must see.. learn something from our history &  culture etc.here lord Ganesh Temple
144,"Great view, high devotion","We had an interesting ,if somewhat bumpy Safari into the beautiful park but the tigers are very elusive! If you want scenery this is the area to visit . If you want to see tigers go to your local zoo.  If you visit the beautiful Ganesh temple beware of the monkeys!,"
145,Not bad,Ganesh temple is inside the Ranthambhore national park area. It is a very nice statue of lord Ganesha.
146,good,We visited this place it has panaromic view and from the top of the fort we saw all jungle. It's really nice to visit all these places
147,Jai Trinetra Ganesh,The Ganesh Temple is the most popular place to visit in Sawaimadhopur (Rajasthan). This is situated in the middle of Ranthambhore Durg.
148,Nice though plan for time,V were lucky to visit this temple on our tour to Ranthambhore.. v came to know about this temple through our hotel people and guide which v hired for Ranthambore fort.. believe me that temple is worth visiting since it’s swayambhu murthy and has 3 eyes.. fort is also one of the main excursion there in which this temple is situated .. ppl say this temple is divine and has a power ..
149,So many monkeys! ,"It is the only temple which boasts of having ""triNetra Ganesh ji"" Walk and stairs of almost 1 km - it would take upto 25 minutes to reach from parking - Lots of friendly monkeys on the way Great experience - must visit"
150,Overrated Temple but good hike through fort,Old Ganesh temple!!! Lot many devotee goes to the temple. nice view!! you have to walk from main for at least 2km. but almost flat road from fort.toilet facility is there.
151,My Ganu Baba,"After climbing about 400 steps and some distance around beautiful lake and monument, you will be delighted to see this marvellous temple. Beautiful inner campus, blessing Lord Ganesh and deleciuos Laddu  Prasad ..every thing will give you a feeling of satisfaction. There are a…"
152,Nice place,"The best panoramic & scenic way of 5 KM to the temple and that is from the one of the most core area of National Park. This Temple is a part of Ranthambore fort and the fort is also having Shiv Temple, a Maszid, and many more ruins of fort along the way."
153,The Old Fort,"Situated in the Ranthambore Fort it is the only TriNetra Ganesh Temple. To reach here one has to trek/walk to the temple. It's a steep climb of about 250 odd steps. The outside of Temple is as usual commercialised. Lots of monkeys hang around here and snatch any food item's in sight.one cant take pics within the temple. Their is a belief that if you make a house with stones lying around, ones wish of having own house is fulfilled."
154,A Holy Place To Visit..!!,"Atop the Ranthambore Palace, this temple is very popular.A climb of 270 odd stairs, slowly and gradually we made it.Enjoyed the view and the serenity."
155,"Not well maintained, just go to visit the temple!",The visit to the temple is done with the visit to the Ranthambore fort . the entry has to be done before 5 pm. lot of climbing required but if you do not hurry it is enjoyable . lot of langurs are there and they try to snatch the prasad from you when you return after the Darshan in the temple.there was no rush at the temple .the scenery around the temple was breath taking.
156,The activity of pilgrimage and devotees is terrible to the wild life.,"This temple is inside the Ranthambore Fort. We went on Monday and there was hardly any crowd. Beware of the monkeys, they live in huge numbers near the temple and can snatch food items. The trek to temple is ok but can be tiring during in summer months."
157,Pretty tired walk all the way up and Nothing interesting ,Highly recommended. Beautiful walk and so much wildlife. If you want to see monkeys come here. Stunning 100 year old fort. No other westerners to be seen. There are some small shops at the top of the hill. Bathroom facilities exist. There are rubbish bins but the monkeys steal from them. Would not recommend leaving anything not biodegradable in the bins. The locals were amused to see us and a few groups asked for selfies with us. Entry is free and parking is nominal fee (I think 5 rupees.) Not wheelchair friendly (cobblestone path.)
158,Ganesh Temple@ranthambore,"Ganesh Temple was adjacent to the Forest / Ranthamboor National Park. One needs to climb a number of stairs to reach Ganesh Temple. There were 2-3 other small temples in between, while traversing the fort, towards the Ganesh Temple. There were Langoors on the way. Outside the Ganesh temple, one of the Langoor's held my right hand with his right hand and took eatables when I offered it. The fort area was mesmerizing and Ganesh Temple was spreading spiritual vibes. Overall experience was memorable."
159,Ganeshji Darshan with aweosme Sunset views from the top!,This is a very beautiful place and is situated in the Ranthambore national Park. Private vehicles are allowed there to visit and is a must visit place in Rajasthan! Best time is winters.
160,Worth the hike! ,Ganesh Temple is located in Ranthambore fort and attracts lots of devotees. This temple is surrounded by the hills and green forest and has lots of Langur Monkeys.You may visit this temple while visiting Ranthambore Fort.
161,Different,"Had to be visited whilst in the locality, would recommend the guide, he will help you with the history and actually having a go worshiping in the temple the monkey are amazing by the way!"
162,Ganesh Temple,"I enjoyed the small temple. We could enter, pray & receive blessings from the monks inside. It was Totally decorated for the all night solstice celebration on the day we visited. It’s worth going inside."
163,Interesting fort to walk up to. Shame about all the litter!,Trinetra Ganesh temple is situated at the last part inside the Ranthambore fort. One feel very sacred while visiting this temple. It is the biggest Trinetra Ganesh temple in Rajasthan. There are lots of monkeys and Langoor outside the temple but they will never bother you. This…
164,Hilltop divinity!,This is very important Hindu Temple of God Shri Ganeshji - People worship here with first card of their marriage and have faith in god for successful accomplishment of complete marriage ceremony.
165,Great walk,Thgsi temple is at the top of Hill. Many temples in the complex. Its inside the fort and has lot of stories attached to it.
166,Interesting and Different!,"If you are someone who worships Lord Ganesha, then you MUST visit, as they say this temple is the Headquarters and rest are just branches. It can get insanely crowded on occasions so ask your hotel guys the best time to visit."
167,The only temple in India of Ganesh ji with 3 eyes.,Temple is situated within Ranthambore Fort and is at the last of the fort. Temple is surrounded by lots of langoors so be cautious.
168,Long trek upwards,Good and religious place to visit. I suggest do not purchase the coconut and prasad from nearby shops as it is not good
169,nice temple,Temple is on one of the corner of the fort and one need to climb thru 200 steps and a 20-30 min walk... at temple you may witness many baboons willing to have selfie with you in return of a favour in terms of something to eat... be visible and do not carry anything eatable openly in hands
170,Part of fort,After climmbing about 200 steps you reach to the temple its pretty nice in the fort imagine how could a large fort like this above the hills with such large walls could have been made at that time .
171,The only Trinetra Ganesh Temple in India,"Ganesh Temple is inside the Ranthambore Fort, it will take a approx 30-40 mins from the bottom to reach the main Temple , but it was always worth to visit Ganesh Temple, beware of monkeys at the template if you have small kids with you.  Ganesh Temple inside Fortress in Rajasthan is a tradition."
172,Managers picnic ,Must visit place in RTR; IF YOU believe in God than visit the temple it's very peaxeful and soothing experience
173,Lord ganesha,"Visit to Ganesh temple is more of tracking then religious. After so many steps, mesmerizing beauty of the lake below and remains of fort, visit to temple is the mind freshening thing. The purity of air and darshan of god gives you soothing effect."
174,Holy Place,Nothing much to do other than trek your way to the temple! The fort around it isnt well maintained and nothing else to do there.
175,Good location,It was one of best temple i see entire lord ganesh family we can find here. Lots of mouses running there while mouse we saw there.
176,Superb temple,"Though I am not a very religious person, but I liked this place because of its scenic views and natural approach. The way is not tough, bit of walking is required to reach the temple. Localittes believe this place to be sacred and they also have faith in the God. Here they even say that if you build house by placing small rocks like a house, you will be able to get your own house soon."
177,"Ganesh Temple , the only one in India","Temple is located inside the Ranthambore Fort and is one of the top attraction in Ranthambore. Feels nice once you get the Darshan. Lot of monkeys around, and you can feed them ( friendly once )"
178,Nice temple,The way to temple is starting same when we go to Ranthambore national park.today because of diwali around 2 lakh people comes.it is the only temple in world along with full family of lord Ganesha at one place.must sight to visit.
179,ganesh temple,Very old temple...almost more than 1000 yrs old.. You can see lot of langoors outside temple. You can give them chana & they come without hurting u and eat from your hands
180,Darshan at Lord ganesha,This temple is unique as it has Riddhi & Siddhi also along with Lord Ganesh. One has to trek after entering parking of Ranthambore National Park. The temple is surrounded by Langurs. We held some nuts in our hand to feed them and they were peaceful enough to eat them one by one from our hand. Was fun indeed!!
181,interesting place,"Used to be territory of Ustad, a tiger. pilgrims favourite place during full moon as they get a chance to walk through the jungle."
182,Nice temple,"The manager suggests us to visit Ranthambore fort and provide us jeep for that , the fort had different art of building you will find all history stone in fort . You can recognise the long history of war. There was temple of Ganesh is only temple of Ganesha with three eyes . We pry for our  good future and blessing."
183,Fort Temple,"If you are in Ranathambhaur then you must visit.We had our own vehicle but parking is about 5 kms away. From main gate or parking point  You need to walk 5 kms or take sharing jeep for another 3 kms. But even though you have  to climb and walk for another 2 kms. Many monkeys are on the way but they don't harm anyone. Sharing jeep are not comfortable because the push more than 10 passengers in one jeep. They charge ₹ 15/- per passenger. You can hire a reserved jeep taxi by paying ₹150/- which will be more comfortable. After reaching at temple, you will feel relaxed and blessed."
184,Revered by locals,"About 30 min hike , excellent lake view from mid point . In 1300 AD King Hammer built this temple of lord Ganesha at Ranthambore fort ."
185,"The only Ganesh ,its temple very High Devotional and Papular","An excellent alternative to the Safari's offered in the park . Amazing views of the national park enroute the temple once inside the fort ,this temple uniquely receives the first wedding invitation from the entire region and has a large delivery of wedding cards daily to lord ganesh. Also the annual parikrama is performed by thousands . However this is a bad time to visit certain routes in the park that have masses of people walking towards and around the fort which means you will most likely see nothing in terms of wildlife sighting in those areas"
186,Beautiful tri Netra temple,"Place of historical importance, one of it's kind temple where Ganesh ji is with his complete family, Ridhi Siddhi and shubh laabh"
187,Temple in Fort,"Trinetra Ganesha Temple is located in Ranthambore Fort. The temple is a must visit for all visitors of Tiger Sanctuary who believe in spritual powers of Lord Ganesha and want his blessings, but one should not imagine about a well built, well managed temple. Go with open mind for attacking monkeys, running rats, watery garbage etc etc. Most of our pilgrimage places have the same scene, so no one is to blame for this except we the believers ourselves."
188,"The fort, the colours, the people, WOW",yes this temple is a part of fort. ma y mouse and monkey were there. we feed them. temple is located on top of fort to reach there we need to cross approx 250 stairs.
189,Old & renowned ganesh temple in ranthambore,The fort and the temple are majestic! No words...Just some unique dip in unexplored history! Recommended for cold weather..
190,One of the ancient temples.,"It is 15-20 min walk from the park gate. Be prepared to walk some steep stairs and pavments. you will sight many langur's on the way and for most part they are harmless, but you need to be careful if they see you carrying food.The temple is beautiful and we did not have to wait in a que to get in.. i am told that there are looong ques to get in during festivals. Th temple is famous for Ganesh Idol which has three eyes.. the only place in the world.( to be validated, as told by the tour guide). But just go there for the lords blessing. The lake view from the top is amazing and we worth the climb."
191,must visit,The fort & temple at Ranthambore are quite magical. It's a very steep clime of 350 steps up but worth the effort. The views over the national park are breathtaking if the the remains of the fort don't impress you. But its a good rambling walk trying to conjure up what a…
192,Visit Ganesh Temple,"Ganesh Temple is situated in the Ranthambore  fort. Known as very powerful deity, large number of devotees come here to seek blessings and fulfill their wish. In this temple you will find  the idol of Lord Ganesh, Riddhi Siddhi (his wife) and two sons (Shub Labh) along with the idol of mushak (mouse, his vehicle).  You will find lot of monkeys on the way to the temple, but if you do not disturb them, you can walk quietly."
193,Worth a visit,"The speciality of the ranthombore fort (2nd largest fort of rajasthan), this is situated inside the national park full of tiger leopard sloth bear and other wild animals, so walking in such a place is a thrilling experience.We had visited the place in june during our wild life safari at ranthombore, the atmosphere was too hot so we cannot make up our mind whether we go there or not, outside hotel atmosphere is giving burning sense at skin, at 4.30 we decided finally to go, quickly call a jeep (800 Rs is the regular charge). This is in the same way to the national park in front of the entry point of zone3. On the way we find lots of spotted deer, sambar, birds etc. our jeep driver show the place where T24 (ustad) kill one forest guard.We reach the place at 5pm, there was a ride of about 250 steps, but the walk is easy, lots of monkeys and peacock was around, there are many spot inside fort like, naulakha gate, jain temple, rani haveli, old tomb, battis khamba, anannya purna temple and trinetra jain temple. Guides are charging 500 Rs, in my suggestion no need to take guide everything is mention on board, I do bargain where guide ready to take us in 200 Rs. No entry fee for the fort.Lots of small rock made home was there, as per myth those who made small hose there will be owner of a real home in future life, so we made it also and my little daughter enjoyed a lot.Camera and mobile not allowed inside Ganesh temple, the temple was built by rana hammeer once he got a victory over Muslim ruler alauddin khilji. View of sanctuary from the top of fort is marvellous, zone 3 is very well visible, but you need a good binocular to watch animals, as this place is inside sanctuary not advisable to stay after sunset, temple was close by 7pm,"
194,Different Idol as compared to other Ganesh idols in india,The place is beautiful worth to go the view is very beautiful from the fort you can see all the century nice atmosphere the temple was ok Nothing interesting
195,Temple,"This Ganesh MAndir is more than 700 years old and famous in entire Rajasthan. The first invitation for all the marriages is being sent to this temple for inviting lord Ganesha so that entire celebration completed without any hurdle. On the eve of Ganesh Chaturthi a huge fair celebrated in this temple in which more than 5 lakhs person visit this place. Near the temple you can see the monkey, parrot and other birds."
196,divine with spicing of heritage,Walked up to the top of the fort . Some dramatic walls ramparts and scenery ...but appalling litter everywhere! The Ganesh temple floor  was covered in rubbish....and you were asked to take your shoes off! Not a temple of interest to the tourist...but obviously sacred to the…
197,Must visit place,"This is the Ganesha Temple situated inside the tail end of the Ranthambhore Fort at Swaimadhopur. This temple is one where Tri-netra (With three eyes) Lord Ganesha is seen with family, he is accompanied with Ridhi and Sidhi. A must visited place for tourists."
198,divinity atop the mountain,"This is the Ganesha Temple situated inside the tail end of the Ranthambhore Fort at Swaimadhopur.Visit to Ganesh temple is more of tracking then religious. After a long walk, mesmerizing beauty of the lake and forest below and remains of fort, visit to temple is the mind freshening thing."
199,Jai Shri Ganesh Ji Maharaj,"Visited while end of Rajasthan tour, located at Ranthambore Fort, there is few more temple in near by place, Ganesh mandir has timings for visit inside,"
200,Send an Invitation Letter to Lord Ganesha at Trinetra Ganesh Temple,What an amazing jewel in the midst of the park. Lovely to see monkeys and humans in co existence. nice walk to top to see temple
201,Inside Ranthambore fort,its nice and peaceful and beautiful temple. we need to cross approx 250 setps to reach at temple. Lots of monkeys are their.
202,Steep walk but worth it!,"The surroundings are the things that will make the trip worth remembering. The temple as it is, is nothing worth mentioning. Though this is known to be a very religious place in the entire country."
203,Family tour,"This is located in the forest region on top of the Ranthambore fort, which was built by a Chauhan ruler, although the exact name of the ruler is disputed. A widely held belief states that the fort was built the reign of Sapaldaksha, in 944 CE. In 1300 AD, King Hammer built a temple of Lord Ganesh. You can travel by Car or vehicle till car parking zone. Then you have to walk up the fort. About 250 steps. Then you reach the top of the fort. There are various temples ( Hanuman Ji, Ram ji, Maa Anapurna, Jain temple and many more 25 odd) located on top. Walk around 1 km and reach the famous temple is the Trinetra Ganesh ji Temple. He placed the idol of Lord Ganesh, Riddhi Siddhi (his wife) and two sons (Shub Labh) along with the idol of mushak (mouse, his vehicle)There are mainly five types of aartis taking place every day in this well known temple – Prabhat Aarti (early morning aarti), Sringar Aarti at 9 am, Bhog at 12 noon, Sandhaya Aarti during Sunset (6:30 in the Summer and 5:45 in the winters)People make small houses with 5 stones on the fort. This is done by those praying for a house of their own. It is believed that Ganesh ji blesses all with a home who make such small houses. The trip from car parking to back should take 2 hours.  This is a lovely place to visit for historical site as well as to earn some punya."
204,Olad is gold,Myself and my husband got the opportunity to visit this famous Ganesh Temple which is highly auspicious for newly weds to pray. 
205,Great find,"Must go there if you are traveling to RTR, you will anyways go to Fort and the temple is at the end of the fort, the view is pristine."
206,Get ready for tracking ,got to see many langurs on way to temple. don't carry prasad from temple in open or langurs will snatch and may cause injury.
207,Ganeshji visit,"To reach this place,  it takes atleast 20-30 by foot on stairs.  Nice view from the top.  You visit ganesh temple which has priests and can buy prasad also there.  Great place worth a visit. "
208,Jai Ganesh Deva,last month I visited Ganesh temple with my family there is so peaceful place I come to Ganesh temple every two or three months likely I I am very happy when I come to Ganesh temple we worshipped Shri Ganesh ji and eat food near the temple very tasty food very peaceful place I am so happy to tell you about the Ganesh temple that you must come to Ganesh temple and enjoy your life.
209,Perfect honeymoon visit,Lovely location with breathtaking views around! The entire Ranthambore fort area is an experience! Warning: Be wary of the zillion monkeys!
210,Anicent temple at ranthambhore fort,"You drive your car to the Ranthambore fort parking but you should be a good driver otherwise take share jeep from the gate (5 km) You have to walk 1.5 kms up in the stairs inside the fort to reach the temple, nice experience"
211,Ganesh Temple on the top of Ranthambore,Lovely collection of temples along with the famous Ganesh temple. There are 2 Shiv temples & a Kali temple too. Felt really nice & better to go early mornings.
212,memorable experience ,"This temple is said to be a temple of Dwapar Yuga. People offer first invitation of their marriage to Lord Ganesha here. It is also said that invitation of Lord Krishna's marriage was submitted here. This is the only temple where Lord Ganesh is with Shubha, Laabh, Riddhi and Siddhi means whole congregation. Temple is said to be the head office of Lord Ganesha other temples considered to be the branch offices. :PWay of the temple is through the Ranthambore fort which has its own history. King Hammirdeva of Ranthambore gave the asylum to rebel commander of Ala ud din Khilji which no one could even dare in the dream. King Hammirdeva was so adamant that just because of asylum given by him Ranthambore was surrounded and attacked by Khilji. Queens had to do Jauhar. Still he was unshakeable from his decision. That is why in our history it is said that हठ  हो  तो  हमीर  हठ |"
213,Awesome Place to visit Must go,The ganesh temple is inside the ranthambore fort which is a world heritage site. The fort is itself magnificent and the temple lies in the far end of the fort which was a pleasant journey.
214,Darshan for Ganshji,Very old temple but filthy and dirty really sad. It is a heritage site and very poorly maintained  no cleanliness also The give should and must ensure it is clean A blot on our country
215,Beware of monkeys!,"Well, obviously the temple itself is revered and beautiful! But like most temples, the cleanliness outside is abysmal and the hordes of monkeys are threatening."
216,Nice place,"On the top of the imposing Ranthambore fort amidst the forests is the ‘Trinetra Ganesh Temple’. We preferred taking the car in till the parking while we saw locals walking. This fort stands impressively atop a hill overlooking the entire park and the view gets better and better as you go up. The fort has seven gates to cross before one reaches the top to the temple. Many animals and birds could be seen at the eye level, specially monkeys, langurs and peacocks. Best to visit in the morning hours. It would take some time and effort climbing up but totally worth the efforts. Some sign boards also show information from history. The place is well maintained.We got to know some interesting facts about this temple –1. The idol has three eyes and has appeared on its own.2. It is believed that if you make a house with stones in front of the temple, you will soon have a house of your own. And there are actually many such houses there. We built one too.3. In many castes in India, the first wedding invitation card is usually sent to this temple to invite lord Ganesha and seek his blessings."
217,An interesting climb,Quite a climb to the top but the views make it worth it. We had a guide who was able to give us the history.
218,Lovely drive,"Often the devotees and casual visitor offers edible stuff to the Langoors,birds, cows and others which is not their natural food. The hoard like beggars for free food. This is terrible."
219,A good place to see,"The 3 eyed Ganesh idol that seems to be a Syambhu as per myth is 6500 years old. The temple though is infested with Langoors outside that cause a havoc. Avoid carrying eatables openly for the risk of being attacked. The temple claims to fulfil the wishes of the devotees who build stone houses with pebbles on the path to the temple, but the journey is arduous and is above the fort"
220,Lovely setting,Beautiful  old temple  of ganesh. One of the oldest  ganesh temple in ranthambore .it is one of the ganesh temple  near national  park  and lots of devotees comes every day to visit this  temple
221,Temple in a fort,"We were in national park for three days and after seen two tigers we prefered to visit fort instead another game drive.It was nice visit and we did not regret it. The temple is authentic place, not reconstructed so it does not seem commercial visit like Tajmahal for exemple.There were only few tourist around rather local people who can be pretty pushing and curious so it is good if you have some local giude with you."
222,For the religious minded,"In our family tree, had been inviting Ranthambore fort Ganesh ji since ages. Got change to visit them for the first time. Very nice , nostalgic connect. Very nice temple."
223,also known as chitthi wale ganesh and havving third eye,Great place and view. Superb Tracking. Much recommended place during Ranthambore visit. Don't miss it.
224,The Tiger of Sawai Madhopur,good walk up the fort but lotta monkeys so be careful with food items / chips in ur hand. senior citizens/ knee problems/ handicapped may not b able to climb.

227,So pretty,Very beautiful temple with great view. Monkey all around and we given nuts to them. When we entered in temple feel energy.
228,dilapidated inspite of being labelled World Heritage site,The Ganesh temple is located in the 3rd Zone of the Ranthambore National park. Its inside the fort on the hill top. The road to the fort passes through forest. The lake on the way to the fort is full of crocodiles and can spot the crocs on the way to the fort. There are plenty of peacocks in the fort and can click the pics with the peacocks.Its not suitable for senior citizens as have to climb the stairs to reach the fort.
229,Good experience ,Its is awesome place for piece and very awesome weather on evening you must go to visit there is lots of temple form different different religious.there is lots of monkeys also........
230,Only temple with 3-eyed Lord Ganesha,We were on a managers picnic trip.. we have visited the temple in the morning.we had seen lord Ganesh... it was fantastic trip.
231,Jai Shree Ganesh,"My friend Vasant and me were fortunate to have a pleasant darshan of Lord Trinetra Ganesh at Ranthambhore Fort at 0845 on 18th June 2018 . This is the only temple in the world where Ganesh presides with his entire family consisting of his two consorts , Riddhi & Siddhi ; two sons , Shubh & Labh and his wahan  Mushak . We attended one of the five Aaratis , Shringar Aarati sung in the praise of the Lord at 0900 . Other four Aaratis are Prabhat Aarati  at 0600 , Bhog Aarati at Noon , Sandhya Aarati during Sunset i e at 1830 in Summer & at 1745 in Winter  and Shayan Aarati at 2000 daily . In Rajasthan Wednesday is considered Ganesh’s day , so on that day a Special Aarati is offered to the Lord .We were told that in 1299 AD , a war broke out between Chauhan King Hameer of Ranthambhore Fort and Sultan Alauddin Khilji of Delhi and the fort was fortified . As the war prolonged , the stored things in godowns were depleted . King Hameer was a great devotee to God Ganesh . One night when he was sleeping , Lord Ganesh appeared in his dream and said that all the stock would be replenished next day morning . Next day morning , an idol of Lord Trinetra  Ganesh emerged  from one of the walls of the fort and the stocks were replenished . As a gratitude King Hameer built the temple of Lord Trinetra Ganesh in 1300 AD ."
232,Good Temple,1200 years old temple of Lord Ganesha and the Idol has 3 Eyes...  The Idol is swayambhu...  And DivineAll your wishes comes to  true on worshipping him.
233,Nice temple but beware of langoors,This temple is special because here Lord ganesha have 3 eyes and resides with full Family that is riddhi siddhi and children shubh and labh
234,Chamatkari Temple,"Trinetra Ganesh Temple situated at the top of Ranthambore fort situated in the middle Ranthambore National Tiger Reserve the mandir is as old as the fort, the fort was made by Chouhan dynasty (Raja Hameer Dev). you can feel there the religious power."
235,Praise be the lord,A high trek but loved it. we were the last allowed car to go in and the drive inside the jungle towards the temple was wonderful.
236,Temple above tiger reserve,This temple is very famous among most of the Rajasthani hindus. In most of the Rajasthani community all the invitation cards especially wedding cards are first sent to this temple to invite the Lord and after that it is distributed among friends and relatives.During wedding season tonnes of invitation cards are received in this temple.there is definitely some divine power in temple.The best time to visit is between October to february.
237,Lovely morning walk up to temple,"Its a little long Walk from the entrance. The  fun loving and palyful Langoors on the way and at the Entrance to the Temple make your journey enjoyable,"
238,Serves as an adventure as well as holy trip,This whole site is hugely impressive. Spread over a very big area in the middle of rathambore national park. We were lucky enough to be given a guided tour by our hotel proprietor who knew the history very well so it's worth getting a guide. We'll worth a visit.
239,Ranthambore area,"It is a common belief that the first invitation to a wedding is addressed to this deity. It is the only temple in the world where Lord Ganesh is depicted as one with three eyes.The location of this temple is on the top of a fort, hence a number of steps have to be climbed.Another problem is the resident Langoor Monkeys.One should avoid carrying food in hands to avoid the same being snatched by the apes."
240,Inside of Ranthambore fort,"Our first time to this temple of Ganesh ji, Riddhi ji and Siddhi ji. The climb to the temple is beautiful. once we reached the temple, we were scared of the monkeys snatching food. We didn't buy the prasad (laddoos- an offering to gods). We also saw rats crawling over all the food they were selling up there, so just decided to not buy.The darshan (viewing of gods) was smooth and easy. I would love to go there again if I am ever in Ranthambore. In general we found the area clean."
241,Cleanliness!! ,"This is a unique temple of Ganeshji where he has THREE eyes. Usually, only Lord shiva has three eyes. This temple is in Ranthambore fort and visited very frequently by villager. It was a blissful experience. Must visit place for all"
242,Small Temple,Be prepared to walk up to a glorious view of sunset...It is worth it. Plenty peacocks n birds of different names. Be careful of the squirrels though as they are just hopping around. Watch ur step.
243,We went there in winter .. it's an beautiful place to visit,Ganesh temple is at hill and surrounded by ranthambore forest. Only temple of Lord Ganesha with whole family in India.  Many longoors are around the temple.
244,No separate visit required if you are visiting the fort,Must visit1 km walk on stairs and plain ground 25 minute walk from the parking Help and assistance available for elderly people (carriers)Not wheel chair friendly but carriers available at a nominal chargeLots of friendly monkeys on the way
245,Ganesh,This temple was so old and lot of monkey at the temple entrance gate so be careful with monkey and its a part of ranthambhore tiger reserve area so huge jungle we see from the height of Ranthambhore fort.
246,Temple called as Tri Natree Ganesh Ji,"Brilliant location. Filthy temple. No God will likely make such a neglected and dirty place home. Monkeys are everywhere picking crumbs and sifting through the mess pilgrims leave behind. Empty plastic packages are strewn everywhere as is organic waste from discarded food besides dollops of dung, all of which force pilgrims to battle swarms of flies. A temple of great beauty and potential has been decimate by bad management."
247,Must Visit,"this place only for strong leg and strong heart but if you visit it , you think that  it will be unforgettable memory."
248,Heritage Temple- 4th century,"Very auspicious place of ganesh temple having third eye and very auspicious on the hill , having a nice walk and palkis are also available"
249,Ancient Ganesha Temple,Good place to visit especially in wintets and rains . Lots of tourist and this place actually gives jungle type feeling
250,Jai Ganesh,"The first thing that comes to mind about this temple is thr fear.... fear of langoors! There are hundreds of them waiting to pounce on you if they spot you with any food. Your hands are empty and they leave you alone! Having said that, this is the only 3 eyed Ganpati temple i…"
251,A historical and holy place - must visit,"The only temple of Lord Ganesh in the whole world where he resides with his whole family and also he has that third eye on his forehead.Located inside the Fort of Ranthambore, one has to climb almost 50-70 steps to reach the temple, but if you hire a guide, the tales of the bygone era and of the battles,  kings, queens, betrayals, raids and bravery, would keep u enchanted and you would never feel lethargic.But you also get a ""Palki service"", for those who really have a problem but they charge Rs 2000 for this.The temple is a small one and has no great architecture. We offered our prayers and I was glad to finally witness the place whose stories have been told to me since my childhood, one of them being that the first card of Marriage is sent to this temple to invite Ganeshji to bless the wedding.The delight point of this temple were the many langurs playing around. They dnt harm you. But if u have food n flowers, they would try to have a go at them. Dnt b scared. Just buy the Chanas from the local sweet shop and throw it on the ground and feel glad to see how the army of these black faced and long tailed monkeys fight it out for their share.It was fun to play with them!!!"
252,Holy Visit!!!,if you have any auspicious function in your home you can send invitation letter to Lord Ganesha at the address of Trinetra Ganesha Temple in Ranthambore. Every letter is opened and placed in front of the idol of Lord Ganesha. We used to pray Lord Ganesha before starting anything auspicious but this temple is the only place on earth where you can invite Lord Ganesha to attend your auspicious occasion. This is really an amazing and the only temple of Lord Ganesha with having three eyes. If you visit here you will feel an amazing vibe of spirituality inside you. If you are in Ranthambore must visit this temple which is located at the entrance of the Ranthambore Fort inside the National Park.
253,A temple located in a fort,"This place is not for people for who are not physically fit, as it requires quite a climbing,  But it has an excellent view on top and each step is absolutely worth the trouble!"
254,good time pass to go on the top of the hill.,Built by Hindu Rajput rulers of Ranthambore. It has Ganeshji with three eyes which is unique. You have to careful about monkeys.
255,Nice experience,"It's an only temple with entire Ganesh ji family. Ganesh ji , Ridhi and Siddhi, and Labh and Subh... Panditji is also very accommodating... But baware of Monkeys...."
256,Nice old temple in the huge FORT,"Almost 200 Stairs & 2 KM walking. If any one has problem in climbing on Knee trouble, Please not go there."
257,Do visit,Typical apathy of Indian Govt to such Monuments . This received World Heritage Tag and Govt forgot about this place ! Poor signage
258,Only Ganesh Temple were Lord Ganesha is sitting with his whole family,"If you like hiking, climbing, walking, you must go! We spotted more animals enroute to the Ganesh Temple than we saw in the national park. :) Like crocodiles, samba deer, chinkara, peacocks, etc.  The mandir is crowded! Good to visit while at Ranthambore though."
259,Nice temple,What spoils the who fort area is the amount of litter and graffiti everywhere. Quite an easy climb up to the top of the fort. Views are excellent and Ganesh Temple is amazing.
260,Great place to visit ,1. Access is through the Ranthambore fort.2. You need to wear sports foot wear as the fort needs to be explored on foot.
261,Highly Overrated ,"A great park spread over 1334 square KMs, inhabited by hundreds of cheetals, sambhars, peacocks, crocodiles, reptiles and multitudes of birds. And of course 63 tigers. Even if you don't locate the tiger, the drive through in itself is a pleasure. The Ranthambore Fort and the…"
262,A beautiful monument,Trinetra Ganesha Temple is the famous and oldest temple of Lord Ganesha in Rajasthan that comprises of his whole family all together at one place. The temple is about 12 kms from Sawai Madhopur and is well established in Ranthambhore fort.We truly enjoyed being there .Its a beautiful place to visit .
263,Worth a trip,lord ganesh temple with entire his family sitting here. lord ganesha have 3 eyes. its a nice palace in ranthambore fort.
264,renowned temple,Easy enough to get to but not for less than fitLot of monkeys who do not interfere unless you have food in your hands. Better to keep away if you do not like them or are afraid of them.
265,Trinetra Ganesh Temple,"This site seeing is Ranthambhore Fort - cum - Ganesh temple. Ranthambhore Fort & Ganesh temple are one and the same thing. You trek the fort and on top you get to visit the divine temple. Do have a guide along. He will give you useful tips on the fort architecture and the strategy used by the kings. The steps leading to fort are not that steep. We managed to trek with our 3 year old kid. It took an hours time to reach the top. The trek is not tiring. We went in afternoon 3pm, without feeling the heat. Go empty handed & don't carry anything eatables in your hands. Monkeys might snatch any eatables from your hands. Don't worry, the monkeys are not wild. They bother you only when you have any eatables in your hand. Else they will not bother you. Infact they are a sight to your eyes watching them climbing from one trees to another.The Panditji (priest) gave my daughter a garland (Ganesha blessing) and my daughter wore it in her neck. Monkey snatched it when we came out of the temple. It was scary.To all the believers, lord Ganesha loves Dhub (a green grass type leaves). Don't forget to offer this to lord Ganesha. Also you will see a lot of houses built with stones in the temple premises, Locals believe that lord Ganeshas blessing will help you get your own house. You can try your luck. It is also fun to build house with stone.This temple has a lot of religious importance especially with Rajasthanis / Marwaris. All Marwari marriage cards undoubtedly come here to seek Ganesha blessing, which is believed to be very divine & sacred. This is the only temple where Ganesha is seen in three eyes with his entire family - both wife (Riddhi Siddhi) and both kids (Shubh Labh). Believed to be very auspicious temple by Marwaris."
266,Best thing in Ranthambore - Trinetra Ganesh Temple,"We where lucky and saw a tiger , but there's no guarantee our rep went 5 visits without seeing one ,  take a pair of decent binoculars or a camera with at least a x20 zoom as they may be well hidden and some way a way , you iPhone may take a good picture but all you'll see is the landscape , plenty of birds , monkeys and cat food(deer) around , good luck"
267,Good trek,the lord ganesh is worshipped here with his bahan lots of mouse . monkey are creating nuisance other wise excellent
268,A Temple in Core area of Tiger Reserve,take off your shoes and join the devoted.  WE loved this temple and got blessed when we went there. You can buy inexpensive ganesh's for gifts too.
269,Great,Its on huge height and make you tired and after that you could not go anywhere else.But good place to watch and do puja of Lord Ganesh-Without Trunk . Its a Fort of Hamir Dev
270,40 minute trek to the temple but worth it,"Must visit this place for point of view of religion, architecture & archeology. Lots of devotees send first marriage invitation card to the Ganesh ji prior to inviting any one."
271,Ganesh temple,"Not sure if w should blame the guide who accompanied us. But, there was no concrete information about the fort. Rane padmavati and Khilji figured in the history of this fort too. Thousands of monkey around the place, so don't carry eatables"
272,Beautiful and must visit religious place,"If you are visiting Ranthambore during Oct to Feb months then, suggestion is to finish the Safari in the morning & start your walk from the car parking around 3.30pm to 4.00pm. You are going to enjoy awesome sunset views & have some nice clicks. Carry water bottles for a walk if you are with family because you will only get something near the temple at the top. There are lot of other attractions too like the Rani Mahal, Jain Mandir, Kali Mata mandir along the way. Do explore all & if you like you can get a guide. Must try the stone homes as you will see lot of them & you will get interested but you cant break to build yours. You have to find the stones & place.Beware of Monkeys near the Ganesh temple specifically if you are carrying food items & prasad while return. Make sure its there in the bag or give it to the guide as they can help & are used too."
273,Climb up through ancient fort for Darshan,Nice place to visit... a few steep stairs to climb although... and the surroundings were a bit dirty... but the religious fervour and sentiments of visiting the deity of lord Ganesh trinetra overpowers everything else... all in all a must see...👍
274,Peaceful temple in a nice fort,Really enjoyed this fort. Much different than we thought. A young couple walked up the steps by us with a yoke with brass pots on with milk. Get the top of the steps by the temple and there are cows - all bizarre! Beautiful views over the national park. Don't be put off by the height or the steps they are not steep and there are lots of places to stop to look at things and the views. We went early which was pleasant. Our jeep driver was kind and stopped to show us lots of things on our journey to and fro to the fort.
275,Famous Ganesh Mandir ,Ranthambore is famous for its Ganesh temple. Temple has entire lord Ganesh family. There are lots of monkeys.
276,Bizarre temple!,"This place is within the fort, but not a part of the original structure. It is a plain building with no descriptive beauty. The structure is surrounded by stalls owned by flower vendors, Prasad sellers, Puja samagrihi sellers etc. Moreover this place is infested by monkeys -…"
277,very old fort base temple in india,"Though the local people made me uncomfortable because I am heavy yet it was worth watching ,the mesmerising idol of Lord Ganesha made my day."
278,Interesting...,"it took more than an hour for a round trip walk up from the parking area through the fort to the temple. In the end, it wass certainly worthwhile,  as i personally felt a spiritual positive energy after visiting the temple, which reportedly is the most famous Ganesha temple in the entire state of Rajasthan. Fort ruins and wildlife sightings are a bonus when visiting this temple. Definitely a must do in Ranthambore."
279,Very Beautiful Place!,We went by early morning 6.30am . And climb the fort . It was a good walk and Mr. Manoj took care of us. Fort is really big and a trip has to be arranged if one is there in the city. A great history and it’s importance of fort is also mentioned.
280,Nice ..watch out for langur,"If you love history and architecture, please do not miss a visit to Ranthambore Fort. It is completely overshadowed by the Tiger Reserve though it deserves much better.  There are several pols (gates) you pass on your climb into the fort.  The design and beauty of the fort and…"
281,Typical Temple,the temple inside is toòoo far... kids cant walk so much so beware they will definitely get frustrated as there is nothing to eat .. and if you carry something with you .. dont dare to take it out... all the langoors will attack you anytime.do carry water with you but keeping in mind there is no place to go to washroom :) near the temple ...its really difficult to go inside.. and dont get the prasad out .. eat it inside and walk out with empty hands. ..otherwise the langoor will come and take it from you.
282,Busy due to Diwali but still great to see,It is a historical temple . The property is now a world heritage site on the Arravalis . It is like a short trek up and down . For those who are unable to climb up can go up in a palki . The place is inhabitated with cute civilised monkeys who are waiting to snatch flowers and…
283,Nice place with 64 steps,Ganesha temple is the ancient temple in Hamir fort. Lord Ganesha with Riddhi and Siddhi are worshiped there.one can view the whole beauty of forest from this temple.
284,Devine place to visit,"Situated inside Ranthambore Fort, Trinetra Ganesh Temple is yet another attraction in Ranthambore National Park. Trinetra (Three-Eyed) Ganesh or Pratham Ganesh Temple is amongst the oldest temples in Rajasthan. It is one of those temples,"
285,Gorgeousness,Trinetra Ganeshji is one of its kind having third eye to bless you with wisdom. Ganeshji is there with entire family. Guide Naresh made it interesting. Good tracking experience as well. Must visit place
286,Worth going,"Great morning out, I say morning because we visited at 9;am before the rush started, great views, bring food for the monkeys they are very friendly"
287,Temple in a Fort,Like to go somewhere after safari its very devotional place we have to go in friends like very much that is very near of jungle about  some stairs have to feel some tired but very Respectful Ganesh temple  we have  find some bless by Ganesha jai Ganesh
288,Very very quaint and a must do for the cultural experience,A lot of nature and spiritual atmosphere. I pass a day the and I managed to deconnect myself from the regularly life and start my adventure in India
289,Temple & Fort Ruins definitely worth a visit,"Ranthambore is second home for me, as wildlife enthusiast I keep on visiting Ranthambore National Park very oftenly.The first thing for me to do in Ranthambore is to visit the Ganesh temple to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesh for a good wildlife expedition.The temple is located at the far end of the famous Ranthambore Fort and it's a uphill walk that will take 30-45 minutes.Once you the top you can visit the temple, see the famous Ranthambore National Park from the top and visit the ruins of a great fort."
290,The tiger temple,"If you are a follower of Lord Ganesh and send all the wedding and birth invitations to Ranthambore, this needs to be visited. You need to walk a steep step and also negotiate with the monkey's in the vicinity but is an experience."
291,Nice place,Extremely commercial; nothing spiritual about the place. It's a newly made structure with no aesthetic value or beauty
292,Very good place ,"First of all a great thank to those artisans and labourers of that ancient time who did this uphilly architect without having modern tools and technology.hAmazing sight seeing, number of small forts/Hawankunds, ponds and all above Lord Ganesha with his Savari, the cute mouse.Everything is so mesmerizing in the lap of Lord and nature that can't be described how beautiful it is!One thing the visitors should have to care about is that a number of stairs (more than 100) have to be crossed, which is tough for old age devotees.A flock of beautiful peacocks can't stop you from clicking a snapshot.Hold your hand bags tight, otherwise monkeys would take it away.Jai Lord Ganesha..."
293,Interesting,must go place. one should plan properly accordingly time.u should carry ur water while going there.
294,Little far but worth,"Don't carry any eatable item in your hand as there are lot of Langurs, ready to snatch it from your hands. Beware of the fake BABA (standing near stairs - outside the temple), ready to make you fool with their superstitious beliefs.."
295,Spell bound! ,this temple is sure to be seen while you're in ranthambore. But please keep in mind that this resides inside a fort and that means a lot of walking up and down the big and wide concrete steps.
296,Must visit,Temple was nice ...inside the fort. And the monkey over thr were so nice...so nicely they eat from your hand and doesn't trouble you.
297,"Dissapointing , Not scenic and vry tiering",First of all you gona get stuck in traffic jam. Den realy boring long walk. At last one simple temple. Not old architecture. Dissapointing
298,Ganesh temple,"We initally decided to do this on our own , but eventually took a guide with us to understand a bit of history . We reached this place in the afternoon."
299,A must see!! ,"it was my second time. Best, as due to the heat we went very early in the morning thus got there before opening and few minutes before starting the function."
