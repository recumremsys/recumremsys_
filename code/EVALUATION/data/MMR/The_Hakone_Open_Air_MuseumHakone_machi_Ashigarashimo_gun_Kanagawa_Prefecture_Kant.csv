0,"Good, even for a rainy day","We started our day in the drizzle and explored the large sculpture collection. The grounds are beautiful and the sculptures are nicely spaced and arranged. The pond has a small network of little paths coming off it which take you to various hidden gems. Bring 10 or 100¥ coins to feed the enormous koi! There are bathrooms in several different places through the grounds (by the two children's attractions and the gift shops) and the paths are wide enough to accommodate the traffic. My kids did ok with the scavenger hunt in the Picasso hall (otherwise would have suffered greatly) but they loved playing in the tree of nets but start there, it's gets crowded by 10-11 o'clock. We enjoyed the foot onsen, a nice break from the sculptures and art exhibits. Do this after the stairs up the tower--dont skip the tower, it may look unimpressive outside but it's amazing inside!The water was very comfortable and the seating easily accomodates social distancing (but not wheelchair accessible). We got a beer and some baked gods from the restaurant and it's expensive compared to the states and I've had better food from other food counters at attraction in Japan but the lemongrass beer was good and the muffin vanished even though it was a big dry. Not all spaces are stroller or wheelchair friendly (the tower, the pond, and the star garden) but the indoor exhibits all have access for mobility challenged.We stayed for about 2.5 hours and got lunch at Lawson's and ate in the parking lot (the other restaurants were closed for off season or packed)"
1,So refreshingly fun!,"We visited on a sunny day and spent around 3 hours at the park. The sculptures are modern and vary in style, including Moore, Miro and Picasso. It is quite breathtaking seeing the modern art surrounded by autumn leaves on the mountains. There is also lots of spots for kids to enjoy, a foot spa and a place to feed fish. The cafe has a nice selection of food, drinks and ice cream."
2,Art from the Far Side - a planet far far away,"What a gorgeous setting for many sculptures.We spent 2 hours walking the grounds, appreciating the topography, views, and thoughtfully located sculptures throughout the site. There was a surprise/ reveal around every corner and along the paths.The restaurant was mediocre but had a great view."
3,Don't miss this,We spent two hours here with friends. It is spectacular. We were very lucky with the weather. The sculptures are arranged very thoughtfully in the gardens. The Henry Moore collection must be one of the best anywhere and certainly the most elegantly set into the landscape.
4,World class,We loved walking around looking at all of the outdoor sculptures. I really enjoyed the Symphonic Sculpture. It is beautiful and I’m sorry I missed seeing it illuminated from the inside at night. Near the end you will see a silver sphere suspended above the walkway. It effects the surroundings.
5,Really enjoyed roaming around outside admiring the art.,We really enjoyed our visit to this open air museum the gardens are beautiful and they have wonderful Sculptures on show We enjoyed the Henri Moore sculptures and also the Picasso displayThis is a nice way to spend a few hours while in the area
6,Must check out when in Hakone,This was our first stop in Hakone and very enjoyable with interesting sculptures walking around the open air field and discovering rather fun interpretations.The symphonic tower is a beautiful kaleidoscope of coloured glass and Picasso museum is not to be missed.
7,"Outsized contemporary sculpture dotting the jills beside meandering paths, nice tea house, too","This museum was a surprise to us. Beautiful, the magnificent gardens are incredible. All the masterpieces where perfectly curated! Its a must on a trip to Hakone-Machi"
8,"Our first stop, checked",This museum was fantastic. Such a lovely set up with great walking tracks and pathways. Even the fish were a joy to feed. Loved the sculpture for children too.
9,"Even if you're not into museums, this one is a must","Great place to visit. A lot of different art on show, we really enjoyed our afternoon roaming around the grounds."
10,Wish we had planned ahead,Beautiful landscape and exhibition of modern art. Everything is perfectly kept and it's amazing walking in the park and enjoying art at the same time. The Picasso and Manzú expo are very interesting and add a very good reason to go.
11,Finish with a hot springs foot bath!,"Walking by we spot the museum and we were compelled to go inside.   Plenty of large art figures scattered throughout the property.  Highlight is the Picasso works within the museum complex.   Take your time, as the collection covers a long period of his life and is well organized.  Hot day requires lots of water and hat."
12,"Aboslutely fantastic, even in the rain!","We lucked out and had a beautiful day to enjoy the museum, which definitely added to our experience.  It is very well done with the outdoor sculptures, the lawns, the trees, etc. all set against the beautiful green mountain scenery.  We had a nice leisurely stroll, taking in the outdoor artwork, which is nicely spread out.  The Picasso exhibit was very good.  The foot bath was a nice relaxing rest part way through our visit."
13,Unexpectedly rich in sculpture and art,The exhibits are very special and interesting. We spent long time moving around and enjoying exhibition.
14,Great place,"Worth the time to visit this place, it's interesting to find the sculpture and museum with impressive colours and shapes."
15,", SPECIAL AND UNEXPECTED","What an amazing setting to enjoy art. There is a huge variety of sculptures set on beautiful grounds overlooking Hakone. The art is unique and visually interesting so there is something that everyone will enjoy, even if you aren't an art lover. Also a great picasso collection. One of the best places we went to in Hakone and just a short ride from Gora station on the bus or short walk."
16,Fantastic,"We absolutely loved this Museum. The collection is amazing, many great works of art. I particularly liked the tower with the stained glass. We put our feet into the hot spring water too."
17,Art Overload ,"We thoroughly enjoyed this visit exploring works by great European and Japanese artists under the sunshine.  The Symphonic Sculpture was so cool to climb up through the prisms of color.  Children's netted play space actually lured more than a few adults, too."
18,Unique displays,"We had a really lovely afternoon at this unique outdoors museum. The setting is wonderful, really special to be able to regard these works of art against the Hakone mountain backdrop. Although we have no kids with us we were really impressed at how kid friendly this museum is. But it's the 2000 individual works of art which are the real appeal, a really nice Picasso exhibition and numerous other objects by artists around the world that both challenge and reward you.Highly recommended"
19,A gem in Hakone,This is a beautiful mostly outdoor museum. The exhibits and artwork are fascinating. It is a great place to bring your kids. Much of the art is hands on. There’s also a unique playground inside a building that resembles Jenga blocks. There’s a warm and relaxing foot bath. The Picasso exhibit is indoors and comprehensive. This museum is like a combination park and museum. I really enjoyed the day.
20,Best Art Museum Ever,This is not a typical museum but quite amazing out door art gallery where the sculptures are beautifully set out in a garden landscape which on a clear day was a great experience to wander around and admire.and if tou really like art work this is a place you should not miss
21,What a great expereince,"Our visit to the sculpture park was excellent. Henry Moore pieces and others set amongst a beautifully kept Japanese garden. We are sculpture fsns and spolit to have Yorkshire Sculpture Park in our doorstep, so our expectations were high, but this place delivered. Great interactive sculptures for children too. Well worth the visit. Lovely to soak tired feet in foot onsen in the park."
22,Great open air museum,"We were so impressed by the quality of the sculptures at the open air museum. It’s set in a beautiful surrounding of mountains and it rivals almost all sculpture gardens we’ve ever been to. If inHakone this is a must see. P,an a few hours to enjoy the gardens. Also they have a few interactive sculptures for young children"
23,Amazingly beautiful setting to view art,"We spent an unexpectedly delightful afternoon, quietly exploring the open air exhibits. Don't forget to view the Picasso museum, you won't be disappointed and the Museum also has a lovely shop as you leave the facility."
24,super museum,We were surprised at how interesting the Hakone Open-Air Museum was.  Very interesting and different art works.
25,Must see,What a fantastic place to visit. Very unexpected. Wonderful sculptures throughout the outdoor gardens and  then you get to gallery. Thoroughly recommend
26,Hakone is amazing!,"The sculpture exhibitions are wonderful, set in a beautiful location and easy to walk around. A good variety of work here, I was not impressed by the Picasso exhibit but that is because I think he is overrated."
27,Must visit ,"This is a nicely landscapes park with a good selection of modern and contemporary sculptures. There are lots of pieces from Henry Moore scattered throughout the rolling landscape. During the spring, the cherry blossoms are a beautiful backdrop. The museum is a quick walk from the train stop."
28,You must visit,Take the time to wonder around and experience this wonderful art destination. It is a beautiful trip up to the location in the mountains and worth the visit for the trip alone. The gallery itself is stunning.
29,Amazing,"Our first visit and we thought it was very well done. They have a number of exhibits that kids enjoy, making it a nice place for the family to enjoy together. Disappointed that the Picasso exhibit is closed until July but we’ll just have to go again"
30,A really interesting open air museum.,This is a spectacular sculpture museum in a beautiful setting. Its probably the most impressive place we visited in the area.
31,Beautiful ,Wow! What an awesome experience. We absolutely loved our visit. Lots of interesting sculptures on display amongst really beautiful gardens. Really worth the visit.
32,Amazing and beautiful,"Loved this place, beautiful artworks in a stunning location. Easy to reach from the train, we had a lovely relaxing afternoon wandering around."
33,Amazing Sculpture Garden and Picasso Exhibit,"This was a wonderful open air sculpture museum with a decent indoor Picasso collection.  The backdrop of Hakone is beautiful and as a pleasant surprise - there are several features of this museum that are quite engaging for children (we traveled with our 9 year old twins).  There is a tower that consists of a spiral staircase with ever-changing mosaics within the tower, and two sculptures that are actually designed for children to use as play structures.  The entire family had a wonderful time and well worth taking the time to visit while in Hakone."
34,Great museum!,"We recently visited with our 9 and 11 year old children. So much of the museum is interactive. The grounds are just beautiful. This visit was enjoyed by our kids just as much as DisneySea and probably a lot more enjoyable for us parents. We spent about 2-3 hours there. Not a lot of great food options. The restaurant area had s buffet and an alacarte, neither looked that appealing. We caught s taxi there from Hakone- Yumoto area (about 40 aud approx) and caught a bus back (train still not in operation after typhoon damage). They ran every 30 mins. The bus stop was right out front."
35,Amazing Museum,"This open museum is a beautiful museum, featuring a number of sculptures with stunning views of the valley and the surrounding mountains. Among the sculptures you will find in the museum's garden are sculptures by Yigal Tumarkin, the Israeli sculptor. The museum also has several interior spaces, including the Picasso Hall, which consists of two floors of works of art and sculptures, created by Picasso himself. Reasonable entrance fee. Opening hours: Daily from 9:00 to 17:00. How long should I visit? Between one and two and a half hours."
36,Enjoyable couple of hours,"This is a beautiful sculpture garden, with many noteworthy 20th Century European and Asian sculptures, beautifully set around the grounds.  It also is home to a Picasso Museum, with a number of examples of the different styles of his art.  Particularly noteworthy and unique are his Bullfighting series and stained glass works, which you don't usually see in other venues.  Definitely a highlight of our Hakone visit."
37,"Very nice sculpture park and museum, if the weather is nice.",The whole family loved this museum. Such a significant collection of amazing sculptures and the Picasso pavilion is also fab. Loved this place and possibly missed seeing Fuji because we stayed so long. Haven’t seen so many Henry Moore’s in one place and lots of other highly notable artists.
38,Enjoyable walk,"We happened to visit this museum while exploring Hakone on foot.  It’s a beautiful park setting for an amazing collection of sculptural art by Caulder, Henry Moore, Picasso, etc.  On the same grounds is a building devoted to artworks by Picasso, including ceramics rarely seen.  We did not have time to see the other indoor gallery.  The museum is an all-day event and highly recommended for students and lovers of art."
39,This is a beautiful art park,"This was part of a trip to Hakone, the gardens are beautiful and we saw them at there best on a sunny day. As the title says it is an Open-air museum so most exibits are outside. The picasso exibit is indoors but the venue is so much more than pissaco. well worth a visit"
40,Amazing Park and Museum,this is a must see attraction-a wonderful collection of fantastic sculptures set in a beautiful landscaped parkreal variety of pieces - a lot of henry moores- and a big gallery of Picassomake sure to also see the 20th century gallery above the cafe and also the interactive lab before the exitjust wonderful and very different
41,Visit on trip to Hakone,We were really impressed with the indoor Picasso Museum.  Two floors of beautifully displayed Picasso art of all media.  The outdoor statuary was also well displayed.  A nice way to spend an afternoon.
42,A relaxing way to spend a couple of hours!,Wonderful morning in this beautiful open air museum - pieces displayed so well with nature displaying sculpture works so well.
43,In a word - outstanding!,Beautiful outside art museum. Sculptures were truly beautiful. Large outside grounds exceptionally well maintained. It’s a real experience walking around seeing all the different
44,Hakone Open Air Museum - Gora,"It was quite a long drive but definitely worth it.  The exhibits were situated in the most picturesque of surroundings allowing visitors to walk freely amongst them, we actually ran out of time as it was such an interesting place.  There was a brilliant play area for children plus a lovely coffee shop which also sold souvenirs but there was also a main shop selling a wide range of  beautiful souvenirs.  It is somewhere I would visit again."
45,Amazing even in the rain,"This was definitely the highlight of my Hakone Loop. The sculptures are fantastic something for every taste. The kids are catered for with two unique play areas. There is also a free footbath which is a nice stop as you wander through the park. Of course, the Picasso exhibition is a highlight as are the other indoor exhibitions. There are a variety of cafes and restaurants on site as well as several large gift shops. A highly recommended stop on the Hakone trail."
46,Outdoor Sculpture Park,Fairly easy walking park to view the different sculptures.The amazing greenery and tranquil ambience add to the joy of visit. Climb the circular tower near the cafe (< 100 narrow steps) which offesr different views of the park and displays. Treat your feet to warm foot spa (Towel could be purchased to dry off) And a cuppa to round off the venture.
47,Very interesting museum. Like none I have seen before,Nice walk on a cloudy day. The Picasso collection in the Black building wears very interesting!Many of the Art sculptures were interesting and pleasant to see and appreciate.The grounds were well designed and laid out.A most enjoyable walk at th Hakone Open Air Museum!
48,Perfect Day Out  with Kids,Not surprised it is #1 in hakone. There are lots of cool open air sculptures to check out. Prob takes around 90 mins to see
49,Outstanding outside art museum,This was included in our tour and we were so thankful it was.  The Picasso Exhibition within the complex is fabulous and follows his work through the years with an incredible display within the building where it is housed.  The park has some great works of art and anyone visiting should allow at least 2 hours to take it all in.  We also had lunch in the Restaurant upstairs.  We avoided the buffet and went for the a-la-carte which we found very good and at a reasonable price.
50,The best outdoor museum ever!,The sun was shining. The sky was blue. The art was inspiring and so beautifully set in the magnificent gardens and we just strolled through and soaked up the beauty. This is a must see.
51,Unique Mountain Experience,"This museum is gorgeous and huge ! There is many sculptures, sculptures which you can climb in (only for children) and beautiful parks. The Picasso museum is also fantastic and recommended to go. My family and I went on a hot day which was very annoying but still fun."
52,Definitely worth a visit,"A breath of fresh air! Beautifully exposed art, surrounded by trees and flowers. You can enjoy Picasso paintings and it’s excellent for families, as it has some art creations for children up to 12 to play. Plan at least 3 hours for this museum as you can have a nice pause at the museum café and also soak your feet in the museum feet onsen."
53,Great museum,"Beautiful grounds. Several different buildings in addition to the vast outdoor sculpture garden. Picasso exhibit is worth a visit just in its own. Take advantage of the free foot bath. Only negative is that the snacks are quite pricey, not surprising for a museum but just be aware."
54,Extensive modern sculpture collection - but be ready for lots of walking!,"You need to visit this unique museum to experience the joy of walking through the beautiful grounds, the appreciation of artistic displays and the laughter of children interspersed in every corner. This place was indescribably beautiful during my visit because autumn leaves dotted the space with hues of yellow, red, orange and brown. Definitely worth a leisurely visit!"
55,a great experience,"We have been to sculpture parks before but this one is truly wonderful. Quite apart from the quality of the exhibits, the park and its layout is quite outstanding. We thought we would only be there for an hour or so but in the end stayed till closing time and could have spent the entire day here."
56,More than worth a visit,"What an amazing place! This is truly a world class attraction with art presented in a beautiful garden setting. Sculptures from local and international artists.It is on the small railway on the way up the mountain, and was a real surprise. Go out of your way to see this is my suggestion. Words can not describe."
57,"Extensive Picasso collection, bathe your feet in natural hot spring water too!","A very interesting collection of sculptures by international artists, in a nice park. It was well worth the couple of hours we spent there. There is also a small collection of Picasso's works, but the pavilion was closed, so we only got to see a part of the collection."
58,Selection out of this world,"We loved this museum. They had wonderful sculptures, a well tended garden, interactive art for the kids, and even a free warm foot bath."
59,Open air museum,Enjoyed the art itself and especially the outdoor setting.  We are not art snobs but experienced a relaxing and fun time walking throughout when the cable car was closed and some slight rain.  It was not too crowded as were here after school started.
60,Excellent museum/gallery in tranquil surroundings,A beautiful way to spend a few hours amongst the lovely surroundings and amazing sculptures.  Of course best viewed in good weather but don’t let a few showers stop you missing out on such a beautiful experience.  Wonderful gift shop and restaurant here as well. Picasso exhibition very interesting although not too many paintings but interesting pottery and other objects of art. Gardens and forest so well cared for and maintained.It was an unforgettable experience for us.
61,Surprise to visit Picasso ,"Spent a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours wondering around the grounds taking in all of the delightful exhibits.  There is something for everyone, including some 300 Picasso pieces in a dedicated building. Even on a rainy day we just grabbed an umbrella and went for it.....enjoy!"
62,"Brilliant, a must see in Hakone","Great pathway. Easy walk. Amazing sculptures and presentation. Wonderful photo ops. A large cafe in the center with a foot bath just outside the door. It was hot and humid outside—so a warm foot bath was not so alluring. Closes at 5pm, which was ok - but as we made our way out, guided to the gift shop, they shoooed us out! Come on! If the outside museum closes at 5:00, then the gift shop needs to stay open till 6pm. We didn’t buy a thing because of that!"
63,Sculptures that make you stand and stare,Excellent placement of amazing pieces kept us all interested despite the temperature and humidity.  The variety of the pieces gave us all chance to see a favourite. Would definitely recommend.
64,Exceptional experience ,"I really liked the concept of art pieces set amongst manicured gardens, it makes for a great day out and gets the kids excited as well. The Picasso exhibit was fascinating and I personally loved the majesty of the symphonic sculpture which puts a strained glass tube you can attend via a spiral staircase."
65,Good times/naughty kids,This is a wonderful museum with a wide range of works well placed in the landscape -- and a foot bath in the hot springs half way round!
66,A amazing interesting unique experience. A must see.,A cooling day to get inspired by the nature and art and was inspired to take lots of pictures and highly recommend to visit open museum if you at Hakone. Bring kids to get educated through play!
67,Beautiful,"Did not really know what to expect but it was fantastic. The open air aspect wonderful, lots of Henry Moore sculptures and many other wonderful sculptures too. Definitely worth a visit."
68,"One of the most unique and wonderful outdoor museums, highly recommended!",Loved this museum. Had a great time wondering through the park-like exhibit. The Picasso section is being renovated but they have it in a temporary location so don’t fret.  Walking distance from the station. Don’t forget to use your Hakone pass to get a small discount.
69,Absolutely brilliant,Breathtaking large scale art in the most beautiful setting. Loved being able to sit in the footbath onsen half way round . Even though the museum was buzy with visitors- it was still spacious enough to feel you had time and room to enjoy the fabulous works of art . I can’t recommend enough for all ages and all art tastes .
70,a nice outing for a nice day,"Wonderful gardens to walk around, see sculptures as the artist intended. Picasso exhibit was added bonus, aAndy Gorman bonus. Great shop and overall spend time here to take it all in"
71,Breath taking museum ,Lots of sculptures in the open air but arranged throughout very attractive gardens and parkland.  Large Picasso indoor gallery which was under renovation when we visited but some exhibits in another building.  Discount available on entrance fee with Hakone pass.
72,Incredible installations against an incredible backdrop!,"I´m not very interested in sculptures and art but this museum was great, with a lot of sculptures in the park and also a building dedicated to Picasso art only."
73,Nice art,Well worth the trip. We spent a few hours there on a beautiful day. Not crowded. Plenty of well placed sculptures.
74,Our favorite museum in Japan!,"This museum is better than I imagined. It’s very open, has a lot of greenery, and perfect for kids to explore. The majority of the sculptures are scattered around a walking path, so it’s nice to walk around and enjoy the art along the way."
75,A sizeable collection of artwork in a beautiful park.,We arrived at this  park to be amazed to see works by Henry Moore and Rodin side by side along with works by numerous other Artists well worth an afternoon
76,Definitely worth the visit,"As a matter of fact it is both a lovely  park and an interesting museum. So nicely designed, great landscape architecture. Many very striking sculptures."
77,Fabulous exhibition,This is a gem. Without any expectations I was surprised about the museum. Very nice and at the time of our visit (Friday at 3pm) not crowded at all. Some very fine sculptures - also not your typical dull ones. go and see!
78,Tranquil & Creative space ,"Set in beautifully landscaped surroundings, this is a wonderful environment in which to view large modern art sculptures.  If you happen to have beautiful spring weather, then all the better for your experience.  Dress appropriately and be prepared to cover some ground, so good walking shoes are called for.  If your feet get a bit tired, you'll enjoy the foot spa that is on the property.  You'll find many artists represented, including some very well known.  This is a delightful experience if you enjoy modern sculptures."
79,Amazing even on a rainy day ,"We were here on a rainy day and still loved walking around the gardens!  This has to be one of the best sculpture gardens that I have visited with so much to see, as well as an indoor Picasso museum and a stained glass silo to climb.  We had a wonderful day so don't. be turned off by the weather.  Enjoy it if you can!"
80,Expansive park with delightful sculphures,"If you’re an art lover this place is magnificent. The sculptures were great. Unfortunately, the Picasso was closed."
81,We had great weather for it,"The weather was foggy,overcast and light rain so we hesitated to go to an open air museum but I am so glad we went! This is an astounding museum, beautifully designed and so much to enjoy. If you're an art lover you could spend days here. Many of the installations are experiences. The whole museum is extraordinary. Don't forget to leave time for the digital interaction exhibit at the exit."
82,World Class,Museum has a lot of nice sculptures. We also used the foot bath which was nice after all the walking that we did.
83,Fabulous ,Loved this place !!! Everything is so delicately exhibited throughout the beautiful garden. The have some impressive pieces from important world artist. Greaaaaat place to take pics ! Totally worth it !
84,Fun and nice museum,"This is an essential stop if you are going to be in the area.  The sculptures are unique, the outdoor foot bath is fun, and the views are lovely."
85,A real highlight in Hakone,Nice garden to walk around into with lots of statues from known artists. Picasso building was closed for renovation but selection of works was mobed into the main building so we could still enjoy them.
86,Was hot and they had really good air con,This place was amazing with a ton to do. I think we got lucky because there was a festival and firework show after our boat trip.
87,world class,"We arrived to this museum mid afternoon, but on hindsight wished that we could spend more time here! The grounds are quite large with artwork spaced out strategically across the grounds. The girls discovered the Woods of Net pavilion by Tezuka Architects, with the net artist Toshiko Horiuchi Macadam knitted the net entirely by hand, which is designed for children under twelve to crawl in, roll around, and jump on the net. The structure is entirely composed of timbers without any metal parts. 320 cubic meter of timber members are used and there is nothing same among all 589 members."
88,A Must-See In Hakone!!!,fantastic location to visit for all ages. there is a hugh indoor playground for kids that is made up of nets. kids can run around the entire open air museum
89,Beyond phenomenal,"We went into town to see the Hakone Museum of Art because of our interest in ceramics.  We had some time after lunch and decided to walk over to the Open Air Museum (without having really researched it).  We were blown away.  Beautiful setting, well curated pieces.  The two hours we had left were not enough to really appreciate everything.  And this was on a cold, drizzling day.  Can't imagine how nice it must be when the sun is out."
90,"Windy, cold, no grass but still pretty awesome!",It is worth going to Hakone just to spend the day in this amazing sculpture garden.  Plus the Picasso museum was well worth spending a few hours.  It was well designed and very easy to enjoy with wonderful art.
91,Outdoor art,"The scuptures, galleries and gardens are fantastic. This is an art gallery with a difference. We loved it."
92,Amazing museum ,"This is an amazing museum on top of the mountain, inside the huge volcanic crater. Most beautiful place to visit from a brief trip from Tokyo. For art and nature lover, this a trip of a lifetime. You need at least 2 days to be able to go around this beautiful place.  Recommended"
93,#1 Hakone destination,It is a beautiful museum with a large collection of statues. Modern artists from all over the world. Beautiful indoor collection of Picasso. Mainly ceramics but also some paintings. Climb up the tower for a beautiful view. They have a foot bath so don’t forget a small towel. Not to miss
94,Fun and beautiful open air exploration ,It was truly amazing It was my first open air museum and won’t be the last The sculptures are incredible and go perfectly with the impecable gardens Also you have plenty Picasso art which gives a good contrast with the outside exposures
95,Stunning,"The sun was out  after a few days of Typhoon rain and my kids and I loved the outdoor experience.  There was something for everyone, quiets spaces and the amazing Horiuchi MacAdam knitted playground which my 7 year old lost his mind over!  We spent a whole day there and the bullet trained back to Tokyo, having left our luggage in the  great locker space at the front of the museum after overnighting in Hakone. The public transport here is very easy to access, however, do leave enough time to wait for trains in busy times as once they are full and you may have to wait for the next train. The Hakone Free pass make this seemless, and easy to get around."
96,Highlight of our visit to Hakonr,Spent a few hours here wandering around. The sculptures are all well spread out and each has a little explanation plaque near to it. A good mix of European and Japanese works. We had a 200yen discount with the Hakone free passThe Picasso building is very big and has a lot of sketches and even pottery items made by the artist. You can relax in the hot spring footbath. Really relaxing for the feet The attendant there even took a photo of us and you can purchase a foot towel from the box by the side of the long foot bath. If you have children there is a great play area for them inside a wooden building
97,Nice Sculptures,We spent about 3 and 1/2 hours walking around and taking fun photos of the sculptures.  Stopped for coffee at the cafe near the Picasso exhibit.  Parking discount to ¥500 was very nice too.
98,"One of the, if not the highlight of Hakone day trips","Perhaps the best museum in Hakone - stroll around the gardens and look at fabulous sculptures by Henry Moore, Brancusi, Leger, Barbara Hepworth, Japanese artist Yoshitatsu Yanagihara and many many others. My favourite was Carl Mille's ""Man and Pegasus"" statue on a huge column. Take a leisurely stroll around on a fine day and immerse yourself in art and nature. There is an indoor collection of Picasso ceramics, although they aren't so interesting."
99,Memorable and essential,"I love museums, art, nature, and this place had everything I wanted. Picasso exhibit is a must! Dip your feet in the hot spring water after you are done walking around, it's worth it!"
100,Very nice and worth the price,"We just loved our time at the The Hakone Open-Air Museum something that I certainly wasn't expecting, the exhibits are weird but interesting and the gardens just beautiful. The sculptures exquisite some you may understand others not so, but again so interesting. There is a small cafe to stop by for drinks or a snack/lunch.I'm so glad we visited this outdoor museum not that I'm into art but as I said, so interesting and unique. I"
101,Not to be missed!,"An unique museum, just by its name and concept of having exhibits out in open air. A path has been laid out for visitors, so it was an easy experience. A family-friendly place where strollers can be loaned. Visit the Symphonic Sculpture - it looks normal and dark from the outside but turns out colourful from the inside."
102,Impressive grounds and sculptures ,it is rare to visit a museum and the kids do not want to get out. They played a lot in the installations and Art-Experiences in the park. Really an amazing place to visit with your kids. even below 12 years old.
103,Trip to Hakone,This mainly sculpture garden and museum is a must visit in Hakone. World class sculptures by people such as Henry Moore were on display and the Picasso section was extensive. The gardens were magnificent and well maintained to display the many sculptures.
104,Wonderful sculpture park in beautiful setting,This is an outstanding sculpture park that will dazzle you. Certainly a 2 hour  visit is recommended. There is a cafe in the centre of the grounds which we did not use but was busy.
105,Must beautiful museum ,"This is probably one of the best museums I have visited. The exhibits are excellent. So much to see and ponder. The cooling foot bathing area is a must and there are towels you can purchase very reasonably. There are a couple of great climbing frames for children - they looked fun, pity adults are not allowed. There is a pond area with lots of Koi carp - you can buy small pots of food.Museum shop is card - a vast array of prints available.Discount with the Hakone card."
106,Incredible gallery in an incredible location.,A highlight from my experience in hakone . I love the design and layout of this museum  and some of the Picasso pieces were amazing.Would like to see the nature part a little more groomed but other then that good memories.
107,Increible,"Highly recommend visiting; as a family, we enjoyed it very much. I think the park is accessible for buggies and wheelchairs. We spent a lovely hour or two here."
108,Must See!,"Blown away by the beauty of enjoying art outdoors. This is an incredible day out, in a gorgeous setting, with obviously stunning art. I cannot recommend this higher."
109,"Wonderful museum, surprisingly high quality , beautiful surroundings",A surprise!  Beautiful setting; out door sculptures and indoor comprehensive Picasso Museum. Not to be missed!
110,Not a typical Museum,"The weather clearly makes a difference and we were fortunate that it was a bright, sunny day, but the museum is in beautiful grounds with some great scupltures."
111,Great to visit even on a wet day,"This is one of the best museum.  As nearly all exhibits are outdoor, try to go on a dry day.  You will enjoy it more.  There are 2 exhibits for kids and they are good fun."
112,Great outdoor museum. ,"Absolutely stunning museum both inside and out!!!  Fantastic outdoor sculptures throughout the grounds and an  impressive Picasso collection.  I could have spent an entire day wondering the grounds and the indoor exhibits.  Very, very special.  My #1 favorite museum in Japan."
113,This place was a great surprise!,Wonderful experience for all ages. Great display of art in a park setting. Chance to experience some picassos. Beautiful time. Expect to walk and interact with the art. Perfect for school age children
114,"A ""must see""  attraction",Very interesting museum. If weather allows it is well worth it.Picasso exhibit was great also. Easy to get to from train station. Our favorite day thing to do in Hakone.
115,Nice day activity,Brilliant outdoor museum. Very interactive and great Picasso exhibition. Nice foot bath too. Really good for kids too.
116,Impressive and quite a surprise,"This place has stunning sculptures set against a backdrop of majestic mountains. Nature and art together. What else does one need? If you’re near Hakone and you can stop here, it’s a must see."
117,Art and nature in perfect harmony,"Great selection of Japanese and international sculpture in a beautiful setting (gardens) set in the mountains. A gem! Loved every moment of my visit. Great facilities, indoor and outdoor. For all ages. And a unique foorbath in which to rest your weary feet. Recommended if you are an art lover!"
118,A Spectacular Sculptural Experience with a Beautiful Mountain Backdrop,Visited the museum when visiting the area with friends. Lovely to be outdoors and enjoying the exhibits.
119,amazing works,"My husband and I were fortunate to visit this lovely museum / park on a gorgeous May afternoon.We’d just arrived from Tokyo for a one-night stay at the Ten-Yu resort, and sent our luggage along to the resort from the Gora train station while we did some sightseeing. The Open Air Museum was our first stop.And the first thing we did was to grab lunch at the Chokoku-No-Mori restaurant overlooking the grounds. We both went with the seafood salad and were very happy with our selection. It was full of mussels, shrimp, octopus, scallops, and crab meat. The dining area was a bit worn and dated but the food, the service, and the view were all wonderful.Then we took a leisurely walk around the sculpture garden and saw some nice work by Henry Moore, Miro, Jean Arp, Antony Gormley, and a lot of other talented artists. We briefly stopped for coffee at the café at the half-way mark in the winding trail, then worked our way back to the entrance / exit. We didn’t get into the Picasso pavilion because it was closed for repairs. They moved most of the work to a building closer to the entrance / exit. It pains me to admit that we skipped that building because our time was tight. Oh well, perhaps next time!Recommended!"
120,Amazing sculpture garden,This place was absolutely amazing .  I just loved it from the moment I entered with the beautiful lawns surrounded by mountains as an extraordinary  backdrop to the most fabulous sculptures from the likes of Rodin and Moore and Japanese sculptors. There is a Picasso gallery if you are into Picasso which I thought was alittle underwhelming. The museum shop was a little gem with some interesting giftlines. There is a bit of walking to take in all the park and some great kid spaces . You  need a minimum of 2 hours to do this place justice and a bit more time would be beneficial.
121,Beautiful art in nature,"Our tour guide took us here and we had no expectations. It was an awesome surprise to be able to see such wonderful pieces of art in the open picturesque landscape. There were multiple very interactive structures such as a star maze, a wooden igloo looking structure that had a little rope jungle gym inside (only for little kiddies) and a glass prizm gym again for the little kiddies to go in and climb. There was a picasso art museum and outside there were a bunch of picasso art inspired statues. There was a symphonic tower that was covered with wonderful stained glass and a stairwell to the top where you can overlook the whole open art museum. Then were was also a hot steam area where you could relax and bathe your feet and legs. It was very serene and peaceful to walk thru and just admire all the pieces and works of art. The very well manicured landscape was accentuated by the beautiful day and weather we had. It was a very good surprise to our tour!"
122,Very Nice but Not Essential,"Great pieces of art, well spread across a beautiful green park, with a great background of mountains and woods. No overkill, so the museum can be done in a fair timing. Some nice surprises, an interactive part at the end, and a big shop. Easy accessible by bus and train."
123,Surprising enjoyable visit ,"This museum is one of the main highlights of my recent trip to Japan. It's hidden in the mountain of Hakone and comprised mainly of sculptures of various prominent artists. The art is scattered around the large museum grounds, and although we travelled in winter, it was still fantastic I think it will look stunning in autumn colours. The works are tastefully placed and blend with the environment. The biggest draw card is Picasso pavilion, with quite sizable collection of his paintings, graphics, small sculptures and what was the most interesting, his pottery, which he took up in his late 60th. The only little piece of criticism, that not allowing photographing in Picasso pavilion is such an old school. None of these works are sensitive to flash, and in the age of Instagram, the more people photograph, the more visitors it will attract."
124,Stunning!,Located in the heart of Hakone is a spectacular open air museum filled with great outdoor sculptures by the best artists in the world. An outstanding collection of works displayed magnificently between trees and great landscape design. A must go place. Just hope for good weather.
125,Japan Holiday 2019,If you enjoy art- then this is a must see! Breath taking beauty countryside with amazing art- what more could you ask for?
126,A Unique Art Museum - Don't Miss,So many works of art including a Picasso Museum. You can see/feel the effort they put into the synergy between the art works and the landscaping. We spent the whole day there from morning till after lunch. I've seen comments people completing this in 3 hours...not possible in my opinion.
127,Well worth a visit,"The museum is located in a beautiful garden, with statues of the best artists in the world. It also has a showroom of several of Picasso's creations.Worth a visit."
128,A must see,"The open air museum has a variety of sculpture by Japanese and European artists in a delightful open-air setting. It was established in the 1970s and a few of the pieces look a bit dated, but overall there is so much good artwork that this wa an excellent afternoon."
129,Love love love!,"Wonderful museum, great architecture, good combination of indoor and outdoor. don't miss the feet bath."
130,"Outstanding and interesting place. Very special exhibits, one can spend long time enjoying the place.","This was a great day out, need to allow at least 2-3 hours to see everything and allow the children to enjoy. The restaurant is very overpriced so plan around meal breaks."
131,Spectacular art in spectacular setting ,"Great sculptures, well laid out. Picasso collection was a lot better than anticipated. Admission price was very reasonable.Well worth a visit."
132,Beautifull museum,"I never expected this!  The Open Air museum has perhaps the best outdoor sculpture garden in the world.  Yes the world.  The variety of art works on display are wonderful, from the traditional freestanding figures by Henri Moore or Rodin to the more modern pieces that defy description but are visually unique and eye-catching.  The setting for all this art is in a well manicured outdoor setting designed to show each art work in its best possible setting.  Some pieces are displayed in water, others on the open lawn and others in alcoves or on the hill.  This sculpture garden looks like a Disney theme park.In addition to the sculpture there are several installations designed for young kids to play on.  There is also a 300 piece Picasso collection of ceramics that has its own pavilion among the outdoor installations.  There is an extensive support infrastructure what includes a restaurant a cafe a large museum shop, etc.  If you have never been a fan of outdoor art installations, try coming here, this museum (theme park?) may just change your mind."
133,Best Sculpture Garden,"This was a beautiful outdoor museum/park. Cost about $16 usd for an adult. Has play areas of sculptured art and sculpture live action interaction (on screen) for young children. Large Picasso museum, stained glass tower, suspension bridges in a forest area, modern globe balls, and a foot bath!"
134,Took my Breath Away,"My family of 2 adults and 2 kids (6 and 9 years) enjoyed our visit to the Open Air Museum. The two kid friendly exhibits are wonderful for the kids to run and burn off energy. They also enjoyed feeding the carp. And we definitely all enjoyed the free hot springs foot bath!  (Tip: take a small hand towel to dry your feet afterwards or buy one for 100 yen).The area is scenic and very beautiful and was lovely to walk around on a cool Autumn Day. Note:  there are luggage lockers there, some of them are big enough to hold a medium sized suitcase. But there aren’t many of them. The switchback train station nearby also has lockers."
135,Spectacular Garden Setting,Although it was pouring with rain and misty it was well worth a visit. However in sunshine it must be amazing. Such an eclectic mix of styles but wanted to photograph nearly everything.
136,Highlight of Hakone trip,This is a wonderful place!  Great sculpture and nice gardens.  I wish we had had much more time to spend here.  The Picasso building is a great addition.  I also wish adults could play on the kids' play sculptures...
137,Unique museum,"Nature meets art. ¥1600 yen entrance fee. Very lovely gardens with interesting monuments and sculptures throughout and the Picasso art museum.Even if you just have a passing interest in the arts you will find this place very interesting.As the Tozan railway is currently out of action between HAKONE - Yumoto and Gora, it was recommend we ride bus #2 and alight at stop 136, with just a few minutes walk downhill to the museum.I recommend visiting the HAKONE Open air museum."
138,Absolutely incredible and filled with wonderful surprises,Full array of wonderful sculptures from all the famous names around the world all set in delightful tranquil gardens. Beautifully thought through. We loved it
139,"Gorgeous gardens,amazing artworks and a hot spring foot bath!","Visited an afternoon in december 2018. I was amazed with how much there was to see. Sadly I had to rush through some parts in order to get back to the entrance in time. Sculptures are carefully placed, facilities well managed and the overall environment is beautiful. I did not have time for the indoor exhibition and the shop, but the day I visited there was a nightly event with lanterns which was very unique and cool.Please allow yourself a minimum of at least 2 hours to visist. I would have liked to have had 4 in order to see everything and visist the shop. All in all a great museum and one of my favorite ones! Really cool to visit during late afternoon/evening."
140,Brilliant ,"Just the most fun you can have outdoors with kids in Hakone. 3 hours of art, foot spa's and kids adventure in spider web climbing frames and hexagonal mazes. A must do. Must."
141,Beautiful place,"Beautifully laid out. Audio guides available. Separate building for an extensive collection for Picasso and an area where you can relax and soak your feet in natural hot spring water. There's a wood 'hive' structure several stories tall with netted curved space just for kids. Go in and up the stained glass, symphonic sculpture!"
142,Amazing museum,"Have not experienced a better display of sculpture.The natural flow as you go around the museum consumes you totally and you can't help but click each of the amazing creations.If you are in Japan, then this is definitely a must do!!"
143,Fantastic! What a treasure!,"We visited this museum with a little trepidation, as it was raining fairly heavily but there was plenty to see indoors in the Picasso exhibition and we wandered around the display of sculptures outside with raincoats and umbrellas and thoroughly enjoyed the morning. It was beautifully and thoughtfully laid out. A lovely surprise."
144,Must visit in Hakone,"It was a cold, wet and overcast day so we decided to visit this gem.  Well worth the price of admission with a beautiful layout that delivered new pieces after every turn. Good way to spend a few hours at a leisurely pace."
145,Stunning & Majestic ...,Beautiful 2 hours spent here. We were glad we went early because it was getting busy by the time we left at 11:30am. Beautiful surroundings and interesting sculptures. The Picasso display was really well done.
146,Amazing artist œuvre.,This museum of modern sculptures (and more) is amazing. It’s a serious highlight of the Hakone area.  Wow!
147,Modern Art In A Glorious Setting,"This is the first time ever that I enjoyed seeing sculptures a lot. I fell in love at this place!! It's definitely more than just a museum. They have everything, from interactive rooms and amazing play areas where family can enjoy (young, teens, and adults), to the beautiful scenery with wonderful crafted structures. It just relaxing in the eyes. The foot bath is a huge plus. For me, the Picasso museum is the highlight of this place. Who would've thought that 300 of Picasso's original artworks are stored in this place in Japan.Perfect setting and wonderful place to see!Elementary school kids and below can enter for free on weekends. They have lots of parking space (indoor and outdoor). Don't forget to validate your parking ticket once you pay for the admission fee so you don't need to pay a dime for parking. Everything is at reasonable price. Highly recommended!"
148,Be warm & enjoy!,"They have a nice collection of Picasso in addition to outdoor sculptures by French, British and Japanese sculptors. There is even one by an artist from South America. Green grass and mountains give it a very unique appearance. I would recommend this place even if it is raining."
149,A nice stop en route to our ryokan,"Avery big Open Air Museum with so many sculptures, paintings, and large art objects. It even have a Picasso Museum. A must see when in Hakone."
150,Quality exhibition,Worth the trip. We caught a bus and had a short 15 minute walk to the museum. It was hot so take water if going this time of year. Beautiful landscape with sculptures aplenty as you walk through the museum. The Picasso museum is indoors however I really enjoyed the outdoor pieces. A must see in Tokyo.
151,A must do/see when you are in the area.,"The Hakone Open-Air Museum is a very nice modern sculpture park/museum.  The museum itself is quite small, but the sculpture park is quite large.  There is a lot to explore.I arrived shortly after it rained... Blue sky with mixed clouds... It was beautiful.    It is not too difficult to get to, but does take a hour or so to get to from Odawara.  I would plan on 3-4+ hours, including travel time to/from Odawara"
152,Fantastic art,"This was an amazing experience. The art was perfectly selected for the setting, it was engaging as well as entertaining. And the walk thru the park to experience the next masterpiece was wonderful. Loved to learn more about Japanese sculpture which were well placed among the well known international sculpture artists."
153,Nice modern museum,"This is a unique museum - both the site (open air park and garden) and the selection of outstanding exhibits, including some mobile ones and interactive ones. Even people who don't like museums will enjoy this one. Do not miss. Allocate half day at least."
154,Stunning setting,I dragged my husband and child here and they ended up thanking me. It was a gorgeous exhibit. Even though it was so HOT while we were here we still enjoyed our day. My only criticism would be the lack of food choices available. Had I known I would have packed some snacks.
155,An afternoon,We’re not avid art fans but had been advised to visit the open air museum and so glad we did. A lovely park setting and fabulous sculptures. Well worth a couple of hours
156,"Stunning, one best in world sculpture collections","This is an absolutely beautiful collection of important art, cleverly displayed in a gorgeous outdoor setting. It is a highlight for any trip to Hakone!"
157,Nice park and art,If you are in Hakone you must go to the open air museum. Original sculptures in a beautiful outside garden to walk around. Unfortunately the Picasso museum was shut due to building work but a temporary exhibition was available in the main building. In the main building were also a couple of souvenir shops which were also worth a look.
158,"Absolutely fabulous, spent hours here",I was surprised to find this place at Hakone. You could spend 1-2 hours just to walk and explore the open air museum with all the unique art works. It is very easy to get to.
159,Highly recommended quirky and fun,I have not expected to find such a great collection of Picasso's graphic works here. The park of sculptures has a number of interesting pieces as well.
160,Amazing outdoor sculpture gardens and art museum,The open air museum tries to harmonize art and its natural surroundings through well placed artefact's. It has several sections of open air art and some indoors including moving exhibitions and a children's area. The Henry Moore is among the well known open air artefact's while Picasso's large collection has created a nice indoor space for viewing too.Its a fascinating place to spend a day enjoying its scenic beauty and the art within. Ticket price is over 1000yen per head
161,Don't miss this!,"We almost didn't go because the weather was cold, windy and rainy but we had an amazing time. It is not like a typical sculpture garden. It is beautifully laid out. Very architectural and filled with unexpected works of famous artists including an entire building devoted to Picasso ceramics. Who knew! Don't miss it if you are in the area. PLan to spend at least a morning or an afternoon. It'll be a highlight of your trip."
162,Totally worth it! ,"After exiting the Ticket Entrance/Cafe/Shop building you emerge onto a flat paved area with a few sculptures as a teaser. To the left is an exhibition building hosting the temporary Picasso Museum. Entry if free but you have to show the attendant your Park ticket. This exhibit is a bit sparce (temp) and was a little disappointing. At this point, consult your Map and plot a route through the beautiful gardens, there is an abundance of exbibits to see in any direction. The outdoor nature of the exhibits allows you to see them from any and every angle. Don't forget to look back occasionaly as surprise views often become apparent. The mobile exhibits can fascinate for ages. A number of the exhibits are interactive which can be a diversion for the children. The park is steep in places but can be navigated at a steady pace, with park benches throughout for resting. The backdrop of the Mountains adds to the beauty of the place. Allow 3-4 hours minimum to fully appreciate this park. The Chokokunomori station is very near the museum, just a short walk of a few minutes away. A station ticket machine is located just inside the Open Air Museum ticket hall, at the Exit end."
163,Well worth a visit,"I've never seen an outdoor museum, and due to them having a large Picasso exhibit (Inside of course), I wanted to visit. Some of the sculptures are really nice, and others you would mistake for something Ghibli came up with. The Picasso area was modern and well laid out, with hundreds of his works.Further down, there are onsen foot baths, where you can also buy a small towel for 100 yen. I bought 2, as they have the museum name, and I wanted to keep one dry and bagged as a souvenir.It was a neat experience, but not one that I think I'll go to again."
164,Great collection,Words cannot describe this place- just go and experience it- Picasso exhibit now open. Easily accessible from train ( cable car) after rope way- complete circuit starting at pirate cruise ( Tozan railway currently closed due to track damage post typhoon)
165,Surprisingly awesome,We had done our day visit around Hakone and were on the train heading back to the Gora then to get the rope way back over the mountain to our hotel. I had read up on the museum and we had a spare 1.5 hrs. so we dropped in. It really needs at least 3 hours to see it all. The grounds are amazing the artwork as so unique especially the interactive children's art. The Picasso display is a must visit section the stories and the works are excellent. Best if it's dry but in the low light on our visit it gave it a special feel.
166,In the mist,"A large area to walk around, need to be properly dressed to enjoy it on the mountainside..def worth a visit, some very stunning features to be enjoyed!"
167,Amazing in every sense,"While we have always seen art in galleries, this was the first open air art gallery, we had seen.Give it atleast 2 hours to explore it peacefully."
168,Open Air Art Museum,"I wish I had at least two days, which is required to appreciate the art here in this museum. They advertise the ceramic pieces by Picasso, but this place is much more than that. I have attached a few photos to illustrate. The fact that it is open air, it doesn't take you away from the beautiful nature of Hakone. Don't miss this place."
169,Japan Holiday,"This museum presents a rich collection of statues sculcted by  famous artists from all over the world. More,there is a pavillion dedicated to Picasso showing a nice and representing sempling  of his works and another pavillion housing  tha famous ""Kiss"" by Brancusi and the chairs are the wishbone model..No doubt ;spending there  a few hours was not wasting my time"
170,"Not cheap, but neither is a Picasso. And take a small towel.","This is a truly mind-blowing outdoor sculpture museum (make sure you go on a day with good weather, though). Even the journey there (if you take the train) is spectacular... and the collection is huge and world class. There is even a maze of bushes that you can get lost in! I would put this in the top 10 places to visit in Japan... or maybe top 20, anyway --- especially if you are art-interested but also like to be outdoors. Note: It is 15 years since I went there last time (I took many people there, both friends, family and tourists, over the years, though). I didn't have the possibility to choose a date older than March 2018, however."
171,Large open air museum with internationally renowned artists' installation arts,My family and I (kids 9 and 12) loved this museum. There was heaps for the kids to do and the climbing net (up to 12 year olds) was a massive hit. We attended on a wet day but it was well worth the visit. It’s only a very short walk from the closest train stop.
172,Enchanting sculptures in park-like gardens,Dropped by on a chilly cloudy day. Was extremely surprised by the quality and extent of modern sculpture set in an idyll well maintained garden with lots of trees and flowers.  Great place to spend the day.
173,Great Place to Visit ,This is simply one of the best art museums I ever have visited! The quality of the items are extreemly high.
174,Outstanding sculpture park,"One of the most unique experiences in Japan! We had chosen this as the location we wanted to visit in the Hakone region. While the original forecast was for rain, we were so happy to wake up to a sunny day. The museum occupies a beautiful spot and the installations are superb. We really enjoyed our visit. As an aside, the lockers outside the museum are free -- you get your 100 Yen back when you recover your bags from the lockers."
175,Not just Picasso,This museum makes you feel the art in different ways! But the best ones are the ones made for the kids! This definitely makes the kids fall in love with the art around them! This place is a must if you come to Hakone !!!!
176,Great afternoon out.,Don't miss this wonderful collection of artwork when visiting the Hakone area. It has an extensive collection of sculptures and a separate building dedicated to a collection of Picassos.
177,Incredible Sculpture Park,"The Hakone Open-Air Museum is a great place to get away from the big cities and have a relaxing outdoor walk, surrounded by world-class modern art. The setting is wonderful. Admission includes the indoor Picasso museum. Close to a Shinkansen station and the town of Hakone. It's on my ""must see"" in my new book, MORE JAPAN FOR LESS."
178,Excellent place to vidit,Unique and beautiful ....the getting there is part of the thrilling adventure. Even though  its been 5 years it was a lifetime thrill.
179,The best place to visit with kids in Hakone. ,"We went to this ‘museum’ just as it opened (9am) on a Wednesday morning. It was pretty warm but cloudy. We couldn’t believe what a high quality gallery/museum this is. The sculptures are nearly all outdoors, so maybe if it’s scorching hot or wet or cold it might not be as good, however when we went it was perfect. Also, we felt that we had the place almost to ourselves for the first 30 mins, which was really special!The garden/landscaping is superb and as you go around you discover new delights around every corner. I know this sounds cheesy but it’s true. I’m no sculpture buff but I found plenty of interesting and exciting pieces.Coffee at the lovely air-conditioned cafe was top notch. It’s also worth noting that the museum has luggage lockers out front for a deposit of 100 yen. We went on our last day in Hakone and we stashed our luggage here, saw the museum and then had lunch before collecting our bags. We spent 2.5 hours looking round. Couldn’t recommend it highly enough."
180,It’s okay,Surprisingly extensive collection of sculpture. Lots of Henry Moore. Picasso exhibit is really cool - lots of ceramics and other media. Cool kinetic sculpture as well.
181,Wonderful ,"This is an extraordinary collection of sculpture presented in an extraordinary environment. The gallery grounds are Japan at its finest and they showcase the collection to perfection. The scale of the gallery means that the crowd is very well absorbed and while I know it must get much busier than the day we were there the layout of the grounds mean that you are not crowded out by others viewing the collection. The Picasso Gallery provides a real insight into his prodigious output and relates stages in his work to influences at certain periods of his life, particularly the effect on old age on his depiction of those around him. As with all such places in Japan the Museum is well resourced with a splendid café and a shop with a wide range of tasteful merchandise. The only place I can recall enjoying such accessibility to the art is the Guggenheim in Bilbao. This is an absolutely essential part of your visit to Hakone. Its proximity to Gora Station puts it at the heart of the local transport system so there is no excuse not to get there. Put it on your 'must do' list."
182,Well Done!,This is a special place to visit with it Picasso exhibits in a special building. There is mainly his work donated by his daughter of other that painted artworks. The selection of other outdoor artwork make this a must stop on the train up the mountain. We had a very sunny day which made it particularly enjoyable after having been in Yokohama for the three day prior.
183,Open Air,"Lovely place. Architecture, grounds with statues, little Picasso museum. Nice attention is the foot bath at the end of the visit.However, for someone who has issues with his knees like me, too many steps. If you're physically disabled, don't even try. Not good."
184,Beautiful outdoor art installations,"Beautiful park, curious sculptures, so much to see - I'd say it's a must-visit in Hakone!The Picasso pavilion is a dream!"
185,Stunning,"We arrived in the rain and weren’t sure what to expect but were delighted with our visit. This is a really lovely park, well laid out in a stunning location, beautifully maintained with fab sculptures - Henry Moore, Picasso, Barbara Hepworth etc. Some very quirky pieces and fun areas specially for children. We had a great couple of hours and it was our favourite place in the Hakone area. Our only criticism is of the cafe which was large, clean and modern but sold hardly anything and what they did have was overpriced. They are missing a trick here - it could be so much better,"
186,Lovely relaxing walk in Hakone,"What a great place to visit. Fresh air, world class exhibits and scenery to compliment a leisurely couple of hours walk. The Picasso centre was amazing- so much to see and learn about the artist. Not usually a great fan of museums, but this was a memorable morning excursion- and no crowds was a bonus. Would go again."
187,"A highlight on the Hakone circuit, although not included in the Hakone Freepass (Discount only).","I was so impressed with this museum however, I would call it The Hakone Open-air Art Gallery. To access the art you walk around beautiful park like gardens. We had allowed 2 hours to view what we thought was a museum and found that we had to rush in order to get around. I would have enjoyed a further hour here at least. There are several interactive “art” pieces that children could play in as well as some fun digital displays. We found the food at the cafe okay but really expensive."
188,Superb!,"Wonderful collection of statues, stunning environment. Restaurants disappointing; Japanese food is so remarkable why approximate Western food is such an inferior way?"
189,Excellent artwork,"I loved it here, it’s definitely worth stopping off if you’re doing the loop! Really amazing outdoor space, plenty for kids and adults alike ... I went first thing and found it super chilled and a great start to the day!"
190,Set in stunning landscape & great museum,"Really surprised to see such an extensive open air, modern sculpture collection in the hills of a spa town in Japan. It's absolutely fantastic and easily rivals similar ones that I've seen in the US and in Europe. Absolutely worth a visit, but absolutely be prepared to walk a lot, as the grounds are a bit sprawling and some of the pieces involve making your way up stairs or small hills to get the full effect."
191,Great Museum but Picasso Pavilion is under renovation,This is an open air musrum which literally all the ground are museum.You will interact with the exhibit but sometime the exhibition is you (if you see a black footpath....follow it).A great place for all ages and especillay if the weather is clear.Unfortunatelly the Picasso pavilion is under renovation until July 2019.
192,Outstanding! with one little critisism.,"A great chance to review many great pieces of art including some Picasso works. If you love art, perhaps a full day. Access through the sight can be difficult if you are not mobile. Steep areas and uneven paths. Plenty of photos and suggest starting onsite at 9am to be the crowds and get the morning light. There is some food onsite and a great sushi restaurant adjacent to the entrance towards the bus / train stations."
193,Take the entire day there,Unless you stop off here on the train specifically for this open air museum you will have a job to reach the museumSaying that we viewed it from the train both ways and would have lived to have had the time to go round it but that wasn’t possible due to time
194,Not so easy to get to but definitely worth the journey,"We basically just went to this museum because we had nothing better to do in the pouring rain, but we were in for a big surprise. A truly stunning exhibition of fine art - especially the Henry Moore collection is impressive. And the presentation of the Picasso art pieces and the explanations behind the artwork are great. Also the art designed for children is astonishing. Go there!"
195,Really a place not to miss,The open air museum is a lovely way to spend a morning or afternoon - just make sure you leave yourself enough time to stroll through at a relaxed pace rather than trying to take it all in in an hour.  The artwork is quite varied - from a stained glass tower to sculptures of fried eggs - and is often displayed so that it appears to be coming out of the forest.  Some of it is interactive.  It was worth the trip!
196,Must visit in Hakone,"This is a stop well worth it.  There is an extensive trail system and many facilities...a main gallery, plaza, garden, woods, cafe, Picasso pavilion with activities for kids.  Beautifully landscaped.  And a cafe where you can stop and enjoy a glass of champagne after your hike around."
197,Hidden gem in Hakone,"The Hakone Open-Air Museum, is a MUST visit when in Hakone.       The grounds are quite large and the views spectacular. The juxtaposition of the sculptures, and the mountainous surrounding, defies description.  Make sure you carve out enough time during your visit to ensure you can give this place the time it deserves.       As well as the outdoor exhibits, is the Picasso pavilion, which features an impressive collection of works. There are also two exhibits geared towards children, making this a great place to visit for the whole family."
198,WOW if we only had more time!!,"This is an awesome museum, i imagine it would be just as good for families as it was for us (2 couples).Lots of interesting pieces, lots of world renowned artists, well put together and over a much larger area than i thought."
199,Marvellous,"This was part of our tour itinerary. Was OK but not my cup of tea. The grounds and gardens are beautifully kept, with art works dotted through out. If you are into art, then this is a must, it was a pleasant walk through the museum."
200,Best museum in Hakone area,"In the middle of nowhere is an amazing collection of giant sculptures by world-renowned artists.  Many Henry Moore's and lots of Picasso.  Fantastic.Cafe is OK, clean and serves rapidly but choice is very limited - it's a minor point as one is not here for the food.  There needs to be more options for customers: just hot-dog or cake is not sufficient.  This is a must see if you are in the Hakone area."
201,Fantastic!!,"This is a lovely place to visit.We only had two hours to spare but I would have loved to have spent the day there.On a sunny day which we were fortunate to have one could easily spend the whole day in what is essentially a park. It is suitable for families as there are special play works of art for children and it is suitable for all ages There are coin lockers for stowing haversacks. The works or art are breathtaking ! At the time we visited admission prices were as follows: Adults 1,600 yen,students 1,200 yen,middle school students 800 yen,preschool students free of charge.Students are asked to show identification.Discounts are available for groups and disabled people."
202,Art under the sky,Having seen sculpture parks on all continents this one rates near the top. So many people miss out on this real bijoux. If you like sculpture / art then you will be very glad for taking hours to enjoy the masterpieces!!! We
203,Excellent,"I went to the hakone open air museum twice, and in my opinion this is the most beatiful place on the planet. The art works are varied and interesting (by both japanese and western artists), the view is amazing and the curation is perfect. The combination of nature and art at it's best!There is also a foot bath where you can soak your legs in hot water."
204,Must see if you visit Hakone,"Definitely a place to visit when you are in Hakone. We are lucky to still have cherry blossoms as this is already towards the end of the blossom season there. The sculptures are gorgeous and blended well with the nature. Please note that the Hakone free pass only gives you 200 yen discount to the museum, not free access."
205,Loved it!,"Hakone is a wonderful place to visit and trying out all the various modes of transportation to get around was a unique experience.  Arriving at the Open-Air Museum was a highlight of our day and although the weather was cold and windy and things weren't very green yet, it was fun to explore.   Worth the effort to stop by for sure... our kids enjoyed the many visual/experiential surprises throughout the museum."
206,You can spend half a day there,"I generally like museums, but this open air attraction contained only one original house. All of the others had been rebuilt and were shops selling craftwork and other knick knacks."
207,Outdoor Art Museum,Dozens of modern sculptures outside in a magnificent setting.  Unexpected pleasures.  Allow two hours to get through.
208,Wow. Not to be missed! ,Very nice and worth the priceNice Picasso PavillionVery nice and entertaining also for kids who can play Nice walk through the gardens
209,Amazing Sculpture Park,"Awesome unique museum! Took the local bus here without problems. Admission was around 1600 yen w/ discount to 1400 yen w/ the Hakone Free Pass. We enjoyed walking around the grounds and seeing the interesting sculptures. Our kids loved the 2 big play structures in the museum and we had to pry them away when it was time to leave. We had lunch at the more formal sit down restaurant in the museum. Had tasty pasta, although it was a little expensive."
210,Awesome !!,"Despite record breaking and debilitating heat, this museum was a winner. We went on a whim and loved it. Incredible sculpture outside plus an opportunity to soak your feet outside,"
211,Worth the visit,"We visited as it was en route to our hotel and we needed to kill a few hours before check in. It’s a lovely place. There are lots of sculptures around but also other interesting things like a walk by the fish pond (you can feed the fish), and a hot springs bath for your feet (souvenir towels are available for $100 to dry with). A civilised way to spend the morning."
212,Hakone,"We've been to quite a few open-air style museums around the world (Storm King, Meijer Garden and Mass Moca). This one takes the cake! Endless sea of incredible pieces, you can easily spend an entire day here exploring."
213,Must see for art lovers in Hakone,"Beautiful open air museum, lots of sculptures and many kids are able to play on which is great. Also some building with collections of artworks, including a Renoir and many Picassos. The foot onsen is great for a rest after so much walking. Highly recommend."
214,Exceptional surprise,"A taste of what Japan is like x2 and better than Tokyo x10. This museum is super cute, and located in amazing part of scenery. Definitely go- it is a lot more interesting than what is sounds."
215,OMG amassing world-class exhibits in Japanese garden setting - you must see this,Visited the Open Air Museum on a rainy day in Hakone. Still thoroughly enjoyed it. 1600 yen entry (200 yen discount with Hakone Free Pass). A lot of different sculptures to see and a gallery dedicated to the work of Picasso. Well laid out. Cafe onsite with very basic food and drink. There are a couple of sculptures children 12 and under can climb through.
216,Excellent visit with children,"Amazing grounds with a broad range of modern/traditional, Eastern/Western sculpture. Not to be missed."
217,A delightful surprise,"I loved, loved, loved the Hakone Open-Air Museum. Easily accessible by the train (a train with awesome views by the way) - this museum is a must see if you're going to visit Hakone. Admission is 1,600 yen for adults and it's worth it. I went solo, but it also looked like there were a lot of fun activities for kids throughout the grounds.Even if you're not big on art, it was just a beautiful place to walk around in. There is a small lake on the grounds, a few garden areas, and the view from the top of the Symphonic Sculpture was amazing. If you're big on Picasso they have a great Picasso Collection including paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, and more."
218,Educational walk in the park,Great visit with our 13-year-old (who pretended to be 12 to climb on the kid art structures and loved it). Really enjoyed the view from the top of the tower.
219,Open Sculpture Museum,"We were lucky to be there on a dry day, I wouldn't recommend visiting on a very wet day because almost all of the sculptures are outside. I thought the range was very impressive and include several Henry Moore's & and at least one Hepworth (so the British were well represented). I must be the only person who wasn't very keen on the Picasso gallery, it just seemed to be a collection of unimportant pieces. The gardens were lovely but needed a bit of work (especially weeding).We enjoyed the buffet lunch in the restaurant - basically eat as much as you wish from a very substantial number of options including serve yourself ice cream for a reasonable price.It's possible to get there using the Hakone Tozan Train so you could take the opportunity to both ride the switchback train and visit the museum."
220,Good art collection,"A superb, very modern outdoor setting for displays of internationally renowned sculptures.  From Henry Moore, August Rodin, Japanese, American and other artists set in a beautifully crafted landscape setting.  We liked it so much we went back a second day to show one of our travel party that missed our first tour there.  The first day was sunny and hot (Brilliant conditions) The second day windy and wet - diffinitley better on the first day.Some of the art displays are specifically designed to encourage young children to play <12 - I'd recommend taking the train ride from Hakone - Yamoto which is great fun - Its a small narrow track train that weaves its way up the hill to the museum.The restaurant was a bit of a disappointment - great views but very average food"
221,Outdoor,"We planned on visiting this sculpture park as part of our stay in Hakone/Miyanoshita. We arrived by train ( 2 minute walk) around 10.30 and stayed for at least 2 hours as the teenagers were getting restless, I could have stayed for another hour at least, what a feast for the senses. The setting is fabulous and the range of sculptures from great artists from around the globe was incredible. The Picasso exhibition was excellent with some great photography featuring the man himself. The Henry Moore collection was also a standout.There really is something for everyone here,even the youngest of kids with a koi pond, playground style sculptures and great parklands as well as the jaw dropping collection of sculptures.The park gets busier later and there were a few school groups visiting when we did, so an early start would be recommended. The admission cost was modest and there were plenty of drinking water fountains dotted around. Don’t miss it, this is a World Class collection!"
222,Well worth visiting!,"We visited the open air museum in February 2019.  Based on the tripadvisor reviews, we had high expectations and were not disappointed.  The museum is easily accessible via train or taxi.  We took a taxi to the museum from Tonosawa which only took a few minutes (but was pricey).  Getting there early is worth it, because by noon the crowds and the tours arrive.  On the way back to our ryokan, we took the train.  The station (Chokokunomori) a short walk away from the museum. Even though we visited in the winter, it was pleasant to walk around.  A very nice surprise was the koi pond that had several large and friendly koi fish.  For 5 yen, you can buy a small cup of food to feed the koi. We did this twice.  The outdoor installations are varied and fascinating, and there are lots of opportunities for excellent photographs.  We walked around for about three hours, so you probably need at least that amount of time to enjoy most of the exhibits.   While we were there, the Symphonic Sculpture (stained-glass tower) was covered in tarp, and we thought it was closed until we say people walking up the stairs.  Do not miss this, it’s incredible.  There was also a fun exhibit that superimposes a picture of your face onto several animated avatars on a big screen… This museum has a lot of fun surprises! The food options didn’t look that great (especially for vegetarians), but there are some nice little restaurants a few minutes walk away from the museum.  This is definitely a must visit in Hakone."
223,Amazing,It is the first open air museum of Japan. It has got sculptures of many well known sculptors including picasso. It takes much more longer to see all of it compared to the time tour copmanies plan
224,Extraordinary collection,"We were a little bit reluctant to sacrifice time on a busy day to visit this museum, but it was absolutely worth every minute. The layout of pieces is gorgeous, and the Picasso museum is one of the most interesting we have seen anywhere. The grounds are just as spectacular as the art."
225,Memorable,"This was an excellent stop in Hakone region. A first class museum with Picasso, Henry Moore, Rodin, Brancusi , Calder  and others most displayed outdoors in a spectacular mountain area. There even was a foot bath to relieve your weary feet"
226,Wonderful Outdoor Sculpture Garden and a terrific Picasso Museum,"We came here during our one day in Hakone. It was easy enough to find. The price getting in seemed a little high at first, but there were more things to see than we expected. We stayed at the museum for about 2 hours. I wouldn't go back again, but if you're in the area it's a decent place to visit."
227,A wonderful Museum,"Very nice garden setting, art to discover and explore (and climb on, if you are 12 or under). We spent more than 2 hours here and it was clearly more than worth the visit."
228,Nice visit ,"I have been to this museum twice.  Once ten years ago.  It was a great experience then and when I had the opportunity to visit again, I went again.  It was truly as great as an experience as the first time and even better because it was not as hot as I had gone in June the first time.  The September weather was perfect.  The artwork was beautiful and landscaping and views from the museum was fantastic.  I especially enjoyed the Picasso Pavilion which I did remember well from my first visit!  Do not miss this museum!"
229,World Class museum,"If you are near Hakone, visit this museum.  It is beautiful and interesting.  Probably not a good option for a very cold or rainy day.  We all enjoyed ourselves and spent about 4 hours at the museum."
230,Perfect way to spend an afternoon,"We arrived in the area well before check-in time so, after leaving our bags with the delivery service in Hakone-Yumoto we took the train here.  It was a pleasant way to spend a couple hours enjoying the area as well as the art. The Picasso building was closed when we were there.  It is a great place to bring kids, as they have two large artworks that are essentially playgrounds for kids, a lot of fun to watch."
231,Real WOW,"I’m (we) are not the must active guest on museums around the world, but maybe we will begin to visit more, after this. It was so beautiful and peaceful. Still it entertained our kids (5 & 10). Go there, if you have the chance."
232,Magnificent outdoor gallery ,Perfect setting for my now 7th favorite art museum on the planet.  Each turn provides a perfectly placed sculpture for visual delight and contemplation.  Plenty to see to justify effort required to get there.
233,great place to spend for leisure,"This is a very nice and good ""museum"".  For the accumulated wealth of Japan in past decades, give them credit for acquiring priceless art, and paying tribute to western culture.  The Picasso pieces are especially worth seeing.  Not at all hard to get to, even if you don't drive, there are buses easily reachable.  The cafes and souvenir stores are also very well run, with interesting items,"
234,Open Art Museum,"A must if in Hakone, especially in good weather. One of the most memorable locations for me visiting Japan numerous times over the years. Should have good walking shoes!"
235,great for kids and adults,The Hakone Open-Air Museum is no doubt one of the best art museum we've ever visited! Beautiful art pieces are well presented and the visit route is also well thought and planned. Highly recommended for a family day trip and a great place for kids!
236,Impressive collection,Worth the visit and should be on the bucket list. They close at 1700 and it can take 1½ hours walk around. I rushed around on an hour and would like to go again - you get a discount if you have the Hokone free pass
237,Fantastic Museum ,"I didn't have high expectations, because this is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, but this sculpture garden completely blew me away. We had allocated about 90 minutes, but had to rush through. If I get back, I plan to spend a minimum of half a day. Apparently, a Japanese industrialist from Hakone wanted to endow a ""destination event"" in his hometown. Among other things, he bought Picasso's estate. There is more Asian sculpture than is usual in an American sculpture garden, not surprisingly. But the Western sculptors are represented as well. This garden compares favorably with, for instance, the Hirschorn Sculpture Garden because it has sculpture and beautiful landscaping - which would be less manageable in an urban setting."
238,Incredible Sight,"But most of it was outside. They server really good soft serve ice cream for like 400 yen, defo get some of that. The ticket was cheap I think and they spoke English. Lots of art everywhere and you can look at it.  Pretty good tbh."
239,Beautiful in every way,The Hakone Open-Air Museum is a fabulous place to see modern sculpture by the world's finest artists and to soak your tired feet in a foot onsen.
240,One of the most impressive outdoor sculpture museums in the world,"Hakone is a must see on any ‘ Art Lover’s’ tour of Japan. It’s definitely a day  trip and possibly an over nighter; that is if you truly want to walk the grounds & become absorbed in the collection.  I’ve been there many times over the decades and although it’s expanded, the caliber & breadth of the collection never fails to impress. Like everywhere in Japan, space becomes a precious commodity & this is no exception at Hakone."
241,Super Out Door Museum,"We hadn’t planned to visit this, but when we saw it from the train on the way to Lake Ashi, we elected to visit on our return.This ‘park’ is filled with amazing sculptures, with quite a few by Henry Moore, to name but one well known artist.  But not only that, the exhibits are laid out sympathetically with such serene and amazing backdrops, this gives an additional dimension to the observer.We spent some two hours meandering through the park, amazed and mesmerised at every turn.  We did have a beautifully clear sky with brilliant sunshine which added to the whole atmosphere, although this would still be a ‘must do’ if the sun hadn't been out, although I’m not sure of the appeal if it’d been pouring with rain !Highly recommended."
242,Must,It boggled my mind that such an amazing museum was tucked away in the mountains of Japan. Won’t repeat what a lot of other reviewers have already touched upon — but know that 1 hour is not enough time to see everything. The Picasso building is tucked away in the far corner of the museum; we had spent so much time walking around the front parts of the museum that I felt like we rushed the Picasso building to finish in time. The museum does not accept credit cards for the admission ticket and is very close by to a Hakone train station (which we got to via ropeway and tram). A very unique experience that’s not to be missed if you are an art lover or museum enthusiast. FYI - There are two “hands-on” exhibits that are exclusively catered to kids. I was jealous that adults couldn’t partake in the fun!
243,Nice but issues with access,"There's a discount if you have the Hakone free pass. There are many great sculptures in the park as well as indoor exhibits and activity area (for kids). Kids also have an outdoor diamond maze and a Net of Wood attraction to play in. This time if year, they have a night museum activity which starts at 1645. This transforms the sculptures through the effect of lighting. There is also a warm foot bath. Bring a towel or buy for Y100. 2 hour plus required."
244,Wonderful space for gigantic pieces of art,"We planed on being there for 2 hours. Ended up being there almost 6 hours. Worth the time, worth the entrance fee. Great place."
245,Crazy and fun,Can easily walk to Open Air Museum from Gora (8 minute walk). Great experience especially the Picasso exhibition.
246,Ok if you like shopping,Close to all hot springs resorts.  Easily can spend at least 1/2 day to full day.  Cafe inside for refreshments.
247,Highly Recommended,"Short walk from Hakone Tozan railhead in Goran. Caught a beautiful spring day with the Cherry Blossoms in full display. Gardens are beautiful with spectacular sculptures, walkways, streams and bridges. Lots of interactive venues for children and a relaxing outdoor hot spring foot bath for weary adults."
248,High Art in the Mountains,"I spent 10 days in Japan, and went to a bunch of different places. We waffled on Hakone but ultimately decided to add it and I'm so damn glad I did. It was such a welcome change from the hustle bustle of Tokyo. The open air museum was so lovely. Perfect way to spend an afternoon. Must-see if you're in Hakone. It's a bit more on the expensive side for admission but definitely worth it."
249,Unique experience -well worth a visit.,if the weather is good id suggest a trip to the open air museum and a dip in the foot spa - can get quite misty and rainy at times and there isnt much opportunity to get out of the weather.
250,Art and nature meets,"Offers a couple of nice things to do for the little ones, but at the same time there were some interesting exhibitions for us."
251,Unexpected indoor and outdoor art displays ,Very varied styles of modern sculptures - from the beautiful to the funny via the bizarre and the disturbing. Nice Picasso collection. Good descriptions in English.
252,Not to be Missed!,"Not that big. Sculptures were mild. The stained glass tower was great. Overall didnt seem worth the detour, but if it’s on the way, why not?"
253,A must do,"At first we were just slightly put off by the admission price (3200 yen for two) and that they didn’t take cards, but that changed rather quickly.  The open air museum is absolutely incredible and worth every penny.  The surrounding landscape is a beautiful backdrop to a very well curated collection of art.  There were so many delightful surprises around every bend.  If you have kids, there are two very cool play areas that combine art and play.  Beautiful and interesting.  There are also a couple of indoor interactive exhibits that are fun and worth checking out near the exit.  If you are in the Hakone area, this is a must see!"
254,"Spectacular statues in large, open-air space","This was a highlight of my trip through Hakone. You owe it to yourself if you like art, weird quirky art, or just love walking around outdoors and seeing cool stuff."
255,Make sure you leave enough time to enjoy,"Although we never saw Mt. Fuji... he was feeling shy that day... we got to visit the fabulous Hakone Open-Air Museum. This is one that the kids would enjoy as there are many outdoor sculptures and they can be as noisy as they want. The highlight is the Picasso Museum. Although I had never been a fan of this popular artist, I am now after seeing the wide variety of his work. The Museum itself  is a piece of art too! Great gift shop too."
256,Worthwhile!,"This was the primary reason I wanted to visit Hakone and it lived up to my expectations. A surprising mix of sculpture from around the world set in a beautiful landscape. The Picasso exhibit is unexpected but truly insightful in the way it depicts his life through his art, participating ceramics. A definite 10/10."
257,Best museum in the world,"There are a lot of open air museums and sculpture gardens around the world now, and of the handful I’ve been to this was the best. It’s a large area but the grounds are beautiful and there is a very clear well designed route to guide you between sculptures. There are several interactive play areas for children (also beautiful works of art!) and there’s an on-site cafe and museum about sculpture. A lovely way to spend a few sunny hours appreciating art."
258,"Hakone open air museum, what an eye opening ","Set in the middle of nature, as can be expected in such a place as Hakonne, beautifully landscaped and boasting very good statues.We also enjoyed the buffet lunch at the museum restaurant."
259,Much better than expected!,Definately visit here. This is amazing. Somewhat like Sculptures by the sea (if you are from Sydney). Lots of sculptures in beautiful scenery.
260,Wonderful place,"Well worth the ¥1,600 entrance fee to view Picasso’s works (paintings, ceramics n sculptures) and outdoor sculptures by European and Japanese sculptors. There are also two climbing structures for kids, Curved Space and Woods of Net. Please have your kinds remove their shoes to avoid the potential hazard of kicking others kids in the face. Unfortunately a father of 3 kids refused to comply when we reminded him and we immediately took our grandchild off Curved Space. Fortunately he regained his common sense when I saw him taking his kids shoes off at Woods of Net."
261,A visual delight,"Not into sculptures, but enjoyed the walk and trying to work out what the artist was trying to achieve without looking at the description."
262,Such a stunning setting for a sculpture park ,"A must visit if you are going to Hakone. theres a station close to the museum so one can get off there and just walk a few minutes to get to the museum. There are beautiful works by Picasso, Henry Moore, Taro Okamoto and against picturesque setting. TThere are even installations for kids to enjoy. Dont miss the Koi pond and feed the fish."
263,Fantastic ,"Who'd expect to be  out in the middle of Japan and come across such a wonderful open-air museum which  just for extras also had a Picasso gallery. If you are  in Hakone, don't miss this museum."
264,Way better than expected ,"This was one of my favorite things I saw in all of Japan over a two-week trip.  This different, it's cool, it has a huge Picasso art collection, it has an outdoor foot bath, a large coy fish pond where you can feed them, cafes, and tons of outdoor art installation.  What is not to love?I spent a few hours here just roaming around and enjoying the massive and unique outdoor sculptures and art and interactive art displays.  Something beautiful is that Hakone is in the mountains of Japan and this outdoor museum really plays to that.  You can look around you and see mountain views while enjoying large, interactive art displays.  This museum is meant to inspire you and make you think.  You interact with this art, you walk around inside of it, you climb on it, that sort of thing. I enjoyed the Picasso collection which was housed in a different building while they renovate the other - it was probably the largest I've ever seen in one place - and I really enjoyed the Symphonic tower you can walk around in and up the spiral stairs for a 360-degree view of the area and the museum grounds. Gorgeous - with a great cafe in the center to stop and take a break and grab a cool drink or enjoy the foot bath.  This was tops for me.  A must do if you are in Hakone."
265,Fabulous Out door Arts Park,"Best picasos best Jerry more best setting, this is / was my best museum experience ever? And I love art and i am over 55!Great for kids and adults alike, take some water and leave plenty of time, expect to take 2-3 hours Cash only at door"
266,Magnificent!,"Make sure you stop off to view the Hakone Open-Air Museum, an easy 2 minute walk from Chokoku-no-mori station, just before Gora.  Art installations, famous works of art, statues, water features and foot bath, places for children, and amazing natural beauty.  Great value and save if you show your Hakone Free Pass too."
267,Great place to visit. Beutiful sculpture.,"A delightful way to spend a couple of hours. We cut the teenager loose right after we got in - she told us later ""it was good"". This meant the wife and I got to stroll around at a leisurely pace. I'm not a huge art aficionado, but there was plenty for me to enjoy. Aside from the art, the landscaping is lovely, and the views are magnificent. Stopped after climbing the symphonic tower to soak our feet in the free hot spring, and then relaxed with an iced coffee in the cafe next door. We're a bit too old to climb in the wood of net or the diamond structure, but found out later the teenager snuck into both. The water feature was lovely, and food was available to feed the carp.Well worth the entry fee!"
268,Amazing ,Definitely worth a visit ! They have a student fare and you can get a discount with the Hakone Freepass. Such a nice area to walk around and the Picasso exhibit is very interesting!
269,Fun and inspiring!,If you are in the area this is likely the one place you do not want to miss. Wonderful art with a great walk what is not to like?
270,unbelievable experience-why isn’t it more famous?,"In its various exhibition halls, this spectacular museum features paintings, sculptures and ceramics by world-renowned artists such as Picasso, Henry Moore, or Takamura. A particular highlight are the 120 sculptures spread throughout its imaginatively constructed gardens and walkways."
271,An Interesting Place To Visit,This was a stop on my tour and I didn’t know what to expect. I was blown away by the huge and beautiful grounds containing so many world class art installations. A few were targeted for kids. The Picasso exhibit was also extraordinary.  Our tour group stayed only one and a half hours. I would have stayed twice that long if I could have.
272,Well worth the trip,"I don't know how to begin to describe this place. This place is a dream. Even if its raining, this place is worth a visit because the mood is different at different times, thus how you see it, also changes."
273,Really nice place to go with kids,"This has to be in your Japan bucket list.  Simply amazing!  A bit pricey to get in, but worth it.  Great shop too!  Take your walking shoes .. there is a lot to see!"
274,A nice place,"We didn't realize Hakone is a bit of an art focused region, and the Hakone Open-Air Museum should really be considered one of the finest sculpture gardens in the world, with a hundred or so Picassos thrown into the bargain. This is worth every yen and two to three hours of your time."
275,Picasso and more!,"The most unexpected array of thought-provoking, emotion-provoking sculptures are in a small mountain area of Japan! Crazy but true. I took so many pictures just to be able to keep looking at them well after our visit. There is a Picasso exhibit here that is interesting (no pictures allowed of those works) and the cool layout over a vast property made it a wonderful place to get some fresh air and feel a little more off-grid to allow time for reflection and admiration of some truly remarkable works of art. So worth the day we set aside to go to Hakone while in Japan!"
276,Art in great environment,We brought the hakone pass and extra discount when you show pass to buy the open musuem tickets.Spend around 2-3hours there. Is very big.
277,A highlight of our trip,"This was our first stop on our trip after arriving at Haneda, train to hakone yumoto and then by bus to open air museum (OAM). We printed the discount coupon available on the internet and saved 100yen. The bus stop was right in front of the museum entrance. We spent around 1.5 hours here. The displays were very good, interesting and unique. It's a worthwhile place to visit and spend time absorbing the works.Had tea coffee at the cafe and there was a foot bath. Just need to pay for the towels at a dispenser. After the excursion, we walk back to the same bus stop and took a direct bus to Gora where our hotel is. Every thing for ghid first stop on our itinerary worked out according to our expectations. It's our first trip to hakone and we heard so much and read so much about this OAM and we're not disappointed at all. A must see for any first time visitor to hakone."
278,Amazing!,"“Well, we’re not going to see Mt. Fuji,” we figured; “may as well do something else instead.” This museum was a fabulous surprise. In addition to an excellent indoor Picasso exhibit, there is: a huge climbable tower completely made of colorful glass mosaics; two (!) gigantic amazing play areas for children (actually works of art, doubling as playgrounds); some Alexander Calder pieces; Sfera con Sfera (see Wikipedia); a foot bath, cafe, restaurants, gift shops; and of course several interesting sculptures, some mobile.No point going in the rain, but perfect for a cloudy day.Extremely highly recommended!"
279,worth a visit,Who would've thought a small town would have a museum/collection like this. Well worth a visit.  Jump off the tram in this small town
280,The day was too hot but it was well worth a visit to the outdoor sculpture gallery,You can take the Hakone-Tozan line to reach this museum.  It's one of the area's top attractions.  In a leafy hill setting you find this open air museum for modern art.  They have an impressive collection.  If you have a Hakone Freepass you get a reduction.
281,The Hakone Open-Air Museum,"A must go for the art lovers. Entrance fees apply and is not included in the Hakone pass. Lots of sculpture and a museum which hold Picasso art works. It was raining when we visited. Was cold, wet and foggy and made the walking less bearable. Nonetheless, highly recommend this place."
282,Beautiful and original,Take the train if you can - we had to get off in Yumato and take the H bus to about 700m from the Open Air Museum.  This is a 2 hour stop minimum (add more for food) and involves walking around indoor and outdoor sculpture and art that is world-class.  Food is average and fairly expensive on site but the vistas are great.  Great for kids and also for adults.  A good day trip from Tokyo - best to take the Romance train from Shinjuku.
283,Art experience ,"For a non-art aficionado, I think the open air museum had a lot to offer ... well curated sculptures set within the natural landscape, large art works that were actually play grounds for kids, and an educational museum dedicated to Picasso.At 1600yen per adult i has thought it pricey but it turned out to be well worth it."
284,"Loved this, so glad we added Hakone to our stay","Sometimes as you visit places around the world you find a place that is way beyond expectation and you are blown away by the experienceHakone open air museum is one of these.The collection of sculptures is world class but what makes it exceptional is how they are laid out in a glorious mountain setting in a park that has all the hall marks of a Japanese gardenSpace ,setting, beauty. Eye for detail, fun , balance etcWe visited on the most atrocious weather in April with snow sleet and heavy rain and we thoroughly enjoyed it,If you are in this area do not miss it"
285,Impressed Japanese style beauty of art,"This was the highlight stop for us in the Hakone loop. We went clockwise to save this stop for last so we could relax and spend a couple of hours here. The outdoor sculptures are fun and quirky as well as spectacular especially the tower with coloured glass. There’s fun little activities to do like walks underground to look up a hole, climb the glass tower. It’s great for kids a they have amazing playgrounds, us adults were jealous. Picasso exhibition was shown in main foyer as its building is being renovated."
286,Delightful Surprise!!,"This is my second time here, and frankly was the only thing I remember about my last visit to Hakone. It is a wonderful place, which is inspired and inspiring - there is something for everyone. It is an artists’ and photographers’ paradise. Of course, it needs fine weather to fully appreciate, but it is an open air sculpture park after all! There is a lovely cafe, for coffee/lunch and a hot water foot bath sitting area. This is strongly recommended and is on the bus route (short walk), and modestly priced."
287,Museum open air,Open but not in a large area. Give it an hour of enjoyment. You will not regret it. Big and small sculptures.
288,Very well laid out and interesting variety,A great collection of works in a one-of-a-kind setting. I wish I had more time.Thoroughly enjoyable for a day trip to Hakone. Allow about two hours
289,Do not miss,"Not enough superlatives to describe this experience. If you are visiting this area with children (or without) this is a must do. We visited with our 4 kids and spent 5 hours here. It is particularly well set up for kids. There are two brilliant play places plus a hot spring foot spa area, as well as indoor interactive sculpture features. Also nice cafes, a good restaurant and gift shop. Aside from this you will see one of the best sculpture collections in the world."
290,Beautiful Setting,"Give yourself at least 1 1/2 hours, no less, to see all of the attractions at the Open Air Museum. Picasso is a must.  There is  a hot spring to bathe your feet in when they get tired. Small towels are only 100 Yen. Check out the leadlight tower."
291,Fabulous!,"One of the main attractions on the Hakone circuit, although annoyingly not included in the Hakone Freepass (Discount only offered). We visited for a couple of hours on a lucky sunny day in November 2018. There are a few indoor halls, including a Picasso exhibit. Besides that, stroll the outdoor spaces which include sculptures by Moore and Milles, a koi pond with sculptures in it, and a large tower with fabulous stained glass that you climb via a spiral staircase. There's also a modern cafe where you can take a break for a drink or lunch and a unique children's playground sculpture to entertain the kids for a while. Near the cafe, be sure to soak your sore feet in the foot bath -- bring your own towel! I would give 3.5 stars if I could. I thought it was a highlight of the Hakone circuit, but not the most impressive art museum I've ever been to, although somewhat unique. Note: According to their web site, the Picasso Pavilion will be closed until the end of July, 2019, for remodeling. During this period, the Picasso Collection will be displayed in the Main Gallery. Pets not allowed. Audio tour available. I suggest the nearby 'Cafe Bar Woody' for a snack or lunch. If you found this review helpful in any way, please click the 'thank' button. You're the best! ;)"
292,Well worth the visit!!,"Hakone Open-Air Museum is Japan's first open-air museum. It has collections of artworks made by Picasso, Henry Moore, Taro Okamoto, Yasuo Mizui, Churyo Sato, and many others, featuring over a thousand sculptures and works of art. Incredible art in acres of forest, mountain setting."
293,What a lovely place,"The Hakone travel pass gives a discount on entry but still not cheap at 1400 yen per person.The Picasso collection is quite extensive though and we left with a new appreciation of him, his life and his art.Was really relaxing wandering around the rest of the gallery/sculptures, the most of which are large scale and scattered in the open around the grounds.Carry a small towel with you and you can avoid the 100 yen fee to rent a towel and enjoy a hot foot spa.Allow about 2 hrs total, including the short walk from Chokoku-no-mori station."
294,A perfect mix of nature and brilliant art pieces,"If you are visiting Hakone, take some time to visit The Hakone Open-Air Museum. important sculptures, wonderful garden and Picasso Museum with important pieces from the artist.do not missed it!"
295,“Must See” Open Air Treat,"This museum is an easy stop on the train from Hakone-Yumoto to Gora, part of the usual tourist circuit in Hakone.  It’s a lovely space with great and interesting pieces of sculpture and other art in a really big space.  If you enjoy art, this is a great museum."
296,Hakone's best view,"Two hours was barely long enough for this amazing place, especially with two children who didn’t want to leave each of the Kid Art attractions! The museum was really an art gallery, with sculptures scattered around the beautifully kept grounds, with the bonus of a Picasso exhibition building. Even though the weather was a little drizzly, it was still a pleasure to wander the exhibits. For the kids, there were underground stairs, a spider web of ropes, a climbing box, though the maze was closed. On the way to the exit was a chance for the kids (and adults) to be ‘living sculptures’ with three further activities. Even the gift shop was well stocked with a wide variety of items. This attraction doesn’t seem to have the publicity it deserves! It’s a ten minute walk from the Hakone railway station."
297,Great Art Adventure!,"I will put my hand up straight away and admit that this sort of Attraction is not up-my-street. I am a Philistine, when it come to arty-farty stuff.However, with the possible exception of several of Picassos's works, where the reaction of 'Duuurh', 'What-the-heck', 'Really' & 'Nor me' seemed entirely appropriate, I really quite enjoyed it and found some quirky things to entertain and amuse.Easy to roam, get around, spotlessly clean and lots of space. Something for everyone - even Philistines & kids."
298,Must see,Didn't know what to expect. Didn't know anything. Boy were we pleasantly surprised. It was incredibly fun and interesting with many unusual outdoor sculptures by famous sculptors. We spent a good 3 + hours there and were reluctant to leave. Will go back again next time we're there.
299,Highlight of Hakone,"Tip: get a discount with the Hakone Free Pass, additionally the pass will also cover your transportation up via the exciting Hakone Tozan railway as well as other forms of transportation round Hakone.  Students with student passes can also get student discounts.While most travelers come to Hakone for the beautiful scenery, boat ride and osens, this open air museum is worth visiting, whether you are an art lover or not, as it is set in the midst of the beauty of Hakone’s natural surroundings with lush green mountains, valleys, trees and forests as it’s back drop.  On a clear day, the entire environment is breath taking.  Definitely worth a stop as you make your way round the Hakone loop. Most of the amazing art pieces were displayed outdoors, some of them were pretty huge and gigantic but they were also carefully placed in view of the natural surroundings and they were well spread out with lots of open space in between exhibits. There were also indoor exhibits such as a whole building dedicated to the works of Picasso.  Human descriptions do not do justice to the majestic display of art and nature here.  One has to be physically there to experience its grandeur."
