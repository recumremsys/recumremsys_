0,Monument to Pugachyov's ally,"The monument to Salavat Yulayev is a dominant sight and I would sat even the official symbol of Ufa and the whole of the Republic of Bashkortostan.It stands on a high bank of Belaya river.I visted it in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening - in the last rays of the sun."
1,Great Views ,"The horse of this sculpture is the biggest in Russia. The placement of the monument is very thoughtful - it is seen from all  the trains passing Ufa r/w bridge on the way from Moscow to Siberia.At night it looks really impressive,  being nicely illuminated. There's a restaurant in a neighbouring Congress Hall with a stunning river landscape and monument view."

4,Brilliant Monument,"This area around the Salavat Yulaev Monument offers a spectacular view over the Belaya river, a great outdoor area with fountains, the Congress Hall and in walking distance also the Old Muslim Cemetary, well worth a visit. Of course this area should be visited in spring, summer and autumn. The Salavat Yulaev Monument itself is very impressive, built in 1967 it stretches about 10 meters to the sky. One of the biggest horse-riding monuments in Russia, if not the biggest."

15,Very nice place to spend a few hours,"Probably it is the best point to see the lower coast of the Belaya river. From the high place near monument you can see the Russian huge space, impressing autumn time especially"
16,Symbol of Ufa,Great statue of hero from this region of the world.  Great views across the river. If you only go to Ufa for short stay then this is one place to go as a tourist.
17,City break,"Created in 1967 and rated #2 in EU the monument is still one of the biggest. The site is high over the bank of Belaya River and really wonderful - only a little restricted view on West - East and 20 to 40 km view South direction, supervising city surroundings, woodland hills, the Mouth of Dema river and Railway Bridge first constructed more than 110 yeras ago... Remembering our walks here in childhood and schoolyears we often visit the Monument now, wondering with colourful sunsets, small ships far below on the river in summer and and ski tracks on the ice and trees covered with hoarfrosy in winter... YES, it's surely must visit and maybe most remembered place in Ufa."
18,Bashkort national hero,"It you are in Ufa in summer time, this is the place which you have to visit. The view is breathtaking and there are lots of Spice to stroll. Don't miss it"

25,Main atraction of Ufa,"On a snowy February evening we went to see the largest horse statue with a horse standing on three legs (!).  Funny but the horse - and rider, Bashkir hero, Salavat Yulaev - stands tight on the edge of a bluff facing the White River. So close that I couldn't get around to the front to take a better picture. Coming back when the snows gone and it's warm."

29,Nice place and view,"This is very beautiful place with panoramic view to the amazing city. Families, couples, friends, a lot of people go there every weekends and it's very nice watch them. If you want to see Ufa it's better to go there in the summer, because city very green at that time and you can try delicious tartarian food on the open restaurants."
30,Love this place!!!,One of the highlights of UFA city ! Nice to take a walk all around the city....Russia is breathtaking !Recommended !
31,Selfie-place,"Ok, here's a thing for the brides in long gowns - apparently, in Ufa your marriage is not legal, if you were not photographed with your groom in front of this monument. For those not getting married in the city, it's just another horse statue. After all, no one knows what Yulaev really looked like."
32,Great Sites!,"There is actually a bunch of souvenir shops around worth visiting. Right before the monument there is ""yurt"" - a roundish tent. Prices are better than in the hotel. The best thing, actually, is to ask a guide to take you to the largest souvenir shop in city, which is right down the street. There you can take pictures in national Bashkir outfits for free.Decent English-speaking guides are found here ufatravelguide.ru"

39,Symbol of Ufa,"Great panoramic view, nice surroundings, good place to walk, to rest, to make a short visit.         ......."
40,Must-visit,"Simply no choice, but to visit this place while staying Ufa. I would recommend to go there early in the morning, when there are few people around - this will give a positive energy for the whole day. Or you can take a walk shortly before sunset, so you'll be able to take a look on the breathtaking scenery and on the way back enjoy lightened fountains."
41,Must see statue and few across the Ufa rivers,Good place to walk alone or with kids. There are a few huts with non expensive tea and refreshments.
