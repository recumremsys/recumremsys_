27,Great,"Lulu mall is on of the most sought after tourist place for people within the country and outside. You can find almost all the well known brands there. Apart from that the infamous Lulu stores are a big hit. My personal favorite is the Hamley store on the second floor and my mother's favorite is the Hyper market on the ground floor. The lulu stores hold branded goods at discount rates most of the times.The Food Court is also very good and gives you a lot of choices from veg to non veg and from different cuisines. Suggestion: I love Gelitos, it serves Mexican food in different degrees of spiceness and it's absolutely yum!PVR cinemas, with 9 screens on the second floors have almost all the movies running at very convenient timings.One minus of the place is the huge traffic both inside and outside the mall. Hence we chose to go there once or twice a week or if we have absolutely no other choice than booking tickets of a mich awaited movie at their PVR.It's a great place to hangout with friends and waste a lot of time searching for stores also."
28,Best mall in Kerala ,"Metro rail is very convenient, huge crowd when we visited, lulu hyper Market should open more billing counters, I stood more than half an hour..."

They also have few other good restaurants and coffee shop. It's wheelchair friendly, special care for kids and aged are also available. Almost all brands are available and most of the time there will be good offers too. Good for shopping and family outing. PVR is also excellent. They should provide more sitting area on first 3 floors, as people will get tired walking this huge space. In short the best place for shopping and fun in Kerala."
36,Good place to spend time ,"its the biggest  mall in kochi.it host a gaming area , cafeteria  lots of luxurious stores plus movie theatre and a  too much crowded super market.its huge and vast u may feel tired walking all the way through the mall.if u  hate too much crowded shopping avoid supermarket its too uncomfortably crowded..rest all good"

40,Big,"Good for visiting Lulu in case you are visiting Kochi. Its currently the best mall in Kochi. Bit overcrowded on weekends, hence week days are recommended. Ample parking facilities are available but it take bit time to park and move out from parking. One best way will be to come by Kochi metro since there is a direct walkway from mall to metro station."
41,one door to shop n dine,"Easy convenient and connected location for shopping.  Most brand name stores are here. Prices are little high. We stayed at Marriott which is next door so, it was very convenient to get here with a complimentary buggy ride."
42,A taste of affluent India,This is a huge mall and definitely different to the other bigger malls in Chennai or Bangalore or Delhi. The range is quite vast and the Food court is exceptional. Watch out for the parking marks in ensuring not to search for your car after shopping :) It s location is quite out of the busy trafficked roads and relaxing.
43,Avoid on weekends,India's biggest shopping mall keeps it's proud and richness in every aspect. Food courts and park and shopping market are wonderfull

For me, the highlight of the place was the food court having different cuisines served and a lot of variety. I was traveling solo, I sat there having lip smacking food and watching people. Great place especially if you are with family."

Variety of homemade chocolates, and chips. Be careful about the money management, as that's the only thing you will get amazed at the end of the day.

61,Enjoyed,"A stop at Lulu mall in Kochi en route to the airport is a dangerous place to stop. The mall is one of the largest in Kochi and is filled with tempting treasures that are sure to entice you.The mall is set up with specific floors dedicated to men, women, children and food. It doesn’t flow in the same way a standard mall lay out is, however, it does keep your interest. Local shops as well as nationals like Jack and Jones, Vera Moda, Benetton and other big brand names exist as do some unique shops with great stuff.Malabar Gold also has a retail store on the main level. If you are in the market for gold, this is the place to go. The prices are better than the Gold Souk in Dubai and the quality of workmanship outstanding. This is where the real danger exists. You can easily get lost in the extravagance of their beautiful creations and find yourself reaching, willingly, for your wallet.Like I say, this is a dangerous place to stop!Enjoy!!!"
62,Kerala no.1 mall ....,"Lulu mall is an excellent mall in Edapally.It's quite huge and on weekends and holidays it's extremely crowded.I visited the mall twice.A lot of brands under one roof.The food court is good.

66,Average,"Surely Lulu Mall has changed the face of Cochin. It is very nicely built and managed. The customer service is pretty good. We have a variety of shops to shop from. Lulu grocery market also has abundant collection. But I wonder many of their products have the same quality as their stores in the Middle East. In my estimation their fruit collection sucks. Their apples are considerably waxed, their oranges are not tasty and their plantains are stale.The quality of their fish is also questionable. But Lulu Mall is always busy actually too busy and it is hard to expect a relaxing experience."

Such is the popularity of this place."
82,Spacious mall and have Finest Food court,"This mall is apparently there biggest in India and houses all major brands.

The  Lulu Hypermarket is a great place to shop for your house hold items . It will get really crowded in the evening time especially on weekends ,so I urge you to go check in the Hypermarket in the morning hours. The ground floor has a a lot of gold and diamond showrooms . First floor is mainly for the women and the 2nd floor for the men... Although not strictly in that way. The top floor is the food court and has a large area owned by the Sparkeys were you get small rides in addition to all those vedio games that is usually seen in these type of malls.

100,Good,"Located very conveniently on the highways of Cochin, and very near to a Metro station, this massive mall is sure to catch even the most unaware of eyes. And no points for guessing here, it surely is a paradise for shoppers- exactly what it was supposed to be! We have been to a lot of big sprawling malls all over India, but this takes the cake. And here you will find retail outsets of almost all the major brands across all possible product types. And one more thing which is worth mentioning, is that the pickup and drop points of app cabs are convenient and there is enough space for the same. All in all, it is a great place to be from a shopper's perspective! Honestly, we could not visit the entire mall due to paucity of time, since we had a return flight to catch. But if we come to Cochin again, we are surely coming back here!"
101,One Of The Best nd Biggest Mall In Kerala...,"Well done to the management for maintaining a clean mall. Good selection of shops but wish for more international standard restaurants. Staff from security,  cleaners to info desk, were all professional."

106,A real shopping experience,"We visited LuLu Mall in cochin on our last day in Kerala. LuLu Mall is a nice mall with variety of western and Indian fashion stores. We had 2 hours only, in our trip,  to roam around. If you have spare time, then visit this mall. SEE photos"
107,Best but expensive Mall. ,"It is the biggest mall in Kochi. There alot of branded shops,lulu hypermarket, lulu fashion store ,electronic section ,  pvr cinemas, food court and gaming zone. Kids will love the gaming section, which has alot of options. There is ice skating also. There is ample amount of parking space. It's paid parking, they charge higher on weekends. There is another parking space opposite lulu mall near to petrol pump which have standard 10rs or so and is not dependent of number of hours. Lulu mall is very crowded during Saturdays and Sundays."
108,A rather enjoyable shopping experience,"It is hyped. It has a metro station in the mall.  It has options for lifestyle and garment shopping. It is pretty big. But when it comes to crowd, it is unmanageable.  Cleanliness was not upto the mark.  Ventilation was an issue at some places but otherwise it's okay "

145,Huge,"It is a great place to hangout in Kochi's heat .. excellent food options, all brands and play area with excellent rides"
146,Great mall,Lulu Mall is one of the best things in Kochi. I was there when the weather was hot and humid. It is very well laid out mall and couldn't have asked for more from a mall in a city like Kochi.
147,Kerala trip,it's easy to travel by metrostops near the mall(kind of inside the mall)explore the mall by own  with our choice of brandthe food court is full of mouthwatering dishesone can find all sorts of stuff according to the budget of each liking.one kind of itself in India
148,Nice hospitality ,"Enjoy teste of nature... first time in Kerala kochi Turkish magic ice cream “we don’t sale ice cream, we sale happiness "
149,A world of everything......,"I have heard of lot about Lulu Mall many times being one of the biggest in south east Asia. Indeed, it is quite expansive and due I liked it a lot due to its very smart design with plenty of open space which can easily and comfortably accommodate a capacity crowd. It hosts almost all the big lifestyle brands under the same roof. Special mention about its food court as it is really so big! You could plan to spend a full day quite easily without being bored. Definitely this is one of the feather in the glittering crown of Kochi city!!!"
150,The second home,A place where you can find all international brands under one roof. it is the busiest place in kochi
151,Big western style mall with everything,The Lulu mall is one of the biggest shopping malls in Kerala. We had been here for shopping during our trip to Kochi. The mall has almost all popular brands being sold. Overall a nice place to spend a few hours.
152,World of entertainment,"We went to pulp factory, KFC and PVR. Juices from pulp factory was good. All were nice except the long queue for pvr entry."
153,ALWAYS CHECK THE READY TO EAT FOOD,"I happened to stay at Marriott at Kochi. Incidentally LyLy Mall is located just adjacent to it. The ambiance and facilities are too good  infact, what i came to know is that people cone from far off places to visit and satisfy their shopping desires. It is conveniently located near Edepally Metro Station and infact, the mall has a direct access to it. LuLu hypermart is a landmark worth the visit. An excellent place overall."
154,Vacation ,"Visited this place n no.of times for Movies, Dining , Shopping. Irrespective of the huge crowds the mall is kept very clean. Restrooms are neat. Dining areas are cleaned sooner."
155,One of the biggest shopping malls i have come across,Very good mall. Very good upkeep. Not very rush on the day we gone some children had come on picnic. Spacious. Visited hyper marketThe hyper market is one place you get all things
156,Heaven of shopping ,"Nice and tidy mall. All what we need provisions are available. My special thanks to LULU  CONNECT for my electronic needs. Staffs are polite. My rating is based on the cleanliness of the mall, access to metro is an added advantage. My 5 star rating."
157,Good but very crowded,Not s single staff member could give definite and concise directions to shops within Lulu. Cleaning staff literally play fighting in the bathrooms. Other than that this place was great. Could use interactive information system to help shoppers find their way around. I've never been to a mall so nice but with such old antiquated boards for information.
158,One of the biggest mall in asia,"My favorite place for shopping in KochiLulu hypermarket, Lulu connect and all leading fashion brands are in Lulu fashion storeBest place for spent weekend'sPVR cinema's, skating area, rides for children's and food court are give a awesome experience"
159,Nice place for a family outing,"Apparently the largest mall in India, Lulu Mall offers a great variety of shops, an area for kids, a small fun park and great food options. The place is very clean, not too crowded and seemed well managed. Recommended if you have extra time in the city and need to do some last…"
160,A real entertainment,"It became a tourist centre now. Vast area for computerised paid parking. Complete shopping centre, games, skating, food courts etc.."
161,Complete international Mall,"One of the best malls in Kerala as of now. The one thing I see as a lack in here, is the limited number of international food outlets in the food court. The options due to that seem limited. Besides the seating in the food court is also average. Many a times there's already no seat available. This could probably be improved."
162,Best place for shopping at Kochi,My wife and I spent few hours shopping at Lulu mall it was great time and different merchandise with some of local touchThe mall has a relax Enviemantal with nice and clean facility We have luck to have travel show where you got a lot of luggage offers I have got Delsy brand with 45% Lessie here is good The resturent was good it was a little pricy but was great food Some of the global shoes available and has a good items to have in your basket It’s worth to visit and shop Thanks
163,"Amazing visit
To lulu",Located at Edappally Near to Ernakulam with good access by Kochi Metro. One of the biggest shopping mall in India. All major brands. Good food court and children's play area too
164,Jewel of Kochi,Good shopping with plenty of brands and with lot of crowd have plenty parking area for lot of cats and have amusement for kids
165,Largest Mall in South india,"American style huge mall. It has all the international brands I was used to. All the shops took credit cards and the whole complex has AC and wifi. Although I wasn't able to connect cause of some error on the network. It has a very big and impressive food court on the top floor as well as the most fancy cinema I've ever seen. Quiet cheap cinema also 118 rs. for the cheapest ticket. Very easy to reach from Fort Kochi (if you fancy some western comfort on your South India tour) Just get on the ferry to Ernakulam, walk to the metro station Mahajaras and alight at Edappally. The metro stop has a direct connection to the mall so it's super simple and affordable to visit"
166,The best to explore ,"A big, clean mall with a sizeable number of shops. Perhaps one of the key highlights in Kochi. Reasonable rates and you can everything you need from groceries to toileteries, clothes, ethnic wear etc with some famous brands all under one roof. Saves you the time of going to…"
167,"Shopping, food, family-friendly ",Great mall and equally matching to middle east standard interms facilities  and services many branded showrooms for apparels and clothings nice to visit if you have spare hours in you're Kochi  visit
168,So Far My Favorite Mall in the Whole World,One of the biggest shopping mall. I really enjoyed at there. Many many brands shops had there beautiful mall.
169,Best mall in Kochi,Lulu Mall is a great place to  unwind and catch up with the w orld. Most Leading brands and some more are featured here. the days of buying andf bringing home the best  brands from abroad are over.. No more paying for extra baggage . I get most of my westerns in Lulu…
170,A one stop shop,"Pics were not permitted but I did click some from outside. Undoubtedly world class hyper market with choicest of freshly made mouthwatering multiple cusine delicacies sold as take away (except chat and fruit juice)... people thronging and fighting to get Arabian, Kerala,…"
171,Getaways,I was familiar with Lulu Hypermarkets from the UAE but this mall is not on that scale but the mall concept is not so commonplace in India.  This is a great place to find everything in one air conditioned place and I stayed at the Marriott before I left Cochin so I could just do a big shop up!!  This mall is jammed from morning to night so try to get there first thing!  There are plenty of western stores (small marks & Spencer) but all the Indidan stores such as Fabindia and many others are represented as well. Local designers like Rita Kumar all have big store presence.  Lulu itself has several stores that cover not just the grocery hypermarket but also clothing and homewares and electronics.
172,Kerala's international  standard mall,Goods1. Location2. Size3. Lot of brands4. Large food courtBads1. Very average interiors 2. No high end store
173,Mall of Mall,"Lulu I must say is one of the best malls I have been in India. You must visit the hypermarket they have, so well stacked and organized. One would be amazed to see. They have all famous brands available there. Also you will find many things which are famous in gulf countries,…"
174,Good shopping Centre ,Paradise for shoppers..  had visited couple of times.. crowd for offer day is unimaginable.. keep up the good work..
175,Biggest Mall,all brands stores are available at lulu shopping mall in one place u can find all your needs and u can enjoy with ur childrens also and family outing also indoor games zone is togood for child and for young peoples also
176,Amazing experience,"Larger than life experience. Good ambience, variety of showrooms under one roof, PVR & fun world are good."
177,Biggest Mall,Once an excellent mall 7 yearsago when we visited it now is just about the same as any other mall. Some unresolved  issues include - customer  congestion at its hypermarket and traffic congestion at entrance. Shopping varieties are numerous and comprehensive.
178,The Biggest Mall In Kerala,"Malls are places to shop, drink, fine and entertain.Lulu Mall in Cochin is the largest mall in Kerala though much smaller bthan those in SEAsian countries.  Kerala is basically an agricultural state with rice as staple food, coconut products, spices, coffee, tea and herbs.You…"
179,Very good,Middle class families can do only window shopping. The car parking rates should be reduced. Security system not upto world class. Hypermarket items quality is going down. Was good in the first three years.
180,PVR cinema facility @ second floor,"Good place , food court and play areas r good . Aroma thai massages r excellent.  An ideal place to spend ur day on ur own or with friends and family."
181,😍Lulu Mall😍,Over crowded place. Not managed well. Dirty and stinky restrooms. One can get all the brands in any other mall as well. Just because it is one of the biggest is its USP.
182,good and biggest mall in kerala and asia,"Great hangout for friends and family and you have great options for shopping, food, etc. Pls use the metro train since you have stops at the Mall literally"
183,Super hangout,"I enjoyed shopping in the mall.  All kind of brands are represented including US and EU, UK brands. You can easily spend a 2 days there.  Everything is organised in accordance with international standards.  Good food court."
184,biggest mall in kochi,"Lulu mall is a nice place to visit. You can find everything under one roof. Clothes, jewellery, home decor, food, movies, entertainment etc. Wise varieties of shopping outlets. Caters to all sorts of people."
185,Bringing Middle Eastern quality to good 'ol Kerala,"If you are an Kochi and you are just a bit interested in shopping you should not miss this Mall. We read about this Mall, but we didn't expect such a big shopping Mall. Even the food court usually not always recommended in a Mall offers wide variety of food."
186,PLACE FOR SHOPPING AND FUN,"Lulu hyper mall is a place where one can be spoilt with choice. I have been there number of times and has been witness to slow and steady deterioration of quality of the staff present. While they used be very professional and on-the-job earlier,  now I seesl them indulging in banter and fun and talking among themselves, at times not bothering even answering to the query of the customer.The sad part is that when that I went and asked floor guys where a specific item was kept he send me in the opposite direction.Whether it was done wilfully or by mistake, it doesn't matter because both are equally bad for the business.The size of the hyper mall may be thinning out attention of the supervisors on the staff.It doesn't augur well for such a beautiful organisation. Hope someone takes note and initiates remedial measures required"
187,A Dangerous Place to Stop,"Food lover's must try chicken shavarma in hyper Mart in Lulu mall.... Lulu fashion, paragon restaurant, electronics, items etc  Top floor waiting for children.... Games zone there...  All the very Best to you...."
188,Great selection,"One roof you get everything you need that's the beauty of shopping in lulu mall. Supermarket of excellent quality stuff.Food joints, movie theaters, Gold jewellery artificial jewellery , cutleries ,Readymade itemaMaterialskids will enjoy  , you name it .one stop for your entire…"
189,Massive Mall,It's a great hangout place with friends. But very crowded too. Shopping is expensive. But LuLu hypermarket is worth it.
190,Well connected mall,"Lulu Mall, Kochi is easily the best mall in India. It is so huge and you can get everything you want."
191,Lulu Where Kochi Meets,This Mall has been over-hyped for everything. Extremely crowded on Weekends and very much crowded during the week days. PVR has 9 Screens and you get to see all latest releases of all languages. Recommended to visit ONLY if you have specific needs for shopping / movie.
192,One stop shop! ,"The highlight of my weekly adventure in Lulus was the international Hypermarket. Over three-floor within Lulus Mall. The aisles are wide and spacious with every conceivable product available. From bedding to freshly made Indian sweets. Hypermarket in the mall is one-stop-shop for all your needs. Lulus is one of the biggest malls in the Indian sub-continent. The mall has a total of 5 floors, which includes a 9 screen cinema multiplex, a 1500 seater food court, over 300 national and international brands and over 215 outlets. In addition, there are plenty of facilities for entertainment like an indoor climbing wall, ice skating rink, 5D Cinema, arcade gaming zone, rides, a party hall and a 12 lane bowling alley. There are also business facilities, Foreign Exchange Counters and Banking Counters. The mall also accommodates a 300 room 5-start hotel.   At Lulus Mall the international Hypermarket was a unique experience in customer care and service which echoed idyllic supermarket experiences from 1960s movies. I loved It!!"
193,International mall with easy metro access.,Best place to kill your weekend/free time... a wide variety of shops with many top brands and state of the art services. A well maintained arcade
194,Distinctly average ,I visited Lulu mall anticipating that it would be different and worth a visit as it is the largest mall in India. However the mall is a bit confusing and is just like any other mall with same brand outlets as any other mall. If one has spare time to kill one may visit it but tourists on relatively tight schedules should avoid going to Lulu mall. You might be able to visit something more meaningful in that time.P.S.- I have nothing against the mall in particular but I did not see anything outstanding to make a place worth a visit(especially for tourists from any of the metros).
195,Huge mall,Amazing mall.I have been there like going home.You can find anything you want over thereBest place.
196,Huge mall .. very clean and all brands under one roof,We had gone to lulumall after visiting wonderla its  nice experience and we have purchased from the supermarket from the downstairs and had food from the food court thats in the upstairs it was a good experience one special thing i want to tell about the staff in the food court they are very good because we are eating food at late night and the announcment has been going on the mall is closed and the staff is waiting to clean the table but they dont tell make it fast or something like that  thats a good experience i got from there and we visit the mall once in a every month because the kilometre from mall to home is 300km up and down.
197,Great Experience ,"Ok, it's the biggest mall in SE Asia, so they say. Be e n to plenty in Bangkok that seem big too.  We were struck by how clean and well maintained it was.  Everything was spotless.  If you want sanitised shopping go for it!"
198,Family trip,"Went there with our toddler. Place is extremely family-friendly, pram are available for rent and there are play areas for small kids and an entertainment centre for children of all ages. As for shopping, Lulu supermarket offers a broad range of products needed for everyday use. A must visit place if you are in Cochin."
199,everything under one roof,"One stop mall for food, clothes and movies. Well laid out, clean, friendly shop assistants and mall staff. Well worth a visit when in Kochi."
200,SUPERB MALL,Complete shopping experience with almost all good brand outlets.Certainly quite impressive in size.definitely not the biggest in India as many claim and certainly not the best.food court left a lot to be desired.toy train is an attraction for children.100% must visit
201,Just another mall,"We were visiting Kochin for quite a while so how could we miss Lulu Mall, the largest mall in India?!? It’s not the place to go for souvenirs, but you get a slice of (wealthy) life in Kochi. There are many stores selling traditional clothing plus pretty much anything else you…"
202,Best mall in kochi ,Food quality was not so good as Dubai Not much of a choice here for decent Pakistan food. But try them good quality fresh cooked food try their veg
203,Lots of Good Restaurants ,"Lulu Mall at Kochi is supposed to be the biggest mall in India but I didn't find it that big. But the Lulu hypermarket is quite big with jaw dropping variety of everything from household items to jams, pickles, bakery, fastfood and what not. Lulu celebrates is also big with lot…"
204,"Excellent Mall, shoppers paradise","Neat and clean place, day by day they are improving their cleanliness, every one is working hard for the upkeep of the property, big congrats for the person who is incharge of those..."
205,Traffic is CRAZY... BOTH inside & outside.,"What else I should say . This is my weekend home.* many shopping brands*PVR cinemas * food court with all cuisines * Hypeemarket with everything * ice skating * ""sparkes"" the amusement park* ""lulu connect"" the tech hubThey're is nothing lulu has ."
206,Good but over hyped,Lots of games @ kid zone  Lots shopping for kids and us  Lots of food courts .  We enjoy Enjoy 2 days.  One come from metro way. 
207,Lots of options but particularly chaotic ,"Shops are plenty and all the varieties are available at all ranges, which is the speciality. This is what the people of Kerala likes. The luxury level is high than normal and it is clean."
208,Average,"Everything under the roof The biggest Mall of Asia. From food to fashion, whatever brand you desire is available"
209,Lulu Mall - A wonderful place to visit,Dont waste time visiting branded outlets. Just visit Hyper market first you can buy date from many countries at a very low price and also dry fruits.you can buy all type of fruits from the world.Buy Chicken broast kerala green pepper.  Then visit lulu fashio store then childrens…
210,Excellent spot,"Many many, excellent showrooms and practically all the brands are available. Its a great place to shop, eat or just spend leisure time!"
211,One of the best malls i ever visited!!,A brilliant place to visit in Cochin. The fruit section is mind boggling with the variety of fruits from every corner of the world.  If you are designer fan you name it and it is in Lulu mall. Living in the west this mall is  better than best I have visited in the west.  Variety…
212,A mall for all your needs.,Excellent upmarket restaurant with delicious tasty food.Their prawn biryani is one of the best I have tasted in a long time.But they also have other succulent dishes which I am planning to try next time.Very good service and very nice cosy atmosphere I strongly recommend it.
213,Largest mall in India,"Lulu Malls are very popular in the Middle East and now aims at expanding their operations in Southern India. Lulu Mall at Ernakulam, Kochi is a huge one with 3 floors & has a few resturants as well like Paragon famous for Sea food. The mall has the usual Indian & International brands like shoes,watches, clothes/traditional Indian wear, cosmetics,electrical appliances etc. Certain brands are Bata,Hush Puppies, Aldo Footwear,and many more. Overall the brand's ofcourse are a slightly boring nd the collection offered is as neither trendy. A MAC cosmetics store is coming up & many more like Inc 5,Mochi or stylish brands are a must other wise it's an usual mall. A)A shop named Super 99 is very good and price friendly. I bought a few home items & some antique items as well & the staff is also very friendly & helpful. B) Another store worth visiting is Lulu Celebrates- it's a saree shop spread over 2 floors. The 1st floor has cheap cotton cum semi siks sarees & the second floor has all Kanchipuram and pure silk sarees & the traditional kerala sarees as well. The collection is very good and a lot of variety and one can choose from a lot of different price range. The staff ofcourse speaks only Malayalam & little English but overall they need do require some formal English training when dealing with non- kochiites. We had to tell them through actions ""to open the saree"" or any new patterns?etc...But overall ladies will love it !!C) Another worth visiting store is the Lulu Hypermarket which is enormous & lovely & one asks the question what is not here? It has everything....A Butchery kept extremely clean...beef,mutton, chicken,fish if all kinds,packed-unpacked are available.A Roastery as well includes all the spices and condiments of Kerala are available. A travellers tip- Do buy the unpacked spices/condiments from here and the packing is done infront of you & very hygienic & pocket friendly...eg: coriander powder,fish/chicken/mutton masala & Biryani masala, garam masala, spiced kajus, pepper,dalchini & even Kokam(a spice put in food and speciality of Kokan, Maharashtra) there are also packed spices/condiments as well but not recommended..Other part of the hypermarket also has cooking appliances,stationery, bakery products & bakery items,usual groceries and many other things which a normal store has but the varieties are fabulous. The staff is extremely helpful & there are 27 payment counters for hassle-free payments.Overall the Lulu Mall is worth a visit & they should add more brands as well to make it more catchy but definitely spare some days off for visiting since ina day or so one can't visit it.Thanks"
214,it just beyond my expectation,The mall is BIG by our standards. The food court was nice. Kids loved the game zone. Though walking become a bit of a problem with my toddlers. It was an excellent place to kill time.
215,Excellent,"during our recent trip to Kerala we visited this famous mall, known to be the largest mall in India!it's spread in around 6 hector area and has nearly 220 brand outlets.!it's having a superb hypermarket and a multi screen theatre .Kochi metro has direct passage from the mall!you can see outlets of almost all brands .hypermarket has many unique items with reasonable rate.our most favourite place in the mall was food court!!it has many food outlets and also has a children's games zone.overall a must visit place in Kochi."
216,Most popular Mall in Kochi,"If you wanna have a best shopping experience while you're in Kochi just visit Lulu Mall. A best place to take your family and friends. Shopping, Movies, food... a lot of international brands and products. Edappally metro station and Edappally Chucrch are closer to Lulu."
217,Large upscale mall,"From our Ibis Hotel, we took the MG station metro (30 Inr each) for 6 stops to the Edappally Station. Easy walk to the Sky-walk to access the 3rd floor of this huge mall, entering at the Taco Bell. We strolled all levels including the top amusement park with the small ice rink before ending up at the world class Hypermarket on the ground floor. Its the best we have seen in India with a wide selection of fruit/veggies and lots of foreign grocery.Enjoying this ultra modern mall, followed by the high city views from the quiet metro, our entire morning was a complete contrast to our normal hectic, hot, chaotic and noisy touring in India."
218,Keep good every time,enjoy the shopping in a modern atmosphere you will feel you are in Dubai . have fun but don't go weekend night.
219,Amazing,"good place to spend time and money.the ""hypermarket""has Good slections and more over good and reliable products."
220,HiLITE Mall Calicut is one of the Biggest Mall in Kerala.,"All brands you will find here . Hugely spread . Well maintained. Could find few brands which were not available any where, lots of varieties. I enjoyed the gaming zone. Food court seems to have less option for veg and outlets are also not mcu has compared to mall"
221,Lulu,"At Lulu Mall, what makes shopping a great experience is that there are all the great brands but also because you get almost everything here, and you don't have to run to another place to find it. And everything is showcased pretty well, living up to the high standards of its name."
222,Best mall I ever been too ,"Recenty visited the much famous Lulu mall. Was surprised that the hype, dare I say, is a bit over the top. A very good set of shops, but for a truly successful mall, the area around needs to have a tourist kind of feel with other attractions such as Dubai fountain and Burj for…"
223,Amazing mall with so much to do!,Very good place to spend weekends with kids enjoying their games and having variety of food. Paragon hotel is out of the world with some authentic malabari cousine
224,Lulu; Shopping and Leisure at it's best,Is this a mall?? I think it’s a city market within itself.. you name anything and you can easily get it there itself.. any brand any thing.. Simply superb.. I think you will need at least a week if you want to visit every place within the mall.
225,One days not enough ,"Though it is one of the biggest malls in the country , and houses all local and international big brands, the food court and the wash room hygiene levels on a busy day sadly reminds us that we are stil much behind. People just do not have the civic sense to leave a place cleaner than they found it ! An average experience."
226,Great place,"You can find everything you need ther. Local shops and shops from all over the world, food and things to do with kids"
227,Very bad experience,"I visit with my family , I spend one of the wonderful day. you can buy anything under one roof.best mall I ever visited in india"
228,"Great experience, Everything under one roof!",A great place for all activities and shopping. Sparkys my kid en joyed  a ice skating. We got all our daily needs in hypermarket.  
229,Fantastic mall ,Its a great experience.It is an ideal place to spend time with friends.crowded place....Branded shoes are also there.So we can also make required shopping.
230,Excellent ,"Oh! there are so many branded shops,a huge supermarket in size which i have seen anywhere in India and you get lot of varieties and whatever you need is there . The mall is stupendous and they say its one of the biggest in Asia . Astonishing!!"
231,Great for shopping,"When you are bored and want to go out for a break Lulu mall Kochi is a good idea. You have to Wade through the crowd though. Getting into parking itself would be difficult over the weekend. Best option take an Uber. Once you are in, you have lots of shopping options."
232,Huge!,Seems like a galleria you would find in America. Very upscale.  Mostly expensive things but amazing place just to walk around. Can be very crowded so I would go early. But great walking and sights. A must see in Cochin. This place is huge
233,One stop for everything,There's a wide range of shops topped off by an awesome hypermart.  It gets very crowded in the weekends.
234,Lulu mall,There is a discrimination that males are not allowed with kids into the premises is a very bad rule..kids with no mother and only father are not allowed to play here..Discrimination against kids with single parent.i recommend the management to take this seriously and remove this…
235,My fav mall ,"Well this is one of bad experiences I had ever with some of my friends from UK in Lulu Celebrations clothing section with Where almost all staff don’t even speak a single word of English plus the manager was rude, the staff try to follow us all throughout the has as they were thinking that we might steal something from there. It was a rude behaviour from the staff except from lady staff. This is not acceptable at all. Worst experience ever had. Won’t recommend to go there if you don’t to speak Malayalam."
236,Elegant mall,"A decent mall... full of western shops which was a bit of a disappointment tbh as we wanted to purchase some Indian fashion... it’s clean, well laid.... security is tight..."
237,Everything available,You will get the pleasant moments to pass here with your family. A big market for every thing to shopping. Your children will also get their joyful moments here.
238,Shoppers' Paradise!,Nice place. Good eating joints. Was not crowded as it was a weekday. Spent a couple of hours there. Wide variety of stores
239,Not for bargain hunters,"If you are one of those “Shop until I Drop,” places, stop into LU LU’s Mall! It’s huge and it’s got everything and it’s fun just to walk around and see the local people in mobs just out for a great time! So you don’t need a shopping agenda to go there! JUST GO THERE! "
240,"A mall comparable to any in the world , better than most!!",after some weeks in Asia maybe you will long for some western style good idea to buy dresses here as you will find good quality items
241,"Very big, but can be improved",A sprawling place with so many stores. It was just before Christmas so there was a festive air and throngs of people all over the mall.  The visitors included the rich and not so rich because it was a major festival in Kochi.

243,One stop shopping,"From NZ and Australia, frankly could've been any mall in the world.  Clean, nice but same same and soulless.  Everything same prices as home so not worth buying and carrying back.  Not a lot of different or interesting shops. "
244,Best place to shop,"Good place whenever you go. Time flies once you are in Lulu. At last you end up rushing and waiting restlessly in queue for payment. Good place for shopping, dining or entertainment. Lavish parking space. You can get whatever you get in Lulu Middle East over here too. Lots of offers. Love this place."
245,World class shopping experience in Kochi,Really good place to hangout and spend time. Really good for kids and family. Though its a bit expensive 
246,Paragon,"Has the largest hypermarket in the vicinity and you can practically find everything you need there. I spent almost a week looking for a can opener in small household selling shop and other malls and ended up finding that prized possession in the lulu hypermarket and was ecstatic. If you're looking to buy souvenirs, they have some shops like Spices India there as well. From branded clothes to gold/jewellery shops, to food places (both local and franchises), they have an impressive amount of things to do there. One of my favourites was going to floor 4 to Sparky's to ride the rides for like 10 rupees per person! (my personal fav ride was Jamaica)!"
247,Big and Entertaining,"I had been to this place a couple of times .Now it is way too overcrowded ,with lot of people .Literally it is like a tourist place where people come to visit .If you want to shop in hyper market, go early morning as traffic is less and there are no big lines .Otherwise esp weekends are nightmare .Also they overcharge for parking"
248,Massive mall-direct entry from metro,"The movie entertainment facility by PVR cinemas is excellent with the state-of-the-art sound, vision and seating comforts. The wash and rest rooms also of high standards and well maintained. Limited eatables and drinks provided inside PVR multiplex which are very costly. Inward access to PVR is very convenient  but exit especially after late night movies are confusing and inadequate."
249,Not our thing,"LuLu Mall in Edapally, Kochi is a massive international mall! We really enjoyed the experience of shopping here, as it has something for every budget and for the needs of families! The mall is a mixture of great high end stores and affordable stores. The food too is available in a massive food court. I highly recommend it - easy to get through to the metro as well."
250,Nice mall with lots of stuff,One of the best mall till now I've visited... You think of anything and you get it ...Hypermarket itself is enough for everything thing u want..
251,A landmark in Kochi,Stayed in this beautiful property which is neither on the beach nor near the backwaters.  Amazing experience .  The cassava restaurant had some amazing food and I could not help but try it both the days. A very friendly lot greets you and makes a connect especially the Director…
252,Good shopping,My visit this time and always when I come for a vacation to my home town I frequently visit this Mall my favorites
253,A well maintained Mall - a gift to all Cochin residents.,Highly recommended this hotel My second visit in this hotel Breakfast tasty and healthy Restaurant not inside this hotel but service is available Staff very helpful and welcoming with smile
254,Spend an entire day by mall hopping!!!,"LuLu Mall - Edapally, Kochi, Kerala, IndiaThis is one of the largest Malls in India in terms of floor space with around 200+ shops and food outlets. It is the first mall in India of the Gulf based LuLu Group. It has interest areas for every age group. For children it has a vast Games Area with lots of rides and other games along with an Ice Skating Rink. For Foodies, apart from a host of traditional restaurants, there is a large food court with food from all parts of India including the burgers and pizzas loved by the young. For the digitally inclined youngsters there is, apart from the regular Samsung and Oppo retailers, the large LuLu Connect Electronics showroom. For the fashion conscious, apart from the international brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Vero Moda, etc., there is the LuLu Celebrate with good ethinic wear. For those looking for jewelry most of the large jewelers have their store here including the international watch brands like Rado and Tissot. The biggest attraction is however the Lulu Hypermarket, the one stop shop for everything from luggage, cutlery & cookware, groceries, fish & meat, fruits & vegetables, exotic dry fruits from across the globe and a ready to eat food counter for those who do not want to go home and cook after a tiring visit to the mall. For those who want to see the latest movies, the Mall has 9 Screens in the PVR Multiplex. All in all it is one point entertainment point for the family. Reaching the Mall is fairly easy. Its on the main Ernakulam-Aluva Road at Edpally, the intersection of two main National Highways. There are bus stops very close to it but the best way to go there is to take the Kochi Metro and get down at the Edapally Station and take the tunnel that directly connects the station to the Mall."
255,Lulu is huge. ,"wow , this place is hugeee...is much bigger then any american mall i been too, alot of high end stores, the hyper mart is so full of people i barely could walk thru it..i love the atmosphere and ambiance, really great mall and movie place for family or wife...sooo many stores , the highlight to our cochin tour"
256,Easily Accessible,Wanted to take a look at this biggest mall in Asia during my trip to Kochi for a business trip. Truly a biggest mall.
257,Best mall in the region ! ,It’s one of the best places to go for shopping. It has all the things ranging from household items to local authentic items . Has ample of parking spaces .
258,the urban kochi thrives,I visited the shopping center in 2008 with our daughter and grand children. Very well designed to meet the needs of fall age groups. Very good parking areas and directional signs. Has good food stalls and restaurants. Good access through the metro rail. The sponsor has very good vision and India needs such good shopping centers in other parts of India. The Indians will not have to got abroad for such shopping experience.
259,Biggest Mall - Asia,waited last to come here and realised how much time and money were wasted shopping elsewhere in kerala.  lots of choices for souvenirs and other locally made products to bring home.
260,Great Experience ,"LuLu Mall is located in Edapally,Kochi. It is one of the largest mall in Kerala.Lulu Mall has many outlets including food court,restaurant, PVR cinemas,etc"
261,WOW! Big mall and beautiful. ,"You are bored of wandering in the streets of Kochi - here is the best place for your to spend your time with family & friends.  Do shopping, have fun for children, watch movies, dine.. what else you need, everything available under one roof."
262,Nice mall,The mall is a really good place to spend a few hours away from the sun- good for retail therapy.Place is clean including the toilets. The hypermart is huge with lots of variety.
263,Jayne Gill,"It was a good experience there at lulu mallWere our gang could access anything we needed like food with superb restaurants ,good food ,amusement park, movie theater, hardware shops, mobile stores, home appliances store, branded cloth showrooms and a lot moreEveryone must try it"
264,Huge standard shopping mall,"What a great place to visit when you want to escape the heat of the City.  If it is busy it is hardly noticeable as the place is so vast.    There are a good mixture of shops and a massive hypermarket which is well stocked and serves some lovely cooked food items.  The container of Biryani is so enormous it has to be seen to be believed.    The freshly prepared salad items are recommended.     There are also some great eating places.To avoid the heavy traffic and heat, we took the Metro and got down at Edapally,   where there is a skywalk leading directly into the Mall.  Wonderful."
265,the best mall in cochin,"Went in there since it was right next to the Marriott where I stayed. There were quite a few restaurants there. One highly recommended place is Anjappar Chettinad, clean, inexpensive, and excellent food, with about 30 locations around the world. There were other places as well including a grill place but that was quite a bit more expensive and not as good."
266,Nice place,"From food to clothing to electronics to entertainment, this is the all in one place in town. Now with the metro access, you can actually skip the traffic and move ahead."
267,Great shopping experience,"As much as I love the noise and street life of India it was a joy to enter the air-conditioned western-style mall like the ones I love at home. Good coffee at Cafe Coffee Day; great bargains at several of the large department stores and supermarket; amazing entertainment and excellent staff always willing to help and point you in the right direction. By the way there is also a place to get a massage, gadget store and much, much more."
268,Good place for shopping and hangout.,"This place is good to spend time and money. If you're taking children to this mall, remember to carry drinking water or buy from the Food Court in 3rd floor."
269,Nice and all comprehensive mall for everything you want to buy,"We spent a day here whilst waiting for our night train at 11:30pm.There are so many retail stores, everything you would need here and beautifully laid out! Includes fantastic cinema with English films also!Food choices are huge and really tasty! Even has a Costa!Recommend a visit if in Cochin."
270,Best shopping place india,"For work, we usually stay right next door at the Marriott. It is convenient to just walk over to one of the biggest malls in Asia. They have every brand with local India brands as well. Also there are good restaurants. This is a great place for souvenir shopping, clothes…"
271,"Very Nice, looks like Dubai Mall",Well stocked and having lots of varities of things. Fruits from many places. Fish from all over the world. Well maintained.
272,Sightseeing or Shopping?,All Branded Shops available plus a multiplex if you like to go for a movie.And a very big food court.Parking is not free you need to pay for it
273,World Class,Hypermarket is awesome ...Probably has the largest choice of fish & meat one can imagine. Even the icecream section consists of two full aisles!! The mall also has some the most premium clothing and jewelry brands of India.
274,"Huge, never ending Mall",Never buy hummus from rack they keep the previous day's hummus packed up and exhibited in the set area you can feel a fouls smells and taste as soon as you reach your home always take from the freshly made spread a area ( I have informed the same to the chef on duty and the other staff present during the time.they remove as soon as I tell them but the same thing happens again)
275,The largest shopping mall in India,"Impressive size, stores and cleanliness will make you remember your trip to the UAE or any other middle eastern country. Some of the stores have better quality products than found in the ME. Food court was larger than most of the indian malls we'd seen so far with a decent collection of food outlets. Security is also good. They will look at you like you owe them money. Very good accessibility by roads as it is single-handedly the major landmark for miles around.The major downside - crowd. Yes the crowd noticed here is probably more than at their railway stations. Also most of these are loafers of both (and all) genders who do nothing but give the cleaners a tough time cleaning the mall and people looking for space to sit at the food court. This very crowd seems to make some shopkeepers rude though we found most of the shop staff very friendly, polite and knowledgeable.Would definitely recommend to any tourist visiting this indian city."
276,Oversized mall,Shopping is a delightful experience You can get almost everything you want here.....I did and was very happy I have been here several times now and always come away pleased
277,Super mall,"Great for retail therapy. A good selection of shops including a grocery superstore and department store both owned by Lulu. We where told largest mall in India it didn’t seem that big. Easy to get to from Fort Kochi take ferry (the one by seagull hotel) 6 rupees each way walk to metro station 15mins walk,take metro to Edapally stop, 30 rupees then walk straight in to mall."
278,Bad experience of Lulu celebrations hall,"While you are in kerala ,dont worry about your shopping needs.just head on to kerala's biggest and best mall in Cochin,This mall is location in the heart of the city,it is connected to cochin metro and easily accessable from anywhere in kerala.It can meet all your expectations.2…"
279,Food and film,Very bad experience at lulu connect.i spent a lot of my salary there.better to buy from more trustworthy people for electronics.
280,Huge mall,Wonderful i hope to repit this visit again me and my husband enjoyed too muchI love this country so much
281,Punjab Grill at Lulu Mall,"Lulu Mall is not only for shopping but for a whole new experience in discovering things that you've never seen before (like exotic fruits and vegetables), for spending time at a game zone with an indoor ice-skating rink and for experiencing  some great cuisines of all varieties. And just in case you feel like watching a movie to relax for a couple of hours during or after your shopping, there's an excellent multiplex inside. Overall, you'll undoubtedly have a great experience that you won't forget for quite a while. Time just flies once you're inside the Mall and before you realise it, it's time for you to leave for your home or for your hotel room."
282,Best in kerala ,Have all items from groceries to gold in competitive prices. Check out their offers and promotions in prior to select the items. Car parking fee can be waived off upon lulu bills. Neatly maintained with huge staff support will make you feel great experience.
283,experience is what  lulu stands for,I enjoyed coming here with friends. Nice shops to look in and cheap food from the restaurants or the food court. Just avoid McDonald’s whatever you do!
284,One of India's Largest Malls in the scenic Kochi city in Kerala,"Went to this mall...felt like you are in a gulf country....well maintained and clean, very nice mall.....went to do some shopping in the Lulu market...its a busy place....had Mcdonalds  did'nt roam inside the mall a lot....as it was crazy busy inside....walked down to the Edapally Church....10-15 minutes walk..."
285,Best mall in KERALA,"Literally.... everything is here,from grains to goldFrom mobile to its cover, from cloths to Food & from movie to all type of things...it is a Hypermall"
286,One stop shop for all your needs.. ,"Given its size and newness, you would expect a lot more than this basic mall. We went looking to buy things - western clothes,gifts, souvenirs - and left empty handed and underwhelmed after just a couple of hours."
287,Very good,"I spent my time sipping coffee and working at lulu mall all day long, I spent time with family or friends at lulu on weekends. It doesn’t matter what, lulu mall is the only option."
288,A please of leisure more than a Mall,"Any time ,Any day.... if you go this mall ,it's too crowded ...just like a festival ground .... Too Noisy .... Plus I dont whether it's because of room temperature maintence (extra cold comparing normal local temperature  ) or whether it's because of exhaust system they using , whenver I go there.... I gets headache & feels like some issue with the air quality inside the mall ....Despite the ambience & if you want to save your time , it's a place where you can do everything under one umberalla .... But not my choice ....Being the biggest mall of the city, worth visiting .... But if you comming from some city of malls, I recommend not to waste your time in malls...Explore local places & support local vendors ...."
289,Amazing,Absolutely worth a visit if you are a shopping buff.It brings all the worlds leading brands under one umbrella and even local brands like John's and MTR. While it maybe a bit expensive for the locals they can still get their money's worth in one of the best super markets-Lulu…
290,Good place to visit,appreciate that the standards are maintained without compromise in keeping up the mall in order. I love the way the screens are maintained. a good place to spend time and worth time spending and shopping.
291,Big modern mall,Thanks to management to providing such a wonderful experiences for my family. Special thanks for prayer room what they offered for the customer like us.
292,Biggest mall of india,"Had to get here while in Kochi, and in fact, I went twice in the month.  I was told it's very crazy busy in the evening hours and on weekends, and that is the truth!  I arrived at the mall at about noon on Saturday and the drive drop off wasn't too busy at noon.  But by 4pm when…"
293,Super nice mall,"Good overall, but grossly over hyped. It's ok for people who gave never been to a shopping mall before, but for all others, it's just another shopping mall and nothing more."
294,"""""Vacation Trip""""","My brother and family were visiting us this diwali . It was my brother,s son in law's first visit to India and wanted to taste typical kerala food . He loved the appams , Malabar biriyani and fish mango curry .shopping experience at Lulu mall is really good . Hypercity is super…"
295,A Nice place to shop in Cochin,I went with my family where my son enjoys the Sparky's and it's a best place to spend time for shopping and dining.
296,Amazing place for day outing,"This is the best mall ever I've been to, I would definitely recommend you to visit this epic and great mall in kochi, Kerala, This mall is one of the renowned and biggest mall in india. You'll love this mall's wide variety of brands ."
297,Lulu Mall,"I have been there only once, yet a few things which I liked the most about the mall are :1. Cleanliness2. Lots of shopping, food and play options.3. Metro connectivity."
298,Feels like Dubai,I used to live close to lulu..so I cant remember how much time I ve spent there. Pls remember it's a nightmare to enter on weekends.(its as if whole of kerala is inside) Otherwsie very good hangout spot for groups
299,Great mall in great location,"If you're looking to get a good deal on quality Indian clothing as we were, don't bother: men's shirts for example were Rs1400-3500. By European standards, this is simply a typical large shopping mall with mostly international stores and food chains. Definitely not worth the 1.5 hour round trip from Fort cochin."
