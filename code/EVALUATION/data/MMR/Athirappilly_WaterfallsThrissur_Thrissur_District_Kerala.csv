Just stay by the water fall and enjoy the scenic view and beauty of the fall ! it takes about an hour and half to reach from Kochi Airport. If you are adventurous best time to visit is during monsoon, or just after the that. If you are on liesure trip with family, November to January is the best time of the year for the visit !!"
16,Athirappily Waterfalls ,"Well I had an amazing time....the experience of looking at the water roaring down with such force is indeed exhilarating. Athirapallly is the largest waterfall in Kerala, which stands tall at 80 feet. I visited this place mid July, due to heavy rains we were not allowed to go down but to stand above.... the waters kept roaring like a monster ☺. The best part is this place is plastic free!!

58,The biggest and best waterfall in God's Own Country !,This place is always special to visit as we can enjoy the fresh water bathing. Visit early hours to escape from the hot sun. The heat waves from the rocks are too much.
59,Place of Joy,We were here last month to take a sneak peek at the famous waterfall scene from bahubali and it did not disappoint. It takes a bit of hike to visit this place. Make sure to carry a waterbottle as the hike can make you tired and thirsty.
60,Disappointed and worst tourist location in Kerala,A mesmerizing feel of mother nature. The nature's way of keeping the earth cool. You will never forget this feel if you visit once to this beautiful place. The roads are amazing kept well and you'll love the nature on the way. There is a pine forest on top of the falls where you can sit and enjoy the beautiful view of the water falls.

The place is a small heaven for nature lovers, bird watchers and adventure seekers.We got a chance to do trekking, hiking, mountain climbing, surfing, and camping. The place is home to a number of migratory birds which makes the place a literal heaven for bird watchers. A stay near the falls gives a marvellous moment in my life. We got beautiful memories and I would like to recommend you to take Gogeo Holidays which gives tranquil experience in your life."
69,One of the best spot tourist spot in Kerala,"If one is fascinated with Niagara falls, but Athirapally, during monsoon is no less than a Niagara! But beware that to experience the real feel, one needs to climb down a steep one kilometer path which takes you to the bed of the falls. It was a thrilling experience - to see the huge splash of water and the sprinkles of droplets raising as clouds all over. There are three rainbows formed just before us and it was mesmerizing. Beware of parking - during season, there would be so many vehicles and it would be diffuclt to park."
70,Niagara of South India,"No words to express the beauty. We went 1 year before when it was flowing with full flow. This is know us the Niagara of Kerala.  Its very beautiful to see in rainy season.  You can have a bath in river on top of waterfall.  There are other two waterfalls, charpa and vazachal…"

76,Finest waterfalls in Kerala,"Before this trip, i have never been to the athirapilly waterfalls, just saw in pictures and heard lot about it. We went as a trip from our office. The journey from Chalakudy to the Athirappilly Falls passes through a landscape of winding roads, small villages and lush green…"

80,The Beauty Queen of Kerala,Visited this place recently. Travelled via Valparai. The drive was as usual thrilling and long. But could not make it before 5.00 pm to the falls. Reached at 5.15 pm. The ticket office 200 m away from the entrance to the falls was closed and any amount of pleading did not heed…
81,Watet works,"The place is awesome. Not allowed to go near falls but you can play in backwater. Its a nice experience. Visited in april, it was too humid. Yet good experience."
82,Exhilarating experience!!,Amazing natural water fall .We enjoyed a lot. Should be very carefull if children are with u because the way to water fall is little slippery. Also obey the instructions of forest guards and life guards.
83,Best of monsoon,This waterfall was a really nice place to visit. Even though you need to trek down a little bit through the reserve forest and the way down to the waterfall is pretty hard to go it was a nice place worth seeing. Those who would like to see the natural waterfall would love this and the sound of waterfall.
84,Athirappilly review,"The pounding power of water can be experienced here, a short day trip from Thrissur city. Along with Chappa Falls, a little further away, Athirappily waterfalls ensure that water power stays in memory, indelibly."

87,Waterfalls,The road is awesome...perfect for bike riding experience...the waterfall area is also neat and well maintained..
88,Refreshing Monsoon ,"Waterfalls are always a pleasure, its all the more fun if you can go under it and get wet all over and make some amazing memories! the force of the waterfall is not too much which makes this possible"
89,Athirapalli water falls,The water fall is just breath taking.  You will have to hike down to see the water fall from bottom.  There are no steps it's little bit slippery. It's advisable to take spare clothes or raincoat as one will get wet from most due to the falling water. 
90,Simply Outstanding creation of Nature,"Visited early morning and walked not only at the top but also down to the bottom of the falls. Very popular place with newly weds as they have their photos taken with the falls as a backdrop. Cost to enter was 100 rupees for foreigners and 30 rupees for locals. If you struggle to get up or down paths then I’d suggest not going down to the bottom of the falls. Although there are seats to rest along the way, in heat, with steep slopes and not a particularly good path, you will struggle. That said it’s worth the trip. Downside - the locals appear not to appreciate the area, as it is strewn with old clothes as they swim in the water and used nappies which brings the area down - shame as it is a beautiful natural tourist attraction."
91,Athirampilly Waterfalls,Visited the falls with my baby and she liked der very much. Please note there are many monkeys so keep the food and juices very safe. After January the water was on shallow level so V could enjoy well without much crowd. The drive was awesome.
92,Niagara Falls of South India,Such a beautiful location.  Truly it is said that this waterfall is known as India's Nigara Falls.  One can see this waterfall from upper as well as from lower level.  It's nice & adventurous experience to walk down through sleepery hills and watch the water falls from height. …

96,Amazing Venue,"Not only is the waterfall beautiful, but the valley in which it is falling is amazing. The view of the valley can be seen from the top of the waterfall, while the best view of the waterfall can be seen from near its bottom. We went there in monsoons and that could be the reason…"

98,Raw and Mighty,"We visited the waterfalls and although lovely the water level was quite low, needs to be seen after the rains have come."
99,One Of The Awesome Water Falls In Kerala,"A place where u should definitely go in south India, guys believe me it's an awesome place, u could go solo or with friends or as couples, u would definitely enjoy it "
100,Beautiful waterfalls,"Well this is one the spot you shouldn't miss while in keral. It's almost 70 km from main Kochi and takes almost two hours to reach from Kochi.I along with my friends travelled in big traveller. Well I 'll advise to take a private cab. I am not sure about the public transport.When you reach there, beware of the monkey's all around. They won't hesitate to jump on anything that you have which they feed upon. It advisable not to give any attention to them. Just keep walking with your belonging intact. While you take a walk for a while, you will find that there are two paths for the hi fall and each path leads to different side of the fall. Easy path is  simple one and will lead straight to the fall. You can see the catchment. You can the see the water falling from you level of your feet. You will observe the stream from the fall, making its way through the jungle and green jungle mountains and sky in the horizon. If the sky is cloudy, it would be mesmerising. I had one same view. In the catchment at back, you can find people bathing in fresh water. Well don't hesitate to join them. But beware of the flow of water and don't go in deep. While my friends had been in bathing, I rather chose to sit around, clicking pictures for them. Other way leads is kinda trail that will lead you to the foot of fall. Once you reach the foot of falls , just climb on the small rocks towards the fall(be very careful), and just feel the tiny droplets of water splashing against you. Trust me. Forget about your camera pictures and phone. Just forget for a while and sit and enjoy the fall. Well , the feeling when the splashed water droplets falls on you, is something I still carry with me today. And without that feeling , this trip would be vain. Ps: the trail is bit tiring especially when it comes to trekking back to upside but it's not something impossible. One must just do  it. And be cautious.All the best guys. Enjoy."
101,wonderful place,This waterfall has featured in one too many movies. There are 2 views of the waterfall. One from the top where you all also get to dip yourself in the lake. You can also view the fall from the bottom and see the waterfall crashing down and rising again as mist. There is a small…

103,Just too beautiful,"The trail towards the falls is awesome..one can easily reach the upper view point..from where you van see the free fall of the Chalakudy River,but the main attraction is a stone paved trail towards the foothill of the falls, a but tiring, but when you reach the foothill of the falls and the water-mists make you wet , you can feel something special about it. ,"
104,Beauty of nature,One of the best waterfall to visit. Nothing best to visit this heaven during monsoon as i went in aug2017. Went by private car. Have to trekk down in narrow lane with monkeys roaming. And finally the waterfall at such a small distance. Soak urself with the water splashing from…
105,Awesome shooting location,One of the best waterfalls in kerala. I visited so many times. Last one was on March 2019. Best place for family get together and family trips.
106,Beautiful ,The waterful looks so beautiful but would be even better if you visited in rainy season when the fall is in its full glory.. do not expect the view from top so close coz that was a restricted place and i guess it depends upon season. The trek down for the full view  of the falls…

109,Good place - overcrowded,I visited the falls in January . They are about 70km from Kochi and would take around 2 hours to reach. We went to see the bottom view. The walk is very steep and my parents managed to walk but still faced a few problems. If you can walk about 2km the walk is worth it . The falls are amazing. It's a must see.
110,Great experience ,"After having seen many waterfalls all over the world, this pales into insignificance.  However, this is place is good and well developed by the Forest department ( it is plastic free).  If you carry a plastic water bottle, they put a sticker on it and ask you to deposit Rs.10. …"
111,Most beautiful waterfalls in India,Not worth taking the trip as the place is poorly maintained & the paths are slippery. Not for older folks & children. No warning signages to warn of steep inclines & descents. It's a shame to Kerala tourism. 
112,Great must see place,Nature's bounty is at its best at Athirapilly. But the visit to the waterfalls will have to be timed towards monsoon season in Kerala to enjoy the 80 ft high and 330 ft wide frothy waterfall!  My visit in May (summer) was quite untimely as the waterfall was very narrow and the…

124,Solo biking ,"We visited this place at the end of January 2020. Even at this time of the year, the waterfalls looked lively and beautiful to watch."
125,Strike prevented us from enjoying Falls up close ,"We went in July and the waterfall was full of water. Top view was majestic but the front view totally blew our mind. We just stood there silently admiring the beauty of the waterfall. Water droplets were coming after hitting the rocks as if it is raining.To reach the top view of the waterfall, you need to go down ~400 m and another ~200 m for the front view, but it was all worth it.

133,The free flowing falls from 80 feet height gonna make you feel crazy...,"I had been to this water falls on winter season. This water falls is really amazing. It is situated in a forest.

136,Refreshing Place,One of the best place in thrissur to spent the whole day with nature which makes our mind fresh for a day
137,With My family,"Didn't see this place at its most impressive because I went just before the monsoon, so water levels were very low.  At the top of the ""falls"", most of the rocks & channels were exposed. The cararact was just a small stream falling over the edge into the valley below. You can…"
138,Worth all the Hype - truly India's Nigara,Very nice place any time here water and ravan Bahubali lot of filim shooting place trucking photo shoot everything is good here
139,Awesome Nature,The most famous waterfalls of Kerala and is having a gr8 flora n fauna.jst make sure u get the tickets first to enter inside as der is entry ticket..n d worst part is dat we hv to travel  1 km back to get d entry ticket from d entry gate..for d main waterfall view we hv to go down abt 1 to 1.5 km through d offroad wch is quite tiring.we aware of monkey they snatch away eatables.but keeping aside everthing its a gr8 place wth emence beauty.
140,Truly - India's Nigara Falls,"The Athirapally fallshave a splendid atmosphere. It's not only the falls that are majestic, but also the entire area around it. You get beautiful views from almost every spot near the waterfalls. Unlike the other waterfalls in Kerala, the Athirapally falls never dry out."
141,Heavenly,"A very scenic place, with water falling from huge heights. The breeze of the water drops that rise after hitting the ground is an awesome feel to cherish. The water levels have gone down recently but still you would cherish the place for sure. This is the very place where the…"
142,Bahubali Falls!,"Athirapally is often called the Niagara falls of India. We visited in January, following a failed monsoon, so the water was scarce, but it still looked impressive. I see why so many movies were shot there. You'll need to get tickets at the office about half a kilometer from the entrance. You'll need to walk up the hill for 5-10 minutes to see the falls and for about a kilometer down if you want to get to the foot of the falls. There is a snack bar up there, but beware of the monkeys. Also, check the coffee shop near the gates for a scenic view."
143,Niagra of kerala,We were during unexpected rainy time Full gushing flow Everything except to get a parking lot is a bit difficult Went down also where that spraying effect of water gun is there Must visit including charpa falls nd vazhachal falls
144,Spectacular and very scenic,Though we missed the fun to play beneath waterfall but still the view was impeccable. We will definitely plan our next visit in summers.
145,Beautiful and reachable,"Athirapally and Vazhachal, the two picturesque and majestic waterfalls; enjoy the charming weather and mind-blowing beauty of flora and fauna. The cool spray that covers a large area near the falls makes Athirapally a scenic location. The picturesque Vazhachal waterfall is close…"
146,Big and White,Tourism has picked up here which makes it a little crowded. Lots of vendors on the streets. Visit only as a checkpoint on your list
147,Nice place to relax,I always loved this place. Its a marvellous creation by God. Best time to visit is during the monsoon.
148,Nice place,"Great feeling when start seeing the falls,to have best view one has to walk a bit,but once you have clear & nice view you are mesmerized"
149,"Given by Nature, spoilt by Man !","This place, rich with its flaura n fauna has its wilderness preserved since ages. Attractive but dangerous water falls are mesmerising. Best visit is in monsoon. "
150,A must visit in Kerala,Good plasent place to visit.good waterfalls    lot of people are visiting this place with their family.
151,Athirapally Falls- Pride of India! (In Monsoon),"Nice, serene green area, beware of monkeys and long walk up and down the hills to reach the bottom of the falls"
152,Athirapally water: one of the best waterfall in have seen,It is a beautiful waterfall and the walk from Gate is nice. Be careful of the monkeys and dont carry any food or water including baby feeding bottles in your hand that might attract the monkeys attention. The drive to both athirapilly and vazhachal is a pleasant drive.
153,THE LOVELY NIAGRA OF KERALA,"Good experience visiting Athirapally waterfalls. This takes some effort to come from parking but is easily doable. As it is steep down, going back is rather difficult. All depends on the fitness.  Also, you can't enter the water, and probably that's the thing due to which it is…"
154,Amazing waterfall...,heavy water falls was on day which i visited. A must visit place for family to entertain their kids. Nice place to make some memorable selfies.
155,Athirappilly water falls,"Naturally Beautiful wild waterfall. Famous for the location of the blockbuster movie bahubali. Located in the midst of jungle but easily accessible by road. (Chalakkudi- valparai rout) entrance fee is INR 20 or 30 per person (can't remember correctly) The top of the waterfall is walkable distance from main road. But to reach the bottom of the waterfall is a bit risky way. The authorities placed the board ""the breath taking view of the waterfall will take your breath away"". So be careful and do not enter in to the water. The walkway to the bottom of waterfall is too steep and slippery, which is not appropriate for people with heart disease."
156,Must visit,"Beautiful waterfalls. Great scenary. Must visit place for those who love forests,waterfalls etc. Road transportation is much preferable. Can visit in any season but the beautiness in monsoon is really somewhat different. Must see tourist attractions in kerala."
157,WOW,"This is a beautiful area up in the mountains of Kerala.  There are beautiful waterfalls and mountain paths. A great area for walkers. Very unlike anywhere else in India we stayed in a lovely area with views to enjoy. The hotel was Riverdale Resort, Munnar."

161,Awesome,the one of the best waterfall in kerala .you must wisit there when you come to kerala. the near waterfall is vazhachaal ....enjoy the wild beuty.......
162,Travel ,"The view was nice but visiting in december is not a good idea. Since it’s dry season, the stream of the waterfall wasn’t big.Need to walk about 1km with rough steps and a lot of monkeys.End of the day, it is very tiring.Not a good idea to travel with kids."
163,Kerala's Niagara falls,This beautiful location for visit with family. Big waterfall running when we have visited. Good time to visit is just after rain or monsoon.
164,Charming Falls,"The gorgeous falls will mesmerize you, but be careful it is not very safe to venture into these areas. "
165,Nature at its best ,"Went for a day trip to Athirappilly.  it was a great experience.  The crowd was too much but somehow there is still space for picture taking.  They close early at around 430PM.  All in all, it was great."
166,Breathkaing !!!,"We went to these falls by 9am in mid may.  You should walk at about 1km from the entrance gate of the area to view water falls scene.   The road way was well built to walk easily.  At the end of this 1 km path way, you can view Water falls from the Upper view.  If you want to go…"
167,Power of water,"We went during off season, hence it had less water. We took a walk downhill to get a full view of the falls and it was very steep and long. It was truly worth the efforts, as we get a complete feel of the waterfall from beneath."
168,Worth it,"My friend and I took 3 local buses to get to the waterfalls, starting from Fort Kochi. I'd highly recommend doing this. It takes roughly 2-3 hours each way, but is a fun experience and a cool ride on the local non AC bus. Hanging out in the pools above the falls is really nice…"
169,Nature's Gift - Athirapally Waterfalls,"this is very beautiful waterfall and I took shower in the mist from the fall, saw many rainbows. It was mesmerizing to be there. Just looking at the fall with a force water drops from top to botton was very interesting"
170,Magnificent views,"The Athirappilly Falls are breathtakingly beautiful, especially when viewed from the Rainforest Resort. It is an unreal experience where one could almost believe that man and development had not ventured here yet. The falls look different at different times of the day....they…"
171,Must visit place if one is in Thrissur,"We drove by this place, but was too crowded to get down. We drove almost 2 KM to get a parking place, but only to return immediately. Lesson learned: Never travel to this on Sunday evening!"
172,THE NIAGRA FALL OF INDIA,An awesome place to enjoy the beauty of natural Waterfall. The real beauty can be viewed during rainy season. The place is quite decently maintained. The view and the feel at the bottom of the water fall is very amazing( must visit the bottom viewpoint if possible ) A place to…
173,Cool place to hangout,"The beautiful falls can be seen only from a distance.  The river leading to the falls is closed for access since the guards say that there are many glass pieces in the water due to the recent floods. You can go to the foot of the falls. However, if you have difficulty walking or have any type of bone/joint issues,  please avoid going to the foot of the falls as both the ascend and descend are very slippery and dangerous. As far as possible, wear only sports shoes or flat footwear with good grip. Avoid heels at any cost. Carry sunglasses and hat also. Entrance fee is Rs.50. Absolutely no plastic allowed. However you can carry water in tupperware bottles. There are a few snack stalls near the falls. Use public transport like bus to reach the Waterfalls if you don't have your own vehicle.  There are a lot of shops on the main road near the entrance to the Waterfalls where you get curios, toys and other snacks.  There are a few good restaurants also.  Police aid post and first aid post are available for emergency."
174,The Best waterfall ,"Taken this route through the palm tree plantations, its worth the ride, but roads are bumpy and also roads closes by 6.30 pm in the palm plantation. Start by 3 pm from Angamaly and return from Athirappally by 6 pm .  "
175,Breathing taking. ,"We went during november last week, falls is not dense and enjoyed bathing in the upper waterfall. Climbing down to lower waterfall is risky, elder people may avoid. We climbed down with my 5 year kid and bit exhausted."
176,Worth a visit,"Athirappilly Waterfalls are worth visiting if there has been sufficient rains. Having seen pictures and videos of these Falls immediately after a good monsoon season, we were a bit underwhelmed during our own visit as it was during a rather dry spell. The Falls didn't seem as majestic or beautiful.  However, the climb down to see the Falls and the climb back up is a good physical excercise in itself for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of physical activity.  My suggestion: get a feel of how the rains have been in Trichur and the vicinity before heading to visit these Falls. If the region has enjoyed a good monsoon, it is a must visit; else, it could be given a miss."
177,I heard bahubali sgooting was done here..visit in monsoon,"Do no miss this when you are around Trissur  & Guruvayoor. It is very beautiful nature.  one must visit this, if you have aged people or people cannot walk, then avoid going with them,"
178,Scenic waterfalls ,"It was rather disappointing that we couldn’t see the Falls from close, thanks to a strike by the workers. Looked nice from far..."

182,Beautiful Falls,"If u r visiting thrissur Athirappilly is definitely a must visit. Nestled admits the beautiful forest the waterfall is definitely a place to relax. For a more exciting trip, drive all the way to Valparai through the forest, if u r lucky enough u could be spotting some tigers and…"
183,Awesome day trip from Kochi using local transport!,Beautiful waterfalls approx 40km away from kochi airport. We spotted deers and many rare birds on our way to the falls. The infrastructure is not well developed and you need to trek for 30min to reach there. But the view is well worth the efforts!
184,Fantastic Waterfalls,excellent view. Thick forests. Crowded and poor parking facility.Few eateries and more roadside vendors.
185,Natural Bliss ..,One of the best water falls in India. It's in one of the most beautiful forests on the western ghats. Ideal for a picnic . Get refreshed in the  the cold river water. There are many good resorts nearby.
186,The Niagara of India??,It's a very nice place and very neatly maintained.but it's too crowded you won't be able to completely enjoy the beauty because of that.better to plan your trip accordingly 
187,Amazing view,"Do not cross the safety line. A great view from the top and good experience at the bottom. Do not miss the fall at the bottom, you have to take 1 km downstairs ....but dont miss it."
188,Fantastic falls!!!,Nice place to hang out.... Have to club Vazhachal falls also... Need to carry an extra dress to bath in the cold water
189,"Grand and mesmerizing, truly its Gods own country!","For better view it is best time to visit in the monsoon season. Full of greenery around, 80ft waterfall.  "
190,Weekend at the falls ,It is said that the movie Bahubali was shot here and the you can visit the falls from both top most part and at the bottom most part as well. Excellent place and must see place.
191,Beautiful waterfalls. Heavenly mist,One of the best waterfalls in Kerla. The famous film Baahubali shots here. Should visit this for its beauty.

195,The Niagara of India,"Went to see waterfalls in december. Locals say that water has dried up over the years. Did not find much of water, there was a scenic small waterfall for pictures."
196,View that will take your breath away,Athirapally waterfall is the best tourist attraction . But taking into account the number of accidental deaths the access is restricted. It's scenic beauty is par excellence. Rainy season brings out the raging fury of this waterfall which is awesome n breathtaking to watch.
197,best waterfall in India,"We were based at Cherai beach and Athirappilly water falls was located nearly 2.5 hours from our resort, but the trip was worth it. I believe Bahubali shooting was done here. It is worth trekking at the base and experiencing the jet spray of the waterfall. We were completely drenched, so it is advisable to take a change of clothes along with you. brilliant experience."
198,superb place.....,I found it more interesting to watch how the locals spend their day with their loved ones in the river than to watch the waterfalls. Do remember not to tempt the monkeys. The whole hike to and fro will take you an hour. You should not be spending more than 1.5hrs there. You might enjoy taking a walk to see all the small stalls lined up outside the entrance gate. Have fun!
199,"The ""Niagara Falls of India""","Its an amazing waterfalls near Kochi and a must visit water falls . Its very Dangerous during rains , but very present to watch the milky waterfalls."

219,Pleasure trip,I went from Thrissur to the Athirappilly Waterfalls. It is a beautiful place where you can see monkeys roaming freely. It is a perfect place for families.
220,great place but crowded,The beauty of this 80ft falls is captured in many movies. Athirappilly waterfalls and the nearby Vazhachal Falls along with the thick lush green forest area of the region is a major tourist attraction even during the Monsoon .One can reach the top of the waterfall through a paved path that goes through thick bamboo clusters. This is a no-plastic zone. A steep narrow path  leads to the bottom of the falls. The rocks are slippery there so its better to stand on the side and enjoy the panoramic view.
221,Beautiful picnic spot,Visited Athirapilly twice - once in April and the second time in October. The latter was far better! Due to the season in April there was hardly any water at all - just a little trickle. But in October it was amazing! It's clear why it's often referred to as the Niagara of India. There's also a lot of dragonflies which is nice!
222,We Had WOW !Experence.,The ideal time to visit will be monsoon season.You can walk down through the forest to reach the bottom of waterfalls.
223,Vacation ,It is the best waterfall in Kerala. You have to visit the place during monsoon. Have to take the ticket from forest office en route. There is two view points in the road where you can enjoy the full view of the falls and to take photographs. It is dangerous to step into the…
224,Awesome !!!,This is a waterfall with very good scenic beauty. During Summer there is provision for sale bathing. One can enjoy Trekking and scenic beauty alongwith a good natural bathing. During Monsoon the fall will be so ferocious with its wild beauty.
225,It's really  amazing ...,Athirappilli water fall is really amazing place to visit.it has really make us cool of it pure water fall
226,"Beautiful Waterfalls, should Watch Once in a Lifetime","If you are travelling with kids(especially toddlers) or senior citizens, you have to be mindful because you have to walk through a 2 kms of stretch with inclined and declined path ways. It will be very hard for senior citizens and parents with babies.  Carry water and some…"
227,An impressive waterfall,"The waterfall is close to Kochi airport and is within the route of Thrissur city and Kochi Airport. The waterfall can be viewed from two places, one from the top of the hill and the other from the bottom of the hill. From the top one can see the stream of calm flowing water and…"
228,A lifetime Experience,"We visited through car from thrissur, with a family of 4.Place can be easily located through maps and the way to reach the uphill is slightly hilly. May be little tough for new drivers, while experience can handle with ease. Though it is hot day, the view is superb and one can witness the chill breeze over their face. There is entry fee for vehicles and people including childrens. No major food at hills , you can have some drinks near falls, but one can find many hotels on the way. There is one petrol bunk on half-way mark to falls, just-in case if you lack fuel for vehicle.Cons: No proper parking for vehicles, all were forced to park on either side of the road."
229,Interesting view and Falls flow bathing (in the upper Deck),"1.the visiting time is from 8am -5pm,be early during vacations (other than off seasons)2.You can visit vazhachal and athirapilly in a single ticket.2.to visit thumburmuzhi you have to take separate ticket.butterfly garden and a hanging bridge across the river are the attractions.a good children's play area and jackfruit products restaurant also present there.3.Good restaurants are not available near these attractions.so it is always advisable to take food on the way before reaching athirapilly.4.if you are visiting guruvayoor it's around 75km from there on the way to Cochin if you plan to connect these three places it's an ideal circuit.5. Malakkapara/valpara around 60km from  here and the road leads to pollachi tamilnadu.you can enjoy the ride through this corridor.6.theme parks like Silverstorm, dreamworld  are near by."
230,Our first ride ,This is very familiar place in kerala. In kerala most of the people are visit this place such a super place and all of the people were remember this place.

235,a Wet experience,"Located 60 kms from Thrissur town, this is the most spectacular waterfalls in Kerala due to its height and width.

238,Waterfall s,"From Chennai we have been to Valparai via Pollachi. While coming back, our boys wants to visit Athirappilly water falls thus we have changed our route via Chalakudy that was the costly and unforgettable decision we made and resulted the following annoyance and crap experience.  …"
239,Magnificent view,Beautiful waterfall in the middle of a dense forest. 20+ KM long approach road through dense forest makes it all the more appealing. Must visit place if you are in Thrissur!  The entry ticket is nominal (Rs 20 PP) and the place remains crowded over the weekends. So visit during…
240,The Niagra Falls of India,Visited the Athirapilly waterfalls whilst travelling back from Guruvayur to Cochin / Kochi. Waterfalls are quite spectacular - especially from the bottom of the falls.

242,good ride and best place,"do get permission to drive up beyond vazhachal from the forest people. drive up towards poringalkuthu, on the way, you will cross the chalakudy river - old iron bridge, with the raging river below. great sight and a great photoshoot opportunity. drive a little further and you…"
243,"""Waterfalls""","I went to Athirapally falls in the month of January this year. While it was the end of winters, the falls were still pretty wide and wild. After reaching the Falls, we had to walk quite a lot downhill and none us were wearing walking shoes. So it was an arduous walk. My advise, please do take walking shoes which dont hurt your toes when you climb down.The view point opposite to the falls is rocky and there is a chance you may slip. Be very careful.Photograph the falls as much as you want. They are worth the effort down.There is a wire barricade at the viewpoint of falls.

270,Vazhachal water falls,"Athirappilly falls are around 80km from Ernakulum, out of which 30km road if from the local villages and jungle which is beautiful. This place is bit isolated but nature has really blessed this place. If you travel on weekends you will get a large crowd but on weekdays one can have peace there. On weekends car parking can be an issue due to small roads. There are two waterfalls nearby on the same river.  To get the actual view of main waterfall, one need to get down from the mountain for about 100 meters, walkway is already there. People are not allowed to enter inside the waterfall by local authorities due to past fatal accidents. For food, many small hotels are there where one can get a decent food to eat. Overall it’s a very good place to spend a day to relax."

273,Mesmerising,The falls located about 30 km from Chalakudy town of Kerala state. Plenty of road transport available for the 1hour trip.This falls of Chalakudy river is in Athirapally village. The road lies along the banks of the river with water keeps flowing silently and incessantly.Thanks to the good infrastructure built by the authorities. Nobody is allowed to enter the area near the falls as water falls from about 100 feet height.Really a nice place to get recharged physically and spiritually.
274,Couples,"There are 3 waterfalls at Athirapilly. At the top of the falls, there are calm ponds of water which many people bath in. There are no shower facilities. Locals warn us against bathing in pond as there are no alarm systems to warn bathers about release of water from the dam. We were told that people have been washed away when the dam is released. Even though locals said that water flow was low, it still presented a magnificent view. However, to reach the viewing area, you have to hike down a stony path which can be quite steep. At the bottom, there’s no viewing platform but boulders and stones which you have to climb on to get a good pic or good view. Not for the very young or old."

294,Not to be missed !,Athirapally Falls is located 60kms from Thrissur. There are Govt buses from Chalakudy. But better to hire a Cab so that can visit nearby Attractions. Entry Ticket is 20Rs per person. And we need to walk a lot to reach the top of the Falls. We Visited in Dec so water was very scarce. People can get into Water in the Top of the falls but its risky. There were warning signs that Dam may open anytime. Changing rooms and Washrooms were available. We need to Descend 400m to see full view of the falls. It can be avoided by elderly people. It was a Breathtaking View. Try to visit before 10am since it gets too hot and humid in daytime.Do carry a pair of clothes if you are planning to get into water. This place has lot of monkeys they snatch any eatable u carry in hand so Beware.Small shops and Eatouts are available.

Ticket window is few meters before the parking. The ticket includes entry fee for Vazhachal waterfalls which is about 3km from Athirappilly. In monsoon the falls was in full swing.

297,Must Visit,"Athirappilly Falls is situated in Athirappilly panchayath, Chalakudy Taluk in Thrissur district, Kerala. Athirapally Waterfalls are one of the best waterfalls in India. This waterfall drops from a height of 80 feet through several parallel streams offering a great scenic beauty. This is the biggest waterfalls in Kerala and well known for its scenic beauty.  About 10-15 minutes (may be more for older people) trek down from top of the falls will take you to bottom of the falls where the greatest beauty of the waterfalls can be experienced. Athirapally falls never dries out and can be visited anytime during the year. Though the waterfall appears in its full glory during monsoons, but heavy rains can cause great inconvenience, especially for treking down and then climb back. So, the best time to visit is from September to January. It usually takes 2-3 hours to explore Athirappally falls.Those who have more time can enjoy the beauty of the nature and the cool atmosphere. Lot of monkeys around which will be an attraction to Children. The entry ticket costs Rs.30 per person."
298,beautiful place,"One of the most beautiful and unforgettable experience of my life. Unforgettable because of two reasons:1. Because of the lovely waterfalls. Never seen the nature so close and beautiful.2. Because of the tiring, energy draining, exhausting trek to reach the waterfalls and worse even come back. But once u reach there, u don't want to come back. Though the waterfalls were not filled with water at this time of the year but during monsoons, it is. With small kids, it's very difficult. No no for elderly. My mom couldn't even reach upto the point where the river was visible. The trek down to waterfalls is rocky and uneven. Wearing shoes is highly recommended. Please carry water with u because there is not a thing available inside. But once u reach the waterfalls, you forget everything.  The ticket charges are too low and not required as well since they are not providing any service and maintenance. I feel that they should ideally be providing a trolley service to reach there so that everyone can have the opportunity to see the waterfalls. It's not to be missed kind of an experience but many have to miss it because they can't reach there."
299,Worth a visit ,"Athirapalli is around 60 kms from Thrishur town . The nearest railway station is Chalakudi , which is around 34 kms . There are several home stays available in Chalakudi for group stays and small group. Travel arrangements to the falls is made at the same place as well.…"
