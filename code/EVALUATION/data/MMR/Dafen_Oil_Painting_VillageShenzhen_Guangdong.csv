0,Take a little time,"There are some interesting things to do here, like get a painting class.  Watch Artisans at work.  But you have to spend a little time walking around and stopping in places.  Somethings are not so obvious at first glance."
1,A one of a kind (In the world I think?),"Nice experience to see the artists working in the streets,you can order your copy or buy pictures already done ,later they send them to your home or ship overseas . I saw guys copying from a picture sent by mobile.  You have a  big museum and also an old Chinese house refurbished  by an artist where you can sip a tea or coffee among works of art. We had a nice vegetarian lunch at the back of the village to the right, near a big brand supermarket,which was also a work of art because they reproduce exactly meat dishes and very tasty."
2,Great,A possibility to find beautiful artworks and see artists doing their work. Really a fascinating place to visit. We did not buy art during this visit but could definitely buy another time. Nice atmosphere.
3,Art lovers,Very colorful and interesting to watch the artists work. There are so msny varities of paintings. Give yourself a couple of hours to wander around. Its right off the metro line and easy to find.
4,Good activity,"Nice place to visit. A small village where u see painters everywhere painting imitation oil paintings. However, prices can defer greatly between different stores. Must compare prices before buying"
5,So.Much.Art! -- and art supplies!,Great place to come and check out stuff. Or to get artwork framed. Or even to buy some. But please make sure do not get ripped off here. Over priced. I mean 100% over price for some art work. So please make your selection wisely.If you want you can check Taobao and see how much they are asking for online. I saw couple i like and found it on Taobao. Exactly the same and price was around 70% cheaper. But i live in SHenzhen so i can wait for the shipping. If you really see something you like. Bargain doesn't hurt. A lot of artwork are not real. Some are printed. If you walk to the very end of some alleys you will see big printing machines there printing artwork. So make sure you know what your buying before you make a purchase.
6,Absolute must see,"great art, love geting lost in the little alley ways and all the artists.  We have our favorite spots that we have discovered and they paint amazing works for us - can't beat the price"
7,Awesome !,"A huge look into the world of the oil painters. Lot of small artist workshop where you can look at them during they work. Really interesting, there is also the possibility to purchase the paintings direct at the shops.Or you can give them a photo and they paint it into oil.They also deliver it worldwide...(they sayed so)!"
8,You Can Find Nice Original Art,"It was a good experience to see various paintings, styles, tools and techniques. Saw some artists at work. Relaxed day out. To avoid with kids as they will get bored and no time for parents to enjoy quietly the art works. Good Walmart supermarket also available for good and warm food."
9,Beautiful stroll,Best Place for Painting lovers.Great place to pick up art pieces.Here you can find a lot of 'copies' of well-known paintings and original art.accessible by Taxin Bus and Metro Subway Line 3.Near to Dafen Metro Station
10,Artists Galore,Go only if you are interested in buying articles and paintings. could find some copy of famous paintings and could buy at a better deal
11,The world mass production center of paintings,"We had a great day at the Dafen Oil Painting Village. Many artists, great people you meet and chat with, nice atmosphere. Prices vary a lot, but you can bargain and it's fun. Lots of nice cafés as well!"
12,A Must See,"A great place to spend between half day to one day. Went there a couple of times to help friends get paintings framed, buy art supplies (canvas, acrylic paint) and also to just explore the small galleries and alleys. Best way is taking the metro to Dafen station exit A1 from Longgang Line (blue one)"
13,Cool & beautiful works of art ,Had a wonderful day in this village -- seeing artists at work and never knowing what lies around the next corner.  The art supply shops were also very helpful.
14,Interesting experience,"Great place if you love art and decor. Creativity in abundance!Lots of walking so wear comfortable shoes. If you battle with paint fumes, wear a mask."
15,"Dafen Oil Painting Village, well worth a day trip!",The artists are amazing at painting!  It is fun to see the pictures being painted and the stores and collections.
16,Good way to spend an afternoon,Dafen is a great place to spend a day at. You will see a lot of galleries and artists who paint on the streets and are happy to talk to you about their way of living and art. I had such a great time there. <3
17,Fantastic Business trading Centre also a tourist attraction.,Many different master’s art have in there. If you really like arts. You should visit dafen oil paint. This place have a history in Shenzhen China. You will feel it when you go there.
18,Artist Village,I have been to this place several times and it is really nice to buy paintings and paiting utensils. I find this a real must go when in Shenzhen. The prices are also really good!
19,Nice Neighborhood Walk,"The 'village' is interesting, you can see artists painting a wide variety of things. Best part for me is the art supplies shops - there are a couple of them selling art supplies for half the price of in Hong Kong (and so other places, I imagine). Worth a trip if you want to stock up on paints, brushes etc, for kids or serious artists."
20,A Pure Joy,"most of the place is copy art... you can find great painters replicas and better to bargain. Also, have some studios of Chinese artists and I find that part of it more interesting. It's a good place for painting material shopping, also have a couple of good cafes. Altogether it is a good place to spend an afternoon  with friends or family."
21,One of the few places of culture in shenzhen,"This area is filled with cute cafes and beautiful art. You can wall around a window shop, buy cheap artwork or even make some yourself! The art museum is in the neighborhood as well and is free. The streets are small and cozy. It’s a nice peaceful way to spend a couple hours relaxing in Shenzhen."
22,An artistic tour,"We spend many hours here - really like the village and have found excellant artists to paint portraits and landscapes at very reasonable prices. There are many good frame shops to get your paintings framed inexpensivley.  Also lot sof art suppliers and shops for budding artist. Dafen can be reached by the metro, buss or taxi.  Also next to the Walmart if you need more than art to exist!"
23,"Loud, garish colours","If you want to have communication with local resident, you must come here. Talk about history and local food. They have coffee shop and chinesse best food"
24,Enjoyable afternoon looking at paintings.,This place is fun and well worth the trip even if you don’t want a painting. I have been a number of times and have been very satusfied with everything I’ve pirchased.
25,Long way to go.....,"You can get the stock paintings that they crank out all the time, and you can buy multiples and get a pretty good discount. I bought 5 and paid $100 USD total, so about $20/painting. I also bought a custom portrait painting of myself that turned out great. It took a couple of weeks, but when it was done I was thoroughly satisfied. The custom painting cost about $150 USD."
26,Amazing art & experience,"Dafen is where we go to relax,  to buy art and art supplies,  to walk,  to see artists in action,  to enjoy the architecture and the street vibe. There are art shops as far as the eye can see,  workshops that do framing,  printing and block mounting. The silk thread art is extraordinary but the oils and watercolors are why people go there. The original work is impressive but the reproductions are what make Dafen for me. Hand painted reproductions that are excellent but do not pretend to be anything other than reproductions."
27,Artistic cultural street,"This artist area of the city is so much fun to visit.  You can see copies of great master painters, originals, copies from photos or buy a range of art materials to use.  The little street are quaint but hot in the summer as every establishment is open to the street."
28,An art colony in shenzhen,Spent a few hours walking around and bought some nice art for good prices. Worth a visit if you are looking to buy some art!
29,Fun and interesting place!,"If you have an hour to spare and you like looking at art pieces or seeing artists as work, this might be a nice place to spend that hour.  The Dafen Art Museum is located in the village as well and entry is free."
30,Art for All,"If paintings interest you, then this makes a wonderful day trip. There are hundreds of shop selling all kinds of art, from the cheap and cheerful to average copies of Van Gogh and Klimt, to some stunning original art. Remember to budget lots of time, shops or painters have different specialties, so you will need to spend time walking around. Don't miss the Courtyard, a beautiful old house that it's also the owners gallery. Easily can spend 3-4 hours here not including breaks. Makes a great day trip."
31,Great replicas,I spent a very pleasant afternoon here. Don't miss going to the famous artist's house at the Sunrise Art Centre and the Dafen Art Gallery.  It's a short walk from Dafen metro station.    There is a huge amount and variety of art with everything from commercial bulk copies to the genuinely lovely and original.
32,Boogles the mind...,You can find a really good collection of art here although you need some time to go through the whole place and through the stack of paintings at each shop. Also you can find artists painting around the place and if lucky you could buy a fresh piece of art. Also there are options to give your pic and receive it in oil painting. The prices are very reasonable as well. The place also has a post office and you can post your paintings directly to your country.
33,Enjoyable place to go,"Listen, you are in Shenzhen, not Paris. It is still amazing to see art being made. There are people printing out masterpieces on canvas and applying oil techniques on top to create very good replicas. There are also some people doing original things. It doesn't matter, people are creating things and its cool. Also, get some lunch at the noodle place (look for vibrant blue tables) or dumplings right around the corner. If you are traveling with a husband... you can get him a beer at the convenience store and bring it to lunch. Just go."
34,Nice place to walk around and soak up the atomosphere,"dont expect new inventions, but quality copies of most masters. it is entertaining to walk around and see master pieces copied in various qualities. dont expect to find much new hard or real artists."
35,Amaizing place to visit,"More of a copy artists village.  Not a very big place, but one can pick up cheap paintings .A place to visit for the feel."
36,Fascinating place...,"If you like painting, it is a must go place in Shenzhen. Galleries, shops and exhibitions are worth visiting. Organized area with comparatively nice people there makes you feel good. Easy to go with a walk about 10 minutes from Dafen train station."
37,"Great time, even during Chinese New Year","You can catch a taxi from Louhu or the metro. Half a day wandering, admiring, perhaps buying some art and having a coffee in a rustic, trendy cafe make for a nice break from the frenetic shopping spree in Shenzhen."
38,Interesting day at Dafen,It is a very pleasant and artistic village. Every shop is unique and decorated tastefully. Nice to stroll around the village visiting every shop and museum
39,Fun visit,It is a very nice and small neighborhood to walk during a Sunday afternoon you will see the artists doing their own artwork and also copies of famous paintings. The paintings have good prices so if you want to buy some art remember to bring Chinese Yuan because they don't take anything else and it is very hard to find someone who speaks English. Also if you want to eat there is only Chinese restaurants so be prepared.There's also a Walmart around the corner that is worth a visit.
40,Very useful for art sources,"Great place to visit.  Unique, peaceful, smells like oil paintings.  Lots of talent in the village, no pressure sales happening."
41,Art colony china,"I read every review on tripadvisor before I came. Well I'm an art lover and I spent 3 happy days in the village. I bought art supplies (really cheap) and art drawing books that you cant get elsewhere. And of course looked and looked at all the art works. Many art lovers pooh pooh the place, it is a copycat, there's no artistic merit etc but I think otherwise. In the western world, people pay obscene amounts for an unmade bed littered with condoms and hundreds of millions for a painting. Isn't that more questionable? Most art enthusiasts aren't collectors so we aren't rich so dafen has bridged that gap by making art accessible to the masses. Sure most of the paintings look about the same, western landscape, classical ballrooms etc but it still takes skill to paint it, even if it is over a computer generated image. You have to think about how to get the shading effect, the mix of colours, it takes skill. My only grouse is that there aren't any decent hotels nearby, mine was quite run down. Still I.enjoyed myself thoroughly and might consider returning to take art lessons."
42,WORTH A VISIT,"Many artists flew to Dafen from all China, so you can find different types of business related with art: from art studios, to framing shops or art schools."
43,Great Paintings,This is the place where you can buy all sorts of reproduction paintings but there also original paintings by local painters. The place is quite distance from Shenzhen city centre.
44,Cheap Masterpieces,"Enjoyable afternoon looking at paintings.  Many are hand painted reproductions of famous paintings like “Starry Night” but many are original artwork, both oil and watercolour.  Long taxi ride but worthwhile. Nice cafe at entrance for cold beers and drinks.  Of course, bought a beautiful original watercolour painting for 350 Chinese Yuan, about $70.Canadian, to take home."
45,"A Great & Memorable ""day trip""...","I live in Shenzhen and went here to frame some paintings that I had.  Ended up spending half a day here walking around.  First of all, take a taxi here.  We drove, parking is a total and complete nightmare as this place is really a village within the city, very little parking.  Lots of galleries and people painting in alleyways here, pretty cool to see basically painting manufacturing in process.  We didn't buy any paintings but wow, framing is cheap.  Framing a pretty big painting with my chosen frame wood, background and glass with something like Rmb 150.  Couldn't believe it.  Took about 30 minutes, you can watch them cutting the wood etc, which is cool by itself.There are cafes and restaurants around here as well.  So you can see some paintings and then go have lunch.  Foot massage places here too if you want.  Altogether, not a bad place to go for a half day, definitely a unique place."
46,Worth a visit,Great place to pick up art pieces. Bargain unless they say firm. Cute for a half day of walking and shopping. If you have lots of time you can also have paintings made.
47,How to meet the local ,"Pretty good. Lots of paintings for sale, or send a photo on wechat and have a custom painting done. Cheapest with low detail, had a nice size work done for 160rmb in an abstract style. Don't plan to eat here, there's nothing in the area that's really great."
48,More than just shopping,Lovely to wander round the streets and take in all the Art.  Bought some fantastic pieces at a reasonable price.  it is a really interesting visit and worth the time to wander the streets.
49,Getting up and close to (almost) classic paintings,"Beautiful artwork!  Fun just to see or if you're looking to buy, it's very affordable. I make sure to go each time I visit Shenzhen."
50,Interesting art district,Dafen village is a place where you can meander and watch people paint multiple pictures in next to no time. If you are an artist it is the perfect place to get supplies. You can also find are coffee shops and bars around if you feel that you have taken in enough art for the day.
51,Custom Oil Paintings,"An absolute must do when visiting Shenzen. Amazing to watch the artists at work. Prices vary depending on what you are looking for. I have an artist that does all my paintings. I email the photo from Australia and when he is finished he posts home to me. Does an awesome job. Had the opportunity to meet him and pick up my paintings this time. Language barrier quite difficult, but usually an interpreter around somewhere who understands basic English.Could spend a whole day in this village.Not as easy to get a cab from Dafen as it is to go there, but there is a train station if you know where you are goingBig Walmart across the road for shopper aholics"
52,"Not quite art, but ...","This is a good place to go and buy oil paintings from makers directly. Note that there is a complete range of prices you will encounter and to get better prices you might have to walk in some of the side roads.We came across a shop selling small media panels at 15 yuans each. The place itself is well connected via Dafen metro station, just walk past the Walmart."
53,Great place to visit but not a good place to buy stuff,"Cool, artsy village with lots of oil paintings to admire and stores to browse through. Great finds at good prices if you look close enough. They have a few cafes and snack places there as well and I'd say 2 hours is plenty to walk and see most of it. Took a taxi there and back, wasn't a problem. One of the few ""urban villages"" in Shenzhen, 60% of the world's oil paintings came from Dafen at one point in time."
54,Arts Galery,"This place is amazing. You will see modern paintings, old master's repros, sculptures ...  You name it, it's here. I'm sure 80% of the artwork you buy anywhere in the world originates from this village. It's worth a visit ... It's hard to walk away without buying something. They will arrange shipping for you"
55,A very cool part of town on the way to the art museum,"As the name given - Oil Paint Village - upon arrival, you can see all the painting workshops there, lots of them. Large variety of oil paint for selection and if you have your own photo, you can find some shop there to make the Oil Paint for you.  You can do lots buying as business. Worth spending time to visit there."
56,A Must for the Art Enthusiast,"Developers are closing in on this charming place where you can see artists painting in the alleyways. See it before it's gone. You can also buy all kinds of art here, or order it to your liking."
57,Simply amazing!,Enjoyed a great day with students from our school touring the DaFen Village. Great bargains and lots and lots of different paintings to choose from. Definitely an interesting place to visit and explore! Many small alleyways with artist busy painting copies of some famous artist as well as creating some of their own great works.
58,A Wonderful Day Exploring Dafen Oil Painting Village,"There are small and medium sizes gallery-like stores with copies of famous painters, but the real attraction lays on the small streets surrounding these buildings where local painters offer their work for a few dollars and are willing to paint from a picture in just a few minutes."
59,"Dafen Oil Painting Village (Dafen Village), one of Shenzhen's famous attractions","Great place to shop around for some art to bring home. Good value whether you get pricey or cheap art. We got a great embroidery for about 1000 CNY, that obviously had many, many hours of work behind"
60,Oil painting village,"Did not really enjoyed much, but there where nice paintings of course. A lot of portraits of Chairman Mao."
61,Interesting villiage,"My fiancé and I visited Dafen to shop for paintings for our new house. We found many talented artists, beautiful works and reasonable prices. I love visiting Dafen.I highly recommend stopping in to one of the coffee shop galleries near the main parking lot for an espresso.  Great way to decompress after walking through all the small lanes of shops/galleries."
62,Amazing Experience,Ample Art works depending on your budget from cheap too expensive. Spend the day. Get there by Metro / Subway.
63,Definately worth a visit.,"Worth a visit. So many art supply stores and lots of painters at work in their galleries and outside on the street. If you need to decorate your home with art, this is definitely the place to go. Painters here copy famous original paintings in record time (and also create their own artwork). Everything was incredibly inexpensive."
64,Cheap place to buy painting,I live 5 months of the year close by the painting village and it is a good visit just to look at what is on offer or for the professionals to buy equipment or painting.
65,Relaxing and not too touristy,A good place to lookout for art materials. Many choices and prices are very competitive. Glad to view many original artworks at the art museum.
66,Great place,"the place is massive, full of painters and painting.. once you decided to go think what u need before u go, other so much offers to choose from, that u will get confuse.."
67,Dafen Art Village,First visited 15 years ago. Many studios then and you can talk to the copiers. Now just shops full of copies but some originals.  Only 1 in 20 has anything of interest. They now do a lot of  online business.
68,"Not just paintings, picture frames too","Take 300RMB and you can get a family portrait in many different styles.  Lots of great art for you to browse in many different forms (water color, oil, pottery etc.)Good for at least a half day."
69,"Worth a visit, even if not buying art","Looking for a nice fake? Need a painting of your own picture, or just something nice on the wall; a place to go."
70,Interesting place,I bought many paintings from DAFEN OIL PAINTING VILLAGE.  These artists are excellent and the management knows how to take care of its clients.  Great job.  Happy repeat customer.
71,Amazing place in Shenzhen,"I never saw a place full of painters and paintings, I took pictures of them painting and selling paintings in front of them even there are signs saying no photo...Some of the paintings are out of this world, well I truly believe some are miles better than the Sunflowers, or Potato-eater? I do. Yes, some are just very very ordinary. In general I think the local artists are highly recommendable. One simple trouble, that we could not find a decent restaurant, we finally went to an expensive one, but the food was so ordinary which, when I was consuming it I thought I was in England..."
72,Culture in Shenzhen,"I'm not a big art fan, but I loved this little painting village! Been there several times since my stay here in Shenzhen! Definitely a great place to come to if you ever visit Shenzhen! You can also see the painters at work which is pretty cool! You could also haggle and get a really good deal on a painting! Also you could even buy painting supplies, which I did!"
73,Nice place to spend a relaxing afternoon.,"Interesting place to visit with many works of art. A lovely place to take a stroll and my friends bought a beautiful piece of Chinese oil painting at a reasonable price. Also sculptures and small souvenirs like embroidery purse from the Miao clan. I love the Sunrise Art Center, a beautiful art gallery with a cafe which I will review separately."
74,Good copies of original works for your walls at home!,So many artists to visit with genuine talent. For us a great place to shop for a souvenir With a bit of difference Original prints are painted on canvas and can be rolled and kept safe in a tube.
75,Unique Place with street arts,"Don't shop immediately - walk around, price everywhere and negotiate. Don't go to early as some shops wont be open yet."
76,A great choice for custom paintings,"Lots of Chinese paintings in one place.  Trickling of contemporary art when we visited, thought it may change in the future.  Interesting experience."
77,"Art, tea house emerse in the culture! Worth the subway ride",Highly recommended to set several hours aside to explore at will and also possibly visiting the museum.  Some artists are into copying factory mode while others are truly producing genuine work.  There are treasures to be found here!
78,Perfect oxygen bar for our brain !,The oil painting village is very hugeYou can see painters live making paintings from a photo on an iPhone or an small imageInteresting to see
79,This village is amazing. I have never seen anything like it.,An interesting art district with lots of small galleries and artist accessories. about 10 small lanes took about 45 minutes to walk. Could have spent a lot more time going into a few of the galleries. They are all quite small.
80,Great Painting,Fascinating village of small streets with painters set up and everything you could imagine for painting on sale. Worth a quick visit
81,Oil painting area,"Fascinating watching the artists at work. Plus easel makers, canvas stretchers and artist studios. A very special one is in an old traditional building entering through around doorway. A must for any visitor."
82,See it before it disappears,Good place to visit for a day by underground from Hong Kong. interesting place to visit. Lots of painting and good price.
83,Cheap generic art pieces,The title of the place says it all. You will see paintings! However you have to find the village first. With very few people speaking English we got there using the station signpost  or rather a photo of it. Over 65s travel free by rail. Best to have your passports with you to proof your age although we just pointed to our grey hair!!!
84,In awe,"it's an interesting little village with lived painting, good street food, good ambience,  it's worth a visit"
85,Dafen,I visited here to take photos of the faous shops and street. It was easy to find with the help from a gps map and a good taxi driver.there is a tea shop/ gallery at the end of the main street which is very nice and relaxing.I would recommend going on a clear sky day as it really adds to the colourful streets
86,It's the art haven,"Streets upon streets of art. It was such a great experience to walk around, see people copying from computer screens but also see some great originals being created. There are a few little cafes sprinkled throughout the area. I highly recommend anyone that is in the area to make the trip and come ready to negotiate."
87,The artist enclave. Don't miss it.,"I love this place. You get to see so many style of paintings and so many sizes of them too!You can even commission your own paiting if you so desired, beside the myriads of replicas available for you. Price wise, it is pretty reasonable, from the cheap to the expensive. It is hard to put a price on a piece of art, I guess."
88,Incredible,"If you´r looking for a paintings this place is for you! You can find anything, from cheap imitations to real unique and original pieces of art! You can spend hours there.We went on Chinese new year holidays so most of the shops were close, but we love the place."
89,The World’s Art Factory+framing in a morning,Had a few hours while visiting Shenzhen and took their very easy to use Subway to Dafen.  So interesting to see the artists making copies of famous works of art.  Each and every street is packed with little studios.  Well worth a visit to see.
90,Strange and pleasant.,"An interesting place with art for everyone, a wide range of paintings and embroidery in many different styles, some originals some copies or if you want a portrait or something specific you will be able to get it done here. Only down side being a foreigner like most places out of town is that the language barrier can be a problem so have a local with you or try and use your phone to translate. But a very interesting place and a couple quirky cafe's around too. Don't be afraid to walk down the side streets and go into shops, shop owners and artists are more than happy for you to view their work and watch them creating their paintings"
91,A great place to find an artwork bargain,"You might find some cheap paintings to bring home, but for larger and more expensive works, it is better to buy via Taobao and negotiate for a better price. You might get free shipping thrown in to safe you the hassle of having to haul one back!"
92,Worth a few hours of your time,The oil painting village is a beautiful place to take a casual stroll through. The artists paint works ranging from original pieces to copies. It's definitely worth it!
93,Best Place for Painting lovers.,Little oasis in Shenzen & amazing art. Good coffee but almost nothing by way of food. Have commissioned some art & also bought 'off the wall'
94,Human xerox,"I have mixed reactions to the painting village.  First of all the painters are extremely talented and produce magnificent paintings for sale.  They sit on a small stool all day long with a picture in one hand and a paint brush in the other creating paintings worth much more than the asking price.  We were told the painters earn about $10 to $15 per painting they produce.  As a professional artist myself, it was obvious their work was worth much more and they should earn hundreds of dollars on each.  Their paintings would make beautiful memories of an experience you see in various regions of China.  However, after buying a painting, I suggest you personally give the artist a generous tip for the beautiful piece of art you purchase.  There is a constant problem in China where images are taken from well known works of art infringing upon copyright laws then reproduced in these painting villages.  The artists are making a meager living but you can't help feel guilty for taking advantage of the original work of art and the artist creating their own version of it while earning so little.  The artists are delightful to meet and grateful for your purchases.  I highly suggest you pay a visit."
95,Interesting. Worth visiting. Language is a major difficulty.,I was fascinated by the size of the Village. Everything the art enthusiast can think of is there. Lots of painters but some of the specialists were very impressive. The silk thread hand stitched on to material to create three dimensional pictures was very impressive. I enjoyed the 'copy artists'. Reproductions of many well known masterpieces were in various stages of completion with the artists hard at work. The restaurants looked a little dodgy so we didn't try the food but friends have told us that there are a few restaurants that do adequate food. Dafen is on the Metro and easily accessible by bus or taxi.
96,Excellent,My husband and I visited this area during the Chinese New Year.  Even though a lot of the shops were closed there were still several open for business.  This is a great area to go even if you aren't planning on buying anything.  The selection is vast and definitely could fill the appetite for all tastes!  We plan on going back during a regular day to get the full experience.
97,beautiful paintings,"A very interesting place with rows of painting shops lying in a village. All the shops are in small scale, like a family business. In every lane between the shops, there is a painter drawing under light. No matter they are copying, or they are creating original painting art work, you are unable to neglect their skills and hard work. Some may comment that they are copy machine yet, who can well define the term of “art”. I see some inspirational artists, creative art performances (which had went on TV shows).The village reveals  a way of living, a chain in the commercial world, the spirit of a painter, a chance to think about the subject of “art”."
98,Take a look at how oil paintings are mass produced,I enjoyed the experience of buying artwork from someone I could actually see painting. Prices are very reasonable within the alleys.
99,Great place to see the artists work and buy art,Went there thinking of there being a museum and some type of history behind this. Very misleading. There's just alleys of art shops. Nothing much to see if you're not interested in buying some art pieces.
100,Photogrphy trip,"This is one of the best oil painting exhibitions places I've ever been to! You can expect to find over 500 different kinds of paintings ranging from grandmasters to amateur students, all great looking though."
101,Fascinating but may need to go with someone who knows it!,"To walk around Dafen and see shop after shop chock full of paintings is to be amazed at the scale of the business that Dafen represents. Enjoy the walk, talk to the shop owners. Marvel at the artificial quality of the area. Simply amazing."
102,Get what u need in Painting,"First stop went to A artist cafe in the village,lucky for us that come across a small concert. Really enjoy the envitonment there. Tony made excellent Latte and has been very helpful he give us some advices where to go in shenzhen and some history about this village. the village is not so big but still took us 5hours walking theres so much intersting things,place,peoples to discover. Will definitely coming back again."
103,interesting to walk around,"I worked near Dafen painting village for several years and had occasion to visit it many times.  There are hundreds of shops, an exhibition center, and thousands upon thousands of paintings and other artistic items.  I have had several paintings made from photographs and had copies made of famous paintings--all with excellent results (to the eye of an average person).  To get the best results you have to chose your artists carefully, but it is possible to get reasonably priced copies as well as original art.  I highly recommend a visit if you like art and paintings.  Plan to spend a few hours."
104,Great place to visit!,"This is where many of the reproduction paintings that you see on the internet come from.  But I would guess that around 10% of the paintings are original, which is still a lot!  Amazing selection."
105,Must visit place.,"You can't go to Shenzhen and not to stop by Dafen village, it would be a real pity.If you want to buy something you need to bargain, I personally had a lot of fun doing it. There's no need to go with a local friend, you can get a cheap price for the painting anyway if you are good at bargaining."
106,Great way to spend an afternoon,You can spend the entire day sinking in the beauty and atmosphere of the place. Talented artists all around you will end u buying something or the other.Beware of counterfeits. Take time to observe the painters its quite a rewarding experience.Get down at Dafen Village MTR and walk towards Walmart. Its on the lane next to Walmart.
107,Beautiful afternoon,"I really enjoyed this excursion. I was staying in Shenzhen, saw that Dafen was a subway stop, jumped on the awesome subway, and was there in about 30 minutes.  Once I saw the Wal-mart, I knew it was just down the steps to the right. We walked around the little streets and alleys, watched the artists paint, found some fun (inexpensive) paintings. It was a nice morning out.  I highly recomend that you go see it and just wander around.  We also went to the museum (which had nice bathrooms) and just looked around there, too."
108,"Art everywhere, peaceful and sympathy : a must !","I enjoyed visiting this part and even bought a painting. Well worth nice atmosphere, prices are excellent."
109,Interesting,"I was amazed to visit the village and saw how many Monets and Renoirs and other modern chinese paintings were available for as little as 350 RMB.   But most interesting thing was not the coping of old masters but the real artists in the village.  For example, paper cutting is a real art form and I was able to see those artists at work.   You can find real interesting things in a most obscure art shop.   Be open minded for what these painters can do...."
110,Good,Absolutely a must visit place if going to Shenzhen.  We picked up some neautiful framed art work - definitely get it framed as you will not get such quality at home for anywhere near the same price.  But make sure your credit cards work in China - we ran into money issues due to 4 digit pin numbers and none of the EFTPOS machines accepting them.  English is also not spoken by many of the store owners so we had to depend ion Google translator.
111,Fun Afternoon,"I really enjoyed my visit to the Dafen Oil Painting Village. I could get lost walking up and down the laneways looking at replicas of some of the greatest artworks in history. Getting a replica isn't to my taste, but this is China, and China loves a good replica! That said, it is very impressive seeing these painters recreate these classics. Replica in my opinion is its own form of expression. This is for art lovers, but in the bustling city that is Shenzhen, it's nice to step out into something more tranquil."
112,The highlight of our trip to Shenzhen.,In Dafen village you can see many artists working on copies from van Gogh or other famous artists. Some also make their own artwork. It is a great place to wander around and I always get my own artsupplies there
113,Meeting Art in an unusual way,"I have visited here with tourists, and also as an art buyer. There are many different styles and mediums of art here, not just oil paintings. If looking to buy several pieces, try to use just one shop, in order to get a better price. They will arrange shipping to another country for you if needed. If just browsing as a tourist, it's definitely a to-do in Shenzhen. You can get there by subway, a couple of hours is enough time, and there are local cafes and restaurants, and a large park adjacent to the village."
114,Interesting Place!,I am from US and wanted to bring back some moderately priced art.  Was worried that Dafen Oil Painting Village would only have copied art but found a wonderful shop that had embroidery art.  Bought three small works for 600 RNB.  Just what I was looking for
115,Some very talented artists-,"It definitively worths a visit!Hundreds of small shops with locally produced paintings. Many different levels of quality and price, so it is better to look around the streets before buying. Some cool coffee shops also."
116,Turn left beyond Walmart and a strange world emerges,"I bought a few nice pieces. If you see something you like, buy it then and there! Head into the middle of the 'market' for good finds and cheaper prices. There are a lot of European pieces, but some great Chinese pieces too. They are tough to bargain with but can always get it down.To get there: go Defan metro station, take exit A and go down the right set of stairs. Keep walking in that direction past the Walmart and Gong-Cha on the corner. You'll see that from the Gong-Cha the path no longer follows the road, keep going, go down a few steps and look to your left there should be a sign."
117,Always Fun,"If you are into art this is a must visit place in Shenzhen, one of the few places where you can actually experience some culture in this city."
118,A true gem,"Avoid the main shops just selling the finished art around the perimeter as you’ll pay more for no reason and miss interaction with the actual artist.  If you want to come here, it’s not only for find an oil painting you like, but also to meet and chat with the artist doing the work.  Personalizing it. I took the MTR subway to the Dafen station (blue line).  Take the South East exit (I believe) which gets you across a major road.  Walk down just past Walmart (great bathroom pit stop or water resupply if needed).  Just below Walmart is the entrances to this oil painting village.  There is a long row of shops covered here selling the art.  Skip this part as it’s more costly.  Take time to walk down the many rows of artists doing their trade.  Most of the ones I saw used  a photo, photo card, or an electronic device/iPad as their reference for a painting.  There were a limited few who seemed to be original, so you have to seek them out.  Everyone has their speciality.  Once you find someone and like their work, you can ask them to  paint to the size you need. To get things framed here is relatively low cost.  Due to the quantity of paintings we bought, it made sense to frame everything and pay the higher cost to box it in a wood crate and air freight it out of China.  All can be done here.  Just watch and inspect the work as the quality level especially on framing/packing/boxing was not at the level I expected.  This may not be worth it for most.  If you are only buying 1 or 2 rolled it up, and carry it home.  If you have a photo of something you want painted, bring it.  Most artists need 1-3 days to get any custom work done.  Skill levels are all over the map, but you can get something that is “good enough” at a fair price.  Example of pricing:  better quality work was ~RMB450 in the 80 cm x 80 cm size.  Most work can be bought for well under RMB200 depending on the size.  Don’t expect to find a top tier artist here.  Either way, it’s an interesting place to walk through and observe.  There are a few little food shops here…I tried one and it was really good."
119,Oil painting village is amazing ,"Always a pleasure to wander around the alleys and streets of the district watching the artists, especially those artists painting multiple picture simultaneously.  I enjoy watching the portrait artists.  Just outside the village, across the main road, is an art mall selling large pictures, the type displayed in large hotels etc."
120,An absolute must do,"I spent the whole afternoon there, watching the museum and the paintings, the artists doing their paintings copying pictures from their mobiles... saw how easy is painting a van gogh!! :) :) I liked the vibe! Couldn't resist the temptation and bought a couple of pieces."
121,Evolving ,"We visited Dafen Oil Painting Village in October and had a fantastic day. We were lucky enough to have a local friend with us to show us around and do the bargaining for us. Our local friend mentioned to us that the prices for the paintings were much higher for tourists so doing some bargaining is a must! To start the bargaining, we would recommend halving the asking price. There are a handful of funky art cafes in the area and a really lovely pottery shop. Overall, we really enjoyed our time and highly recommend if you are in Shenzhen : )"
122,Great place. Don't rush. Don't go too early.,"most of the place is dedicated to making art so its different from art spaces that Ive visited. But the set up is just an experience you have to have. I enjoyed seeing how quickly copies of famous paintings are turned out and then if you walk deeper into the village you can see original art from locals. Go down the side streets,  walk into the shops and definitely buy a souvenir."
123,A Unique Experience! Not to be missed!,It was an interesting experience to visit the famous painting village.  Plenty of artwork to choose from at a reasonable price.  However the quality varies quite considerably and most of the paintings look like artworks by high school students.
124,You should see the place where the oil paintings come from,"Now this is a must go place if you are in Shenzhen.Curious where the 'art' in your local store comes from?There's a good chance, someone from Dafen painted it.Most of the work done here is replicating famous pictures or photo's. (Want grandma as an oilpainting? Go here)I spend hours walking around in the little streets. Wonder off if you want to have some unexpected encounters.Bought an original traditional watercolor painting of fish, a traditional blossom branch printed on silk (we actually went to a little workshop in an apartment close by where they put the silk behind the painting).And I found some great photo's in a little art gallery.Take a little shared taxi back to Shenzhen and you've had a great day."
125,Masterpieces everywhere,what a sweet little village. i found a lovely silk clothing shop with lovely clothes. Not very busy. Take your phone with an app to translate the language or make sure you can speak the local language.
126,Gorgeous oil paintings and exhibitions: 24 Nov 2012,"There are hundreds of painters in this area. It's confusing for first-time travelers to find because the ""village"" is a series of apartment high-rises in the far-Western part of the city. The subway takes you directly to the area, but finding a road or alley to access it requires some effort. It doesn't have an enormous sign announcing its location. In fact, I find the fastest route is behind the Wal-Mart.Once in the village, you'll understand how it got its name. There are hundreds of painters. And while they all want to sell you something original, their bread and butter is painting your portraits.I'm hoping you have taste and you don't want a knock-off of Van Gough. Please, don't buy that. It's tacky. Instead, bring several copies of a favorite photo. Included additional close-ups of facial features. Let them keep the photos. In 2-5 days you'll have a fantastic portrait that would cost you $1,000 in the US.Don't overnegotiate the price unless you want them to rush the quality. Instead, tell them ""I'll pay a bonus if the work is exceptional."" An extra $25.00 bonus will incentivize the painter to put extra effort into your painting.Expect to pay 1/10th the price you would in the West. A $1,000 portrait will be $100. If its 20 bucks, its going to be crap. If its $200 you are overpaying."
127,Little Art Village,"We had limited time in Shenzhen but our daughter wanted us to arrange for a couple of paintings from the Dafen Artist Village.We took a taxi from Dongman to the village - only a few dollars.We set out to find an artist who could produce the style our daughter wanted and immediately became aware that language would be a major issue. Finally with the assistance of a Malaysian tourist we managed to convey our requirement and settle on a price. Photo's of the required paintings were exchanged and taking a great leap of faith we paid in cash in advance including the anticipated cost of mailing to Australia.If the paintings arrive and are of the quality expected, our daughter will be pleased.Unfortunately having completed the deal we had to leave immediately to pursue other commitments. In the short time we were in the village we gained the impression that there were many shops displaying artwork however very few artists actually engaged in painting. Perhaps if we had explored further we may have found more artists."
128,Favorite Thing to Do in Shenzhen!,Had a wonderful day with great lunch at the village. so much to see although there is a lot of the same paintings being done by many. Have to be patient but can get some genuine bargins.
129,once you are in Shenzhen better to see it once,Great place to visit and see so many oil painting shops - time constraint - will go again - hopefully during my next trip.
130,A must visit for art lovers,Here you can find a lot of 'copies' of well known paintings and original art. It is worth a visit. And paintings are cheap.
131,amazing artwork found here,A big village surrounded with shops with all kinds of natural art and paintings. Most of the shops are owned by the artists who sell their own paintings
132,"as the name said: Great Fun, or ""A lot of fragrance""","If you're looking for some original prints, this is the place to go. The different stalls and styles will cater to any art lover out there. Be prepared to haggle the price !"
133,A free experience you won't forget,"I travel to Shenzhen often. The hotel offered advice on where to go on my days off. At first I was thinking, "" hmmmm, artist village, BORING "" , but I went despite my initial apprehension.   The most amazing place I've ever been. I bought many paintings and sent home to America. Framed them at home. Now, Dafen is a must trip when I go to Shenzhen."
134,Great visit,"A little out of the way and bigger than expected, Dafen Art Village is an interesting place.  There are hundreds of art stores with many different styles, prices and sizes.  Very cheap too.  Best thing being there is no pressure to buy!It is a little out of the way and there are few places to eat but a quaint place very different to the rest of Shenzhen."
135,Quality can vary,It is easy to get to the painting village by metro.They have many different paintings which they can ship anywhere in the world. There are also lots of coffee shops where you can get a drink.
136,"90% Kitsch,10% hidden treasures",We bought 2 silk embroidered scenes from a shop and brought them home. It is a fascinating experience to see so much art
137,Anything you deserve can be duplicated here...,"There's some nice shops in the first plaza that stretches to the museum just of the main road but the remainder of the alleyways were less than impressive.  Some of the copies were ok.  They'd never pass as forgeries.  But a lot was just awful...faulty perspective, bad proportions, poor colors etc."
138,good if you like art,"I had read a lot about Dafen Village and was eager to have a look for myself.  It is a really fascinating phenomenon, but hard to get a real sense without someone who knows the area.  Also very hot in the summer!  Perhaps it would be nicer in the fall, and with someone who has connections to local artists.  Quite accessible by the subway."
139,Amazing talent.,"It is a interesting place to visit and see the artists producing the oil paintings in a ""conveyor"" mode. There are dozens of them , some work in studios , some in open air. The paintings are outstanding and look like the famous originals. They are priced by square foot and you can get it shipped home with all certificates. Not cheap as I expected, and a good example of the Chinese entrepreneurship."
140,Surprised how enjoyable seeing the artists at work was,"for this place, it is quite unique.  Easy to get to (Dafen metro station, follow the signs, keep walking, pass a Walmart! and you are there).  It is really cool to see the artists painting or copying mostly oil paintings in these narrow corridors that are formed between the 2-3story buildings that sell art or make frames.  If you look hard enough you may find really nice ones and if you dig even more you may get some fine watercolors (aquarelles) that are authentic, pretty, exotic, and easy to transport  (prices are as good as in Korea or better).   I must say that I visited the chinese Walmart and bought little things and chinese munchies to bring home - even paid with my credit card, although no one spoke English."
141,Wholesale art,"Went on a flying trip on a very hot day, but I do love this place. It is interesting to note the ""trends"" in the paintings, they are different from my last visit here a few months ago. I watched a few portraits being done from photos, the quality is excellent. I was very close to commissioning one myself, there is a guy specializing in pet portraits, and they are amazing. A long cool drink at KK Gallery was much appreciated before heading back to the border. Lots of art supplies, can't attest to their quality, but they are there. everyone is smiling and friendly even if English skills are poor. We caught a taxi both ways as it was a scorching day and we were time poor. We have gone by train before, but wouldn't waste the time again. Taxi cost us ~ RMB60 each way."
142,Great for a Sunday walk!,"Hermitage is not interesting anymore, when you can go to Dafen Oil painting village! Worldwide masterpieces lost their value, when you can see what Chinese can paint for you hereOf course they don't make unique picture, they just paint something from exist picture, they make a copy, but really good copy. If you need something extraordinary or make a present for someone, you are welcome to Dafen oil painting village!"
143,cosy ,"I am not a artist or truly appreciate the aspects of art like many, but very much enjoyed this place. So many great pieces to casually walk around and see. It is in a quant little village and not to far walk from subway. I will visit again in future and shop for art once I get a apartment in Shenzhen."
144,one of our favorite spots,"Looks like there might be some artists, but mostly vendors selling what looks like prints with a little paint slapped on.Lots of replicas of famous artwork.There are *some* painters, but few and far between. Some will do portraits for about 1600 ¥.Many vendors carry the same items in multiples.Not much room for negotiation if you buy.Very very hard to jail a cab after we left the area."
145,A very cool art district,Very good experience observing the artists producing different styles of art in a street-free artistic environment.
146,Must see,"Great place to find unique, space-filling paintings for any room in your house.  Real paintings are much more meaningful than posters or prints and impress any guests we have over.  For more money you can also commission your own portraits.  Make sure to find someone with examples, because some artists are better than others.  While this costs into the 100s of dollar, a nice 3x5 foot family poster will be the centerpiece of your living or dining room for a decade.  Sadly, the prices have risen significantly in the past few years, though with subway access, it's much more convenient to go there now."
147,Great shopping,Lovely pedestrianised streets of galleries. Amazing artists of all different media - you cannot fail to find something you want to buy.
148,Absolute must-see!,"Must go and see this place when in Shenzhen. It's a hike by metro, but easy to find after you get off the Dafen stop, walk past the Walmart it's the second street on you left. Then you'll meander the maze of streets and allies full of artists."
149,Art,"Bring a camera for some great pictures of China's ""Montmartre"".  The first time I visited I went in the early afternoon, and the place was deserted, so I recommend going a little later when the lighting is better and there is more foot traffic.There aren't many places to eat nearby, so you will want to grab lunch before you go here.  It is also a good idea to wear sturdier shoes as sometimes there are nails / staples from the framing shops loose in the road.There is a website for the village where you can purchase paintings internationally, and it seems all shops have methods to ship your purchases back to your home country.  English is minimal, so go with someone who can speak Mandarin and is good at haggling."
150,Oil painting / art village,You will be blown away with the talent that is within these streets when it comes to the oil paintings they produce. The best thing to do is make sure you go to the small gaps between the main walk ways. This is where you will see them sat peacefully paining away and where you will get a real bargain. Make sure you check out the painting your going to buy in detail and press them for a cheap tube carrier to take it home. the final tip is carry it on the plane or it will either goi missing or get bent by the thuggish baggage handlers.
151,"Very unique, peaceful, lots of talent","A place where you can get Van Gogh replicas for less than $50 each. There are also many other replicas while some are original artwork. Art supplies are also available. There is also an art museum which entrance is fee of charge. Take the metro and alight at the Dafen station. Walk for a few minutes, entrance is at your left."
152,Art for everyone,"It was amazing to see all the artist diligently working on the art. Although I did not buy anything, I will be back again. Some incredible art"
153,A living vibrant public attraction,"I really enjoyed this area, hundreds of shops selling any kind of paintings at very good price, also custom made arts, reccomended for all the tourist"
154,A Must See if You like good art,"China has talent and a lot of it, in painting as in making semiconductors and toys. The name understates its importance. It is only a village in radius (about one mile in radius), but allegedly this is the global production center where 90% of the world replicas of master works were reproduced. These talents also do not only apply in reproducing the da Vinci's and Michaelangelo's of the world, they also extend to creating original Eastern, Western, and Fusion originals and replicas of family photos in oil or acrylic. On a Sunday night the place is deserted from tourist but still witnessed a few artists and students busy at work. This juxtaposition of Venus, David, Deng Xiao Ping, and Chairman Xi is a little eerie and disorienting"
155,All of the artwork under the sun,Very high quality paintings done by people who obviously are gifted in the art of painting.  Some of the works were originals while others seemed to be reproductions.  I saw several paintings of Xi Jinping and I think the artist had painted him a little younger and a little better looking.  LOL!
156,Good place for buying an oil painting,"I did not personally visit this painting village, however, a friend took 2 Picasso photos of prints that I liked and had them replicated by the artists at Dafen.  They did a great job painting the 26"" x 32"" canvas' and I feel I sort of have a one-of-a-kind treasure."
157,Quirky little village - a must do,"Dafen village worth a visit, and 1/2 day is sufficient to walk around and even have a snack - traditional food and some local delicacies, such as durian, are on offer. Very simple to get with the metro. From the metro, it’s about 10 min walk. Interesting art work, some authentic painting. Most of the galleries have air conditioners inside. Take your time to decide if you want to buy, and don’t be afraid to walk off and then to come back. If you want a portrait (or a custom order painting from a photograph) done, give it 7 days if you want to take it back with you. Otherwise, most of the galleries offer shipping service. Have cash on you, as only some places accept credit card, and drive a hard bargain to get the best price."
158,Nice day at Dafen Oil Painting Village,"I absolutely LOVE Dafen Oil Painting Village! The artists navigate unique art styles and emulate them SO WELL. For nearly one-third of the price, Dafen Oil artists can offer your favorite painting by your favorite artist, or even the replica of a personal family photo. Don't forget to bargain them down though...Especially as a foreigner traveling through their streets, you smell like money. Start off taking them down from their original price by [HALF] and then work your way up in 10 to 20RMB increments. Some will walk away and not want to bargain...that's okay. You'll find the painting somewhere else...This is a DAYTRIP. If you're planning a vacation with family and/or friends, plan to have Dafen as one of the only things you do for that day!:) :) :)"
159,Amazing amount of paintings ,"We came here with our friends on travel from France to seek for talents, color, traditional and trendy arts ... we were completely under the charm of the Museum (free entrance) and got lost in all the narrow streets where you will see painter, sculptures, all chinese styles or western ... and try the cappucino at the Art Coffee in front of Leonardo Da Vinci !"
160,Commitment to the arts,I love oil paintings.... though am not an art guy. I love how they look and that is what matters to me not that they were painted by a particular person or this is the first time someone every did X. So the fact that everywhere I went I could afford any beautiful thing I saw was amazing. I bought a few and mailed some back from the post office in Dafen and some from the Hong Kong Post office. All of them made it to my home. It fun just to watch some the people paint as they do everyday. A must do if you ask me... even though there were very few tourists there when we were there.
161,Top attraction in Shenzhen for culture lovers (and everyone else),Just a few blocks beyond WalMart and down some stairs leads to a world apart from norm! There are dozens of artists all busy making copies of the original works of others; there are dozens of framing shops to make your purchase look terrific on your walls; and there are many color printing shops making copy after copy of both paintings and photographs for the artists to sell. The artwork is average but I am sure that they sell a great deal in order for so many establishments to stay in business.
162,An interesting place to visit.,A bit far from where we are but this place is a must go to in Shenzhen. Paintings done by amazing humble artists! You could see them doing it and watch with amusement. Went here to have our grandparents wedding black and white picture be painted and it was UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!!! We bargained and got it for what we think is a good price.
163,Pretty Cool Half Day Trip!,"I bought 10 paintings. Not only fake VAN G. available. A lot of original art, modern and classic style. Place worth to visit."
164,"For Art Lovers, And Buyers",Such a beautiful place to walk around and visit.  very easy to arrived due that it has metro Station. Its a must when you visit Shenzhen.
165,Best attraction so far in Shenzhen,"Da Fan is an impressive place. Imagine that a majority of the art you see in hotels around the world are manufactured right here in the north east of Shenzhen City. It's a village packed full of small galleries selling all manner of paintings and styles, art supply shops, and the occasional cafe. Walking around you'll see many artists at work, sketching on large canvases or finishing the last details of a painting, their work space a simple corner of an an alleyway. Some are original pieces, custom orders while most are copies and reproductions of varying quality. If you're in Shenzhen for a few days or live here, it's definitely worth seeing for the scale and diversity of art onsite. You can even commission some pieces for a reasonable price or pick up a fake van Gogh for $12 or less."
166,Fun Trip to See Artists and Buy Cheap Paintings,"The amount of ateliers and galleries in this artists' village is simply overwhelming and one can easily spend most of the day here. From copies of all famous paintings varying from decent to good quality to original art, all is here in Dafen. Highly recommended for a day trip to see a different side of Shenzhen!"
167,"Art for the masses, go see it!","This village is like an open- air factory, but will little alleyways where I saw an artist painting with one hand, looking at the image on a mobile phone held in the other hand. Interspersed are many small shops selling paintings , also a framing area, with nearby a small but interesting art gallery. I found a little corner cafe for a bowl of noodles at lunch- time. The village is a short walk from Dafen station on line 3( quite a long way on the train, but the fares are cheap and a pre- paid card makes it easy). It was quiet in the village, and no- one seemed to mind me wandering in and out of the alleyways."
168,Very interesting weird place,"I went there during my one day trip to Shenzhen and really enjoyed Dafen. I wouldn't go there for high quality fine art shows etc. - it's more of a curiosity to see an arts village full of artists coping great masterpieces or painting portraits on order in their studios. Having said that, if you're looking for nice decorations for your home, you'll definitely spot few original works there that you'll like so it's not all just copies of Picasso, Monet and Van Gogh ;)"
169,Great experience,"We came here to buy material for painting as it s recommended (lot of choice for all materials and cheap). We also enjoy the Art Museum but lack of time and we didn't check the street art above the museum. Anyway just walk, open your eyes, mind and heart... enter some shops ... check what you like and enjoy the moment ... also the great coffee in front of Leonardo Da Vinci has beeb renewed and is serving good coffee ... i bought 2 oil paintings for good price (for me ;) ) : Hong-Kong view (40rmb) and the ""stars on night sky"" of VanGogh (450rmb).A unique experience to live far away from speedy life of Shenzhen"
170,Interesting Place,"This is a must do if you're in the area whether you're into art or not.The artists are massively talented reproducing existing paintings as well as producing their own work. The work itself is undervalued and you can pick up paintings for as little as £3.To get there you need to catch the MTR to Dafen. When exiting you need to exit the steps to your right where you will see a Walmart in the distance on your left. Head to the Walmart and you'll see a Gang-Cha on your right, cross the road and follow the steps down where you'll see a sign pointing left to Dafen Oil Painting Village."
171,Beautiful ,"Was brought to this place by a friend who lives in shenzhen. we wandered about the streets and found a couple of quirky cafes hidden on the 2nd level of a few buildings. Great place to just have a coffee and watch artist painting, some of which were painting huge (wall size) elaborate paintings of china's scenery. Compared to the streets selling painting in vietnam, cambodia, the level of artistry is just astonishing here. There are many hidden gems to be found if you are looking to hang some very realistic paintings of animals (eg pandas, cats and dogs, lion etc) in your home. some of the paintings were so real you could almost see the real texture the panda's fur.Very impressed! painting here are also pretty inexpensive and affordable."
172,Well worth a visit even if you do not like art,"It is a matter of things like age and taste. I loved Happy Valley, it is a lot of fun but of course packed with kids. Windows On The World was interesting and one off -  i enjoyed it but got bored. Dafen i just love. There is so much character and personality here. I love all the alleys and the artists painting in their funny nooks. I loved the smell of the oil painting. Without question there are countless reproductions that you get sick of seeing, but some really are stunning, and there is some original work too. There are a few lovely little gift shops and a truly stunning cafe. It was not crowded on week day when we went. I would be happy to pop back there a few more times."
173,Not a tourist destination,"Claims to have painters imitating the great masters, but didn't find many doing that, they were mostly producing tacky imitations of cheap popular styles of landscape.  Not so easy to find as there are few signs to help. Basically get to Dafen on the metro and come out of the most south easterly exit, walk about 200m past a Walmart and the area is off to the left beyond some shops."
174,Amazing art!,Many smaller alleys as we venture further into the village where we found interesting and original paintings. Attractive price.
175,Art Art Art!,"Decided to make a visit from Hong Kong to see this area. Was a little nervous if I could easily find it, but thanks to other reviewers it was quite easy. Wandered around the various streets full of painters, shops, supply stores, and galleries. I spent a few hours and did not see it all. I was able to find a few pieces I liked and negotiate and am happy with my purchases.Yes there are a lot of reproduction works but also originals.  It was quiet with few people seeming to be wandering and shopping like me. But no one seemed bothered by me going in and looking around. My limitation was that I only speak English."
176,Good place to experience small town Chinese art,"I really enjoyed visiting this place, strolling from one shop to the other. I spent a wonderful afternoon visiting the Dafen village. It is really great to see all those busy painters. Quality is very variable but there are some great stuff to bring back."
177,An extensive collection of artists and artisans showcasing copywork and original paintings in a nice setting to enjoy!,"One of my favourite travel experiences in China. Friends and I ventured into the village during the early evening and got beer from a local convenience store. We walked around until we found a painter we found interesting and would sit and watch them paint. Many people were really receptive to this and would offer us chairs and try to make conversation with us in broken English.The food in the area is excellent. I'd advise  you to get there in the late afternoon and spend a few hours walking around. It's a really pleasant way to spend your evening. The art is good quality and because there are so many painters all in one area, competition is high too, which gives you good bargaining power. The only thing you need to worry about is how you're going to get it all home!"
178,Great place to explore,"Accessible via Metro, quite a long ride. Many little shops exhibiting paintings. Fakes and originals. Worth a visit for enthusiasts."
179,Great to walk around,"We set out one day just to ride the subway to see Dafen Oil Painting Village. It was quite a long ride on the train but well worth the ride. You can expect to see a very real view of rural life in China.  Bamboo fences, meat market, and rows and rows of little buildings, sidewalks with artist painting all day. There is a tea house in the middle that is a delightful stop to take a break and take it all in. The paintings and art work were a variety of prices but easy to acquire for any price range collector.  I would encourage any travel to make this must do stop, on a beautiful day."
180,Dafen interesting but not what it used to be,"This area is dedicated to artists, calligraphers, painters creating their craft.  there are also a myriad of stores selling brushes, scrolls, and paper for hand done calligraphy."
181,This place is just the best,Hundreds of painters creating amazing art.  Custom work done for a reasonable price.  We had two old photos painted for about 900 RMB.  You could send them a digital pic of yourself and let them do a portrait.  Or find cheap paintings already framed that give a splash of color and character to your home.
182,Hard to find but good seeing,"Dafen is definitely worth a visit. Whether looking for something to hang on your walls or just looking, it’s mind boggling. What I didn’t expect was how many framers there were. If you have something you need to frame, drop it off first thing in the morning and agree to collect it a few hours later. Tips: take an address of the Art Village written in Mandarin to show the Taxi driver. Do the same for your return journey too. Take lunch, snacks and water."
183,An Interesting Place to Visit,"Have heard and ready many times about this place. It's a bit outside of the town, but by the subway it's easy to reach.Take your time to visit the place, beside the great paintigs you will also finda few cool bar."
184,So much fun!,"do walk around if you have time to spare. spend 1 or 2 hours here, dont miss the alleyway as they also sell paintings in the alley. If you are a muslim , there is a muslim restaurant to stop and eat."
185,really interesting place,"We were able to acquire a few really nice and affordable pieces, then went over to the tea garden to relax under the trees and later to an upstairs eclectic bar/bistro for a delicious bite. A good day trip not to miss."
186,Great place to visit !,"Roaming around the narrow streets and alley ways of this village, you will encounter hundreds of Art Shops.  The vast variety of topics, styles and techniques used by the artists is simply amazing. It is an experience not to be missed during your stay in Shenzhen."
187,"Art, Oil Painting, Art Supplies","This place shall not be recommended. All you see is painters duplicating originals. Cop copy copy. No creativity, no culture. I have seen more creative artists in small villages across China than in dafen.And I am not talking about the liters of solvent thrown in the gutters.Pass on."
188,nice day to visit,"Good idea for visit if you love art / photography. Unfortunately we arrived at 09.00 and it still close. So we just eating, sadly can't find person who speak english but the food here was here good and super cheap"
189,This place will blow your mind with the talent,A fascinating place where thousands of paintings are sometimes stacked waist high for buyers to purchase. It is the worlds painting assembly line. A few blocks over are dozens of framing storefronts as well. The artwork is generally well done but unoriginal. You can stroll these streets that are maybe 6 city blocks wide and 5 city blocks deep with hundreds of artists painting everything from more simple oil paintings to very sophisticated large ones.
190,A gem,It is rare to meet art in this way. Both artists who do they own original art pieces and those who help others.Nice area to stroll around in and possibilities for great purchases.
191,Nice place ,"Fun to see all the different art. Some of it's tacky, but there is actually some really great stuff here at v cheap prices."
192,Very interesting place ,"If you want a momento of your visit to this area, this is an amazing place to go to. The quality of the paintings can be superb.They can reproduce a family photo portrait into an oil painting in a couple of days!!!They also sell a lot of reproductions of great masters however their own original pieces are well worth a good look."
193,Painting for Evereyones Interests,"Dafen Oil Painting Village is a must-see place for a lover of art. There are a series of streets with one shop after another selling oil paintings, some originals, and some copies of world famous works like Da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Van Gogh's Sunflowers. For a fee, one can get the artists there to paint a copy of any work that one wants. The village also has the interesting Dafen Art Museum, which showcases work done by local artists."
194,Beautiful paintings,"If you like art this is the place to be in ShenZhen.  As the name of the village says ""Dafen OIL PAINTING village""Here you'll find 100 and more little and bigger gallery's full with art.  Should see !"
195,Spent a short afternoon looking round.,"It was a good day to visit Dafen Oil Painting Village, Shenzhen, China. We walked around the painting shops and appreciated wonderful painting works. It was also fabulous to visit the Dafen Art Museum. There are lots of restaurant around, where we did enjoy our lunch and dinner. More importantly, the village is nearby the Dafen Metro Station, making it easier to get to."
196,An afternoon trip.,Just an interesting place--unique--good value on  art pieces--a safe and comfortable walk about space
197,Good for art lovers,"The Dafen Oil Painting Village is a great place to explore during your visit to Shenzhen. Plan to spend at least an afternoon if not the whole day exploring. It is easily accessible via public transportation. It was originally an Hakka village. Now the ancient houses and alleyways are the sites for artists, framers and shops dedicated to the production of oil paintings. This village is considered the largest oil painting production and export area in the world. Bring a photo and commission an oil painting from an artist that you like. Framing shops are available for you to get your artwork framed. There are art supply stores with a wide variety of supplies that you will never find elsewhere. We spent some time exploring the village, buying art supplies and taking numerous photos. We took a break at the Sunrise Cafe and Bar for tea and goodies. It was  delightful to sit, relax and take in the ambience.  I purchased 2 pieces of art - an oil painting and a hand stitched silk fan. It was great to meet and converse with the artists. Both artists were friendly and eager to show me their craft! This is a great place to visit for all ages!"
198,Such a lovely thing to do..great getaway from Lowu Shopping Mall,Spent a few hours in dafen with four adults and one child. Lots of shops but seems to have gone very commercial. Only a few artists painting and watched numerous tricks being unloaded with paintings to be sold that were obviously produced elsewhere. Some of the shop owners were picking and choosing the ones they wanted. Seemed strange. Is very hot there and you have to hang on to your kids as there are many things laying around where they could hurt themselves.
199,Negotiate & Come With Photos; You'll Get Amazing Results!,You have to walk a distance from subway to reach this place.You can see artist painting sceneries from either a picture or handphone.There is a nice teahouse with lots of handmade pottery on display.
200,Great Place,"Most of the things in the ’art galleries’ are just hideous copies that I would not dear to hang on any wall. Parisian, Venetian, etc. scenery with very loud colours. Most things are not ’oils’ as the name of the place implies but acrylics. If you are a fan of flower and scenery paintings and wrong perspectives then this is your place to shop. I do not think any of the copies should cost more than a few euros - max 30 eur for an extraordinary and very large size copy.There may be some finds to be made if one is willing to go through thousands of canvases on piles. They tend to put the most hideous ones on display - maybe they appeal to the Chinese audience best. Frames can be a bargain here. Also the Chinese calligraphy brushes may be something to buy as a souvenir."
201,Fantastic place to visit,"Oil painting area is an amazing area for art lovers. It's not easy to find and in 200 meter there is no sign of that. When you get inside the street, you will find some masters who are making masterpiece. Some fake works could be found too. If you are looking for painting tools here is the location."
202,Good afternoon out,"The quality of the painting varies but is is not expensive to get a painting done. Usually, leave a digital photo with the artist and discuss on the details of the painting. Normally takes at least 4 weeks for the painting to be done. They can mail it to you or can do self collection. Self collection is better since further modifications can be done. But it takes time.  Over the last 2 years, I had about 4 paintings done but only 2 are 'presentable'."
203,Industry of oil painting,"Far away from downtown Shenzhen , close to a Walmart lost in the suburbs ... You easily find The place to be for painting , art cafe , in blossom art museum and street art. All is free to visit ... If you want to discover , to escape or to get an original or copy of painting... This is the place . ... You will find also everything to do it by yourself. Enjoy"
204,"No Frills Art ""Neighborhood""","I didn't have high expectations of Dafeng, but it was actually pretty good. The village is easy to visit as there's a metro station nearby. The village is within a 10 meter walk. It's quite big and requires at least half a day, or perhaps a day if you are an art lover. The village has quite some legit creative artists, but the majority are unfortunately simply copying famous artwork and paintings. Never the less, it was pretty enjoyable to walk around.The restaurants nearby aren't great. It doesn't give me a hygiene feeling, so do bring some food with you or eat in advance. Regards, Teasenz"
205,Beyond Expectations,Sooooo many talented artists sit in narrow alleyways painting away from copies of great artists copying artworks of renown. Here you will find all the tools & goods required by artists. Some very old buildings amongst this all too.
206,Great day out if you like artworks,"Its pretty far away, especially if you're staying in Shekou, but it is absolutely worth the trip! Yes, there is a lot of crap. And yes, much of it is by no means original, but there are actually a lot of really great options to be found. We got our hotel in Shekou to call us a cab. He used his meter and it was around 105RMB to get there and took about 40 minutes. Would have taken a lot longer on the metro. Also, we were able to communicate well enough that we arranged for him to come back and take us home which was really great because we had bought several pieces each. Highly recommend also the KK Gallery and Cafe which has lovely balconies, great snacks and drinks, a wonderful gallery (too expensive) and really friendly owner."
207,Great for art lovers.,"We went with our 10, 12, and 15 year olds.  It was fun to walk around and see all the artists at work.  Bought our first original piece of art.  We would like to go back and buy more."
208,Absolutely lovely!,"Dafen Oil Painting Village is full pf painters churning out artworks that one finds in department stores and home decor stores. You need to visit every store to find the gems. Dafen is not just about paintings, they sell everything painting related, including picture frames of every imaginable size and variety. To get there, take the Long Gang subway line to Da Fen station. Exit A2 and walk about 200m."
209,Fascinating place,"This is not my first time in Dafen, I use to come here since I came to live in China 5 years ago, and I use to come sometimes to see the art or to help some friends to know this beautiful place.It’s not difficult to go, or you take a taxi or didi from anywhere in the city or just take the Metro to Dafen metro station, from there you have few minutes walking to the place.One you arrive there you can find different shops where you can buy all accesorios if you want to paint by yourself but if you want to find some paintings that’s your place.There so many different kind of shops, some are art galleries where you can find original paintings from famous painters that you can see cause the stamp in the paintings.Also you can find paining shops with more comercial paintings , modern art.... also very recomendable if you don’t want to spend a lot of money.Anyway it’s awesome to walk around and see how good they are paining or doing some replicas even doing the pint I’ve you bring them , just need to negóciate good the price with them.There is one cafeteria where you can relax for a wile, also very special place cause it’s very artistic place full of paintings and expositions, coffee is good!They can send anywhere in the works what you buy them, remember China is business 100%"
210,Awesome place,"If you are a painter yourself, oils or acrylic, this is a must place to come. Here are numerous art supply shops selling acrylic paint in 1 l jars or smaller in vast quantities. Or oils in 180 ml tubes, brushes etc supplies. Acrylics are priced from US$ 1.60  for 250 ml jars up to US$8 for 1 liter jars. Oils are between US$ 1.60 to 3.50 for 180-200 ml tubes. So a bargain compared to anywhere else. Bring your suitcase ( empty), as you will go crazy here. All kinds of brushes as well from 30 US cents each. The best way to get there is to catch the metro to Dafen on blue line, take exit A1, follow along underneath the train line towards town, past Walmart and you are there. The first street you get to has a building on your left with covered footpath, cross the road and on your right you will see a lane with some art supplies shop. Keep going along the lane and you will see more art shops, you can compare the prices , but they are to be generally the same. In this general area there are quite a few art supplies shops. Go crazy!"
211,Painting paradise,"The narrow alleys and multiple shops make it easy to bargain for that perfect piece of art to hang on your concrete wall.  Whether you love modern art, or are looking for someone to paint you an original, it is easy to find someone willing to accommodate you for the right price!  A must see in Shenzhen!"
212,Great day out for fake and real art,"Of course the most paintings in the streets are not so good, most of them are copies, but in my opinion it's not important, because atmosphere in the streets is amazing. And you can find very good art museum in this area with very good paintings, I was supersized. A good place to walk alone."
213,Weather ruined it for me,"It was raining the day we visited and a lot of the stores were closed. After wandering, we did find some artists painting and a few stores to browse in. Interesting how it was set up and it was along way out from the jade factory we visited."
214,Awesome if you love art,"Defen is a great place to spend the afternoon. I was there at 3pm on a rainy Friday and found endless alleyways of artists working from photos, postcards, and images on their phones.  I only noticed about 3 other tourists that afternoon.  It is a bit far out on the train, but well worth it.  Another reviewer gave great directions from the metro.  Recommend."
215,Interesting urban village,"Unfortunately we visited the week following Chinese New Year and didn't realise that most places (including restaurants) would all still be closed, so there wasn't as much as normal to look around. But the advantage of that meant that it was also a lot quieter and more relaxing - no crowds! It's lovely to walk around, the place is a real maze with lots of little side streets to explore. There is some amazing art here and some fairly average art too, as well as lot of the same pictures being sold but they will all tell you they're the 'original'!! Be prepared to negotiate and if you don't speak the language, make sure that you have a very good translation app that both parties can speak into in order to communicate effectively - it takes a while to get through, but otherwise you'd be completely lost! It is also possible to show them photo's that you'd like re-produced and some of them will paint them for you and then ship to your address - for an extra fee of course. But worth it, if you have something special in mind. In terms of location - it's very close to the Dafen MTR station and it's marked as one of the exits and pretty easy to find from there"
216,Great for afternoon trip,"Wanted to see a bit more of Shenzhen on my 2nd trip so caught the Shenzhen metro from Luo Hu. It was very crowded on a Sunday afternoon - made HK look quiet ! You have to queue for the ticket machine some of which don't work. Pretty straight forward, but not as efficient as HK. It was maybe 20 minutes trip and I think we had to change trains. An alternative way would be to get a taxi which are cheap, but best to get someone to call one for you (like a hotel) if you are not a Mandarin speaker.The village itself is close to the metro stop and easy to find with google maps. Spent an hour or so walking around. Nice atmosphere and people friendly. English is not widely spoken but that's okay.Went to a tea shop for a cool drink. No English so pointed from the menu. I like the fact you never know what you will get.All in all it was a nice afternoon doing something a bit different."
217,Pretty Neat Artwork,"I saw a documentary on Dafen and thought it might be worth a look whilst in the area. It was quite good, I went yesterday (2/3/15) and did see about 10 or so original artists in the act of creating. They didn't seem to mind as I paused to watch them for a while, used to it I guess. It's quite amazing to see the blank canvas come to life.It gets a bit 'samey' after 40 mins walking the streets, so I took a breather in the local Art Museum which was exhibiting work by young artists. China has some real talent! Although this is an 'Oil Painting' village it was good to see some different works which seemed to leap from the canvas too. It's free to look around and I wasn't approached once to buy anything, so it was a worthwhile couple of hours for me."
218,Get away from the busy city and visit a creative & calm place,"My son and I visited on a Sunday. There is a mixture of quality original art and ""assembly line art"" There are also artists that do portraits from pictures.     We both enjoyed walking the alleys and seeing artist  replicate the same painting over and over again. sometimes 2 or 3 at time.    But for us, the best part was buying low priced paintings for souveneers and gifts. We purchased 7 paintings for under $100. Most of the paintings directly from the artist."
219,A must visit in Shenzhen,I didn't really know what to expect here but it was an amazing place: loads of varied artwork to buy and just look at. It's also really affordable so you might just end up buying a tonne of stuff!
220,Bad smell,The Dafen oil paint village was easy to find and freely accessible. We got the metro to Dafen and walked pass the Walmart just 5 minutes after the metro exit. The village is filled with small art galleries and art saleaperson as well as painters. A lot of the painters copy well known art works from photos they find online. Some of the replicas are quite good. Chinese paint brushes and ink is sold  in some shops (from 1.50rmb to 40rmb...) and other art material as well.
221,BEAUTIFUL OIL PAINTING VILLAGE.,"I live within walking distance of Dafen Painting Village (DPV). For me, it is a relaxing tour through an Oil Painting Museum. I am not in the habit of buying art, so I can't tell you about buying art.But DPV probably has a hundred art boutiques. They range in quality from high brow to upstairs in the back attic. There are sometimes very expensive cars in the parking lot. Products range from mass produced coffee shop décor to full height wall murals.Of course, most of the art is oil paints, but there are assortments of frame galleries, statuary, pottery, art supplies, small fountains, and a medical clinic. Purchasers come to buy job lots of paintings to decorate hotels, restaurants, and shopping malls. Private individuals come to buy art for any room in their house.There are factory made paintings and individual artist paintings. There are painters that will convert a photo to an oil painting portrait. There are others who will paint your favorite Van Gogh or Rembrandt or naked lady. Marilyn Monroe over the air vent seems to be everybody's favorite!You can find small oils for USD$4 or USD$5 and wall-sized paintings for, I guess, USD$10,000.If you are passing by Dafen Painting Village, you should take a look. There is no admission to any of the shops. If you are looking for a serious art purchase for your company, then you really need to take a look at what they have in Dafen Painting Village.If you are looking for an original Van Gogh, you will need to go to New York or Paris. If you want a copy, then Dafen Painting Village should be on your shopping list."
222,Only if you like Paintings,"We only had a short time to explore this village, but were captivated by the variety and styles of art and craft on offer. We will definitely be returning to explore further."
223,Mostly Paintings copied from photos,"I came during Chinese New Year and the place was literally 95% closed, and it was still an awesome day. I found a female artist who painted a portrait of a young Mao. (I bought it. Only $50 US. An amazing value.) I paid an artist to paint a portrait of my daughter from a digital photo. I paid him $200. He said to come back in several days, but I was leaving for home in two days. He took my address and promised to mail it to me. It arrived about a month later- the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. This place is a do-not-miss!"
224,Nice village concept and interesting Art galleries,Be aware that you are not meant to take images of the artists who are working. At the very least you should ask permission or you can also make a purchase.It is lovely to wander through these lanes to see the artists at work and seem come of the more extravagant works. Seeing artists make copies of famous works of art from an image on their phone is quiet impressive.
225,Interesting,"You can't beat it.  I can spend hours and hours here.  These are some of the best copycat artists you will ever see.  They can replicate anything.  There is some pretty good original stuff too and it's fascinating to see the different styles of all of the artists one after the other.There is no better place to purchase art in China.  Not that I'm aware of.  You can get beautiful work done for WAY cheap.  Bring a picture of your grandma or your old farmhouse or childhood tricycle or whatever hits you in the feels, find someone who has a style you like, and have them paint it for you!  You can, of course, give them an address to ship to, or pick it up in a day or two."
226,So this is the source of hotel artwork,"been there for to spent a nice couples of hours, i did not regret it, a lot of different artists, great prices compare to europe or USA"
227,Must See in Shenzhen,"I probably missed something, but I wouldn't call this an ""artists"" village. It is commercial, as is most of Shenzhen. There are many people on the street and in shops doing mediocre copies of famous paintings - if you want home decorations this is definitely the place to go! If you are thinking this will be a gallery or museum experience you will be disappointed. In the main square there is an old-looking Chinese building w a round doorway, inside is a small gallery and tea house - this is my favorite part of Dafen. Very relaxing, very pretty inside, great place to end your shopping trip. Small entrance fee can be put towards purchase of drinks."
228,Amazing Artistic Skills....,Be careful and negotiate the prices. Would help if you take a local with you to negotiate on your behalf. Its is well worth a visit and you can get stuff done at a reasonable price. Ensure you shop around first. don't just take first offer either.
229,Fantastic Artwork,It's a place in shenzhen where a large number of artist community live together You can almost all type of paintings there It's not in downtown There is paintings from cheap to very expensive Wide range of paintings and handicrafts Regards Vk
230,Too quiet place. Not ideal if you're not interested in fine arts.,"One of the real cultural centers of the fast-changing city, Shenzhen, if you want to experience creativity and see something unique do not hesitate in giving it a visit. Cheap paintings with a very good quality. It is one of my well-kept secrets here."
231,A nice place to Visit and walkabout,Dafen Oil Painting Village is easily accessible by metro and worth a visit.The village is not big and the paintings are well done though they are mostly copies.We could not resist buying two small ones as souvenirs.They were well wrapped and we brought them safely home .
232,Fun!,"As the name suggests, this village specialises in ""works of art"".  It started out about 25 years ago with only 20 artists... and due to demand from visitors/travellers as well as from Around the World there are now estimated to be over 1800 artists--- mostly ""trained in various techniques"".  There are many interesting (small-ish) galleries with copies of well known works of art-- but one can also ask for a portrait.  Be prepared to bargain... or check out on Alibaba's ""Taobao"" online marketplace, to get an idea as to the ""online"" (more competitive) prices.  The town also has many very enjoyable restaurants and coffee shoppes.  This is a highly rated day trip!!I hope that this Review has been helpful."
233,Chinese loca painters,"This is an area, not a village, that is accessible by subway in Shenzhen.  It is worth the trip.  Take the longguang line and exit at the station.  You end up walking through typical local communities and then you can't miss it.  It is a maze of HuTongs and small shops all catering to the art crowd.  You can buy reproductions, and art supplies and even innovative one of a kind art there.  It is well worth the trip.  I especially recommend that you visit the museum that is tucked away off to the side.  many awesome paintings there."
234,a really cool stop,Highly recommend going to Dafen make sure you hire an English/mandarin speaking guide We used Albert he was fantastic as we had portraits done and he was able to explain to the artist what we liked. I have included his website plus he is also on whatsapp.
235,ART VILLAGE,"If you are into any form of painting, be it water, oil or plain sketching, you should visit this place. It consists of a number of rows of shophouses but the real action is in the alleys where you can find the artists at work or people paying for a lesson. There are also shops selling painting and art supplies."
236,old masters cloned squared.,"I visited Dafen Oil Painting Village and expected to be bored but to my surprise this village of painters and artists is actually quite interesting. With all the different paintings from replicas of famous paintings to Chinese paintings and modern paintings. Really beautiful, talented and artistic painters. The price of the paintings are negotiable and you can get the paintings at a good bargain. So if you are looking for beautiful paintings  to buy for friends as gifts or to hang at your house this is a place to visit!"
237,Art Supplies Beyond Belief,"Thrilling, enchanting and full of fun. Great artists - cheap knock-offs and a nice meander through the town. Quite easy to get there by train from Shenzhen. It is worth a trip and the artists are quite pleasant - it is not one of those markets where you feel like you are getting scammed and ripped off."
238,Art for everyone!,The Oil Painting Village has a fascinating history which is still in display today despite all the modernisation processes from the government. Certainly a very interesting experience walking along the narrow streets and discovering some hidden gems!
239,Try to spare a couple of hours,"Whether you are looking for a reproduction of a famous painting (quality varies widely) or are looking to commission a painting yourself, this is definitely worth the time.  For as little as $20USD, one can walk away with a very nice quite large oil painting (original or copy).  One of the stranger things is seeing some of the huge printers in the back alleys printing ""paintings"" onto canvas (not the oil paintings).  Everyone was friendly and you can haggle on price and we found that bundling works well to drive prices down.  There were multiple individuals painting some AMAZING portraits of families from photographs, so if that is something you'd like done, you can negotiate a price and have them do it and they will mail it.  From a friend that lives in Shenzhen, I was told that they are reliable and trustworthy and it seemed that there were many paintings being sent around the world (as evidenced by packing materials we saw).  Interestingly, we were the ONLY non-locals in the ""village"" for the 3 hours we were there.  To visit get off at the Dafen stop and if you use google maps, the location is correct.  If you go down the steps from the elevated metro, you'll see a couple of signs pointing you towards the village.  It is about a 5 minute walk.  Aside from the shops selling painting and the individual studios, there isn't much to do, but there are several restaurants in the area."
240,"Art, Art, Art","I admit i am not a fan of fine arts, probably due to this we find this place not so interesting.This place not only sells painting, it also sell various painting product, including frames and other tools for painting as well.Anyway, this place was too quiet. We could hardly see any tourist, also hardly any artist plying their trade. And it was Saturday afternoon! I was expecting better crowd turn out to boost the atmosphere. Too empty and quiet. A stark contrast to the nearby Walmart which was quite packed.Dafen Art Museum was not open on that Saturday afternoon.Yeah, we did spot some artist doing paintings. Yupe, they were talented, but the problem is the place was quiet and nobody is watching the artist doing painting! What's the point of performing when there's no spectator. I hope he was just practicing.In the end, we end up spending more time at a nearby Walmart which was overwhelmingly crowded, a stark contrast to Dafen Painting Village.Probably we need to consult people on a better time to visit this place.Skip this place if your are not interested in arts and have no spare time in Shenzhen."
241,Dafen Oil Painting Village,"My wife and I have been here 3 times. On our first visit we bought many paintings at what seemed to be flat out bargain prices. I say at what seemed to be since framing back in the U.S. turned bargains into high costs for actual use. Their is a tremendous amount of art here at varying levels of quality. But mostly oil paintings and mostly mass produced. Some shops literally have thousands of paintings stacked up. There are also paintings on demand available. Give the painter a photo and get an oil painting. Some really good and some not so much. On subsequent visits we were really excited to start our day and get to Dafeng and find hidden gems. Our subsequent visits found our enthusiasm tempered. In the end there are few of any gems. True originality is lacking. The strong majority of the paintings have a hotel feel to them. We did enjoy a nice coffee shop on our second visit but going out to Dafeng is not practical for just coffee. Our first visit would have been a five. With each visit the experience falls. Go one time, enjoy yourself and keep it at that."
242,amazing selection in reproduction city,"We have been to Dafen Village perhaps a half dozen times over the years.  If you enjoy art, this is a don't miss experience.  We actually take our paintings from home to Dafen to have them framed - cost is around $25.00 versus $150.00 plus in the States.  We have had family portraits painted and framed.  We have bought replicas of great works of art as well as some originals and some commissioned pieces. We have used Shenzhen Fine Art for painting,framing, and shipping. 3F, Qing Xie Chang Complex, Hu Xi Road (West of Keyuan Community),website szfineart.com  Tel: 86755-8415-5272  We have left our accumulations of purchases from them and elsewhere many times and they have always done a great job shipping it all back..They are very helpful people and speak good English."
243,So much art!,"Nice for an afternoon looking around the sprawling alleyways full of artists, both creating original works and amazing replicas. Pick yourself up a very nice and cheap painting for around 50元, or bring a photograph and have one commissioned for around 300元+"
244,Immerse yourself in an artists world,"From Shangrila hotel at Fudian, it takes about 45mins to get there by taxi. And we spent a good 3 hours there, simply because we both appreciate art n my better half loves to paint.We saw artists painting n there were some award winning ones with paintings selling at rmb8k.Art supplies are really cheap here as compared to Hk or probably else where.  There is an art museum here too if you have time. Will be back again."
245,Did not get to see much,"There is a picturesque enclave in Shenzhen, China with lanes filled with colorful brushstrokes, artistic expression, and scents of drying paint.  It is easy to get dreamily lost here among the classic, impressionist, and abstract art that pours out of Dafen Village. Dafen village was started over twenty years ago by a group of artists specializing in creating replicas of well-known paintings by oil painting masters including Van Gogh, Vermeer, and Picasso.  The replicas were sold worldwide and slowly more artists moved in.  Currently, there are both original and reproductions for sale.  In addition, you can commission artists to recreate your favorite painting for a modest price.   If you get weary from feasting your eyes on the artwork, I suggest you stop into a cafe, restaurant, or trinket shop.  They are nestled in among the endless art galleries.  A foray to Dafen Village should not be missed.  You might even find yourself going back again and again to get a dose of art, creativity, and quasi-culture."
246,worth a visit,"For my was a really amazing surprise , my friends in Shenzhen recomended  several times to go there but always do not have time to go ...This time I went and the spend nearly 5 hours that were like five minutes... you cannot imagin how many painters there are there and each better than other.....you can ask any of them to make you a replica of any painting you want at incredible prices"
247,Interesting Experience,It was a pretty hot day but I am glad we visited there. My wife and I took time to check out the most of stores and bought 4 big beautiful paintings which costed us about 140 USD. Where can you can this kind of bargains now days!
248,Good if you're in the market to buy,"I spent a few hours wandering Dafen Art Village in January.  It was the week before Chinese New Year and I didn't realize that workers tend to take 2-3 weeks off.  About half the stalls were closed, but it was still totally worth it.  Hundreds of stalls with tons of art and most of it were not knockoffs.  Most of the stall owners were just chillin and didn't lift an eye when I walked in to browse.  Some stalls had super attentive workers that stood really close to you in an effort to be helpful, but usually made me quicken my pace out of there.  The neighborhood was mostly filled with Chinese nationals shopping for themselves, but there were a handful of foreigners like me too.  A couple tips:- Bring a translator.  Like elsewhere, no one really speaks english.- 2x2 paintings were going for ~$5 USD.  A 3x6 reproduction I liked was about $100.  A 3x6 original piece I still regret not buying was about $200 USD.  Haggling further is very possible, but super reasonable face prices."
249,To feel and smell modern Chinese art,"Thanks to a meeting, a short 2 day stay in Shenzhen (pronounced “shen- jer – en”) was on tap.Very much a city built up from Chinese success and close proximity to Hong Kong.For those who do not fly, Shenzhen is where the rest use the train, foot or ferry to travel in and out of Hong Kong from Mainland China.  When you read about the protests in Hong Kong, relating to escalating food prices, for example, they are found at this border.Shenzhen is part of the Pearl River Delta.  An area consisting of more than 40 million people.  The city holds a population of over 10 million of that huge amount of people.Unlike HK, a traveler is best served by knowing Chinese.  Apart from language, Shenzhen maintains the same look and feel of HK.The Shenzhen airport has a decor far more modern than all of the other airports in Asia.  Many curved lines, bright white and open spaces make up the style of this airport.  In typical Asian Airport efficiency, entering and departing the airport is quick and easy, the opposite of Western air travelOf the better known things to do in Shenzhen, a visit to the Da Fen Art Village is a must.  Based on the size of this area, anyone with artistic talents make their way here to earn a living cranking out reproductions of very famous works.  Mona Lisa, Monet, Picasso….you name it, a cheap, cheap reproduction can be had.Artists can be seen in every nook and cranny painting away.Once you reach The Da Fen Area, there are art options on either side of the street.  The most obvious, a 4 storey building. Enter from any one of the doorways and art hounds will be greeted by floor to ceiling artwork of many kind.  The ground floor seems to house mostly traditional Chinese Artwork and Calligraphy, hop the winding staircase in the center of the space, the second floor choices are equally overwhelming.After some strolling about, I was approached by one of the shopkeepers.  She was very nice and was not pushy, she recounted how her family owns 3 rooms in this show place and employ a group of artists, keeping them in full supply.  Having read about this area before hand, I asked her if she could tell me where the other shops were.  She said this was it…Armed with my new fact my only options were in this building I continued to look around and eventually found some pieces I liked.  The two 40cm x 40cm newly painted works cost a grand total of 20$.  They were still drying when I found them.  After paying, I was invited to drink some tea in their shop.  From here I was able to ask more questions.  Hearing and reading about the slowing economy in China (and worldwide), asking a business who would be greatly affected by economic swings seemed a good piece of anecdotal research; business had indeed been slowing.  Less walk in traffic was making its way to their shops. Fortunately for this operation, an online presence enabled worldwide sales.After softening them up with more pleasant chit chat, I asked again about other parts of Da Fen.  I suspect since I laid down some cash at her business, she felt more willing to give me the scoop on the rest of this area.  The shopkeeper proceeded to provide directions on where to head next.  She did take one last shot and dissuading me.  “It is all small shops, not one big building like us”.A quick jaunt across the street and there the official Da Fen Village, with sign and all.   The variety and sheer number of works found in the 2 storey showroom does not prepare for what was about to be seen.  The village consisted of  shops one after another and another and another, artwork spilling out into the streets.  Some shops displaying well known works, while others, to my pleasant surprise, featured unique works from young Chinese artists.  Seeing and experiencing how Creativity has been lacking from the general mindset, these artists provide proof, China simply needs more time.  Lack of imagination is simply an atrophied muscle needing therapy.The village was home to many environmental elements favourable to a pleasant visit.  Firstly, no one was trying the hard sell.  They allowed potential buyers to look without being bothered.  2)  Everything is up for negotiation.  In some instances, prices would be cut in half on the first hint a customer may be leaving their shop.  A large painting, 1m x 1.5 m had an initial price of 2000RMB (400$), but was instantly cut to 800RMB, without even a struggle.  3)  There are two wonderful coffee shops within the village.  Each providing very different environments.  Both with excellent Ice Cappuccino.Just as many like to trace the origins of their food, Da Fen Artists Village provided a glimpse to the starting point of many art pieces found in home decor stores in the west.  The area was not only responsible for the artwork but many framing options and supplies found in everyday stores.The Da Fen Artist Village is clearly a place where more than one day is needed to explore.  Visitors will see so much, any decision will be hard pressed.  While your choices will be difficult, rest assured the cheap prices will make it hard to feel your made a bad choice.Be sure to check out the Shenzhen Hotel Review at http://glassoscotch.wordpress.com"
250,Artist Village,"I enjoyed this pretty and art filled village, while we were there early so not everything was open it was lovely and amazing art to view"
251,A Quick trip to the Artists Village,Our visit to Dafen left me in awe at the talented artists who were at work and the amazing paintings they produced.  They made it look sooo easy!  This is a must visit place for anyone visiting Guangdong province
252,"For paintings, art supplies, day trip","A visit to Shenzhen would not be complete if you didn't visit Dafen, conveniently on the Shenzhen MTR System. It is home to the Oil Painting Village, an interesting group of old and some fairly modern buildings complete with a central square in its midst! One can see or buy reproductions or get your very own photos turned into oil painting after discussions/negotiations with the painter! Plenty around and lots of choices! If you don't intend to buy, you can soak in the ambience or visit the numerous galleries. We chanced upon an old traditional courtyard house located in the central plaza but beautifully restored and turned into a gallery. There is an admission fee but cheaper for seniors 65 and above, irregardless of citizenry! Adjacent to it are also 3 old houses, similarly restored! We had a great morning and afternoon there exploring the village."
253,Interesting setting!,"This place offers wide range of art on sale / commission. The quality is from abysmal to good. You can watch artists at work, buy art materials, have painting framed or just roam around and admire the works on display."
254,A trip to Da Fen Artist Village,"Dafen Oil Painting Village was a great surprise. We (4 thirty something year olds) set out to 'have a look' and burn up a few hours on a Sunday. It was the most enjoyable part of Shenzhen to explore. It's a small village, really friendly people. You can find the artists inside doing their thing (painting!).Hints:1) English is not great, but everyone was friendly and do try very hard to help2) Do bring Yuan - cash is king.3) Don't get things framed if you're going to get the MTR back to Shenzhen or back to Hong Kong - there are size limits on taking things back and there are security to stop you from trying.4) In my experience, Taxi's are not a great option at least to get back, so plan on taking the MTR back - it's much easier.5) Bargaining - you can ask for a little off. we managed ~12% off the price - but it's all relative. Would have been happy paying the asking price for a majority of items."
255,Unbelievable experience! ,cosy place. its sens out of time. typical chinese painters and so on. must do ifyou pass near  by. i spend a great afternoon there
256,Don't Forget to Bargain!,"The day I visited Dafen was to pick up a frame that I had ordered online. I went with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised of how quaint and genuine the place is. We went on a week day and it was nice and quiet, apparently it can get really busy on the weekends. It is chock full of little galleries, including the lane ways in between the blocks of shops, where you may find artists plying their trade. You really need a full day to appreciate all the art. I was only there for a couple of hours and felt I only scratched the surface. We found a cool little bohemian style cafe called zgxs art (bizarre name i know) to grab a coffee and recharge. Definitely worth a look."
257,Enjoyable trip for art lovers ,The area is an artist village for the production of replicas of masterworks and outsourcing of original art creation.Different types of work
258,You can't miss it!,"I could hardly believe the volume of art produced here. Some mass produced for business, others more personal, with a small developing area of more creative new artists appearing. Art supplies sold at very reasonable prices. Price range for those wishing for a souvenir to larger more expensive purchases. Some areas seemed to have lots of the same. Worth a day trip, and enjoy a coffee after in one of the new  designer cafes or walk a little further for a traditional meal."
259,Another visit to the painting village,"After living in HK for many years I've always wanted to visit Dafen. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of art and the friendliness of the artists/shop keepers. No one hassling or pressuring you to buy. Sure most of the stuff is very cheesy but there are some diamonds in the rough. Best place to have paintings copied, so if you see something on the internet that you like bring a photo and you will def find an artist who can replicate it at bargain prices."
260,Absolutely fascinating,"Dafen Oil Painting Village is a bit of a trek from the city center, but it's totally worth it. We loved it so much, we went back a second time just a few days later. I've decorated my home with many oil paintings that were purchased here. The area is cool, as are the shops. I recommend getting your bargaining gloves on, as the shops ARE willing to barter. Happy shopping!"
261,Lovely artistic area.,While Visiting Macau came across a life size portrait of a village at a halal eatery rom xinjiang province. The painting appears as a high vantage point that eliminates the foreground and most of the horizon depicted in the village background. Just Superb....!!!
262,Nice shopping,"Be sure when you get off the subway you walk to the left. If you've walked more than a few blocks and still don't see it, you are going the wrong way. I had a Chinese student try to be helpful and help me find my way, but rather than ""losing face"" and admitting she didn't know where to go, she just led me in the wrong direction! Anyway, it's a fascinating place. I agree with BoerInChina. Walk around first to see if you can get the best prices. Definitely a good Saturday activity! Note: it is not open very late (maybe 8pm?), so be sure to go during the day."
263,Interesting -organizing  the paintings would be very helpful,While one can find fault with the factory volumes of art produced one can only be amazed by the scope and quality. One can spend a few good hours walking around. If you are not tempted to buy something I would be amazed. I never fail to pick something up. Problem is that little refreshments are available. Never the less opposite to the main entrance is a Chinese restaurant where the food is outstanding and prices are very low compared to HK. Sorry no name as only Chinese characters but it is diagonally opposite the main entrance with a large statue of a paint brush.
264,Awesome Experience,I went to Dafen specifically to get a painting made. The Art on display is amazing and of a high quality. There is a lot going on and it is fascinating to see the artists sitting out on the street producing their work. I would have two tips to any other would-be visitors:- It was quite difficult to find - exit the Dafen subway station and turn right. Walk past shops including Walmart and it will be on your left.- I would strongly recommend that you bring a Mandarin phrasebook or are familiar with at least some basic phrases in Mandarin. I did not do this and was caught out as very few people there speak any English.
265,Interesting,"I can not wait to return to Dafen for a second visit because there simply is too much to see and absorb in just one visit.   I wandered through several streets and alleys and encountered an array of artwork created from a variety of materials.  The reproductions looked wonderful and the original works were great.  I bought 4 paintings (11"" x 14"") already framed for 160 RMB, or for less than $25 USD.  Do not miss an opportunity to participate in the Dafen art experience."
266,Art overload,"Visited Dafen during our stay in Schenzhen and enjoyed it so much went back a second time. Vast selection of original and copied art works in all styles and sizes. Several art supply shops selling artist's tools and materials at great prices. An interesting place to visit, even for those not artistically inclined. Rather think young children would not be too impressed.Easy to get to via the Metro. Line 3 (Blue) to Shuanglong, get off at Dafen, follow signs, cross over road on the bridge then follow road about 500m with rail track now on your right side on opposite side of road, past Walmart until you run out of payment, then go left into village. Quite easy actually. On return catch Line 3 towards Yitian."
267,Great souvenirs and hang out for beautiful day,"There are many beautiful, high-quality paintings, sculptures, and other works of art on display and for sale in the village. For sale are both originals and great reproductions."
268,Rows upon rows of small shops,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but it's not quaint and picturesque like the name suggests. Rather, you get quite a few blocks of storefronts, each with paintings, frames, some sculpture, and a few cafes. Great for a couple hour stroll or a purchase if you like reproduced painting or want to commission a personal painting at a decent price. The Dafen Art Museum is free and there were lots of interesting paintings inside. We took a taxi here and it was difficult to get a taxi back out to town, so plan ahead."
269,Excellent Area,"This village offers everything from copies of the masters to unique, original artworks across a range of styles. Find something you like or, take a photo of your favourite thing and have one of the artists recreate it it any style!"
270,Beautiful day trip,"For a westerner, this will definitely be an odd sight to see. It is far out from the city, about a 35-40 minute metro ride from Luohu. After browsing through various shops and navigating through narrow alleyways, I came upon a multi-story art showroom called Pix2Oils. Name a painting, they'll have a fresh-painted replica in stock or will commission an artist to paint one. Jolina, the sales manager, spoke English very well and we were able to order a custom framed painting, and have it shipped back to New York for less than just what the frame would have cost in NYC locally. Bring water! It gets hot and AC is virtually non-existant there."
271,Surprisingly fun,Dafen is a lovely hidden gem for anyone visiting Shenzhen. I say hidden but it is also conveniently located on the metro line. It just takes an hour to get there from the central futian area and longer from shekou. However the expense is minimal. It is worth the journey and even for someone who knows little of the fineries of art (like myself) this is an enjoyable peruse. There are beautiful canvases to observe but it is also great to watch the artists at work. Just be aware they dislike you taking pictures. There are some lovely rooftop cafes also where you can enjoy a coffee or beer and in our experiences the painting prices were not extortionate and most were open to haggling (a little Chinese may be needed). A perfect location to secure a souvenir or present!
272,Great way to enjoy peaceful day,"If you want to experience a genuine piece of Shenzhen that is off the usual path, be sure to set aside a few hours to walk through this large village that is tucked away in a corner of the city. To begin with, there is the curious, fascinating and hilarious/sad sight of seeing scores of artists painting copies of Van Gogh's Sunflowers, Starry Night, as well as his blossoming almond branch and several other iconic works. Some are very good; many will trick a passing gaze. They are sold to people who want an ""original"" oil painting with all of the requisite textures. And while Van Gogh is the star, you can expect to find some other well known works being painstakingly copied in alleys and the major byways of this authentic village where artists, starving and fed, also live. Expect to see families working together to produce their copious copies, with toddlers and infants close at hand (and considerably quiet). Besides the ""artists"" making copies, there are also giant copy machines which are printing copies of great works and otherwise on canvas. And there are scads of frame makers turning out frames on which to stretch the canvases as well as the over-priced frames we buy in the USA. Yes, many of the paintings and reproductions and frames on sale in stores such as HomeGoods, Target, etc. must surely hail from this industrious little village.BUT (and this is a big one), there are also genuine artists making their own original paintings and prints, and some of them are quite fine and well-worth the modest price many of them ask. They are certainly in the minority and for every one of them there must be 20 who are dutifully making copies, but if you take your time, you are bound to find some very gifted artists who are usually as humble and pleasant as they are talented.  Much of the manufactured art (that is not copies of masterpieces) is garish, but it is all fun, and I don't begrudge any of them their taste or their means of making a living.Also on hand are many artist supply shops, which offer amazingly good deals on well-made brushes, paints, etc. Not only is the village picturesque and photogenic, but it is also a treat to the sense of smell with a mixture of smells from oil paint and freshly cut wood wafting through the air."
273,A wonderful day amongst artist!,"Shenzhen has several art communities and creative spaces, but the most popular and well known one is undoubtedly Dafen Oil Painting Village in Longgang District. In a bustling city like Shenzhen it can sometimes be hard to know where to go during a day off, especially if you don’t fancy a hike or park that day (probably the two most popular things to do during free time). Dafen Oil Painting Village provides the opportunity to have a nice walk, get some fresh air and soak in some culture at the same time.Walking around here you can see virtually every type of painting style from abstract to impressionism and all the ones in between. Many of these are in small studios which you can browse around in and look at the art undisturbed by the owner. Some of the art is done in the little alleys between buildings, where the artists are in their zone, focused on a picture from an iPad, making a flawless reproduction or two. You can stand and watch as magic happens in front of youDafen metro station exit A1"
274,Very Interesting place,"We took the metro from Shenzhen and didn't appreciate how long it would take, around 1.5 hours! It's not really a village but an array of streets behind Walmart, it's not signposted so we had to ask directions. Massive amount of art on sale, lots that you would recognise."
275,"Interesting place, great for a bargain!","If you're a owner/buyer/renovator of a restaurant/pub/club/hotel looking for an artpiece to install/hang on in your establishment. This is the place to go. Get all your bulk discounts, of Da Vinci's Sunflower or the Screamer. When I visited, there is literally a woman drawing multiple copies of the Sunflower. It's as good as any Sunflower for the ""non-art"" people like me. Plus, she has lots of practice I guess. An interesting idea is you can bring your own picture and find a willing artist there to draw you in a pose of the Spanish Conquistador or a Middle Age King or an Emperor carrying an iPhone in your hand, as opposed to a sword or something. Because that's exactly what I saw one guy was doing, he was getting ready to bring the portrait home to hang up.There is an art museum in the middle of the area worth visiting, where the pieces are more curated. They have permanent and event displays. It was free entry when I went."
276,buying art,DaFen Oil Painting VillageTake Metro to DaFenThe walk to Dafen Oil Painting Village is about 5minutes.Many shops big and small selling paintings. Many are copies of famous works though there are some originals ... mostly abstract art. There are shops selling art materials also. Tip:Take a walk around the village and look at the many shops before choosing your favourite. Many artists copying the same famous work so standards vary. Nearest toilet is at the mall next to the Metro. Prices start from RMB40 onwards.
277,Worth the trip!,"I stopped on the way to a business meeting and wished I had given myself a lot more time. No, not a lot of originality but certainly a lot of talent. Met a nice young couple who were happy to paint some of my landscape photos.  definitely worth a stop."
278,Deep inside look into the paint and copy world,"We took the Shenzhen Metro to Dafen and were bemused to follow the directions we had been given - go beyond Walmart and turn left. In the alleyways there are artists painting everything from fantastic copies of classic calligraphy to paint by number classics. Most of the material being produced, to be honest, is bound for motel bedrooms of the world, but there are some magnificent landscapes, and if you want frames and painting materials this is the place to come. We thoroughly enjoyed an hour or so here, and then went around the corner to the art gallery which was an absolute delight, and really did make the point that art is not about copying someone else. And so back to the metro."
279,Get your very own copy of your favourite painting by your favourite master!,"Classic chinese industry - this village (a small neighborhood within Shenzhen) - is composed of 5-10 streets, each with shops that do nothing but sell oil paintings. They range from amateur to very talented, but with a good 50% on the very talented side. While originally known for copies of the great Masters, now you see a lot of originals. The copies are really not so good, colors not exact. However, the originals (or copies of unknown works :)) are very good. And many of the artists take commissions.Its good to see the artists actually working on a painting - iPad next to them so they can see the work they are copying. Some of the artists excel at photo-realism. This is worth 2-3 hours. If it wasn't that there were sooo many paintings, you would think you were in an art museum."
280,Lots of paintings,"Visited on recommendation of a friend during a recent early  morning.I enjoyed seeing the artist working during the early morning hours ( 10.00am)Restricted by the size of my suit case I bought a small print from one of the shops that were open early. Something that would help all of the shop owners who are just retail shops and "" likely "" not the artist would be to organize the prints by  theme or type. City-scapes should be separated from the portraits, etc. That would make shopping much easier and likely increase sales."
281,Dafen Oil Painting Village for the window shopper,"The Painting Village is accessible by taxi.  Expect to pay about 50 RMB from the Futian district---about half hour ride,There are seemingly hundreds of artist showrooms lining the pedestrian walkways.  Just about every style imaginable.  We didn't buy anything, but it is my understanding that they will reliably ship items to your home.  Note, there are a few streets with artisans who make frames, should you wish to have one made for your work of art purchase.This is where the locals come for their art.  It is a very enjoyable way to spend time even if you don't buy.Note, there is an Art Museum adjacent to the village."
282,I spent way too much money,"I loved visiting this Dafen Oil Painting village. By subway from Ocean World it took about an hour and a half to get there. Exit the subway at the Dafen exit and walk towards Walmart, then continue walking past Walmart and a little further you turn left and walk into the village. There are rows and rows of different artist booths and stalls. All of the paintings are very cheap. You can barter a little, especially for the bigger paintings, but they are already so cheap that I didn't barter at all. I bought this 16X20 painting of a sunset for only $5 USD. It's fun for all art lovers, there are many famous paintings with fun twists and variations by the artists. It's also a cheap place to buy paint brushes and supplies. A tube of oil paint will cost you about .75 cents for a small tube and $1.50 for a bigger one."
283,Get some art,"This was a very big surprise the first time we visited. It was not what we expected at all. It is street after styreet of artists and galleries where every painting you can think of is copied and available to buy. If there is a certain picture you want a copy of and you can't find it there, you just need to provide the ddetails to one of the artists and they will paint it for you. Even make a painting form a photograph if thats what you want. Oil, water, ceramics everything is done there.All the artists we watched painting and galleries we visited were very receptive and not pushy like the vendors at the fake markets. Prices were resonable form the start but there is still room to haggle if thats your thing and always a discount for multiple buys. Some of the oils on canvas are fantastic regardless of what your preference is. Modern, classic, countryside, city, spaceage..... all are there and great value.Easily accessable form the main road and off the subway, although from Shekou it about an hour or so each way.If you have a day or even half a day free it is one of the places you should visit is in the Shenzhen area. Especially if you have access to the metro."
284,A Fascinating Artist's Villiage,"We took a Didi from SheKou and took us about almost an hour to reach the destination. The journey back by subway took us 1hr 20min. Easy to access nevertheless by subway. There are many lanes of art street with artists painting indoors and outdoors. Some are water coloured , acrylic or oil based. After a while we start to be able to differentiate how “fake” some paintings were due to the colours used. If u plan to get a painting here, must know what exactly u are looking for, because the range is huge and quality varies."
285,Just go...,"I have visited Dafen twice, and on both occasions found it to be a wonderfully bizarre experience. The people are friendly and are eager to showcase their art from within the bounds of impressive glass-structured studios, to far more humble studios under stairways and alleyways. Make sure that you have time to fully enjoy the experience of the Dafen Painting Village. Make an effort to go into as many galleries as possible. The majority of the work is reproductions, but every so often you happen on some original art. Between the grey buildings are interspersed far older buildings that resemble shrines and old tea houses, but now are home to some extraordinary art work. Many artists are willing to haggle for a lower price, but the art is sometimes so reasonably priced that it seems almost criminal to get it any cheaper. Whilst there, look out for the dim sum ladies who are normally positioned at the top of the streets. Enjoy a steamed pork bun, which stands in stark contrast to the sweet BBQ pork bun that you’ll find across the border in Hong Kong. They are very cheap; going for about 1 yuan a bun. Take some time to chill out, have a bun and marvel at the enormity of Dafen."
286,A GREAT place to shop,The place was really interesting and surreal. I totally didn't expect to find a village like this at all when I was in Shenzhen. The paintings are incredible and I wished that I bought an oil painting or watercolour to hang up in my flat in London but the suitcase and long-haul flight definitely will not permit this from occurring.I don't remember any toilets around apart from those at the Dafen Art Museum so make sure you find toilets or go before you come here.The Dafen Art Museum is worth a visit.It was awesome seeing some artists do their work as well.
287,nice day out,The reason for an unusual poor review is because my day was a washout and I  can only base it on that.  Most of the shops were closed sadly. And the shopkeepers of some are temperamental. Many positives however.  Great buildings and statues.  The art work I did see was of a high quality. Easy to find from the metro. Would be great on a summers day and I intend to return when it is that.
288,Really interesting way to spend an afternoon,"Absolutely loved our visit to Dafen.  Although the day was hot and humid we spent a good couple of hours there just walking around.  Very interesting to watch paintings in production, as well as the brush sellers, framers etc.  Lots of little galleries to pop in to as well.  We saw artists producing original works rather than those doing reproductions.  Very very cheap to buy framed paintings as well.  Transport could be an issue - we went by taxi but had a lot of difficulty getting a taxi to go back to the hotel."
289,Amazing collection of art and artist,"The place was easy to find: take the train to Dafen station on the Longgang Line, and take exit A2. You will see a Wal-mart in the distance and walk in that direction. When you pass by a small Gong-Cha booth, you will see a sign pointing to the village on your left. My family and I went on a Monday and there wasn't any crowds for us to follow. Hence I think it might be better if you visit on a weekend instead. Most shops open about noon so it was pretty quiet when we were there. I was amazed by the number of shops and artists and affordable art pieces. I'm not a arty person myself but I ended up buying a small art piece myself. It was a hot day and hence tiring to walk around the area. I also regret not visiting the art museum near by as well.I would advise any visitors to set aside 2-3 hours for this place, and not to hesitate if you see an art piece that you like. The human memory can be frail at times and sometimes you recall that there was an art piece that you like but you may not be able to find your way back in the myriads of shops there."
290,Loved every minute of it,"This place is quite a drive from the main Shenzhen city centre. The village is created on the concept of clustering. There are a huge number of shops just selling different types of paintings. A few on the side which sell the basic raw materials for supporting the ""industry"". You'll see people sitting on the side and copying various paintings of various masters, from any genre. I did come across a couple of folks who sell their originals, and it's quite apparent that they are not in the mass production business. You can get your portrait painted for posterity from a favourite photo of yours.Add I said, it's not really a tourist destination, but useful for a businessperson sourcing paintings."
291,Good experience,"Not the kind of place you would expect to find in such a modern and bustling place as Shenzhen, but it was indeed a nice surprise. Of course, very few paintings were worth buying, but you can find good art material for extremely cheap prices, and the houses around are a nice add to the most modern buildings on the outskirt."
292,Arts village,The smell of oil paint hangs heavy in the air.  Full of all types of all types of painting from kitsch to artful copies to original clever works.  The gallery is well worth visiting but has odd opening hours and has periods of being closed.
293,Very cool the first time,"We took a taxi from Louhu railway to Dafen, 30-ish RMB and 15 mins later - we discovered DAFEN Artists District. It is a super interesting place to visit if you like art. Very soho/bohemian like. We ended up purchasing 2 paintings which were swiftly wrapped up for us. Whilst we had been to SZ 5 times, this was the first visit to DAFEN and it will not be our last. There are cafes to stop for a coffee, narrow alley ways to explore and very cool things to see whether you appreciate art or not - it is a wonderful experience. I would definitely recommend it for a visit and at least 2-3 hours should be allowed. The only issue we had was getting a taxi afterwards so I would recommend catching a train or otherwise allow plenty of time to find a taxi. The art we purchased is significantly cheaper than what we would have paid in Australia for a similar piece."
294,Take your time...,Excellent artists in a variety of mediumsCovers 4 city blocksDefinitely worth goingSuggest spring or autumn to go there
295,Such a cool place to visit for an afternoon!,"Dafen Oil Painting Village (Dafen Village), one of Shenzhen's famous attractions, was originally one of many Hakka villages in Shenzhen and has now developed into the world's largest oil production and export base.Most of the houses in the oil painting village are converted from village houses in the city. The exterior walls are filled with various paintings and graffiti. There are also some artistic sculptures on both sides of the road. The oil paintings and picture frames are randomly placed along the street. Adds an artistic touch."
296,Dafen little world,"Getting there (location): Take the metro to Dafen. Dafen metro station is about 15mins from Laojie metro station. Then exit A and walk past the Walmart on your left. It will be a left turn into a street with a signpost saying Oil Painting Street. The walk to the village from Dafen metro is probably 5mins, i think probably about 300 metres.Don't go too early. I was there at 12 noon Wednesday and most of the shops were still just opening. I walked around and had some tea break at the Oil Painting Gallery Coffee Bar or something like that. It's on the 2nd floor overlooking the carpark. Coffee was nice there and there's a sign that said they provide free wifi. Their toilets are clean too. They serve sandwiches, toasts, cafe stuff. By 2pm, most of the shops were open and more painters can be seen doing their work. I think 3pm is a good time to go. None of the painters/owners mind when i asked whether i could take some pictures of their works or their galleries. There are also dozens and dozens of framing shops. They can deliver as well after framing your pictures. Artworks there consists of modern, classical, animals, landscapes, pop art, etc. Almost everything is there.There are a few art supplies shops around there which i see some of the artists get their supplies from. I bought some acrylic paint and some knives and brushes. Those 2-3in brushes costs like 2-3yuan ea. 500ml acrylic paint was 29yuan. A basic set of 5 knives was 35yuan. But there was another shop that sold the knives separately at 20-30yuan ea, probably the better quality ones. I don't know about knives. They sell all kinds of brushes, palettes, those painting apron thingies, canvas, easels, oils, acrylics, etc. I tried to bargain with 1 shop where i bought the knives, but she said it was fixed price, and pointed out that the previous guy in front of me (who was an artist at the village) also paid fixed price without asking. The other shop said discount can only be given for min spending of 800rmb and above.All in all, it's a nice place to relax and slow down. Just walk and appreciate the art and the talent. See how they paint and their techniques. Most of them just print out and paint over but you won't know it looking at the finish product. Have some coffee and relax. 2-3 hours should be sufficient. I really enjoyed this place. Inspires you to paint!"
297,Very interesting and a great day out!,"Apparently, Dafen supplied 60% of the world's copies of famour oil paintings, although this has changed in recent years.It was the last place on our list of places to see so we arrived in the evening: everything was dark and we had a problem finding it. Finally we walked down the street from the Wal-Mart and finally asked a girl that spoke English. She told us to go down a dark stairway. I thought she misunderstood us but she repeated her directions and we complied. At the bottom of the stairs we found a canal and on one side were stores selling prints of various styles and artists. I don't know if we saw the village in its entirety but it was an experience, to say the least.Alas, we did not buy a painting that night, but the prices were reasonable - we later bought a copy of Starry Night and a Hong Kong skyline (trite I know) for about $12 USD each! These were rolled up and I just stretched them on frames a few days ago. Definitley worth seeing and buying your own Van Gogh (or Monet, etc.) - your paintings at home probably came from here."
298,Worth the trip…easy subway ride,"Take the metro to Dafen Artist Village via Longing Line 3 (blue) toward suanlong and alight at Mu Mian Wan Station. Take exit B2 and walk 750m towards Walmart. Nice gallery and fantastic art work available at very reasonable prices. Bought very nice authentic frames at a steal. If you are not into art, it may bore you."
299,Interesting place if visiting Schenzen,"Dafen is in the southern part of the Longgang District in Shenzhen. The village is easily accessible by bus and metro (Look on the sing for the correct exit). One you leave the metro, head down the stairs on the right and  you will pass Walmart on your left, when you cross over the alley, ahead there will be a small staircase you go down and veer left. You will be able to see some shops in your distance. The area is set up like a grib so you can walk up and down and through the whole place. Inside you will find shops with knick-knacks, paintings of all prices, framed or non-framed, coffee shops and other small shops. Its a great place if you want to buy something unique or if you just want to walk around a cozy area on a sunny afternoon. Highly recommended if you visit Shenzhen."
