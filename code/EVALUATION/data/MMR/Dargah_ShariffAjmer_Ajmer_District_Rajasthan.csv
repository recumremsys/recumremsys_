0,Over rated place not for hindu,It's overrated place .. so many buggers inside and outside .. always demand money ..I don't understand why hindu visit this place ..
1,"Khawaja Garib Namaz Dargah, Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chisti ( R.A.)",Very poor experience... every corner there is someone begging aka demanding money in a so called holy place. Disgusting to say the least that officials have no rules in place.
2,Theives,It's a great holly place...but too much crowded particularly on Saturday....lot of options are there for shopping.
3,Worth the efforts,Visited because it was in my bucket list..a very sacred place...I wish they maintain cleanliness and especially the approach road was c so crowdef..need to be careful if you have chosen along with you.not as commercialized as other places but needs to manage huge crowd.
4,"Difficult to get to, worth the effort",Must visit... very peaceful and relaxes the body... be careful of beggars and others who will ask for for every small thing...
5,Dargah Sharif ajmer,Dargah is good .But the people out side shops are really a thief .They refuse customer and doeanot talk properly to customer.I really feel very bad to see all this .
6,Not Islam!,"Like any town famous for religious pilgrimage,  Ajmer is crowded...and it gets more so as one approches the Dargah Sharif.  Car parking can be found about a kilometre away from the Dargah. Rickshaws ply to and fro from there to about less than half a km from the shrine.   From…"
7,A belief and An institution,"Beautiful dargah, peaceful place to go and pray .. all religious denomination people come here. if u are tourist ..  PLEASE NOTE -- Once inside lots of people try to con you to take you to people with registers and extract money from you. DONT GO TO THESE FOLKS, GO TO THE MAIN…"
8,Beautiful and peaceful,Not sure what to say or write.. absolutely shocked...no words...at every step you feel like entering a slaughter house where you are just a bakra (Goat) for shopkeepers...and unfortunately dargah is the end point...from door of the shrine till you came out of it no one will spare you on the name of Allah...they just want money...no one was allowed to drop money in donation box and everyone was threatening you on the name of Allah...Then I next visited Gurudwara (temple for Sikhs)...I realised that it is not a place where even Allah is staying but just a marketing propaganda to screw innocent tourists in the name of religion..Better stay away...
9,Horrible experience,"What can I say about this place..It has a very different energy, I mean nice vibes. The holy shrine is located in a very busy market area where you can find a lot of eating and shopping options. There are more than 8 gates which lead to the dargah but not all are open to the public entrance. A must visit for everyone, irrespective of which religion you follow!Thanks!!"
10,Review,"Once upon a time Khwaja rested here...but now it's polluted...polluted place and minds. You will find people tying threads and asking for money, covering your head with some silk cloth and asking for money...and there are groups. Looks like Puri Dham 25 years back. Each group…"
11,BEAUTIFUL ,"People of all religions go there.Its not a tourist spot, its a place of faith. Go there expecting that.Dress conservatively"
12,Very crowded place full of thugs,"This place is full of theives. So called terrorist scum bags. I recomend pleople not to go there. All the shopkeeper ,beggers, parking are joint venture of thieves."
13,Soul soothing place but very crowded,One of the best place always to visit you  You get peace mentally & you get every thing in kwaja's darbar
14,A place of worship and faith,Its really an amazing place. I have visited ever. Crowded but best holy place to visit peoples of all religion. I love to visit again.
15,Sufi Saint Dargah,The dargah is surrounded in a crowded place and it's difficult to find parking near by. By it's worth the effects to visit the place. Also it's surrounded by alot of shops serving some delicious non veg food and sweets.
16,this became a business area now with only middle man involved,Everything was good as per my experience but people are there thay are not good they always asked for Money on different ways.
17,Inside the crowd and mess- Dargah stays peaceful and calm,The path leading to this place is very narrow and dirty. parking is another issue. Very crowded. Requires special faith to visit.
18,calming  dargah,Its so cool.. please visit bravia and enjoy the bar.Best for family party also.Staff also good as well as bar manager mr. karan is very nice.
19,Peaceful,I visited in month of number.. Awesome experience.. If u want to visit I have one suggestion please arrive early in morning till 6 am for avoiding rush
20,Must visit but with some prior know how.,"Dargah Sharif is approximately kwaja __do not know full name. Sorry. This is a very best praying place by darshan & ask with heart, Definitely your's asked you will get it. So many visitors everyday visit here. Eventhough Actors & Actresses, Minister come here. Industrialist also come here for prayers. Really it is a miracle Dargah. Guide must be needed for long time Darshan & know about history. Private car parking is also available. Thanks with regards."
21,Great place could be kept that way !,ajmer dargah is totally under khadims aka cheaters hand they are liars never ever get into their trap as soon you enter the dargah with flowers and chaddar the khadim will be behind you like a stalker they will follow you everywhere around dargah they will ask you to go with them and they will take you to another khadim he will pray for you and in return he will ask money and the guy who brought devotees will get commission even the dargah committee people are involved in this they wont let you worship unless and until you are paid devotee believe me they are very clever they hide the donation box with chaddar and they will ask you put money on chaddar and the most disgusting part is the chaddar you offer to kgn is also sold by khadim to the shop in half of the price they dont have manners they dont know how to talk  when you argue with them and the langar money is also under khadim control they buy it for 1 crore inr from the trustee and they enjoy the full profit of langar even the food which is cooked from langar is sold for 5 to 10rs   shame right ? even this thing include commission the khadim will appoint a man and he will have plastic bags with him and when you enter the get food they'll say its over but if you pay this man 5 or 10 rs he will get you food like seriously are we that dumb ? i am done with this thing like i feel why they are looting us in the name of god i must say if you are going ajmer dargah make sure you dont waste your money on langar or to the dirty khadims instead donate it for a good cause they will try to captivate you but dont get into their traps
22,"Visit to Khawja Gareeb Nawaz, Ajmer",It's a heaven place on Aimer. Feel so blessed to come here. Spent maximum time at Dargah Sharif. Great...
23,Very pious place,hi frnds its a very good place for the Relaxation  its a indian Haven its pride Of India India Known by hes name (mere Khwaja Ka Hindustan) Really It was Amazing Guys Whatever You Want Just Ask Once At Bargahe Moin ( Dargah Sharif of Ajmer ) i belive u r never gone retern…
24,Shirne of sufi saint,Today we are visit that place the name of Suffi dargaha with my friends..That is a amazing place so many crowd and everyone for dargaha staff saying money that is big issue
25,Just to see as an attraction,This place is very religious. You should park your cars proper area before the gate. Parking fees are high. Too many peoples will pretend as your guide don't be confused and ignore them. The lassi is good beside the food stalls and dry foods are cheaper than other places.
26,Early morning visit,A historical place on the land of rajasthan .. quiet good place with very good ambience .  A must see place once .
27,nice,"This is a very good place, people come from far away, here only a two-and-a half-day hut is situated at a distance.."
28,Yes of course but,"A spiritual place for alot of people of varying religions, be careful of the beggars as they are a dime a dozen so to say and they dont stop. If you choose to visit go when the sun is not at its peak.Overall 5/10"
29,Visit to the Dargha Shariff,"This place is full of thugs and you surely get looted here. There are many people who will say come here and eventually almost extract money from you. Also the place is very very crowded all the time and there are many pick pocketers roaming around. From our group, 2 people lost…"
30,Must Visit?!!,Very crowded no management and khadim people demand a money and if you pay so easy going to dargah sharif but if you not paid money so very bed behave by khadim people.
31,Devotion by people of all faith,"Not easy to negotiate all the people. Pushed and shoved. So over crowded and everyone wants your money.  Lined up for 30 minutes to get in, amid I guess 100 people all pushing you out of the way and jumping the queue. The old ladies were the worst, thumping me on the back with their fists and pushing me sideways.  So unpleasant. Once inside everyone wanted money from us. Gave a $5 donation to the first one then was ushered through very quickly without really seeing anything.  Being a westerner and unwilling to part with any more money we weren't wanted there.  Nothing much to see in the very small shrine, just a glance at the sufi. Very beautiful flowers decorating the outside of the shrine though.An unpleasant experience and probably not worth the wait."
32,A soothing place for inert peace,One is blessed to visit the Dargah of the renoknwed Sufi..Couple of suggestions before one is planning a visit. the walk up to the shrine is congested and very dirty..The beggars harasses you thought out and one needs to be very careful for pickpockets. I would recommend to ask…
33,Holy Place but...,A very calm and spiritual place...I visit this dargah almost every year and I feel this place has given me strength and peace everytime.It is only because of this dargah I go to Ajmer.
34,Busy & Very Chaotic,A Religious place of great importance to Muslims all over the world ....A tomb of Sufi saint Moinuddin Chisti also known as Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz (KGN )
35,Monica and Pushpendu Mukherjee ,well this place has something has spiritual powers >sorry to say the place is very dirty and seems like that nobody cares could see dirt everywhere around > the person who took care of us was genuine and gave us the right advise .and also in no time we were able to visit the dargah
36,Ajmer Sharif dargah,"Extremely filthy place with unclean infrastructure.I have read about Islam that people must not worship other than God (Allah), here it seems people are worshiping khwaja."
37,Kwaja ka darbar,"Visiting as spritual journey there, everything qas good and really like the ambiance and sukoo.what we get there is amazing."
38,Ajmer sharif,"This is a holy place. Many people believe everything we want, we get it here. The place is also very crowded."
39,Ajmer Dargah,"No one can rate this place as it is God’s house n when you get a chance to visit such places you feel blessed. We had a very nice Darshan as it was not that crowded and people we met were also nice, so we were happy."
40,Holy Dargah but crowded place!,"Very peace full religious place, has ancient and recent stories attached to the people who had their wishes answered in this Darbar."
41,Spiritual darshan,always good to visit Mazaars and mosque whilst on holiday. spend half and hour there. facilities for ladies as well.
42,Very crowded,"If you avoid the beggars, the people who unnecessarily surround you to help etc...... The place truly has a great charm. You feel nice. The devotion that the dargah gets is so overwhelming........Do visit but beware of pickpockets and beggars...."
43,Holy Place,I'm visit with my family and two children.. My Dargah Trip Is Successfuly and my life great trip.  My life Memorable Trip To Khawaja Sahab Dargah..  Ek nazar rehmat kids hum par bhi Kar dijiye mere khawaja...  Mera Khawaja Baadshah Hai Mujhe Koi Gum Nahi... 
44,Divine Experince,this place is very huge crowded throughout the year.very spiritual place.we can see a long que of beggars while going inside the dargah sharif.
45,One of the most spritual experiences ever!,It is the most sacred place in town. Every year visited by thousands of peopke from all relegions. I usually go their with friends and out family guests. The shrone is open all the tome and has lot of actovity goingit on round the clock. It has relegious beleif as well as best…
46,Beautiful,this place is nearly 2 km from ajmer railway station ..here akbar and his queen also came here..this place is for all people and all religion but this is very crowded place ..so u have to go by walking ..
47,Feared for my life,"Hi, This is too crowded place to see a dargah and path/roads are too crowded. You need to walk with great difficulty. After you go inside there priests who can take you inside and explain the place."
48,nice,"Religious places  all over the world have few characteristics. And if they are famous definitely one will observe the same, Dargah Shariff Ajmer is no difference.  1) For obvious reasons they will be crowded, very crowded 2) All kinds of chaos you can expect there 3) Businessmen…"
49,"Tips for Ajmer Sharif Dargah, Ajmer",One can find huge crowds at everytime of the year. Beware of pickpockets. Otherwise the place is very peaceful and relaxing.
50,Very Money minded place around and inside,It was a great trip of Ajmer. But it was one of the must visit place. Too much crowded because people's of all religions came here.
51,Greedy ,"Had terrible experience on 15.10.2018 evening visit.  Given the historical importance of this Darghah and tag of world famous place, I was eager to visit the place.  I had awful experience. Visited the place with family. A muslim priest ( Khadim) approached and wanted to help in getting visit properly for 100 bucks. I said fine. He warned me of mobile and purse, I kept my purse on front pocket & had nothing much to do abut mobile except being alert and holding tightly. We followed him for the main Dargah and another guy joined him. They kept looking  guiding me.  When we approached the dargah it was completely messed up with crowed from all sised. He forced us to enter the crowd and asked to stand in one corner and asked us to pray Allaha and ask for something, we stayed there for 1 minute and moved away he guided us to come towards other side of the Dargah while moving I realized my cell phone was gone. I immediately checked all my reamaining valuables and asked my wife to check her phone and other stuff. I too her phone to call my number it rang for 3 times and then went off. I left the premises hoping to save what ever is left.  Shocked and  disappointed moving out of Dargah. The  guy who was helping me joined and started  reminding me that he alerted me.  Not left with anyother option I wanted to give a police compliant asked him to guide me to police stations. I went to Ajmer Police station for the complaint was surprised to see 4 people ( 3 female and 1 male) already crying in tears in police station as they have been robed off their smart phone and all the money they had for the trip. I gave the complaint and asked the cops that this seems to be an organized crime. I was alert still someone took away the phone and there are many others. Not much response from them. I think we understand how this works. Sad and dejected not that I lost my expensive smart phone, more as1. A place  where people come from around the world is surrounded by organized criminals. 2. Police is in-effective. 3. No crowd management inside the main Dargah4. No management If you want to tour the place, can give complete miss as it's not safe and there are antisocial elements active and no security to control them.  If you have religious aspect can avoid entering main dargah as this is place where all wrong things can happen due to unman aged crowd."
52,Great Place With Huge Crowd,"It even gives you the glimps to visit that place again, a Sufi atmosphere again and again attracts to visit. Roads are quite narrow so walking might be quite difficult for many peoples."
53,Religious Place,Nice and holy place to visit. A place loved and visited by all religion believer. Thanks to my friend Mr. Maruf Chishti for his escort and support during my visit at Dargah Shareef
54,Wonderful experience,The dargah by itself is very crowded.  The area adjoining and outside is also very crowded and messy to an extent.  You have to careful of pick pockets.
55,Nice,Spiritual place Beware of pick pockets! In my opinion don't carry any belongings at all!This is experience talking!
56,Religious place,the place is really very very powerfull give a amazing positive vibe its a dargah of muslim but we can seen every religion people visit the dargha really great.
57,Awesome ,Been to  Dargah Sarif on 22 Oct 2018. What a place 😑. Felt very close to the Asia's First Dargah Sarif. Found that almost 90% were non-muslim. Very ancient (800) years of history.
58,Dargah shariff,This Dargah is a hisoticalplace. The approach to this place is in mich cowered area and very narrow street with much crowded by visitors and road side shops. One can visit at least once
59,Holy place ,Access to this place is very narrow and crowded. Private vehicles have to be left at far place and you have to take an auto to reach the place.Too much crowd near the place and there in no proper arrangement for queue/ line. Beware of thieves. Do not wear any valubles/…
60,Lucky and blessed to visit Dargah of Sarkar,In the january month I visited dargah sharif.Many tourist come here.it is very histercial place and knowledge
61,Dargah Shariff - AJMER - TRULY DIVINE,"Very nice place to visit. Its one of the most religious place for Muslims but mostly all communities visit there. Tourists , celebrities etc. People say if someone has a wish to fulfill, go and visit Dargah shariff . Put  ‘Chadar’ ( the holy cloth) and some flowers and wish…"
62,Great Place,Its a great place one time experience for other religions. Its crowded but suggest going with a guide so you can how to get around.
63,Great visit,"Beautiful and attractive Dargah, visited here with my friends.really Nice and attractive place. Feel good here."
64,Soulful place,Beautiful Vibes. People says all your wishes are fulfilled when you come here and ask with a pure heart. Must visit.
65,Peace,Good place to visit garib Nawaz. Approach to shrine congested and dirty. Touts harass u. Visited Pushkar temple also. Nice but small temple
66,"I have no words tell when I am here,","Dargah is a holy place every region people come ,wish and pray. It's holy place and crowded all the time. For some people hygiene might be issue"
67,Money matters at Gharib Nawaz,"Holy place and must visit. We parked our vehicle at Ganj area parking with 100rs charges. From there auto wala charged 200rs to and fro amount for taking us to main gate. We preferred going via auto, they took us through small galis. After reaching main gate people nearby will sorround you and start asking to buy chadar etc.Depending on  wish one can buy chadar. We bought chadar of 200rs and flowers of 100rs. After that be in the lane and from that point onwards people will literally force you and ask for money at every point. Dont panic and just politely ignore.Don't give any money to those guys. Donate to the board with proper receipt if you wish to in the dargah itself for betterment."
68,DIVINE,Had a wonderful experience there!! Got inner peace of mind here and I am sure you will also get!!Here every wish come true!! Must visit!!
69,Overcrowded and feel miserable,Okay to go. This is in remembrance of Sufi sant and people tonne there to get their from god. You should cover your head. 
70,Dont go,"We visited the Dargah Shariff on 21.Nov. ,17. The place attracts people’s from all over the world. The place as a kind of charisma in it. People’s do come out here with lots of wishes. If you’re are planning to visit this place, prepare yourself to face beggars, agents and many more...The best way to avoid them is don’t talk to them and avoid eye contact with them. Don’t argue with them."
71,100% ,I have visited this Dargah multiple times and always I had amazing and diving experience! Though u need to beware from Khadim from fleecing you!! Just take chadar/flowers own ur own and go inside!!very peaceful place to pray!! And if u have faith ur all wishes come true for sure!! U will not be disappointed!!
72,Must Visit.,People of all religions visit this place.Be extremely careful about pick pocketing.Avoid Khadims as they demand exorbitant amount.Avoid during Friday due to extra rush.Non Muslims to cover their head with piece of Cloth.
73,Reaching to Divinity ... Dargah Shareef,A belief system in the people and the faith put on the same makes lakhs of persons flock to this place for darshan and also to mark their presence by having a wish attached. The road leading to the Dargah have several shops lined up to make to buy offerings a different ranges. A…
74,Not a great experience,I visit regular to this place and it is world  only Sufi mosque. It is visited by many people everyone throughout the year. There is it's fair every year and visited by thousands every year. I m visiting many times with friends family and other friends. It is very big and very…
75,Connect to god and listen to nice qawali.,Nice to witness another spiritual side of India. come with long pants and head cover. Cameras in the bag
76,Money money money money,So crowded and so many people trying to extort money from you for the whole time you are there.I felt so miserable at telling people 'no' all the time that this spoiled the experience.I did enjoy the walk down the narrow lanes towards the temple though.
77,Number 1 attraction in Ajmer. Number 1 Sufi shrine in India. Miracles Happen here!,"All regards to the almighty, but it's highly over crowded place, a visit to this place reminded me Chandni Chowk of Delhi. This Dargah is located at bit elevated place and you got to walk for around 800 MTRS in inclined.. "
78,As holy as it can get,The place is centrally located in Ajmer & few points that the people should keep in mind is that just keep looking down & enter the dargah else there are local priest that will keep coming to you for money for darshan. Deposit your shoes to the last shop before the main gate of dargah you can take shoes till that shop whatever the locals may say as I wrote just keep looking down & go. Buy your offering & enter dargah & only go to the main retling place the priest might take you to other places where they'll ask you to make money offerings but best avoid it as it's of no use. Just go to main dargah & give your offerings with money on top INR 100 should work. Than come out sit there at the steps or hall for few minutes & come back. Best time to visit is evening.
79,Blessed with such a trip ,"I was vising very first time any Dargah and the visit was worth. As recommended by other travelers, I took flowers for offering and kept my footwear there. After entering one of the Imam convinced me to pay some bucks and I dealt smartly. The huge crowed and make a perfect sufi atmosphere. This place has really a vibration that will sooth you. One should must spend some hours by sitting and feeling the ambience."
80,Sharif ajmer dargah,"We had read a lot of pickpockets guide problems, etc. so we left our mobiles and money in our hotel room. Some guides did try to 'help' us but when we said no they left us alone. Dargah sharief is simply beautiful. But there are no boards to guide people. I dont even know if I saw the saint's kabar or not. I guess it would have been better to hire a guide for a small sum. I had read about the out of this world feeling of peace you get in this place, but I was skeptical till I experienced it too. And I did. And I will return. Never felt this way anywhere else before."
81,Cultural ,"Went there witn family in December 2018. The place was not crowded until afternoon. Took an auto near the power house to teh Dehli gate.  they charged INR 50. You have to walk for about 700 meters from Dehli gate to reach the shrine. There are shops along the way and the people would literally pull you to their shop for safe keeping of the shoes and in the hope that you'll but the flowers/chadar/garlands from their shop. DO NOT stop until you have reached the gate of the shrine. Once you reach the gate of the shrine, you have to take your shoes off and take them in your hands. There are shops just inside the shrine where you can keep your shoes. Shoe storage is free of charge and it is entirely upto you if you want to buy any offering. The visit to the main chamber when the sufi saint lies peacefully gets over pretty soon. There are people around the shrine who'll pull you and read some enchanted lines and touch your head with a kind of peacock feathered broom. Once done, they'll ask for money. DO NOT go to these people even if it seems that they are calling specifically to you. Overall it was a fun visit. But be aware about the people who'll literally pull you towards them and then ask for money."
82,A very calm and peaceful place ,a must visit place if your in ajmer its holy place for muslim try to go in morning as in afternoon and evening it can be crowded
83,Crowded and challenging,the place is not accessible by car...so u need to drop off and then take a rick or walk down..dont get pumped up if the rick takes you through narrow complex maze roads!...it happened to us!...you will find yourself going down narrow streets finally before you reach the tomb!...the place is crowed with many shops around...like most indian piligirm places you will find lots of shops and middlemen selling offerings and assistance...once u reach the tomb theres defenitely a sense of divinity around...its surely a lifetime experience to be here....
84,Should have been a great experience,Beautiful place . Its a mosque  for muslim prayers but people of all religions have faith and visit the same    Lot of shops  and its a good walk how ever be carefull of pick pockets and also the people around they will follow u till the dargah and offer ur prayer and then ask…
85,MOST CHALLENGING AND SCARY EXPERIENCE,"I had visited the Dargah Shariff on 17th February 2019.   It is really a good place. People of all Faiths go there and  submit themselves .  Eventhough  one has to pass through narrow and winding road,  on reachaing the Dargah, one will remain peaceful. It is a strong belief …"
86,"Crowded and most, yet serene and enchanting",holy place but there are too many beggar are there and trying to ask you for food money etc things overthere
87,Dargah Sharif Ajmer - a pious visit,As it is very famous it too crowdy also.  Don’t purchase costly  Chaddars  and prasad from there . Please don’t purchase  sohan halwa from the shops besides the dargah as they are so unhygienic and cheap in price . Please purchase from good shop.
88,Short and sweet visit,"As its is famous all over India, thought to visit this dargah and here was my experience.Pros:Cons:1. From 1 km before Dargah, people stop you to park the car. They charge 150 Rs per hour for car parking. Donot take your car there.2. For just less than 1 km, the autos charge 150 rs one way and 300 rs to go and come back from dargah. Its way toooooo much. All autowala do same.3. Inside Dargah also, they keep asking donations everywhere and want good donation.4. Its very very crowded place.5. For keeping shoes, they charge 20 rs. Pros:NothingTerrible experience. Do not visit this greedy area."
89,Visit to Ajmer Darga,Holly Shine place which provide worship and pleasant to heart. Must visited place..Take auto to reach dargah from cab stand. Must vist place
90,Holly Shine place,"Crowded entry to the Durgah. The walk to the Durgah is quite an experience with crowds that you are unlikely to experience elsewhere. Once inside the Durgah, the ""official"" people are asking for money left-right-and-center. After the darshan, beggers accompany you for a long, long time. However, it is a must-do item for everyone travelling to Ajmer."
91,Avoid battery carts,"Beyond words, a must place to visit, but the  person sitting inside seemed to force donating money , so management needs to be taken care of ."
92,VISIT TO KHAWAJA GARIB(Dargah Sharif),"A place where you meet your soul, The Dargah Shariff is holly divine, and every one must visit this place once."
93,Trip with family,Visited this place in the evening. It was flooded with people. There are various vendors outside the mosque where you can store your footwear and buy flowers and blankets.
94,Holy place with mismanaged people,Ajmer Sharif is beautiful and a great place to visit when in town but I got tired of being swindled out of money at every step. People kept asking for money in return for blessings and it just reiterated my atheism. 
95,"INteresting Dargah, worth visiting if you are in Ajmer","Vehicles are not allowed beyond a point from then on pilgrims are at the mercy of autos taking you for an adventurous ride in small lanes , flower sellers, even inside the shrine it's all money . Never take money out."
96,Holy place,"One can easily spend a whole day here. Its very peaceful. Made with white marble. Its looks very beautiful. Its has seven gates, but only 3-4 are functional for safety reasons. Its open day and night. However, the Darbaar sharif closes at night. Do not carry huge bags, the…"
97,Ajmer Sharif Dagah,"Excellent place, must visit to witness the grandeur and people's faith. The approach road may be a dampener but once u reach the dargah, it's beautiful"
98,Holy place,Ajmer is the popular city we go to worship by clear heart and there we see everyone comes like hindu muslim sikh mean every one awesome dargah and also he is the king of india everyone know....
99,Must do in Ajmer - ,"I visited the place on OCTOBER, 2015.  Not qualified to comment on the place.  Its an amazing place to be in. The Shrine of the greatest Saint in Islamic history known as the Badshah of Asia Khawaja Baba (Khawaja Moinuddin Chisti).  Do's: 1) Its a religious place for the…"
100,A Holy Visit,"The experience of my visit to this place was really good. The place have a huge gathering of people and most of the time you may feel that you are being driven by the flow of so many people. The entry and exit point is same and sometimes it creates lot of problem as there is no crowd management. Luckily the person who escorted us from the shop from where we took the offering (prasad and chaddar) was really a good man and guided us well for the darshan. He asked us to wait even when the people were pushing hard to get in. We waited for his instruction and when the crowed really got reduced he signaled us to proceed. There are many beggars and people selling things on the street but we had no problems of misshaping with us. May be we were extra cautious from the several reviews that we had gone through. We really went ""light"" to this place. There was always a word of caution from people starting from hotel followed by the auto-rickshaw man that we hired to go to this place and there was constant announcement over the loud speaker. Overall it was a great experience. Looking forward to visit again in near future."
101,Holy place to visit,I visited Dargah Shariff along with my friends on the way to pushker. Peaceful and cam place.Must be visited.
102,A place of faith,One of the most visited religious place. After leaving taxi we have to walk for 10 -15 minutes. Long queue will also take another hour to visitvmain dargah.
103,Go go and go,"We visited around 9am and there were not too many crowds and we seemed to be the only foreign tourists. Women must cover their head and wear long sleeves and not show any skin. The Sufi shrine is a very interesting holy site. We were prepared to donate money to the good cause of feeding the poor. We were ushered to a desk where the guy was writing in a large book and told we needed to donate before going in to pray, which was fine. However we were forced to donate 4 times altogether. Don’t let this put you off visiting but be prepared."
104,Place of worship,Must visit place if you are around Jaipur. You have spend some amount of money to get what you want.
105,Peacefull,"Located in interior of the city, this place has its own charm. It is open 24 hours and crowded as always. Won't say must visit when you are in Ajmer but I would say you should come Ajmer to visit Dargah."
106,Visit for Religious  Believe,YA great and lovely place of its kind. Felt inner peace and relax by just standing in there even after visiting for so many time. I just wana go again and again n againOne thing that touched my heart was that people of all religion was treated equally there.
107,Holy religious place,Its spiritual place as everybody know very well. Go there with true heart.One thing i don't like that inside dargah many people stop u and ask for money saying we will do special prayer for you.
108,Very bad experience ,"Best time to visit morning 6-8 am, otherwise very crowded place. Don't carry valuables, take care of mobile, jewelry etc. Shoes not allowed inside and it is must to cover head. Better to engage some known khhadim outside and do haazri otherwise they will make fool of you by asking money at various points. It should be managed in a better way."
109,Very Good Experience,Just spent one night in Adjmer so it is possible to see this amazing Dargah Shariff it was just 2000Rs from Centre via a hairraising TUKTUK ride. It would be impossible to find your way to the entrance by walking. A Warren of narrow and I mean narrow streets/lanes. Crazy traffic…
110,Avoid getting into the trap,"This is the place where you understand, religion and boundaries were made by us. Men women from all walks of life, irrespective of  colour, caste, creed and religious affiliations come for peace and get it too.There are no restrictions, no barriers. Just the head need to be covered.However like any other religious places, beware of the beggars and others forcing you to give donations. To ensure your money is rightly used for a good cause,recommend it be given in the office after obtaining a proper receipt."
111,Holy place,"For many years, I have been hearing of the durgah and hoped to visit it one day. Finally was able to go and take blessings. Since we are Hindu's we did not have any knowledge about what to do. The hotel provided us with a person thru whom, the visit went well. Pleased that finally I was able to go there."
112,Experience of its kind!,Awesome ambiance and good pious place. We loved our visit to the Dargah Sharif. Hope to return there one day again.
113,Must visit ,What a sirene and divine place with a different level of peace and fulfillment. This dargah has its own charm and charisma with a lot of believers with their own miracle stories! Would love to go again and again.
114,A Sufi Saint's Land,"Ajmer Shariff Dargah is a good Muslims religious destination and not a tourist destination. Please don’t heed to the words of people who approach you as free guides, they will cheat you. The street leading to Dargah is overcrowded and you feel very miserable."
115,Traveling to gujarat,"This place/shrine is quite famous among all religion & often visited by celebrities, world leaders & public.While in Ajmer we heard lot of bad things about the people around here. As per the advise from local people we put our wallets & other valuable in hotel and went there with limited money in pocket. Through out the way to Dargah people were approaching us to manage a  quick visit inside the Dargah. We bought a flowers & chaadar from a shop near the entrance & shopper assigned a guy with us to help us quick entry. The guy took us to guy inside & literally forced us to make donation despite we told them we don't have money at the moment. But they issue invoice & told us that the guy will follow us to hotel & collect money which they did.When we reached to main Dargah every single person inside were forcing us to make donations. It was so frustrating. Never thought of even in wild dream of this kind of behaviours at any Shrine place like this.Local administration together with Dargah management should look into it to stop earning bad name for Dargah due to these greedy peoples.The story didn't ens here while returning from Dargah the a bunch of women bigger were after us for money & they chased us until we sit in auto rickshaw & to our surprise as we didn't have enough money to give them one of them hit with hand to my wife to express there anger for not giving them money. Will never return for sure.The best time to visit Dargah would be between 2-4pm as we visited at this time & found little crowd."
116,Bad experience,"Very soothing and relaxing, one must visit this place. I would suggest to go in offseason as it is very crowded"
117,Holy Shrine,"This is not for regular tourists. Unless paying obeisance at the mausoleum the average tourist can give it a miss. If it happens to be a Thursday or the sixth of the month in the Islamic calendar you will be crushed in the melee of crowds. Even on ordinary days it is a scene of milling crowds all trying to pay respects at the shrine. Beware of pickpockets, vendors n pestering beggars."
118,Felt close to God,"The roads to Dargarh are narrow and over crowded. Beware of pickpocketers. Also try avoiding carrying any baggage, even a shoulder bag as it is not allowed inside the dargah. However many Nearby shops provide baggage deposition facilities. Overall a good place to visit."
119,Professional pick picketer gangs active in this place,Its very pious place for muslims.Situated near ajmer railway station.U can get variety of food and local artifacts from near by main market
120,Demanding money for prayer,Ajmer's major attraction has a lot to offer and gives you that feeling of oneness when you see devotees of all religions coming here to offer prayers.  The place is of huge importance in Islam.  The place has a huge Buland Darwaza and two large Deg. Both are a sight to watch. …
121,Commercial everywhere ,"Must visit (spiritual/relgious) Dargah of the great Sufi Saint.There is rush all year around.Fortunately, we had friends, who were able to organize a quicker route and acesss."
122,Terrible trap,"The most famous Dargah Shariff in India but not at all well maintained. Undoubtedly a lot of tourists visit this place and because of that this place is very crowded but in order to keep the essence of this place alive the management should maintain the Quality at this place. Listened to the Qawali at this place and it was very good, dargah didnt even have space of a person to stand properly for couple of seconds."
123,Peaceful,Very vibrant place to visit. We were there in November 2018 with family and offered our prayers to sufi sant. Place is very good but some people made it commercial but worth to visit and offer prayer...
124,Dargah sharif is a miracle,"Loved that place. A must visit for those who are seeking a spiritual retreat. We met people who helped us to undertake that spiritual journey in Ajmer. We would like to say Thank you to ""Ajaz Bhai Bajmer Khadim"" who accompied us all through out that Pilgrimage. "
125,Be Patient and careful,"It is a terribly crowded place, almost suffocating. You have to get down from the car about 1 km from the place, get into a private auto-rickshaw, go through a narrow and dirty winding road to reach there, The place is congested and at almost every step you are accosted by…"
126,A holly place of ajmer,"A place where all the wishes are fulfilled, following by a large number of believers from different communities. This reflects the communal harmony of citizens of India."
127,HOLY PLACE,This is a most and must visit place in Ajmer. Persons come in large number from within and outside the country. It  therefor remains crowded most of the time. It is recommended to take help of a guide from the Dargah for smooth visit and know the history.
128,A busy Shrine,There's nothing Islamic here.  All the non Muslim brothers and sisters are requested to visit local mosque in your area than visiting any shrine. Visit a mosque and feel the real peace in your heart.   Building a shrine is clearly prohibited in Islam. Don't mistake that shrines…
129,Filthy Place,"As a traveler across India, this is the only city which feels alive. One can literally feel the aura of Khwaja Gareeb Nawaz! There's a saying in Urdu - ""Fakeer to Shaho ke ghar jaate hai...Yahan to Shah bhi fakeer banke aate hai!"""
130,Feel the difference,You will be hounded by shopkeepers / agents and pushed in to giving alms by beggars. Just go and silently worship. Avoid falling in the trap of needing some help . It is very straight forward.
131,Melting pot of faith and devotion,when a new person goes middle person come and loot money from people. people come for having peace but this area became business area and police doesnt control anything other than standing there for VIP people
132,It was ok.,"Decided to visit here as it was rated number 3 on attractions when I visited India for a holiday.  My friend and I noticed that we were being followed by two males on a bike but they turned off shortly before we got to a parking area near the Dargah.  Then out of nowhere they appeared and the parking guy said they would guide us to Dargah.  We stated that we did not require guides however they were persistent and insisted.  They then called a auto which we took and it took us up the back roads through a quiet alley where at the end the guys on motorbikes again turned up.  They said they were taking us through a shortcut and led  us up a alleyway that appeared to be blocked by a metal gate as they entered a house.  At this point me and my friend made a hasty retreat and back to our car.  I've no doubt that had we continued we would have lost our valuables as a bare minimum and without anyone knowing we where had gone , even more.  So if you do decide to go see this place, make sure you are not being followed, stick to the main roads, do not carry anything valuable, let someone know you are going there! But in my opinion just look at the photos and save yourself all the trouble and worry!"
133,Nadeem Chishty a Dargah Priest made my visit worthful,"Dargah Shariff is a holy place and we are too much excited to go there. It's a really peaceful and religious place. You should never bargain with local shopkeeper because they really do misbehave. they will tell words which will keep you thing that is they mocking me? Inside dargah in most of the point priest will ask you for money. Inside dargah, you will get various so-called priest helper who will ask you money for darshan or chadar or something else. They don't maintain cleanness in dargah at all. there is no line management or people control management. Apart from all this, you will get good peace here. You will hear Sufi songs live. try to sit outside of the main dargah. You will feel different. You can buy few ornaments or books related to Dargah but it can be mispriced or expensive. My suggestion does not talk or listen to anyone inside dargah."
134,A common Place to Visit in Ajmer,Visit to Holy dargha is highly recomended. Try to visit early in the morning so that less crowd will be there.
135,Leave yours Stress here #Relaxed,One of the world's most spiritual place is Ajmer Sharif dargah I went there and such a lovely atmosphere out there I love it ..
136,Feel Of Heaven,This is a holy place and people across the globe used to come here. This place is open for all religions. People have faith in this place.This place is very small area and always crowded. Be careful of pickpockets.
137,Holy place,"You go to any holy place you will find peace. Being a hindu I visited Dargah Shariff. Had a lovely experience. It was my 1st Dargah visit. Though very crowded, I still found peace here."
138,"Historical place, visited again!","A spiritual place made famous by Bollywood, Ajmer sharif draws a large number of tourists.  Its usually very crowded.   Beware of touts/ beggars/ and other sundries who are out to earn a quick buck..either by shop merchandise or offering a quick darshan or similar,  Avoid if…"
139,First visit upon the call of khwaja ji 😊,"Most people go to Ajmer to visit this place for its religious value. The approach roads are pathetic and complex. The easiest way to go is to hire a local three wheeler (auto rickshaw) and trust the driver. The place is also extremely crowded at any point of time. For the faithfuls please visit this place early morning or very late evening(literally at night), if you want even a few minutes to bow your head."
140,Dargah Sharif,"spiritual feeling, bliss! We visit this place once every 3 months. We need to take care of our belongings during rush hour. Its heavenly feeling during the night time."
141,Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti Sanjari Ajmeri,Thanks to Ramada Ajmer for arranging vip darshan. It would have been imposaible with kids otherwise. Must visit if you are around
142,Must visit,Its a good place for worshippers. I arrived very early morning at Ajmer and booked a room. Therein at 7 am visited dargah. I advise you not hire any khadim. No need of chaddar to presented to the sufi saint and avoid beggars as all this is a kind of Money making tricks. Just sit outside the tomb under tree and wish.
143,Was a different experience all together,"Since there are thousand of people from all the religion visiting Dargah Sharif, there will be always rush in the area and to enter into the main area you have to wait is a queue, It is advisable to enter through Khadim (Person who are allowed to enter in Dargah from a different gate -Usually it is an association), you can pay some amount to them but you will have a best experience and can enter into the Dargah Sharif without any queue from a different gate"
144,Dargah shariff,Good experience. with the help of Peer Irfan bhai referred by Sanjay Sing of Badnor home stay where we stayed was  easy to visit baba chisti's dargah and offering our cheddar and flowers over baba's samadhi sthal and visiting other places inside dargah.  
145,An amazing experience,"It is know that from Akbar the great to Ritik who played akbar come here to get blessing, every party politician, different nationality but there is clear mistake management by local administration of roads reaching,parking,soecially cleanliness of roads the place which gives half 80% of tourist revenue dont have 5% of housekeeping people around it,there are no organised parking ,from delhi gate to dargah you need to walk or take auto through 4 ft wide road! But no govt person pay attention as they all come with red light vehicles to the main door of dargah.It is time technology is used in traffic management and crowd management also khadims with electronic I cards so no other outsider can misuse it. It garib nawaz who take care of all poor and needy for food and donations so at least khadims can make 4 to 5 people team to systematic the free food or financial help on fix timings on rotational restaurant outside."
146,Religious visit,The place is very holy and spiritual but the only problem is that people have commercialized it which is very saddening. Be careful of pick pockets and thugs everywhere.   
147,Beautiful place,Its worth visit when in Ajmer. The holy shrine is believed to be one of the most visited not only among Muslims but also by Hindus. This is also visited by lots of celebrities in India. Overall a good place but too crowded most of the time.
148,Pious,"No load of searching for stay, budget friendly rooms are available close to dargah. Train journey is suitable path to reach here. Board from Sarai Rohilla railway station during evening, you will reach Ajmer by early morning. Dargah is just 1-2 km from railway station."
149,Sufi Shrine,"From long time I wanted to visit ajmer dargah. We went on Friday ,it was too much crowded.To reach the dargah you need to hire auto or walk,private cars can't go till that place.its very peaceful and calm. Non veg is not allowed inside the dargah shariff"
150,Nice place but......,The dargah is located in the heart of city. The road to the shrine is very crowded. Same is the case with the srine itself. Don't carry too much luggage with you. Park your vehicle well before the srine as people have built private parkings near the dargah and costs from 100 to…
151,Pilgrimage part of tour,Visit if you really want to. I visited it and I didn't found people inside very friendly. Even people out selling prasad were rude. Inside forced offerings in form of money were asked too. It's good to quickly visit and come out.
152,Awesome Heaven,All places of worship bring a sense of faith in all of us! Been wanting to visit Dargah Shariff for a long time now and it was an etherial experience yet again! Sufi music sung by the people around the temple and the faith in someone bigger than all pf us makes your faith stronger in the Almighty! Offering a Chaddar and flowers and thanking him for his blessing upon us made this experience very memorable!!
153,A place of worship,"All these years, whenever I have heard about Ajmer Sharif, its because a bollywood star or a celebrity has visited this place with media giving it immense exposure. I had a chance to visit Ajmer Sharif during my short visit to Ajmer. Its located at a walking distance (5 min)…"
154,A must visit; the charm of Ajmer!,The place is very crowded. It is very hard to move around. People literally snatch money from you if you try to interact with the concerned personnels. There are a ton of things and there is no clear direction or instruction as to what is what. For a person unaccustomed to the…
155,A must visit,Your in Ajmer you must visit Dargah Shariff  Good pray your self and your family all religion visit there not only Muslim. ( khwaja garib nawaz ) sab ke murad puri kari
156,Eternal Peace,Dargah is holy place & situated at mid of Ajmer near railway station it is famous in the world it is
157,Religious visit ,"This time visit to Dargah was smooth. It took less time and we were not flocked by people who sell things at Dargah. We could sit and pray at peace. I wish the road to dargah should have been well maintained. Especially since we hear so much about Swachha Bharat, there is apathy towards maintaining cleanliness. There was no security check up also at the main entrance which was there earlier. Though vehicles are not allowed yet Govt vehicle seem to flout the rule. I think considering the importance of the Dargah, civic facilities could be much better."
158,The world famous shrine,"If in Rajasthan , do not forget to visit this place . It's a very scared shrine and a holy place .You can feel it . Though extremely crowded because of the sanctity of the place. It's 130 kms from Jaipur and try to visit in the evenings .Parking is a problem , hence many private owners have provided parking spaces around 500 metres before the shrine at a nominal rate of Ruppees 50 /- . I was on my bike , a RE Himalayan and i parked my bike in the parking so that it's safe .In side the dargarh you might get cheated by people for offering donations that goes directly into their pocket and you get no receipt of the donation . Be aware of that . Take care of your mobile phones and wallet . Keep any small bag and shoes at some shop where you buy chadar and handkerchief from , if you do not have your own vehicle."
159,The Khawaja palace,"Visited the famous Ajmer Dargah during my road trip from Delhi to Mumbai.  Situated in narrow bylanes of old city. Cannot reach without a local guide.  Very very crowded, especially during evenings.  People are sitting all over. One has to make way cris cross through them. One get the feeling of being blessed when one enters it.  Local groups control every activity. If you pay them (in garb of donation/charity), they will guide you properly, allow time inside the Dargah; otherwise...... Everyone warns you to be very careful of pickpockets. Your wallet and mobile are the targets. It does happen, so be extra careful or avoid carrying these items.  Irony is everyone knows about it but no one does anything to control it.  Who does it? Young boys from those local groups only."
160,Most visited,"Be focused  on the sacred place and never listen or follow the touts who pretend to help you and exploit you.  Just visit the place, pray and come out walking."
161,"Religion, peace and serenity at its own form......","Its the matter of faith and the belief which makes one go to Dargah Shariff. One has to walk through the dingy diggi bazar to reach the Dargah, The walk is enjoyable as you see the colorful shops en route and people cutting across all religions visiting the Dargah."
162,  Religious place for muslims but visited  by people of all religions ,The Dargha and the place has a different vibe.   You can offer Chaddar in the Dargha or else we can just have darshan.  Was a very good experience.   Must visit place if you are going on a visit to Rajasthan.
163,Too many beggars for a blessing. ,Number of times we have visited Dargah Shariff . Very peaceful place and one gets peace of mind while offering prayer
164,Ajmer jaipur agrA tour,Ajmer dargah Shariff is a religious place visited equally by Hindu and Muslims.  If one wants to connect with sufi spiritual world than it is unique.   But there are some problematic area such as transportation to this place and fear of pick pockets which sometimes seems to be hype.  Anyway one should avoid rush days. Otherwish it is must visit place if one plans to visit Ajmer.
165,Spiritual ,Everything Was Excellent.i would highly recommended this hotel for families and couples.and if you talk about location walk able distance from taxi stand and dargha bazar.
166,Devine,this palace is really kind palace  i love this palace .  when i go khawaja sahab dargah  than i fell really very amezing and heartly good  but inside many many frod liveing  please  live be safe  they charge you mony name on khawaja
167,Very peace full religious place,its very crowdy place its better to visit the Dargah early in the morning around 5-6 am. if u are in Ajmer then u should visit it.
168,EK PURSUKOON JAGAH,People from all over the world come to get blessings at Ajmer dargah. It is very crowded on the 6th of Islamic calendar every month. The yearly urss which is around 10 days is also very crowded.
169,Dargah of khwaja moinuddin chisti,As a muslim i fully recommand dargah sharif ajmer.because a great religious atmosphere waiting for you there
170,Great Dargah Khawaja Gareeb Nawaj.,Very good feeling after the visit. As usual crowd was rough on children as we entered the inner shrine. DO NOT take Auto ride. It was awful and open sewer/drainage. Better walk the main street.
171,No money needed! Unusually!,we went ajmer Dargah Shariff. we found peace People from other religion also come here . i was with my family
172,Holy place - a bit crowded,"I love to visit spiritual places ive been to many pilgrimage sites in India. But this one was really very different as well as challenging experience as a girl.The atmosphere of the small colony leading towards dargah was absolutely scary with beggars bothering you way tooo much on the way then also all the hawkers were after your life to buy the stuff from their shops to offer in dargah ( that was not compulsory). Everyone was so  bothersome and localites were not helpful at all.In the name of custom they all were asking money to offer prayers at dargah. I took 600 rupees and I was not left with a penny ,they all were really very rude. I would suggest if you want to go please plan it with some known person."
173,Oh God its was Friday ...!!,"We heard alot about Ajmer sharif.when we went there what we witness was terrible. The rates are so high outside the dargah. When we went inside the premises a so called baba stated follow us, he told us that he is from the committee.when we went inside the main dargah they started demanding donation . Flowers are lying on the floor and everybody was in a hurry. We were highly disappointed."
174,Amazing vist to Dargah,"You feel good after you visit, we were lucky we didnt get much crowd and got in very fast , the Qawali is just amazing."
175,Holy Place,"Very good place, but it is ideal to visit in the early morning, evening is generally crowded. Auto rickshaw and battery-rickshaw are the ideal vehicles to commute. There are several points to see inside. Mobile cameras are allowed."
176,Most visited place in Ajmer,"Inside the dargah , at Mazar, the space is not much and one has to quickly enter and exit because of huge rush. No time to remember Him. Outside the Daragah, one has to avoid beggars as some of them keep on following inspite you having no inclination to give"
177,Had a wonderful spiritual experience!! ,I came across several people on entering dargah sharif who were trying to make me buy several things and offer money to them but i went on quietly and then while coming near to the main shrine area a very good man with nice personality helped me in getting a corner sitting as there was huge rush. I thanked him and ask for bes way to offer my duties here and what charges i need to pay. The man did not ask for any money and made me do all necessary things any devotee will do and also gave me few gifts from dargah shrine. When i offered money he said no and just said that whenever i come again and if my wish gets fulfilled then i should do ooferings in dargah sharif and not to him. I asked his contact number and then left thanking him once again for his help
178,amazing,"I visited recently to Dargah and it was my first time. I took an auto to reach near to Dargah which must be around 2 km approx. lanes are very dingy and over crowded. people  can  ask you to take an assistance, I got a person from dargah who guided us to  inside the dargah.…"
179,Visited,"One of the most popular saint of God.when the king of India controls his realm with legitimacy there is no need to compell one to rupture his mind.peaceful,lucid spirituality,..etc.Khavvali ikhvan deploy waves of khavval with an attunement.."
180,DIVINE and PEACEFUL,Important place for Muslims situated just 2 kms from Ajmer railway station. Shared auto RS 20 from station.Worth place to visit darga of Moinuddin Chisti a Saint. Always crowded. Narrow street to entrance. It is unique here to dedicate Chaddar to the Darga Shariff.
181,Absolutely Sacred Place,"What to say about the charismatic attraction of baba. The whole world knows his miracles and love he spreaded throughout his life in ajmer. One thing I must say, people at there have no class or humanity. They are ruthless, manner less, greedy, selfish, disrespectful, thieves. Try to avoid the local people at their belongs to any any fields at their. Beggars are too much"
182,Holy commercial holi place in ajmer,It is very beautiful and faithful place at walking distance from Ajmer Railway station. A crowded Area but nice
183,Religious,One of the most important Sufi shrines in india. A place of faith and thronged by devotees from all religions. It’s crowded all the time of the year.
184,Most revered Dargah,"Dargah Sharif is visited by people of all castes and religions either as a place of faith or as a tourist attraction but needs better approach, more cleanliness outside without any beggars, same as all other religious places"
185,Not even approachable,One of most famous and millions of people have trusted this Sufi Dargah Shariff know by the name of Baba Ajmer and every Day tons of people have visited this just because of faith trust and expectations
186,Why can’t INDIA maintain its heritage. ,"It has great spiritual power. You feel calm, content and happy. It's a must for all who believe in spirituality and want to get peace."
187,Only for the very religious,Visited here with college friend dargah was located inside very crowded area. Flowers fregment was awesome
188,Just a tourist place,"It was not crowded as i went there last tuesday. There are spotters who keep an eye on the people coming in the lane towards the shrine & pounce on them nr the gate for you to buy chaddar or flowers, they are inssistent. I had spotted my spotter & was ready for him but then he told me to keep my shoes & bag at ""his"" shop, took me inside & then there are a lot of guys sitting in the tomb area with an end of chaddar outside where he inssisted that i put max money i could while he prayed for me. The money i gave was promptly pocketed. Then he told me to go to another person & more money was demanded. I saw people coming in from the exit side bcoz they had made some kind of payment & more payment to go inside in the tomb area. There was no food being served. More money was told to be thrown inside a huge pot used for community cooking."
189,Good but be ready for Crowds,"The place was over-crowded during the time I visited. I learnt later that it was due to the evening prayers held during that time. A visit to the shrine is recommended if you're travelling alone, but not suitable for people with physical limitations."
190,bad behavior of shop keeper outside,We got a very strong vibe at this holy shrine. It surely is the house of god and we would pray that he keeps calling us their again and again
191,Good Place,Maybe arriving a Friday just prior praying time was not the best idea but still the suffocating density of the (male of course...) crowd together with the tension in the street and the open hostility of some didn’t help to feel welcome. We thus missed the tomb inside and don’t…
192,One of the holiest place of India,"The experience was nice, I visited the shrine in the morning at around 9 a.m. and the amount of crowd was manageable.Though there are several beggers that try to approach you for money but it won't trouble you much if you know how to ignore them.It will be better if you don't carry much things alongside specially money.The sufi songs played outside the gumbad are quite pleasing and refreshing. Better to sit there for a while and relax.I went there after going through the reviews of other people and have found them really helpful."
193,"Visit to Dargah Sharrif, Ajmer","The main draw for tourists in Ajmer, walking to Dargah Sharif through labyrinthine lanes reminded me of being in Kinari Bazaar. This was an experience in itself. But the serenity, atmosphere and experience of the dargah is amazing. A must visit."
194,A truly peaceful conversation with Khwaja,"If you are travelling to worship Khwaja Moinuddin Chusti or just to see what is the special there; as it is an important piligrim place for Mughal rulers. The place is very very poorly maintained including Police stand / sit in the entrance with no control on the crowd. Be careful with strangers, who try to approach you to sell something or guide you. They will divert your attention and take your belongings. Put extra care on your Jewels, Wallet, Mobile and Kids. If you are entering the Dargah, you need to have your head cover with cloth. Take money for offering if not the helpers there will shout or manhandle you."
195,A solid example of Religious Unity amongst the Vast Diversity in India. ,We visited the Dargah enroute to Jaipur from Pushkar. The place was very crowded and we were thankfully warned of pickpocketing etc. The parking area is quite far from the Dargah and it is advisable to hire a local auto to get to the place.
196,Mosque,"Dargah Shariff is in the Muslim area of town. Its worth the trip there for the surrounding area. This mosque is surrounded by a vibrant and very busy souk with many interesting stalls and shops. It is very crowded, you need to catch a Tuk Tuk there and once there you have to walk, because there is no traffic allowed."
197,Dargah Sharif Ajmer,I went to Dargah Sharif Ajmer. It is most popular and important Muslim pilgrimage in Rajasthan. People from all the communities come here and pay homage in the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer Sharif. It is great place to go.
198,Sacred place But too crowded.,"We visited the Holy place of Dargah Shariff in first week of jan19 and it was such a nice and blessed trip that we cannot define in words. Although the entry is quite congested to the Dargah but once you enter the Dargah, it’s Shine and atmosphere takes you to the other world. We were totally blessed with our sight since we meet “Fakri Baba Ajmer Dargah Sharif” who is supped to be the one of the old caretaker and known from Dargah- he has also shared his no. If anyone wants to visit.. they absolutely do not charge anything and we being Hindu finds a true and great support from them..they took us to the main Dargah and we were hugely blessed.."
199,Visit if you want to simply kill time,This was my first visit to Dargah. For making entry to the Dargah one need to park vehicle at around half a Km. On the complete way people will be offering you chaddar for Shrine and other stuffs. You will find a lot of uncleanliness in the way. There are some specific time at which Dargah gates open.
200,Dargah Ajmer,"Peaceful, Religious placeIslamic Historical place, 800 years agoSaint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (r.a.)"
201,Worth visiting,"The Dargah is a big attraction for visitors. We parked about a km away from the Dargah and walked the pathway to the entrance. On both sides there are numerous stores. Typically a very large footfall everyday given that this is a famous shrine. We were lucky to get a ""darshan"" in close quarters. We offered flowers and prayers for everyone. And had tea inside the temple. The Dargah is very beautiful and one can feel the vibe of calmness ( you have to stand for a few moments and look for it).The way back to the car was a bad experience. Children keep running and pushing for alms. They get very violent and noisy. When we were getting into the car they had the audacity to start beating the doors and windows - at one point I really thought the glass would break. I felt very sorry for the children - they are probably not even driven by their parents to beg but by the traffickers who operate in the place taking advantage of the children."
202,KGN,Dargah is a place for which Ajmer is famous.  More non muslim people visit this Shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chisty then muslims. A place of visit since moghul times
203,The holiest of the shrines,This is the major attractive point in Ajmer. People are mainly come to Ajmer for this place only. This is very nice place and around the market is good.
204,"No management, and too much commercialized..",Must visit when in Ajmer. I would recommend visiting Dargah early morning at 6-6.30 am. It looks more beautiful in the lights in the morning. Buying chaddar is according to one's wishes and there is no compulsion. Don't carry wallet or mobile phones. Lot of theives around. Wear…
205,A must visit site in Rajasthan,We had a very bad experience there. My daughter's were wearing frocks and they were not allowed to enter inside. The behaviour of the person at the gate was very rude. They asked to wrap my shawl around my elder daughter's legs. I did but the man on the gate was still not happy. He said their rule regulations are different. My husband entered inside and offered the chadar. But later we were allowed to go inside wrapping my shawl around my elder daughter's legs. But I was already so unhappy seeing all these I could hardly pray there and returned with a heavy heart.
206,Spiritual...,It was my long pending dream to visit Ajmer Shariff Darga for prayer. But the time we reached at that place it was namaz time so we got stuck and once it’s done the crowd was so bad that I was about get stamped. With the blessings of baba I managed to come out from the crowd.To avoid the crowd one should check the timing of Namaz and other holidays. So can come and pray peacefully. One should be very careful about fraud people and pickpocketers. Like all other pilgrims this place also having people who will force you to pay money to show your devotion towards Garib Nawaz Khawaja Baba. But as like the name “ Garib Baba” never asks for money or expensive gifts except a pure heart.
207,Divine,"Must visit for me as and when am in Ajmer The land of Prithviraj Chauhan.It’s feel like heaven when you are inside the mazar, it’s a divine feeling when the chadar is dropped on your head by the priest.It’s a place where you can see people from all religion coming to seek Khwaja Saab’s blessing.True India and Indian spirit."
208,Sufi sant ,The experience is calming and satisfies those who visit here year after year regardless of their caste or statuses
209,Spiritual Trip,"A visit to Ajmer Sharif is highly recommended. A very calming and peaceful experience. The dargah is 1-1.5 km walk away from the nearest parking, hence be prepared for a walk in the heat (if you aren't visiting during winter months). The roads are flanked by shops selling traditional rajasthani collectibles. Parking is a bit of a problem and would cost around INR 100. Some might ask you for more, please negotiate."
210,Too loud a place for a holy shrine. ,visited here when returning from pushkar to jaipur. the parking is nearly 1km away from the dargah. when walking towards the dargah both sides are lined with food eateries. usually this is a crowded place even on non-Friday. moinuddin chisti breathed his last here & Mohd Tuglaq constructed this dargah in 14th century its very calming experience and people of all faiths are treated equally here.
211,Once upon a time,"Make sure your belongings are safe as the area is filled with dodgy people and touts. Also ensure that you don't eat anything anyone gives you, unless it's the offical deg."
212,place where you meet your soul,"There is so much of history, with religious significance here. The energy is palpable. The surging crowds and the fact that you are warned to be careful of your wallets is a challenge. I guess the secret is to ask for and pick a time that is non peak hours. Have heard that early…"
213,People are not good,"You can't miss this place as this is a holy place as well as the famous attraction in Ajmer.  NOTE : 1. Avoid driving your car to Dargah. Use public transport as you can to be there. Because there is a problem of parking and if you get parking there then still you have to walk 500m or 1 KM to dargah from your vehicle. 2. Avoid taking important/ personal documents or mobile phones into Dargah. As this is crowded place as well as people out there not also recommend for these things. If you take these things in, take care of things and hold them very carefully."
214,Most iconic place in Ajmer,Very nice people . Mr.Chisti who accompanied us from one of the flower stalls was very helpful.Do not get scared by what people say .
215,Just Ok,It was 806th Urs going on when we went there which happens every year. It was during 2nd fortnights of March. This time there is a huge crowd and one has to walk for around 500 mtr to reach to the place. The lanes are narrow and hence auto needs to be hired from main road who…
216,very pleasing place,We chose to visit this shrine as it is one of the top suggestions when visiting Ajmer. Our journey there with our two drivers was intimidating for them as we drove through tiny lanes to get there. People made threatening remarks to them. Once there our guide took us close and we…
217,"A very sacred place , positive vibes all around",However we we're lucky that we didn't faced a crowd.one kilometer away from dargah the agents will start following you for a convenient visit.ufff...leaches like...inside the dargah they openly ask you for donations. I offered 20rs ND the guy said what is this.i said it's my shradha ND God doesn't want or ask for money.blunltly he said but we do .humen TOA cahiyae.... everyone wants money.even a shoe keeper is charging rs 5 per pair
218,Place where one can feel close to HIMSELF,"I visit the dargah annually, it gives immense peace to me. Usually, the dargah is very crowded, it is better if you visit alongwith one of the khadims, makes the visit easier."
219,Very crowded,"I visited the sacred shrine on 10th August post winding up my session from gurgaon. Barged into one of the shop that was i guess 2nd from the dargah entrance.Shop ppl guided me well, plus Babar bhaiya ( khadim) assisted me to the shrine. Felt peace, almost brokedown while…"
220,sharif dargah ,lovely feeling when i come khwajagarib nawaz dargah such a mesmerizing feeling it was i come herebafter 2 years back and i feel such a lovely feelings when i saw khwajah mazar
221,Only place where even Allah cant help you,"Yes, it is interesting from the point of view of history and architecture, BUT it is impossible to photograph and it is necessary to stand in line with the pilgrims. As usual, I liked the local market located nearby."
222,HOW TO AVOID THEFT IN DARGAH SHARIFF,"We visited the holy Dargah in Ajmer on our trip to Rajstahan! As cautioned by fellow travellers on pickpocket etc, we kept all our valubales i,mobile etc in our car and started from parking area by an auto. Auto charged 100 rupees from our parking in fountain circle. As this is…"
223,Divine place to visit!!,During our way to Jaipur from Udaipur we visited this famous divine Dargarh of Ajmeer. The place was so crowded with full of different religious people.
224,Divine Experience,"This is the Dargah of the famous Sufi saint , who adopted Humanity as his religion If you get a proper guide, he will explain you the history ..the rituals and the offerings Make sure you stay light on your baggage as it’s a very crowded place and you may loose things The few minutes inside the shrine are the most beautiful and peaceful of it"
225,Spiritual Journey,"Please walk down to the Dargah from parking place, avoid hiring battery carts for the first time visitors"
226,Holy Place,We visited during late morning.We could offer our prayers easily. One should visit at least once in life time. You need to get down half a km away and take local auto or walk down. Lot of shops on the way to dargah.
227,Short Visit Experience,"24  hours Chek out time , 24 hours room service  service ,hot&cold  water facilities, Docter on call parking  facilities, family enwarment."
228,Dargah Sahib - Where all faiths meet,"Incidentally I was reach Ajmer from Jaipur that is 134 km far, on 12.03.2019. I feel lucky their running 807th Urs of famous Sufi  sant Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Dargah. Best time to visit in winters. "
229,One word..Serene!,"Dargah is the place Ajmer is famous for. It is the tomb of Khwajah Salim Chisti (garib nawas, means protector of the poor). This is a must visit place. It’s a quite different feeling inside..But, beware of the local beggars there. They will come behind you for any distance, till they get something, saying ‘if you give them alm, garib nawas will protect your family, otherwise he will curse them etc’. Just give them a blind eye. If they notice any attention towards them, they will tighten their grip.And so is the people inside the tomb. They will force you to put money inside which I really felt pathetic and disgrace to Khwajah. You can’t take camera inside. There are people in shops who offer us to keep our cameras safely, but there is a govt locker before the dargah gate. You can carry mobile and purse inside. Except near the main tomb, we can see people taking photos and selfis without any restrictionsThere are so many people there to help you to see and pray inside the dargah, but I got disgusted with the beggars and the people forcing to put money"
230,Excellent service,"Narrow,crowdedlanes,shops dotting the way till the gate.Be careful of pickpockets. Bliss guaranteed."
231,Historical place to visit once a life,"This is holiest of the places which attracts people from all over India  and abroad irrespective of their religion - we can see the ocean of people - Hindus ,Muslims , Sikhs all come here with faith and merge in prayers from heart . The shrine of the Muslim saint  chishti also…"
232,It is an ordeal getting into the dargah.,This the Dargah of a legend.He played key role in spreading Sufi movement in India.He has left many stories with impact on millions.He reamains popular who has brought people together with his teachings.Very soothing to visit his grave.May his soul rest in peace!
233,Truly Religious Place,You must visit Ajmer Sharif dargah. They keep singing their qawwalis. You just sit there and you will find yourself lost in another world. 
234,Religious place,"Our driver arranged for a guide who will take us inside the dargah. We took an auto for INR200 and were taken through back streets near to Dargah. Guide came along with us from there. He claimed to be a chishti. We bought a chadar and this person took us inside the dargah. He was able to go near the kabar and place our chadar on top. Lot of people were trying to extract money from us while we were going inside. Since this guide knew everyone, he was able to avoid all of them. If you buy chadar, flower etc, guides get commission. So they also h ave an interest in you buying more stuff. All religious people come to this dargah. But most sunni's in muslims dont go to dargah, as they dont want to give their prayer to anyone other than the one god. Anyway, it was a new and different experience for all of us."
235,Ajmer dargah sharif,"Dargah Shareef in Ajmer is an experience that can only be felt. When I went there the first time, I could feel the spiritual warmth and the strength of its followers' beliefs that makes it such a rich experience. I especially enjoyed the qawwali that happens every evening before and after Maghreb prayers. if you are in Ajmer, remember to sto p by and pay your respects. Do meet Zeeshan Kaptan, one of the many khadims at the shrine, who know the place inside out. I stayed with them for 3 days and they treated me like their family member!"
236,Divine feeling even when you're at the railway station!,"The Dargah Sharif is to Ajmer what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. It is the main attraction of the city. You can access it only on foot or by auto through narrow lanes where two people cannot walk past each other without rubbing shoulders. We had a VIP Darshan, but you can go in…"
237,Dargah Shariff AJMER - Not as peaceful as you think,"The tomb of the revered  13th century Sunni mystic Moinudeen Chisthi draws pilgrims of all Faith's. Akbar and his wife are said to have made a pigrimage on foot from Agra and Shah Jahan had constructed a huge gate in this Dargah.The Dargah is just about two kilometers from the Ajmer railway station and one can get a autoricshaw or taxi. The Dargah remains closed from 1.30 pm to 3 pm for daily prayers. One can complete the Dargah visit in about two hours.Be wary of touts who are representatives of the shop lining the approach road selling chaddhars for draping the tomb. They entice you into the shop offering space for storing your slippers, pressurise you into buying a chaddhars which the person accompanying you will eventually return to the shop! There are a number of 'Holy men' seated inside who try to get money from you presumably for prayers. Please don't get conned.You can offer prayers at the Dargah for which a chaddar is not mandatory. You can carry your slippers into the Dargah properly packed or leave it outside. Be careful of pickpockets who create an artificial rush and aim for your mobiles, ornaments and purses.There are reasonably good restaurants outside where the food is good. Do not encourage beggars who will keep following you. Ignore them.It's very unfortunate but the peace and tranquility of the Dargah has been buried by the crass commercialisation and greed."
238,Sufi place ,"Recent visit to the famous Dargah Sharif in Ajmer was quite enlightening. The shrine is within a kilometre from the railway station. One can either walk or take a rickshaw or shared battery operated auto rickshaw, all of which leave the pilgrim near the entrance. The shrine entrance has an impressive gate. One has to walk bare-footed inside and can wash his face, hands and feet before reaching the main shrine and must cover his head properly to get inside.It is heartening to see people of various faiths visiting the holy shrine with their offerings and paying their reverence. It is believed that wishes made by devotees are always answered."
239,Experience to visit the Holy Shrine.,"After Visiting pushkar, I visited Ajmer Dargah Sharif. I took my vehicle there. If you are going by your won vehicle, go to MD parking. they charge Rs 50 per hour. other hotels will charge Rs 100. they take Rs 100 as advance and return, if you come even a minute before. The moment you park your vehicle, you will be sorrounded by riskhsaw walas. They will ask you for Rs, 200 for to and fro journey, which is NOT AT ALL NEEDED. Mosque is just 700 meters away. you can easily walk. Remeber: Keep all your valuables in vehicle. One member of the family can take his wallet or only cash with him/her. keep your mobile phones safe. After you reach there, or u start your journey, call this person, IMRAN, he is NIZAM in khawja Gareeb Nawaz. His contact number is: 9828232797. I got his contact from one of my friend, who hails from Ajmer. Try visiting in late evening hours, as you will get less crowd. Go toghther, hold your hands tight. Do not talk or look at anyone during the walk. People beg money like anyhting. They forcefully sell items on the way. Call Imran and he will come out of the Buland Darwaja. He will show your the place to remove your shoes. While returing , you will get your shoes back and you might have to pay rs 20-50, which is worth. Imraz will tell about the history of Dargah, small and big deg on both the sides. He will ask you to purchase chadar. you can do that, if you wish. try purchsing something around Rs 300 all together. Do not put more money in that. Click some pictures. he will take you inside the main dargah and will ask you to put some money as 'daan', if you wish you can do that too. I ddint put any money. The kabbali inside the campus is awesome. you can spend some time there. Last, he will not even ask you to give some money, even if you ask him, he will say, ""I wont say anything from my mouth"", its your wish. Even if you give him rs 20, he wil accept. I would say, you can give from Rs 100-500 depanding on yourwish. no need of any shopping, as there is loot. go safe, visit and come safe. Imran will make your visit easy. Call him before your start your journey to dargah."
240,Holy Place for all religions,"The shrine of one ofbthe holiest Sufi saints of the Chishti order attracts devotees of all faiths and cultures. It is located close to the city centre, and is approachable by a narro road on foot or Cycle rickshaw. Vendors and shops line the route on both sides of the crowded street. The shrine is managed well, with Khadims willing to help for a fee. Be warned of pickpockets and conmen out to fleece."
241,Out of this world feeling in this place,"If you believe in the blessings of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chisty then the dangers, irritants and challenges of reaching the Darga, all become inconsequential. Neither would the crowds deter you. I went, placed a chaddar on the tomb, prayed by offering flowers and felt happy.There are two entrances to the inner sanctum where the actual tomb is located. The side entrance is to offer chaddar and flowers and pray. The central entrance is to touch your head to the actual tomb. As in most religious places, one has to leave one's foot wear near the entrance to the Dargah and walk barefoot inside. The going gets a bit yucky at times with dirt and crushed flowers all around. All flower and sweetmeat stalls offer facilities to leave behind your footwear. However the safest place is the stall immediately at right of the main entrance. That's the official footwear safekeeping facility and also results in least barefoot walking.   You would also be buying a chaddar to offer at the tomb and a handkerchief to cover your head. Best to get those from the stalls well inside the Dargah complex, rather than from the stalls outside. Prices inside are fair and you can avoid bargaining. Not so at the stalls on the road outside. But the visit is fraught with challenges. The road leading to the Darga is choc-a-block with people all round the day, except maybe early in the morning. Pickpockets are rampant. Both outside and inside the Darga. One has to be careful with whatever you have in your pockets. Beggars accost you on your return from the Darga and they can get quite aggressive. Just ignore them and walk on."
242,Pray with Purity......,"To start with, one must know that Ajmer is known for its very narrow bylanes and hence the only way to get till the Dargah is by foot or by Auto. If you have a car, then you will have to park it in garages made for that specifically and they charge heftilyEveryone is involved in the business, so the parking lot chap will guide you to an autowaala, who will then route you to a guide who takes you inside the Dargah through shorter routes. This maybe worth it if you want to do this quickly and want to avoid walking a lot because the streets leading to the Dargah are very crowded. The whole visit is an experience and rushing this will probably make it bad. So I would recommend that once you get there, you may respectfully let go of the guide, because he is bound to extract some money from you by way of pushing you for a contribution ( usually in thousands of rupees). Inside the dargah is like any religious place in India with a lot of jostling around. So a visit in the early hours of the day is more suitable. A lot of people in the chain will keep asking for some money all the way. If you dont like all this then its best to learn to ignore going inside but then that beats the point of going there. Overall, one wishes that the place was quieter and that the crowd was organised so that one can truly appreciate the great history of the place. Dont miss peeking into the huge pots that continue to cook the offerings to the KhwajaVisitors need to cover their heads. A cap would do. No need to buy anything there. Beware of pickpockets as this place is infamous for them"
243,Connecting with Almighty! ,"It is about 120km. from Jaipur,the capital of Rajasthan. One can rent a taxi which takes RS. 3000 to 3500, depending on your bargaining capacity. It includes all toll taxes and other statutory charges, one has to pay during journey. We started our journey on morning 9O'clock and reached Ajmer Shariff by one o'clock. However it is a journey of three hours one side. Taxi driver cautioned us about pickpockets. Do not forget to take the contact no. of driver. Because for the paucity of parking place he may have to park the vehicle somewhere may be nearby or far. One will get three wheelers for the journey to Dargah from the place wher your taxi has dropped you. But it only a distance of about 500mts. From a distance you will see the gate of Shrine. Both side of road is having shops of flowers and Chaddar used for offering. Offering is not mandatory. You may put your shoes in the shop where from you buy the offerings or you may just keep them in front of the staircase. You will be welcomed by the Khadija, volunteers of Dargah. We did not take anyone's help and headed towards the tomb of Pir saheb ,it was a small and crowded room and my friend then felt somebody entered hand to his pocket. Anyway we came out from that room paying our respect. In evening there is quali song at that courtyard. We came back to Jaipur at evening 17.00hrs."
244,Hotel Dastgeer Palace ,peaceful place and dargah of famous sufi saint khwaja sahab. take his blessings for a peaceful mind . journey for soul
245,Good visit,"The dargah itself is relaxing but to get there is quite an interesting experience. Hopefully next time we go, the roads are good."
246,Feel blessed ,We requested the hotel we were staying at in Pushkar- The Gulab Niwas to arrange a guide for us. They put us in touch with one of the khadims manager who took us inside and was with us through the entire time. We had always wanted to visit here and finally were able to. Thanks…
247,Peace-full Dargah Shariff,"Being a Hindu, I had some hesitation and little bit of fear, I don't know why. But my experience was very good. I offered Chaddar, which is a common ritual. God willing, I will visit again."
248,World Famous Shrine,"We had a paid guide who was suppose to take us and provide us with history. In stead, when he took us through small alleys to reach to the shrine, he was demanding that we have to buy shawl worth Rs 5000, otherwise we wouldn't be allow to  go inside. This was not true. We saw people going inside without any offering and told him so. but he wouldn't budge and was intimidating us including threatening  us that we won't be able to go out without any harm. We didn't baulk and he could see we were going to be firm. So we came back in Rickshaw and then went again. He also told us that inside the shrine they won't accept any money. Again this wasn't true. They were asking for money as well. This is bad for a shrine but this is what these thieves have made it. Your faith suddenly is questioned. Certainly we won't be going there again!"
249,Good place,"ALMOST EVERY VISIT TO INDIA, I NEVER FORGET TO VISIT DARGAH. ONLY ONE ISSUE THE TOURIST MAY FACE IS LOSS OF THERE BELONGING IN DARGAH. I CAME ACROSS THIS HOTEL CALLED Hotel Royal Ajmer  IN DARGAH STREET, i kept all my belongings with them, they took care of our things and  guided us thru from arranging flowers chaddar etc and someone who can take us to dargah to help pray. in return we had our meal with them.  hope u have wonder stay."
250,Extremely crowded but worth the visit!,If coming by your own vehicle then park your vehicle at private parking place just before Dehli gate Ajmer. Here it's a walk down to dargah about 700-800 metres. It's better to take electric rickshaw or walk by your own by staying alert of pick pocketers. Deposit your shoes at shop just outside the dargah and buy some flower or chaddar for offering.
251,Very Soulful But Little Crowded,In Ajmer Khwaza Moinuddin Christy R.A.  Dargah Sarif is best travel point and religious place for all. 
252,Crowded,"What can you give to the almighty, he doesnt need anything. Khawaza ji, if you are connected to him, you understand sufiism, you are blessed. He called us and we were there right in middle of amazing crowd, you cant even put your feet but if he has called you, you are blessed.…"
253,Faith is what matters.,I visited Ajmer with friends just to visit this Dargah. I reached Ajmer at 3 in the night and visited Dargah at 9 in the morning. All the things were smoothed. But the problem is you’ll find Beggars all around which won’t be leaving if you didn’t give them something. They will demand higher amoount in cash or in kind. So I would suggest please don’t listen to them and keep walking. Inside the Dargah everything is good and you’ll find peace going inside
254,"Peaceful Holy Durgah Shariff,Ajmer","The roads to visit this place can only be travelled on by the auto rickshaw. The roads are not good quality at all, and they are very narrow too. That's where first disappointment happens.  Next, when you reach to the Dargah, they force you to buy something from outside to…"
255,Avoid when the sun is at its peak,"Ajmer is a rough two-hour drive on an excellent highway from Jaipur.For us it was truly a dream come true to visit Ajmer Gareeb niwas. Park your vehicle in the designated parking lots and it is a moderately stiff walk of  about a kilometre to the gates of the Darga. You can also make use of the rickshaws available for the same. Do not fall prey to the aggressive touts and take good care of your belongings.You can pick up flowers or chaddar for offering if you so wish;but going in with prayers is all that is really required.You will join the queue and depending on the crowds you will be ushered into the place where Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti rests.The khadims are NOT peaceful, commercialisation is writ large, and DO NOT FALL PREY to their 'Dalo, Dalo.'Fridays see very large crowds, so also do days of Urs,which you can check from their website.Once inside, if you can ignore the noise and the crowrds, you can have a heart to heart conversation with the presence."
256,My best visit to Hind O wali khwaja sharif,"It was a humbling moment , cutting across religions , all bowed down to invoke blessing. Only that , crowd of imposters try to get into spending money  otherwise loved it ... For me another imp destination ticked."
257,A grand pilgrimage for people of all religions,"I am a regular visitor to places where one can talk to oneself, and this is one of those places I have visited"
258,u will get peace of mind there,"Khwaja Garib Nawaz, most visited Sufi Muslim shrine In India and it is greatest Sufi Dargah in India. anyone can visit Dargah . during the day, as open early morning and closed in late evening,  everyone should cover head and women also cover shoulders and both can wear long trousers, because it is religious place, this is place where you feel good and real peace.all religions people come to visit Dargah sharif from India and Indian sub continental.thanks"
259,Important Muslim Pilgrimage,"I visit every year to this sacred and divine place of Khawaja Garib Nawaz (sufi saint), Calm, peace what you will get over here.Best time to visit during early morning between 7 to 8 am  when crowd is less and you will get full view.Never get acquainted with khadims (servant) over there, check properly and then fix it , they will take you inside for offering chaddar, all your wishes will get fulfilled (insha Allah)  as such divine intervention is there at this place.You will get to see big vessel where sweets are prepared for all people, must to see when you are at dargah.Good restaurant outside (Kaynaat) and Jannat Palace, enjoy all delicacy, never get tricked by shops and shopkeepers as they keep calling you for shopping, take your own decision.Nearby there is aana sagar , take a ride and reach in 15 to 20 mins , for peaceful relaxation.A MUST PLACE TO SEEK BLESSING AND GETTING ALL WISH FULFILLED."
260,spiritual,We must learn to respect our heritage with more pride.  Keep it clean and presentable.  Regulate traffic to and from.  It’s sad to see people paying money and bringing garbage to a place of prayer.  
261,Where wishes come true,"The only highlight in Ajmer was an amazing tuktuk ride to the Dargah Sharif, flying down narrow alleys around potholes, scooters, people, cows, pigs, and chickens all at breakneck speed and then walking around the Islamic shrine. Fascinating evening inside and all free but for…"
262,A good experience,"Hi,      I visited this place today evening with my family and small kid,when I came here earlier few years back it was used to be a nice place where your soul used to have divine feeling,however today my experience become worst as while going to dargah lot of shopkeepers will be behind you to stay in the hotel or to buy the blanket for dargah or to keep the bags in their shops and even the priests and people around divine dargah were also asking for money,when we came out,beggars started following us continuously and if you don't give money to them they start debating and cursing, overall I came to this place for peace but I only found business and beggars all over the place."
263,A fulfilling experience depending on the day and time,"Dargah Ajmer Sharif is one of the most revered Sufi Shrines in the country, visited by devotees from all religions.  It is believed that a person who prays with a pure heart will get the wishes fulfilled. One of the most visited places in the City. We visit the Shrine every time we are in Ajmer and find peace of mind. Truly a divine visit."
264,A place beyond words ,Ajmer Darga sheriff is situated in Rajasthan state. This shrine has the grave of a Sufi Saint Moinuddin Chisti since 16 th Century if I am correct. Now the darga is famous for its benefactor aid. The Muslim and Hindu people flock in to receive the blessings of the Saint. I have visited the Darga in October 2018 with my friend. You have to cross many gates and the pestering traders who sell chadars. They offer free service of keeping watch on your foot wear. Do not go by their words. There is foot wear stand inside you can leave the foot wear and take a token. The Darga receives donations from the visitors at a separate counter. The treatment towards a hIndu devotee is different near the central shrine. .
265,A pious place thats an enriching visit,The place is at a walkable distance of approximately 1.5Kms( 20 minutes or so)  from the ajmer Railway Station (platform no. 1 side)...A very peaceful and calm place..make sure one has enough time to enjoy and experience and soak in the calmness of the place
266,Spiritual place,"As mentioned in some reviews, we did not experience much hassel. The reason was that arrangements were made by the Hotel. An autorickshaw took as to the Durgah Shariff and a khadim took us round for Darshan. We chose to walk back to get the feeling of the lanes and local food and sweets selling there. Yes one comes across beggers an if you give some money or sweets to one, there will be a crowd of them following you, so ignore and move on. We did not carry any hand bag or pouch. One must experience the walk along the busy road to learn about people, culture and traditions. The place is overcrowded on special days but we were lucky not to find much crowd. There were no unnecessary demands by the Khadim. We had a peaceful Darshan and feel blessed"

268,Kawaja moino din chisti Dargah,"My second visit to Dargah of Gareeb Nawaaz in Ajmer . What can I say ,it's a wonderful place to offer your prayers to the Almighty . Very peaceful and tranquil ,though always bustling with activity ."
269,Ajmer visit,Dargah Sharif Ajmer is the famous Dargah and from all over the world people are coming to visit Dargah Sharif...
270,KHWAJA MERE,"This is a shrine of a saint Moinudin Chisti who migrated to India and settled at Ajmer. He embraced the poor and downtrodden with an open heart. It is believed that all wishes made here with sincerity always come true. Emperor Akbar was granted a son after his visit here when all else failed.To reach the tomb, park your vehicle near Delhi Gate. It is best to take a volunteer guide. Then take an autorickshaw to the access point that is reached after driving through narrow lanes. On reaching the entrance of the shrine complex, you will need to remove your shoes and deposit them against a token, and cover your head with a handkerchief or a scarf (yours of borrowed from the shops at the entrance). Entry wearing shorts etc is not permitted and you can borrow a loincloth to cover up.None of the above needs to be paid for, but any money you wish to pay with gratitude is welcome. Cost of autorickshaw ride both ways is just Rs.200/- or US$3/-Once inside, you can buy a cloth sheet and rose petals to offer at the shrine. Again, any charity you wish to make is welcomed.As you approach the shrine, the crowd gets compacted. Do not carry a wallet or valuables, or keep them in your front pocket. The final passage to the shrine is tighter than the proverbial sardines in their tin. There the offerings are taken, and showered on the shrine by the helping holy men who say prayers for you. Make your wishes selflessly. After exiting, tie a thread on the gate railing, and when your wishes are granted, on your next, remove a thread as a token of thanks.Good luck."
271,Ajmer Dargah,"This is place of my Piro murshid Sarkar Hazrat Garib Nawaz R.A. I been to this place so many many times in my life, always my wish has full field here, again urs sharif starting here soon so I wished all there wishes will be full field again, as Salam walekum mere Piro murshid Sarkar Hazrat Garib Nawaz R.A. 👏👏👏🌹🌹🌹💐💐💐💐💐👏👏👏👏🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹"
272,Divine ,"Ajmer Sharif Dargah is 2 km away from the main central Ajmer Railway station and .5 km away from the Central Jail and is situated at the foot of the Taragarh hill, and consists of several white marble buildings arranged around two courtyards, including a massive gate donated by the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Akbari Mosque, built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. It contains the domed tomb of the saint."
273,Holy place ,"We visited the Ajmer Dargah Enroute to Pushkar. The Dargah was fully crowded and everybody we met on the way warned us about pick pocketing inside the Dargah. Hence, as  a general rule be careful with your belongings here.The car parking is quite far from the Dargah. One needs to walk in congested streets filled with shops and alms seekers. Both Hindus and Muslims consider this place holy and one can see the brotherhood of the two communities in this place.If you are on that route, it is worth a visit."
274,spiritual and holy place,"Ajmer is mainly known for the world famous holy shrine of khwaja Moinuddin ji Chisty besides the temple city of Pushkar , some 12 kilometres away. Devotees , including a large number of non Muslims throng here to seek blessings...throughout the year"
275,Messy and chaotic,"The shrine of sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti. The shrine consists of many tombs, courtyard and dalaan..   Ajmer railway station is just 2-3 km away. Bus stand Ghoogra ghat is a bit far but autos are available.  Although it is very crowded, just sit and regaining inert…"
276,holy place,It's a great experience to visit the dargah and offer prayers. I felt blessed after the visit. There were some qawwali's being sung and that was wonderful. 
277,First Dargah Visit,"Dargah Shariff is a religious site for Muslims and Hindus alike. It is associated with the Khawaja Moinuddin Chisti. Visit to Ajmer is incomplete without visiting this holy shrine. The architecture, aura and gathering of devotees create a magic like environment at the shrine. Tie thread, make a wish, or just listen qawaali there."
278,Faithful place,"I first went to the Dargah Sharif in Ajmer in 1999 when I was 14 and I must admit the place had a very strong impact on me back then. It's eight hours by road from Delhi so I think I should come here more often, but my last trip in August was only my fourth. I went on a Sunday afternoon which is a very good day and time to go to the Dargah to offer prayers. The last time I went was on a Friday afternoon and it was all too rushed due to the crowd presumably because it was Namaz time. So it was a relief to enter the Dargah on a Sunday when the crowd was more manageable. Moreover it allowed me to get more time in the two prayer areas which is precisely what I went there for. The other thing I liked compared to earlier visits was that we were allowed to click photographs and that was great. As for money, carry only what you need and leave your debit, credit cards behind if possible. I always love my visits to the Ajmer Dargah and this was no different. If the area surrounding it can get a facelift, then nothing like it."
279,Kwaja mere kwaja oo...,"I visited the holy Dargah Shariff in Ajmer in the last week of September 2017, and it was a memorable experience, despite the long walk to the entrance under the blazing afternoon sun and amidst the bustling bazaar area crowded by a million people. The dargah premises were remarkably clean and organized, given the huge number of people that visit it every day. The few minutes that a visitor is allowed inside the inner sanctum, in between the constant push from behind by the never-ending queue of visitors and the ushering away by the guards, are truly blissful and soul-stirring and will surely make you bow your head in respect, whether you are a believer or not. However, beware of the numerous beggars, pickpockets and other opportunists who are always ready to take advantage of the naive tourists."
280,Best place to visit ,From 5 th morning to 6 the evening. Dargah Khwaja Saheb. Tomb of Sufi Saint. Very serene place. Once inside the Dargah you get inner peace
281,Dargah Sharif,This is a Sufi Shrine which houses the tomb of Garib Nawaz - the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti. This 13th Century Shrine is very popular among people of all faiths who flock here in thousands with their families to pray and pay obeisense after fullfìllment of their prayers.…
282,masagener of god if you belive,It was Friday afternoon when we reached Ajmer on the way to Pushkar from Jodhpur. To much crowd. We came back from the gate as it was almost taking our breath due to too many people in such a small lane. with old people and kids its not recommend until you have some wish…
283,A must visit place,"It was my very first visit to the dargah of Gareeb Nawaaz . And I am glad I could . One of the most tranquil and peaceful place in India despite a lot of crowd within the huge premises. No wonder ,people from all over the world come to visit this shrine . One can offer flowers and cloth to the dargah . Of course there are many touts who will ask if you need help . Do not respond and just smile and move on . Lots of activities go on in the vicinity and a keen observer will just see and understand the interplay of religion ,emotions and human faith . A must visit in Ajmer"
284,Peaceful,"The Dargah of Moinuddin Chisti, a Sufi saint, is supposed to be a spiritual and holy place. Be prepared to deal with aggressive shopkeepers trying to sell you flowers and sheets (chaddars) as you enter the Dargah."
285,Dargah Sharif,"Make sure you know someone familiar before you enter this place, it's quite crowded and you might never be able to make to inner most area if you are not familiar."
286,A must visit place in Ajmer,This is one of the highest regarded shrine in India. Its tomb of Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti which started the Chishti order in India. Place has lot of good Spiritual energy and millions throng here every year to offer Fateh and do charity for the poor. Only Downside is the breed of Khadims who act like beggars and some are very aggressively Greedy and demand maximum money. I advice not to fall in their trap and ignore them. They have ruined the experience of the place for sure but they should be ignored. Only donate what your heart desires and can afford. Highly Recommended. This place is a must see.
287,Best in World ,"I visited this place again, this time with a friend who had never seen it.  Access to this shrine is through a very narrow lane, which is highly crowded and most of the time one has to walk nearly a kilometer to reach here.  Once inside, the scene is like any other religious…"
288,Special spiritual place,"I had the honour to visit the holy dargah Sharif at ajmer on Friday in urs mela. Before visiting , I did not know the occasion . But on reaching , I came to know the pious date. So the rush was very much , but heavy police arrangement was there to control rush . Ad it became 12…"
289,Ajmer Dargah,"We were covering Pushkar and Ajmer in one day. After finishing Pushkar, we travelled back to ajmer and went straight to the railway station. We kept our bags in the cloak room but if you plan to do so, make sure your bags are properly locked otherwise they do not allow to keep it in cloak room. We had couple of small trolley bags which we could not lock, hence had to carry it with us. We negotiated an auto for 50 but wanted it to drop us near the dargah gate but the driver mentioned that we should take the foot overbridge near the station gate and walk to the dargah, because we would need to keep our stuff in the cloak room on the way. The walk was through very narrow street from the clock tower and seemed never ending (may be because of the bags we were carrying and the outside heat). We got a hotel Arzoo palace on the way whose manager/owner was very nice and agreed to store our bags. Such a relief it was. We had some cold drinks on the way and kept checking on the stuffs on the street while we walked towards the dargah. We bought a chadar for 100 bucks on the way to be presented at the dargah. In front of the dargah, it is crazy crowd. Anyone can get overwhelmed by it. There were lot of maulana’s and they could easily understand that we have no idea where to go. It is not very intuitive as well. We bought some flowers for another 100 and also bought a handkerchief for 20 bucks, as both ladies and gents as well as kids have to cover their head. We also kept our shoes there at the flower shop. And even before we know, we were being guided by the maulana’s. We tried to follow the crowd but because of constant un-needed guidance, we kind of fell into the trap and were taken to an older maulana and asked to sit there while he read some prayers. What I could understand from his words is he was wanting us to commit to some hefty donation, to which I said No. They were not very happy and started scolding us. But nothing doing, I just went away from there and stood behind a queue which was heading into the dargah. They were still calling us but I just avoided eye contact with them. As you stand in the queue and get closer to the god, you start getting pushed by the huge crowd. We managed to give our chadar and flowers to the maulana inside, who just threw it onto the god and we put some money into the donation box and kept moving. Once we came out, there was no more pursuing by anyone and it was so relaxing. We sat there for some time and also saw the badi degh and choti degh on the way out. With the constant crowd flow and pushing and shoving, we were courageous enough to click couple of pictures in front of the dargah. There were lot beggars also in that place, which is quite natural for any such place. We took the same route back, as we had to pick up our bags. My wife bought some dresses and sarees and it was cheaper than Jaipur. Got some good quality bandhini dresses for 300 bucks. We picked our bags from arzoo palace and the owner was kind enough not to charge anything for keeping the bags there. We then had pure veg lunch at some place near the clock tower, bought another bag to keep our shopping stuff and went to the station to pick up our bags and wait for our train to Udaipur."
290,Abode of peace,"This is the Darga of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti; who was a Sunni mystic; and claimed his lineage back to Ali, the prophet's son-in-law. The place is quite crowded during the day, and there are a lot of beggars who will not leave you alone; best to keep ignoring them. Photographs are not allowed inside, so dont take any cameras with you. Also, vendors along the way will ask for money for various things, saying you cannot go inside the durgah without them. Ignore all this, and just keep walking. Inside, you may be asked for donations again; dont feel pressured to give anything. Area outside is quite busy; good for people watching"
291,Resting place of one of the most powerful sufi saint in India,Its a holy shrine of sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishty (R.A) who is also widely known as Gharib Nawaz.
292,Sufi experience,"No words can explain the experience. You have to be there yourself. It's upto you to hang on to one of the several helping hands who can take you around quickly or, you line up in the queue and take in the vibrations from the hustle and bustle around.It can be very crowded. Go mentally prepared. Cover up from top to bottom. That's important. No photography inside. Parking is far (I parked at Central junction). Take a rickshaw if you cannot walk for a kilometer.Worship the almighty, pay your respects and may God bless you."
293,World famous Dargah,In the ajmer city the holy Dargah sharif of khwaja moinuddin chusti is situated. In the month of August I visited this hotel with my family. After visiting this holy place I am feeling blessed. It is one of tourist attractions place of the ajmer.

295,Divine place,"From Sone ji ki nasiya, it takes 15 minutes walk to reach Ajmer Dargah on foot. Cars are not allowed but you can take an auto. Devotees from all religions visit this dargah. As usual in India, various shopkeepers will try to sell offerings but we ignored them and it is not much…"
296,Nice place ,Very famous Dargah of sufi saint Khwaja Garib Nawaj Moinuddin Chisti RA. Khwaja Sahab dargah is a right place to see communal harmony.
297,religious,"The tomb of Saint Moinuddin Chishti (died 1236 CE), the founder of the Chishti sect of Sufism, is one of the most revered spiritual site in the subcontinent, not only for the followers of Islam but also for every other religion.  Important things to take care of:  1. Keep your…"
298,Dargah,"The Dargah Sharif is a shrine to the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti. The shrine was built in the 13th century by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Even though it was a weekday when I visited, it was the place was packed with people wanting to pray at the shrine or provide offerings. I’m not one to ask for miracles, so the place wasn’t all that interesting to me. The shrine also feels very commercialised. The shrine and the adjacent mosque is filled with stalls selling flowers and other offerings.."
299,"Not Maintained, Quality of the place is Lost","Ajmer Sharif Dargah is also known by the name of Dargah Sharif, Khawaja Gharibnawaz Dargah Ajmer, Ajmer Dargah, Ajmer Sharif."
