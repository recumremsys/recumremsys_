0,It's nice,"What can you say? It's a monument of a ginger bread. A big one. It can be a bit crowded to get close, but people seems pretty polite.But going to Tula, it's a must see from the list."
1,Monument ,"It is just a monument.  You won't be able to eat it. It was erected not a long time ago.  It is hard to miss it, as everyone going to the Kremlin passes by it.  We stopped for a selfie, like everyone we saw on that day."
2,Cute Monument,I've seen different monuments and of course there should be the monument to Tula Pryanik (gingerbread). You have to make a picture with it =)
3,Rather unique subject matter,The monument itself is just a place for a must-have selfie. But young kids just love the fountain righ near the monument.  Be sure you've got some dry clothes beacause my son was wet all over:) There are also some nice cafes around. So it's a nice place to come after Kremlin and Samovar's museum.
4,One of Tula's pretty little monuments,Cute place to take some funny pictures. And quite close to many other places of interest in Tula. :)
5,A place to have a break with kids,"the museum is really small, though if there are not many people you can really enjoy it. Many cute samovars)) Unfortunately for us it was almost nothing visible because of people people people"
6,GIIIINGERBREAD Monument who else it can be,"I'm not sure anywhere needs a monument to gingerbread, but Tula is known for the stuff sooooo... you can buy gingerbread all over the city."
7,Just for a photo,"The monument is quite an easy to find, only a small walk from Tula Kremlin and along the road to the church. Gingerbread is one of the three things Tula is famous for, other two being arms and samovars. If you don't have time to visit the Gingerbread museum itself, just take a picture in front of the monument and buy some local gingerbread. Many parking options nearby."
8,Yay for Tula's gingerbread,"It's located near the Kremlin and only takes couple of minutes to come see. It portraits the traditional Tula pastry, usually translated as gingerbread (not the most accurate translation though. Russian word for this pastry is ""pryanik"") and looks like you could eat it."
9,very small but funny,"To be honest the statue is fine, and is no doubt meant to draw attention to one of Tula's renowned products. It is in itself rather plain, but the location with the shopping mall on one side, and the Lenin statue/government building facing it, puts it in a location to be seen. There are seats around it, and it is a pleasant enough spot to rest before moving on to look at the close by Tula Kremlin complex, or going for a spot of shopping."
