0,Very peaceful,This is a great place to visit. A very efficient ferry service takes you there. Runs every 10 minutes. Nice monument. Not ancient. Was built in the 20th century
1,Spiritual Place In Indian Ocean,"You will have to buy a ticket and then reach there by a short ferry ride, it's nice and worth visiting once."
2,kanyakumari footprints + vivekanand dhyan rock,We visited this place in December 2018. There is a big queue to get the entry tickets to the ferry that takes us to this rock memorial where you have to buy entry ticket again to go inside the memorial. Nothing phenomenal about this place except the history associated with this place. It is one of the tourist attractions in Kanyakumari.
3,General,You can reach this place by ferry. When we reached there it was very nice weather. Nice cold wind. Nothing much to see but you can enjoy the view and feel the peace.
4,Monument in the Ocean!,"It is nice to get there on one of the little ferryboats. When you get there on a holiday try to get VIP-tickets that are sold at a higher price at the ticket booth. The normal line is insane!When you get there it is nice to walk around, there are some shops offering religious material and don’t miss the meditation room."
5,AN EXCELLENT MEMORABLE  DAY-TRIP,Amazing place. You have to take the ferry to reach it . The line for the ferry was so long but well organized. The ferry cost INR 50. The ferry ride takes only 4 minutes. Then you have to buy another ticket INR 20 to enter the two temples. The sight is amazing. Inside the temple there are religious figures where devotees donate money. From this site you can also see the Thiruvalluvar Statue. Such awesome view. Not to be missed.
6,Serene,"This is another popular site and an attractive place to visit. One has to go there by a boat and must get on it before 4 pm. This was built in 1970 in honor of Swami Vivekanand with a belief that he attained enlightenment on this rock. View from distance is much better but it is recommended to also visit onsite to see the detailing, including a dhyan mandapan (meditation hall)."
7,Simply amazing!,"this was well worth the visit. the trip across is by ferry. The ferry is well maintained and safe, each traveller is issued with a safety vest, and the ferry has a capacity for seated passengers only. My tip is to go into the premier line and pay just a few rupees more to be…"
8,Vivekananda Rock at Kanyakumarika,We need to go by the ferry.Nice view of the seas and ocean the ferries are too frequent. Very peaceful calm and spiritual place. Well maintained and beautiful.
9,Vivekananda Rock Memorial,"You take a 5 min boat trip to the island. It was very windy on that day. The area is serene, you can see the nearby townships."
10,Beautiful,it is a small iland in the sea.you have to go by a steamer. it has got two main things to see.one is the temple where parvati worshipped lord shiva standing on one feet .the image of the feet is worshipped here.2nd is bibekananda temple.here inside the temple a big statue of…
11,Inspiring holy place,"You have to board a ferry from the jetty and approx. 5-10 min. sea ride to reach there. Its not like the ferry is overstuffed like most other places. But still, the ride is little bumpy and scary. Though you’re provided a life jacket. Once you reach there, its a completely different experience. Even in extremely hot and sunny afternoon, you have cool sea breeze to soothe you. However, the sheer force of the wind is something you probably wouldn’t have experienced before. You’d feel being pushed by the wind. So take care of your hairs, caps, dupattas and anything that could be blown away. Its not just the wind, even the sound of strong sea waves crashing the rock is mesmerising and frightening at the same time. The ground gets hot in the afternoon and you’re made to walk barefoot but thankfully they have painted a broad strip of ground White. You could walk comfortably on the painted floor. Historical importance notwithstanding, its just the sound of waves and pushing force of cool breeze that made the whole experience amazing. I just wonder how vivekanand ji swam through such violent sea waves.There is a temple and a vivekanand memorial to explore but I was more excited about enjoying the mother nature.You can spend as much time as you want as the ferries are continuously running to and fro."
12,A spiritual experience,"Visited this place in summer. Nice Place to Visit a ferry ride for 10-15 minutes is little difficult to get due to long queue  and local persons are trying to jump the queue and want to reach in front of ferry ride as the queue is too long. Again queue management is in sufficient.When you reach Rock Memorial your all the impetiance will be over you will fill cool, calm and peace everywhere. Three seas are merging around and you will fill the colors of the Magnitude and Diversity of the place. You will feel the thrill, 125 years ago in 1892 December 25 how Swami Vivekananda did meditation here in this this rock. I am really astonish & speechless when I was in Rock Memorial. Really the environment is excellent, incredible.  Nice books & presentation are available in very reasonable price in 06 books stalls. One thing you need to remember that you have to visit this Rock memorial and surrounding areas in barefoot. As I visited this place in first week of June during returning time, (around 11:30 am afternoon) we felt the heat in the floor of the memorial compound area. There is a special entry ticker for the ferry is also available for Rs.200/- per person to bypass the queue.It’s a lifetime achievement for anyone to see the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari."
13,Must Visit,"Nice place to explore in Kanyakumari. You have to take a boat to reach this place, per head charge Rs.20 or 25. Its better to go in the evening by around 4 to avoid hot sun. The boat jetty is close to the Bhagavathy Amman temple."
14,Interesting even for a non Hindus,Vivekanad Rock Memorial is Amazing. You can go their by ferries only. You can buy tickets. Lot of people visit this place. Aamzing experience.You can take your time exploring the place. Sit down at the meditation room and meditate for a while. Very well maintained.
15,Amazing place,Good place to visit with family. Ferry is available with charge of 50 per person to reach the rock Memorial. Also the timing is closing by 4.30 pm in evening. Childrens will enjoy the ferry ride and it's safe too.
16,Enjoy the ferry ride,"This is a place no one visiting kanyakumari should miss. You need to take a boat ride and usual timing starts from 08.00am, depending on sea conditions the timings will change. The date we visited the thiruvallor statue was closed due to low tide. The boat ride will cost 50rupees but the queues are quite long and tiring, you can avail special ticket of 200 rupees per person for boat ride, worth it. The rock is a nice place and another 20rupees entry fees is there. The place itself is nice, calm you can spend as much as time in peace."
17,Amazing experience,you need to go to see this place through a ferry. Lot of people standing in the queue for boarding the ferry. There is a provision of special ticket also. It is one of best monument one would ever see. A must visit
18,Wow place ..don’t have words,I recently traveled to this place with friend. One has to take ferry ride to reach there. The place is amazingly well maintained and usually crowded. One will get an breathtaking view of sea and nature from here. Must visit place in cape.
19,Main attraction in kanyakumari,"One has to travel by ferries run by TN government...the distance is very short, but the boat docking is very rough.The memorial is serene and well maintained. There is statue of Vivekanda in the main hallThere is a small meditation hall. Many book stall by the Kendra.There is time clock.Very good breezeLovely and serene place"
20,Well worth the short ferry ride,The place is a beautiful one. It is a must visit place when visiting South India. It is off the coast to Kanyakumari. One needs to avail a ferry service to reach here. Magnificent memorial.
21,"Good place, positive vibes",I have been there for an hour and it is a best tourist place in india an absolute holiday destination to visit
22,The humid breeze in morning 8:00,This is the last rock of our country. You have to reach this place through boat. Boat is very ordinary. View of city from this place is too good.
23,Swami Vivekananda Rock,Place is beautifully located. Have to go by ferry which charges 34/ per head. It's a 5 min ride. The ferry offloads there and takes people coming back. Architecture is marvellous. Can see the 2 seas and indian ocean surrounding you on three sides. Nothing to eat there. Toilets are available. Book shops are there. Thiruvalluvar statue is nearby on another rock which is 133 feet high. Must go place.
24,Fantabulous,The 2 islands are reached by a short ferry ride and definitely worth doing. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial has an impressive building in a unique setting.
25,Nice place,This rock memorial looks great from the shore. A boat ride is required to visit it with ticket fees about 70 Rs. Better to visit in the morning when it is not that sunny. It closes by 4 30 PM.
26,Southern tip of India,they take you to the memorial in a jetty boat crowded with locals and visitors. staff is rude. they charge 100 rs per person plus there is a entry fee of rs 20 per person on the memorial entrance. overall a decent place.
27,No ferry service due to bad weather,We spent time during summer and please avoid the place during summer. It is hot and ferry takes longer for transportation.  Older ad young children should avoid during summer. Not much to see.
28,Peacefully beautiful windy,Going to and fro to this place is a big headache considering the huge number of tourists and limited boats. Better go for the costly ticket (Rs 200) to avoid queues. Once you reach the place its a good place to be. View is excellent.
29,"More than religious importance , a place of national heritage !",After a very long gap of over 30 years i visited this place. Ferry services with Rs50 and Rs200 tickets are provided by Poompuhar ferry corporation . Hardly 7 minutes trip to the place. 60 to 90 minutes required to go around the place and enjoy the cool sea winds with waves…
30,An amazing place - kanyakumari / Vivekananda Rock Memorial,You need to take ferry ride here. There are options like 50 Rs per head with long queue and 200 per head with direct entry. Entire place is very clean and well maintained. There is a mediation hall and I loved it. Also the view from the rock and feeling you get to stand on last piece of land on the south most part of india is awesome. Those who follow principles of Swami Vivekananda this place is much more.
31,Visit to vivekananda rock ,"One needs to complete a boat ride, which is thrilling, to reach this rock memorial. No food is allowed, drinking water is available. There is a hall for meditation. Books and other souvenirs can be bought from the shops. Have to wait 2-3 hrs during holidays to get into the boat."
32,Not to miss place in kanyakumari,"Must visit this place , very relaxing and rejuvenate , please provide more boat services, when you come back from vivekanda rock please provide special entrance to special ticket clients"
33,Superb,Vivekanand Rock is a must visit in your life time. One person has to take boat or ferry service to reach the Vivekanad rock. You will feel a certain kind of calm once you reach this place. You can visit the place where Vivekanand did his mediation. Must go place.
34,Awesome experience,Very well maintained and must visit place in Kanyakumari. The ferry is the only option for commuting.
35,"An interesting, short visit",You have to take a steamer ride (rs. 50 per head) to visit this place. Heavy winds flow all the time on the memorial. Very well maintained and peaceful serenity. Love with the place
36,Land mark of India... ,Nice place to visit during Kanyakumari trip. The views are amazing from this place. There's a meditation hall at the memorial which provides silent room to meditate.
37,Rock Memorial,A boat ride of 10 minutes from Kanyakumari boat stand to this amazing rock.Very high tides and velocity of air.Nice meditation 🧘‍♂️ hall and a temple. Nice view of sea 🌊.
38,BEAUTIFUL,"go by boat, what an experience, beautiful, stunning. an experience that is a must in this town. wow, wow ,wow"
39,Amazing place,you have to take a boat ride to reach this temple. it is huge. i don't know how they managed to built it but this is one of the amazing place and experience you should have in your list if you are going to kanyakumari. the line for boat is huge so plan accordingly.
40,REFRESHING AND AMAZING,"If you travelling down south in India, this is the farthest one can go. Take a boat ride to visit the Vivekananda rock memorial. Enjoy a roller coaster boat ride as the sea ia always choppy here. Next to it is the Kanyakumari temple."
41,beautiful feeling,"We had visited the place on a weekday but during vacation time. The line for the ferry was so long and took over 2 hrs to get tickets. The Vivekananda memories itself is nice, serene and cal but the ferry experience marred the whole outing."
42,Just peace and calmness ,"Certainly worth the boat ride to visit this memorial, the backdrop is stunning and it’s also lit up at night. Don’t go when it’s raining! It’s slippery and there is not much shelter to get out of the rain with the hoards."
43,"Great place, unique location",You can reach this place by Boat If you go early then you can see sunrise form this place.Place is very clean & peaceful
44,Divine,"This iconic place in TN is a great place to visit. The rock memorial in the sea can be reached by a motor boat operated by TN government for a round trip of 50₹. Depending on the crowd waiting time can be considerable and plan accordingly trip timings. The memorial is a peaceful place with all round oceanic views and Kanyakumari shoreline. A statue of Vivekananda inside the memorial and a silent meditation hall, a Parvathi footprint temple and a library,museum and book shops are located in the premises"
45,Superb destination for travelers,Good place to visit once. Excellent island. Well trained staff on shore to reach the island through boat.
46,The southern tip of India,"Its a short ferry ride to this place. But actually, you don't have anything to do at this spot apart from clicking pictures. Yes, the view is mesmerizing and this place has a story to tell but that doesn't justify the whole environment. Meditation hall will not give you that calmness as people are moving very frequently. the temple is all modern now and doesn't give you much of spiritual feel.  Long ques sometime to board the ferry and even getting its ticket. Overall, was not up to expectation."
47,Serenity at its best,A very calm and serene place with blue waters and cool sea breeze. The meditation hall in the place is worth checking out. It gets illuminated in the morning and is great to look at with sunrise.
48,Rocking with family on Vivekananda rock.,Very nice place to visit for all persons.Nice place for photography.Nice view of deep blue 3 sea.Must visit place.
49,Nice! ,"An extremely inspiring and exciting place,including the short boat ride in the sea..this is a must visit historic land mark in kanyakumari.."
50,Must See,"This place is very peaceful. The journey towards this place is good and when you reach here, it's magical. You are surrounded by water all across."
51,Mind blowing breeze..,The ferry is 50 rupees per person. The ride is fine and everyone is given a life jacket even though the boat ride is very short.The memorial costs 20 rupees a person. It is quite pretty but a little dull. Not that much to see after a short walk around and through the building.
52,Average,"You need to but Rs.50 ticket per person for ferry which will take you to the memorial. These ferries are very dangerous cause there are very old and not at all maintained. Staff are untrained and ill spoken.Once you reach the memorial, you need to buy another ticket worth Rs.25 per person to enter the memorial hall. Nothing special I could write on but please be very careful while on ferry."
53,beautiful view,Ferried by launch. Beautiful and scenic place. The extraordinary sight of the sea from the place is the highlight.  The main memorial is great with explanation coming from the guard inside. The place is discipline and memorable. There are tickets which are nominally priced. Don't miss it
54,Best Memorial,We visited this place in end Nov. 2019. It is a very amazing place. The views are excellent. Sun Rise and sun set are very attractive.The meditation room is too good.  Like to visit this place again.
55,Must watch,What a place. Very spiritual and attractive. One can spend entire day here. We spent 2-3 hours but were not enough
56,Really beautiful and relaxing place,"Beautiful place. Definitely a mush visit place. Only problem is, there will be long queue for the entry. We tried special ticket option (costs Rs.200 instead of Rs.50 for general) and did not have to wait too long."
57,Once in a lifetime spot,This place is really beautiful and ride on the boat to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial was really good. must to be seen by all . Only we did not get a chance to visit Thiruvallar Statue close by.
58,Fabulous place at the confluence of three seas,"We are so disappointed that the day we visited, there was high tide and heavy wind so they cancelled the ferry services. So we saw it from shore. The Thiruvallur statue is a Marvel and a big respect paid to the legendary poet. We can see the joining point of three oceans there. The sea shore is full of garbage and thrash which we don't like. There are so many street vendors but the issue is they keep on coming and disturb us. A superb photography point , but need a big amount of maintenance. There are no good restaurants near by so it's better to take some snacks in handy.Being December the sky is full of clouds so there is no sunset view or sunrise. To see it best months are March to May."
59,Serene place to visit ,Visited it in Feb 2019. Ride to the memorial is adventurous as we faced high tides and thus extra care has to be taken of kids. Awesome place with a great view of the Kanyakumari town. A beautiful and peaceful place to spend good time. One must also visit Kanyakumari Temple.
60,South most tip of mainland India,Wow it’s nice place. You  can spend couple of hours there. Best time to go there ke morning after that sun is too harsh and you can’t stand few minutes outside.Ferry will take 5-7 mins and ferry charges are 50 Rs per person (Round Trip )Very clean and well maintained place. Food is not allowed there.
61,Beautiful place.,We visited last year at Vivekananda temple.It is in the middle of sea. We were excited to go by steamboat there. We wear lifeguard jackets and then sit in steamboat. In 15 minutes we reached there. We were surprised to see the place . Neat and clean well maintained. I love the place Vivekananda statue is very tall and beautiful and i was again surprised when we know about it .It is made of single rock . There was a yoga an meditation centre also. Nice place I enjoyed very much.
62,Greate Vivekananda,"AMAZING place to visit in kanyakumari. we Stayed at OCEAN HERITAGE HOTEL and had a great time to see this place, we enjoyed a lot here. great boat service."
63,Beautiful and peaceful,Four of us took the ferry boat out to the memorial.Interesting and well worth the visit.Great views of the Kanyakumari shoreline.
64,"Kanyakumari, Sri Vivekananda Memorial island","This was a childhood hope to touch the endpoint of south India. Ferry service charge you only Rs 20 per person from Kanyakumari. You get to see Vivekananda Mandapam and huge Thiruvalluvar Statue, the famous poet of south. Vivekananda reached here and stayed for 3 days doing Yoga and Dhyanam just before his departure to USA for Chicago conference of World Religion."
65,Nice Spot for half day picnic,This place has A huge statue of Vivekananda inside the memorial building.You have to take a boat ride to reacht the island.Boat ride cost ₹50/person & entry is ₹20/personYou can sit there and spend as much time as you want however guards will come and ask you to leave if you wait or sit in a place for a very long time as there are other tourists also coming in and they dont want the places to be crowded
66,A historical landmark,It felt so nice to be there. Its so calm and serene. One could sit here for hours and see waves hitting the rocks from all sides. Amazing feeling to be there.
67,Vivekananda Rock Memorial,The place is well maintained and excellent for photography. One can easily spend up to 1 hr at this place. The best time to visit this place would be early morning or evening
68,Good Landmark,"If you visit Kanyakumari, your trip is not finished without seeing this beautiful monument. You need to get here by ferry and on the day we went, there was not much crowd.It could take about 3-5 hours depending on one's interest to see the memorial."
69,Vivekanand Rock,The boat journey to the island from the main land is very systemetic and disciplined.The all round natural view of the sculpture on the sea is a life time experience. The meditation room will facilitate to practice the same at own establishment.People should refrain from spreading eatables and plastic around the rock. Overall it was a wonderful lifetime experience.
70,A Memorable Place,The memorial is situated on a rock island almost 500m away from the sea banks.To reach there one has to take a few-minute long ferry ride.I had read so much about the super long queues here that had already decided to take a premium ticket to avoid the crowd.But for the ferry at…
71,lot of rush and less peaceful,Very nice place for visiting along with your family as it serves both adventure and religious purposes. View of Indian ocean satisfies one's adventurous zeal and temple of Swami Vivekananda provides great peace of mind. One can enjoy peaceful meditation here. Also one can purchase religious texts pertaining to Swami Vivekananda. Overall it is a great place to visit.
72,Breath taking view,This memorial and the statue on the rock next to it are part of the same ferry ticket. There are beautiful views of the coast and out to sea. The memorial itself it a very impressive structure and worth seeing up close.
73,Vivekananda rock memorial,Beautiful place in the middle of the  seas.... Wonderful atmosphere.. you can clicks some nice pictures... Must seen place at least you should have been there once in your life
74,Memory of Vivekananda,"Awesome experience in visiting this place, particularly the boat ride was excellent and the place was beautifully maintained even though there are thousands of visitors flood in a day."
75,Kanjakumari - Rock Memorial,"This is a tourist attraction solely and very professionally managed by the goverment authority. From the ticket counter to the embarkment at the rock memorial every step is catered in a hassle free manner. To and fro ferry costs 50/- per person. Although the waiting time is generally 45 mins to 1hr, there's good seating arrangement in the waiting area. While boarding the vessel, life vests are provided for the short journey of 5-10 mins. After alighting, one needs to buy entry ticket for 20/-. There are three things to visit, the Parvati Mandapam, Vivekananda Mandapam and. Meditation hall. The best time to visit is the early hours but the crowd is also too large. Photography is strict prohibited inside the mandapams.  Food is not allowed but insensible visitors are found to munch on titbits. There's drinking water facility but no eateries. And this is the best way to keep the rock and it's surroundings clean. This is such a beautiful place to sit and meditate that time flies. The last ferry to the rock memorial is at 4 pm and return ferry is at 5 pm.It is also recommended to view the evening sight of the memorial and adjacent Thiruvalluvar statue both of which are beautifully illuminated throughout the night."
76,Never miss,"To reach the memorial, you need to book ticket from the nearby counter for boating.In the rock memorial, you will find Swami Vivekananda statue inside. As the story says, Vivekananda meditates here for lon duration before going Chicago,America. So the memorial is dedicated to…"
77,Kanyakumari ,It’s really good place to visit with family.. you can see 3 different sea from this place.. I hope it’s very rare.. clean & good place.. you have to go in boat for just 10 mins
78,It's a end point of the India country,visited 2days back.no great rush for tickets.50rs for to and fro journey.boat spacious.life jacket for all.ferry ride really exciting on the wavy sea....back journey also no much waiting time.no stop at thiruvalluvar statue.waiting area for tickets has side benches.so don't miss…
79,Scenic Place inside the Sea,Amazing Place and don't miss this boat ride to Vivekananda Rock Memorial if you are visiting to Kanyakumari. Make sure you have this place on you do list of must visit list. They will ask you watned Rs 50 or Rs 200 for the boat ride and I would go with Rs 50 and there is not special with Rs 200 becaues everyone will have to wait for same boat.
80,Nice tourist place ,"Awesome place to visit. There is a meditation hall, book shops with different languages, the Hall with swami Vivekananda statue is very peaceful. One have to go by ferry."
81,Wow just superb,"Breath taking view of the ocean.Inside the mandapa very calm and quite environment. The ferry ride to the memorial is great,You won't feel to move from that place, feels like spending the entire day sitting and relaxing."
82,Best place to relax,"Amazing place to spend time with God, family and friends. The temple and the memorial beckon you to stay there forever. Sight and sound of the continuous waves, the pleasant breeze and the availability of all the basic facilities (water, washrooms) make this visit a memorable one"
83,lot of dan patras to loot the public anyhow.,"Not so peaceful and calm place. Locals visit quite often and shout aloud all around, still some learning about the great visionary."
84,Awesome,A must visit spot with family. Enjoy the boat trip followed by the beautiful view and peaceful ambiance of the monument. Don't miss a small session in the meditation hall which will show you path towards inner happiness and peace of mind. Enjoyed every moment....
85,Nice Place - Lifetime Achievement,"The place is very calm besides the amount of tourist and locals who flocks here, you get a sense calm and stress free feeling. There is nothing to shout about at the place as a whole but knowing history and visiting the place is something you have to do. A 1 time visit place."
86,enjoy the spiritual views.....,"A ferry ride of approx 500mts take you to this rock solid memorial of great Vivekananda . Ferry ride though is not the most comfortable and is just too crowded but when you reach the memorial then you realise the worth of this trip . The memorial also has a temple and place to relax and witness the serene sea where strong winds keep you refreshed . Though the place is hot but still you have places where you can walk barefoot , as these places are painted and is colder than the other parts of the floor . The memorial building is on a big rock and has learnings of Great Vivekananda . There are book sjops frpm where you can buy some memorabilia."
87,Superb experience,"Its amazing place at the seaside. Rising Sun & Sun set is unbelievable, This is really a Goddess place."
88,AMAZING PLACE,One of the best spiritual place I have ever visited. Very peaceful. Totally awesome. !The safety standards should be more strictly followed while crossing the channel.
89,Rejuvenate refreshing worth to visit again ,Vivekanand Rock Memorial is well managed place with very frequent motor boat service. A very educative and informative place. One should not miss spending few minutes in ground floor Meditation Hall in serene environment. A well stocked book store on Swami Vivekanand and…
90,a must visit in kanyakumari,"This trip is done on an oversized steamer even though the distance is barely 10mins. The steamer has a seating capacity of 60people but they stuff it with almost 120%capacity. The Thiruvaroor statue is almost always skipped from the itinerary. But once you reach the memorial, the view is breathtaking. It's nicely maintained with 360 degree view of the water (Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean)"
91,"Quite scary boat trip, but exciting nonetheless!",Must visit site.Take boat ride in the sea to reach the memorial of Swami Vivekananda built on a rocr in the sea.A nice place to walk around the huge statue.Takes 2 hours
92,Vivekananda Rock,"It was an excellent and unmemorable tour. We covered worth seeing places like Kanyakumari Amman temple, Vivekananda rock memorial, Povar back water, Kovalam beach, Ananta padmanabha swamy temple, Sucheendram temple, Saibaba temple, Sun set and Sun rise, Triveni sangam etc. Overall it is a very good experience."
93,good sea view,"You need to take a ferry which will cost you Rs 50 per head, after reaching again you need to pay Rs 20 per head for getting entrance ticket. Place is really good and well maintained. There will be a long line if for the ferry service if you are visiting on weekends. "
94,Good,"Located at the southernmost point of mainland India, provides a very good view of both sunrise and sunset. Such a serene place. Very cleanly maintained. Approach is through 5 minutes boat ride which costs 50₹ and special ticket costs 200₹. You get to jump the queue while going but no special services on return. Boat accommodates almost 100 people. Superb one of the best places to visit at Kanyakumari. It's an island where cool breeze flows throughout the day, you just need to sit in an shaded area. You won't like to move from that place, feels like spending the entire day sitting and relaxing. It gives you a peace of mind and relaxes your body.There is a meditation hall inside it and visitors can meditate there. Inside the meditation hall, the only sound is of OM.. and it's a good experience."
95,A must-see!,"The Vivekananda memorial is in a huge rock island just 500 meters from the shore . There is a ferry service which runs continuously to ferry people.As a visitor who has made multiple visits at different months, time of day, weather conditions, your experience may vary from just another overrated, overcrowded tourist place to an awesome experience depending upon when you visit. Recommend to visit during a weekday morning (when there are no school holidays) for best experience.Would like to split the review/experience into the Ferry service & Memorial. Ferry Service : All throughout the walk way/road leading to the ferry ticketing place is commercialized. It is 50Rs for normal ticket/person & 200 for VIP ticket (just lets you skip the queue to get the tickets during crowded days). During holiday season the wait time at the queue can be as high as 3-4 hours to get the tickets (standing in the sun) and wait for the Ferry. The ferry ride is a great experience, very bumpy and scary. Just to get in and out of the ferry itself seem dangerous when the tides are rough. Unnecessary rush by people at times to get a window side seat. Ferry doesn't operate if the tides are high. The life jackets provided are dirty. Funny to see each one is handling it the way they like. Memorial Rock : There is an entry fee (20Rs). Also, You have to deposit your foot wears to the caretaker at the entrance and walk bare foot all around. The rock can get very hot in the afternoons, though there are places where there is a layer of painting done to keep it cool. The memorial rock has multiple halls (Mandapam as it is called) Vivekananda mandap/hall has his life sized statue. The Shripada mandap has a foot print on the rock (behind a closed enclosure in the middle of the hall), supposed to be of a Goddess. And a Dyana Mandap for meditation where there is great silence and OM being chanted continuously. The outer areas give a great view of the seas (remember this place is the junction of the 3 seas (Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea). The view of the sea waves crashing at the rocks are awesome. The cool breeze and strong winds gives an amazing feel. There are decks to see the sun rise and sun set, the sun calender is etched in a granite pedestal. Excellent photo ops all around. Great view of the Thiruvalluar (Tamil Saint Poet) statue (133 feet) in the nearby rock island. All these great experience may go for a toss when there is too much crowd and noise/rush around. There are couple of shops to buy any memorabilia/books.  Carry water if you are not used to drinking from the public water taps. There is toilet/rest rooms available. One can spend as much time as possible at this place and the ferries run continuously till the closing time 6 PM IST. There can be queue/wait times for ferry return too. Have an awesome experience !"
96,Very Nice,A great place to be with family. Really enjoyed each and every corner. Beautiful views with boating.
97,With family ,"It was my second visit to this place.Relaxing breeze,soothing atmosphere in the middle of sea. The ferry ride is also an exciting part. But do plan to be present there as early as possible or else be prepared to stand in long queue.Sometimes i just wonder how did the great Swami Vivekananda managed to swim this far into the sea."
98,Good place. Fantastic view,"DO NOT MISS this great place if you are in kanyakumari. After standing in the long line of tourists , we finally reached the jetty where the boat took our family across the high tide heavy current waters to reach swami vivekananda rock memorial , we took many photos and selfies…"
99,GOOD PLACE FOR MEDITATION,This is one of its kind which is in the mid of sea in Kanyakumari. I like the place as I love water. The ferry opens at 8 am .
100,Vivekananda rock memorial ,"Visited the memorial in mid August. It's a must do if one is in Kanyakumari.Tips:1) Take the 200 Rs ticket and skip the queue while heading to the memorial. The queue can get really long on weekends.2)The water can be fairly rough so the ferry ride (although short) may not be smooth. The ferry keeps shaking even when it's docked so boarding, alighting can be a challenge if traveling with small kids or elderly"
101,Epic memorial ,Built in 1970 and just off the shore accessible by ferry boat. This temple still memorial is beautiful and has a very peaceful meditation room. It really is a must see.
102,Must Visit,It's always memorable to visit this divine place. Has been going there since my college days and it is always pleasant to be there. A feast for eyes and mind.
103,Excellent place,This is the finest place in Kanyakumari and one can spend most of the time here only as nothing much is there to visit in Kanyakumari. It is MUST Visit.
104,Shoeless & hot hot!,Very calm place. One can do meditation in meditation room and buy books related to Swami Vivekanand from there.
105,Picturesque,"A place where u can mediate ,surrounded by sea ,very breezy ,One has to board fiery to reach there and to go back to destination"
106,Very Nice view,Very Nice place to Visit as the same built in the sea near to sore... also have Swami Vivekanand Memorial and Tiruvullar Statue and very clean and maintained place.
107,Wow what an experience,"The location and the views are so breathtaking that its undoubtedly one of the best places to go. The view of Indian ocean, Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea merging together can clearly be identified here. All three waters have different colour. The wind is so strong and waves are so high that it creates a thrill as well. After taking the to and fro tickets for the boat, you take the boat ride to the memorial which is hardly 5 minutes in sea. On other side you can see the tall memorial and feel the breeze. Overall environment is just serene. Meditation room is also good for a short experince before returning back. One to two hours is good for this visit."
108,Visit to this place an unforgettable experience for lifetime,"this memorial is built very nicely. It looks even beautiful from the shore..the only thing that is frustrating is the ferry that is used to go to this memorial.. The boat jetty is so crowded with long queues and then the crowded boat. But after all that the place is really good. Serene, But in summers the floor is so hot,so better keeps your socks on :)"
109,Descent location with a significance of Southern point with three oceans merging at one point,"A place worth visiting if you are in Kanya Kumari or any nearby area. Everything, starting from the Queue for the Launch journey, to the arrangements for visitors on the Memorial is well managed and disciplined.The Statue of Swami Vivekananda is on the top of the Rock and presumably Swamiji received enlightment after meditation on this rock in December 1896.The Parvati Temple on the Rock Memorial is said to have the footprint of Goddess Parvati, when she came to the Earth as a 'Kanya' (Virgin Lady) to solicit courtship with Lord Shiva."
110,The highlight of the trip,"Must for anyone visiting Kanyakumari. Getting a ticket after standing in a long waiting queue is difficult but ince you have the ticket then the experience is worth. The normal ticket queue was quite long but the special ticket queue was not small even. Holiday season needs to be avoided. The massive waves makes the ferry ride even more interesting. One can imagine the power and strength of Sri Vivekananda ji, who made is way by swimming from shore that rock. The place was very clean and well maintained. Must for all and highly recommended."
111,A great place,"Perfect place in kanyakumari to spend some quality time. But, make Sure u come with sun glasses and Hat. It's scorching heat even at 8:00 Am. I sat there ideally and felt good. Njyd Cool breeze. "
112,Southern tip of India,"Only issue is the Q for the boat ride. IF you want to take special line, its just a waste, better take the normal Q which moves faster. Once in the boat there is no differentiation."
113,"Vivekananda Rock, Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu","Vivekananda memorial rocks can be reached by ferry service only. The view of conjunction of 3 seas Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean and Arabian sea is mind blowing. Other places of attraction on the rock is a temple, meditation Hall and book store."
114,Amazing experience ,Excellent location located close to Kanyakumari city in a small island. In addition to boat fee there is entry fee to the Vivekananda Rock memorial.The whole place was very clean and well maintained. Crowd is an issue so try going early or in afternoon close to evenings. Both those times we noticed less people in the queue.
115,A fantastic mandir of ICONIC personality,"We have to reach rock through ferry from land which costs INR 50 to and fro plus INR 20 to visit the memorial inside. Rock completely surrounded by sea. Best part is from the rock we can see Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean and Arabian sea which is just beautiful. What we can see is pure blue waters until the end also peace and calmness. Inside the memorial huge statue of Swami Vivekananda is there where he meditates during his visit. There is also meditation room down the memorial which is pure divine.There is stone board which tell us life journey of Swamiji and Memorial right infront of meditation room.Best to visit before afternoon as it gets hotter. But in the morning there will be big queue for ferry but it moves fast as it takes only 5 minutes to reach the rock. Must to do in Kanyakumari."
116,Great Experience on Vivekananda Rock Memorial,"The memorial is located at a very beautiful location, which about 500 meters away. Ferry ride is available at very nominal prices. The queue tends to be long and boring. Once you get on the Rock, it is a different experience. You can experience the force of nature."
117,Sight seeing,"On Kanyakumari beach, we took tickets priced @ Rs 20/- per person for ferry ride to Vivekananda Rock memorial in the cape comorin. Vivekananda Rock memorial is open from 8 am to 6 pm. We enjoyed the ferry ride on the wavy motion of sea. People took photos of the lovely place with blue water.Vivekananda Rock memorial is the place which gives silence and devotion to self and then connects with the God and this world.Sitting in the premise itself is the loving part of journey.Wind turbines in the sea and cool breeze fills with immense happiness."
118,Vivekananda rock memorial,The ambience is awesome very well maintained. However the journey could have been much more improved with facilities for senior citizens and faster movement of queues by providing more jetties..
119,A monument of rich value,I don't have enough word to explain the beauty and value of Vivekanada Rock. Boating service available from kanyakumari. 20 rupees ticket need by in the rock.it will take around 1 hour to visit the complete area. Don't miss the meditation room and obviously the beauty  of ocean. 
120,Amazing,It is always good to learn about Vivekananda. Good and calm place in the sea and inspiring to learn that Vivekananda did tapsya here more than 100 years before.
121,"A real wow, great place","Great place to visit wind blowing is awesome,  you can spend 3 hours travel from beach to Rock memorial approximately 10 minutes,  Sun rise view is just awesome here"
122,tribute to a great man,It is best place of Kanyakumari not to be missed at any cost.Stay 1-2 days herewith family for long time sweet memory.
123,Must visit and do meditation for few minutes ,Very very Good Feeling this place is very good for visit an amazing place good for photographers thank you
124,Must visit place....,"Surrounded by oceans this small rock will give you positive vibes and calmness. And, moreover it feels great to put a check-in from the last point of India !"
125,Must visit place,"Calm, neat and well maintained place. We have traveled in ferro-boat for 5 mins and reached memorial. We also got chance to watch the sunset from here."
126,What a place,"summary:day1: 10hr drive with very nice roads and sunset point visitday2: kanyakumari temple darshan, ferry ride and vivekananda rock, trisea sangam point, Padmanabhapuram Palace, Sothavilai Beachday3: sunrise, Vattakottai Fort, rameshwaram drive of 5 hours and famous Ramanathaswamy temple darshanday4: Ramar Patham darshan, dhanushkodi beach point, Panchamukha hanuman temple darshan, Dr APJ Abdul kalam memorial visit, Villoondi Tirtham, khushi beachday5: drive back to bangalore recently we did trip  from bangalore to kanyakumari to rameshwaram and back, as our plans of going to kerala on the extended long weekend were washed away in the floods. though its a really long drive, if you pace it out, its very enjoyable, even with kids, but would need like 5 days atleast to do justice to the 660+ km drive.we started out early morning, 6 am, and could really beat the bangalore traffic, though the toll plaza was already seeing a crowd (btw its a royal wastage of time and money (for fuel burnt) and just filling up someone's pocket, as the broken roads of bangalore dont deserve any toll for the few km its motroable). in comparison the roads of TN are like butter, you can easily do 120-130 without even noticing - awesome roads all the way till Kanyakumari. Though the toll is 710 rs (more than re a km) and all intersections in some cities have barriers to slow you down. with a couple of pit stops for breakfast, lunch, we still made it in approx. 10 hrs.the sunset is awesome, and after taking short rest in hotel, we went to sunset point, which was 2km away, since we reached 30min early, easy parking and could enjoy the area before actual sunset. came back and had dinner at sarvana hotel (pricey and not much tasty btw) and retired for the day.interesting part is folks all over the visit speak hindi so fluently, that sometimes i had to remember the hindi words :), business teaches everyone all the languages...wanted to go to see the sunrise, but too tired and did not wake up on time for the 6.12 am sunset. whole family took bath and set off for darshan at Bhagavathy Amman Temple, which is walkable from our hotel, we had a very good darshan in the special queue (though temple was empty the folks pushed us to that entrance), Goddess nosepin is so shiny it will blind you. Men will be asked to remove shirt/banyan in inner portion of temple.returned for breakfast and changed to shorts and tshirt and set off for ferry ride to vivekananda rock. ticket is 50rs pp, even kids above certain height, but crowd was less so no wait, ferry fills in few hundred or so folks and there are 2-3 rotating, probably when crowded. ferry takes like 10min (most of it is parking time) to reach vivekananda point. its a pity they dont go to thiruvalluvar statue rock or that both rocks should at least be linked..nice views at the rock, it gets hot, so take some pics and headed back. walked to the trisea sangam, another 5-10 min walk after having lot of coconut water, took few pics and admired the 3 colours of the oceans (Indian ocean, Bay of bengal, Arabian sea) and it got quite hot, so had lunch and headed back for rest.since it was too hot and Temples are closed till 3/4pm, we headed off to Padmanabhapuram Palace first, rather than Thanumalayan temple - Sthanumalayan Kovil, google showed an hour, but traffic was high and few road stoppages, meant we took additional 40min. This wooden palace is really awesome, it looks small but its huge inside. we had to remove footwear and kept on walking for more than an hour to cover it. each room has a person who can talk in multiple languages to explain the significance. we were tired in the end, had snacks and decided toskip Mathur aqueduct, as i did not feel like driving more.we headed to Sothavilai Beach, which is on the way back for us, and about 10km from the kanyakumari beach and we reached there in an hour. the beach is nice, empty (hardly saw 1 or 2 folks till eye could go), but the tides/waves are very strong, so we just ran little bit in water, played around for some time.in the evening went to ""delhi punjabi dhaba"" - there are several punjabi ones, so note the name, the north indian food, which kids were missing now, was awesome, great service, very nice buttermilk..then we shopped around for shells products..with decent bargaining ofcourse.next morning at 6 stepped out on foot to see the sunrise, 10min walking distance and reached just on time to see the 6.15 awesome sunrise, with quite a crowd - some viewing from hotel roof. had breakfast, packed and setoff at 8.30 to Vattakottai Fort, in 10min we came to empty fort, its a small one, very neat and clean and AWESOME views of the ocean, we sat on the wide walls and took selfies and enjoyed the ocean view before driving off to Rameshwaram.5 hours or so, we reached the hotel, had lunch, packed up in preparation for the 22 well bath and darshan of the famous  Ramanathaswamy temple. Please read my review there to get the details, else this one will become multi-page :)went around the temple, had dosas and retired for the day.after sumptuous breakfast, we headed first to Ram Padam (ramar patham) shrine from where Lord Ram started his journey for Lanka. its the highest point and so views are nicethen we headed off to dhanushkodi, its awesome with ocean on both sides and the narrow road in between, at the end is where we can park car and go to the ocean. there is also a nice temple in between.we then headed to Panchamukha hanuman temple, where kids got to see the floating stones, which looked to be huge corals, but float well on water. on the same road back to pamban bridge is Dr APJ Abdul kalam memorial, must see for all, he is a role model, a president to set an example to others, no words to describe such a great man, and hte memorial does justice by showcasing his pictures, medals, belongings etc a km away is Villoondi Tirtham (sweet water well in ocean) where legend has it that lord Rama shot an arrow in ocean to quench Sita's thirst. there is deep well and very nice ocean front.we then headed to Khushi/Ariyaman beach, which was slightly crowded but such a calm ocean with gentle slope, kids really had royal fun here as its like a huge swimming pool. we were done early evening with sand all over..worst part is the drive back to bangalore, when you know in advance that it will take 2+ hours from the last toll plaza to home on a rainy sunday evening with broken roads..so much disappointed with the roads in bangalore and apathy towards fixing. it took 11 hours from hotel to home...althought the distance was ~570 km"
127,You will love this place,We had a great vacation in Kerala. So we decided to visit Kanyakumari (the last point of India). We traveled 5 hrs from Trivendrum to stand in a long queue. Fortunately got VIP boat entry tickets to go to Vivekananda rock in afternoon. It hardly took us 30-45 mints to explore…
128,"Vivekananda Rock Memorial, a must visit","A good place but if you do not come in line before sunrise (around 6:30 am) it is very hard to get to go in the ferry fast. If you are late you will have to take a special ticket (₹200 instead of₹50for a normal ticket), by 8:00 you will at least have to stay in line for an hour. After you reach the rock memorial, gain information take a look around and then ask them to take you to the museum on the island if it is open it charges about₹20.It is a nice place and would recommend"
129,Amazing,Serene and calmIt is an ultimate experience to sit and experience the area. The winds blowing across yours face is refreshing experience. It is one those places one has to be when there are less people around. It is clean and well maintained.
130,"Well kept, well organised.","I was feeling very energetic after visiting the rock memorial, it is very beautiful and historic palace."
131,exellent,1. Very peaceful calm and spiritual place. 2. Well maintained and guarded. 3. You may want to take special tickets to boat for saving queue time which can be utilized in visiting other places or spending more time here. 4. I could not go to thiruvallur statue due to low tide.…
132,Beyond the Complement ,The place where swamy Vivekananda swimto meditate in the caves and is accessed by a ferry.   In seasons the place is really crowded. The ferry ride takes just 10 minutes and you have option of 55 Rs or 250 Rs tickets to go..  The rock memorial has goddess Kanyakumari foot…
133,picturesque,"The visit to Vivekananda rock memorial was very pleasant thanks to the way it's organised. You line up at the queue to buy the ticket which is 50₹ per head. There is also a 200₹ per head, special ticket but we didn't see anyone opting for it.  There's a nice waiting hall with…"
134,Zooming in Tamil Nadu,Located on an island in the sea with beautiful views of the 2 seas and Kanyakumari from a distance. A ferry takes you to the monument. Would recommend taking a VIP ticket to skip the long queue. Must go if in Kanyakumari.
135,Vacation ,Very nice picturesque destination and easy to reach as well.I reached here directly taking bus from Trivandrum which takes 2.5 hrs and bus drops you directly near the main spot.You can visit kanyakumari temple and famous  ferry ride to Vivekananda's memorial with a fee of 50 pp.You can drop your baggages in nearby cloth shops they charge 20 rs per bag and you can trust them as well. Definitely worth a place as large area which faces directly to 3 seas is mesmerising.
136,Mesmerising ,As suggested by our trip advisor community we took the first boat to the vivekananda memorial .. there waa a big line up but you can get special ticket for rs 200 each for the trip to the memorial . You have to lineup on the wayback. Good option if you have limited timeThe trip is so worth it . Peaceful and serene.. solid rocks standing tall on the indian occean where the waves are hitting it so hard . Even the five minute ride across is very bumpy due to the wavesPeace is thte keybword .. Meditation hall is amazingMust visit atteacrion while in town
137,A Memorial for Swami Vivakananda,"One of the best tourist place in Kanyakumari. Must visit place. Lots of knowledge on Swami Vivekananda available. We reached there via ferry. It's very crowded during morning hours, less crowd during afternoon hours. It covers thiruvalluvar statue on it's way back."
138,Must for all,"Short to no queue and a short boat trip to the Rock Memorial.  Shoes are not to be worn and given the heat, we were pleased to walk on the white painted ""lines"" - much cooler.  Both temples are beautifully crafted and built and a spell in the Meditation Room for complete silence and prayer very beneficial.  Highlight of my holiday tour of Kerala.  No gift shop but book shops available."
139,Nice arch,"This is the fourth time I have visited this place. By itself this is a place every Indian must visit. But a lot of improvements can be done. 1. Ferry ticket & the ticket to the  entry to the memorial can be issued together. As soon as you reach the memorial, there is a scramble to buy the ticket for visiting the memorial. Any one who goes to the rock will naturally wish to seethe memorial. 2. Upon the return, the ferry takes you to the Valluvar statue. There is again boarding at the memorial, deboarding at the valluvar statue, boarding at valluvar statue before deboarding at the mainland. The distance between the two is barely 50 meters. There is a rock outcrop between the two spots. I am sure that technology is available to build a safe foot bridge between the two spots. Then a lot of time can be saved by the crew & visitors. The sequence would be Pick up at the mainland, deboard at vivekanda memorial, walk to the valluvar statue & picked up at the valluvar statue & back to the mainland"
140,Beautiful structure in the middle of the sea!,"Great to see Nice architect, really well maintain one, kanyakumari is most popular tourist spot in tamilnadu"
141,Best place in kanyakumari,This is one of the main attraction in Kanyakumari. You can visit to this place through. There is small beautiful temple. View from this place is very beautiful
142,a must see if in the area,Nice place. Pls try to visit from OCT to JAN. Sunset and sunrise view are excellent. Tiruvalluvar status painting work in progress on Oct 2017.
143,Awesome,A must see place in india. You will be amazed  to see how the construction had been done . The Vivekananda statue stands very proud. Neat and clean . Rs 20 for boat trip to rock and Rs 20 for going to rock
144,Beautiful place with Great Views and peaceful environment.,"A must visit place in Kanyakumari is Vivekananda Rock Memorial and it’s a popular monument too. It was built in 1970 inside waters on an island in honour of Swami Vivekananda who is said to have attained enlightenment on the rock. Also according to local legends, it was on this rock that Goddess Kanya Kumari performed austerity. Memorial has a Devi Kanyakumari temple, Vivekananda statue erected in a raised hall, a Meditation Hall just below this construction, Bookstall plus other facilities for the convenience of visitors. One has to leave foot-ware after alighting from Ferry in a well organized counter which is a free service. Photography is not allowed inside the temple or other halls but can be taken outside and so you can take plenty of photographs of the monument and its surroundings. It’s a beautiful monument and has beautiful surroundings including a tall statue of Tamil Poet Thiruvalluvar on one side which looks elegant and enhances grandeur to the entire area. One has to avail facilities of Ferry service being maintained and operated by government through Poompuhar Shipping Corporation Ltd, to reach this place from the mainland. The Ferry charges are Rs 50 & 200 per person for a round trip in general queue and Special entry respectively. If too much long queues are there, it’s better to buy special entry tickets."
145,Average place with nice views,"from morning 8 am till around 3 pm or so continuous boat travel is available to and fro , the memorial  . in addition to the thrilling sea boat ride , the visit to the rock memorial is a wonderful experience . in addition to the vivekananda statue facing north-west , the meditation room below , the foot mark of devi kanyakumari , the book shop , the entire rock surface area is very well maintained , in spite of the heavy regular flow of tourists . one can closely see the very tall statue of Thiruvalluvar , the very famous poet of Tamil language . when we visited in november , the boat ride to the thiruvalluvar rock was withheld due to maintainance ."
146,Lovely Place!,"One of the best place of ocean , family visit lovely atmosphere, by boat we have to reach there and super historic place of Vivekananda , if someone in kanayakumari must visit ...."
147,Last point of India ,The family stayed at Kanyakumari in one of the sea side hotels. The aim was to see the sunrise and sunset at Kanyakumari. From there we made a trip to the Vivekananda Rock. For that you need to get a ferry. It's a big line to get a ticket for the ferry. So advisable to start early. Once you are at the rock you can return anytime. Rock offers  scenic beauty of the sea. Do visit and meditate at the meditation centre. Please carry adequate drinking water. Please ensure not to litter the place or throw litter into the Sea. Have a nice trip. Do visit once in lifetime .........
148,Beautiful place to see,"Very nice place.. middle of sea.. from where you can see water color changes, great place for meditation"
149,Peaceful place,"Firstly, one has to wait in a long queue for getting in boat approximately for more than one hour. But after getting in boat, everything seems nice. There is a book shop from where you can purchase books narrating sayings of Swami Vivekananda. There is one meditation center also."
150,Perfect,This is the best place to meditate. it was a little crowded outside. but inside the meditation area there is pin drop silence. Very peaceful place.
151,Impressive!,"It is the best attraction of Kanyakumari. The location, the history and the environment make this place famous. You will get great views of the sea from here."
152,Best place in Kanyakumari,"Here you can go only through ferry running by Govt of Tamil Nadu, fare per adult is Rs.50 for both up and down. You will have to wait in a long queue to visit the place because ferries are busy. Special passes are also available that can you make enter direct without any queue.…"
153,Simply WoW !,"This is a very special place of spirituality and reflection. One should make attempt to get that feeling.One needs to take a boat to the Rock memorial. The queues are long to get the tickets.There is another queue to visit the memorial.Positive point: a room for meditation in the spirit of Swami Vivekananda. Couple of book shops.The big statue in the ocean is of Thiruvalluvar, the great poet.There are no facilities for eating or drinking. On a warm day make sure that you carry  enough water or food for children."
154,Must visit,"Ferry ride and visiting Vivekanand Memorial is worth visiting. Adjacent to it if a huge Statue of Tamil poet n philosopher Guru Thirivaloor, it was under maintained at our time but one can go to platform level till feet. Site is good n worth visiting."
155,A tribute to the Monk,Very hot during summers. Boating ferry arrangements was poor especially queue management and ferry frequency.
156,Peaceful!,This is situated in a small rock off coast Cape Kanyakumari. Boat servicws are available at the cost of Rs.50/-. This is a historical place where Sami Vivekananda meditated before he left for Chicago summit. This place inspired him to go for the summit which resulted in famous Chicago address. Must see place. There is meditation hall also available beneath the hall where Vivekananda statue is placed.
157,It is one of the memorable and holy place for who are devotee of Sree Vivekanada Swami. Also a place where lovely time,Had been with family to this place a wonderful place and should not be missed at any cost when visiting Kanyakumari.Very well maintained
158,Must to visit in Kanyakumari,"The meditation hall is the one which caught me there . what a peaceful place.  The Om sound in the background and total silence.  It surprises me how 150 years ago Swami Vivekanand had gone there on the rock and meditated there in the middle of the sea which sometimes turns very turbulent without any fright,We Indians are really blessed to have had such people who still inspire us."
159,Very pleasant place to visit,Nice five minutes ferryLook at the foot print of the goddess Parvathi Be enchanted by the massive statue of Swami Vivekananda Must go to the dhyana mandapam which is the most serene place on the rock. Spend five minutes of nothingness thereRefreshed look at the views around and back in a ferryReally content
160,Vivekananda Memorial,"It was heavily crowded on the weekend, took more than an hour to reach the memorial. Just an imagination of swami Vivekananda who was enlightened here gives goosebumps. A wonderful place to visit"
161,Must Visit Place in Kanyakumari,It was an amazing experience to sit on the boat and reach the memorial. The light showers made it even better. The place is well kept and to view the end of India was a delight. Words cant express the feel visit to experience !
162,Nice Place,Vivekanand rock memorial is a must visit place in Kanyakumari. Travelling in a motor boat to Vivekanand rock memorial is a lifelong memory.
163,Awesome Experience in Kanyakumari ! Thorough Review of Vivekananda Memorial !!,"rock visit by fery service .(nominal charge to and fro- another ticket inside going 1has to purchase by standing in queue 2nd time .(1 for ferry and 2for entry ) .footwear deposit counter available,(very bad service-1has to lift footear by hand then search for water to wash hand.) poor tourist facilities . all around 1can see sea sea and sea and relax. photo not alowed inside statue hall, KANYAKUMARI FOOTRINT IS THE major attraction here..(must watch) the ferry takes to thiruvalluvar statue .and then return to boarding point.(broken concrete all over exit place.very poorly managed .tourists are nt cared for... ferry is overloaded with pasengers (wear life jacket). tamil nadu tourism ..not care for tourists..(very poor treatment towards us)  last boat at4pm only,, towars rock,(keep inmind)."
164,Beautiful monument,Had an amazing experience at Vivekananda Rock memorial in Kanyakumari. Ticket for ferry ride is 50 Rs per person and it gets open from 8.30 am till 4 Pm IST .   You get amazing feeling when you see India from Rock memorial it's nice feeling
165,Underwhelming,"there is very long queue for boat ticket counter, we have to wait 2 hours for 50 rupees ticket, special entry 200 rupees, that we can get with in minutes, no crowd for 200 rupees ticket."
166,The awesome spot of Kanyakumari,however cleanliness is good...rs 50 to and fro boat ride...then they ask for charity after they show 2 min documentry on vivekananda
167,The Spot in Kayanakumari,"A rock in the middle of the sea. Nice view around. Nothing much to see inside, but the view and the experience are awsome."
168,Awesome,Must visit place if you are in kanyakumari... Never felt so much better and relaxed... What a great feeling
169,Very nice place,I don't think you can say you've really visited Kanyakamuri unless you take the short boat ride across the water to this temple and statue celebrating Vivekananda's life and meditation upon the rock there... You have to queue in an area with cordons so that the queue is orderly…
170,Bit of a con but it's OK,It is one of main attractions of Kanyakumari....... arrangement for launch/Boat @50/- (up & down) per head ..... near sun rise point there is counter.... counter will be closed around 4pm... consecutive boat/launch for to and fro.... great view from Vivekananda Rock...... heavy…
171,A very nice place to visit and would recommend.,I heard about this place many a times and was very eager to visit this memorial but when I visited this place it was so impressive that I have no words to describe. It was shocking that how on earth Swami Vivekananda reached this place by swimming that wild sea. The memorial is a beautiful place with strong wind and the roar of ocean. This place is also wheel chair friendly to a certain extent. The security staffs are very helpful and strict to maintain the decorum of this great place. The meditation room is amazing and you will feel something special there in front of the statue of Swami JI. Also you can buy books from the souvenir shop which has got a very good collection of books on Swami Vivekananda in different languages. Overall an experience of lifetime to visit this place where you soul will get the peace in middle of a wild ocean.
172,Highlight of KANYAKUMARI,"The serene Rock 20 years back is becoming a commercial place, lacks proper maintainence, ,the ferry service ."
173,Fabulous temple,Clean and calm place. Spell bound experience viewing the sea side and inside the temple. It gives a spiritual feeling
174,"Visit to Swami Vivekananda Memorial Rock, Kanyakumari",Vivekanda Rock Memorial is one of Kanyakumari's must see places. You have to take a ferry from the beach to the small island where the memorial is located. There's quite a lot of people going to the rock and walking around the temple. It's nice.
175,A must visit,Must visit in Kanyakumari. Fabulous 360 degree view of sea. Maa Kanyakumari Footprint and Meditation Centre are divine. 
176,A must see place,One must visit during evening time to avoid scorching sun. And immediately you can have sunset just after returning from vivekanand rock. Please schedule your time after checking sunset time. Evening is more preferable.
177,Serenity meets divinity ,This place as it's name says is built in memory of Swami Vivekananda..to reach here take boat ride between 11 to 1 as it will be less crowded. Place where you can see three sea merge together and you can see three different color of water when they merge..it's a tourist attraction.
178,"A must see in Kanyakumari, but that's it","Must see place at kanyakumari Well maintained and kept cleanVivekananda Rock Memorial is a popular tourist monument in Vavathurai, Kanyakumari, India. It was built in 1970 in honour of Swami Vivekananda who is said to have attained enlightenment on the rock. According to local legends, it was on this rock that Goddess Kumari and vivekananda performed austerity.Their is s ferry provided by government at a very minimum fee to take you to the island and back from the island"
179,Vivekananda rock Memorial,Be very clear in mind. Kanyakumari is only about Godess's temple. You must go there with offering your prayer. Very holy place indeed. The two rocks on the sea next to Kanyakumari temple are new structures.  One that is call Vivekananda Rock is a tourist spot developed encasing the name of Swamy Vivekananda a nice statue inside having more prominence than Shri Ram Krishna and ShriMa. No puja artis are done. It is a propaganda joint of a socio political group who pushes people in to a room saying to help knowing Swamy Vivekananda but inside do just the opposite only talk about themselves and ask for charity. It's like given to write an essay on cow you go on writing all about the village where the cow also is found.Yes it is a nice place to enjoy the sea and take selfies. For me Swamyji is very different I cannot tolerate anyone undermines his stature for self propaganda. And no puja and arti for Sri Ramkrishna and ShriMa is a great insult to our belief. These are the people who are heartbroken for not been able to build Ram temple.My suggestion must visit but only for fun.
180,This is a must see.,"This is the place where Swami Vivekananda meditated for 2 day. This is a bit far from shore and one has to take ferry service in order to reach them.At this moment, this is not a very calm place due to crowd but still it is very scenic."
181,Endpoint India,"What a Place!Though you could hear Sea Waves Sound outside. I could hear my own heart beat inside, I fell in love with it.Must visit. 5/5"
182,It is Divine,"Be prepared to stand in a long queue under the hot sun to buy boat tickets, especially during holidays. The rock has the meditation point of Swami Vivekananda, meditation room, the southernmost point of the Indian peninsula, sunrise positions marked on a rock, etc. Worth a visit."
183,Vivekananda Rock Memorial,"This iconic new memorial serves as a focal point for the tip of India.  Pilgrims, tourist and merchants flock to this special area which memorializes Swami Vivekananda who helped bring Hinduism to the world."
184,vivekanand,This is the place where Vivekanadar meditated for 3 days before going to US.One needs to take the ferry operated by TN government to reach the spotlessly maintained memorial.There are two mantapams - one with V ivekandar statue. There is mediation hall. Also book and novelties stores.
185,"""Excellent""",My whole family trip concluded with visit to this place. My mother pointed out a very important thing to check the glow on the statue of Swami Vivekananda. Really awesome and inspiring place. Though at times the place is crowded with more than 1000 people it feels quite and peaceful.We just sat on stairs for more than an hour and it was relaxing experience there. Almost  all of us bought books and I bought inspiration thoughts by Swami. The best place to visit once.
186,Worth visiting,"Standing at the southern tip of India , when you look at this wonderful monument , you would realise that it’s totally worth the travel. Skipping to the tips I can offer : plan to reach by evening . Note that the last ticket is sold at 4 pm , but you can stay there until the last ferry . Evening are cooler and winds are strong . You would love it there . Sat and Sun reach around 3 as the queue can be longer . Once the sun provides you the golden light , it’s best to take your wide angle shots . I liked it more from the Thiruvalluvar statue , which provides a even wider view . The ferry route includes Vivekananda memorial as the first point and then proceeds to Thiruvalluvar statue and back to starting point. You have to take off shoes at both monuments . No photography is allowed inside the halls . You can photograph outside .Ferry charge per person : 50 Entry Ticket per person : 20 Toilets are available at both monuments .Food is not allowed .Birding : you might get some waders and terns around this place.Hope this helps ."
187,Amazing place,Vivekananda Rock is located near Kanyakumari on an island. One has to reach this island by a streamer.
188,Nostalgic place to visit,"This spot was so special. It's so beautiful on the island, but even more so, the temple is so powerful energetically.  Upstairs it's like standing in front of Vivekananda himself, but most of all, don't miss the meditation room downstairs. It reverberates to your soul and to the edge of existence. Make sure to allot some time to sit there quietly. Shambho"
189,Family get together,"Rock is sorounded by sea, u will love it. Cool breeze even during sunny day. Boat travel to rock is also a good experience"
190,Only visit if this place is of significance to you.,Vivekananda Rock Memorial is most popular tourist place in Kanyakumari. To reach this place you need to take ferry. Ferry normal charges is Rs.50/Per person. If you will go in after noon than you will get lesser queue. if you want to avoid the long queue than you can pay Rs.200 to get special entry. Ferry timing is from 9 AM to 5 PM..
191,An island of chaos,"The Rock where great Swami Vivekananda meditated for few days has many positive vibes . From here you can see the amalgamation of the Arabian Sea , Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean . It's breezy out here and we have to reach by a ferry . Meditation room is also there . Once…"
192,Nice place to visit,"Vivekananda memorial point is situated on a rock cliff which was about 300 mtr from the mainland Kanyakumari. The boat will take you there which cost Rs 50/- for both ways. It takes only 15 mins to reach there but it will take quite a long time to get into the boats. It is believed that the Swami Vivekananda meditated on this rock, where he sought enlightenment. Built in 1970 by the Ramkrishna Mission, it is committed to Swami Vivekananda. Very nice point to see the sangam of the trio i.e bay of Bengal, Indian ocean and Arabian Sea."
193,great place,"Located at the tip of the country, this is a fitting memorial to Swami Vivekanand, One has to take a ferry (Approx 7 mins) to reach the rock. The ferry services offer 2 types of tickets; 1) A regular ticket costs Rs 34 per person, 2) A special ticket costs Rs 169 per person,the queue for regular ticket is long and may take upto 2 hours waiting. It is advisable to buy a special ticket. Once you reach the rock, a ticket of Rs 20 is charged per person to enter the temple where the rock on which Swamiji meditated for 3 days before leaving for Chicago is housed. After exiting the temple one comes below to a meditation hall known as ""Dhyana Mandapam"" for visitors to meditate. There are book stalls containing various books of and on Swamiji. The view from the rock is amazing. one clearly see the Triveni (Confluence of the 2 seas and 1 ocean namely Arabian sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean.). That part of the sea is also known as Lacaddive Sea.At peak hours its extremely sunny and hot, be sure to carry a hat or an umbrella."
194,Very Nice Place to Visit,"Mind blowing ,mood changing atmosphere,it also remind about our culture ,you can see our Bharat ma there."
195,Good,"Frankly, unless you are Hindu, its not worth the hassles of line ups and dodgy ferry boats to reach this, well rock. Even if it is the southern tip of the subcontinent. It is, after all, primarily a Hindu Shrine."
196,Lack of Maintainenfe,Quite an amazing experience in being there at the Vivekananda memorial rock. It gives a feeling of Patriotism and pride. Don't forget to visit the meditation hall and the feet of Goddess. It is also a great place to take photographs covering see and the great moment around.
197,"Romantic experience in Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Kanyakumari",Definitely a tourist spot. It is not to be missed.The marvels of architecture from yester years leaves us amazed.
198,Must visit in Kanyakumari,"Guess April is not the time to visit tis attraction. It was extremely hot & island is treeless. Not forgetting the need to queue for the ferry & walk the length to & from the ferry to the attraction & back. The only cool place was within the memorial & its meditation hall. We wore socks bought hurriedly at the ferry Jetty & were advised to walk on the white areas as it was less hot! Be prepared to explore, otherwise it did not impress except for the beach & waters where the Indian continent ends & meets the 3 oceans, Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal & Arabian Sea! Waters were amazingly clear & beautiful."
199,An experience in itself,We visited kanyakumari for this place but due to harsh weather we could not reach there. We seen the Memorial from far but feeling very sad for not reaching there. Truly a must visit place and well maintained and managed tourist place.
200,Vivekananda rock,It is a beautiful rock memorial located where the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal merge with the great Indian Ocean. There is a huge statue of Swami Vivekananda and also a prayer room. Though it was hot and humid the breeze in the afternoon hours is a relief; the place is calm and…

202,"calm , peaceful place.","We had to go by boat to reach the Memorial. As the queues were long, we only arrived at the island in the late morning. The structures were quite new and impressive, though the grounds were not that vast and spreadout. We walked around the grounds, reading the description notes…"
203,Great place ,"Must visit. U will feel calm, cool and relaxed. The breeze there is so cool and soothing, u won't want to leave the place.Ferry rides are easily available at 34/- per head."
204,Sight seeing on 29 oct,"Feel proud when you stand at this southern point of india,Brilliant view, ambience, and memorial. To reach this point you need to buy a boat ticket of rs50 indian rupees ( both side ),Ticket counter opens at 8am and closes at 5pm. Each boat accommodates 150 people,A very must visit place."
205,Nice place to visit with family members & Children.,Vivekananda Rock Memorial is a monument built on a rock in the Indian ocean away from the Indian mail land. Beautiful monument indeed. But the boat service needs to be improved.
206,Very interesting place,"A place where you can rest your mind and soul... The point where great Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal meet with each other...and you can feel the vastness of the World"
207,Crowds but serene ,U can go by ferry from kanyakunari. 50 INR per head.if you would like 2 skip the queue it is 200 INR per head. The ferry is currently only going to vivrkwnanda rock. Would be good if it also goes to thiruvalla statue located nearby.vivekananda rock visit is neatly organized. You can capture a lot of pictures here and spend around 1 to 2 hours relaxing here. A must visit of u r in kanyakunari
208,Stunning view by the sea.,Kanyakumari is around 80kms from my hometown. Even though its near i had visted the place only few times. I went there and the view of the Vivekananda memorial from the boat club itself a treat to watch. The place was known for Vivekananda getting mukthi. As per the people there they say swami Vivekananda swim across to the rock since he had no money to pay for the fisherman. The place is nice and calm and place with sea breeze.
209,Great memorial,Great tribute to Swami Vivekanand in term's of great memorial. Connectivity by boat is well managed. All basic facilities available. It has meditation center. . Special lighting for few hours in Early morning and night. Overall well maintained
210,Best place of Kanyakumari,"Well maintained memorial, Fitting tribute to Swami Vivekanand.Small canteen selling mineral water and soft drinks will provide a soothing relief to parched throats.RegardsUdhbir Singh"
211,Elegant Monument for Swami Vivekananda,"Truly amazing place, fortunate enough to visit the place where Vivekanand ji came and did meditation.surounded by the sea the place is really amazing. Transported  by the ship which was such a beautiful journey although I was feeling a bit scared traveling in the ship. But loved visiting this historical place"
212,A spiritual place,"It was our dream come true by reaching this place on our bikes n bulls ..its very long que to stand in for ur turn if u wana special vip ticket then u have to spend some more money n u will reach n small ferry which will take u to the temple dirrectly with the life jackets mandatory...after doing darshan at vivekanand temple there is kanykunwari temple also which u can see the feet marks there ....its a must visit place in a life ,will try to go again before i am heading towards my retirement."
213,Must go...,"The place looks amazing depending on the weather and the time. More than beauty, what attracts me about this place is the fact that I am standing at the confluence of the two great seas that surround our country. That feeling is incredible!"
214,Boat trip is amazing,Not so peaceful and calm place.Nothing phenomenal about this place except the history associated with this place.
215,great architecture,"Vivekananda rock fort memorial is located in kanyakumari. There is frequent boat service to the rock fort. There is a meditation hall inside it and visitors can meditate there. Inside the meditation hall, the only sound is of OM.. and it's a good experience.   The boating in the sea is also very nice. But there is no online booking for the tickets and we should wait in the queue for hours or take a much expensive ticket to avoid the queue. Normal ticket costs 50/- while the other costs 200/-"
216,The Land of Speciality.....,The toilets must be cleaned every now and then. Really disgusting. The meditation room was superb and full of positive vibrations. The locals and Hindi and Telugu Speaking people must behave in public. They being very rude and self entitled every where which I don’t understand what’s the cause of the attitude.
217,Vivekananda Rock Memorial,"Go at about 2pm, the queue will be less. For other hours go for the Rs. 200 express pass. Will be worth."
218,Vivekananda rock,"This island is a monument to a Hindu monk who meditated and then attained enlightenment on this rock. Ironically, it has become an epitome of the chaos that I have come to associate with India.   I have never been a fan of touristy places so I seriously thought of giving this…"
219,Find God in solitude and attain peace,"Vivekananda rocks , best and number one tourist destination in Kanyakumari, morning 7 o'clock we are in que for tickets, and morning first trip go and enjoy few hours"
220,Good place ,nice memorial bulit by shree eknathji ranade nice maintained and a very nice view of the triveni sangam  must visit for once in a life time to see the end of main land india amazing structure but  u nedd to have patience to wait in the long que for the boat at the jetty
221,Nice Place and well maintained,"Vivekananda rock memorial is always been on top of my list of visiting places in kanyakumari, i enjoyed visiting this place the boat ride and The mediation hall was very pleasant place."
222,Visit to Kanyakumari,Must visit if you are in kanyakumari... Do meditate for couple of minutes.. This place was very energetic with lots of positive vibes.. Also visit the book shop and explore the vast literature relatwd to swami Vivekananda ji and his teachings. This was my second visit
223,Nice place rocking place for photography ,"It is the places of attraction in Tamilnadu, here 3 oceans were meeting at one place and sun rising is the important thing to see here."
224,Very well maintained ,"It gets too hot during summers and as you have to take off your shoes, your feet burn. Overall a must visit place as it is the southern most tip of India. "
225,Vivekananda Rock Memorial,If I knew then what I know now I would have given this attraction a miss. You visit the memorial by ferry. One can purchase a regular ferry ticket for Rs.50 or a VIP ticket for Rs.200. As there were very few people in line the staff at the ticket booth suggested we buy the…
226,soothing place...,"We travelled by launch from the shores of Kanyakumari to Swami Vivekananda Rock Memorial. From there the 3 water bodies Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean was visible. The sea breeze just blew us away. There was brilliant meditation hall of Swamiji. Vivekananda's relics are kept inside. The place is awesome. It is great for photography also."
227,Beautiful Views,"Spend atleast 2-3 hours, sit in the open and enjoy the breeze...total mind relaxation...you at pece with yourself and the world....you don't feel like moving back"
228,Good for a one time visit,The place has been maintained well and kept clean. But the life jackets need some sprucing up to be done as they smell a lot.The boat ride costs rs 50 per person and then to enter the premises on the island one has to pay rs 80 per person.Over all a good place.
229,Holy palace,"Very well maintained. The meditation room though you are asked to maintain silence, people tend to talk. You get the glimpse of the history of Swami Vivekananda and his journey to Chicago,USA"
230,A must visit place,"Dedicated to one of the strongest spiritual gurus of India, one gets to experience peace surrounded by majestic views of ocean on all sides.....experience worth taking at least once in life....."
231,Excellent place for family visit ,We went during the non-peak season - March. It was hot but not crowded. The queues were not long. But could not visit the Thiruvalluvar statue as the boat ride to it is only after 2 p.m.
232,Must Visit in Kanyakumari,"We whole family enjoyed the scenery and appreciate this place,peace of mind and enjoy the heavenly winds blowing."
233,car trip from bangalore to kanyakumari to rameshwaram and back,"A great place to pay tribute to swamiji and his greatness, to feel what he felt when he visited here and meditated on the rocks. Sadly some of the people who are visiting here donot seem to understand the very essence of this place and resent to break the line, shouting and what not and has become more of a tourist spot."
234,Amazing place to visit,"Great place with highly significance in Indian history, great experience in meditation room at smarak, you can see the souther tip of India with Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal & Indian Ocean coming together at Sangam. Rock is magnificent & with Parvati mandir. Normally during weekends there is huge rush & waiting time for boat will be between 1-2 hrs, there is special entry also available at Rs 200/- per head. It takes around 2 hrs to complete this trip."
235,Over hyped,Nice place to visit in kanyakumari. Instead of traditianal importance treat VMR as a point of national heritage. You need to take a ferry (Rs. 50 per person for to and fro). @VRM you need to pay Rs. 20 per person as entry ticket. The memorial is beautiful with a very nive view of sea and waves splashing all around. Ferry will take you to thruvalluar statue then back to boarding point. From there bhagwati temple is almost 200 mtr. Warning: Male need to go in the temple bare chested and thr is an entry fee for each person of Rs. 20. A must visit temple as it is one of the Shaktipeeth of Goddess Durga
236,Great visit ,"Really Kanyakumari is must visit if u r planning Kerala your no matter traveling distance ,no excuse Our tour was hectic as w travel from tekkady to kanyakumari by 4 to 5 hours journey but it’s worth This memorial will refresh you and ur kids will love the sea n boat ride to see trivani sangam and swami Vivekananda Rock Memorial View from this memorial is fantastic Try to go early in the morning"
237,Better then expect ,"In today's stressful life, to get mental peace,seating in the meditation center is must, surrounding is beautiful, minimum 1.5hrs needed to cover, to reach there Rs 50/-per head return ferry tkts to be taken, not to forget buying souvenirs from the shops managed by trustee in…"
238,Keep your eyes closed and experience the silence,"This ought to be a place for reflection and solitude. A place to meditate amidst the songs of the sea and ocean.In reality this is an overrated, overcrowded tourist stop. From the mainland the sight of the rock and its small temple is almost obliterated by a mammoth statue of the great Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar, which totally lacks any artistic finesse. Then you get the 'refugee experience' the moment you step into the ferry - rows of benches where people are squeezed into close proximity, wearing dirty, bulky life vests.Then you reach the rock and try to salvage the remains of your day - a few photographs here and there, a futile attempt to feel an 'atmosphere', a few moments looking out towards the horizon and in convincing yourself that you can see the exact line where the seas meet the ocean."
239,Kanyakumari Road Trip,Swamy Vivekanand selected this place out of many places in India which he found to have ultimate positive energy and got enlightenment at this place. It’s a must visit place in South India.
240,Tourist Spot,Nice place.. Breeze soothen our mind and body. Nice view from here. Sit on meditation hall keeps our mind calm. It keep very clean and neat
241,Magnificent statue of Thiruvallur,"Important Aspects:1) Issue of tickets will close by 3:30PM approx. So plan early2) You will reach the Memorial via Ferry - Amazing view point, photographers this is time to be ready!!3) Restrooms are available here4) Meditation room is available5) Heavy winds around"
242,Amazing view,This place can be reached in a short time from Thiruvananthapuram also. The monument is worth visiting and on a sunny day can offer you some stunning views particularly in evening. Watch three different coloured water meet at this tip. Spend some time in memorialOverall a worth visiting place.
243,Amazing Place,"Even with the high crowd, you will feel rejuvenated. The place where the great monk meditated is definitely a must see place."
244,A place not to be missed at any cost.,"I had gone to Kaniyakumari about 30 years ago. But it was late evening by the time we reached the place and the ferry service  was not available. I Ialways thought this rock to be a tiny thing which could accommodate about 10-15 people.Another attraction was the LEGEND OF how Swami Vivekanand reached this place. It is sajd that he walked on water to reach this rock and this is where he got his enlightenment before he left for Chicago to participate in the WORLD CONGRESS OF RELIGIONS.Another unknown fact about this rock is that I has a small temple around a ROCK which has A NATURAL inscription of a FOOT. This is believed to be that of GODDESS PARVATHI when she did penance to Lord Shiva to get married to him.My dream finally came true.FERY SERVICE1 Two kinds of tickets are available Rs 50 (general ticket and a lot of crowd)  and the Rs 200 (opens only when the croqd in the Rs 50 queue is brimming like crazy). The ride is jat 15-20 mins.2 Once I reached the rock, I realized how enourmoualy BIG it was than I imagined. I felt it was much bigger than the ""SO CALLED STATUE OF LIBERTY"" IN LIBERTY ISLAND  NEW YORK.3 You need to take of your slippers and place it in the FREE counter. (Which I think is pretty appropriate given the significance and stature of this monument) But don't work even in scorching heat you can walk around the monument on the designated path ainted in white heat reflecting paint. The monument has stalls from where you can buy Calendars, souvenirs and books relate to Vivekananda.Great place to go. Don't miss if you are going anywhere near Kaniyakumari."
245,Different experience once in a life time,"Swami Vivekananda Rock Memorial is located on a small island in sea of Kanyakumari, a must visit. The island is accessible through ferry rides, a thrilling journey for nature lovers and adventure seekers.The island have a historical tales and legend beliefs. As per legends Goddess Kumari performed austerity on this rock. There is a 'Dhyana Mandapam' located beside to memorial which serves as the meditation hall for the visitors to meditate. Further as per history Swami Vivekananda visited Kanyakumari in 1892 and it is to said that he meditated on the rock for two days and attained enlightenment."
246,Purity of mind and soul at Vivekananda Rock,"The sight from the top of the rock into the horizon is beautiful. Swami Vivekananda found peace on this rock as he meditated there and I too sensed a feeling of inner peace when I was there. Ferry runs from 8 AM in the morning till 4PM to the rock, but best time to visit is…"
247,Silence ,It one one memorable thing in the life visiting the the place at the the sea wvisited spot by ferry which charges RS 50 for to and fro .is is very enjoyable spot . especially for youngy person and kids
248,Excellent pristine place with cool sea breeze.,the waves crashing on the rocks below...go visit it on a cloudy day....u will realise why its a perfect pace for meditation...very soothing place....no tries of extracting money from tourists....informative definitely a place not to miss.....also the boat journey is fun for kids....
249,Memorial is good to watch,"Peace and meditation midst of 3 seas (Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal). Meditation Hall is excellent. Real tribute to Swami Vivekananda. 3 different seas are visible during bright day light. A short video film is shown at the beginning. Excellent place and…"
250,Just Wow!,"We left our hotel at 10 am and were done by 3 pm, so this was a 5-hour adventure.Outside there are two queues along the front of roadside shops. One is the normal Rs 50 queue and the other is the Rs 200 Special Entry queue. It is not clear which is which. We did not know that we were in the Rs 200 queue. The queues are long, I will add pictures later. Take enough water!There is a scramble for life jackets before getting on the rickety outsourced Government ferryboat.  Note that this is the only transport to the Island - the many colourful fishing boats don't go so I presume it's a monopoly.There's not much to see at the landing area on the Island.  To go up, you unfortunately have to pay another Rs 20 Dharsan. We weren't interested in going inside temples and tried to argue this unsuccessfully. We paid another Rs 20 each to go to the upper level. I don't know why they don't just make the ticket costs Rs 70 and Rs 220 on the mainland for transparency and simplicity.We took some good pictures at the top. We were satisfied at having been to the most Southern point of India and visited the must-see attraction in Kanyakumari.The ferry did not go to Thiruvalluvar Statue and we saw no people there.Overall it's a marginally worthwhile endeavour. You are tied in to whichever queue you join, a single ferry operator, an extra Rs 20 fee on the Island and the possibility of not being able to go to Thiruvalluvar Statue. Long queues make this unsuitable for children."
251,Serene and calm,Boating to Vivekananda Rock Memorial made ambitious feel to reach the rock in Indian Ocean. Traditional stone made temple complex create spiritual feel. Crowd people really enjoy it.
252,Worth visit this memorial and safety on the ferry travel to be improved,"The place has many significance. The best part about the place is that it is the southern most tip of our country and all u see from the place is the confluence of 2 Seas and 1 ocean. If you go behind the main building and stand with your back towards it, you will be facing the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal at your Left and Arabian Sea at your right. All you see from here is clear blue water of the Ocean. Just opposite to the memorial is the rock which has a foot mark on it and is said that Devi parvati did tapasya by standing on one leg order to impress Lord Shiva and Marry him. To reach the Island you need to take a boat ride which costs Rs 50 Per Person for a two way ride."
253,Good to visit place,Kanyakumari#Vivekananda Rock Memorial#must visit place once in kanyakumari#surrounded by a breathtaking view of  three oceans.Sea view from the memorial is mesmerizing.
254,Just a tourist spot FULL STOP. ,Beautiful architect with spiritual divine place 1. Ferry charge is 50 rupees 2. They give life jacket 3. First passengers are taken to vivekanada rock fort there we need to take entry ticket 4. After which we are taken to tiruvalluvar fort through ferry which is located next to…
255,Great place at the Ocean.,"The Rock memorial is a place of huge cultural importance, but the memorial in itself is nothing special.There is a ferry ride to reach here, and unless you start early in the day, there would be long queues for it.The ride and views from the rock are good, apart from that nothing much to see here.There is a meditation hall, but everybody keeps talking there."
256,Peace and Meditation midst three seas!,It was enjoying even if it was at rush hour.It was my first time to be there while I was in India.I hope I will come back with a lots of time and good camera.
257,Awesome ,You have to go and experience it. When you stand and thinking this is end of India..and only water nothing u can see.. go and feel it. Cheers !!!
258,Great place ,Government Ferry service is only available to go to Vivekananda Memorial Rock and Thiruvalluvar statue - placed on two adjascent rocks. You can spend about 3 hrs here. Need Ticket for medication  hall.Book stall available for Vivekananda related books. Clean toilet and drinking water are available.  Ferry takes you to adjascent Tiruvalluvar statue rock from where you can return to Kanyakumari main land. You can claim up to the pedestal of Tiruvalluvar statue.There is a photo taking point at the Ferry landing place on return.
259,Beautiful architecture built in mid of sea,Vivekananda Rock Memorial is one of the most visited tourist spot in Kanyakumari. This memorial was built in the year 1970 in an honor of Swami Vivekananda. There is a mandabam for the visitors to meditate. One should visit this place to know more about the place and to have a good sight of the the nature.
260,A calm place,I went to Vivekananda Rock Memorial. The magnificent Vivekananda Rock Memorial is located on a small island off Kanyakumari. It has the picturesque Indian Ocean in its backdrop and hence serves as a peaceful and serene destination for visitors from all across the globe. It is great place to go.
261,Vivekananda Rock,Out of the world !!! wonders of nature could be seen. Meditation room is awesome. Colours of three waters could be seen from this point.
262,AMAZING PLACE  MUST SEE,"Kanyakumari is synonymous with Vivekananda memorial on a huge rock.  This is a famous architecture masterpiece and a tourist attraction for spiritual values.  Swami Vivekananda was said to have mediated on the rock; It is difficult to imagine the size of the huge rock on which the memorial stands; also it is difficult to imagine the amount of labour and the difficulty people would have faced to construct this great monument; simply great;  the place is very windy; therefore wear suitable clothes; very sunny on the rock; wear sun glass; wear a tight big hat; sun creams would be handy too if one is sensitive to sun; at certain places the floor is very hot, so watch out; be extremely careful with children for reasons like crowd, wind, sea etc.  Also it is difficult to trace people for the complex and massive nature of the structure.; meditation room is available; book stall; a cloakroom is there; entry fee is reasonable; One can reach this place only by boat operated by Tamil  Nadu Government for a fee; the boat ride is somewhat rocking, so take care."
263,"Ok place, nothing great","On Monday 30 Jul 2018, me and my wife visited this place. Fee Rs.50 and to wait for more than 30 min to get into the ferry; but pay rs.200 to quick entry into boat. No one explained how to wear lifejacket; most of them just wear it or hold it on hand. Unless properly the visitors were informed about lifejacket and in case of accident (God forbids) there would be many fatalities for which the concerned department is fully responsible.

270,most sought after destination in kanyakumari,"I am always a great admire of Swami Vivekananada.The belief is,he went into meditation on this rock for 2 days,swiming the crocodile filled sea before he left for Chicago and delivered his phenomenal lecture.Local people think this rock is blessed by Goddess Kumari.This rock can be reached by Govt run ferries,takes about 10 mins from shore.Ferry charges are 50Rs per head and entry fees is 20Rs per head.Shoes are not allowed."
271,Must place in Kanyakumari,"Very nice monument to Swamy Vivekananda. Plan your visit either early in the morning or late afternoon else it might get too hot.The ferry service gets crowded and is mismanaged.Queue will be too long with waiting time of more than 2 hours during peak season.Only 3 ferries in operation. This can be increased to manage the crowd, but alas who cares about the common man.Ferry ride starts at 7:45, but normal queue (Rs.50/person) might already be quite long. Try the special entry queue of Rs.200, it will be free especially early in the morning."
272,Hot During Summers,"I think I should thank weather god since I have heard that how hot it becomes during a common sunny day. I took a ferry from Boating point that took 10 minutes to reach at Vivekanand Rock Memorial - it was slightly drizzling , that had doubled the enjoyment. From there, we took another ferry (ticket all included) to reach Thiruvellarai Statue from where you can have 360 view.. One of the experience that no one should miss in case they are in Kanyakumari Kumari. Overall, I found this place very nice and enjoyable with family , just because of its sheer location and close to nature."
273,Good place,"Vivekananda rock is the chief attraction while visiting the southern-most tip of Indian peninsula Kanya Kumari. In December 1892, Swami Vivekananda meditated on the rock foe three days, before he started his world wide travels to spread the message of Hinduism. One can take a ferry to the rock that is about 200 meters from the main-land. Ferry charge is Rs 50 for round-trip. A boat leaves every about 20 minutes and can carry up to 200 visitors.  The rock itself has a temple of Vivekananda and book stalls that sell his books and statues. There is also a meditation hall. View of the sea is remarkable as one can see the meeting point of the Bay of Bengal on the left and the Arabian Sea on right. There are no restaurants or the rock and even cold-drinks are not available. Entry fee to the rock memorial os Rs. 20.  The ferry also takes visitors to another rock memorial of the famous South Indian poet saint Thiruvalluvar. That memorial has a 130 feet tall  stone statue of Thiruvalluvar. That memorial is the second stop and I saw that not many  visitors  go there after visiting the Vivekananda memorial."
274,Good place to visit,The Vivekananda Rock memorial located on the Vivekananda Rock is the most famous landmark of Kanyakumari. There are regular ferry services to the memorial. The memorial is beautifully constructed. It has a meditation hall in which people can meditate. One can also buys books and publications regarding life and times of Swami Vivekananda here.
275,The amazing rock,"Vivekananda Rock Memorial built in memory of Swami Vivekananda is most visited destination in Kanyakumari; the memorial is built on a rock which is located off-the main land. It is said, on reaching Kanyakumari, Swami Vivekananda who wanted to meditate on the rock not having enough money to offer boat/ferry, swam across the sea to reach the rock. Ferry services, run by Govt. connect the mainland and the rock memorial operating from 8 AM to 4 PM IST. The other important mandapa in the rock memorial is Shripada memorial. Legend says Bhagavathy Amman did penance with one leg on this rock wanting to marry Lord Shiva. The human leg-like form is believed to be of the Goddess Amman. Located nearby is 133 feet tall Thiruvalluvar Statue (renowned Tamil poet) built by the Govt of Tamil Nadu in 2000 in the honour & memory of the Great poet. Combined structure offers a beautiful Sun rise view early morning between 6-6.30 AM."
276,Excellent place,This is shall be visited place of Kanyakumari in India as it is last milestone of India and also inside the three Seas
277,Good place to visit,This memorial is located in the middle of the confluence of the three seas. It is believed that Swami Vivekananda attained enlightenment on this rock so in 1970 this memorial was built here in his honour.     Near the Tribeni Sangam of Kanyakumari there is the boat jetty from…
278,Great place,"We have visited Vivekanannda Rock Memorial and Vivekananda Kendra on February 07' 2019, it was great experience. Vivekananda Rock memorial and Vivekananda Kendra Kanyakumari is a must visit place, well maintained and provided with all amenities for visitors. Both are of historical importance for us. Vivekanada Kendra have a permanent exhibition for Ramayan its of great experience for new visitors. We enjoyed this visit and want to visit again to spend more time."
279,Beautiful,"kanyakumai's main attraction is definately Vivekanad Memorial Rock. it is built on a huge rock where it is believed that  vivekanand ji got salvation, knowledge by sitting on this rock for 3 days continous. One goes there by ferry which is easily available after every half an hour but there is a line for that. For each adult ferry cost 50rs. however if you want to skip the huge queue you can take special entry ticket which will cost you 200rs. per person. Eatables aren't allowed inside. Water is, and it is highly advisable to carry your water bottles because its going to be very hot there. entry ticket for the memorial is 20rs. per person. there is a temple too in the memorial premise. you can visit that too. Inside the memorial  its so quite, one can sit there and feel the peaceful environment of the place. One can see the 3 oceans from the top. its a beautiful place to see all surrounded by ocean."
280,Very beautiful.,Went to Vivekananda Memorial in the evening 4pm got the special tickets (about Rs. 150)- no queue to enter the ferry in the main land but for return trip took almost 45 minutes wait time. Think the morning trip like 9am to the Memorial will take lesser time since the return trip is not v.crowded by then.Special ticket is not required for kids below 10 years of age.Toilets were smelly and the line to the ferry is just behind the toilet - management needs to do something about it.The ticket counter is supposed to close at 5pm but ppl were allowed to come till 5:45pm - so can take the last couple of rides to the memorial and wait till late night for lesser crowd during the return.
281,In search of peace & divinity,"When I first got to Kanyakumari I did not think I would go and see Vivekananda Rock memorial, I thought it would cost too much. After going to the ferry and checking the prices I realized it was really well priced. The memorial is beautiful and you get an amazing view of the ocean and city."
282,Peaceful Place,The place is good for the people who have deep faith in the philosophy and teachings of Swami Vivekananda. It is situated on a rock in the sea. There is room for meditation also for the people who wish to do meditation in the oceanic atmosphere. Swamiji too came here to…
283,Serenity destroyed,Very good LANDMARK in middle of SEA really it gives u something extra ordinary feelings but boat which u take u there is very dirty and crew is totally nonsense But it's just 10 minutes journey so we can take it
284,nice memorial w,"I remember contributing Re 1/- while at School in 62 or 63, towards this Memorial and had been wanting to visit ever since. The major attraction in Kanyakumari undoubtedly is this. A boat ride, which can be quite a ride, take you to the Memorial. Apart from a Statue and books, there isn't really much on offer. Yet one felt fulfilled"
285,Memorable Trip,"Being situated at the Southernmost tip of Mainland India & being at the confluence of three seas, Kanyakumari is the natural attraction to all the Indian. Beside the famous temple of Kumari Amman situated right in front of the confluence, the Vivekananda Rock, being raised from the sea, is the prime attraction to all the visitors.The famous rock is situated in the sea just few hundred meters from the shore. Swami Vivekananda, during his 'Bharat Darshan' came at Kanyakumari in December, 1892 and meditated on this rock before devoting himself to the service of mankind.The present memorial temple built on this rock just 50 years back & dedicated to the memory of Swamiji & his idea of spirituality. The memorial temple is spread over the entire rock & only be accessed by a short ferry service from the adjacent shore throughout the day. The normal to & fro boat fare is Rs. 34.00, where one may have to stand in a long queue for onward journey, depending upon the tourist rush. We had to wait for about 2 hrs during last week of December. One may opt for special service @ Rs 169.00 to minimise the waiting time. The return ferry is easy to avail as the crowd furcated. Beside this, there is another Rs. 10.00 entry fee to the memorial.The memorial temple is built with typical shrine structure spread in layers, composed & surrounded by sea. There is a meditation room for the interested people. The clean, calm & holy ambience of the memorial temple grossly affected due to heavy turn out of the casual visitors. However, one can make ownself isolate and feel the purity & divinity within the vastness of surroundings. For nature lover/ shutterbugs, the place provides excellent view of main land with colorful sea on a bright day.A sky-touching statue of Saint Thiruvallur, an eminent Tamil poet & philosopher, situated right beside the rock, which very prominently seen from the shore, though during our previous visit some years back, we had opportunity to visit the spot via return ferry.A tour to South India is incomplete without this place."
286,Splendid Location,This is the place where Swami Vivekananda is believed to have attained enlightenment.He meditated on the rock in whose memory the memorial was constructed in 1970.There is also a meditation room.
287,Rameshwaram kanyakumari Trip,Engineering marvel and tribute to the wandering monk.  Vivekananda did meditation here in IV week of December before departing to Chicago for world congress on religions.
288,Good location but very little to explore,"An historic/geographic/national landmark - made possible by the efforts of one determined man - Eknath Ranade. Swami Vivekanand - the most dynamic of the modern saints of India - prayed here for 3 days and nights and had a vision of the future of India. More importantly, the rock preserves the lone footprint of the goddess Devi Kanyakumari who did penance here. A remarkable place, a must visit."
289,Tourist attraction and must see,"The Vivekananda Rock Memorial is a fitting tribute to the Swamiji who awakened the soul of India. The ferry ride to the memorial was a bit rough, but worth it. The calmness one fells once inside the hall needs to be experienced first hand. Goddess Parvati’s footprint is another…"

This place, though in the midst of the sea waves, has a special silence and you could hear the voice of your innerself.. The Vivekananda Mandapam and the Shripada Mandapam are the two main complexes of the memorial ...Don't miss this place.."
292,Inspiring memorial,"I had been to Kanyakumari during my visit to Thiruvananthapuram with my family. It took us about 3 hours to reach but the trip was awesome.Vivekananda Rock Memorial is must visit place if you are traveling down to South India.

294,Sea Rock Memorial,As usual visited this place four times I  the last ten years and its amazing. With visit again and again
295,Very nicely made,"Swami Vivekananda is one of India's great religious philosophers, and this commemorates the location where he meditated before his famous Chicago trip.  Definitely worth visiting.  The ferry tends to be very busy with long queues, but you can bypass the queue by buying a Rs 200…"
296,Memorable visit to Vivekanand rock,"At the south most tip of the mainland India, on the tri-junction of  the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. A very tranquil and peaceful place. Kanyakumari is well connected by all means of transportation and the last leg is by the Govt managed ferry. During the peak season or rush period, you can jump the queue by paying a special fees of Rs 200 as against the normal charge of Rs 50. However, no priority will be given on the return journey. Please do carry water and eatables if you cannot survive for a few hours without food and water (there is nothing available on the micro island/rock). Though the circuit is so designed that you do not miss any attraction, but do remember to sit for a while in the Meditation Hall. It is divine.."
297,Avoid on tourist months and weekends,It is in memory of the Great Vivekanand. Swami Vivekananda needs no introduction. This is the place where he used to do meditation.
298,Can visit once,Didn't find that attractive .. people will push u like crazy ... Don't plan to visit in the afternoon.. rest it is surrounded by sea ..so overall ok
