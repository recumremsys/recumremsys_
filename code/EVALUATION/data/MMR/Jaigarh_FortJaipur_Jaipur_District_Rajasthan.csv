47,Sabse Badi Top at Jaigargh fort,Among the Forts of importance in Jaipur is the Jaigarh Fort. It is well connected with taxis and should not be a problem to come here. For people who want to visit all the forts and places fast it's always better to take planned tours or hire a Full Day Taxi as getting New cabs from forts can be a problem. Jaigarh Fort does have a restaurant and places to eat nearby but having a full meal in open heat is not something I prefer. Overall it was an excellent trip.
48,Interesting Fort,Jaigarh Fort of Jaipur situated along the Aravali Ranges close to the Amer Fort and Lake was built by King Jai Singh II to protect the Amer Fort and its palace complex. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that an artillery Cannon called 'Jaivana'; which was manufactured in the fort precincts and is the world's largest wheeled cannon is located there.

98,Not worth the admission fee,"Jaigarh Fort on the Aravalli Hills overlooking Jaipur was built by the royals. Besides its strategic importance and picturesque setting there are three major things that one needs to see and enjoy.(1) The water harvesting system built by the royals hundreds of years before stands to this day. The 3 reservoirs and canal system, its water purification technique, coolness of drinking water and the slope made for the water to flow is remarkable even to the standards of our modern times. The storage capacity of 2.3 crore litre of water could provide clean and good drinking water to a population of 10,000 for a complete 365 days. Just remarkable.(2) The fort houses the 'World's Biggest Cannon' weighing 250 tonnes and one required 4 elephants to turn it. Surviving hundreds of years, there is no corrosion. And the scientific technique of the pond at its back so that incase the cannon ball back fired, it would fall in the pond of water and the people igniting the rope laced with gunpowder could jump in the pond to save their eardrums bursting from the cannon fire sound.(3) The 'Multani Mitti' thin sarees available in the shop selling artifacts and leather items, clothes, souvenirs, footwear is a must to visit and purchase some Jaipur memories souvenir.Advisable : Hire a government approved guide and definitely carry a camera to capture the moments which you will relish. A Rs.70 ticket entitles you the entry."

Jaigarh Fort looks more aged due to average maintenance as compare to Amber Fort. There is Old Cannon Factory inside the fort…
114,Good view,This place probably has the best views in all of jaipur. Worlds largest cannon is an added attractionWould recommend driving up till the top especially with kids and elders
115,Beautiful view. Must See!,If you are at the Amber fort also go to Jaigarh fort it has the most beautiful views you can see very far!!!!
116,Military Fort with nice view over the moutain,"People go for jaiban, biggest canon which is just majestic. But there is more, after the war museum, go straight to  narrow dark corridor (avoid the guides, there is NO bhool bhulaiya). Just after the corridor there is open complex, takes you to the outer wall, and the view of Amer fort from there is beautiful ."
117,"Very nice visit, do not miss if after Amber Fort, a famous neiglbour!","Worth the money to go in just to see the view of amber fort from jaigarh Fort.Other than that, it is pretty standard Fort. Nothing much to offer"
118,nice view ,"This fort is beautiful, especially the tunnel made into the fort. Even in summer, the tunnel remains cool due to especially designed ventilation system. Here one can have a look at the weapons used by Maharaja Man Singh. I am just mentioning one such thing, the armor (used to wear under dress during war) of Maharaja Man Singh was of weight 50 kg which one can see there. Various other interesting weapons are there.The ticket cost per person is INR 50 for Indian tourist. One thing to note that you need to take ticket for vehicle also if you want to take the vehicle inside the fort. This will cost you INR 100 (No need to take ticket for driver if you take ticket for vehicle). But you can also park outside. If you park outside you hardly need to walk around 100 meters to get inside the fort.One can enjoy Camel Riding there and take shoot photos in traditional Rajsthani Dress. I will suggest to take Camel Riding at Jaigarh Fort as it is cheaper as compared to other places but don't take photos in Rajsthani Dress there as it is costlier than other places.Overall it was good experience to visit there."
119,Can have Best view of city from fort..,The fort is better maintained than others. Most of the sections are replicas. Can realise the scientific thoughts even in those days. Sheesh Mahal there is just a eye wash. Too over priced for a glass maze. Nice drive up to the fort.
120,"At the end of a winding road, too narrow for tour busses","Climb up the fort to enjoy beautiful scenery, also stopby to see the big iconic cannon. They have tunnel connecting to Amer fort, do check if you have time. Trip was part of composite ticket we bought in City Palace."
121,Beautiful ,"This fort is near Amer Fort, but the access route is different. This is on a different hill top but can be easily seen from Amer fort. As told by my guide that amer fort and Jaigarh fort are connected to each other by an underground tunnel. There is an armoury inside this fort. Also you can find a huge cannon kept at one corner of fort. You can have a beautiful view of Amer fort from one end of this fort. This fort is on a higher hill than that of Amer fort. You can plan Jaigarh fort and Nahargarh Fort together as they are easily accessible and closer as compared to that with Amer fort. You must include this Fort in your itinerary. You can also take your car inside the fort by paying an extra 100 INR, but this will not be of much help as you wont be able to enjoy the fort to the fullest. Eldery people can opt for this facility."
122,Jaigarh Fort,The best way to reach to Jaigarh fort is to go through tunnel from Amber Fort. There is around 2 or 3 kms tunnel from Amber fort and it brings you to the Jaigarh fort. (I suggest this way only for healthy people). Also Jaigarh fort is big so there is so much to walk to understand different places and there you can find so many ancient weapons. From top of Jaigarh fort you can get beautiful ariel view of Amber Fort.
123,Interesting place to spend an hour or two,"Among many Forts, Jaigarh Fort just adds to the beauty of Jaipur. Located at the top, one can have an amazing view."
124,Must visit when in Jaipur ,"This huge mountain fort, sit atop the more refined Amber fort and this fort is rougher, bigger and to a large degree more impressive. Need to access it through a winding path, and be ready to walk "
125,"huge, good view of amer fort","It’s just on the way to Nahargarh fort. Amer fort can be seen from here. Nothing special about this fort, just visit if you have time."
126,Victory Fort,We found out surprisingly that there is a tunnel connecting amer palace to jaigrah fort. It’s a 30 minutes walk which is worth the climb (when it’s not too hot). Amazing views!!!
127,Excellent ,in Jaipur. amazing location and great view on the top of the hill. Enjoyed also the fine architecture of this fine fort.
128,"Much  Hyped,  but has scope for improvement","Situated on the promontory called Cheel ka Teela, Jaigarh Fort is quite rugged. From here you can see Amer Fort too. There is a watch tower from where you can get spectacular views. A famous cannon called JAYVANA is an interesting exhibit here. Chaarbag Garden is beautiful, not…"
129,Excellent,This place preserves one of the strongest weapons of the World in ancient times. The place provides a great view of the surroundings.
130,top of class,"We visited this place with mindset that its just another historical place of jaipur. But we were wrong, in each section of this fort you will find some thing really amazing and interesting. Main attraction of this fort is, world's largest canon on wheel and till today impossible…"
131,Massive Fort,"All forts in Rajasthan are lovely and I just love to see Royal places, we all friends enjoyed a lot and lot, go for it."
132,1/2 day trip,It was an historic visit to this fort for us as everything is nicely preserved in the fort. The garden is luch green and the atmosphere is calm.I spent almost 2 hours here and it was really a memorable visit.
133,Nice view ,"The fort is at the top of the mountain and accessible also from Amer fort. Provide a whole day to visit Jaigarh and Amer Forts. It is a wonderful place and ‘ankh bhar ke dekh lo’.  The guides do injustice to these places, as they have to maximise the number of customers, so they…"
134,Jaigarh fort ,This fort is left to disrepair where we were repeatedly pushed to get a guide. The view however of Amber Fort were amazing and worth the 200 Rupees.
135,Great views of Jaipur,"This is one of the place where many battles been fought in Past India, and many victories as well as losses are been witnessed by this place, it is one of the best place to visit and to know the history and stories of the Great Kingdom regime."
136,Disappointing,"A beautiful fort with mark of grandeur all over it.. You enter the main visiting area of the fort through a labyrinth which gives you access to different parts like Kitchen, Dining area, Queen's palace etc. Although not much of the structure is left it gives you a perfect glimpse of what it had been in its full glory... Vast, beautiful and wisely designed for protection as well as public welfare (the water storage area for example). The view of the protective wall and pathway spread across multiple hills around and the Amer Palace below takes you back in history. There are ample photo opportunities so visitors keep your camera handy :)Couple of things to keep in mind, It is quite a long walk to cover the fort area so you might want to brief the senior travelersKeep an eye on the children (if you are traveling with any) as there is a labyrinth and some steep areas around You can take your vehicle inside the main entrance, ask at the ticketing officeGuide may not be required however absolutely upto you :)"
137,Awesome historical place,An amazing visit to one of the THE places to visit when in Jaipur.Steeped in regal history this fort is a must visit for all historians.
138,City View of Jaipur,"Jaigarh Fort, which is a part of the same complex as that of Amer Fort, as the two are connected by a subterranean passage. The passage was meant to evacuate the royal family in case of an attack on Amber Palace. The 18th-century tunnel was thrown open to the public and has been…"
139,Biggest fort in jaipur,I am giving Jaigarh fort 3 stars out of 5. Because very few things to see and there are in very bad condition. I prefer walking from Amer fort and it's really good and satisfying if you just want to do adventures. So I would suggest if you're free then you can go or else better to go to Nahargarh fort.
140,Very interesting ,"I would put this as a must see fort for 2 reasons, beautiful views from the top, biggest canon. Basically this fort was constructed for defense purposes and safety of Amber palace. Primarily used by soldiers and other commanders in those times. The views all around especially that of Amber palace, the Aravalli mountains and Jal Mahal from here are breathtaking. You can use your vehicle to drive to the top of the fort with some additional 100/- entry ticket for the vehicle."
141,Nice Fort ,"Went up to Jaigarh Fort to check out the view overseeing Amber Fort, and found out about this mini Great Wall of China (see picture). Beautiful walls, and when I googled, I realised there was actually a Great Wall of India located at Kumbhalgarh Fort. Too far from Jaipur - a 6.5…"
142,Nothing special ,"The Jaigarh Fort was built in 1726 and was never captured, it has withstood the test of time. You will walk up hill about 2/3 mile to reach the fort.  The watchtower offers stunning views.This fort holds the worlds largest wheeled cannon...it was made at the forts foundry.Inside of the fort is an armory and a museum.Fee: 200 rupees (about $2.75 USD)"
143,World's largest canon on wheels,"Enjoy the hill drive in JAIPUR to reach this place!Jaigarh hosts Jaivana, the largest cannon in the world.Have a look at the city from the top of the hill, its beautiful. But do check the timings for the fort, before you organise the same."
144,Glorious fort,"One of the non-glamorous forts in Jaipur , it is home of  one of the star attractions of Jaipur i.e 50 tons canon known as “Jai Ban”. The route to fort is through narrow road and one can take rickshaw from Amer fort to reach there. Entries are permitted till 5:00 pm. It also…"
145,Off the beaten track and great views ,We walked up the road from Amer Fort which took 15-20 mins. The fort isn’t in great shape but the view is really nice. Beware of fake guides we thought this man worked here (he looked quite official) and he told us about the cannons for about 5 mins then pestered us about a tip. Also be careful of the monkeys !
146,Historic place suitable for short visit,"Jaigarh Ft is amongst popular traveler locations in Jaipur, the Pink City. Famous for its historic relevance, this ft has a lot of points to use you. It is likewise a hillside leading ft as well as there are 2 methods to go into in it. You could individually go into in the ft or you could get in the ft by means of Brownish-yellow Ft. There is a passage which leads straight to the ft which lies in Brownish-yellow Ft. The passage which is completely covered, after some range opens from leading as well as looks a lot more like a hallway. You could appreciate breath-taking sight of Jaipur city from this location.Excellent historic royal residence. Extremely massive. The most effective water harvesting and also water monitoring system one could see here.that must consisted of as a task research study in our colleges. Canon shop is impressive. Administration needs to offer little even more info concerning functioning of factory."
147,The royal getaway,The elevation of the fort is higher than Amber fort. AMBER Fort is visible from here. The approach is through the ghat section steep. Its a good place to be. The car can go up to the cannon. It houses the world's largest cannon which is what is the main attraction. Rest is the good views. The fort gas a small restaurant above. over all a peaceful place.
148,Holidays,Beautiful view from the fort. Very interesting story about the making of Biggest Cannon. You can take your car inside the fort.
149,"Fort with iconic view of Green mountain, Amber Fort, Biggest Canon and water storage to view",The only attraction of this place is the Cannon which is said to be one of the largest in the world.  Private cars can go right upto the courtyard(parking extra) of the cannon otherwise it can also be parked outside from where it is about 350metres walk.
150,Amazing fort in Jaipur ,This fort overlooks the Amer Fort. It has the world's largest cannon on wheels. So this may be the only reason you should visit this fort. It's not as majestic as the Amer Fort but you can definitely appreciate  the architecture and majestic walls of this fortClimate was hot but view from top are best.
151,Great for history buffs,"Great place, do not miss it. We visited Jaigarh Fort after Amber Fort. You can reach it by foot through the tunnel, approx. 30 min walk, but we did not like a dark tunnel and too crowded.. so we took a rickshaw to bring us to the parking of the fort, just 10 min ride up the…"
152,Excellent View of Amber Fort and City from top,"If you are going to Amber Fort don't miss this palace, this is situated little away. This palace has a great history. You can find your way if you are very keen you can get a guide ( Not mandatory),"
153,Amazing fort with Big Cannon,"Perched much higher than the Amber Fort, the Jaigarh fort offer impressive views over the Amber fort and over Jaipur itself.Whilst not as spectacular as Amber or as well maintained it is a worthwhile visit nonetheless. We were excited about seeing 'the largest cannon on wheels' at the fort. However, the way they have displayed it is a shame. It is under a sloping tin roof and as such the viewing of it is hindered. The exhibit could be much more spectacular with more planning.   Overall well worth a visit, a guide isn't necessary (recommend for Amber) and worth doing as part of the 3 fort tour."
154,Nice place ,"If you are in Jaipur then you might have to visit all the Forts to compare or else as 1st time visitor you will be amazed with any of the Forts you visit first. This Fort again has lot of history & the guards are very helpful inside the Fort. But, if you are interested in…"
155,Real Fort...,Twhe main attraction of this place jaivana cannan.  I don't think this place is worth visiting..  Nothing special. You can easily skin this place.  There are many other beautiful places in Jaipur other than this
156,Jaigarh,We went with family for holidays there...nice fort ..on one side of nahargarh fort...there you can see biggest toap ...must visit 👍
157,Good view from top,This Fort is connected to the Amber Fort and can be reached there by walking. There is a small forest near the area. 
158,Amazing,"It is a bit away from the city but is worth the trip. World's biggest cannon is definitely a big draw. There is a tunnel that goes all the way to the Amber Palace. Looking at the forge that was used to build cannons is a must. However, the entrance is not well-maintained. One…"
159,Stunning views ,"Just located few kms away from Amber Fort, it’s a nice place to visit! You can walk here through a tunnel that connects both Forts. "
160,Beautiful Sightseeing,"One more neglected by tourist place, or even if they visit, they just visit the Jaivana Cannon and go back. But this fort is much more than the cannon. It has fantastic view of the Amer gad, the great wall of Amer, the dark rooms complex structure ( the maze or bhulbullaiya),…"
161,victory fort,The fort is next to Amber fort and you can take your car inside the fort only to see the cannon. Entry for car inside is at a cost.Can be avoided if there is time constraint.
162,Hill top Fort ,"This is a very nice fort atop Amber Fort. This was where the army was stationed to keep a watch over Amber Fort/ Palace. Extremely well maintained, this Fort will take you back in time. A must visit after visiting Amber Fort"
163,the biggest cannon in the world,This place is one of the epic and is a Rajputana Aan Baan aur Shan ko yahan aa kar mahsoos kare. Makes you feel proud and inseparable part of magnanimous History we had.
164,A history of a respected kingdom,If you like a big cannon than this is the fort for you. Similar designs and structures to the other forts in this area but it has the cannon to set it apart. The cannon is show and tell only there are no live demonstrations of the cannons power. For the traveller this fort is…
165,Lovely history,"We came to this fort after visiting Amber fort, and it is not as well maintained or presented. There were significantly less people here, and while walking around you are treated to stunning views of the Amber fort, Lake Palace and Jaipur city. It was a 15 minute uphill walk…"
166,Historical Place - Jaigarh Fort,Best place to see Jaipur city from the Jaigarh Fort.View was really amazing and breathtaking. best time to visit on weekend before 1 oclock in the afternoon.
167,Nothing much to see other than largest canon,"On the way from Nahargarh Fort, you can visit Jaigarh fort. Movies like Khuda Gawah , Kranti scenes had been shot here. You may pay 50 rupees for guide charges. Get a glimpse of largest cannon of the world. Large water purifier tanks with the contemporary methodology."
168,"Exclusively built, rich in history","Of the tree major forts, this one is the most interesting. Helpful staff willing to share info with tourists But make sure you wear comfortable shoes as you need to walk a lot"
169,Architecture marvel,"Amber Fort is so stunning, that by comparison this fort is grubby, littered and has very little to see. It is quite a tough walk, especially in the heat, and whilst the trek offers beautiful views it is not worth paying the money to enter. very poorly maintained, and there were lots of guards trying to trick you into giving them tips if you went anywhere."
170,Very impressive,Good for a short visit. Gun which was used by the Maharajas is displayed. Majestic piece of war equipment. Must visit
171,Jaigarh fort - The other fort,The fort is massive and really well maintained even today. The smallish museum at the fort showcases the artillery used by the maharajas of Jaipur. The grand canon is really huge and worth seeing. 
172,Stunning fort with a mamoth Canon,"all military personals and army used to stay here and prepare. old canons and weapons will be seen in exhibition, biggest canon jaiwana also here.."
173,Good one to start with,The person who are enthusiastic about old history of Indian kingdoms they only should visit the place. The most positive thing about this place are you can go by car at the top of  the Fort.  You have to give entry fees for you and your car also for that.
174,Jaigarh Fort,"If you want great of Jaipur, this is must visit place. Haveli and mahal is well maintained. Please avoid wax museum and shish mahal(over fees and not that worth)."
175,Average,Yeah you read correct .. We can witness the largest biggest sure shot cannon in the world . It weights more than 50-60 tonnes .. We can have the best view of jaipur from this fort .. Jaigarh fort is some hundred years old fort .. one of the best in pink city and it should  be on…
176,Good,"Visited here for a couple of hours one afternoon while in Jaipur.  It is probably the least busy of the many forts in Jaipur but that was a plus point.  Entry was 100 rupees per person for a foreigner and it was 20 rupees for car parking.  This fort also houses the world's largest canon, but it was never fired in anger.  What I liked about this fort was that you were able to clamber on the walls and ramparts, and unlike other sites in Jaipur you were not bothered by hawkers.  There were lots of monkeys roaming around as well, mainly the dark faced langurs but also the odd macaque.  There was also a couple of places to eat within the fort, there was a snack bar serving samosas etc but also a cafe where we sat and had a beer and some butter naan breads.  The cafe did a full menu of curries etc.  The fort is fairly close to the Amber Fort, about a 20 min drive from the city centre."
177,Worth a visit...great views,Another spectacular fort in Jaipur.  The view are breathtaking and it is amazing to see the fort in such good condition. It is certainly worth a visit when in Jaipur.  
178,Giant fort!,Nice experience! Specially the hilly way up to Jaigarh fort is  more interesting with peacocks running here and there - can take some lovely pictures.
179,The gaurd fort of Amber fort,"Went there in the evening & got some really good views. This fort is at a height vis-a-vis Amber fort. The 'world's biggest moving' canon is a must-see.    But apparently this is in control of some private party (royal lineage, i guess). When we went, there was marriage lined up…"
180,Beautiful,"Jaigarh Fort is situated on  Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) of the Aravalli range; it overlooks the Amer Fort & the Maota Lake. Built by Jai Singh II in 1726 to protect the Amer Fort. Famous for the World's largest cannon on the wheels - ""Jaivana "". There is a tunnel that…"
181,Amazing Fort,The palace where you can see ancient history of rajputana....The entry ticket is ₹70 but it worth of ₹700...The fort is located on the top of amber fort....This fort was build to protect the palace....⛪🕌🕍..........There is a biggest cannon on wheel is available here....⚔️🔫🏹🛡️...
182,Spectacular views,"There are better forts for sure to be seen when you are visiting the beautiful city of Jaipur, this is not the best one."
183,Fort with Weapon ,Visited this historical monument with my family and guest from delhi... Everyone loved it and the collection is great...
184,JAIGARH FORT BUILT IN 1726 ..A SECURITY FOR THE RAJA JAI SINGH,We all know about the cultural heritage of Rajasthan and if you want to witness that in this 20 century then this is possible at this place.
185,nothing is left apart from the canon,A hauntingly beautiful fort with a number of interesting features and a spectacular view over the Amber Fort. Monkeys and parrots stalk its walls.
186,Fort with a massive Gun,We had  a such great view from this attraction. Located in city centre offeri g such great viewz. So good.
187,Good Place,walked off a few mango ladies. if you are in the amer fort there is no reason other than being in a rush not to see it. the triple archway way in a movie. marigold hotel 2 I believe.
188,Housr of the largest cannon on wheels in the world,It was my favourite in Jaipur . I visited here with my family. Entry fee is also not high it is around 25 . It was in word beautiful. Will like to visit here again
189,Historical Fort,Far from the City but ones you arrived on this place is breath taking though again its already ruined and needs rehabilitation but still it depicts the rich culture and history of the great Rajghput. It is managed privately by the current royal family. There a fee to get inside and the security guards are also the tourist guide which is also there like 15-20 years already and knows the history of the place. From photos it looks like little Great Wall of China of Jaipur.
190,nice fort,The main attraction is the huge cannon but the spectacular views and the fact that it was much less crowded than Amber Fort make this an attraction not to miss.
191,"Very Big, Historic and Beautiful Fort","You get to this place by walking through a tunnel from Amber Fort. The place is full of history and you get great views of Jaipur from several vantage points. It is well worth a visit, but be ready to walk. And you can either walk back, if you have the energy or you can take a tuk tuk."
192,Big & Beautiful,Nice place to visit with limited attractions apart from walking around the old fort and views of Jaipur the only other activity was the waxworks show.
193,good,I was totally stunned to have visited such an enormous fort which ordered majestic views of the entire city in all its zeal!
194,Good place to learn about Rajput history,Used Uber to get here as tuk tuk and taxi rates were high. Biggest cannon is interesting. Nice views of the lake and palace below. We started here in the morning and then walked down the path to the Amber fort below. If you're going to see both I highly recommend this as the walk is nice and the tunnel passage is interesting. Easy to get transportation at the bottom once you're done.
195,Jaigarh fort,Jaigarh fort is simply a Bhool Bhulaiya. It took me around 15-20mins to reach from one point to other as I many times lost the way. The view of the jaipur city is amazing from the top of the fort.Camel ride is a must ride if you are new to Jaipur. They charge 100rs for it.
196,Jaigarh Fort was excellnt place,"During my holidays in Jaipur, I had visited this huge fortress located on the top of a hill. Our car dropped us at the parking lot outside the tickets booking counter and from there we walked up on an inclined pathway to reach the topmost section of the fort where Jaivana, the…"
197,Jaigarh fort,Closest to Amber Fort. More height than Amber.Nothing extraordinary except a canon and a huge water tank. of course an Arial view (partial) of Jaipur city.  Nothing in comparison to Amber Fort.
198,lovely fort with great views,"If you have chance, drive up the hill above Amber to this fort which dates from 1726. You can see the world's largest wheeled cannon. Beyond that is a series of rooms and corridors, some containing the armoury and other artefacts. It opens out into a hidden garden and fantastic panoramas over Amber and the fortress walls, so you really get to see the scale of the construction."
199,Cannon,A lovely place full of traditional history. You will need a local guide they charged us 300 rupees for a group of 4.
200,Impressive Hill Top Fort,"The fort on top of a hill above the Amber Palace and can reached by a 1km walk up the hill.Although the fort is large, the only interesting things are the views and the gardens. Otherwise there is not much else.Probably not worth the walk"
201,An interesting fort with a grand view.,There is nothing much to see in this fort other than the largest Canon of the world. it's at topmost height of Amer other than that nothing to see.
202,Not good,Its really worth travelling to have a view from top of the city and surroundings. The historical lineage is well depicted
203,Visit only to see world’s largest cannon,We were thrilled to get a chance to visit Jaigarh. As you visit the Amber Fort you see the other forts on the ridgelines.It was hard to get to but the locals did not steer us wrong.
204,Nice historic place,This fort was astonishing!  With proper guide you can get great information about it and learn lots.   If you are not so interested I. The fort itself then I can say that the view from this fort is astonishing :).   Here you can find lots of helpful guides to show around :).  
205,Amazing views from the top,Was unable to visit the inside as our guide said we cannot go into many areas plus fees were very high so skipped it but took photos from outside.
206,The largest Cannon in the World,"A good place, little isolated now as compare to Amer palace. But you will get good view of Amer palace from here. Visit only if you don't have time constraint, else even skipping it won't hurt."
207,Pleasant Surprise - Learn About the Forts of India.....,"You can find world's biggest cannon; and the 60 gallon water storage underground tank and the Great Wall protecting the fort. If you don't have time, you can skip it as see other places."
208,The World' Largest Canonball on Wheels,200 rupees to enter. Go early morning as it gets very hot after noon. We took a tuktuk up and it felt a little 'hairy' in places but drivers are experienced so no reason to be alarmed. There's a small restaurant there (we didn't try) and a place selling spicy puff potato fare (20 rupees each). Views across to Amber Fort are amazing. Worth the money. Suitable footwear a must!
209,A view from top is worth all the efforts,"Although it is not as popular as the Amber Fort down below, this fort has it's own charm. The ""Jaivana"" : largest Canon on Wheels is present here. The fort offers a very nice view of the Amber Fort and the entire hills around it. I would recommend a visit to this fort on your…"
210,Nahargarh fort trek...,"One fort where originality has been maintained and felt there was a clear attempt to preserve the history and culture.In the scorching heat, the walk around the wonderful fort from the entrance gate with breathtaking view from the top was fully appreciated.The largest cannon on display was a wonderful attraction."
211,Surprisingly interesting,"Although there is nothing much remained on this fort,except the canon, but the fort walls and its vast expanse gives you an idea of how it will be when it was functioning. If you are looking for signs of royalty and their lifestyle symbols, don't visit this fort. This fort is built to protect Amer palace/fort below (Jaigarh fort overlooks Amer Palace). Once can visualize vision of the king which has built this fort and protective wall which goes around Amer (around 12km). Its open with lots of walking around the outer walls. The canon is also worth seeing. If you love photography, this fort provides amazing angles of various structures."
212,Good view - but not worth going inside,"Go first to amer and then walk up to jaigarh fort. You will have a beautiful view over Jaipur, the Mountains and amer fort. Loved it!"
213,Nice Fort,"Though it's has nothing much to do...the size of the fort is magnificent. You can also take a look at the big cannon.It's not so crowded like Amer fort, so maybe you can enjoy solitude here."
214,Jaigarh fort ,Good must visit in winter healthy weather good food chill in the air all adds to make it excellent you can forgrt your worries and just chill out with friends and family
215,History in Any form is a thing of Beauty,It was great tour. My family member very happy. Sankar is a great person. He know evry thing. No need guide. Sankar is a honest person.Thanks
216,Nice Fort,This is a nice place and must place to visit if you are in Jaipur. There are public transport available to this place but you can book a cab too .   
217,One of the delights of India,"I visited this fort on a previous visit to Jaipur.  While not as restored or well kept as the Amber Fort, if time permits it is interesting to see."
218,Historical Heritage monument,The only thing i liked there was the presence of big Canon. The canon was located on one side of this fort. You can skip this place if you are tight on schedule.
219,for best view of Jaipur!!,For indian nationality adult ticket is 70 rs per person.5 years old kids are free.and students id get have discount for entry tickets.
220,Jaigarh fort- Historic place,If you have time do visit this Ford it's very nearby to Amber fort. Either you can got out (exit the fort ) and take cab to visit jaighar else there's a way from Amber fort which will take not more than 20 minutes and it's amazing too to go via walking. Entry fee is 40 or 50 RS.
221,Old fort,Great views here. We walked up from Amber fort through the tunnel (mostly outside/uncovered tunnel- a nice walk). A gentleman dressed in a guard uniform gave us a tour which was helpful; it’s a big place and not well marked. Interesting and ancient. Enjoyed seeing the monkeys there too.  Good food at the restaurant there.
222,It's okay to aovid,"Worlds bighest cannon that too target only.once in life , there u can understand history and manufacturing process of diffrent diffrent canons "
223,Fantastic views,the cannon foundry is one of its kind in the country and well worth a visit. the fort offers fantastic views from the top. the walls are amazing as they climb the hills
224,Visit at Leasst One of the High Forts,Very beautiful place to visit- the craftsmanship on so many levels is amazing- and great view of the area-  Fun elephant ride to get to the top too!!
225,The cannon alone is worth the visit,If you have three hours you will be pleasantly surprised by military history & the scenic panaramic views from this ugly fort which overlook the beautiful Amber Palace Fort.  You would be wasting your time to stop here for 10 min.  We were the only foreigners visiting this fort…
226,Jaigarh fort.,"Lack of effort to maintain such an amazing fort!! Fort looks quite tattered and very poorly looked after.... The centre of attraction is the canon, which is claimed to be the world's biggest!!!"
227,Worth a visit....must see when in Jaipur,Another fort and more great architecture.  Also more great photo opportunities.  Worth a visit.  Included in the 2 day ticket cost.  
228,Worth a visit,dont miss this fort hire a guide well explianed by them only need minumum 1 hour to see this fully also car goes right uphill good road 
229,Good,One of the historical places to visit in Jaipur. The right time to visit would be in rain or in winter .Good places visit with family and friends...
230,Originality,was at a Musical Night around 9 PM onwards . good Lighting and great ambience .  cool breeze at this height adds to the pleasure
231,Jaipur City Birds Eye View,"Commercialized fort with a restraunt,wax museum and some other activites .you can skip it if you have visited amer and nahargarh"
232,Wonderful views from this vantage point!,"Thursday 15th February and we hired a taxi for the day, about 1,000 Rupees, used Ola Rental, to continue our sightseeing tour around Jaipur. Our first stop of the day was a Jaigarth Fort which is situated about 14 kilometres from the City. It took about an hour to get there,…"
233,View! View! View!,For some reason not that many people go up here. That's their loss! This is a large historical military complex that is well worth exploring in full. The real highlight is right at the end high point with beautiful battlements encircling a lovely garden. Don't leave without finding it as many seem to do. One downside of this site is that they allow cars to drive in for a fee which somewhat spoiled the ambience of some of the more accessible locations. You really don't need a guide here as long as you do a bit of reading before visiting…
234,Must visit!,One of the old amer heritages which is an architectural beauty showing the grandeur and glory of that time period.
235,Tunnel to Amber Fort,"Before exiting Amer (Amber) fort/palace (where the art gallery is) there is a sign for part underground, part open path that leads all the way up the hill to Jaigarh Fort. It seems that not a lot of people knew about it since we were the only one at the time walking up the hill. I liked the walk and the views along the path were just amazing!! Not sure how long it took us in total perhaps 40min to get from the palace exit to the Jaigarh Fort. If I am not mistaken for foreigners the entrance fee for Jaigarh Fort was 200INR (or 300INR). The forth is not well preserved (the biggest attraction might be a cannon) and there is not much to see expect the views which are amazing. There are toilets (in a good conditions). Parking is available just outside the fort. After seeing Amer palace/fort I would say it is not worth the entrance fee nor the time as it does not add much to the experiences."
236,Awesome views of Jaipur,"Had a lovely walk round here, amazing views interesting history, March is a lovely month to visit as it’s not too busy or hot. highly recommend a visit!! "
237,Royal...,If you are not into visiting structure or old building then the only thing I liked is the biggest canon ...
238,Should not be missed!,Good  but lots of places are kept clean Which is sad. Could be better.   Some hotels are good. Don't go for v cheap ones
239,must see in jaipur,This is one of the fort you'd not want to miss visiting and is located conveniently near the Nahargarh and Amber fort.
240,One the best places in Jaipur ,"It took us about 15 minutes from amber fort to climb up. There is a part where you can climb up a steep hill of loose stones/rocks which if you can do it brings you closer to the top quicker, but you can also walk around on slope around the edges which i would reccomend for coming back down. It costs 100 rupees to enter. The fort is old and ancient looking, but there is tons of peoples names scratched onto the outsides of the walls around the fort, it is covered in it, which i think kind of wrecks the authenticity of the fort. The views from here are amazing and I would generally recommend it for people who want to see a good view of amber fort and surrounding amer, jaipur areas. We saw a monkey up here, who was just sitting looking out at the views just like everyone else was. I would reccomend 2 hours, including walking from amber fort, looking around her pe and then walking back down to amber fort. So overall i would say it was definitely worth the money, the time and effort to walk up here from amber fort if you have the time."
241,Atop amber fort,"If you have already visited Amer before this, then this fort will underwhelm. However, its now home to Jaivana - the biggest cannon of its time."
242,Good Ambience with lighting at Night,The Jaigarh fort was lots of fun with plenty of places to explore and a beautiful view of the surrounding woodland. It is home to the world’s largest cannon. It is also home to a LOT of monkeys. WARNING- there is no phone signal there! That means that you can not call an Uber/Ola and are left to the mercy of rude auto walas who are looking to take advantage of foreigners. My friends and I ended up walking a couple kilometers until we got phone service and were able to call a car.
243,Great Fort,When i visited jaipur it was one of the place which was in my mind... My partner too liked it as we were able to see the complete view of jaipur
244,Fascinating Old Fort,Actually I missed it Im taking this opportunity that nobody should miss this place. a lot of walking is needed....
245,A blast from the Raja's,Beautiful fort! The drive up to the fort was beautiful! You can walk through the fort or drive through it. I’m glad we walked even though it was 90 degrees outside. Loved seeing the monkeys! 
246,nice views,"There is not much to see in this place compared to what Jaipur has in its hat. I would recommend you to visit this place first before Nahargarh, Amer, City Palace so that best can be kept in order."
247,A fort to visit,Not as busy as many of the other forts. Definitely worth going. Was not expensive to go in and some good photo opportunities.
248,One of three...,Not much to be seen in the fort except for the beautiful sceneries and views.The history isn't that big. But it's worth a visit as it's close to the Amber and Nahargarh forts ... so while you are on the way you might as well continue the visit.The water wells were really huge and worth to experience though.make sure some guide is there to tell you anything really LOL
249,Memorable,"Brilliantly designed!the largest cannon in the world. Carry water bottle,cap/hat sunglasses with you.  My friends and I enjoyed there."
250,"Old fort, above amber fort, amazing views.",Just visit Amber fort and you are done. No other fort can satisfy you if you spent a good time at Amber fort.
251,Nice view of amber fort ,Forts in Rajasthan should be covered either in early morning (Jaigarh opens at 9.30 AM) or in late evening to avoid the sun. In Jaigarh fort one needs to walk long distance in order to explore the full fort. It was mainly the cannon making factory and soldiers used to stay in Jaigarh fort. The bhulbhulaiya inside is another notable place along with the largest cannon inside the fort. It is near to Amer fort and both are interlinked by a road for pedestrian though few take the road. The view from the end point of Amer fort from Jaigarh is a nice one.
252,Worlds biggest Canon enjoy,"Above Amber Fort and perhaps a 800 metre walk up a medium incline (auto-rickshaws are available) the Fort overlooks the main attraction.  However, it's got little or no historical information displayed and it's been largely left as it was.  Don't bother entering, you can see the…"
253,Best fort in Jaipur,I hope it's too much hot there so am not able to come next time it was nice place but I can't survive better to ...............  ..............          ............................
254,Worlds largest cannon in here.,The Amber Fort is spectacular and this is just a small part of what it has to offer. I highly recommend seeing it all. You will be amazed at this spectacular place! I highly recommend it.
255,Should visit once for sure,"A very well maintained fort, where the King's guards still live with their families. Excellend millitary architecture - amazing the way soldiers in the 17th - 18th century used to evade enemies by using hot oil from the walls. The largest cannon in the world, weighing more than 100 tons ""Jaivana"" was amazing to see. Check out the amazing sarees and quilts available in the handicraft shop owned by the king, inside the Jaigarh fort.…"
256,Amazing Fort in Jaipur and fun Elephant rides,"Warren and maze of corridors,rooms and staircases with little to see.The sunken is inaccessible because used for filming often,a shame..."
257,Worth a visit ,What an amazing fort is this. It's very huge and require almost half a day to see it properly.Its managed by the royal family so very well maintained.
258,longest fort,After all the other forts this is a bit of a let down and crying out for investment as it’s potential is amazing. I think the highlight is really the views of the Amer fort below which is really the only reason to go there which is s shame and so much rubbish but you only pay…
259,Poorly Maintained!!,Though we travelled during the off season and it was hot but the view and the scenic beauty of the place came through even during the warm evenings @ Amber Fort.
260,Beautiful Citadel,We went up to the fort and were a bit disappointed. It’s very huge and there’s actually not much to see. You can enjoy a nice view over Jaipur or the Amber fort but that’s it. The fort is old and not well treated.
261,Good place.,"a must visit on your trip to jaipur with some time on your hands.. especially great fun when visiting with people who has an eye to history.. magnificence of the bygone era is evident in every nook n corner of the fort.. pride of jaipur, must say.."
262,Well worth the extra effort,get there around dusk since the place is super hot during the day and in evenings it cools a bit. This place closes around 6p - so make sure you go around 4.30 or so to enjoy the place and also the breeze from the top.  This place also provides good photo op opportunities as…
263,Beautiful fort,Great to see the biggest canon on wheels on earth.... Amazed with the historical facts of places... A day we'll spent.  
264,Canon fort,If you have time visit this place. It has got the world's biggest Canon and they are on wheels. Was happy to see that we Indians could make such a magnificent stuff even years ago when there wasn't much technology.
265,Another Rajasthan Fort - Must Visit,When reviewing a monument/historical attraction in India it is difficult not to seem like you are repeating yourself.   Jaipur is an incredible state with so much history in this area. If you make the effort to visit Amber Palace/Fort then go the little bit further and see the…
266,Excellent Fort for Sight Seeing and Spending Time,"Some may not agree because it may not look as grand as other forts, but in my opinion this is a must visit fort in Jaipur. This is because this is the real fort and not just palace. This is the place where soldiers were stationed and trained to fight wars. This is a huge place and you may want to keep full half day to see it. You can see the tank system to store water, the meeting place for the raja with his subjects, the dining place, the alternative palaces of the king and queen, and last but not the least, the largest canon in the world. Hear about the myths around the tank and the canon, and you will enjoy it. Suggest to engage the local official folks to serve as a guide and surprisingly they are pretty inexpensive. You can have a camel ride too if you wish inside the fort. Have a birds eye view of Jaipur from atop. Overall, enjoyed every bit of it."
267,Great Fort,Accept for the wax museum the place is worth a visit. Good to see corporate involvement in the restoration process. Liked the exhibits..
268,Majestic!,This was a great place to visit with more locals than foreigners visiting.  There was a great modernist sculpture exhibition housed within the building and a nice café in the Kings section of the palace.  The wax works we didn't venture into.A good example of a step well if you don't see one elsewhere.  Don't miss the abseiling monkeys.
269,Better than Amber Fort,"Our visit was made memorable by our guide, hansraj  gujjar, who offered us beautiful and detailed description of the this place."
270,Just Awesome,"if you are travelling with your best friends then pleasae go for it, ensure that you are not travelling at very hot weather, the best time to go is during winter or any day after 4pm"
271,Wonder of the world with world's largest cannon on wheels built in 1720.,"Amer gets spoken about the most, but all three forts are amazing. The views are simply mind-blowing and the restaurant there has the best of them. The food was also nice."
272,Visit in the evenings,"The place ain't got much except it houses the largest damn cannon on wheels in this world. This fort was the military fort and it was heavily fortified. The cannon, Jaivana was built by King Sawai Man Singh 2. During a test fire, this cannon made such an orotund that there never came an opportunity to put this daddy to use. Poor frightened enemy souls. 😋You do get to see the great Wall built around Amer and the famed underground water reservoirs where the treasury lay. It is believed that, to remove a single gold coin, you had to empty the entire reservoir. Of course, like all other treasuries and wealth of the then era, this lies forlorn and empty. Some say that during the emergency declared by Indira Gandhi, the treasure was confiscated in truckloads. There is also the belief that the treasure was used by King Sawai Jai Singh to build the city we now know as Jaipur. The histories of my country always intrigues me which is the reason I love such visits and tours."
273,Mr,"This is a fantastic place for history buffs and anyone with even a mild curiosity for the history of Rajasthan. So much information to take in, well worth a visit!"
274,Impressive ,"The sheer size of this fort would drop anyone's jaw. It covers almost the entire hill it is sitting on. There are many features of the fort designed to make invasion difficult. The most impressive is that it has a few staircase wells that draw water from the surrounding hills. Thus, while land surrounding the fort will be dried of water, the fort is well supplied with running water."
275,Oh boy this place is stunning,Nice historic place to visit. The good thing is that you can drive your own vehicle inside the fort. Gives you a royal feeling. Please don't go for the restaurants inside as the food is pathetic and didn't notice much hygiene too.
276,Be prepared to walk a lot to get a great view of Jaipur,"Must see places in Jaipur and have some time to walk around and enjoy. If you are visiting in winter, enjoy the chill on the hill."
277,JAIGARH FORT,Just another amazing place to visit. You could spend hours wondering around. It is big too. A lot of history too. Must do this one & Amber Fort together in the same day. You also have a museum and an armoury exhibition.
278,Palace of Maharaja,"great to get up here and see the views.  It's a lot further than the Amber Fort and it's more up-hill to reach this than the Amber Fort so whilst you might pay 200IR to get to AF, it will be more like 500IR to get up here.  There's not really much need for a guide if you've been to some of the other palaces and forts.  Official guides will try to tag on to you even once you're inside the complex.  The only way to get rid of them is to say 'I go on my own'.  I was told this by a tuctuc driver and it did indeed seem to work where everything else that I'd politely told them didn't. We ate in the food court - which I can't recommend.  We had a look at the (expensive) restaurant but 1. it didn't look all that and 2. it was empty at lunch time which was a poor sign."
279,Must Visit Place in Jaipur,My wife and I got an auto-rikshaw here in the early morning - the best time to go -Entry fee is 200 IRS. The fort is much bigger than we anticipated - with many different courtyards - Much of the fortification is in disrepair with no sign of any restoration work. It is here the…
280,So worth the extra 2 km walk from the Amber Palace!,Different people have different taste and different interest. But when it comes to visit new places almost all people like it. Few places are historical which is worth visit. This place is also one of the such place which is worth visit.  This is not the such place for which you come to visit from another country. But this is the place that if you plan the trip to JAIPUR or living new Jaipur then you must visit this place also. Have camel ride. Inside have the fort which is neat and clean as well as have long walk way and puppet show and many shops.
281,Historical place with good views & still private property,It is always a pleasure to visit some historical places in any cities I visited. this time I would not skip my trip to Jaigarh Fort. Dont skip the elephant ride that will take you to the Fort's gate. it is a must experience that you should not miss while in Jaipur.
282,Huge and impressive with a Big Cannon,Nice place to visit..Prefer take the car inside the fort...Very hot during the day...Not so well maintained.Could be maintained much better..Every other person is a tour or a guide and just fall behind you and keep forcing you avail there service..which after some time becomes a harassment...Make you be straight and avoid them up front...we'll finally good place...The restaurant in the premises can be well maintained and the rates he charges is 3 or 4 start rates...Avoid eating there
283,A Great Fort,"Amazing views down on Amber Palace, intriguing medieval fortifications and the world's heaviest wheel-mounted cannon"
284,Good 2-3 hour visit to this fort,"If running of time, it's oaky to avoid. Same old... same old. Nothing specific in comparison to another wonderful place in Jaipur."
285,Interesting place to see.,If you are an Indian heritage lover than you can spend your entire day here without getting bored. I just loved this place and I just loved clicking pictures too. If you're planning a trip to Jaipur then you must cover this place.
286,Historical place to visit in jaipur ,"Steeped in history, a visit to this fort is well worth the effort. The views are exceptional. Look down at the Amer fort, the gardens and do not forget to visit the cannon foundry which manufactured the largest cannon in the world!"
287,Excellent Architecture!!,You can visit it either on foot or by car. Entrance fee 100 INR and 20 more for the parking... Nice view towards Jal Mahal anss Jaipur City. There is the world's largest Canonball on wheels up to the fort. Choose either Jaigarth or Nahargarh fort if you dont have much time to…
288,Weird food court and empty restaurant,It may not be the best but the history embedded in its walls and the feel you get when you are here is an experience worth having.Nice place and nice view from top.
289,Amazing Ariel view of old Jaipur & Amber Ford,This is a must see.  It was mind blowing to see how the royality of India lived.  make sure you take a tour otherwise its hard to get a complete picture of the histoery.
290,Jaigarh Fort,"We had our guide take us to this site by car.  Per his story, it can be reached on foot from Amber Fort.  Once here, we had spectacular views from multiple sites.  Self or guided tours can be done, some steps required, and many uncovered areas to consider.  Not nearly as crowded or touristy as fort below, but well worth a walk!"
291,Very Big Fort,"Once again the guides are a big let down for the knowledgeable tourist. Hyping up doesn't sell anymore.... when will the tourism authorities learn this. They really need to get their research right and educate the guides. This is NOT the largest/longest /biggest cannon in the world. It was so but only in the period of its manufacture. It's armament.... 50kg iron ball......seriously, that's it. So please cut or the tall stories spun around it's firing and effect etc etc etc. Water management part of the fort is interesting. Maintenance is very poor with filth and junk lying all around... big eye sore. Museum of arms.. Just OK. Walk from this place to Amber Fort via the tunnel is highly recommended."
292,Isnt a very much important sight in Jaipur.,It is very near to Amber fort. You can take a cab to reach there. But I preferred to walk. There is a direct subway from Amber to Jaigarh Fort. I really liked and enjoyed walking well structured historical alley. The most interest thing about Jaigarh Fort is that you can see…
293,Combine with a trip to Amber Fort,Could do better. Very amaturish presentation and total lack of signage. Save your $$$ and stay clear
294,Jaigarh,I must admit the main attraction here was a slight disappointment. The canon had graffiti on. However from the other side of the fort you get the most stunning views of Amber fort which was really worth it.
295,Average place,"Although much of the internal features are no more, it proved much more interesting than expected. fortunately much can be driven. The museum is disappointing but the 'residential' wing is enlightening"
296,Worth a visit,Loved the rustic feel to the place.  Take a guide if you want to know more about the fort.   Brilliant place for photoshoots.  Awesome place 
297,Must Visit Fort in Jaipur : #Jaivana,"I would suggest to wait until you've almost finished your tour of the Amber Fort before you take a decision on whether you go to Jaigarh Fort. If you're exhausted already, give it a miss. If you're fired up for more forts, then walk on up the hill to Jaigarh where the entrance fees are quite modest and you can get some great views over Amber Fort below.Compared to the luxury and fancy decorations of Amber, Jaigarh is less swanky but that's because it's a defensive fort and built to house the military. You'll find a massive canon and lots of assorted swords and other armoury."
298,World 's largest Cannon.,"Our driver recommended heading up to see sunset from here. It didn’t disappoint. You can spend half an hour or so looking around the fort - free entry. Then sunset point has entry fee (Rs 400 or so for foreigners). It was worth it though, we found a nice seat and enjoyed looking out across the whole of Jaipur watching the sun go down while drinking Kingfishers. Stayed until it was dark then drove down again. We saw some tuk tuks make it up but we were in a car. Takes around 20 minutes from Pink City. Police were checking everyone on the way down to make sure drivers were not drunk."
299,Go through the tunnel,"If you have time, apart from the usual guided tours, a drive up to this place affords magnificent views, the best breezes on a hot day (I went near sunset) and a surprise gem of a place - a gorgeous garden with views of the mountains.  It looked to me like an impossible movie set."
