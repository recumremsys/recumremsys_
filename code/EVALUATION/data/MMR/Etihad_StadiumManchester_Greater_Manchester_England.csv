0,Brilliant venue ,"Easy accessible either by walking from Manchester (15 minutes), the tram or lots of the parking nearby. It's usually clean, tidy and the toilets in particular are as good as I've seen in a stadium. Staff tend to be helpful if you need them."
1,Mind Blowing and I loved it,"Stadium and Academy tour.Transport easy from around greater Manchester. Tram from city centre or outlying areas stops at the Etihad Stadium, frequent buses, even go by narrowboat , if you know any owners. Tours booked in at megastore, pass gives you 10% off any purchases.Escorted by Jim and Cameron our two excellent and informative guides for the 2hr. tour.First over the bridge connecting the stadium to the academy grounds.Ideas taken from major clubs around the world and put in place, making it possibly the best facility in the world for football.Again the Stadium itself is ultra modern, dining areas, heated executive seats.Changing rooms large, with connecting gym for warm up area.A great tour and facility built on what once was a major industrial area of Manchester"
2,great experience for all ages,"Access to the ground direct by tram from City centre or outskirts, Direct to the City stadium's (own) station. A very short walk (up steps) into a welcoming, trouble free atmosphere with live entertainment and lots of fun and prizes for youngsters,Exciting fun for all. Many food outlets and shopping. And football of the highest quality in a world class stadium. Basic seats are great, top seats fantastic. As is the food in executive corporate areas I hear. Simply the best,"
3,Bit disappointing,Well organised and lots of cafes and restaurants for drinks and food. Lots of toilets and easy accessible by tram lines.
4,A truly fab experience,Great access to the stadium and asda/mcds nearby. Clean and plenty of bars/food and toilets. There was no smoking areas on the upper stands and no smoking inside. Well organised and staffed for entrance and exits.Prices of drinks/food are to be expected for football stadiums (on the steep side generally).Staff friendly and helpful in most cases.
5,The best place in the land and all the world,"went to the match ManCity-Wolverhampton. overall a very good experience. Stadium easy to reach by metrolink. Lots of activities and food options pre match. Stadium is large and modern. Very good staff, high level of security and pleasant atmosphere. I am from overseas and was impressed with the whole organization."
6,Simply a 'Rip Off',Went with family season ticket holders. Private Parking nearby cost £8 about fifteen minutes walk . Stadium has developed a real character and friendly atmosphere. Bag search by friendly efficient security staff. Seats very comfy compared to your usual seats. More room than at Old Trafford !! Fan areas are good seats in catering areas for people to sit in at half time and the burgers are real quality ! Pies are locally produced and tasty.Very slow service which seems to be a regular problem. There are a large number of ladies toilets which are clean and well stocked.Definitely generally better fan experience than other grounds speaking as a season ticket holder of another premiership club the Etihad is a good place to visit .  Large screens give good information and replays .Music is good including Oasis tracks.Fans are self deprecating and quite funny and friendly. As for the football that was also a better experience than most fans get 4-0 to City ...
7,Etihad Stadium,Very accessible from the hotel by tram. Late afternoon it was almost empty and could look at the arena without crowds. Of course an excursion is possible to book.
8,Watching Manchester City,This is a very nice stadium. I suggest taking the bus to go as the walk can be long. Also reserve online as least 24hrs in advance to visit.
9,Great Concert Venue,Great venue for the blue run.  Well organised  great atmosphere.  Easy to get to and plenty of parking.
10,Covid means no Ethiad this season,The best day ever and would encourage anyone  to experience Manchester City Hospitality by visiting the Eithad Stadium and the City Store for some merchandise.Met a Chinese couple and a gentleman from South Africa who were impressed as I was by the Stadium and the Legends what an amazing day!!
11,Visit to Etihad Stadium,"Great campus, with great selection of food wagons outside the stadium. Beer and chicken tikka pie £6.50 inside the stadium - well worth trying. Spotless toilets."
12,Match day,Wonderful experience to see City’s talented players. Great views from any seat in the ground. Staff are helpful and caring.
13,Great day as always in the Legends Lounge - staff were fantastic!,"The stadium is magnificent and well managed. Getting in and security extremely well done. They encourage you to use public transport well don’t. They close tram stations for 90 minutes after the game ends, build up huge queues and there is a tram maybe one every 20 minutes. How stupid. On top of this parking at or around the ground is difficult. Prepare to walk the distances De Brunner runs in the game - miles. Ruined a great experience."
14,Must do for a football lover,"With small amount we can visit stadium, £25 per person  Recommend make online reservation especially in holiday season. Don’t bring many things such as bags because there is control before entering the stadium. Just bring camera (smartphone) and enjoy the tour. Don’t forget to make video and photo with Pep Guardiola :)"
15, Cambusnethan Talbot 2010’s,"Surely with a venue used weekly the public travel to and from it should be seamless?  But of course not....40 minute (minimum) queues for a sardine can on rails (aka a tram) both ways.  There were additional buses on the way back, but the queue again was miles long.Then once at the venue cheerless security and unhelpful staff.Drinks were a rip off and decanted into plastic glasses (pint of wine anyone).  Taking in bottles was forbidden apparently, yet you could see many coke bottles and lager ones.  When you're expected to pay £25 for a cheap plastic bottle of wine you should at least be allowed the luxury of having it in the bottle and not as a 'drink me all now' option.This did put a dampener on an otherwise excellent night, but things like this would stop me from going again."
16,"Lovely stadium, clear view of the game","Fantastic, modern football ground with ample parking, great access, good food outlets and the greatest football ever played in the Premier League. So good I go every game!"
17,Emptyhad ,"Traveled to Manchester Piccadilly station and got the tram to the Etihad, staff at the train station was great to help direct us as we had never been before. Got to the stadium and went straight to the away end where there was a confusion to which gate to go in K or L, said K on the ticket but had to enter L. Finally got inside to a small bar with a poor choice of food but drinks was not overpriced. The steward was more than helpful to guide us to the seats which had plenty of room. The view from the away area was good but for some reason the ground did not impress me which I thought would after hearing thing about the Etihad. For some reason City fans do not fill this stadium and they sit watching the game like they are in a doctor’s surgery. A club like that should be sold out every home game along with drowning out the away fans with song. I can say now I’ve been to the Etihad Stadium but don’t think I will rush back. I think in truth City fans will agree with this review but will stay silent as it was at the game. I am a Aston Villa fan and this is not a review to be nasty in any way."
18,concert,Attended Metallica gig. Great venue for concerts (despite the rain) excellent access and very well organised would recommend if this is one of the venues an artist is playing at.
19,Tour with Ian and Marc,Thoroughly enjoyed the stadium tour led by Graham.  The access to all areas of the stadium was outstanding and Graham’s knowledge and interesting stories made it worth the trip from the U.S.
20,Excellent tour but lacks a bit of history and tradition,"A beautiful football ground, well catered for with great ambience and ready to help staff. A great experience overall! I will definitely recommend."
21,Superb venue,Always enjoy our trips to the Etihad. Easy access and helpful stewards. Needs some groundwork upgraded around the complex as lots of uneven surfaces and puddles in wet weather.
22,Football cray cray,"Visited here with teen and two 10 year olds. During our holiday we visited Old Trafford, Anfield and the Etihad, and as a United fan it pains me to say it, but the tour experience at the Etihad was definitely the best. The staff were amazing. Lucas and Georgia did the stadium with us, and the lovely Graham did the academy tour. Probably because we had the other tours to compare it to, we really appreciated the personal touches on this. Great not to be relying on ‘media devices’, but to hear stories from people who are entertaining and obvious fans themselves. Loved hearing about the past and present, and there are some really fun touches, like the interactive press room. Well worth the extra for the academy tour, and we even got to see Pep leaving after training. We are not converted, but have a new respect for City!"
23,Legends Lounge,Attend a match this week and found the stadium great. Easy access and parking was plentiful. Pleasant walk around the stadium and grounds with plenty of facilities to use prior to going in the stadium. Seating and views very good.
24,The only football team to come from Manchester,"GLORY GLORY Man City! The best stadium in the world, easy parking and food available on site but just don't get it at half time."
25,stadium tour,"Not too fond of the spiral climb to seating, some parts external are closed off by fence so quite a walk. Halal food options though."
26,amazing,A great atmosphere to watch the game.Get a good view of the match. Because the stadium is spacious it's possible to enjoy every minute of the match. Manchester City did not disappoint.
27,Football,"I visited on a weekday (4pm, £25 per adult). Tour starts Floor 1 of City Store. Pros:-90 minute tour. -My guide was Chris (supported by George). They are both humorous, informative and passionate about their Club. Also, good interaction with the visitors - whichever team they support. Multi-language media player also supplied for additional content. -Tour starts in trophy room (Floor 1 of City Store) then across to the Etihad Stadium for The Colin Bell Stand containing the The Tunnel Club, away & home changing rooms, media interviews zone, press room, players tunnel (walk out to a recording of crowd noise!), pitch-side view, dugout and (briefly) an elevated view from the Stand. Cons:-Not the cheapest tour."
28,Come on the blues,"great atmosphere, great ground, very entertaining and well organised with good transport links. activities before the game outside the ground in the fans village for children"
29,Manchester Derby,Home of the the greatest team in England. This is an amazing venue. A 15 minute walk from piccadilly train station. You can get the 216 bus from piccadilly.  Outside wetherspoons. Or jump the tram. On event days the tram gets packed. If your trying to get on at piccadilly train station you often can't get on the tram as it's so packed. I normally walk down to piccadilly gardens or st Peter's sq. You can now use your debit card touch and go for the tram. Meaning you dont have to que for a ticket. Just touch your card against the machine on the platform before boarding and then the same when u get off. Coming away from the stadium it's often quicker to walk into the city centre than que for tram or bus.
30,rude stewards,I love it here there is so much to do apart from watching football it's easily accessible and the grounds are amazing there is always something going on here
31,Manchester City v Fulham,"With tickets on special offer it was too good to resist and very pleased with the seats on the half way line.  Entry to the venue was simple and well sign posted with plenty of parking space.Stewards were very helpful and well trained.  Food was good as was the pre match entertainment.Very busy through the turnstiles and even with the security wanding, there was a steady flow of people through into the ground.Good view of the pitch and had a great time."
32,Stadium Tour ,"A must for any Man City fan or football fan in general, tour guide was very informative and humorous, you get to see parts of The stadium you only hear about, really enjoyed my visit"
33,City Stadium and Academy Tour,Easy place to get to and the staff were efficient and approachable. Every seat had a good view with pretty good legroom.
34,Brilliant experience ,"Beautiful grounds, well maintained and great view from our seats. Not too far from the city centre so Uber there was cheap too."
35,Not the best but was here for the Etihad experience,The new tour that lasts for one and half hours is really fascinating and a great in sight to Manchester City.
36,Great humerus adventure ,"We went to see the Spice Girls and traffic around the stadium was chaotic. Give yourself plenty of time if travelling by car. We witnessed a crash because of a drivers impatience, hitting another car hard enough to trigger air bags. Stadium itself is well equipped. Plenty of toilets inside, along with food outlets and bars. If seated, you are sheltered from the elements but those standing on pitch area got soaked in the rain. Egress inside the stadium well managed but roads were at a standstill. We waited 3/4 hour to move out of car park. I don’t know if charge is same for parking at every event, but this cost £15."
37,Fabulous venue for a conference ,"Just got back from the stadium.  Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and in good numbers.  Entry was quick and easy.  A nine seater golf-type buggy took us to our entry point as my g/daughter is suffering a knee injury.  Inside the stadium I found the staff equally professional, pleasant and helpful.  Seating was good (we were behind the goal post).  My criticism centres around the catering.  I ordered five portions of chips.  On receiving the first two they were cold.  Pointed this out to the server who politely took them back and returned them to the hotplate (where they were immediately picked up by the server of the next queue and given to the next customer!).  However, I did receive five portions of hot chips at a cost of 3 pounds per portion, (but cost only 1.50 when teamed up with an overpriced burger or hotdog.  There were no trays or boxes to carry them so had to do two trips.  Both the catering size tomato ketchup dispensers were empty and there was no mayonnaise or vinegar on offer.  Did not try the mustard sauce (who eats mustard sauce on chips!!!)."
38,Platinum Box ,"Go here on a regular basis, not just as a fan, but have used the lounges for dining, shopping in the club shop, all you meet here are great, and not forgetting some great concerts"
39,Away fans,"Incredible stadium. Very well staffed (professional attitude but also welcoming feeling)Very well designed. Serves drinks in reusable cups, which I feel all stadiums should have.This stadium is years ahead of other stadiums.They have an incredible souvenir shop and a village to create a great matchday atmosphere.The public transport is superb setup."
40,"Nice ground, quiet fans","A very good venue. Car park was busy so get their early. Large room overlooking the pitch, there is a large bar with lots of staff, didn't have to wait long to be served. The meal was very good."
41,Amazing day at a fantastic ground,Went there for a concert and It was all well organised and clean. Toilets were quite easy to reach. Overall it was really clean. Security was thorough and the stadium is huge
42,Stadium tour ,My first visit to this impressive stadium was to see the Spice Girls. The stadium has its own tram stop so is easily accessible. The stadium itself had a great atmosphere. It was raining but we were dry as the seating is all under cover. The seats themselves were padded which is really unusual for a football stadium. The bars were well staffed but very expensive at £5 per bottle but at least you didn’t have to wait. There are plenty of toilets so no queuing. Exiting after was also well managed. A great experience all round.
43,Amazing,"Not into football at all but have watched two concerts here, it is very easy to find and make your way around inside also makes for a great venue for music"
44,Where are the fans?,"Had to change pre-booked seats for a match and so contacted the ticket line and spoke to a very helpful gentleman called Ross. Ross was very easy to talk to and was very professional in his job, could not ask any more from him. Great customer service from this guy!"
45,Unforgettable experience,"A really beautiful stadium, well worth a visit. The heated seats in the stadium are very comfortable and worth the extra money, as is the VIP hospitality area where they do the best buttermilk chicken we have ever tried!"
46,Stadium tour,Would recommend this tour to anyone.  It was interesting to see behind the scenes of the stadium.   The Pep virtual visit in the press room is fantastic I have not seen anything so well worth seeing.  Our guides Graeme and Alison made the tour so interesting with their knowledge and interaction between themselves and the people on the tour.  I would definitely recommend this tour.
47,Man City v Port Vale FA Cup,Attended here for a Champions League game and found the place to be a fab stadium. From ordering the tickets and getting to our seats really straight forward. The view from the seats were spot on and from looking from inside the stadium it looked like the majority of seats had a good view. No hassle in leaving the stadium either. A good all round experience.
48,FA cup,We visited the tunnel club last night and although it is an amazing experience to see the players arrive and see them go down to the pitch through a one way mirror it was spoilt by the food. The champagne and wine are very generously served and the starters which were cold were fine but when we got to the main course the plates were hotter tan the food. To give them their dues they did replace both meals. My husbands was ok but mine was still lute warm. They wanted to replace mine again but as the match was about to start I ate some of my meal. It is an expensive treat spoilt by warm food.
49,What a stadium!!!!!!!!!,"The Etihad Stadium Tour was amazing and very informative. Shout out to Manchester City guides @Kassim and @kristina, made me love City with their warm and passionate hospitality... made me feel like am part of the city family....Wish one day I would get a chance to watch Manchester City live in action... I definitely recommend the visit/Tour 100% and will obviously visit whenever am back in Manchester...RegardsStephen (from Nairobi, Kenya)"
50,Lovely Stadium,"Easy to get to and concert very good. Felt safe, lots of security and staff to help with any problems. Limited choice of food available and everything was expensive.The main issue was the restricted view from our seats - South Stand, Block 213, seats 325 and 326. The view was blocked by a very tall speaker. We paid almost £90 each for the tickets and no warning that it was a restricted view. This was very disappointing and spoilt our enjoyment of the evening."
51,Cold and underwhelming,"Went to a City game and was very impressed by the Etihad compared to other stadiums. Great view from the seating even though high up, great bar area and entertainment/food outside but most impressive of all was the access in & out. You enter/leave via a spiral walkway that is easy wide enough for about 6 people at a time, so from the final wistle it took about 8 mins to empty the stadium!"
52,"The best stadium in Manchester, top 3 in UK","Daughter has said this was a great concert venue was very impressed , however the tram service struggled with the the crowds at the end of the show"
53,Chelsea game ,"Compared to other stadiums tours, the visit to Etihad stadiums is more intense and focused. It lasts 1h15 and brings you to majestic Manchester City's dressing room, round and completely different from any other dressing room. Then you visit the VIP stand and the players tunnel which is again much more majestic than in other stadiums. The pitch is fabulous.Then, the press rooms and other parts of the stadiums. Excellent."
54,Ethiad stadium tour,"I have been to every PL stadium and the Etihad match day experience is up there with the best. Whilst it doesn't have the heart and soul of Maine Road, the matchday offerings in, outside and around the stadium are second to none in the UK. CitySquare is always worth a pre-game visit."
55,The best team in the land and all the world,Amazing tour for kids with powerful messages and hard work and having the right atttitide. Amazing knowledge tour guides graham and Linda who were passionate about City and had a great sense of humour!!
56,But one issue...,"Great place and super interesting tour! Very friendly atmosphere, cool guides Linda and Chris (thank you guys!), easy to understand for everyone. Highly recommended! Thanks for the help in finding my backpack 👌"
57,Great guide! ,Everything from the stadium to the club shop has come along way in the last decade or so and anyone who does a stadium tour or visits for a football match would not be disappointed.
58,Love Manchester  city ,"Have visited the Etihad on several occasions now for both sporting and musical events. The stadium is big, clean and grand in its stature. Entry is well managed, as are the queues inside. Love the introduction of reusable beer cups inside the stadium too!"
59,Cameron for President,Visited the Etihad Stadium with family young children in October. Very nice stadium with lots of information about the city football club.
60,Cameron and Dave made this a great Tour ,"I was purchased a Stadium tour for my birthday, waht a treat, very informative guide, amazing ground, loved it, the following day I had the pklease of watching a match too."
61,"Amazing, amazing and amazing","This tour was amazing, the tour guides were patient and gave us plenty time to look around,Ray and Josh were brilliant with kids.The tour itself was incredible access to all areas."
62,Stadium Great Transport Links A Joke,"So well organised and staffed, was a really clean and beautiful stadium.Plenty of decent food and drink at okay prices for the football. Was surprised how good all viewing angles were even though I was very high up.Prices for tickets were fantastic also given the quality of the team."
63,Wow,"A great stadium, especially inside the VIP area, restaurant and lounge.Very comfortable seats and great ambience by the supporters."
64,The new theatre of dreams ,"Attended the Man City v Leicester. The corporate hospitality surely has to be the best of the best. Great environment, fabulous staff, excellent hospitality, amazing food and entertainment second to none. What else can you want"
65,A must for Football (soccer) fans,I visited this place not for a football match but to see a gig.  It was well organised and great visibility even though we were a distance from the stage.  Drinks were very expensive which I didn't like as you couldn't take your own in and I thought that unfair.
66,No Atmosphere,"First ever visit. I visited this stadium with my son and grandson as away supporters of Leicester City.  The stadium looks great from the outside and I was pleasantly surprised to find the inside was just as good.  I expected an athletics stadium feel but no, it was a great football atmosphere.  The seats were good and the view was magnificent.  Well done City!."
67,Spice Girls concert,Chance to see inside heart of a Major football club. Perfectly aided with last technologies during the presentation and tour. To highlight the picture with Guardiola in the Press Room whcih will be the perfect memory!
68,Spice girls,"Great Tour led by Graham and young Ray, lots to see and very informative couldn’t recommend this highly enough. 2 hours well spent and what a place!"
69,"Brill atmosphere, champions home","Went on the tour , fab experience . Interesting information and great photo opportunities. Amazing to sit where the players sit in the dressing room."
70,Home of the Champions,Entry to the concert was swiftly managed with bag and security checks for everyone.While it was raining on the day we had seats in block 106 which were undercover and provided a good view of the stage.Facilities including toilets and bars for food and drink were plentiful with low queues(although nowhere seemed to stock any sweets or chocolates - only crisps!). After the concert was a bit chaotic exiting the stadium and knowing which direction we needed to be in but I suppose this is to be expected for a large venue.A good venue for a concert although if standing there is no protection from the elements.
71,Champions League,We did the Stadium tour while on a weekend trip to Manchester. The tour is great value for money it last's almost 2 hours and well worth the money. Our tour guide (cant remember her name but she told us she lives in Halifax) was great really friendly and great at her job. you also get 10% off in the City Store after the tour so a tip is do not buy beforehand.
72,Etihad Stadium tour of Manchester City ,"World class stadium, world class team, affordable food and drinks with great hospitality packages on offer"
73,Fantastic,The tour it's absolutely incredible. It lasts 2 hours and you can learn everything about the club and the stadium. Mr. Graham is the best tour guide you can find. He's very friendly and he knows every single thing about the club and it's history. He is responsible of this great tour that I had. The Etihad Stadium tour it's something you have to do if you visit Manchester.
74,Impressive stadium and easy to get to ,"Visited here recently to see the Spice Girls. The show was brilliant. Getting into the Stadium took a time but it is understandable nowadays. Security is paramount. As is generally the case, the ladies toilets were always busy and queuing estential. To be fair they did have lots of Portaloos as well. The Spice Girls gave a really good show, with fireworks too. At the end of the show it was very easy to exit the Stadium with lots of staff directing you. No problems. There was somebody who needed medical attention and the staff were able to locate the person by holding their high-vis jacket up in the air on a stick, thereby making the place to be sought easy to be foind. Things were quickly dealt with. I had a brilliant time"
75,World Class,Excellent tour with guides Lucas and Steve.Very knowledgable and always ready with any questions the group asked.The etihad is a superb stadium and smells of money but does lack a bit of history or tradition which most stadiums have
76,Awesome facility,"A fantastic and very memorable day out. So good I might do it twice.The tour guide who took us around was great, did nt rush us around and was very knowledgeable."
77,World class.,"Is very family friendly and has a great day out for business packages, food was excellent and service was as well"
78,Where is everyone?,Visiting the Etihad for the first time is pretty special. Start the day with the tour so you can sit in 'Pep's seat' and see where they do the TV interviews and get near to the hallowed turf. Our tour guides were fantastic - Linda was a diehard City fan and was terrific.Ray was an old funny Mancunian. It set the game up magically. City have thought about an overall family experience and they have music and interviews before and after the game to entertain the crowds. High drama as the coach with the players arrive and are taken through the 'tunnel club.'I had waited a long time to see City play at home and it was a perfect weekend. I absolutely love the set up at Manchester City after many decades a club to be genuinely proud of.
79,Manchester City Stadium,Great day out for a group of adults teenagers and young children. The tour was informative and fun. Would recommend.
80,Manchester City vs Chelsea,"Attended a concert here and although it’s pretty well organised, I feel it’s just too big for music events. There feels like there is no atmosphere at all. The stairs are very steep on the higher tiers and are rather dangerous."
81,Another Dream come through!!,"If I attend a football match at the Etihad and stand up I will be asked to sit down and then risk being ejected if I do not comply. Why the is it acceptable to stand up and obstruct other customers view at a concert. Last night yet again I had to watch 2 mature men nearly coming to blows due to one of the wives having no consideration while the steward turned blind one. Surely if you want to dance then there is plenty of room on the pitch. Do these selfish individuals not think that some punters have chosen a seat on issues such as injury,age,medical condition.I must stress this did not directly involve myself but I am seeing such incidents at converts on a regular basis. Come on Etihad and other such venues sort your policy out so we can avoid such hassle at an otherwise excellent venue.Top venue,excellent facilities."
82,Visit to Etihad Stadium. ,"Set in the heart of the countryside in a valley we found this giant stadium where Tennis was being played on all 24 courts. Its a Mecca for enthusiasts although at times apparently they use the stadium for football but that is no worry as football is a very minority sport in this city. Usual gates at the ""Etihad"" are about 250 people for their 4th division games.The facilities are awesome and with free entry what's not to like.Yes its even rumoured that they might move ""Wimbledon"" to the ""Etihad"" stadium as parking is so bad in London, what a boost that would be for Manchester, bring it on as this is the city of Tennis."
83,Not much History,"Attended Muse concert Saturday night, been to many a football ground to see bands and have to say I was impressed on how well this was organised, right down to the exits they had created removing banks of seats in the process to allow easy access and egress.Will we return - yes if the right bands are there."
84,Concert ,"Great family day out visiting world class team. Always have a great experience when visiting for games and also recently thoroughly enjoyed the stadium tour, well recommended."
85,Good but rushed in places...,Amazing stadium and the most important thing it’s the comfortable seats!! You can enjoy the football match
86,Great Tour!!,Visited the complex for a man v fat tournament and the facilities were not to bad and the food was ok
87,Amazing staff and venue,If you want a good atmosphere go to anfield they buy flags to hide the empty seats and they use arabic money
88,Hot Hospitality,If you sit near the front and it rains you will get wet.Beer and food prices are average for a stadium. Staff helpful.
89,A Must See Attraction,"Booked this tour for my partners birthday, from start to finish amazing, staff at the stadium were friendly and helpful, our tour guides were excellent and knowledgable, they interacted with all of us and were happy to answer any questions, (Graham and David I think we’re the names) the tour itself is so well organised and gives access to so many places, there were people on the tour who were not Manchester City fans (myself included) but that did not spoil the experience, we both enjoyed every minute of the tour and would highly recommend to anyone"
90,Atmosphere is trash,"This was my first experience of a concert at a stadium.The etihad was easy to drive too, there was plenty of parking close to the ground and not overly expensive.We got food inside the ground, this is always overpriced but adequate.Our seats were high up, practically in the Gods! The sound quality was not loud enough for the first few songs, but improved somewhat towards the end. The stage set up and screens was the biggest I’ve seen!I think I still prefer arenas and more intimate venues than these large football stadiums for concerts."
91,Man City v Aston Villa,Brilliant tour and brilliant games equal an amazing place with Manchester city vibes. The blues have turned this into possibly the best stadium in the world.🏟🏟🏟🔥🔥
92,Stadium Tour,The venue at the Etihad Stadium is impressive and the top of the Premier League offers  great football. This place is definetely woth a visit if you like football. The stadium is easily accessed by the Metrolink tram (Etihad Campus Station) and I was impressed with how fast people were able to board the Metrolink after the game.
93,Absolutely brilliant. A must for any City fan,"Did stadium tour at 11am on 14th June.  Graham and Ray were excellent,  very engaging even for a non football fan...although my husband is into football. Lady who we spoke to before tour who took our photo was also very polite and helpful!"
94,Football match,"Been to a few home matches at different times and always loved the atmosphere. everyones pleasant and very good, tight security."
95,Great experience shame about the main course,Grand Football Stadium made with great detailing to provide equal space to away and home team. Press Conference with Coach is ultimate moment. Must visit.
96,Great stadium tour,Very fun tour. Great shop. You get to go see the players locker room which is really fun and they take you down to the field. Awesome place especially if you're a fan!
97,An impressive feat of architecture,Visited the stadium for Man City v West Ham fixture in February and attended the tunnel club.  I'm not a fan of either club but the experience was excellent in the opulent surroundings of the tunnel club.  it is a great new approach to matchday hospitality and I would highly recommend to anyone
98,Manchester City v Aston Villa,Went to see Muse.  Well organised in terms of accessing the staduim and on leaving.  On leaving there was a long line for the metro tram back into the city but it was well organised.
99,Machester City vs Aston Villa,Great Stadium to go with the best team.  Good view from seats all round stadium. Very good stadium tour. Places to eat too.
100,Great customer service from Ross.,Football played in England like brazil by the champions of England .wonderfull stadium.fine choice food and drink
101,Great venue,"Did the guided tour of the stadium. We booked it through booking.com at a good discount. The tour begins in a small museum room in the Man City Store and then moves to the stadium itself. The tour includes the players entrance, the gym rooms, the Home and Visitors dressing rooms, the tunnel and the team dug outs at the side of the pitch. Our guides were Alison and Sam and they were very informative and good fun throughout. The tour finished in the press room where you have your virtual photo taken with The Man City manager."
102,Phenomenal,"Was here for my first live uk football experience and certainly was not impressed when the home fans was already leaving way before the game was finished, crowd was only cheering to score and feels that it was not fully behind the home team and that imho was probably lacking in the overall Etihad experience as it was dead quiet in most parts of the game especially when the away team scored first, but thanks for the experience!"
103,CAHN GALA EVENT ,Great place great atmosphere love it.  Left 6 mins before the end as to miss traffic.Just would not eat inside stadium as prices are very expensive.
104,Terrible if your not a Man City fan,A spectacularly impressive stadium which demonstrates its adaptability by hosting a massive rock concert of 60000 attendees an Metallica the band their crew and stage. The organisation and security at the event were faultless. There are ample facilities for a crowd of this size. Manchester’s weather didn’t disappoint but the rain never threatened to dampen our spirits. Acoustically this is one of the best stadium concerts I’ve been to. It can certainly accommodate the biggest of stage sets and due to its proximity to the city centre and transport links to teams buses trains and planes it is a perfect place to go see the best bands on offer never mind football.
105,Birthday treat,"World class experience.  State of the art.  Try the stadium tour, very good insight , great for family’s."
106,Excellent tour,Our 5 and 8 year old's really enjoyed the stadium tour today - and one is a Barcelona fan :-)!!! Julie the tour guide was fabulous.
107,Definitely tell this was once a commonwealth stadium,Great stadium! Muse was great.Awful undignified treatment of people on exit towards the metrolink. It was like a shepherd herding sheep - awful!
108,Football ,"My husband and son had a great tour. The facilities were superb, only to be expected really I suppose.The tour guide was entertaining and informative. A real value for money trip"
109,George & Fran Tour Guides of Quality,Want to see the only team from Manchester play? The Etihad is the place to be. Forget them lot from the borough of Trafford unless you’re looking for a comedy show.
110,Impressive venue,"I work as a tour guide in the UK and I brought a French group (39 people) to the Etihad a few days ago. Martin was our tour guide working in tandem with Dominic. First we watched a video with French commentaries (I believe they can offer up to 10 different languages to the visitors) then we did the tour of the stadium and finished in the shop. The tour lasted more than an hour and Martin and Dominic accommodated to our itinerary timings (my group was catching their flight back to France after the visit).Martin was full of little stories and you could feel his passion for football. He was an amazing entertainer, could answer the many questions asked that morning and made an effort speaking a bit of French to my group. I do not really follow football and the tour made me want to learn more about this sport.As a tour guide, I had the translate the tour to my group and it was great to work with Martin who understood how to work with non English speaking group.I would recommend the tour to both individuals and big groups. Merci Martin et Dominic. I hope to see you guys soon."
111,great modern stadium,"We chose the Mancunian Bar hospitality option. Wonderful food, lovely atmosphere, great seats.Thanks to Eddy for his fantastic recommendation. A wonderful treat for my father-pity about the result.My only grumble is that for the price you pay the complimentary parking is too far away."
112,Watching City,Thanks to the Trip Advisor Crew we had the BEST night at the Spice Girls Concert in Manchester 2019 ;) SO KIND and SO HELPFUL we are really GRATEFUL for them!!! THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH for giving us the BEST night!!!
113,Great tour and tour guiding,"best tour of a stadium i done,tour guide was family friendly and earnt many things we did not know.Shop was great amazing selection of items we never seen before x"
114,Premier in every way,"Somebody bought me a guest pass to the stadium tour for my birthday.   I was expecting sweaty changing rooms and draughty stands,  but instead got the 5-Star treatment on a small group tour with a very knowledgable guide.You don’t have to be a super fan to enjoy this visit!  If you are a City fan though,  you'll love it!"
115,"Spectacular stadium, poor food","I went to see City v Dinamo Zagreb in this modern stadium.I travelled to the game on the tram which has its own stop at the etihad.The first thing you see is the shop;an Aladdins cave for young fans but really sixty quid for a shirt,you must be joking.The Outdoor bar and refreshments are a bit tacky but I guess regular City fans like them.All part of the matchday experience;lets see how much money we can get off you.Prior to getting in its an airport style frisking job ,of which I heartily approve.No spending the time ducking missiles when the fans get tribal these days.Once inside there is a corridor runs round the stadium with staircases going up into your section.The layout is pretty good and if you want to make a pig of yourself or have a bet you can do.On this night the programmes were in short supply as I didn't find any.The toilets have come on a bit since the old Maine Road.Anyone remembering the single 60watt light bulb lighting the very basic Gents at the end of A block will breathe a sigh of relief- well just to be able to breathe.If I was a swish rich kid , I could have a good meal before the game or even better if I was a lottery winner I could watch the game from the balcony of a private box but I don't think I would choose to.The views are pretty good,until some idiot decides to stand up and stay up.Stewarding of this is hopeless,probably because they pay a part time girl or old git like me a minimum wage so they don't really bother.I felt safe throughout the game and afterwards.Is this because they do so well at segregating fans these days.? The attitude of Football fans remains as tribal as ever though.How come we get a blind ref every week.? etc.They also mostly know how to score a goal and there are 40,000 master tacticians who should be earning a good living managing a team of millionaires !"
116,The best,Great tour considering Steve and Qasim todayThey make it worthwhile. I strongly recommend as great sightseeing (regardless of sports).
117,Great stadium lacking in atmosphere,"Came here for a stadium and academy tour for my 9 years olds birthday treat he’s a massive City fan From start to finish we was amazed at the knowledge of the guides Helen and Cameron The tour was absolutely amazing the stadium is stunning and the access inside the stadium was brilliant access to both dressing rooms,walk out the tunnel and sitting in peps seat!!We then took a buggy over to the academy where we was shown where the youth and city women train our driver/guide Ian was very knowledgable and answered every question we hadDefinitely worth the money in my eyes we started the tour at 11.30 and eventually came out of the city store (after son spent his money ten times over 🤣) at 3.30 Would most certainly recommend to people of  all ages although there is a lot of steps."
118,City vs Dinamo Zagreb,"What a fantastic tour , made extremely special by the tour guides Martin, Julie and Mike they were a mind of information and made everyone feel special."
119,Tunnel Club is excellent,"Only good thing was the cheese and onion pie. Facilities poor, limited food choice around the stadium (nothing at all near visitors end). Crap beer inside and bar closed after half-time. Also atmosphere during game was cemetery like."
120,Best stadium,"What can I say simply the best stadium for the best football team in the world, I can say this is my second home, Cmon City."
121,Best Tennis courts in Manchester,"At last I was able to visit the club I had followed since I was ten. Back then Maine Road was our ground, which we also saw the remnants of the next day, by the way, but now time had come to enjoy the amazing Etihad as well as the club's Football Academy. First out was Graham to guide us through the inside of the Etihad rooms and ground. He took us through to the pitch, which this actual day still was covered with plates after the Spice Girls' concert the evening before. Passing though numerous rooms, among others the post match press room, we were allowed to sit in Pep's chair and have him virtually interacting with us. This left us all very impressed indeed. Graham was more than willing to answer our questions, also mine about the old times. Afterwards we were taken on a buggy ride with Ian to the Football Academy. He too is a most polite, professional, forthcoming and humourous guide. We had a very interesting tour, led by genuinely giving and kind employees. You can be very proud of them, City! Cheers from three amazed and impressed guests from Norway."
122,More than a club ,Best service and best team in the world it was incredible the stewards bar staff programme sellers and the overall facilities are the best out there
123,C'mon City,"Stadium gigs can be a bit of a lottery, distance from the band, poor sound quality poor facilities are often the complaints. However the Ethiad is really well organised and for a stadium of this size it feels really intimate and the sound was really good. The car parking is close and easy - cash only. There are many parking lots on the way to the stadium but frankly for proximity to the stadium and space and security the Stadium is a great option. The stewards also give the impression they are there to make sure you have a good time. Highly recommended."
124,Brilliant,Came here thinking it was the stadium for Man United but turns out it was for Man City. How embarrassing. Lads were great though treated me like a Man City fan.
125,10/10,Thanks to all the city fans that we spoke to had a great day watching port vale there in FA cup fantastic stadium and fans
126,The Manchester City Stadium Tour,"The Etihad Stadium is a great ground to watch a match, much better than the cramped Old Trafford. One criticism, they have to sort out the wifi inside the ground which is shocking!!"
127,Loved it!,"Excellent tour we really enjoyed it specially my husband . The tour guides are awesome and kind ( josh , Martin and Paul )"
128,Reminiscing at the City Of Manchester Stadium,"Been going here since it opened, I've been to several different events including football, boxing and also music concerts.Very well sign posted and easy access, not a bad seat in the house really!"
129,Etihad tour 14 September 2019 @ 10am,What for a great tour with Ian and Marc which are give us the chance to share their Manchester City world. Actually we are not such great soccer fans but after this tour i can feel the football passion. We had a wonderful time with the other visitors. Eva and Ron
130,Great Tour,My friend and I have attended many concerts at the Ethiad and found events well organised and great outside venues!
131,Great Visit,"Watched a Premier League match between City & Chelsea. Beer was cheaper than expected and the food was passable. There was some of the home fans hurling abuse towards the away section and when Chelsea scored a few of them went over to cause some aggravation.Much to my surprise and joy they were almost immediately ejected and the police were onsite within minutes. Impressive handling.I would most certainly repeat, but maybe in the Summer when it's a bit warmer!"
132,Away match at the Etihad,You’ve got to visit the home of the Champions. So much more than just a walk around. My other half is red & she had to admit she was blown away.
133,Great Tour BEST TEAM,"A very nice ground to go to, but it lacks atmosphere.... I prefer lower division clubs. But the welcome and hospitality is great."
134,Home from Home,In the tunnel club had a great day would recommend for a small scale work conference we had a great day lovely food as the day went on and lovely tea breaks
135,A Result at the Etihad ,"Absolutely perfect in every way -  but one issue. After 3 hour car journey with children , all needed toilet on arrival . What toilets ? Other than one near the blue moon cafe which was absolutely disgusting ( gents unusable) , ended up going to Mc Donald’s to use theirs.Cannot believe a club that genuinely tries to make the match day experience perfect overlooks this issue?"
136,Ladies City v Man U match,"Been on games, tour, conferences and it's always been brilliant. Always clean and well organised. Cmon city!"
137,Amazing family experience ,"Wanted to see some of the football culture of a city so rich with it.  The Etihad Stadium is a nice sight to see while in Manchester.  Easy to get tickets for a tour.  The tour group was a nice, not overcrowded, size.  Our tour guide was amazing (think his name was Ray).  They take you into the stadium, beside the pitch, in the locker rooms, and into the premium members club.  Incredible to think that some of the best soccer players in the world have walked the same halls."
138,City V BHA,We attended the Spice Girls tour. The stadium staff were professional at all times. It was easy to get in. Time was spent queuing to get through the turnstiles but that was understandable. I felt safe as everyone was bag searched and metal checked going in. I would choose this venue again to attend for other music events.
139,Very well organised ,"Excellent stadium tour last Sunday, our guide Mike was very informative & witty - he’s a great asset as he’s very knowledgeable about all aspects of City - we really enjoyed it- yes we were disappointed the match we booked for on the Saturday was rescheduled but hey they won & that’s all that matters - hope to visit again start of next season"
140,Excellent stadium ,"Having seen highlights of games here on the TV it was good to finally see a game live. This is a big, modern and impressive stadium. Good view of the game and loads of toilets and places to buy food and drink. It was also easy to get to as I took a tram from the city centre which stops yards away from the ground. A great stadium."
141,Fantastic Tour,Technology is excellent at the stadium ..nice feeling to be there .. players change room home side is great even a gym is available ..although not a City supporter
142,Concert,The concert itself was incredible.no complaints on the stadium or staff within the stadium itself. Complaints were when the event had finished and the organisation of the outside regarding taxis. We have children with us and every uber we booked was jumped in by someone else. Staff were pointing us in each and every direction with no clear point for us to safely get a taxi. We may have walked 2 miles up and down being sent around in a wild goose chase. Not from around the area so not really any clue where we were going. Spoke to alot or families and groups in the exact same postion as us. All wondering which way to go and where to go just to safely get back to our hotel. The lack of organisation outside really let it down because everything else was really good.
143,Fantastic Family Day ,What a brilliant day out. Fabulous tour with enthusiastic guide. Loved it. Great heated seats for Pep and the crew.
144,Great family day out visiting world class team,This is an amazing venue I’ve been a few times to see Stone Roses and years ago U 2 . The only downfall is getting in. You had to que for ages to get in and it was very disorganised outside. Spice girl concert every one was stood in the rain getting soaked just waiting so it is a massive area for improvement. Other people I know have said it’s been bad for take that converts also so if you are visiting be prepared! Once inside it’s brilliant and as I said good venue staff there very helpful once you get in.
145,Great Stadium!,"Great venue, staff were friendly and efficient, felt safe here. They responded quickly to any incidents before and during the concert. The paramedics were also amazing. Food was tasty, not too many queues for food and drink. Toilets clean and no queues either. It is open air so be prepared if the weather isn’t great. I was cold but it gave me a good excuse to buy expensive MUSE merchandise."
146,Stadium & Academy Tour,In the higher bracket of fine dining but superb quality.  A very pleasant experience.  We also had our work christmas do here which we thoroughly enjoyed.
147,MCFC Stadium Tour,"Fantastic tour delivered by Kaseem. Very knowledgable, full of facts with humour included. Came for sons 10th birthday. Was meant to be Cardiff City game but due to fixture changes we did tour instead. Not disappointed- an amazing venue and facility."
148,Great staff,I am in a wheelchair and all the staff at the ground were so helpfull in getting me to and from would love to go back
149,Etihad Stadium Tour ,"Visited the Ethiad today, a birthday treat for our 14 & 7 year old sons . Absolutely well worth a visit. We did the stadium and academy tour and was worth every penny.Made our sons day sitting in the home dressing room and walking through the tunnel to the pitch side. Lucas and Martin the tour guides were excellent, so friendly and full of interesting knowledge about the club, so a big thank you to them for making our experience a fab one. Spent an absolute fortune in the city shop but again worth every penny to see the smiles on the boys faces . Will definitely visit again 5 *."
150,Great modern stadium with great views from all angles,"We visited The Etihad on Saturday morning (26th Oct) and were shown around by Helen & Keith who were very warm, welcoming and knowledgable. It was a very wet morning but even the rain couldn’t dampen our enthusiasm. We saw 2 short films about the club which were very interesting and we got to sit in the heated seats that belong to the Tunnel Club members  - a big bonus on such a damp day! At pitch level it looks much smaller than it is on TV and there was a great buzz around the ground ahead of the early kick off that day. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour despite not being able to enter the dressing rooms ( due to 12.30 k.o) and Keith & Helen were brilliant guides. Highly recommend."
151,Excellent Tour,We went to Manchester city for the stadium tour got to say it was fantastic the place is amazing.our tour guide was called Cameron and he was super friendly and very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the club told us lots of great facts and stories about the club and answered any question anyone had. We were allowed to take unlimited photos too to remember our day at man city. Would highly recommend this tour to anyone who is a football enthusiast.
152,Mandatory if loving football,"Amazing tour by BrandonGreat stadium amazing pitchClub, Locker rooms, videos, trainning ground are amazing"
153,Fantastic!,"My 11 year old has decided City are his team, so, off we went to see the Port Vale cup tie. I’ve been to a lot of the 92 stadiums and this is probably the best. Pre match outside the stadium for kids was superb with plenty to do. We will definitely return maybe for the tour."
154,City the best team👍👍👍,"Travelled a long way for this game and payed a lot of money for my ticket in “Corporate hospitality” ..... was told I had to move seats along with my friends as I was sat in a neutral fan area, ok we said no problem as we were being spat at from City fans above, only to be sent out to the concourse and ejected from the stadium by terrible attitude stewards and the police ..... lovely stadium but half empty ..... sort your “ hospitality” outTerrible"
155,From Russia with love,We booked here not realising it would coincide with city winning the league. Our booked tour was moved which was really disappointing asIt meant we couldn’t do another planned activity but we accepted the change and wereGiven complimentary tickets to the event at the stadium to watch the match on the big screens etc. The tour was fine - it wasn’t the most interesting or engaging despite the best effort of the guide. The shop was shut for ages which meant loads of standing round waiting and we did the academy tour too which was informative. We eventually made it intoThe live screening but left very quickly. We aren’t city fans and didn’t want to stay watchingThe match. I’ve done other stadium tours that were more engaging. The tech used in this is impressive tho so I’m sure some will love it
156,A world class stadium with excellent guides,"Great concert venue,meverythingbwas very organized.  Lots of bathrooms, good security and enough snack bars throughout the stadium.  (Saw the Spice Girls - they are still amazing and still have their Girl Power!"
157,Fantastic tour and guide ,"Visited hoping to see many legends and silverware. Unfortunately all the players were on holiday and the trophy cabinet shut. Not all was bad however, as i did get to meet Lee Won Pen a semi legendary figure who kindly pointed out the cost of success that  mr Sour Man Sheek had religously contributed to. Overall 20 times."
158,Nice tour for a small-ish club,"amazing venue attend multiple concertsed sheren Spice Girls Jess Glynneall well catered for, prices are as expected at any gig spacious and well represented by all"
159,Must see it,We went ro see the stadium ghat our kids love.Great staff and a nice experience.We will definitely come back for a game in the next trip.
160,Excellent tour ,Was there for last nights Manchester Metallica gig. Superb place. Superb atmosphere. Will be back again soon!!!!!!
161,Carol H,"Attended the spice girls concert last night. Really enjoyed the show but the abusive smokers near us in the standing section out a dampener on it slightly. Of course being in the crowd, there was no way for us to get bring this behaviour to a stewards attention so just had to put up with it. I really think the stadium should ban cigarettes even being carried in to the stadium as it was unpleasant having to breathe in other people’s mucky cancer air."
162,Great Experience,"Went to see Muse last night and have to say the venue was very well run, organised and no fuss getting in and away at the end of the gig."
163,Amazing,This was a brilliant tour we had our 9 month old with us and a buggy you need to ask for Mike and Ray to give you the tour they were perfect!!!! Mike was very good at explaining everything and as being 7 months pregnant also making sure I was always ok. Ray was wow there’s no words to explain how amazing he was he carried out buggy down and up stairs as my husband was holding the baby! I mean never have I had such an excellent tour experience EVER! You need to check it out!!! Defo will be going again and hoping Mike and Ray do the tour again xx
164,Exciting Tour,"As something of a veteran football fan, I have attended Everton matches at Maine Road many times, and loved it. Not only for matches against City, but also various cup semi-finals we've been involved in. It was always a favourite 'away'.  A traditional old stadium, steeped in history. Always a fantastic atmosphere. This, on the other hand, left me cold. A soulless lump of concrete and metal. Maybe i'm just getting old. I found myself longing for a fat woman to produce a bell. Mind you, most modern day football fans wouldn't even understand that reference, so maybe its just me. In addition to this, we left to get a pint 10 minutes before half time, and by the time we got served it was 5 minutes into the second half. 30 minutes? I thought new stadia would put an end to this kind of thing? About 5 staff to serve several thousand thirsty Evertonians? ""Standing on the Kippax streeeeeeet, to see Joe Mercers aces!"""
165,Amazing tour,Lovely modern stadium but full of empty seats on match days. Many new foreign faces that were never seen on match days at Maine Road. If you’re looking for traditional English football I recommend the bus/taxi fare to Boundary Park a few miles up the road in Oldham.
166,Stadium Tour,"If you’re considering whether or not to go - do! It’s a great show. Spectacular set, staging, choreography & fireworks. The girls looked like they were genuinely loving being up there. No apparent sound issues at this venue. Only Sporty can sing but we all knew that. And they were always about much more then the vocals. It was Mel B’s birthday & exactly 21 years since Jerry left, which added an extra little frisson to this particular show. It poured down throughout the night - but the girls soldiered on.Great entertainment - get there if you can."
167,fantastic experience to add to the experience of our favourite place anyway.,"I visit a lot of stadium allround Europe and this stadium is number one. Huge Fan shop, huge fan zone. Simply to find your seat and the best organisation."
168,Amazing,"I've never been to the Etihad before and i usually see gigs at the MEN, however when Muse was coming to town I wasn't going to miss out. The Etihad may be known for being the home of Manchester City but what a great gig venue! I loved the zone out front with the ( very expensive but typical venue priced) food and drinks, and staff were very friendly if you needed help finding anything. Beginning the stadium was fine. I half expected them to do security checks in the fan zone area though rather than not u til you get inside. It was unclear where to go once you got in...we just had to keep asking stewards, who again were very friendly. The sound was great and it's obvious all the hard work that goes into getting the place ready and taking it all down after everyone goes. They did a lot to ensure it wasn't pure chaos at the trams too, making sure it was orderly. It's a great place for a concert and I'd be happy to come here again for another great concert!"
169,Stadium Tour,"Wife and our older son being Cityzens visted the Etihad stadium. Two guides that took us on a stadium tour, shared a lot of interesting facts about the life on the stadium, players, games... The fact that most of the pitch was covered with protective cover (due to recent Metallica and SpiceGirls concerts) didn’t diminish the grandeur of the stadium. Shop was being renovated, so you could only choose from a couple of jerseys from two containers in the back of the shop. Maybe they should add a little souvenir, like badge or a diploma to have as a memory of your visit. Little trick with the Guardiola hologram in the press conference room is a winner."
170,Amazing experience,Love city  amazing  place cafe drinks  screens and football  fans   nice vip box office   loving  and staff  friendly  and  helpful  find right steats for you
171,Stadium Tour,"We had tickets to the Man City vs Crystal Palace match (shame about the 2-2 result!) and had hospitality in the legends lounge. Fantastic food, drinks and overall experience. Seats/view was quality and would most definitely recommend the upgrade compared to normal match day tickets."
172,BEST STADIUM EVER,"I am not a football fan but when I visited Manchester with my wife, this was one place that I had to visit. Have heard so much about it from my football loving friends. Have heard so much about the team and city. We reached the stadium at around 3pm and booked the Stadium Tour for 4pm. It cost £27 per adult. The tour is an hour and a half long and takes you through the various parts of the stadium. Beginning with a small video with the history of the city and team and ending with a look inside the stadium. Our tour guides Ray and Roger took us through each and every story while we passed through the player entrance, green rooms, spa, gym, strategy room, lounge, stadium and the press room. We even met with the coach of ManU at the press conference ;PThe tour is overall a good experience. Had I been a football fan I would have loved it even more. To relive the memories. Walk the the corridors. See the stadium. A thumbs up to Ray and Roger for their warmth and humour. They were amazing hosts and made us feel really special. They did everything to make sure each of 12 people on the tour is comfortable and looked after. If they could include a momento and bottle of water in the package, it would make the tour even more exciting. I think they cam manage that much in £27."
173,Not bad ,I have done a stadium tour a fewof years ago but this new one is much better organised and you see much more thanks to our guides Dave and Allison very knowledgeable friendly and professional.
174,Surprisingly good!,Went during a match so that I knew there would be plenty of room. The seats really are blue. It's not fans dressing up. Little atmosphere in the place. Might try it when it's not a matchday !
175,A fantastic day out,"I’m a Manchester City season ticket holder so I’m going to be biased, but my opinion is that this is the best stadium for fans in the country as the seats are spacious and there’s plenty to do around the stadium, concourse and then obviously the football on the pitch isn’t bad either!"
176,Boys birthday ,"I’m a Man United fan and I did this tour because my 9 year old (Liverpool fan son) asked me to. He likes visiting different stadia.  Cameron and Dave were the tour guides and they were so efficient and knowledgeable about the history of the club and it’s impact on Manchester it made me have a bit of a liking for man city.   The tour itself was brilliant and I have to say better than the old trafford tour and anfield tour, from a modern perspective.  I would recommend this tour to anyone interested in football."
177,Great stadium,"Brought our 13 year old son, to see Metallica, we had the best time, the staff on the day were brilliant friendly and helpful, one of the staff on the merchandise stalls was very miserable and rude to all the fans wanting tshirt, but I don't think that would be your responsibility, the food and drink trucks staff were friendly, and helpful, the young lad who let us in and scanned us, he was really chatty and friendly, the gig was amazing the support bands especially ghost were fantastic, and Metallica were the best really enjoyed it we had great seats great view of the stage, the seats were comfy looking forward to coming again"
178,Metallica Concert,"Really liked this Stadium - easy in easy out. Wasn't the most exciting match, but hey ho.! Facilities were great and well organised"
179,Muse!!,Our daughter paid for the tour for our birthdays the best present ever.our tour guide was Cameron a lovely young man who was friendly and knowledgeable.A must for any city fan.
180,Spice Girls Concert,What a fantastic tour. We are City fans and it was just brilliant to get to see the tunnel the changing rooms etc. Loved it. Alison and Dominic wee great tour guides lots of fun. Thank you for a brilliant time.
181,Spice Girls,Had a fantastic day out with top end hospitality in box 28 at the Etihad stadium - arrived early and enjoyed the food and drinks and perfect vantage point for the game - we were neutrals but my son is huge fan of much of the squad. This was such a memorable way to visit Man City and worked out so well for us !
182,Etihad Stadium Tour,Great experience; the passione of the tour leaders (Keith and Martin) makes very nice experience despite the “limit” winning tradition of the club (if compared with the cousins). Nice idea the press conference with....Pep Guardiola. The intercation with the guides is a plus. Good job!!!
183,Sightseeing after the work day,"Visited to watch my husband’s team Crystal Palace V City. As away fans there was a few things that impressed me. The food selection was very limited - just pies - but the pies were really nice. Hubby had the steak pie and I had cheese and potato- both really nice, tasty and good quality and reasonably priced. The other thing that pleased me was the reusable plastic drinking receptacles- a holder to place them in when finished so they could be reused - excellent!!! More football stadiums should be doing this. Will definitely go back."
184,City ,As huge City fans it is an especially amazing experience! So many new features since our last tour (2 years ago)- which have added to the experience. Graham and Cameron were excellent guides. Thank you
185,"Man City, not United?","What a difference a week makes, went to Ricoh stadium last week for Spice Girls , it was hell, dangerous and scary (and that wasn’t the band! ) But Ethiad Stadium and all there should be proud of themselves, felt safe. Muse on Saturday and was a bit worried but amazing organisation, stewards were fantastic and plentiful. Great and full security checks . No crushes.  Will go back here to see bands even if it is way out of our area. Lovely greeting from all the staff and there were a couple of incidents in the standing area and stewards and full first aid where there in seconds sorting and keeping people away. Thank you to all x Oh and Muse were amazing too!"
186,Wow ,"Did your today after watching fa semi final in Wembley yesterday. Martin , the tour guide, did a great job. My son enjoyed it immensely"
187,Concert,Came here Tuesday to see the mighty Metallica play what a venue it is built for concerts as well that small football club called city the sound and the atmosphere and even though it poured it down it didn't dampen our enjoyment
188,Half of the family visiting Etihad,"Came here for the Muse gig and had no issues whats so ever. Ground staff were all pleasant and helpful and the drink prices were no different to any other stadium gig we have attended. We managed to park in a side street about 15min walk away, there is no street parking any nearer the stadium and there are wardens patrolling the surrounding streets. Note that within the stadium you cannot get a wifi signal."
189,Long service presentation.,"I visited the Etihad for a stadium tour with my Dad who is Manchester City fan, and we both had a great time.  Our tour guide Graham was so knowledgeable about Manchester City FC and the stadium and his passion for football clearly shone through.  Graham was assist by George who was a lovely young man who took photos for all the people on the tour and made sure that the group kept together.  The Etihad is very impressive and the tour is equally as impressive, lots of multi media use - we especially enjoyed the press conference at the end of the tour with Pep!  I would highly recommend the tour for all ages."
190,Concert venue,What a great place to visit especially I love Man City team you will appreciate so many activities behind the scene I will visit again :)
191,Go Manchester City,"Great stadium, clean toilets, staff helpful spice girls were excellent! Sound was brilliant even though nights prior problems."
192,Metallica ,"I have been to the Etihad a few times over the years,Pop concerts and work courses. It seems to be popular for both.Despite Man City's success in recent years it is nicknamed the Emptyhad because so few fans attend to watch football.It is certainly a decent venue for concerts,"
193,Hard wired,Came to see stadium with 15 year old son. Staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Ian and Helen gave an informative tour. Would recommend.
194,Derby! And Metallica!,"After 16 hears since I left my old position at MCC which was to lead and manage the delivery of the stadium for the 2002 Commonwealth Games and then 1 year later the final converted COM Stadium, it was nice to return and meet old friends and witness the latest inhabitants!! Plus my team scraped a draw somehow! Lol. It is wearing well and definitely worth a visit."
195,Best place in the world!,"We joined a 10 am tour on the same day as the first ever Manchester derby in the women’s superleague. On the downside this meant the tour was slightly cut short. On the plus side Football Focus was being presented from the home dressing room so we literally rubbed shoulders with Dan Walker, Phil Neville and Alex Scott. Fancy technology was used to bring things to life, such as the entry of the home team. Hospitality areas were an eye opener - how the other half live! The media areas were also interesting - you get a really good idea of the organisation that goes into match day.The best thing about the entertaining tour was the excellence of our guides David and Julie. Here were two fans, passionate about the clubs history, a font of knowledge and only too willing to share their experiences.A must for all City fans."
196,Rock Champions at the League Champions ,"I went here with my finace and friends and it was absolutely amazing. Security to get into the venue were very quick and friendly, could not fault it. There were so many choices of places to get a drink so nice and easy and no need to queue. The prices were not bad £9 for a 450ml gin and tonic so couldn't complain. The stadium was great!! Glad it didn't rain with open top. The gig was amazing!! Muse did a fantastic job and the effects were out of this world. Such a great night"
197,Ummmmm,"Wow, I'm so glad this is not my home ground. Location awful, with parking really poor.Stadium facilities nothing to write home about and as far as atmosphere goes, shocking, will not be visiting again!"
198,Metallica!!,"Attended the Stadium Tour today, both George and Fran made us feel very welcome and relaxed. Very attentive but understood when time was needed to wonder independently. Perfect tour in my eyes. Comparing this tour to the Camp Nou in Barcelona- Man City tour was MUCH better, high quality service and top quality facilities.Made me and my girlfriend wanting to get tickets to the VIP bar/Hospitality Section, seeing the players walk past and even being able to see the interview post-match!Will be recommending."
199,Etihad for concerts,The best outdoor concert I've been to. The staff were incredibly helpful and the security was fantastic to make you feel safe!
200,Metallica,"Well, what a phenomenal stadium! My second time first row, normally a little higher but it was my birthday so thought give it a go. Loved it! Sorry no picture of the half time pie but wow was it good! Beer too! Great, fast service from the guys at the bar! Thanks for a great day Etihad! I’ve told everyone I know they must go! Regardless who they support. They’ll give you a warm welcome."
201,"Metallica in the rain - so,  it's Manchester.","Had a hour to spare (whilst at Manchester Royal Infirmary) and brought my dad here as he's a Man City fan. Today was a rainy Thursday afternoon and out of season. We were impressed with the outer stadium and were directed round the stadium and shown where to park using my blue badge. We were a bit disappointed with the Citystore being refurbished and closed, however there were two concessions around the back which were open. The staff in here were extremely helpful and friendly. We were unable to find a cafe or anywhere to get a drink until we spotted a cafe open sign at the nearby England squash courts/ sports centre. Once in, there was no one around and reception staff left me standing there whilst they chatted amongst themselves. When I asked if the cafe was open, I was told firmly it was closed and to try a vending machine. This was out of order. Bit niggly that there didn't seem to be somewhere to get a warm drink despite there being plenty of people walking about and taking photos etc. I feel slightly less inclined to pay £25 each for the stadium tour...sorry Man City!"
202,Muse Simulation Theory tour.,"We visited Etihad stadium with friends and family, nice visit to the stadium, press box visit, visit to the home team and away team facilities, really nice place to visit, enjoyed the visit fully, got some really nice pictures with the friends."
203,NICE ATTRACTION FOR ANY SOCCER FAN,The atmosphere is incredibly poor - they even have speakers that produce a drumming sound - I didn't feel any passion while I was there - however the seats where comfortable!
204,Very interesting ,"Stadium was impressive, nice architecture wonderfully designed, I thought the tour was very well done, the staff were lovely but there just wasn't much history."
205,Funny Smell,"Coldplay Concert (actually was in 2016 but heard nothing has changed since in Etihad's VIP concert set up). Here's what we got for the VIP package at the Etihad stadium Manchester, UK: We got one (I'll repeat that) ONE free drink, a Coldplay Lanyard, a Coldplay badge and......that's it! The food in the VIP lounge you had to pay for and the actual concert seats were right at the back of the stadium. Oh I forgot we did get a cushion on our seat. Other people who were on the same row of seats (but on the other side of a 'rope') didn't get a cushion but paid just a 1/3 of the price we did! It's put me off for life buying VIP packages for concerts. At our next Coldplay concert, we bought just basic standing tickets (right in the middle of the stadium) and it was the best concert of our lives!  This was for many reasons including not feeling completely ripped off like last time. Have seen reviews of VIP packages at other stadiums that Coldplay played at, & by far they were ten times better - e.g free food, lots of free drinks, great seats. I do not blame the band but the Stadium organisation. Do NOT buy a VIP concert ticket at Etihad stadium, Manchester."
206,Quick Look at Stadium (Non Tour),"Graham & George - fabulous tour guides. Guests from Austria, Australia, Brazil, Argentina,  Netherlands, England & Scotland. Fans of all clubs were there to see the stadium. What a place it is too! All were made to feel very welcome by knowledgeable and attentive staff. I couldn’t fault it and we loved the day. The shop afterwards was great too. Only negative was nowhere to have lunch on-site - perhaps because it’s the summer? Was hoping to eat at the ground too but wasn’t possible. Just a suggestion for the Stadium Management to consider. Quite a few of our group may well have stopped for a bite to eat or a drink."
207,Muse concert,"I came here with work for a St Patrick's day / Gold Cup event in the Legends Lounge and had such a great time. I've been here a few times now with work and every time has been been so fun. They had a comedian and singer on and both were great. We had 2 meals there and they were both top notch as always. They even had the trophies out to take pictures with. What really made the day though was the staff - they were all so friendly and helpful. It looked liked each waiter was assigned to 2/3 tables to bring drinks over and clear the table etc. The girl we had was called Shay and she was incredible. Every time we needed a drink she just magically appeared to take our orders. It didn't take long for her to learn our orders off by heart! At one point me and my friend did end up going to the bar ourselves because we'd changed our minds about not getting a drink and Shay met us there and offered to carry them back to the table for us. She was just a lovely girl - I can't speak highly enough of her. From my experiences, all of the staff have helped to make the day better for the guests. Would highly recommend!"
208,A fantastic experience with great Tour Guides,"Brilliant hour and a half, I went with my 7 year old and we both found it really enjoyable and informative! Cameron was very knowledgable and Fun! Would recommend"
209,Wow! Brilliant venue and staff,It's supposed to be about the football.  Although the food here gets better everything we visit. Last visit was Company's Testimonial. Great Day!
210,Muse concert,"Excellent staff here which made it feel very safe. There were a few incidents during the warm up acts down in the standing area, but these were dealt with quickly with those in orange coats creating a ring around those in need and medicsl staff quickly stabilising and offering first aid. The concert entry and exit was clearly identified and the management of getting the tram at the end of the night meant people got home safely. Great concert, but wish I'd taken a blanket for my legs ss sat up at the top it got cold from the wind."
211,Muse Gig,"The stadium and its surrounding were so exciting and beautiful but the food served in the tracks outside was awful. I was the second in having a hamburger and it was cold and fluffy, as the fries though."
212,Great venue!,"It was awesome our guide, Cameron was great. I loved it the stadium is great and is a unique experience."
213,Great organisation & fantastic venue,Finally got chance to book a tour. Was better than we expected. Got to lean more about the club and a great place for the kids to get around
214,Confused,The tour was amazing. Seen so much of the stadium. Only small thing I wasn’t happy with I never got good opportunities to take photos of the Colin bell stand looking from the east stand or opposite way.  It was all down at pitch side photoOps and with the heaters on pitch didn’t get a few.  The stadium tour was amazing apart from that. I am life long city fan and was amazing seeing the tour and things that I seen.  Would love to go to a game in it one day.  The security man on tour was amazing. And really helpful with me telling me different things about city and the stadium. I done the academy part of tour. And we got taken into one building shown the press conference room out onto a pitch.  Then a drive around. It would have been nice for some photo ops of the Yaya or Kompany sign that is up. The guy taking tour said he would say when could take photos or not. He didn’t say anything though our tour until I took a photo of building and he said do not take photos here. I don’t think I would do the academy tour part again as not worth the extra £10. It would also be nice if you get a ticket or something to say you were on tour.  I have done a few stadiums in uk and you get either a certificate to say you visited stadium in the day or have a colourful ticket to keep. I normally make frames up of photo of stadium I take inside and put ticket in along with it.  Over all I am still on cloud 9 after seeing everything next time down will be a game
215,Muse,"Great tour, great Stadiun and great guides. Nathan & Lucas were knowledgable, funny and Lucas went above and beyond and retraced our steps to find my daughters ID that fell out of her pocket."
216,Restricted view at Muse Concert,Our tour was a gift to my partner for his 50th birthday. Even for myself who is not a football fan I found it very interesting. Our tour guides Keith & Julie were very friendly and were happy to take photos for you. They were well informed and gave some interesting facts whilst showing us round. If you are a Man City supporter then this tour is for you. A chance to see behind the scenes and walk where the players do.
217,Muse were amazing and the venue was good too,We joined the stadium tour and my kids enjoyed very much.  We bought phototaking online but we forgot to take the photograph after crazy shopping there.  Mancity shop staff was very kind and sent the photo to our hotel in London.  Thank you very much!
218,Very safe venue for the Muse concert,"Brought our football team down from Lanarkshire Scotland, had an amazing day on the tour the boys had a fantastic time. Special mention to Ray and Paul for all the excellent interaction with our excitable young men, they all loved the tour. Also to Calum who filled the boys in on some interesting info about the club.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 thanks again guys from all at Camby Talbot🔴⚪️⚫️"
219,Great Concert Venue,"I last visited the Etihad in June 2016, and was impressed then. Three years later it was even better and it wasn't just that  the lifts worked. I have never seen so many support staff: by every door, by every gate, by every staircase - all smiling and ready to help. The seats in the £95 section were comfortable and padded with reasonable knee room, and dry as the canopy roof extended over the seating if not the pitch or even the stage so the moshers and the band were soaking wet.My only quibble (great word, quibble) is the distance from the orange disabled car park and where our disabled friendly seating was, I'm not a great walker and use sticks so it was a bit of a pain (literally) to walk three quarters of the exterior of the stadium twice. On a safety note, we were pleased to see how quickly the stadium can be emptied, no doubt even more quickly in case of an emergency.Still not keen on stadia concerts but Etihad is still the best open air venue so far."
220,Muse,"I went on this tour with my friend of nearly 50 years and our families. She has always been blue whilst I have always been red! Our guides Lucas and Chris were so friendly and informative. Lots of laughs, often involving my son in his Man U shirt. We all loved the tour. So much information about match day preparation etc. You really felt the sense of family within stadium. The facilities for players are incredible.  Lucas and Chris made this tour so memorable. I haven't been to this stadium since I was a volunteer at the 2002 Commonwealth Games and was mightily impressed. Well done Man City."
221,Muse Concert,It was my first time in Etihad Stadium. These 2 Martin and Linda who were working there made my day in the Man City store. The Movie was too damn emotional. I should say my thanks to Linda there. Thanks to them for making my day. I love you Martin and Linda
222,MUSE concert ,"Had a very interesting tour of the Etihad Stadium for my partner's 60th Birthday. Mike and Norman (tour guides) were excellent guides and their knowledge of the stadium and the history of the club was very impressing. We as fans, are so lucky to have such a magnificent ground. Only the best for the best club in the world.IWell recommend the stadium tour. Well organised considering they run every half hour."
223,Went for a concert,It was my son's birthday and he's a big man city fan so I decided to  book a stadium tour and glad I did we all had a great time and the man doing the guided tour was very good funny and very informative
224,players  dressing room,"Got a call from my nephew saying he had a spare ticket for the game on Sunday afternoon and I accepted his kind offer.My neighbors are season ticket holders so managed to occupy a empty seat in their car.First impressions when arriving at the stadium was the amount of people around.On entering the stadium a quick drink at the bar was suggested which was the only down point of the whole experience the staff serving were very slow and when I did get my pint of Amstel it tasted sour.The seats were behind the goal in the north stand near the away supporters which created for a great atmosphere singing chanting etc.The said news city lost but I did really enjoy my visit and on leaving the stadium met with more people than I had every seen in my life,hopefully another visit won’t be as long."
225,Spice Girls Reunion Tour!!,"Could have done with some more cleaning, but I had good seats, nice and warm. Pints were bloody expensive so wasnt a fan, staff were mainly students, so not much conversation from them."
226,Professional and very friendly guides,"Great experience, Ian and Cameron were very informative and injected humour and happiness to our tour.We have been on 2 tours now and Ian and Cameron were the best , will deffo book again"
227,Frustrating travel and rip off prices,"Lucky enough to get to see the Spice Girls perform at the Etihad Stadium! Getting into the concert, through security and leaving was all very well organised and easy/fast enough. The sound was fantastic and the atmosphere was brilliant! Excellent concert experience! My only recommendation would have been to make more female toilets available for a concert of this size that is dominated by female fans! But overall fantastic experience and venue!"
228,Spice girls ,I bought the Manchester City tour tickets for my boyfriends Christmas present and we had such a lovely day. Lucas & Ian are absolutely fabulous tour guides and had a brilliant sensor of humour through out - such a credit to the company. Many thanks for a great day.
229,Spice girls concert,"Was given this a 50th birthday present but only just got around to using it this month !! I’m a lifelong City fan so it certainly wasn’t going to be a chore, however I did drag my partner along in the hope of converting her to be a blue !! The tour is professionally laid out and it’s my 3rd time of doing the tour and I can say it’s improved massively over the years !!! What made it really special was out two tour guides Mark and Martin who were hilarious from start to finish !!! Even managing to keep my partner interested in football for the full 2 hours !!! Can’t speak highly enough of them they made it all worthwhile"
230,Etihad ,"Amazing stadium tour by Mike & Ray, they were very helpful, answering all our questions, and they didn’t miss any of the excitement for the fans during the tour. I recommend anyone to go to the stadium to have the tour & watch their matches!"
231,Etihad Stadium,"Bill and I did the Etihad Stadium and FC Academy tour today, 13th April, 2019 and we would like to thank Ian for an interesting tour and insight into this amazing football club! He made us welcome, told some interesting stories and gave us some really interesting facts about the club. It was a very good experience for a very reasonable price. Thank you Man City for making it possible for all to afford this experience. Hank you once again to Ian."
232,Spice Girls Concert Manchester 2019,"Was here the day they revealed their new signing Cancelo. Was extremely surprised that there were not many fans in the shop when they revealed their brand new player. You can actually walk up to the ticket counter and will still be able to buy tickets for their premier league games, which is not what you would expect for the team that just won almost every local trophy in the last couple of years... well anyway, the stadium tour was actually quite good, the guides were awesome and witty, sharing many jokes and stories of the players."
233,Spice girls show ,"Attention, Attention!!  The Spice Girls are in the building and sound Amazing!! My first time in Manchester UK from Philly and I have always wanted to visit the Stadium.  I was impressed!!  Its Huge, the staff are amazing, well organized, and willing to help.  There are at least 2 Jumbotrons available for those who are further in the rear sk you wont miss the show.  It rained and the roof was open so if you are on the lower levels,  be prepared to get wet.  Luckily, they sale ponchos for inclement weather.  I was too excited so i didnt mind!!  The crowd got a bit rowdy during the show and the security team properly handled the situation before it got completely out of hand!!  I cant wait to visit again and actually see a game!!"
234,Spice girls ,"Excellent tour given by Dave and Martin, because it was match day there were restrictions which detract slightly"
235,Stadium and Academy tour ,"We went on this tour because we needed one where there was a Spanish audio version available, having two Spanish exchange students with us as well as 3 teenagers. The tour is well presented and our tour guides (Cameron and Judy) were helpful and informative, ready to answer any questions as well as giving the standard talks. If you are a football fan, you’ll like this tour even if you don’t support Man City because it’s as much about what a typical modern stadium provides for its players as about Man City specifically. You get to see the home and away changing rooms, go through the players’ tunnel into the dug out area, and see a variety of other aspects of the stadium as well. The opening part of the tour includes a well made 360 degree video presentation, and at different points during the tour you get to view 360 degree pictures of the area you are standing in. There is also a very clever interactive spot in the press room where you can sit at the interview table and be photographed alongside a VR version of Pep Guardiola. I am not a football fan myself, but I enjoyed the tour, so I’d guess that if you are a fan you’d like it venue more! I would recommend turning up the full 15 min in advance because you then get a chance to look around the small museum in the waiting area."
236,Etihad Stadium,"We went for a concert with our 6 year old son, staff were really lovely and helpful, someone came over to give him a wristband incase he got separated from me, and bent down to talk to him and tell him who he needed to find if lost, which put my mind at ease. A* venue for concerts"
237,Amazing stadium ,Brilliant night!! I couldn’t find a fault here. Staff was great very friendly and very helpful. There was many people visiting and there didn’t seem to be any problems from what I saw and would visit again
238,Very enjoyable,"Went to see the spice girls at the stadium with my 8 year old daughter (7 at the time) getting through the stadium & finding our seats were a breeze staff were friendly & helpful enough.Then the actual concert started, during the concert the stair wells were permanently covered with people. Now I'm not talking about people getting up & going for drinks I'm talking people couldn't be bothered to stay at their seats, stood or not. So they decided to stand in the stair wells instead. Where myself and my daughter were sat the ushers/security were a few steps up from us, so they could clearly see it all but decided to do nothing about it.Luckily myself & my daughter had the last two seats of our row so I let her have the aisle seat so she had a clear view for the spice girls & the screen.This shortly ended, during the show as a delightful idiotic young lady kept standing in front of my daughter (not at her seat in the stair well) because of this she couldn't see. So eventually I asked her politely if she could stand aside as my daughter couldn't see. Which at first she was happy to move, unfortunately the move didn't last too long. Again she stood right Infront of my daughter, so again I asked politely if she could stand aside from the stair well. This time her response was different, her abundance of attitude came out & she decided to ignore my request & began dancing and waving her arms around like an immiture idiot.As you would expect my patience were extinct at this point, as we'd paid to be where we were however I'm pretty sure the stadium do not sell tickets for the stair wells! Then believe it or not this idiotic child actually became physical & told me she would love to smack me, now another occasion when I weren't with my daughter I would of happily let this girl attempt to smack me (she wouldn't of got anywhere near) but as I had my daughter with me I had to keep pushing this girls arm off me.No thanks to any usher, this vile creature carried on. Then my daughter got upset & wanted to leave because of said tool! Thanks to the lovely group of women that were sat next to us, they dealt with the idiot, whilst I tried to calm my daughter down & take her home. We were lucky that the said idiot began this towards the end of the show so we didn't really miss much when we had to leave because of her.How is it that anyone is supposed to want bring. Their children to this stadium for concerts when you clearly cannot control the crows once in the facility?I will never attempt to go anywhere near your establishment again & I will mention it to all other parents that consider it also.Money is clearly the only thing on the agenda when attending a concert here, once your in they clearly don't care of the experience.Zero reagrds,One time Etihad visitor"
239,Smokers at concert,I had a great time at the match with my mate Steve. Had a pint at half time with a pie and we won so it was a top day.
240,Spice Girls,Extremely expensive drinks & food..ridiculous Loos ok....Staff brilliant...Surrounding area to stadium so scruffy and uncared for... loads of litter.
241,Etihad tour - simply amazing,"We visited the Etihad yesterday for a conducted tour and were very impressed. The tour was comprehensive and very interesting. My husband and I went with our son and grandson, all City fans except for my husband but even he, a Manchester United supporter, enjoyed it.Thanks to Cameron and Elena for making it such a great experience."
242,Spice Girls,"This is a good quality tour, but we went on a Saturday during internationals week and felt that the club had tried to cram in too many tours. It was rushed in places then we were left waiting for 5 minutes in other areas. It's ok value for what you get, but the store is obviously a complete rip off."
243,Spice Girls ,As non Man City fans we still really enjoyed this tour.The tour was delivered in a very enthusiastic and informative way. It was suitable for all age fans and non fans. It’s a club with lots of history and a lovely stadium so if you’re interested it’s worth it!
244,Spicy visit ,Been to Etihad twice now for concerts Spice Girls and Taylor Swift last yearBoth times we’ve been up very high and had a really good experienceFood / drinks are pricey but you don’t have to eat there !Both times used trams to get to the venue from Manchester City Centre and although obvs busy    had no problems Tip - get on the tram to the stadium before it gets the very very busy stops at Picc gardens and Piccadilly
245,Spice Girls - Spectacular Show,HA! United till I die! But this place is beautiful NOTHING compared to ours but you have to give it to them. credit is due.
246,Great venue for concerts,This was a real treat. We had a small group and a tremendous guide who was really well informed. Lots of great behind the scenes visits to changing rooms and so on. Great history.
247,Spice girls concert!,"Our guide, Graham, was great. He knew the history told us lots of stories and was really friendly. He was very enthusiastic and welcomed questions."
248,Spice Girls Concert,We went to watch the game. The was incredible. The support of Manchester City was friendly and so into the game that makes us want they to win and they did. I definitely will return to watch another game.
249,Great venue for the blue run,"Took this on the day of the Vincent Company testimonial 11/9/2019. Fran and Ian our guides and hosts made it informative and fun. Even if you don't support City it's an  interesting insight into how Premier League clubs are run. I remember many games at Maine Road and had to pinch myself at how far the club has progressed. On a match day, some parts of the tour are restricted (player areas) so if you want a full tour, book a non match day. The shorter match day tour was still worth it and I'd recommend it."
250,Wonderful Experience ,"I’m biased I’ve been a blue for 45yrs! 15/01/20 my daughter and myself took my mother on the tour! It was my mother’s 78th birthday that’s why we went, she watched her 1st game at the age of 8! The tour guides Martin and George were absolutely amazing, they really made my mums day even more special! The guides were informative and super knowledgeable.We weren’t rushed in any way were allowed to take countless photos! Fantastic tour would highly recommend! Might not have the silverware but we certainly have the history, for any football fan it’s a must!"
251,Great experience,"My boyfriend drags me here as a city season ticket holder, as someone who isn’t the biggest football fan I was never expecting much upon my first game here. However, I’ve started coming regularly to the etihad because the atmosphere is amazing!!! Everyone is so friendly and it’s a good day out"
252,Just WOW!!,"stewards were rude and unhelpful, seem rather unbothered about their jobs. I was told off for trying to go through a door despite it being my first time in the stadium and having no clue where to go"
253,It's the enemy but you have to give it to them,"Had a most fantastic and amazing time at the Manchester City Stadium Tour. Fun, enjoyable, and pretty much much full on for the 3 hours with the tour of the academy rolled in. Ian, Paul, and Keith were a joy....full of knowledge, a pleasure to be around, and very relaxed. It was a present for my boys 7th birthday, and the entire family had such a great time. Reasonably priced and I would certainly do it again....well worth a visit whether you are a city fan or just love the game. Highly recommended. G"
254,Amazing day,I’m not a football fan but went along for the day. What can I say Martin and Jamie were our tour guides they were so knowledgeable and very funny and they even convinced me to go and watch a match.Brilliant afternoon especially with those two guides well worth a visit
255,Good stadium tour at reasonable price,"A really impressive stage, sound and lights set up. Our tickets had us so high up we were almost outside, I literally had the wall to my back. I could have carried out some engineering inspections of the roof I was so high up, and our tickets were not the cheapest seats!!!!Metallica get 5 stars, it’s the venue I’m giving four green circles. It’s a large stadium, good signage and directions, but a bit basic."
256,Super fun and informative tour,Went to the Etihad last night to watch Muse. I found the venue was spot venue for the gig. The stadium was very accessible by the tram and the stewards at stadium were very efficient in directing you to your seats and into the right queues when leaving the venue at the end of the show.
257,Thank you,"Amazing! That s all i can say,the tour went very fine. We visited several places inside. . I believe the experience went so well, because our guide Ian,was very nice, polite, funny, explains everything so well, asking who wasnt native(like me) if we undestand all he was saying.Five stars!😊"
258,Great tour,"I cannot speak highly enough of the Staff or the experience we have today. We arrived late but through great communication were still able to do both tours we had paid for. From the booking team to Steve, Martin and Mike the Tour guides we were so impressed. The knowledge and passion for the club they all showed really shown through. I would even say any fan of football of would enjoy the tour. For me learning about the development and the Man City way was brilliant and Both my kids (8/15) left with lots to ponder.We completed the stadium tour and academy tour and were accommodated because of bad traffic which I know other tours don’t do! I’m not going to spoil what you see or what is said but it’s definitely worth it. Thanks to everyone."
259,Informative but not theMost exciting or comprehensive tour,We took the stadium tour with Steven as our group guide and it was really amazing experience. The tour is really interesting and very well organized.
260,A Great Stadium,"We had a great time during the tour. We got to see all the special places and because it was not a Matchday we had plenty of time.Martin, our tourleader, rocked. He is agreat storyteller and answered all questions. Compliments."
261,Match,Cameron made the tour a great one! I learned a lot of new things about Man City - can’t wait for the game tomorrow.
262,Great new tour,Today I went to get a tour and met two guys before who were supposed to get a tour 3 hr later. The staff was really flexible to put us all on the same much earlier tour. We had two great guys Ian & Graham who made our day 😃 These are nice guys with a large amount of knowledge and a good sense of humor. I would recommend to wait for them. It is a beautiful stadium..
263,What a great tour with very nice guides,I actually went to Manchester to see the ManCity vs Brighton.... what a game... stadium... absolutely unforgetable... great pitch.... and great game... and Kun scored... !
264,Utterly magical experience if you are a City fan,"We watched a UEFA CL match between Manchester City and Shakhtar Donetsk and we had a great experience. The stadium is really comfortable, the services are great and the club store is amazing."
265,Great stadium ,There were some very impressive features such as the videos in the gym and the photo opportunity in the press conference room.
266,Beyoncé and Jay Zee,"enjoyed   being in the  room, was  proudly sitting  where Vincent  Kompany was  captain  changed ,greatly missed player."
267,Great European Stadium,Took the tour with my family and we loved every minute of it. We’re not soccer fans per say but it was fun learning about Manchester City’s history and their beautiful new stadium.
268,Stadium Tour,"I was so excited about finally seeing Beyoncé live and found the evening quite disappointing.The seats and surrounding areas were dirty. The worst thing was, a few seats from mine a couple of mums were buying their young teenage girls countless bottles of cider and then openly handing out small pills from a small plastic bags.The stewards appeared not to notice at all, in fact not looking at the crowds at all.I couldn’t believe this had all got past the security checks. It left me feeling quite sick and terribly sad.I did ring the events number at the stadium the next day  and spoke to a lovely lady who was very concerned about what I’d told her. I’m sure she tried to get to the bottom of it. I hope things get stricter. My husband says they are strict on match days. I wouldn’t know about that."
269,City stadium tour,Took the stadium tour in October.Really good experience!Had previously done the Maine Road tour which was good and my husband has done the Etihad a few years ago.This one though has recently been upgraded and well worth a visit even if you did the earlier Etihad tour. The guides were very informative (I think they were Callum and Ray).Would highly recommend this.
270,Manchester city stadium tour ,We had the best tour!  It was absolutely fantastic!  The facility is beautiful and the tour is fun and filled with information!
271,Manchester City Stadium Tour,Managed to grab tickets off a friend for a home game against Shef Utd. We sat in the business seats which was better as we had a great view and access to a proper bar.
272,Good but don’t do it on a match day,"Thank you for the friendly guide who accompanied us in the presentation of the stadium this Friday morning, thank you for his humor and kindness.And a big hello from France.Etienne DERVIL"
273,Very good!,"I was appalled by the way we were treated by your event staff on Door K. As the scanner on the barrier wouldn’t validate our tickets we had to go to the box office, join another long queue to get our tickets reprinted to a format compatible for your scanner. On attempting to regain entry through the barrier where we had been led out from at Door K, we were rudely instructed to re-join the back of queue again. After nearly two hours I had one young daughter in tears as we had missed seeing Jess Glyn and my adult pregnant daughter feeling faint by the length of time spent queuing. I was appalled at your staff’s lack of empathy or awareness of procedures to follow when your system breaks down and I was disgusted with the manor in which I was marched away from Door K. I was made to feel like a criminal.  Your staff need training to improve their customer relation. I will not be returning to this venue again"
274,"Although local, visited with a USA touring party. April 16th 2019.","The tour was booked to coincide with the Leicester City game on the Saturday, but the match was moved to Monday and we could not go. However we moved the tour very easily to the Sunday. We were advised the tour we were doing was new, and had a few teething issues, however, apart from running late, and having to leave the tour before it finished this was very very enjoyable. The guides were very knowledgable and had a great sense of humour.  Was very impressed with the facilities for both home and away teams, and going out to the pitch was exciting.  The best bit though was the press room and everyone on our tour thoroughly enjoyed this.  By the way I am not a football fan, but was with a city season ticket holder, and an American soccer mum.  Well worth the money"
275,Amazing!,"Terrible! Absolutely Terrible football team with the worst stadium I have ever been to! The seats are terrible, so is the food! Worst of all is that their team is complete and utter nonsense!"
276,Great first experience in an England football match,"Went there with 8,000 fellow vale fans and what an amazing stadium....it’s like it’s from another planet ......it’s not 5 stars......it’s 11 stars"
277,Brilliant,"Went to ManCity v Dinamo Zagreb Champions league game.Stadium facilites fantastic,the City fans however were really dull.Talk about only sing when your winning, stadium had 49,000 with probably only 2,000 Dinamo fans ( they were slightly over enthusiastic) without whom the match would have been boring.So Stadium superb , Team and fans need to up their game."
278,Tour of the stadium,"My first time attending a CAHN event.  They chose the right venue. The staff, food and the room we were in (Legends) was perfect.  I would definitely recommend holding a big dinner/ball event here. We were even aloud to go and take pictures in the ground ( not the pitch). Hospitality was good too.5*****"
279,Business package,What can I say. State of the art stadium. Aesthetically magnificent. All of the facilities are of world class.
280,Go go City,We had a great time and the tour was well worth the money. I have a 16 & 12 year old and they didn’t want the tour to end. Ian was a very knowledgeable tour guide. I would highly recommend it!
281,Spectacular,"Place was boring, nothing there and no trophies,  also had a funny smell kinda like horse manure, wouldn't recommend the place to anyone, try old Trafford ."
282,Tour,"We went on the tour this week myself, my partner, and our 9 year old and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Our tour guide was Cameron, he was really funny, very helpful, he answered all of the questions from everyone and told us some really interesting facts. We all got chance to get involved, my son was the captain leading the team out of the tunnel !  and got to take part in a press conference.   Highly recommended, my son wants to go back, just hope we get Cameron again !!"
283,"Best team, great Stadium","We saw Muse here on Saturday 8 June, and were completely blown away by everything - the performance, the lighting, the effects, the sound, the sunset! The Etihad is a fantastic venue for this type of event, and if you want to enjoy the sunset, choose high seats on the South East side - we were in block 307. But don't choose seats 218 & 219 - these did seem to be a bit precarious, at the very top of a steep set of concrete steps - one false move ... The organisation at the venue is second to none - fantastic, friendly security staff who will help you every step of the way. You aren't allowed to take your own food or drink into the venue, but the food & drink outlets inside will refill your empty bottle with water. Alternatively, an unopened 500ml bottle of water is allowed. Back to the food & drink outlets - they are ridiculously expensive! The toilet facilities are good, expect queues at peak times. In the God's seats we were cold to begin, you do feel a draught, and it was a cold & rainy day in June. But it does warm up once the gig gets going - would recommend bringing a fleece just in case! Transport to & from the stadium is very good, but it did get rammed after the gig, maybe because there were other events going on in Manchester. The organisation before and after was excellent, plenty of staff to help facilitate and manage the crowds, let them help you, they really are lovely!!"
284,Stadium visit,"Watched a few matches here  great atmosphere, its amazing what city have done to regenerate the area, I remember it well when it was a waste land. I applaude city for what they have done for the local community"
285,Mike Was Magic !!!,Poor atmosphere and hundreds of empty seats. No wonder they call it the Emptyhad. I thought this was going to be great day out but the lack of fans and atmosphere ruined it.
286,Son's Birthday treat,"I am a football fans from Indonesia , it's a honor for me to see a football match from the motherland football. Remember to have a ticket first before you go to stadium.  Easy and no rush when we entering the stadium.  It's still 30 min before the match Manchester City vs Sheffield United , easy access to in and outGreat atmosphere , great view and spectacular stadium.  In the half match,  we still can have time for snacks and drinks."
287,From Italy to Manchester City ,We came here with our 8 year old son and had a fab time. I feel it was all down to our tour guides as to why it was so good. Martin and George. They were not only fun but knowledgeable as well. Their job was tested as we were joined by about 15 Arabic men with a translator but they rose to the occasion and coped extremely well. We found out so much and saw so much. I totally recommend this tour to any football fan. Lovely stadium too.
288,Okay ,We we were visiting the UK from the USA and I took my husband as a surprise birthday treat as he is a City fan.  The tour was amazing. Dave Oldham was our tour guide and he was fantastic! It is nice to get a tour from a real fan of City!!  My daughter who is 11 was amazed to be able to see where her favorite players get ready.  Lots of time to take pictures and soak in the atmosphere of being there.  All three of us loved it!
289,Etihad tour,"We went to watch a game and it was a great atmosphere, we love it. My kids were over the moon. Easy to get in after safety checks. Good hotdogs too😁"
290,An excellent tour,Great match against Leicester City super winner from Vincent Kompany to put City back on top of the Premier League.
291,Stadium tour Etihad ,"I was here as a conference exhibitor. Unfortunately, our courier messed us and our stuff did not arrive for the exhibition (no fault of the stadium whatsoever). Despite this, the experience of being at the Etihad stadium was very enjoyable. The staff here are an absolute credit- so lovely, helpful and funny. They did their absolute best to help us with the courier mix up and kept us in high spirits and should be commended for their positive and helpful attitudes! The toilets here are also super nice- fancy Jo Malone handsoap."
292,Etihad stadium tour,"Thanks to Nathan, Lucas and Ian for what turned out to be a fabulous and informative tour. They were extremely knowledgable, enthusiastic and very easy to listen to. It was great to visit so many areas behind the scenes and the video with Pep Guardiola was great fun. No part of the tour felt rushed and plenty of time was given for you to sit in your favourite players changing spaces (a particular highlight for my daughter). The academy tour shows the importance they place on developing young talent and the whole person. Would highly recommend this tour which took just under 3 hours."
293,Excellent tour,Great match by a great team and a extraordinarily good coach Pep Guardiola from Barcelona Catalana . City won 3-0
294,The best experience you can have,Lucas and Josh provided my Dad and I with a fantastic insight to behind the scenes at the Etihad!! Amazing to see inside the dressing room and walk out the tunnel. Doing a press conference with a virtual Pep is an amazing feature! Thank you for a great tour lads 👍🏼
295,Stadium Tour,"Take a look behind the scenes of the best team in the world. If you’re lucky, Cameron Will be your guide, with some witty comments."
296,Very interesting tour,"Thank you to Graham and Martin for our amazing school tour, yet again you’ve given the students a truly wonderful experience."
297,Stadium tour.,I had never been to a stadium of this size. I was blown away at the sheer magnitude. It was breath taking. A friend and I traveled from the US to see the Spice Girls concert (sans Posh). We had an amazing time and danced in the rain all night!The pitch was covered so it made walking (and dancing) really easy. We were 10 feet away from the Spice Girls while they were performing. It was a night to remember. I was also impressed at how well the crowd was managed. Getting in out was pretty efficient. Only downside was everyone trying to catch the trains back to the city. But thats to be expected with so many people.Would have been nice to catch a Man City game here. Perhaps next time!
298,Great stadium to tour!,Great atmosphereGreat foodGreat seatsGreat footballGreat teamGreat management Great experienceGreat expectations Great mascotsGreat feelings of joy
299,Stadium Tour,"Un tuffo di un’ora e mezza nella storia del Manchester City, con un’eccellente guida: Mario Balotelli... ooops no con Martin, molto simpatico e gentile! Mio cugino tifoso del City si è sentito un vero calciatore!! A jump of one hour and an half inside the history of Manchester City, with an excellent guide: Mario Balotelli... ooops no with Martin, very nice and kind!! My little cousin, who is a fan of City, he felt like a real football player."
