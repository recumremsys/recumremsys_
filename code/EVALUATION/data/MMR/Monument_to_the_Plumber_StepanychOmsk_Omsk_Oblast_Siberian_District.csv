0,Quirky monument ,"I'm not sure why this is the #1 sight in the city. Cute, and quirky, worth a quick photo before moving on."
1,Fun and unusual sculpture ,"Omsk has a sense of humour!! Another of the huge numbers of metal sculptures around town, but this one is fun!!"
2,Hug to be free of plumbing problems,"Intriguing statue coming out of the sewer/drain, worth a photograph, an unusual thing to see in a public area"
3,Intriguing sculpture,This is one of several street sculptures that will surprise you as you walk around Omsk center - a man (Stepan) coming up out of a manhole
4,Nice to see,"This was strange like one we saw in the Czech Republic or perhaps Bratislava, can't remember.  A statue of a man, the plumber, coming out of a manhole.  Interesting but not at -31 which was the temperature when we saw it."
5,Surprise ,"This is a small symbol of the city. Is on Lubinsky Avenue, where just a pleasant stroll. The statue itself - a plumber who comes out of the hatch. He can take a photo. Next to him there are other statues, such as Luba."
6,Fun!,Place to do good photos. Not difficult to find (if it's not under the snow). Across the street you can find more monuments where it's possible to make good photos.
7,Statue,"In the centre of the city in Lenina Road, a unique and beautifully crafted lifelike, iron bust of a man is to be found, seemingly standing inside a manhole and resting for moment, his pipe tongs within reach ready to be picked up to continue his work. Stepan the Plumber will however forever gaze calmly at each passerby, maybe wondering what they might be thinking if they stop for a moment and stare down at this man of steel, his years of labour as a plumber in summer and indescribable cold winters clearly etched in his rough hewn face and strong and weather beaten hands. A small piece of magic yet again which surprises one every time and one seldom passes this landmark without stopping, sometimes bending down to have a closer look at this patient plumber and wonder if he sometimes step out of his hole late at night and meet up with the other iron statues, discussing the day and strange creatures that stops and stares at them in awe any time of the day or early evening. A jewel not to be missed when one visits Omsk and which add some mystique to the centre of Omsk. The monument to the plumber Stepanych, was created by sculptors S. N. Noryshev and I. A. Vakhitov, and erected in 1998 during the celebration of the city's anniversary."
8,Surprising sculpture,"One of THE mementos of Omsk is a snapshot next to Stepan the Plumber, a permanent feature of the picturesque Lenin Street. You won't want to pass him by! He is always there, sticking his head out of the ground!"
9,Timeless,This is a must-see. I was first introduced to it 10 years ago and was heartened to see Stepan still smiling at all the passers-by a decade later.
10,Nice monument,"The monument to the plumber Stephan, is one of the symbols of Omsk. Many tourists stop here to take a photo with Stephan. The sculpture is one of many sculptures on Lenin Street. The sculpture is actually at the intersection of Karla Libknekhta and Lenin Street. He stares across the street at the Lubya sculpture sitting on a bench, and the Van Gogh and Rutger Hauer sculptures, which are in front of the Bevitore Bar and Restaurant.The local saying is that if you give Stephan a hug, which is quite difficult as the sculpture is at ground level, your house will be free of plumbing problems. This is a great photo op in Omsk, and the nearby gift shops will probably have images of Stephan. If you walk further north on Lenin Street, the Lenin statue will be seen. If you walk south on Lenin Street, the marker of the site of the historic Omsk Fortress gate will be seen and the Seraphim Alekseyevskaya Chapel. If you walk on Karla Libknekhta Street, there are quite a few F&B options, and if you turn right at the intersection with Partizanskaya Street, the Omsk Gate will come into view."
11,Eternal patience,The monument is a sweet present from the city municipality to the citizens. It is situated in the very center of the city and is surprisingly different from regular moments dedicated to specific events or famous people. This is a monumet of a typically Russian plumber which gives you a different prospective on Russian culture and daily life showing a smiling simple worker during his workday in the middle of the central street. It creates a refreshing experience of breaking the routine of a regular urban sightseeing. Very nice and a must when in Omsk!
12,VICTORY  DAY IN OMSK RUSSIA,Found this amusing. A plumber coming out of a manhole in the middle of the street. Well done with something fun and surprising
13,Fun,"Our map showed us a different street, it is actually just on the main road of the city. Once we found it it was great to take pictures with!"
14,This is a small symbol of the city,"When walking the Lenin-Street be aware of this smart guy just exiting the mines. You immediately start asking yourself, what he has found below..."
15,Great and unusual statue,"Visit Omsk Russia On May 9 the day Russia celebration  of victory day....all the old soviet history is pulled out and put all over the City center  Posters,flags,huge statue of a russian soldier that stands in victory park....and at night the firework celebrations  of Russia victory  over NAZI Germany and the Siberia  russian  city was built right on the Irtish river which you can take a boat ride down the river and see one part you will pass because it flows into china......GO to St Nicholas  Church  and watch the old orthodoxy  clergymen  lead age old worship for the citizens of omskYou will never forget  omsk,russia"
16,Very Refreshing,Well was nice to meet the famous Stepan the plumber was a very cold day and snow all around but had to get down with him for a quick photo you see Stephan everywhere in the souviner shops and so great to see the real thing
