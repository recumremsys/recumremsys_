0,Parking Was Impossible & Rowdy Crowds,So much hype. So many rowdy tourist. Don't understand what's the big deal. No parking and difficult to get around.
1,Average at best,"Very cool area to appreciate street art. It is crowded, however. Very trendy area with plenty of cool photo opportunities. Lots of small boutiques and shops in the neighborhood as well."
2,Art district,Free and open wall art.  Many blocks with shops and some restaurants.  Definitely worth the visit.  Pictures do not do it justice.  The restaurants in the area are also unique and worth sampling.
3,Love the murals,The walls change every year.  Lots of new restaurants and shops in the area.  Sign up for a tour at the store.  It’s $20 and worth the money.  Ask for Lance Durham.  Lance is very knowledgeable and passionate about the art.#LanceDurham

People were taking their modded cars around to do photoshoots in front of their favorite pieces. Don't miss Cielito Artisan Pops when you're there.  We had a pineapple mint popsicle with chocolate and coconut on it-- such a nice refresher after a long walk. Really cute cafes in the area, too!"

27,Great- a must see!!,"It started as a project to reinvigorate a dying area of Miami. And it’s awesome. There are lots of people taking selfies in front of the art, but you can appreciate the art as much as you’d like. Many blocks surrounding the walls also have amazing street art."
28,Graffiti everywhere,It was a fun evening. Great place to look at street arts and dine. Wear comfortable shoes because it’s a long walk. Stop by El Patio for some Latin music and dance.
29,Wynwood wonders,Great walking around amongst the walls. Good modern art. A bit crowded but ok. Free! :) Parking is available in a garage nearby
30,Amazing Grafitti Art,"Amazing street art accessible to all. Great food options too. I thought there would be a little more art retail, but maybe we hit it at the wrong time."
31,A rare experience,"Loved this, the art work and atmosphere of the place, there’s so many great walls of art and a couple of indoor area’s with smaller modern art pieces- all incredible. Out of all the places I visited in Miami this was my favourite. If after visiting here you walk a couple of minutes down the road there’s a place called Wynwood Market place. It has a couple of bars and food trucks, small pieces of art and crafts to buy plus you can watch graffiti artists creating artwork. I can’t recommend these places enough"
32,Lovely art,Loved this area of Miami - The walls are so amazing and then wondering round the streets looking at all the art work on the walls and the pavement.  Really enjoyed the few hours we spent here and would definitely recommend.

34,A must see,"Stopped here during a Big Bus Tour. Got there right before they opened, long line to get in. Once in the crowd kinda dispersed and you are able to see things easily.  Very impressive artwork that changes. There are also murals on the streets surrounding. Unbelievable that it is a free thing to do. Highly reccomend if you have some time to spare. There is a shop and a couple art galleries inside. Didn't go into the restaurant, but looked cute. Fun find."
35,"Cool place, far from the center",This Place is Really something to se in Miami. I recommand it to everyone. About 20 minute a from Miami Beach
36,A highlight experience in Miami!,"We didn't book any of the tours, we walked around ourselves and read the little signs they had. Might have been more interesting with a tour guide, depending what information they tell you on the tour. But it is easy enough to navigate around yourself. We also went at night and there are plenty of lights to see the artwork."
37,"""Amazing""","Great area that is clearly up and coming, the wall art is amazing and all free to look around. Lovely restaurants in this area. On a visit from England and recognised a wall artist KOBRA who did a wall in Bristol UK"

41,Pretty nice!,"Here's a neighborhood dedicated to murals.  Not only is the official area covered, but walls in the streets around also have joined in.  The murals are detailed and sophisticated, telling stories that draw you in.  Some are colorful and joyful.  Some are muted and serious.  These are some serious artists.  Wynwood Walls is definitely a great place to spend a few hours in Miami."

51,Much fun,"Wonderful part of the city filled with art of all kinds, most of it painted on buildings big and small.   Cafes and bars fill the spaces in between but the people of the area obviously embrace this beautiful “peoples” art exhibit.  No tagging here!!   It’s sacred ground for a lot of talented people.    Well worth a taxi or Uber ride from downtown.    A worthy investment of a few hours."
52,Visit  to Wynwood Walls,Such a cool place to visit and walk around. Neighborhood has a great vibe and so many people walking through. Very interesting art displays and wonderful that it is free. If you’re in Miami you must take an hour or 2 to see this. Also mus t have breakfast at Zak’s Bakery.

62,Fabulous street art,"Such a cool area.  The art, stores and restaurants are something no other area offers.     We had 90 spare minutes but wish we had a couple more hours to walk around.  You can walk it in an hour if your just want to look around but I highly recommend looking at the sweet little shops and quasi museum they have set up."

67,Eclectic!,"We highly recommend to come here over the weekend to skip the crowds. Pls also remember that the key graffities are opened up at given hours. If you are slightly too late, no worries, there is a lot to see around. Watch out for a few tourist traps parkings in the close proximity."
68,Good place to visit,I visited this fantastic place i January. I forgot to make a reviewm- I hope this kind of place will stay open in corona days. Its big and averything is placed in open areas.Its a must visit i Miami.
69,Very cool,Highly Recommend! Artists use different kinds of material to make arts.  A lot of art pieces to see. Colorful here. Good photo spot. free entrance!
70,Disappointed ,What a wonderful gift to an area.  Beautiful art and a great “vibe.” I loved it all.  Don’t miss it! I loved the surrounding area as much as I did the actual walls.  The Pepto Bismarck colored butterfly location was my absolute favorite. What amazing creativity.
71,Fantastic - and I am not particularly a 'street art' fan,"Very nice. Young nieces enjoyed food and shopping. Pitty the day ended bad when someone opened the car trunk and stole our friends’ stuff. You better be careful, never leave shopping bags in the car. And, cameras not always working. Anyway, we enjoyed the color and fresh walk and food all around."
72,One of the must see,"so pretty, so good to go in the night with  kids, safe to walk  y too many thing to see and to many place to go eat"

76,Area open 24 hours!,What a pleasure to find this treasure in Miami! The most beautifully creative graffiti art I’ve ever seen. As special to Miami as the wonderful mural art is to Philly. Don’t miss it!!!
77,Must see attraction in Miami,"A must do for any creative types visiting Miami. Start at the Shepard Fairey walls and go out from there. This is not just graffiti, it is beautiful art! Amazing!"
78,DEFINATELY go,"This very trendy art area does delivery with interesting shops, blue basketball court, decent brewery’s and restaurants. The art is everywhere featuring someone of the biggest names in commercial graffiti. Their are galleries, sculptures, and mural enough place for photos or amazing people of any age."
79,Fun time!,If your in Miami this is an awesome place to stop. The art is amazing. The graffiti museum was very helpful explaining art the artist in the neighborhood. Loved it!!!
80,Love love love the colours,Wywood walls official is great as well as Amazing street art on  many of the adjacent streets . The new Museum of Graffiti was a great place to visit ! That district is a great spot to visit and walk around !
81,Fabulous Your of Wynwood Walls,"Just go over there, absolutely worthwhile, beautiful district and this walls are so incredible, fully free tour, beautiful painting street art, just amazing and then walk around to see all great street art painting all around the Design District area, worthwhile to go over there."
82,Nice!!,Decided to go out to wynwood Walls based off of recommendations on what to do in Miami on trip advisor. We chose to rent bikes and bike from Miami Beach to wynwood Walls. Probably the biking itself and going across the bridges was more enjoyable than anything else. Wynwood Walls itself was not overly impressive to me. I guess it just depends on what you're into. Much of it just looks like graffiti to me. Some of it was very beautiful though. Definitely hit or miss.😐
83,Open air,A definite in your visit to Miami!  Leave time to walk thru the different buildings that have been painted.  It will be worth your time.
84,Liked it,Second time I visited wynwood walls with the owners and operators: this was awesome! The street art is continuingly changing with new walls being painted almost each month.The guide is local and has been experiencing the changes for some time. His descriptions and details are super interestingA must have as part of your stay in Miami
85,Nice drive by viewing,The art on these walls are amazing and it covers every taste. We almost didn’t go which would been a mistake.
86,Windwood ,Hidden well away from the most popular sights is a small district where the artists rule with their colours and dreams and creative sense. Very popular but worth the effort.
87,Visually Stunning and Spiritually Moving ,"Beautiful wynwood, very artsy with spray painted art almost everywhere they can! Beautiful by a sunny day and even at night too. Perfect for photos."
88,Amazing Artwork,It’s always nice to drive around wynwood and take great pictures in the walls! There are good restaurants around the area like lucky 7 for and ice cream or coyo tacoAlso to find designing clothes You find interesting stuff
89,Wonderful artwork!!,"I love this up and coming area of Miami! The displays are open and free to the public. Even visiting on a dreary, rainy day didn’t stop the vibrant colors from jumping out from the murals. The work done by the artists is incredible and usually depicts political, cultural subject matter."
90,Highly recommend,Strolling around by foot in Wynwood and you cannot miss the Walls. Quite amazing and when you are tired you can find good restaurants everywhere.
91,Wynwood Walls is a Must!,"If you love art, you can not miss this. There are neighborhood wall paintings and curated art work, you are swimming in it left and right.  You can kill three hours early there to get yourself lost."
92,Great place with great atmosphere,"Easiest fun - go, see, enjoy ! Surrounded by a cool scene - of which the walls are a fundamental component - of people, sights, sounds and tastes."
93,A MUST!,"This is a beautiful collection of wall murals, aka street art.  Plan to spend about 20 minutes.  We saw it as part of a tour that kept us there longer, but it was enough time to use the restroom at the bakery down the street.  There was no restroom at the site itself.  Really fun stop."
94,Lots to see!,A fun neighbourhood of murals and real art with fun restaurants and clubs nearby. Wynwood Place is worth visiting.
95,Wynwood Walls Tour,"Street art is always big, bold, and in your face. Walls in Wynwood is one of the great street art experiences. Don't miss it!"
96,Wow!,"It is a must while in Miami! The Wynwood walls area was vibrant and fun to explore. Lots of colors and local art work, also some tasty places to eat in the district. Loved it!"

98,Food and Art,A definite stop when in Wynwood or Miami for that matter! The art on the walls are stunning! Highly recommended!
99,The Heart of Midtown Miami,"Not many free things you can do in Florida. My whole family enjoyed the art, parking was relatively close and easy even though is was one of the busiest travel weeks of the year in Miami. We spent about 45 min there, well worth the detour into the city. Driving there was pretty easy."
100,Stunning,"My wife did the research about places to see in Miami and I was not looking forward to Wynwood Walls. I was very wrong. This is a cool spot and fun neighborhood. Definitely worth an hour or two in Miami, go to a brewery down there as well."
101,Artsy ,We started at the main Wynwood Walls commercial area and went through the various galleries and mural areas. Really enjoyed the diversity of artists that were represented there. We also walked the neighbourhood a bit to explore the murals everywhere else. Ended up at Wynwood Brewing for a couple pints. Would recommend the area and the brewery for a visit while in Miami.
102,Amazing,"So much fantastic street art here! We hopped off here on our bus tour and spent maybe 2 hours wandering the streets looking at the art, there are also lots of artisan cafes and shops in wynwood to pass the time, very bohemian and interesting place!"
103,Wonderful way to spend an afternoon ,Find a parking spot ( maybe hard to find) . Wear comfortable shoes as it is not limited to 2520 address. Walk around there is plenty of artwork on other streets
104,Great Sights,Very beautiful made for a nice afternoon.  Def worth taking a look.  Walking around the district is filled with very beautiful murals and nice restaurants
105,Well worth a visit,Great paintings to wander around and have a look at. Parking can be expensive so tink ahead where you will park
106,Great artistic place in Miami,Must see.  Beautiful art.  If you have time in your day take it and spend it here.  You won't regret it.
107,Awesome experience,We came by to see the transformation of a warehouse district into an artists enclave. Quite a “site for sore eyes”. But. It is graffiti glorified. None the less if you want to see big art it’s here
108,Awesome artwork,"Taking a tour of the graffiti wall art is well worth the  price. There are many types of tours, walking, small open bus, and different lengths of time. Our tour guide was very well informed on the history of the walls and the artists."
109,Celebrate art,"Very interesting, must visit !  I am usually not much on “modern art” but this was very enjoyable.  Many interesting and also thought provoking displays. Really have to see it and also soak in the surrounding atmosphere. My personal favorite is by far Kobra"
110,What a place. A must see if in Wynwood ,Lance was our guide  He was very well informed on the origin and growth of Street Art and the artists. Great interaction with the tour group . Very friendly .Our visit to the gardens exceeded all expectations!! Wonderful place !!!
111,Best place in Miami,This is one of the places you have to go when you visit Miami. Super interesting and you need to walk bike or drive around as many many many walls have street art on them.
112,Wowed by Wynwood,Modern art on display for all!  The modern interpretation of street art brought to a higher level!  An excellent way to display and view a modern art form.
113,Nice art plus other stuff,Cool place to walk and enjoy the deco of older buildings done with talented graffiti artists that have transferred an old district of Miami.  Different artists with different styles but so enjoyable and it is free.
114,A must have in Miami,"Terrific way to begin to gentrify a neighborhood. The murals created by the graffiti artists were diverse and inspiring. There were both indoor and outdoor spaces all covered with art work. Vendors sold ice cream, and there were several restaurants near by and on the premises. The line to enter the shop was very long, and my time was limited because I was on a tour. My son and I enjoyed the walls.."
115,A good contrast to museums,We visited on a Saturday evening. Some of the art was interesting but the number to people who just wanted to use the walls as a backdrop for selfies was frustrating.
116,Blow Your Art Mind,If in Miami make the trip to Wynwood Walls spend a few hours enjoying the art get something to eat at the many eateries you can make a day of it if you want.
117,Unique experience that I’ll definitely do again!,I took my fiancé around the area enjoyed the wall and the foods... great place to enjoy and soak in art
118,Wall to wall impressive!,Saw this area from the top of an open top bus. Some great work. If I had been able to I would loved to have walked the area.
119,Amazing artwork,We heard about Wynwood and the Walls and we were astonished about the art and the magnitude of the paintings everywhere.it is a great place to start a day and  We strolled north for lunch and ended up at the design district around 30-40min later.Dont miss it :-)
120,A highlight of our Miami trip,Fun place to stroll through.  Lots of great restaurants and bars close by to check out as well. Must see attraction.
121,Well worth a visit,Such a cool place to visit. Amazing art work and area to explore. The area has been revitalized with a few shops and restaurants.
122,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"Spending Christmas at Miami, visit Wynwood Walls is a “must to do” very Interesting all the diferents expression of art !"
123,Superb day at Wynwood Walls,"Several reviews mentioned trouble parking but Google found us a couple of off street parking lots within 2 blocks where you could pay by card at the meter. Street parking needs a mobile App which is not really practical for us overseas visitors. The streets around the main show area are well worth a stroll because the street are stretches well beyond the exhibit area. The actual exhibit area itself is incredible but try to get there for opening time, which seems to vary between 10 and 11am on any given day. Once the place gets busy some of the walls are harder to view and therefore enjoy. Well worth a couple of hours to take it all in."
124,Superb day at Wynwood Walls,"Compared to when it started, Wynwood is now completely commercialized. Food and shops are super expensive because the rents are so high. It used to be cool with artists painting walls around every corner, galleries were open, people were being inspired. Now there are hazardous construction zones everywhere - BE CAREFUL MIAMI CONSTRUCTION WORKS ARE NOT LOOKING OUT FOR YOU! If it’s your first time there you may not realize the changes but if you were a Miami local who one loved this area, I’m with you. I miss the old Wynwood. None of the walls in my photos or on my blog P.S. This Rocks exist today 😢 Search “Wynwood” on my blog to see lots of amazing photos of Wynwood Walls then and now."
125,Great way to spend two hours in Miami,Amazing collection in a park where all the walls are painted by several artists. Huge works of art Many galleries all around. They also have tours if you want to get more info on The artists and the placeOutdoors
126,Must see,The walls are apparently a must see for visitors of Miami. They were really interesting and I’m glad we went to see them. They are really artistic and a must see for people that love art and pop culture. It’s a happening part of Miami with cute and trendy brunch spots and clubs on a Saturday night.
127,Colourful and amazing graffiti,"It’s a amazing place to take pictures, when I went there had a people doing a photo shot for something else"
128,Very cool! ,As a casual art lover - this is incredible to see such remarkable outdoor art.  If you find yourself in Miami - it is a must-see!
129,Great for tourist and locals ,Lance was exceptional. Had the best tour he is so knowledgeable and interesting. He brought the paintings to life. I highly recommend this tour it is truly a must see.
130,Wynwood Walls is a must-see in Miami!!!,"Very cool place Beautiful art, many restaurants, food truck parks and musicMy go to place to relax and have a good time"
131,A Mural lovers must,Amazing art work fun place to visit for free when in Miami kid friendly and nice area to walk around
132,Culture in Miami,"I usually drive around wynwood every 6 months or so, but we got lucky with parking and decided to stop. The walls were beautiful to look at. It was a short walk. I do wish they had more trees for shade or other forms of shade."
133,The Art ,"Family and I went to check it out on a weekend. It's pretty cool.Worth the hour drive. Parking is a little sketchy , but other than that , it's worth a visit."
134,Amazing,"Visiting Wynwood is something that every visitor to Miami needs to do, and visit to this urban area is incomplete without exploring the Wynwood Walls."
135,Wall art ,We went on a whim and man has it changed from when I went years ago. The art is amazing! There were a lot of people but everyone was nice. There was a gift shop and people selling ice cream there too!
136,This is a great free afternoon in Miami.,Beautiful wall paintings - free visit - incredible paintings all around the area. Very colourful and many different themes.
137,Electic,"This was on my radar but I didn’t know I would enjoy it so much! Nice setup allowing you to see all of the installations. It was educational as well. Took about an hour, all outside."
138,Great place to spend the day!,Really nice area to walk about and take in all the artwork for an hour or so. No charge to enter and plenty impressive pieces. There are also a couple of gift shops. We parked in a multi-storey lot at Target about 15 min walk away from the walls. Seemed easier than dealing with on street parking.
139,Favorite place to visit in Miami. ,This is such a cool area and so many talented people have painted murals all over the walls. It's a huge area with lots to see so definitely worth a trip. Also some indoor areas with smaller paintings and places to buy souvenirs as well.
140,Fantastic Art,"A  must when in Miami, this wall art is fantastic and one can catch the free shuttle bus and hop on and off when ever you like."
141,"formerly a rough area, now transformed into an attractive art-on-walls space",We had a really great tour of the Wynwood Walls on February 14th with Lance! The curated street art is really amazing and Lance provided excellent context and information on a number of pieces. Highly recommend seeing the walls and taking a tour. Ask for Lance!
142,Colorful in every way,We went here with friends this afternoon. The only real cost is parking if you can find it down here. I think the weekends it would be really crowded but we managed to park within a block and had a nice afternoon walking the street exhibits. Of course there are restaurants here and a lot of ways to spend money and you can also take a tour. You really don't need to take a tour though unless you want some more in-depth information. This is really upscale street art. These artists do more than just write their name on the wall. It is not a neighborhood I would wander in after night but during the day you'll have no problems.
143,Awesome Graffiti ,"I’ve never had a bad experience at Wynwood! It was just as expected. It has beautiful artwork that you can enjoy in your own pace. Each time, I’ve gone in the winter/spring and it is pleasant! It’s a must see!"
144,Great spot to visit,"The artwork is detailed and scaled up in size. Several nice ones, and they seem to change from time to time. The gift shop was pricey though. Be ready to wait patiently if you want to take photos in front of these: they are popular enough that you'll almost always have others in the frame with you :-)"
145,Must do if visiting Miami!,"You can tell when you are driving close to the Wynwood Walls as you start to see graffiti everywhere.  The actual walls are colourful and amazing to look at.  I think we would have appreciated them more if we looked at them while on a tour, so we would know what we were looking at."
146,Nice and impressing,If you travel to Miami the wynwood walls are a must. Great artwork displayed both formally and informally. A great way to spend a few hours. Don’t miss it.
147,Must-See attraction in Wynwood,"Take a lovely walk and observe many artists' work on large canvases, enter into several galleries showing some of the artists' smaller piece (and considerably pricier). It is is definitely a very attractive area, you can take a golf-cart guided tour, but discovering the area on foot is really a good way to see the art."
148,Wynwood Wall,Photography and talking to artists. This was my first time. I enjoyed it so much and came home to review the background of the famous and talented people I met. You must park and stay from morning til night. Parking was ridiculously expensive but if you drive around you can find some deals. Everyone was super nice. I will go again. Take your walking shoes. You will walk. I am over 65 but I had no problem . I would recommend bringing water and food to have so you dont have to stop!
149,Great place to visit ,Love visiting the walls every few months. Try to avoid the crowds by going early morning on a week day
150,One of the best places in Miami - definitely from an Art perspective,"As a creative and a lover of art this place was pretty cool to walk through, so many diff types of galleries, restaurants, shops, bars, a very chill place to hang for all ages could be a bit pricy depending on where you go but all and all good times."
151,"Underrated spot, worth the trip","We rode bikes over from South Beach and spent the afternoon checking out the murals/street art.  Amazing talent, colorful vibes, and lunch at Love Life is also a must-do."
152,Great art,"On our way to our favorite restaurant, is a total assault on the senses .. wall to wall art, music, great stores, young and old enjoying every minute ."
153,Waking around Wynwood walls.,Cool place to walk around and view street art.  Very packed.  I would suggest you park a few blocks up and walk because the streets are so congested.
154,Street art,"Wynwood is a must-do visit for those coming to Miami and those who LIVE in Miami.Art is everywhere in every wall, and inbetween. All the spaces that are occupied by artwork, and how each artist strives to have its art on a wall, speaks for itself. Whether the artist is paying to show his/her work or he/she is a major guest artist, one must visit this place and learn about its history."
155,Wally world,"For those looking something laid back to do, I would suggest visiting the Wynwood Walls. Very cool artwork can be found on all walls and also within the buildings.  There is no fee to visit and worth spending sometime walking through this place. Additionally, there is a phone charging station within one of the buildings if you need a quick boost of energy."
156,Great Area to walk around,"If you enjoy art, this is a must-see.  The Wynwood are buildings are painted with beautiful murals.  The Wynwood Walls is a specific enclosure with painted murals.  Fun and free to walk around."
157,Take a guided tour.,Bold. Artistic. Colorful. Creative. Amazing. And worth the trip to see!!!! Experienced it at night. Sublime.
158,Artful walls ,This place is awesome and not to be missed!! There was so much beautiful artwork to be seen and it’s totally free!
159,Wall art in a new dimension ,The entire district is a beautiful giant gallery of amazing art! Wynwood walls are exhibits from invited street artists!
160,Colorful pictures ,This was an enourmously pleasant surprise which we enjoyed immensely. All graffitis is good but some are utterly great. A must visit when in Miami
161,impressive street art,"BAsically the sourrounding seems to have been a poorer area but due to the widespread grafiti it seems to have become more a hipster area. Lots of interesting piantings in the area, nice coffee shops. Nice for a walk arround.Also some well known brands have established theier outlets their."
162,Visit to Wynwood Walls in Miami,"The area around the walls is very nice. The walls itself has beautiful murals throughout and a nice garden area. Couple of different stores to buy souvenirs and artwork. Many great restaurants nearby, just stick to the immediate area and don’t wander off too far. Stick to the strip and maybe one block west, but don’t go any further west."
163,Interesting Place!,"Take a walk to Wynwood walls as this is a very nice place in Miami, though quite different from the whole city. Nice walls, nice art, nice caffees. Worth seeing!"
164,A must see when in Miami,This exceeded our expectations. The artwork was incredible. Murals were beautiful and in many styles. Like an outdoor art museum. Free. We recommend. Set aside an hiur for this visit. Parking in area was not difficult.
165,WOW,"We went on a Thursday afternoon. The place was not packed, but there were quite a few people like us walking around, sight-seeing, and taking pictures. The murals were very original and conveyed messages beyond the obvious. Although modern art has received a lot of backlash recently, these murals are breathtaking. We loved it!!"
166,Best to see in Miami,Loved visiting and sharing this time with family walking and learning! Loved the set up and location
167,Fascinating Wall Art,Just drove around the area for 30 minutes snapping pics off some incredible works of art mixed into what looked Like abandoned warehouse. Amazing talent out there!
168,Really nice,We visited Wynwood Walls in Miami. The walls are very impressive. It attracted a huge crowd. There were a large number of restaurants and shops in the area. It was a very pleasant experience
169,Incredible street art,Mesmerizing. Worth the Lyft ride!  Wish we'd spent more time exploring the whole neighborhood.  All different artistic styles.
170,Wynwood Tour,What an amazing place. Everyone visiting Miami should come here to be inspired by the street art. I certainly was. It show cases amazing talent. It’s just such a shame that one day the next artist will spray over the previous masterpiece. Come here to be visually stimulated.
171,Curated Street Art ,"We went to Wynwood and had a look around. Saw entry to the specfic Wynwood Walls section and decided to a quick walk around the area before going in. Got the idea of the urban regeneration and the walls were a great concept. The art itself was entertaining. The Kobe tribute wall was a thoughtful touch.Whilst there it began to rain so ducked into a bar for a beer and a cocktail. Rain stopped an hour later and we decided we would go to the actual Wynwood Walls section. This was about 4pm. We get there and a sign has appeared saying that the Wynwood Walls are closed for the rest of the day AND the next 2 days. No previous signs could be seen warning of this. Spoke with someone who seemed to be associated with organising whatever event was taking place and told it had been booked out by ""some celebrities"". Anyway we only had a couple of days of our visit to MIA left so could not actually visit the specific Wynwood Walls section. But it sucks for selling out to ""some celebs""..."
172,Touring the art,"The murals are beautiful. It's a must see when in Miami. I recommend not staying only at the walls but enjoying the whole neighborhood, since there is art everywhere. There are also loads of nice food and cafes."
173,Great place with great art,"Meet Lance, he was our tour guide at Wynwood Walls, a fantastic Miami neighbourhood dedicated to street and graffiti art. I cannot recommend highly enough how good Wynwood Walls is. It hosts murals and art pieces, available to purchase from their on site shop, from the world’s best street artists. Please get a tour and if you are lucky enough, you will get the highly knowledgable and educating Lance. He has a real passion for the art and it’s history, thank you Lance !"
174,"An Excellent, Short Activity","Meet Lance, he was our tour guide at Wynwood Walls, a fantastic Miami neighbourhood dedicated to street and graffiti art. I cannot recommend highly enough how good Wynwood Walls is. It hosts murals and art pieces, available to purchase from their on site shop, from the world’s best street artists. Please get a tour and if you are lucky enough, you will get the highly knowledgable and educating Lance. He has a real passion for the art and it’s history, thank you Lance !"
175,A cool place to visit,"I liked the art exhibition on the walls, They are good panoramas to take pictures. It is really nice that the famous artists come and paint the walls."
176,Nice experience,"The overall experience is great. However, the on site store sells very overpriced items and I encountered two extremely rude sales people and their supervisor, Lara, on this one day. They tried to force me to buy something because it was poorly placed in a display and knocked to the ground. I never even touched the item. However woke this place thinks it is, the staff couldn’t wait to try to get me to hand over my wallet to them. $$$"
177,Walls interesting but beware of store,"The Wynwood Walls are worth a visit if you are in Miami.  Parking is relatively easy and they have a public garage.  The entire area is very walkable and you can find quality food and drink near the Walls.  Also, the Walls are more extensive than I expected so you are not just looking at one wall rather it is a series. The area has a very nice vibe and you can spend a day there."
178,Awesome!,"The art is so spectacular here, it's like nothing we'd seen before! I highly recommend even a short stroll here, for all ages."
179,It's just ok,This is a good place to visit and look at all the wall murals and art by different artists. Instagram pic worthy for sure.
180,Stunning!,"We just walked through the colorful, beautiful, funny, weird, inspiring murals.We also went through the museum.  All free and such a unique experience!"
181,Loved It!,The Wynwood area of Miami is definitely worth a visit and especially the Wynwood Walls street art.  We didn't do the official tour but walked around in our own time.  A really enjoyable experience and some fantastic art on display.  It's free as well !
182,Which wall will you wistfully welcome into your personal pantheon of painted pictorial presentations ?,"We were 2 couples and we went walking through the streets of Wynwood. The area is large and there are lots and lots of streets with different types of murals. You can take tours or just walk around yourselves. We walked around different streets for over 2 hours and we could have stayed longer. If you have a handicapped placard or a handicapped license plate u can park on the street for free, otherwise there is plenty of metered street parking and parking lots you pay for. We recommend to all as a wonderful place to walk around."
183,If you like art at all you must check it out,"Driving or walking, you will see more fine art on buildings in Wynwood than any other location I know of.  Don't miss this if you visit Miami."
184,Great place,"The walls are closed due to Covid, but you can still drive by and see some of them from the street. Amazing artists!"
185,Fun entertaining art,A great revolving collection of walls with curated street art from some of the worlds best contemporary artist.
186,Beautiful and amazing,"We got there when it opened at 10 and took a tour at 11am. I recommend you take the tour, but you can also just walk around and see the beautiful street art. You can buy replicates of the street art if there something you like. You can take as many pictures of the art but don't touch the art since it will ruin it. There is more to see in that area, so expect to spend several hours there."
187,Great place to visit,"Lance was very knowledgeable and friendly, he gave us a wonderful tour with terrific insight. Definitely take a tour and ask for Lance!"
188,Fantastic place and fabulous tour guide,"Time only allowed a drive by viewing coming from Miami Beach.  As we got close to the prime area, started seeing artist paintings on the walls.  I may have missed information from the web site, but I wished there was a ‘drivers map’ to the key selections to view during a drive by.  Our group of 3 were pleased with what we saw during our drive by."
189,Cool walls,Our guide Lance was terrific! Very interesting and knowledgeable and personable. Definitely worth the money!
190,Such a cool neighborhood to explore!,"No longer a hidden gem of Miami, one place you must not miss on your trip into the city! Walk around and take photos of all of the amazing art!"
191,Best Stop of the Day,Took the one hour tour. To do this without a guide would not be very enlightening. Our guide was Lance. He was great; very knowledgeable and informative with a little humour thrown in. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience!
192,Tour of Wynwood Walls with Lance,"This is a group of buildings whose walls have been decorated with colorful murals by contemporary artists.  The area is like a park of art works in the middle of Miami. It is free to the public and the said buildings are galleries, restaurants or bookstore.  Some of the artists also sell their art at those galleries. This is a very nice respite to walk through this outdoor space and a big tourist draw.  The area outside the Walls has many other buildings decorated in artwork. It also has many other shops and eateries. This should be a stop for any visitor to Miami. A great photo op!!!"
193,Easy breezy afternoon!,"If you are coming to Miami, you have to hit Wynwood, and the wynwood walls.  Just a cool, relaxed vibe. Restaurants are good. Stores are cool. My favorite place to walk around and soak in the day."
194,Awesome Street Art,You have to visit this place as they having amazing artwork there and it's nice to walk around and see all the details that these artists put into their paintings.
195,Tour of Winwood Walls with Lance,One of those things I’ve always wanted to do and finally did. Such a cool experience! Absolutely beautiful. A must-see if you’re in Miami or close by. Can’t wait to go again!
196,Great place for street art,"This is a fascinating place to visit, with constantly changing mural art by local and international artists.  And the surrounding area is equally full of design shops and cafes.  While we were there (the week before Superbowl LIV) we saw a fresh mural being painted on the street for the forthcoming game.  Definitely a place worth visiting in Miami."
197,First visit to Miami and Wynwood walls,"After a cruise and Before Super Bowl 2020, I experienced this beautiful display of art that I have ever seen!!!! Any and all types of art is displayed and some murals change very quickly. Nonetheless, I enjoyed viewing the various displays and looking forward to visiting again and again!!!!"
198,Beautiful artwork,"Awesome place to visit. Colorful street murals. Art Galleries. Gourmet coffee. A truly museum of the streets. Great spot to take selfies and pics. If you love graffitis you must go, if you don't love graffitis you must go. You could change your mind about it."
199,Nice indoor & outdoor art exhibit!,"Sunday morning is a great time to visit-can easily walk thru and catch a golf cart tour thru the 20+blocks of amazing street art and miss the larger crowds. The murals are largely unobscured by trucks and cars and the tour guides are fantastic -much better than touring alone as you’ll miss remarkable stories and nuance.  If anyone is disabled and needs to sit within the garden/walls, there are low benches and rocks to perch for a spell."
200,Walk through Wynwood Walls,Walk the neighborhood - not just the walls. The walls do not open until 10:30 so spend some time around the neighborhood to experience the local street art outside.
201,Great art for free±,You can not imagine how artistic it was! The place is full of graffitis and each of them was amazing! You can take lots of colorful photos for your social medias😬 It’s a bit crowded but thats fine;)
202,Art,Lance was very knowledgeable and a great guide. He knew many of the wall artists. Highly recommended.
203,Walk about Art,This was a great place to visit and it was free of charge all day everyday. Capture great pictures of the artists work.
204,A must see!,"We had a guided tour of Wynwood Walls with Lance pn January 23, 2020.  He was by far the best tour guide I ever had in the entire world. He brought the wall art yo life!  He revealed the history of wall art and the history of the artists represented on the walls. He knew the backgrounds of the artists and the techniques they used.  He is very smart and an eloquent speaker.  Don't visit this place without a tour from Lance!!!"
205,A Lesson in Art Appreciation ,Lance was an awesome tour guide. The hour long Anything elsetour covered the history of Wynwood Walls and talked about the current street art on display. Highly recommend this tour. Made the experience much more meaningful.
206,A must visit ,It was thanksgiving so we couldn’t enter the gated area as it was closed but there is lots of street art in the area outside Highly recommended If we are ever in the area again we will definitely return
207,Worth the time,"We didn't have an opportunity to do a tour with a guide, but wish we had.  Although walking through on our own was beautiful and I think we got some of what the artists were trying to say, I wish we'd been able to get more insight on how some of the paintings came to be.  This is one of those spots where we could spend an hour or 3 hours looking at the art and taking it all in, but if you only have a short amount of time, don't skip over this spot.  it's worth whatever time you can give it."
208,A Must visit,"A landmark place to visit for sure, if you are into modern art. We were there on a Sunday and it was very busy, but the displays are large enough for evevryone to get a good view. Well worth going if you are visiting Miami."
209,A beautiful piece of Art.,Be sure to take the tour to get an in-depth understanding.  Lance's passion was obvious and he passed it on to us!
210,Awesome neighborhood and tour,"it was very interesting to look at those arts. There is a big parking garage nearby, and there are a lot of restaurants and shops in the area. We got there around 5 pm, so we got to see those arts in the day light. When it got dark, the arts were lit up with light behind arts, looked better in my opinion."
211,Open air art exhibition,"Go there! Just go there! And be enriched, amazed, surprised - and leave with a smile on your face. Don't visit Miami without a trip to this neighborhood - it contains not one or two or ten great mural paintings, but a wonderful abundance of colorful play!"
212,Tour of Wynnwood Walls,The walls are ever changing and interesting. It feels like you can walk forever and really enjoy the work of a wide variety of artists. Plenty of places in the area to enjoy lunch when you are done.
213,Perfect for a first experience,"If you appreciate Arts and like Art, this is the place. A wonderful place to spend an afternoon. Loved the art works and talented artists."
214,"Beautiful, creative and free entry!","The Wynwood Walls is a perfect destination for an afternoon activity.  The art is spectacular and as some of it changes ever year, every visit is unique.The area is filled with fun restaurants and shops.Parking can be a bit of a challenge but with a little patience you can find a spot."
215,Great morning walk,Brilliant experience in seeing how artists have had the room and time to explore and develop their skills. In many senses like the San Francisco hippie-ness but in a more controlled manner.Worth to see if you are in MIami!
216,Impressive,"Take plenty of time to walk around and enjoy the walls of art and imagination. You won’t regret it!  There is something for everyone including young and old, those into art and those who aren’t!"
217,Colourful and interesting,"Take if from a Miami native, this place and the surrounding neighborhood is the new ""must do"" when you visit Miami. And even if you're a local, you can't miss this place and the eclectic bohemian neighborhood it resides in. The Wynwood Walls should be seen as part of a date and a take on contemporary street art by some pretty visionary and talented artists. My wife and I had ""heard"" about the place but weren't sure where it was when we parked along one of the side streets in Wynwood. We were just window shopping and figuring out which restaurant we were going to eat at when we saw the entrance. The place is well worth entering and seeing. Don't forget to go the whole way through and eventually end up at the ice cream truck at the end - which was very welcome after having walked the Walls in the afternoon. Definitely a must see if you visit Miami and the ""two-fer"" is a bonus in walking around one of Miami's burgeoning neighborhoods with tons of food fare and shops around."
218,‘Always a Blast’,Loved walking with the family enjoying amazing art! Very well set up and anyone can enjoy this art together!
219,Brilliant area,"I've been in the area twice. If you're into Graffiti and art, I highly reccomend checking this area out. The reason I say area is you have the main building for Wynwood walls, but you'll need to walk the surrounding streets or drive to see all the amazing Graffiti."
220,Quick visit to Wynwood walls,This was a great time.  Walking around the official Wynwood Walls and surrounding area was great.  Even in a light rain.  Plenty of places to see past art.  And the neighborhood has many craft breweries and tap rooms.  Great stops out of the rain for a few beers just enhanced the experience.
221,Wonderful and creative,"Incredible experience! So much artistic talent in one place.  Tip 1: I would encourage a guided tour if you don't know the history of Wynwood walls, this kind of art, or the artists. We chose a food and art tour. A bit pricier than others($69), but I was not disappointed. It was by far the best tour I've ever had. Gina, our tour guide was wonderfully informative and fun. So much information was given that I was able to gain a further appreciation behind the individual pieces, artists, and culinary choices at Wynwood Walls. A couple extra tips: Allow yourself a good amount of time, several hours, if you enjoy looking at art. We could have spent an entire day here instead of the 3 hours we allowed. Walk outside of just the main area. There are murals and art pieces blocks out from the gallery and main attraction area, just be safe and aware of your surroundings.... as always."
222,Wynwood Walls,"The Wyndward Walls are an excellent diversion on which one can spend a few, quality hours. It won't take up a large chunk of your day, unless you really want to take your time here.The art is excellent, across the board. And while there are plenty of exhibits outdoors, there are also indoor exhibits where you can get a bit of air conditioning on a hot day."
223,Crowded site of selfie takers,I had heard about Wynwood Walls but this blew away my expectations and I don't consider myself an art connoisseur by any means. It's free of charge and there are multiple city blocks covered with amazing works of art by so many different talented artists. Grab a bite before/after or get a coffee to walk through. It's well worth it. You can book an official tour as well or just mosey through and see the murals at your own pace (that's what we did). Great for the whole family! Set aside an 1-2 hours if you want to see them all and not be rushed.
224,Very Colorful Indeed!!,We come to Miami at least once per year and always visit the Wynwood Walls/Wynwood area. The artwork changes regularly so there is always something new to see each visit.
225,An absolute Muat,In a town which is light on cultural attractions this is a nice place to spend a couple of hours and soak up the artwork.
226,Dinner,This was definitely an unusual kind of tour for our family with teens however they seem to very much enjoy looking at all of the different murals and the experience of the neighborhood. The artwork was very impressive we spent approximately an hour which I think is the right amount of time for us
227,Must See,"What a fun area! We loved wandering around and seeing all the art, enjoying the cafes and breweries, and appreciating all the talent that has gone into creating this area. Definitely worth a visit- don’t forget your camera and fun clothes to pose with the art though!"
228,Amazing place and great tour by Lance.,"I  am not  a fan of  graffiti, but accept that  others may  find it of interest. Very  colorful . Nice  walk in the  sunshine . Free  entry ."
229,Do yourself a favor!,"Interesting display of street art.  We spent about an hour walking around the main exhibit area and also some of the surrounding side streets.A little disappointed there were no t-shirts for sale with examples of individual art work on them, all we saw were black ones with just the WW logo.Well worth stopping by."
230,Best tour guide Lance Durham,"We visited today and had Lance for our tour guide. Because he provided background information on the artists we were more able to appreciate and understand the various works, particularly Ron English’s mural. The hour long tour also included the origins of Wynwood Walls and the history of wall art. Thanks Lance, we really enjoyed our visit!"
231,Another Major Street Gallery in Miami,"So glad we came to visit the Wynwood Walls.  The artwork is amazing, creative and unique.  It is so impressive to see a 3 story building fully painted.  All the businesses in and around the Wynwood Walls are also painted.  You can wander around there for hours and still not see all of them."
232,Great ,"We stopped here on our via the Big Bus on our way to Little Havana for a food tour....got there before they opened, so walked the neighborhood.  Wonderful cafes for breakfast and I think more craft breweries and other novel eateries are popping up in the neighborhood.  We just walked around by ourselves, but I bet a tour would be interesting next time!  The artwork here is lovely....and sooooo colorful!"
233,Unique place not to be missed,"This was a surprising place to check; we've heard before about the transformation of Wynwood and Design District in Midtown Miami, and my wife visited the place some years ago with artistic friends who worked in the neighborhood, but still it was a refreshing surprise, and we will definitely visit again when we return to Miami.It was raining earlier and with also with the Covid-19 situation you didn't see many people in the steets, however, the atmosphere was good and the small cafes and restaurants were inviting; having eaten already we just went for a coffee, which we got  at Walt Grace Vintage flanked by nicely restored cars and an awesome collection of guitars; the bread at Zak the Baker must be very good since there was a line of people patiently waiting their turn; yet the main magnet here is the big murals and art everywhere – hey, even a WeWork building is wrapped in art!"
234,Give Yourself Time to Just Be Here,The experience falls someplace between my generation and the one of my son but it is amazing to see the old neighbourhood being transferred to fashionalbe artistic district while already making a great attraction. That is an experience!
235,Great tour with an amazing guide!,"A deserted factory district has become an oasis for visual talents. Abandoned factories were whitewashed which provided easels for  expressions  on a grand scale. One can spend many hours wandering the area reveling in the sights and creations of the new  Miami art culture. Shops and galleries have been born, and I believe this is only the beginning of what will be a major center for visual arts.DO GO, you'll never forget the experience."
236,Surrounded by color and stories,"What a fantastic place.  Of course, there is equally stunning street art all over the Wynwood area, but Wynwood Walls showcases some jaw-dropping highlights.  Entrance is free, too.  For me, Wynwood Walls and the surrounding neighbourhood was the highlight of Miami."
237,i made the ride  by my own,"We visited Wynwood Walls and decided to take a tour. Since it was only 50 minutes long and reasonably priced at $20 per person, it seemed worth it. We got more than what we expected. Our tour guide, Lance, was knowledgeable, interesting and immersed us in information about street art. We were able to dig deeper while admiring the art, we got so much more from it than if we viewed it on our own.Great experience."
238,Art as you have never and will never see it anywhere else. ,Enjoyed our visit.  Very nice.  So very interesting.  Be sure to stop in at the galleries - so very good!
239,Amazing ,We had a wonderful afternoon strolling around the walls and surrounding areas - soaking up the art and sunshine.It far outweighed our expectations - we will be back when we are next in Miami Paula & Darren
240,Wynwood Walls were AMAZING to see in person!,"Enjoyed every moment of our visit to the gallery. The art is phenomenal - and the experience was enriched incredibly by the way Lance (our tour guide) told the story of the art itself, the history of street art, and the importance of this form of expression as a way to impact our society and our culture. Visit Wynwood Walls...and definitely walk the tour with Lance! Thank you, Lance!!"
241,Great Art,Visited the Walls as part of a cruise excursion.  Our guide gave us some information on the history and let us roam around.  Recommend this site highly.
242,Incredible Art - Wonderful Tour Guide,"Highly recommend taking the tour.  Lance was our guide and he did an amazing job. He is very knowledgeable and passionate, and gave us some behind the scenes - like how long certain street art took to take on, some of the personalities of the artists.  We got somewhat lucky in that we were the only people who signed up for the tour during this time slot, and we had two kids, 7 and 10, so Lance did a terrific job customizing the tour to be interesting and relevant to the kids.   Thank you, Lance!"
243,Wynwood tour,"We stopped here to view the art after brunch in a nearby eatery. The colors are stunning and the artwork is very interesting. Great to spend an afternoon or evening here, enjoying these displays along with a great meal.  Highly recommended!!"
244,Good vibes great for photos ,"Great way to spend an hour or so - walk around the neighborhood, see the murals, and then grab some food."
245,Fab little place,We only had an hour to visit as we were unable to find a free parking for our car. Very nice place to visit on a sunny day with a good selection of restaurants . Lots of artistic walls to take many cool picture. Teens would enjoy it.
246,Great art in a vibrant little park,"I went to Wynwood for research purposes, I'm an art historian with a focus on street art. Wynwood is known for its art scene, and I knew I should take the Wynwood Walls tour, if just to get some knowledge of how the place worked.Best decision I've made this trip. Lance, the tour guide, was incredibly informative and helpful. He provided personal stories of artists and gave behind-the-scenes information to us on the tour. After the tour of Wynwood Walls, he showed me around the neighborhood, told me about the artists and works from Art Basel, and introduced me to the curator of the new Museum of Graffiti (another place you should visit if in the area).I can't recommend Lance enough. I got so much out this tour, it really helped me in my research and it was a joy to meet him."
247,Late night trip to see Wynwood Walls ,I love visiting Wynwood.  The art is amazing and very eclectic. I have been several times and I would love to go whenever I visit Miami. Since the art is a lot of graffiti kids and teens also enjoy viewing the outdoor artwork even more than an art museum.
248,Great street art,"Wonderful walk through the walls and surrounding area. Followed an app to get there which took us through an area with a lot of homeless people; no one bothered us but was unexpected. Nice wee food market and some stalls close by. Saw people drinking Bills Lemonade which is a favourite of ours (can’t get it at home) but unfortunately it wasn’t actually Bills, just the cups."
249,Family and friends trip,"Lance was great and was very knowledgeable. His insights provided great context to the walls. In my opinion, the best way to visit for first timers!"
250,Nice to Drive thru,"This is one of the top attractions to visit in Miami. Wynwood Walls is a fenced area (but open air) in the revitalized neighborhood of Wynwood. Within the area, one can see graffitis from famous artists, like the Brazilian Eduardo Kobra, in large walls. There are also some art galleries with paintings and scultures to sell. A must see in Miami and indeed one of the top attractions ranked on TripAdvisor.In the surrounding are of the place (in the neighborhood), there are also many graffitis in the streets' walls, building façades, etc. One should also look at those. There are several restaurants, bars and cafes around the area. You can spend the whole day if you want to. Highly recommended!"
251,Interesting location with street art,"I was hesitating if even to go here, as I saw many such across South America and Europe. But being TA 1 in Miami tickled me, so decided to go. What a mistake I'd made if we didn't come!!!The hardest was to find parking on a hot sunny Jan day.From the moment we entered I was blown away with amazing street and modern art. Even my kids (teens), who are not art fans and argued all the way, liked it very much.Just few words on place history: this was a low class neighborhood with small businesses and abandoned warehouses, a Miami area you don't want to visit with a high crime rate. Mr. Goldman, entrepreneur, investment building contractor and a visionary bought this land and gave it for free for many international artists to express themselves and have their opportunity. This art heaven is what they made.The place consists of six ex warehouses, whose exteriors serve as giant canvases for extrodinary huge murals, while the interior is full of art pieces: paintings, art sculpture masterpieces, artistic every day objects, etc....which are sold at 3 to 6 figures price tags.The place is totally free to enter, you can take pics and do count on 2-3 hrs for visit.Many hip cafes and restaurants around."
252,Wynwood walls,"It feels nice walk around such a beautiful art in our beautiful Miami!!I felt proud and delighted with every single one we saw. The entrance was free.My kids loved the paintings and the experience as much as I did.We walked through, sat down while admiring the art walls and took so many pictures.Public parking available around the area and a vast amount of nice restaurants to make the experience complete."
253,Beautiful walls,I found this very interesting. I walked around for a few hours and took tons of photographs.  I didn't do an official tour but I plan on coming back when I have more time to do that. The wall mural art goes for many blocks and is beautiful and fascinating.
254,Incredible street art and overall experience!,"This was part of a bus tour around Miami. It is so amazing to see the works of art adorning the walls and buildings. I enjoyed this so much, would love to do it again."
255,Good Art Vibes,"In December of 2019, I took in an official private tour with Lance, a doscent at Wynwood Walls, and it was the most remarkable art experience I had in 2019.  For a little context: I have a terminal masters degree in theater directing, and so have some interest in art, and nothing in the previous year (or this one) has yet to come close to my tour with Lance in Miami. For further context: I now create tours for a living. This was a Very Very good one.Lance's knowledge is incredible, but it's his nuanced understanding and love for the form that is beyond striking. I expected a quick spin around some dope murals with a bit of context thrown in, but by the end I was an absolute emotional mess--gloriously so. An incredible moving time with him, and I've recommended him, and taking the tour in general, to, literally, everyone I know who's off to Miami. I'm hoping Miami will be a biannual stop before visiting my family for the holidays, and I'm looking forward to seeing Lance as often as possible: it's worth it. Go Now."
256,Really Cool! And Free!,"First time going here with my daughter was an experience to behold. As a lover of art and seeing the many different ways we interpret it, so I highly recommend this. Not only do I enjoy the art but people watching and seeing the types of people and what they enjoy, sometimes engaging too. The surrounding walls going into Wynwood Walls are also surrounded with many beautiful pieces of art expressing political, religious and many others points of interest. Been here multiple times and when someone comes down to visit I always recommend."
257,Wynwood Walls,"This is the place for inspiration and awe. You will find creativity at it's best and a place to rest mentally, physically and emotionally. An excellent addition to Miami."
258,Beautiful Wall murals,We booked a tour and were shown around the various pieces of art by Lance. We were told about the origins and given insight into how the artists work in different ways. A lovely way to spend some time in Miami
259,Incredible art on walls ,"A couple different people recommended we check out this area. It was kind of neat for a minute, but extremely underwhelming. There are not that many shops. And the walls area was extremely small"
260,Wow!,Free to enter. Great paintings depicting the culture and history. Tours available but also good to wander round solo.
261,cool environment,"We went for a Nice Drive in Wynwood, since it was sunday was kind of full. We just pass by and saw some beautiful paints. You Also can park and walk around. There are à frente Restaurants and We saw some food trucks also."
262,What A Great Idea,"Our tour was great! Lance, our guide, enhanced our experience through his passion and knowledge. He gave us a wealth of information and answered every question. We highly recommend this tour!"
263,Truly exceptional art on these walls.,This review is long overdue. We visited Wynwood Walls on a short trip to Miami. We loved taking pictures of the various pieces of art. Each piece had a unique theme and incredibly great use of colors. These pieces require a lot talent considering the dimensions of the pieces. I would love to return and see what new pieces have been made.
264,Stunning murals,The area where Wynwood Walls is located has something for everyone. After having a good brunch or lunch in one of the many spots around then you could go to take nice pictures in this artistic heaven.
265,Fun and entertaining,"We were celebrating my friends birthday when we decided to check out this place. It was interesting, intriguing and we enjoyed it."
266,Miami Wynwood Walls and street art,This was a pleasant surprise.  The artwork was interesting and the wall displays were more extensive than I anticipated.
267,Insipring,I brought a 14 years old girl and we both enjoyed the tour very much!  Our guide gave us very valuable information.
268,Amazing Artwork,"Despite many visits to Miami, I'd passed this by on grounds that I'm not a fan of grafitti, some comments about the area, etc.  Mistake.  The walls complex Is art, the galleries Are interesting and the neighborhood Is fun - well worth 2 hours or so wander.  There's a lot to see, not just within the Walls exhibit itself, but in the surrounding neighborhood; packed with tourists, but enough local flavor.  Many dining and drinking options, though shopping outside of the Levis pop-up (wow), is more of the smoke shop variety.  On a weekend afternoon, it's moved beyond 'transitional' - you can widen the circle for parking to the point where it's reasonably available and still feel comfortable.  Really a neat place for a sunny, moderate, afternoon.  At peak heat though you might confine the tour to the Walls exhibit itself, the area is not particularly shaded."
269,Casual art experience,"We did a self-guided tour of the Wynwood  Walls as there were no community guides on that day. The walls feature monumental works by artists from all over the world. There are also several galleries within the area displaying smaller examples of various artists’ work. Surrounding the official exhibit area are several more blocks of wall art and galleries, nightclubs and restaurants, making it a very lively district. I would recommend taking a tour unless you are familiar with the street artist world; much of the work is political or protest art that could use interpretation."
270,Beautiful Art,Taking a tour with Lance Durham at Wynwood walls was one of the best things I did with my family in Miami.
271,Fascinating stop for a visit,This place will pleasantly amaze you and open your eyes to outdoor art.  I highly recommend the tour--it puts things in perspective.
272,Great and Eye Opening Tour,"The tour at Wynwood Walls was a great experience! The tour guide provides information on the evolution of street art and background information on specific artists and murals. The artwork is fantastic on its own, but understanding the artists background really gave context to the artwork. A must see if in Miami."
273,Miami's transformation in Art,I hopped off the bus and was completely gobsmacked by the area.  The walls were amazing.  I would challenge you to have a favorite one.  They are so diverse and have a international feel to them.  There are great restaurants in the area and tons of murals on many of the buildings.
274,Art actually on the streets,it was great to experience the art district of Miami.  I loved that it was so spread out and outdoors.  The flow of the displays were great and wonderful to see.
275,Wynwood Wall 50 minute guided tour,Beautiful graffiti area. Many streets with many graffitis walls around. You will not but you camera down of taking photos. You might spend 2 to 3 hours so take your time & enjoy.
276,unique open art,Murals by local artists that are beyond talented. Free admission (though you can pay for a tour if you like to be more structured) and if you go during the week it's not as busy. Found free parking on the street a few blocks away and walked. Murals and paintings are inside a small building too.  Beware of the Instagram influencer wannabes but if you can get a pic of the art itself it's great. Murals change yearly to give other artists an opportunity to feature their talent. Would go again.
277,All about arts!,We enjoyed seeing the colorful walls! There are also many restaurants and shops within walking distance. It is certainly well worth a visit.
278,Worth the visit,"I had no prior knowledge of street art, and this one-hour official tour (turned out to be a private tour on my day!) with Lance was a remarkable experience. He introduced me to the most famous artists, and highlighted the deep thinking and social movements behind the art. I learned to appreciate the beauty and power of street art after this wonderful one hour with Lance -- a very knowledgeable, passionate, and engaging tour guide. High recommend!"
279,Attraction in making,This area is definitely worth a visit.The murals are impressive and beautiful. You can spend quite some time just walking around the area.
280,Very enjoyable,Well worth the visit We spent about 2 hours walking around & purchased some items from the shop it was very enjoyable  & people were at work when we were there which was exciting to see how these pictures come to life
281,Beautiful murals,"The vibrant colors on the walls are stunning. It is wonderful that this is free and open to the public, allowing anyone to go through to see the magnificent artwork. It is not what I expected, and the walls are stunning. A visitor or local should not miss seeing this open air exhibit."
282,Unique experience mixing art and culture ,Would definitely recommend a guided tour of this wonderful area as there is so much  to see which you would never see on foot unless you spent the whole day. An incredible example of how an area can be transformed for the better.
283,Amazing,"We had the opportunity to visit Winwood Walls on January 15th and had a wonderful tour of the murals with Lance.  He is incredible.  He knows the artists and their ""back"" stories, techniques used, materials used, length of time to make the murals and general art information.  He is a font of information.  It does cost to do this tour but it is well worth it.  I can't imagine the experience being any where near as meaningful if we had just strolled through.  I now have a much greater appreciation for this street art."
284,One of the best places to visit on Miami,"The Wynwood Walls are impressive in their origin and their scope. The artwork is outstanding and carries with interesting information about the artists. If visiting this site, please opt for a tour which will explain their short history, process and artists. Lance was a delightful and knowledgeable guide for our group."
285,Great street art neighborhood.  ,This is a must for anyone visiting Miami. Whether you're interested in art or not you will appreciate the masterpieces there and come to love it. I visited this place as one of the major stops on my 'hopon/hopoff' tours.
286,An artist paradise ,We actually stumbled up on the Wynwood walls by accident on our way to a restaurant.  We went at dusk and the lighting was amazing and the artwork incredible.  Fully recommend.
287,Fun walk around,"At the heart of this area is the Wynwood walls, a collection of murals, paintings and sculptures which is free to view. Im not an art fan normally but the walls themselves, and the work on the public streets leading to the walls ranged from striking to positively weird. It was well worth the trip to the area and I recommend a visit to it."
288,"Always a great place to visit: walk, see art works, grab a bite and a drink","Our daughter bought us a private tour of for my b-day while we were on vacation in Miami. We had heard people raving about this unusual outdoor street art enclave but our visit today exceeded all expectations. Our tour guide, Lance, a New York city transplant, made the experience all the more fascinating and memorable with his intimate knowledge of the founder, the artists, their work and personal life stories. The collection is the largest and most diverse of its kind worldwide. Do not miss this unique experience if you have the opportunity. And be sure to hire Lance - and say hi from us."
289,Wynwood Walls...to walls,I would highly recommend seeing all of the beautiful art. It was awesome seeing all of the murals up close and personal.
290,Walking with the Art,"I highly recommend coming to Wynwood Walls and especially taking the guided tour. It’s informative and educational. It will give you a new found respect and appreciation for the artist and meaning behind the street art. If you can get Lance as your tour guide, do it!!! He’s super passionate and knowledgeable about the history, art and artists. The tour definitely changed my experience on our visit to Wynwood Walls."
291,A hidden (yet not so hidden) gem...& it’s FREE,We enjoyed a self-guided tour around Wynward Walls but also the surrounding streets. There were some lovely shops around this area ... worth visiting.
292,Wynwood Walls,We stopped over in Miami for our cruise and we decided to check out Wynwood Wall. I was very impressed with the murals and diversity of people. I highly recommend visiting!
293,Superb display of street art,If you are going to see the specific Wynwood Walls exhibit (free) then make sure to check their operating hours. If you have a car or willing to stroll around the area then do it!!!!!  The area is open 24 hours and hundreds of walls to view!  Just amazing transformation!!!!We totally loved the area.
294,Colorful and interesting,My wife and I visited Wynwood Walls in January 2020.  We were so impressed with the quality and originality of the art.  The art is on huge walls and up the sides of large buildings.  The whole area is inundated with art and fine restaurants and entertainment.  The center of the attraction is in the park called Wynwood Walls.  A newbie might not realize they should go to the park.  Parking is readily available near the park for a reasonable price.  There is no cost to enter the park.  There are also art galleries adjoining the park.  We visited in the daytime and we felt very safe.  I highly recommend a visit to Wynwood Walls.  We are over 70 years old and saw a genre of art that was  totally different for us and totally enjoyable.
295,great tour to explore artists/thinkers,"My family of 3, including our teenage daughter, recently had the pleasure of taking an official tour of Wynwood with Lance.  We are SO GLAD we did.  Although you can walk around Wynwood by yourself at no charge, I would highly recommend that you take this tour.  At $20 per adult, it is a steal.  Lance really made us understand the importance of Wynwood Walls and the motivation behind the creation of Wynwood Walls and the development in the area.  Through the tour, we learned how the art is selected, who the artists are and what it has done for the community.  Lance also explained how graffiti has evolved into wall art over the years and how it has made art accessible to people who would not be comfortable in traditional galleries.  We also were lucky enough to meet a local Miami artist completing an art installation in one of the shops.  Thanks to Lance for a great afternoon, your enthusiasm is contagious."
296,Must Visit,"This was such a cool place to visit in Miami before our dinner in Wynwood. We had originally hesitated about visiting just before sunset because we were worried it wouldn't feel safe for two women to walk around this area at night. We were told by locals to just stay with the crowds and in the well-lit areas of Wynwood (common sense, really) and it didn't feel sketchy at all. We loved exploring this part of the city!"
297,Self Guided night walk,"Even if you are not passionate for arts or grafitti, give the Wynwood Walls a chance. Access is free of charge, the painted walls display outstanding works of art and you can see the murals at your own pace. Book at least an hour of your time to visit the place."
298,Must see,"Our tour guide, Lance, brought the art of Wynwood Walls to life in a highly engaging and informative tour."
299,Great Tour,You will definitely want to take time to go visit this area. We enjoyed an afternoon taking in the wall art within the Wynwood Wall area and then walking around for several blocks to see the street art in the area. On the recommendation of another person’s review we walked a couple of blocks to the Salty Donut for a gourmet donut and coffee. Treat yourself! So worth it!
