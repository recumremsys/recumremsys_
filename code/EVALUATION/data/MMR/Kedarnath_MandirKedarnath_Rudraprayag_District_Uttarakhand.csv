0,Experience of Kedarnath Temple,We were 02 people and this was my first time visiting Shree Kedarnath Temple as on Oct 2019. It was a very great experience for me to visit such a sacred place.I did a trek on foot on both sides. It was very tiring trekking from Gaurikund to Temple but after looking at the view of Temple Campus I feel relax.These are very beautiful places of Lord Shiva.I would like to go again there and definitely will go.
1,Divine Touch,"My trip on 5th june 2019 was the 5th attempt at going to kedarnath temple. My wife & I flew into to Dehradun  and stayed at Paramarth ashram at Rishikesh on banks of ganges, beautiful location.The room at ashram was AC & functional, meal at canteen as per choice.Next morning by car to Guptakashi, 9 hrs drive through mostly terrible roads, backbreaking and dusty(road repair) thru magnificent scenery.Stayed at Himalayan comfort,at too high a price for the bare amenities.Next day by helicopter to & fro same day. Very hot weather all through except at Guptakashi. Extreme rush at temple. Considering our heart felt desire for long to complete the 12 Jyotirlingams, this was a happy culmination of that wish.The scenery around the temple of the mountains with some parts covered with snow was a worthy sight.Bought some prasad to take home, took many pictures of the scene, and went back to helibase for return. Contrary to general apprehension of the weather suddenly turning bad for helicopter movement, on the day of our visit it was very bright sunshine the whole day for all onward and return heli trips. On the onward journey by heli the setup was organised well and there was a system. The return from Kedar helibase was quite confusing with no one telling us to register again at the respective aviation company tent. There was a guy at the helipad who was registering for return as we landed, who was not the guy who looked after the return. No announcements of what to do. After you register for return at the right place, they will call out all around the rest places at the helibase. Till then no prior info of when one can expect to take off unless you chase the guys for info. At the Kedar helibase as it was becoming evening, the temperature began to drop and everyone had to use heavy woolens and windcheaters etc After landing back at starting helipad, back again by car all the way back thru same roads with a overnight halts at a place called Srinagar and then at Dehradun, before flying to Bombay."
2,Jai Kedarnath,I have visited Kedarnath temple this year on 09/05/2016 on Kapat opening day. The atmosphere was tremendous. Total no of people came for darshan on very first day was about 10-12 thousand. The temple was decorated with marigold flowers and Vedic Mantra was chanting. It is great place to visit for every Indian. Even after 2013 disaster the Govt has taken a lot of efforts to make yatra comfortable for the pilgrimages. The new road is constructed till the temple however we can see many houses are yet to rebuilt. in such a bad weather condition the effort to make a roads and other things including food and accommodation available is great effort by Govt and Indian ARMY.
3,Devine,"I was there in Kedarnath on 21 May along with my wife. This is a must visit temple for Hindus, and the roads nowadays are very good, though a few places on high mountains, the road trip does appear scary. We started from Bangalore on 19 May Jet airways flight at 5.45pm, reached New Delhi at 9pm, took a prepaid taxi to New Delhi Rly Station and reached there well in time for our Nanda Devi AC express to start at 11.50pm to reach Haridwar at 4.30am. We had booked taxi from a local taxi operator (Gangotri Travels) in advance, and had asked him to pick us up at 5.30am, but due to a landslide near Badrinath previous evening, he could not get us Innova as booked by us, instead gave us Dezire at 8am. It was 10 hours journey through mountains and we reached Rampur at 6pm where we stayed in a hotel arranged by Gangotri Travels. On the way around 3pm, we could take our biometric visitors card at a place called Agastyamuni. This card is important, because the Helicopter company will insist on our personal ID such as Aadhar, etc and this biometric card. Medical examination is not a must but they only advise the pilgrims beyond 55 to have one in our own interest. Next day morning, we started for Sitapur Helipad at 5am, reached the helipad at 5.30am, and were able to get the second trip of this helicopter company (Global) at 7.10am. Reached Kedarnath at 7.20am. Since we had taken a special darshan ticket (cost Rs 2100) at the helipad itself, we could complete the darshan of Lord well before 8.30am, the time given by Global to report back for return trip. However, they could take us back only at 12 noon as they take lot of breaks. Once in Sitapur/Rampur, we started our next leg of the tour to Joshimath around 12.30pm, and could reach Joshimath only at 8pm. The cab drive from Rampur/Guptakashi to Joshimath via Ukhimath is a wonderful sight to see around. Rest of our trip is given under Badrinath. Briefly: Day 1 - Reached Haridwar Rly Stn, started to Rampur via Rudraprayag/Agasthyamuni/Guptakashi and reached Rampur. Stay at Hotel Kedar Palace.Day 2 - Started to Sitapur Helipad at 5am, reached there at 5.30am, took Global helicopter (we had booked the tickets one month in advance from Gangotri Travels) at 7.20am, reached back after Darshan by 12 noon at Sitapur, started for Joshimath, reached at 8pm. Stay at Hotel (New Kamet booked by me through Yatra.com).Day 3 - Started at 9am to Badrinath, reached  Hotel Krishna Palance (booked by Gangotri) at 11.30am, luckily got darshan through queue at 2pm, booked tickets for special darshan that evening and also next day morning.Day 4 - Darshan in the morning and started for Rudraprayag at 11am. Stay at Hotel Mandakini (booked by me through Yatra.com).Day 5 - Started from Rudraprayag at 9am, and covered Lakshnan Jula, Ram Jula, Gita Mandir in Rishikesh, and Har ki pauri/Ganga Aarti at Haridwar, and got dropped at Rly Stn at 9pm."
4,Natural,"I visited Kedarnath temple during June 2019 with my family.. We started from Dehradun airport by road..Dehradun to Sonprayag..There are plenty of construction sites on the way..widening of roads are happening..hence traffic jam due to bad roads was very common problem.. Tourist rush was also high..we took overnight break at Rudraprayag and started next day morning to Sonprayag.. Due to traffic jam, we had to leave our car at Sitapur.. walked down about a kilometre to reach sonprayag.. I already took online entry permit for Kedarnath..Hence, i did not have to stand in a long queue for permit.. we crossed checkpost of Sonprayag and took shared jeep to Gaurikund.. it was 20 to 25 mins ride..we reached gaurikund by 1.30 pm.. we purchased sticks from thete and started hiking..MAJOR PROBLEM IN HIKING WAS PONIES..Their excreta and poor handling by their owners leading to lots of difficulties for climbers.. By late evening, we reached to Limcholi..we stayed in gmvn cottage at night which was very poorly managed..Next day morning, we reached kedarnath.. total 8 hours of hike..day time was hot, evenings are very cild..it can rain any time..all those stuff needs to be with you..i strongly suggest to keep one pitthu, so that you can keep your backpacks on it..otherwise back will hurt badly.. we stood 7 hours in a queue for Darshan.. Whole hiking and temple views were very beautiful..Maggy and tea are available throughout the route.. temple management is extremly poor.. lots of people used to enter without standing in a queue..Place is fantastic with scenic route, but ponies and poor management make it really tough..there should be completely separate trek for ponies.."
5,KEDARNATH DHAM a temple in lap of Himalayas,I visited kedarnathji temple with family on 30 th May 2018. It is one of the most beautiful and properly managed temple with nice structure. Temple construction is very beautiful and elegantly  designed with ancient idols. The Darshan of kedarnathji  temple is not only satisfying but also of divine nature.
6,"SHUBHA YATRA HOLIDAYS PVT.LTD, A TRAVEL CO. OF RISHIKESH",the recent visit /darshan at Kedarnath mandir on 26th may  through gmvn chardham yatra was with mixed feelings of total fulfillment and sense of disappointment .the helicopter arrangement was  mismanaged. gmvn who has organised the chardham yatra is noncommittal .user has to manage for himself.this saps the energy moving from place to place to sort out the problem.the local civil authorities were quite helpful.the pilgrims had to sleep in the tourist vehicle on 26th may .suggest a total review for a  single window approach by gmvn for arrangement of helicopter at kedarnath/palki/horse at yamunotri as this add to their value of chardham package .
7,A trip you'd be so glad you went to!,It was just an awesome experience. We are a gang of 8 guyz planning to visit kedarnath from the past 3 months everything was set and only concern is how to reach there and finally we decided to choose bikes and we r in so much confusion that from where to takes bikes and yes bikrrentalrishikesh did it for us ...it was an amazing experience working with not just with the quality of bikes they provided but their behaviour generiousty and warm welcome was awesome.

You guyz rocks. I will suggest everyone to take the service atleast once so that you will enjoy your trip on full mode. $$#$$##Bikrrentalrishikesh ko apne trip me laga dala to life zingalala$#######.
8,Kedar Yatra,"I visited Kedarnath on 26th May 2018.I would like to share few points with.       Though we booked Chardham trip through SOTC,the operator did not give us details of our Helicopter tickets before hand.Hence faced the following difficulties.    Our hotel was 24 KM away from helipad. Which is a long distance keeping in mind the mountainous area.There was a helipad next to our hotel but that was not booked.   Day before the Kedarnath trip when we asked for tickets we were told to go to helipad by 9 AM. We had same day return promised by SOTC. We approached the helipad staff several times asking them to send us as soon as possible. They issued our boarding passes at 3 P M. After 1 hour break we flew only at 430 PM. Could make it to the temple by 5 PM only. Also we purchased Rs 2500/ special VIP darshan tickets at helipad in which Rs 400/ prasad was included.despite our VIP darshan tickets we were asked to go to some counter to make some entry. Gained darshan only at 530 PM that too only for a split second as we joined the  general queue. Could not touch the Lord .   Also while entering the temple security guard tore our darshan tickets into two pieces. When approached the authorities for prasad he asked us to get the remaining part of the torn ticket. When approached the security guard he said he threw away the other half of the ticket. The staff at the counter refused giving prasad to us despite explaining to them that we purchased VIP darshan tickets at helipad spending Rs 10000/- for 4 people. We showed him the leftover ticket we had in which 4 X pax was mentioned along with word special VIP darshan. Also due to the bungling of our tour operator in arranging helicopter tickets we had to stay back at Kedarnath that night making our own arrangements.The temperature was -1 degrees.   Despite all this we really enjoyed the beauty of Kedarnath early in the morning and returned back. Please keep the above points in arranging things at Kedarnath and do not believe your travel agent blindly"
9,great choice using helicpoter their are many companies i suggest you to not chose pawan hans,"Five of us all Mid fifties planned to trek Pancha Kedar and the visit Badrinath to complete the trip. Trek and Temple was theme. We flew from Blore to Delhi, train to Haridwar and Car Xylo to Gauri Kund. For folks doing it for the first time, keep in mind the distance is not 14 km its more like 18-20 km. For us city folks every KM seemed like 5 KM. Half the stretch is well cemented and second half is poor and rain and horses make it worse. Take your time daylight is there till about 8 pm.We planned to start after a dip at Gauri Kund, this was a disaster there is about teaspoon of water we ended having bath under a tap. Buy yourself a rain coat in case you are not carrying one, 20/- one will serve the purpose for the day. It will also cover your backpack.If you are a group with baggage, think about hiring a horse to carry your baggage 1500 will be the cost. They may say you have rent horses in pairs ..ask around you will find a single horse guy. In other places  say Madmaheswar or Rudranath you have to hire in pairs.You need not worry about refreshments there are 2 places every step.TRhe better place to stay at Kedarnath is GMNV guest house. Food at their restaurant is bland and expensive, you can eat at opposite huts or closer to temple."
10,A journey to infinity,"We have visited Kedarnath on 20th May 2016, Which was third destination of our Char Dham Yatra after Yamunotri and Gangotri. We were group of 12 with youngest at 2 years and elder of 61.Sonprayag was place where you can book pony so we have decided to start journey from there but as It was peak season, most hotels in Sonprayag were full and rest demanding unreasonable price so we went to Sitapur and stay there for night and reached Sonprayag early at 3am so that we can book pony.After reaching Sonprayag we join the queue for Pony Booking Counter which opens at 5, You have to produce license of Pony Holder when you book Pony, so standing in line early is not guarantee for you to get Pony. You have to negotiate with License Holder to get License from him and Book Pony. You can also book Pony from Gaurikund but you have to Reach there Early as from Sonprayag you can start for Gaurikund after 6.00am. For Palkhi you have to book it from Gaurikund, So Staying overnight and start Journey from here in Morning is Good Option, but for that you have to Reach Sonprayag ill late evening as after 9.00pm travelling from Sonprayag to Gaurikund is not allowed. After Getting license and booking Pony we have travelled from Sonprayag to Gaurikund via Local Vehicle (Rs. 20 per Person) and Start Wonderful Journey from Gaurikund on Pony.The new route is about 18 to 20km. Jungle, Slope, Slant, Bridges, Fog, Rain, River, Waterfall and Snow, Not in particular order, but it's Beautiful. It took 5 hours to reach us Kedarnath and after 1 km walk we have reached temple at 1.00pm. After 2 hr wait in queue we had very good Darshan and Start Return Journey.No Network after Sonprayag so either get local SIM or keep your mobile switched off. Do not rely on any network as it's not totally dependable.If you want to return on same day start very early and book return Pony.If it's late you can stay at camp which is on the way. Don't travel after 6.00 pm.For Helicopter ride book in advance and keep buffer of 1-2 days as service get affected if weather is not good.For Pony Booking use your negotiation skill or get ready to spend double of Government Rate. Limited number of Pony available at the time we visited, so If you get late you won't get Pony or Palkhi."
11,Unique presence,"I visited kedarnath on 1st of may and must say was the best visited temple this year. Thanks god that there was no rush at all and i got more than 1/2 hr to sit next to kedar baba ... i had 3 senior citizens and 1 infant with me . There were some issue when my mother in law was trackin up from the helipad.....she was short of breath. There was not much facilities available like food , water so please carry eatables for kids and enough water for adults....."
12,Major highlight in char dham yatra,"We visited Kedarnath on 12th and 13th May 2015.  We took helicopter(Rs.7000/- both ways) from  Sersi. It takes about 8 minutes to reach Kedar.  There are a number of helicopter companies operating from different places around Guptkashi. If one wants to trek, it is 21kms from Sonprayag. The route is Sonprayag-Gaurikund-Limcholi-Kedarnath.  Horses and Dandies are also available.The helicopter ride is short and sweet. From the helipad the temple is about half km. When we got off the helicopter, it was a wonderful sight and freezing cold.  The Kedarnath shrine stands facing the Mandakini valley against a backdrop of majestic, snowy peaks and is one of the 12 jyothirlingas.  The form the shiva worshipped here is very different.  The devastation caused by the 2013 floods is to be seen, to be believed. There is nothing left in kedar other than the temple.  Now NIM and GMVN have erected camps for the pilgrims.  The food is also available at these camps.  NIM camp is just behind the Helipad and GMVN camp is about 1KM before the helipad(from GMVN camp one has to walk about 1.5kms to reach the temple). We stayed in the GMVN camp.  The tent allotted to us was very good and comfortable.  It had five beds and two toilets with geysers.The temple is magnificent and the feeling can not be explained.  We had Nirvana darshan in the morning.  There was lot of rush and may be temple authorities should do something to streamline the same and allow people to go one by one. The evening Alankara darshan was too good. The evening Aarthi starts at 7.30pm.  The Aarthi was very special and an unforgettable experience.  Sri Shankaracharya samadhi which was at the back of temple has been washed away in the floods.  They have just kept an idol of Adi Guru sri shankaracharya in the place where the samadhi stood once.  There is big rock(called Bhima shila) behind the temple which has rolled down from the mountain and protected the temple during the floods. It is just unbelievable."
13,Kedarnath a spiritual journey ,"I have been to Kedarnath temple for overnight one day trip with my parents, It was very convenient and easier trip, I was worried about the cost of helicopter package but it was under my budget."
14,Badrinaath Dham  Yatra on 8-Oct 2019,"We did the Kedarnath Yatra in September end. I had lot of queries before arranging this trip but could not get much information on Internet about the current situation in Uttarakhand after the 2013 disaster.  Hence I am writing this review. We took a road trip from Dehradun to Guptkashi. Which was around 200 KM drive but it took us 8 log hours to complete this journey because of a narrow roads passing through hills and a deep valley on the other side. Within a one year of the disaster, I’ll say that the authorities have done a great job of repairing and reconstructing the roads and bridges. At several points we could see the old section of road which is completely washed away and there was a new road constructed. Many of the bridges were destroyed and now they have constructed the new wider bridges by passing the old ones. 2014 rains have again destroyed the roads at several places but the repairing work is in progress. We stayed for a night at Guptkashi. Fortunately the weather was pretty clear.  Himalayan Heli services is running Helicopter rides for Kedarnath Darshan from Sersi. This was approximately 20KM distance from our hotel which took us 1 hour.  Himalayan Helicopter service was delayed for an hour because of weather problem but once they got a clearance our flight was scheduled immediately and we reached Kedarnath within a few minutes. It was a simply divine experience to finally reach at Kedarnath. This place is so beautiful!! Since there are not many pilgrims going on Char Dham yatra now, we had a very peaceful darshan and did pooja of Shri Kedarnath. We returned back by the same helicopter after one and a half hour.Here also authorities have done a great work of restoration. The place is in much much better state now than it was after the disaster. We are really happy that we took a chance and completed this yatra successfully and without any difficulty."
15,Kedarnathji from Haridwar,This is the 2nd time I am visiting Kedarnath. Earlier I visited through old road at least 20 years back. That time also I trekked and this May visit also I did trek.  It was amazing to see the nature; while  I was passing through the glacier I was really feeling elevated.
16,Kedarnath Darshan,"I Visited temple on 15th May 2016. I was fortunate to get the Heli tickets. I reached temple at 8:30 am. Pure and pristine Mandakini river flows there. You can wash your feet and take bath (in case) in its icy cold refreshing water. You can very well carry its water in container for taking it with you to home. There was very small queue at that time when I reached temple (waiting time 1 hr). Authorities are also kind enough to give sufficient time to each devotee to complete your ritual inside the temple. There is particular importance of applying Ghee to the shivlinga. So, carry Ghee n your pooja samgri. At the back of temple, don't forget to take darshan of 'BheemShila' which supposedly diverted all the flood water directly rushing to the temple while in 2013 flash flood."
17,Kedarnath Temple,"Five friends had started their journey for Kedarnath on 14th August 2009 from our college KEC Dwarahat (Almora). By end of day we could not be able to reach Sonprayag. We stayed overnight at some lodge (cheap hotel) at Guptakashi. on 15th Aug we have started our trekking to Kedarnath. Although it was showering, we continued our journey have a lunch break at midway. By evening we reached at Kedarnath. We planned to stay for atleast 3 days to explore beauty of nature nearby Kedarnath, but we had to drop our plan due to rain and fog. We stayed overnight and returned next day to Sonprayag and rushed to Sari village for Tunganath and Devariya Taal trek."
18,Kedarnath temple,"I was doing a solo travel to Kedarnath as I was having pretty good idea that I must do a 16 km one side walk, which I have never done before....I was so thrilled to do the same and was so excited throughout the journey. I started by waking up by 3:30 in the early morning and took a bath from the gaurikund hot water spring, which was first in my life time. Later I started the journey by 5 in the morning after small tea. Hill full of amazing view and I being travelling alone could enjoy the the Beauty to the extreme. I was so happy to see the Mandakini river flowing through my side. I was well planned and took bananas with me to eat, which I guess it's the best while travelling. I was so tired and kept on saying the Manta ""om namah shivaya"". Everything went well and I reached Kedarnath and has the luck to get the blessings from lord of Kedarnath. The beautiful hilly view will definately make your Senses go crazy. And it took me about 16 hours to complete the whole journey. ""Om namah shivaya"" 🙏"
19,Just Divine : Cant Ask For More :-),"A supreme adobe of peace in Badrinath. We have visited on 8th Oct 2019, due to road block at Rambagad, we had 4-5 hours late and reached dham at 11:40AM. Had darshan before 12:30PM as the temple is closed from 12:30PM to 3:30PM. Temple had provided prasad(Rice, Dal and Yellow rice) and that was divine."
20,Blessed ,"First of all I would thank UTTTARAKHAND TRIP TREK (UTT),We visited kedarnath in Sep first week with frnds, weather was cool and rainy. There was no shops for tea, snacks. When we had visited the temple helicopter Service had not started due to bad weather, so we completed the journey by Trek. As it was very rainy when we reached so there was no queue we did darshan 4 times, watched the temple aarti. The river Mandakini flows near the temple and joins alakandanda at Rudraprayag. Kedarnath temple is also one of the 12 jyothirlingas of lord shiv, The view of the valley and the mountains and choppers landing and taking off. Its just awesome.Overall experience was very good, would like to visit again despite the fact that way is very dangerous, no amenities are there."
21,A must visit Holy place,I visited temple on 24 july. We started trekking at morning 5 after registration. The trekking here is very difficult and not everyone's cup of tea. If U want to trek up and come down on the same day it's highly advisable to hire a pony. It talks the pony 4 hours to climb up and they leave u 1 km ahead. You get the most beautiful site from here.Things to know:Always advisable to hire a pony Don't hire a pony for round tripCarry woolen and rainy clothes as the weather is most unpredictable Think twice if u planning to trek as it's not easy at all. Disclaimer: Not to discourage anyoneEveryone here only wants to make money and is selfish. Better to ask the police people if u have any doubts Even the pandits will fake and try to charge more be awareThe cab people will charge very high amount The hotels in sonprayag are not good Low maintained There are no much safety measures taken by the govtThank you
22,Wonderful,We visited this temple while our pilgrimage for Char Dham Yatra.this was our visit to Himalayan glacier so we were quite excited.we took the Helicopter ride at the base form there it took about 15 minutes to reach the top.Since the massive floods about 3 years ago govt.has not allowed or build any hotel to stay hence there is nothing much available to eat or stay except tents for people who come by walking  21 KM From the base.however in our case we were allowed to spend 30-45minutes by Helicopter co'. To return.it was lovely visit and since we travelled in the 1st week of May there was no rush.weather changes so frequently it may scare you.if it rains they will stop the ferrying you to the base & helicopter service is available till 5PM while returning to base so one has to plan well else you will stick up living in tent at Kedarnath.A
23,Ultimate Divinity,"We visited Kedarnath mandir, early this month. We had a good darshan. The place is really heavenly placed in the clouds. The months of may and June beginning there will be immense rush. Everyone told us that September and October is the best time to have a peaceful darshan.We went by helicopter ride. The official cost is 7500. But most of the tickets are held by agents and they charge from 9500 upto 15000 depending on the demand. If we book 15 to 20 days in advance we can get it directly. There is restrictions on weight in helicopter and for people above 85 kgs they charge extra. And luggage is also restricted.The darshan queues are really long and you can buy a VIP darshan ticket at 2100 per ticket.There are lot of tents and some cottages in Kedarnath. They are decent enough and available. The weather was pretty cold on top, we need to take proper warm clothes to the top.The Darshan was definitely worth all the trouble that we had take to complete it."
24,Divine experience,"Blessed....I did my helicopter booking from Himalayan Heli services in month of may.We started on 4th May 2018. 1. Left from Haridwar and did my biometric pass which is mandatory for Darshan. 2. Reached Rudraprayag which took us almost 6 hours. Took a halt.3.Started to leave for Sersi from where I had my helicopter booked for Kedarnathji.4. 8 mins to Kedarnathji from our helipad.5. Took Darshan which almost took is 1hour. VIP pass available at 2500 per person.6. Pre booked my cottage  	Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. Good rooms  domitary style. IMP notesPre book helicopter and staying arrangements.Be ready for rain and very low temperatures as low as 10 to 5 degrees.Carry nuts , snacks etc as the food options are ok.Regards Tarun Samvedi Virar Mumbai"
25,Kedarnath and Badrinath the wonder,"Great experience. I walked up and down, started at 6 am from gaurikund and reached kedarnath by 1pm. It was raining while I was returning. Even then I reached back in 6 hours. Never miss it."
26,Spiritual peace in mountains,"Kedarnath is one of the 12 jyotirlinga temples.We visited this Temple last week while our dodham yatra. We visited this temple by helicopter, We missied our 2 helicopter rides because of technical problems in helicopter finally our third attempt was successful. Had wonderful darshan. We put Ghee on Shivling and did abhishekam with water.  The weather was minute by minute changing.  And 4 members in  our group held up there for return trip for helicopter.  Finally, they came back by horses to Gourikund and from there they take Taxi for Sornaprayag.   So, mentally prepare for everything to have Kedar JI darshan.  In Badrinath we had Vishnu Sahasranamavali Darshan for Rs.901/- for 2 persons.  It was very nice experience.  Our vehicle will go near to the temple so not much problem,  This Place is called Bhoo Vaikuntam.  Very auspicious place on the earth.  Lord Vishnu himself come to this place to do Dhyan.  If you do One mala it will count to 10000 mala here.  We booked our dodham package through SHUB YATRA TRAVELS, Rishikesh.  They are very helpful and kind enough in all aspects. Thanks to God for giving great darshan experience in both the places."
27,Kedarnath is one of the most sacred Hindu temple,"Visited Kedarnath Temple on 16.06.2015. Took the Pawan Hans Helicopter from Phata at 12 pm. It costs 7000 for a return ticket and flight duration is about 7 minutes. The moment you step out, something magical takes over. As you walk towards the Temple (less than 1 km), the dome becomes visible. Once inside, it is hard to describe the experience. Do not forget to see the ""Divyashila"" (Holy Rock) that saved the Temple in the 2013 disaster. Only divinity can be the answer as to how such a rock got stuck just behind the temple in all the fury and saved the temple. Had lunch being served by NAM. Very hygienic, tasty and economical at Rs. 70 per person. Took the chopper back and was in Phata at 3 pm. All in all, a truly amazing anf life changing 3 hours. KUDOS TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR YATRIS. Put this in your bucket list for 2016, if not in 2015."
28,Grand Almighty,"First visit to Kedarnath, such a mesmarising experience. We have very good darshan of bhole bath. Want to visit again."
29,Gods Abode - Come and Experience Divine,It was beautiful & memorable experience at this temple. From Gaurikund to kedharnath temple fourteen km. You must go by walk or by pony.
30,Char Dham tour,"We guys recently visited Kedarnath Temple in month of August 2015. Really the flash floods in 2013 was terrible all of the Temple Surroundings was swept away, Except Main Temple.... ,One huge rock (Exact Temple horizontal width) was a saviour of temple, We guys moved 200 to 300 meters behind the temple to find the secret of how the huge rock came behind the temple, but Unfortunately we cant. Because all rocks were small rocks around the temple surrounding, except this huge one. Apart of this, we reached this temple with strenuous trek of 22km from Sonprayag, all vehicles can drop till here only, because the road route till Gaurikund was damaged in flash floods, we reached Sonprayag afternoon, already a group of 50 people has sent to Kedarnath by BSF Police, we just timepass by seeing a lcd tv in information centre in Sonprayag, the government of Uttarakhand has arranged a free Wi-Fi in all base camp areas till Kedarnath and they completely monitoring the weather conditions enroute to Kedarnath. Around 5pm the next batch is allowed to go till Gaurikund which is 4km away from Sonprayag, a BSF Police men asked Yatris come in line and show their Yatra registration card and health certificate(were yatri can obtain in Guptakasi check point). We reached Gaurikund by 7pm. Next day morning we wake up with rain, after visiting Gauri Temple in Gaurikund we started the Journey towards to kedarnath, we reached Kedarnath by 3pm they are hardly 50-70 members around the temple including Purohit(Pandits) and Shopkeepers, we have seen a huge damage around temple...... that upsets our minds, we performed a ghee Pooja to Shiv ling and Prayed... All the people who lost their lives Rest in Peace.Things to carry:-Rain jacketWoollen SweaterTrekking shoesCameraNecessary medicines."
31,Faith moves Mountains - Pilgrimage to Kedarnath ,"I and my mother aged 78 went for Gangothri, Kedarnath Ji and Badrinath Ji pilgrimage.  I decided to skip Yamunothri for 2 reasons - 1) I felt it is a long trip adding two days to my trip duration 2) there was a trek at the end of it that is strenuous for mom 3) I felt there isn't enough religious significance (strictly my opinion).  Hence, our trip was to visit three Dhams only.  The length of the trip was 8 days door to door, I had added a buffer day in case of weather / other factors.  We started on 17th of September and were to return on 24th.Day 1: 1150 Jet flight from Mumbai direct to Dehradun, arrival at 1410.  Flight was excellent and on time.The cab driver was waiting for us.  I had specifically asked for a reasonably new Innova basis my previous experience in mountain roads.  We started from airport at 3 pm and the goal was to reach Uttarkashi by dinner time. We took a route via Mussorie and it was beautiful all along.  We got clouds and mist for company once we crossed Mussorie.  We stopped for coffee at 5 pm and crossed Uttarkashi by 8.30. I had booked at a small hotel called Ananda Ganga at Netala, on the main road to Gangothri.  It was right by Ganga and set very nicely.  We were the only residents that night.  Krishnaji who owns the place had arranged for a nice meal and his nephew Praveen was the caretaker.  We reached the hotel by 9 and had a nice dinner.  It was absolutely peaceful with only Ganga's roar for company.  It was mildly cold (20 degrees). The room was on the first floor and comfortable.  We slept peacefully by 10.Day 2: GangothriWe started at 6.30 after a cup of coffee.  The drive was even better with Ganga for company through out.  The road was okay for the most part, some bad patches thanks to landslides (it is very common during rains, not to panic) and flowing water.  We reached Gangnani at 8 AM. There is a Hot spring here and it is customary to take a dip in this pool before proceeding to Gangothri.  We did and it was amazing.  Water was hot and incredible.  There is a small temple here and after spending about half an hour, we continued to Gangothri. We stopped for breakfast at a small dhaba - the guy made special alu paratha for mom (no onion, garlic etc plus no masala).  One learning was to carry some breakfast with us, as the food joints in this sector are average and could be problematic for strict customers like my mother.  Eventually, we reached Gangothri by 11.  We went straight to the river (a 10 minutes easy walk) and was approached by pandas for Pooja / Tharpanam etc. The river is beautiful, fast flowing and muddy thanks to the rains.  We got down and washed our feet and face, felt awesome!  Then we settled down for a tharpanam and Pooja. It was nicely done, gave the pandit a handsome dakshina and proceeded to the temple. After Darshan of various moorthis, it was time to leave. Btw, there is a trek to Gaumukh, 18kms and I didn't go for it.  Had a quick lunch of rotis and daal / curd, plenty of options there.  We left at 1 pm and reached hotel by 4.30.I couldn't resist going for a quick walk around the place - it was incredibly beautiful.  A suspension bridge across the river took me to the other side of the river and I walked around through the village and forest for an hour.  After coming back, sat down by the river for some time.  Great place to meditate, maybe next time!  The water was nice and cold and I thought about a quick dip, better sense prevailed!Krishnaji came around evening and we chatted about the place, temples etc.  He has built his hotel as a retreat and he lets out selectively to keep the serenity intact.  There is a nice Yoga room and he runs courses in summer.After another simple, tasty dinner, we called it a day and went to bed hearing Ganga in the background. Day 3: Guptkashi, en route TO Kedarnath Ji.Again, we started by 6.45.  Praveen packed alu parathas for us.  We went to Uttarkashi Viswanath temple.  A nice temple like the Kashi Viswanatha temple.It was going to be a long drive.  Stopped a couple of times for coffee and then lunch.  The ride was brilliant!  Reached Guptkashi by 4 pm, checked in to Kailash Residency, close to Phata.Two things here: 1) I had decided that we will go helicopter to Kedarnath Ji. After research, booked on Pawan Hans on their web site.  Since morning weather tends to be better in mountains, (my own theory, basis experiences in Leh and Kedar Kantha before) I had booked 7 AM up and 10.30 AM down. 2) I had booked hotels only for the first stop as I was not sure about exactly where we will reach every evening due to possible weather / road issues.  This turned out well as I could choose hotels; September is not peak season and hence I could find plenty of options.So decided to stay close to Phata, the helipad spot.  Kailash hotel was decent - right by the road, nice and clean and excellent service.  Food was really good and mom enjoyed the food.  Everything as advertised!Evening, went to the Guptkashi temple.  An old, small temple having Viswanath Ji and Ardhanareeswarar idols.  There was a small Ganga Jamuna stream in front.  Overall, good to see if one has time.After a nice dinner, retired early.  Excitement was building for next day visit to Kedarnath Ji.Day 4: Kedarnath Ji, absolutely mind blowing!So we started early by 5.45, reaching Phata by 6.15. Reporting time for the 7 AM trip was supposed to be 6 AM and there was no one!  The friendly tea vendor asked to give a call and soon someone showed up.  He goes like ""our helicopter has some technical issues, hence we are putting you on another company's helicopter"". Sounds familiar?  No point in getting worked up, so plan B it is.  UTAir was right next door (there are at least 5-6 operators around Guptkashi) and we were taken there.  The crew seemed reasonably professional and things moved forward quickly.  There was a large Tamil group who had booked ahead of us and they left in groups of 5-6 depending on weight of the passengers.  Our turn came at 7.45.  (The helipad waiting room feels like a bus stand actually, with a stinky toilet to boot!)After a quick security check etc, we boarded the helicopter. There were going to be 6 of us plus the pilot. I was in the front seat and mom in the back.  She could get in without too much trouble and soon were up and away!I had done a helicopter trip many years back in New Zealand.  Mom was a little tense.  However, the ride was perfect, the weather was clear and sunny.  No bumps, even better than a flight take off.  After a 8 minute ride over the trees and hills, we landed in Kedarnath helipad.It was a little more cold than Phata, must have been around 15.  No winds though.  We walked up to the shrine, plenty of porters with a chair on their back offering to help (what all man needs to do earn a living!), but mom walked slowly and steadily.  I kept reminding her to walk slowly and stop every few steps as oxygen levels are lower up there.  Panda time again and I thwarted them off.  The place is incredibly beautiful with the peaks in the back.  However,  there are signs of 2013 devastation still around and construction is on for camps etc.  The temple looked beautiful.  I eventually engaged a panda who appeared less pushy.  He asked me to buy a few things - some stuff for prasad, ghee, honey, milk, bhasmam, chandanam etc.  I got the first two only as I was not sure what to expect.  We went in and what strikes is the sheer size of the lingam and the unusual shape (like the hump of a bull).  The lingam must be 2-3 feet across and 2 feet tall.  We waited next to it for a good 15 mins for our turn.  Then our panda asked us to sit next to the lingam and started the Pooja.  It was incredible to be this close to a Jyotirlingam and then eventually smear Ghee with own hands.  We spent a good 15 mins doing the Pooja and we were overwhelmed to say the least!  Rest of the details are a blur!  Next time (if there is one), should definitely carry all the stuff the panda recommended.We came out by 9.15 and after some coffee and packed parathas, boarded the return helicopter.  Again the ride was awesome and we were down in Phata by 10.15! Our driver couldn't believe it!! I guess we were lucky that every thing went smoothly.We got back to hotel and took rest for some time.  Post a nice lunch, it was time to pack up and proceed to Badrinath Ji!We made a quick de-tour to visit Kalimath, a siddha peed.  It was quite a rough ride of about 10 kms and the temple was empty.  We were about to move out when a priest came and we did a quick Pooja. It was a tantric place and felt different - could feel the vibrations though! Hindsight : could have avoided this detour.Post Kalimath, time to push towards Badrinath Ji.  The aim was to ride for 4-5 hours and stay en route, maybe in Joshimath.The route we took was incredibly beautiful via Ukhimath / Chopta / Chamoli.  The rolling meadows of Chopta followed by dense forests of Mandal were absolutely mesmerising.  The sky was cloudy by now and it started raining heavily - we rode in dense forest with poor visibility for 45 minutes.  Two big Sambhars crossed ahead of us as a special treat!  Finally we got out of the forest by 5.30 pm as the light was going down.  The driver was thankful that no tree fell down and blocked the way!We made upto Pipalkoti and decided to stop for the day as the time was 7.30 and all of us were tired.  After looking around for a while, stayed at Uday Palace hotel.  It was an old hotel that had seen better times.  However, the room was clean enough and basics in place.  I wouldn't recommend this place though!Next morning started by 7 am.  Reached Joshimath by 8.30.  Went to Narasimha temple first - what chaitanyam! No wonder as we learned that the idols were installed and worshipped by none other than Adi Shankaracharya.  Above the temple, there is a small room where a statue of Adi Shakanra is installed, he attained Gyanam here.  You could feel a powerful presence in this temple for sure.  There are a couple more small temples around here, definitely worth visiting.  We then crossed the road and went to Shankara Mutt out of curiosity.  A young boy came and gave us a description of the entire place.  Apparently the pontiff doesn't sit here, he visits once in a while.  There is a nice temple with a beautiful Sphatika lingam.  The young student was so happy that we're from Kerala, the land of Shankara, that he went out of the way to engage us.We left by 9 and stopped at Nandaprayag.  There is nice temple at the confluence of Dhuli Ganga and Nandakini.  We had some light breakfast there and proceeded.  The route was becoming incredibly beautiful with Alakananda running by side and beautiful peaks around. The road is tricky though with plenty of bad patches and the possibility of landslides.  We stopped at Pandavkar on the way.  It is a short trek only.  The temples are small but beautiful and have Badrinarayanan idol.  This whole place has strong linkage to Pandavas, either during their ajnathavasam or vanaprastham.  The climb back a little strenuous for mom as air was a little low on oxygen.  We made it to Badrinath by 1 pm.  Hindsight : could be avoided as mom struggled to climb back.Badrinath seemed to be a bustling town.  We realised that it it going to be crowded as a Jeer was visiting next day and his followers have descended in plenty. It was Pithrupaksha also, and for whatever reasons, plenty of Telugu folks had come down too.  I enquired at Dwarkesh hotel and it was full.  Next up was Snow Crest and luckily we got the last room available - moral of the story, book early at Badrinath as supply is limited.  There are plenty of Dharmshalas though. Snow Crest is a new hotel.  After checking in, we had a good lunch.  Mother rest for a while and I went to explore the temple.  First things first - temple has a Kerala like system.  There are set poojas and Darshan is limited during this time.  One can take tickets for observing the poojas as well as other sevas.  I learned about this and tried to get tickets for some evening / morning poojas. There are a bunch of ticket counters around temple, again no hassle of touts.  The temple opens at 4.30 for Darshan in the afternoon and the counters open at the same time.There are a number of pujas (similar to sevas in Tirupati, however, performed in the sanctum sanctorum itself).  The list should be there on the web site.  I tried to get for Aarti or Vishnu Sahasranamam or the Closing puja (Sayana puja). Managed to get for Vishnu Sahasranamam.  The lady in the counter was very kind and directed me to the main counter inside to see if they've any blocked slots for the Sayana puja.  So I went into the temple, there was hardly a 10 mins wait.The Darshan was beautiful.  Badrinath Ji and his accomplices looked splendid, I could peacefully pray for a few minutes directly in front.  Unlike Kedarnath Ji, no one is allowed inside the Garbha Griha though.  I stepped out and finished Darshan of idols outside.  Don't miss the Nara-Narayana sannidhi!I went to the main counter and I was pleasantly surprised that one last ticket was available for the Sayana puja!  Mom will be super happy!I then headed out to enquire about the Brahma Kapal / Pithru Tharpanam procedure.  There is a  Ghat to the left of the temple and plenty of Pandas offering services here.  The belief is that if one does Pithru tharpanam at Brahma Kapal, no further tharpanams need to be done at other places such as Gaya etc.  (of course one should continue the regular tharpanam).  The temple provides Naivedya Rice for making Pindams.  One needs to bring basic things such as Panchapatram etc, rest everything is provided by the pandit.  One needs to watch out for greedy ones that recommend Daanam after tharpanam.  I was told that there are many packages from 1001 to 25000!Armed with all this, I went back and got mom back to temple by 5.30 pm.  The crowd had increased, still no much queue to enter.  After another round of Darshan, we waited for the Sahasranamam puja.  After various aaratis, our turn came.  We entered and to our utter dismay found that people had occupied every inch in front of the Garbhagriha! I gather people influence guards and priests and sneak in.  Anyways, the feeling was special - sitting in front of Badrinath Ji and listening to the chanting!  It lasted for about half an hour and we exited (be prepared for the typical madness to get blessings etc).We waited for another 2 hours for the Sayana Pooja. In between, the seer came for Darshan and there was a tremendous swell leading to a bit of delay.  Entering inside for Sayana Pooja was similar to the earlier one, quite chaotic.  People shamelessly enter the queue and sneak in, some habits never change I guess.Sayana Pooja was incredible.  Step by step, the Alankarams (Decorations) are removed amidst chanting and eventually the bare moorthis are exposed.  This Pooja lasts for almost 45 minutes and one gets tremendous vibes.We exited the temple close to 9 pm and had dinner right outside - dosas! Not bad for a high altitude, remote location.Next day, we got ready by 5.30 and reached the temple by 6.  The queue for Darshan was building up - it took us almost 2.5 hours to have Darshan eventually.  I was told that morning Darshan is always crowded and better to get in by like 4.30 AM.We quickly proceeded to the Ghat area for tharpanam.  It was drizzling and quite cold that morning (Neelkantha peak was not visible at all thanks to the dense fog).  I had bought a Dothi previous evening and sat down for the tharpanam by the river.  A Telugu speaking acharya led us (I joined a couple of southern folks) through the process.  After about half an hour, took the Pindas and after keeping on Brahma Kapal Rock, I prayed to ancestors and dropped those in the river.  The water was ice cold.We returned to the hotel and I decided to move out quickly as the weather was getting bad.  After a quick lunch, we left Badrinath by 1.30.It had started raining and hence the roads were tricky.  We had to stop for almost 45 minutes due to a landslide - eventually, we were waved off one car at a time and asked to rush while looking out for incoming stones!  This was a little scary.  We made our way down and reached Rudraprayag by 8 PM.Rudraprayag is a bustling town.  Our stay at hotel Mandakini was good (except for a silly, intentional mistake - the receptionist assured the food is all vegetarian, however, while ordering food, the guests on next table asked for Chicken and promptly served!  Why lie?)We started bright and early and reached Rishikesh by 11.30.  The drive was perfect, along side raging Ganga.  After a quick tour of Laxman Jhoola, ghat, the Thryambakeshwar temple (setup like a mall, felt more like an exhibition than a temple) and picking up some stuff for kids and a quick lunch, it was time to dash to the airport.We thus concluded our three-Dham trip in a most fulfilling way thanks to divine blessings and wishes from dear ones.A few learnings :1) bargain hotel rates2) carry some food all the time3) be flexible as weather, traffic, temple Darshan can be unpredictable (I had a full buffer day, eventually didn't need it)4) park your ego at home, people are nice5) have cash and change with you; plenty of sadhus and pandas around.  Remember, they're dependent on pilgrims, that too for 5-6 months in a year only.6) food is not an issue, most places accommodate special requests7) driving is tough as roads are demanding - be empathetic to the driver.  Be alert and make sure he is fresh and not sleepy!"
32,Heavenly Experience,"Om namashivaya,, kedarnath temple is very famous temple I visited, this is one of 12 jothirlings,, it's very cold, this temple is in Himalayan ranges so very cold, every one must visit this temple"
33,Kedarnath - The unforgettable journey,"Hello everyone. We a group of 11 members with minimum age of 19 and maximum of 60 years visited kedarnath and badrinath temple this may. I specifically want to write this post for travellers  planning for kedarnath. The trek distance is not 16km it's total of 21 km, but the board's and all the information available considers only 16km. So please brace urself accordingly. The whole trek path is not at all equipped with toilets, rain shelter or even water source. For us it was real examination with rain and wind. Each and every member of our family had to go through lot of hardship. People who are planning to trek kindly send your laugauge through pittho because it's very difficult to walk specially with bags. Do carry basic medicines. We enjoyed the temple and definitely the scenic beauties but really heart broken to see one of the most prestiouges temples of India in this condition. Lot many things are needed to be done. Weather and slope of the path is already a big challenge, lack of facilities and shelters make it even more worse. Key points:1) pls don't carry heavy bags.2) Do keep some gap in the itenary. Two days for kedarnath is a must.3) carry oxygen cylinder and important medicines.4)pls keep lot of emergency cash, as there is no way to withdraw cash.5)proper woollen clothes are needed.It's difficult but not impossible. Keep the spirit high and chant lord shiva. Every individual have different experience.Don't loose hope! Be safe keep travelling.Feel free to message for any support."
34,Tough hike,"We a group of 6 people from Bangalore visited kedarnath in the month of oct2017.ours was customized trip from dehradun in innova car.from Bangalore we boarded direct flight to dehradun 1noonby indigo.we reached by 5 30 to airport and our hotel in hrishkesh by 7 o'clock .next day early morning we proceeded to sitapur  hotel shivalik,just 5kms from helipad in sirsi(Himalayan helicopter service)As we were given after noon slot due to heavy rush,we went helipad by 2pm  we were taken only by 4pm.and reached kedarnath by 4  10 pm,,We walked Abt 30 mts(500ms)to reach temple premsies.there r so many lodges and rooms available there with minimum facilities but cheap,after keeping our luggages in our room we went to temple. We  have prcautionsto keep ourselves warm,As there  was less crowd we got good Darshan  up to our satisfaction.in the night temp  went down below -7degree and no heaters in rooms only razayis ,and frquent interuption of electriccity,we some hardship there due to altitude ,heaviness in head ,headache and beathlessness,but we heard if we take little alcohol ,which we are not used to ,this disconfortcan be resolved,But for any hard ship there is a reward,we got chance to see undecorated swayambhoo Linga by 5. 30AM and performedabhishekam pooja.As per given time by helicopters for 6.30.,we went helipad ,it was very chilly weather...Helicopter company cheats you if you r not particular to keep with you set ,we reached based helipad by 9 last person.(as they send one by one in every trip with others people)after refreshing from hotel  we proceeded to our destination badrinath."
35,Devine destination,"I started my pony ride from Gaurikund to the temple. This is about 16km. Along the route, every 2 km, there are shops selling snacks. The road is well maintained thanks to the several personnel enroute who remove the dung strewn by the ponies.It is a treat to watch the terrain during the travel. I didn't feel difficulty while going up but coming down was extremely grueling.Since I went during off season, I had darshan for about 45 minutes, in many stretches. On the whole a must watch temple."
36,Absolutely amazing BUT..,"We took Helicopter from Guptkashi for Kedarnath.Its a 14 min ride and when you enter the Kedarnath valley  a big ""AHA "" will come out.I will suggest that one should always take a night stay in Kedarnath.After checking in at GMVN Guest House we went for 'Bhairo Baba' Darshan about 1 KM trek from  Kedarnath.The view from there is breathtaking.In evening go for the Sandhya Aarati at Kedarnath Temple.It is simply divine.The darshan at time of our visit (Mid October)was very peaceful with no crowding and no waiting in queues.The food at GMVN guest house kitchen was good.We had booked cabins.The bathrooms had running water but not hot.You will get Hot Water for a cost - Rs 20 for a bucket that too not real hot.But every thing is forgotten when you visit the Temple and look at the snow peaks around you particularly in moon lighted night.I had never experienced anything like my Kedarnath visit and all accompanying us agreed to it.My suggestion - if you can tolerate some real cold weather ( about 2 degree C) then go there in mid October.You can peacefully perform the Pooja.Jai Baba Kedar."
37,Holy Divine place...,"I visited this place with family. We have planned to go by helicopter but as it was early/starting days helicopter were not working because government has not given permission to fly if possible plan for this place sometime in May and June, we were there in May . please get your travelers registration cards done at the beginning of the trip without this you are not allowed to start your journey if possible book your horses also in advance at the counters.We all took horses and it is quite stressful journey for everyone involved. it takes around 6-7 hours to reach up and to go up each horse costs you Rs 1100-1500(As per govt rules) but as we were more members we didn’t get much horses from govt counter so we need to book it in black whose rate are different as per timing & public rush (We got horses between Rs 3000-3500) as i said it is stressful journey , quite busy and hectic narrow roads up the hill and half the path doesn’t have railings and everyone has that one narrow road to use so watch out carefully also bring along adequate food, water and rain jackets usually many people  buy these things on the way but as usual its better to have your own with you. As we were more members some started between 8:30-9:00am and last members started at 10am so all reached the temple at different time between 3:45pm to 4:45pm (One the way after 2pm everyday atmosphere changes and it starts raining we too have faced this situation rain with snow for all most 1:30-2:00 hrs) but temple closes at 5pm all members were too tired and were not in a situation to do darshan in next 15min but while going on the way to our booked rooms we met one Maharaj who has spoken with us and given us energy to walk fast and do darshan quickly before temple close so all members agreed and we did darshan as there was no queue after that as our rooms were booked in advance so we stayed there at night but I think almost temperature was between -3 to -5degrees it was too cold at midnight , govt also provides tent to stay there but as we have done advance booking in Ashram we stayed there.       While returning back next day morning no one was ready to sit on horse so some members took pithu  and other members walked down but it is dangerous to walk also one need to be much careful as its very slippery the pithu costed us Rs 4000-5000 (Depends upon weight) for each and it took us around 6 hours to reach Gaurikund. Note the followingIf HELICOPTERS service has started it is preferable to go by HELICOPTERS and you can avoid long queues up for darshan as helicopter also involves VIP darshan. (In early days/starting  HELICOPTERS service depends up on govt permission & if it has started than also everything depends upon atmosphere as climate changes daily & quickly)Bring enough food, rain jackets, trekking shoes , good backpack aged people face difficulty in taking oxygen so pl give them KAPUR to smell at regular intervals.Try to reach early & start early around 4-5 am to avoid big rush.Be careful and alert. Keep torch with you as there is electricity problem."
38,Great energy,I visited Kedar in 2nd week of May 2017. As a nature lover I decided to trek . But it was a wrong decision. The road was crowdy and most disturbing was the movement of hundreds of horses. you will be always busy giving them way. It rained and road became dirty with mud and horses excretion. It is always advisable to hire pony and travel. however the beauty of Kedar route was incredible and incomparable.
39,It was not a very good experience,"It is one of my most memorable and beautiful journey of my life.I booked a 4 wheeler form Haridwar to Kedarnath and Badrinath trip.There are two ways to reach the temple. One way by trekking or ponny ride of 22kms. other way you can go through a helicopter.If you go by treeking, you have to stay that night near to the temple. you can find goverment camp costing rs50/100 per day. If you are going by heli ride, you can return on that day.We went through heli ride, view from the heli is amazing. The temple is sourrounded by cnow clad mountains magnifying its beauty. please choose the right season to go there, summer season is best, but we went in september."
40,Kedarnath is heart of Himalaya but administration is not good,"Hi, We have traveled from Ghaziabad to Sonprayg in 15 hour by our Maruti Vitara Brezza car.Jorney is really tough so if you are coming to your own car , please travel with one additional driver.We stayed in Rishikesh, Devprayag, Rudrapyrag , Ukkimath.Please try to drive only in sunlight, its not safe or recommend to drive on these hill during the night.If you are traveling in peak season, try to book the accommodation in advance or try to stay 5-10 km from the Sonprayag .Please don't park your vechile in the Sonprayag parking.All the very best for the baba dharshan.Har Har Mahadev."
41,Devine place.. kedarnath ji 🙏,"Visited Kedarnathji Temple on 11th May 2015. Took Helicopter (Rs 7000 per person to & fro) from Rampur. It is very convenient to reach Kedarnathji Temple via Helicopter. Just 7 minutes flight. There are several Helicopter services available. Can go through trekking also but it is around 21 kms and take 5 to 6 hours. Ponies are easily available. Temple is just 300 mtrs from Helipad. Way to temple is perfect. Currently less Rush at temple. Govt. Arrangements are very good. You need to get Biometric pass from Rishikesh. Medical clearance need to be taken from Rampur. I think these are just formalities. However carry small Oxygen cylinder (Avl on rent in Rampur) in case you have some Asthmatic problem. Carry Ghee and Vastra with you to perform Puja at Shiva Linga. Rest all avl at Mandir premises. Can get Rs 1100 per head Darshan pass from Rampur, which will further ease Puja and Darshan at Temple. Feel highly satisfied by Lord Shiva's Darshan. On Namo Shivay!"
42,Jai Baba Kedarnath : Budget staying and travelling without prior plan : Know it all,Kedarnaath is one of the inportant place in 12 jotirling. it is just fantastic place. we visited with my family. u want go at this temple by waking or by horse. we started our  sita kund. their are 14km. road for reach to the temple.  bt just enjoyable snowing atmosphere. i just loved this place....
43,Delhi to Kedarnath by Car,"Started this yatra on 25/04( the second day of opening), in Son Prayag a medical examination is carried out, basically 4 doctors( 2 registering and 2 examining) are manning the cramped room, It took me 2,5 hours to clear this hurdle, pls ensure your blood pressure is normal, as many yatris were declared unfit.Around 200 metres walk from check post of Sonprayag, take a jeep for around 2,5 km and from there onwards start trekking to Gaurikund. The total distance now is aprox 20km or more from Sonprayag. Two more checkpoints for registering the char dam card. Many ponnies and palkis are available in SonPrayag ,Gaurikund and also along the way. But the pricing is still the same( as far as I enquired.)90% of the journey is ascending , so do prepare. After the second town after Gaurikund, no shops are available for purchasing any foods, not even in Kedarnath,so pls buy adequate essentials in advance. Along the way few rest stops and public water tanks are placed for public convenience. If you think the tap water wont be suitable for consumpation, pls bring mineral water as required.the journey is tough ascending between ices for the 40% of the journey with mountain clearing workers camps at few places . 1.5km away from the kedarnath temple, the GMVN has set up cottages and tents for minimum price and NIM  has also set up tents for public accomodations around 1 km from temple.It was raining and snowing on the 25/04, so nobody were there in temple except us and the security. Surrounding the temple ,ice formation is higher than the temple. Devotees are allowed into the inner temple in the mornings only. Checked in to the only available hotel within temple vicinity and stayed the whole night in bed.The next morning the temple doors opened at 7,30 am,amidst a long queue of devotees, we managed to go in within 20 minutes, and Kedarnath surprised me, HE wasn't like other SHIVA temples I have seen. Magical, mystified and bliss, Kedarnath is all in one. The tough walk amidst rain, icestone rain and snow flakes was worth the bliss. Enjoyed the journey albeit a struggling and testing walk."
44,Kedarnath Yatra,"This is my 2nd visit and 2nd Post for this to help the travelers.. Last time i did the visit by trekking and this time i used all the means like ponies and helicopter service.Yes trekking is very difficult if you are not used to it but i can say nothing is impossible if any point you feel you can't during your trekking then you can get pony. In helicopter it take only 10 mins to reach and 10 min to back from temple yes waiting would be little bit longer as lot off heli services introduced this year and they have scheduled time to & fro.  pony 1400-2100INR(to) max and for heli service from 6500-9500INR(to and fro).Try to avoid pony when you are coming back from temple.Book your online registration for Kedarnath darshan(100INR) and get your bio-metric registration at Rishikesh bus stand and start your journey .Always avoid rainy season, best season is September last/October and you will get some hotels at kedarnath temple for night halt, always start your journey early morning 4or4.30AM."
45,My final success at visiting Kedarnath Temple,We blessed to get the darshan of lord kedarnath and stay overnight thereDue to time constraints as we had come through travels we went to kedarnath by helicopter  which is being managed by Himalayan agencyThe other modes to reach kedarnath are by walk for 14km odd or by ponies It takes about 7 mins by helicopter to reach the top of the kedarnath temple and the charges varies from Rs 3000 to 4000 /trip If it is through Himalayan agency pls ensure that your weight is not above 80kgs otherwise for every additional kg you will be charged Rs 150Aadhaar card original is a must along with identity card which is issued by Uttarakhand govt which you need to register at Dehradun bus stand before you proceed for char dham yatraThe kedarnath temple timings are 6am to 3pm where you get the opportunity to perform puja physically to the lingam.we reached the temple by 2.30pm after which we bought a puja Thali and proceeded to the temple a purohit known to our travel agent made us perform the puja after which we did parikrama around the temple before it got closed.we returned to our rooms which is very close to the temple.Again at 5 pm we went for having darshan this time you are not allowed inside the garba griha as the Lord is decorated with flowers and a silver snake is kept on the tip of the lingam. Since there was very less crowd we again joined the queue to have glimpse of the Lord second time!!If you plan to stay there Pls go well equipped with sweater gloves socks etc. as it tend to get chilly as the evening dawns Overall a blessed  and memorable experience of having got one of the jyotirlinga shree kedarnath darshan
46,darshan at kedarnath mandir chardham trip through gmvn,You will have heavenly feeling upon visit to Kedarnath Temple. The pedestrian trek to Kedarnath is constructed by government after 2013 flood and is good track.
47,One of the best Shiv temple ,"We visited kedarnath in May first week with my mom along with her friends, weather was cool and rainy. There was no shops for tea, snacks. When we had visited the temple helicopter Service had not started, so we completed the journey by horse and returned by helicopter. As it was very rainy when we reached so there was no queue we did darshan 4 times, watched the temple aarti. Overall experience was very good, would like to visit again despite the fact that way is very dangerous, no amenities are there."
48,Witnessed Doors opening ceremony on first day - Life time experience,"Hi we are visited Himachal to Kedarnath with family by car.everything is great ,but administration are not professional, traffic is too bad , all people any wear park the car ,there is no system , police are not well trained to Handel the traffic.horses rider behaviour not good on the way of gaurikund to Kedarnath both side horses go and come, people who walked they are in trouble , everywhere horses ,there is no way to walk.if you walk it's dangerous.kedarnath is so beautiful, cleaning are fine , cleaners behaviour is good.one more thing gaurikund shopkeeper and hotels people cheat .for one bedroom they charge 3500 RS and police also involved because 1pm sometimes 2 pm they closed the way on gaurikund.after there is lot of yatri hotlear charge what ever they want.even 2 bed  room they charge 8000 RS.if we go any where in India with in 8000 RS we get a room in 4 to 5 star hotel.but in gaurikund hotel experience are bad. 1 LTR water bottle they charge 35 RS .ther is no system.We visited in Badri nath everything perfect.hotels ,shop everything they charge normal ,there is traffic but smoothly control.well manged .roads are perfect.police behaviour are nice they always ready to help.i request to police and administration team please checked this point and help to other people . please.thanks"
49,Jai Baba Kedarnath 🙏,Its been a life-time opportunity to seek blessings of Lord Kedarnath. Visited on 7th June 2013.With the recent natural fury..I do not know when next. The journey from Haridwar to Kedardham and Badridham is a total divine experience culminating in receiving blessings. Hope the Yatra resumes soon.May all souls departed from Uttarakhand during last fortnight rest in eternal peace.

51,"Bam-Bam bhole, Mesmerizing surrounding and magnificent temple","I visited Kedarnath temple in the month of may. Trekking of a 14 km distance from Gaurikund is an amazing experience. One should try to go by walk from Gaurikund to kedarnath as the immense pleasure you will experience by the <a class=""inlineAdmedialink"" href=""#"">beauty</a> of nature is unexplainable. But remember to start early in the morning from Gaurikund preferebly 5 AM in the morning as the weather may become volatile after 12 pm in the noon. I experienced dizziness after reaching kedarnath due to shortage of oxygen. Hence try to carry an oxygen cylinder (small size cylinders are available at Gaurikund for Rs around 300; you can return them if unused which inturn fetch you u refund after deducting some amount). Dont forget to carry hand gloves with you and a good quality woolen jacket. One thing I assure you that people of Uttaranchal are very friendly towards the tourists hence no need to have any <a class=""inlineAdmedialink"" href=""#"">safety</a> related concerns."
52,Natural beauty coupled with religious importance and associated history,I Travelled Kedarnath With My Friends We Have Enjoy All the MomentsI would Like To Go Again In 2020
53,A visit to Kedarnath Dham .....,"The trek from Gauri Kund to Kedarnath temple is the real charm of this destination. Though, one needs to be physically fit to take this trek which is at considerable attitude, the experience is something like a treasure to be cherished for life time. the snow capped peaks at Kedarnath are add ons."
54,Heaven on earth,Kedarnath temple is a place where we kind find everywhere and it is one of its kind. The backdrop and the 14kms way to  Kedarnath from Gaurikund is breathtaking. There is a feeling of peace when we are around the temple. But we have to be prepared with warm clothing to face the chilling temperatures up there. In spite of all this one should have a darshan of Kedarnath and be blessed
55,A trip to kedarnath and badrinath,Excellent place full peace of mind temple is very old . I went with my 6 yrs kid and stayed one night there. OM Namah Sivaya.
56,Ultimate spiritual and peaceful experience,It is better to avoid travelling to kedarnath and badrinath temple in monsoon the recent june 2013 of cloud burst with land slide is the worst example nature can set to beware travellers.There is expected to be delays in opening of kedarnath temple as the debris are not yet removed and the uttarkhand government is expected to clear the mess withing 1-2 yrs.
57,PLEASE TRY HANSA TRAVELS TO UNDERTAKE CHARDHAM YATRA. YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG,"Visiting Kedarnath is a lifetime ambition. We can reach Kedarnath by helicoter from Phata @ Rs 6000 to 7000 bothways but taking helicopter route is advisable in September. We visited during June and during that time heavy fog leads to cancellation of ride suddenly and therefore the journey becomes unpredictable. We were forced to halt for night stay at Phata due to fog and could take off to Kedarnath next day early morning and it takes only 10 minutes to reach. Alternatively go to Gaurikund and from there either walk or hire a horse. For old people Paalki arrangement is there. After reaching Kedarnath, weather is cold and Kailash with snow gives a chilling feeling. We can perform Puja inside the temple. Behing the temple, huge rock that saved the damage to temple during flooding has been named as Bheem Shila. Rehabilitation is in full swing. Good arrangement for night stay with free wifi service. Only BSNL network available. We could complete puja and Darshan within half an hour. Huge Nandi statue in the front portion of temple and people believe that you whisper your desire in the ear of Nandi and it wold be fulfilled. After the Darshan we cold not return via Helicopter route due to fog and after waiting for about 5 hours, decided to return on horse. We reached Gauri Kund in about 4.5 hours. Journey is quite tiring as slope is steep at times."
58,a sublime experience,I went to kedarnath for the first time that too after the floods..we went as  part of the first winter trek to kedarnath.. As soon as we started from gaurikund we could see the breath taking beauty of the valley.. The new route now makes one cross the mandakini river before Rambara (which does not exist anymore) the train is well built and is made keeping in mind people from different ages .. its a gradual ascent right to the temple..
59,Peaceful place,"The Jyothirlinga is not only huge but also very powerful. We as a group of 10 people had struggled our way through the 18 km trek from Gauri Kund, but after spending some time in the temple and witnessing the evening Aarti, you feel so refreshed. The new path is safe & wide but poorly designed as it is a constant upward ramp. Walking up a distance of 18 km on a continuous uphill ramp is very tiring. You can use horse or helicopter as well to reach the temple. Much better facilities on the top now a days with room heating, hot water and hot food. Don't bother carrying sleeping bags up the hill. They are all provided in the Accomodation."
60,Har har mahadev,"We 6 planned to visit Kedarnath and Badrinath along with Chopta ,Tunganath in the month of October,2019. We started discussing this programme in the month of March. After searching so many things we fixed up our date of journey on 15th October, 2019. Our journey from Kolkata to Delhi via Rajdhani Express then to Haridwar via Janshatabdi. We booked our Up and Down tickets accordingly. As per  advise of earlier visitors we have not booked any hotels or lodges. In their opinion in the month of October travellers are very less and so no need of prior booking.Lastly the most important thing was left out to select a reliable travel co from where we can hire our vehicle for  entire journey. From different corner I got name and number of several companies. From different review  I contacted few of  them but I was not fully satisfied about them,Lastly I contacted SHUBH YATRA HOLIDAYS PVT. LTD a travel Co of Hrishikesh, and talked to Navinji (9760093327,9761275227), the owner of the co which suits me in all respect. He requested me to send  mail covering details of our journey. Immediately on receipt of my mail they informed me details of charges and other terms and conditions. Our contract was from Haridwar to Haridwar. Ultimately I finalise to hire vehicle(Innova) from them and  remit a small amount as a token of advance.On 16th October they informed me the name of the driver as well as his contact no. On 16 night I contacted the driver Surajji(9760755424) and he informed that he will  reach by 8 am at our hotel.Next day we were ready and found Syrajji is already there with a New Innova.We started our journey with Suraji , a middle aged man with always smiling face.First we reached Hrishikesh and meet Navinji . a nice gentleman,in his office and  pay him some amount of money and rest will be paid after completion of journey.What I can say about Surajji. Any thing I said about Surajji it will be less about him.During entire journey he selected hotels, way side dhaba as per choice. stopped the vehicle anywhere we asked him without any question rather he helped us to visit different unknown spot.We came to know that this company replace their vehicle on every 2 to 3 years. So you can easily understand the condition of the vehicleFinally i like to say that our selection of Shubh Yatra was  very very subha for our journey. All of us very very satisfied about the service rendered by Shubh Yatra , specially Navinji and Surajji.Special Thanks to them."
61,A mystic temple,"Me and my wife walked 14 Km to Kedarnath Dham and believe me though we were completely exhausted,we got the energy back when we saw got Baba's darshan.We stayed there for 2 nights in Meerut Mandal Guest House.We got our surprise when we saw the room.The room was neat and clean.The duvet was of very good quality.The place was very family friendly and safe.The temperature was near zero and top of that rain with thunder.We eat tandoori roti and bhendi fry,we loved that.It was so cold that the roti became hard as soon as they took out of the tandoor over.Next day we devoted our whole day to visit Baba's temple.Wonderful experience.On the 3rd day we woke up and instead of walking back we took Helicopter ride for coming back.I will again go back for Baba's darshan and will stay in Meerut Mandal(Even if its full,i will sleep in the corridor).This trip was our honeymoon :) and we both will cherish this trip till the time we die.OM NAMAH SIVAYA"
62,"KEDARNATH Trip, how to Plan","Har har Mahadev. This is heavenly feeling when you stand in front of temple. All fatigue will be gone within just a second. We started from sonpryag by pony at 7 am. We already done our biometric through online before journey. Therefore no need to  do any paper work there. The road is elevated after ramvhara. We found glacier on the road. That is look like  beautiful. But  road is not smooth, its full of potty of pony. We reach kedar base camp at 2 pm and covered near about 24.5 km. More after 2.5 km walk we reach Kedar ji temple. There were huge line for darshan or puja. Minimum 4 hr have to wait for darshan. Then we decided to buy special puja ticket. It's cost about 5k for maximum 5 pax.We did our puja by 2:30 am. A pandit was dedicated to us for our puja.. After that night stay we came back by walking to sonpryag within 9 pm. Khichri is the best option for lunch which is 100/-. You also can choose maggi or alo parata @50/-."
63,Excellent place to go,"After lot of planning, we were fortunate to visit in June 2015. First thing that strikes after landing in Kedarnath is the sheer magnanimous sight of snow clad mountains. One can be awestruck for hours gazing at these peaks and wondering at galaxy of yogis who travelled to this holy place. The energy of  shiva temple reverbrates like a life within. Simply sitting on the gates of temple it can make one meditative. Tragedy may have taken toll on area around but adminstration has done coomendable job to bring this up now to such a good level. Above all, energy dimension of temple is forever,  beyond all calamities and continues to inspire devotion in pilgrims.. Wish to have darshan again and again!!"
64,Kedarnath mountain mandhir,We visited on 8th June 2019  by helicopter of Utair. We booked the helicopter on first day of opening booking online. So reaching experience was very smooth. The Darshan was taken with VIp pass of Rs 2100 each. It enables to enter directly in the temple.The pass was purchased before boarding the helicopter. The place was well managed no stampede like in Badrinath. People were aloowed to enter in queue one after another. You can touch Kedarnath Shivling and do pooja. It was very energetic experience.
65,Kedarnath,"I had the pleasure to visit Kedarnath temple twice. First time,it was 21st-22nd Oct,1985 when I toured with GMVN. It was thrilling adventure & I made an attempt to reach Chorwari Tal/Gandhi Sarovar after mesmerised by writing of Great Indian Film maker writer & intelligentia Satyajit roys' Ebar Kando Kedarnathey. It was beauty of Kedarnath village & adventure that allured me to visit again on 24th-25th Oct,2010 to celebrate silver jubilee. I was surprised that roads to Kedarnath was wider, small chattis became villages,electricity has reached Kedarnath. Small hamlets like Guptkashi was bustling with people,large shops & Phata became the base of helicopter ride. Newly built GMVN lodge was very comfortable.The temple which directly accessible was now cordoned with railings & temple was decorated with electrical lightnings.But, the adventure still remains with mighty Kedarnath peak behind, Sankaracharyya Samadhi & Mother godess temple around & not to forget adventure trekking to Chorbari Tal, river Mandakini sallying & if more adventurous trek to Vasuki Tal. I wish ti trek again to Kedarnth & Chorwari Tal & adveturists welcome. Dr Swapan Sinha."
66,Kedarnath trek,"We started off our kedarnath trek from Nainital city on motorbike. We started early morning and reached Gairsain at afternoon. After our lunch and haults at Aadibadri we reached Karnprayag by evening. We continue our drive till Guptkashi and had our night stay there. Next morning we left for Soneprayag with beautiful waterfall and Himalaya view along our way. Roads were muddy and filled with water, one has to be carefull while driving. After 2 hours drive we reacged Soneprayag where we registered for the yatra. After 5 min drive on local taxis as , no personal vehicles are allowed beyond this point, we reached Gaurikund. Trek starts from Gaurikund to kedarnath temple. Its highly exhausting and adventurous trek. One has to pass through beautiful waterfalls and views on there way. The remain of Kedarnath natural calamity still visible one you reach Rambada. One can see the washed aways remains of  landslides and the forces of nature that it witnessed. Just before the basecamp which 4 kms from Kedarnath temple, rainfall started. The weather changes very quickly at high hills. It become freezing by the time we reached Kedarnath temple at evening. After reaching our hotel we hurried ourselves for evening aarti at temple. It was Devine and beautiful. One could feel the devine presence with all those mantras chanting and sound of bells. Next morning was bliss. Clear blue sky and white Himalayas to cherish our morning. Roaming the temple primises in morning was another experience. It gave freshness to the core. Then we trekked for Bhairav mandir for Arial view of kedarnath valley. It was one of the most beautiful sights one could have. We met young sadhus meditating at top and enjoying the Devine presence. One has to go for kedarnath trek once in a lifetime to be alive and close to oneself and mother nature."
67,Holy place of lord Shiva for yoga & meditation.,"I am lucky to be there at Kedarnath and had a wonderful darshan of Jyoutriling. You can’t explain the beauty of the place in words. I have visited Kedarnath temple on 15th May, 2018.  It is one of the twelve Jyotrilings. The Siva linga is not the same as usual we see on other place. It’s quite different.  Temple is just next to Mandakini river and it is covered with snow caped mountai.  Still renovation work is going on. I would like to share my journey experience which will helpful to other.  We were looking for Helicopter but we didn’t get the ticket due to heavy demand and fewer aviators are operating. There is no online booking available for Helicopter. It’s purely based on luck or your contacts with aviator. It’s very difficult to go by Horse (pony).  There are to total five options to go to the Kedarnath Temple1.       Helicoter2.      Horse (Pony)3.      Kandi4.      Doli5.      By walk: Walking is extremely difficult as the road is not proper and very narrow.We have booked our Hotel at Sonprayag. Private vehicle goes till Sonprayag.  As we didn’t get the helicopter so we have decided to go by horse. We are total six including my parent. Horse owner will try to approach you at Sonprayag. We chose a person who has six ponies. Don’t pay money to Horse’s owner.  At Gourikund there is govt. counter where you have to pay the amount and get the receipt. The same receipt you have to give it to then horse owner once you reached at Kedarnath. Horse owner will get his money back with that receipt. It’s a good process by Govt. You can’t able to get the receipt for horse riding without your registration card. Hence make sure you have your registration card before coming to Kedarnath.  Because of this, horse owners are bound to take you till the temple. It’s better to get their ID along with you. From Sonprayag to Gaurikund (appx 5 km) only local vehicle are there with charge 20 rupees. Pony (horse) charge 2500 form Gaurikund to Kkedarnath (16km).  From Gaurikund your journey will start.  Horse riding is very difficult as there are 90% chances that you will fall from horse. In our journey four felt including me out of six. If elder are there then big no to horse.  We started at 7am from Gaurikund and reached temple at 1pm. We halted once as horse needs some rest. Be careful while sitting on Horse. Road is very narrow and steep. Road condition is also very bad for almost half of the entire road.  Once you get down from Horse you have to walk 2km to reach the temple. Normally queue is very big. As the air pressure is less, you will be in shortage of Oxygen. .  Keep Karpur while travelling which will help you in breathing.  We kept oxygen cylinder which we got from Gaurikund. You can return that in same shop if you are not using by giving rent(100 rupees). Even if same you can do for rain coat also.  We had a very nice darsan.  We stayed there near the temple (Punjab Sindh Awas). We also got a chance to see evening Aarti. At night temperature was below zero. As we came to know the difficulties in Horse riding, we tried our luck for Helicopter Sport booking for return. But no luck, even if 2hrs in queue. Then we have decided to go back by horse.  Pony charge was 1500 from Temple to Gaurikund. It was more dangerous while returning in horse. It took little less time to reach Gaurikund. We reached Sonprayag by 1pm. By that time all are tired and everybody’s back was in too much pain.Only Jio and BSNL are working fine at Kedarnath. Airtel is not working.My suggestions try your best to go by Helicopter and keep one or two days in buffer even if you got the booking in Helicopter as the weather is unpredictable at Kedarnath"
68,Heaven for every pilgrim,Visit to kedarnath is pleasant because of the faith we have in Lord Shiva and finally having the experience of being reached the destination. the visit is worst in terms of the atmosphere created due to ponies/khachar  on the way to trekking from Gauri Kund which is a 14kms trek. It is obvious ponies/khachar are required for people who can't walk but there is solution that there must be separate trek for ponies. It is impossible for people to walk with too many ponies/khachar right on the trek they are walking or some electric trolley system should be installed at the trek. It is impossible to have fresh air on the trek as there is too much smell of dung of ponies/khachar. It is not is possible to survive without mask. No good food is available on the trek. No proper shelter to stay on the trek. It is only devotion of people that is great there.
69,Extremely Holy Place,We went by helicopter to Kedarnath .It is 20 minutes walk from helipad to Temple.On the way you can see river Mandakini and Saraswati river.If you travel by helicopter you can get a special pass worth RS 2500 .You can have special darshan which takes 10 minutes.You can see bheem Shila and destroyed Shankaracharyas samadhi.It takes 2 hours including puja outside the temple.The walk to Temple is smooth with cement paving completed recently.There is a medical centre near Temple and doctors and medicines are available just outside the temple.Behind the temple the background of Sumeru and Meru hills stand magnificently.
70,Bum Bhole Baba Kedarnath ki jai,Kedarnath temple is 3000 year old temple situated at 14000 feet height.  The temp goes. In minus celcious in nights.  The temple was built by Pandvas and is a  beautiful and powerful place of Lord Shiva to visit. There is a scheduled flight operated by 9 helicopter companies from Phata helipad and it's a 10 min flight at around 7000 rupee return journey.  If you wish to save time and do char dham yatra you have plenty of charter helicopter services available from dehradun or Haridwar and they charge 4 to 5 Lac for 5 people for 4 dham yatra.  For individual seat if they have available be ready to pay out 1.25 lacs to 1.6 lacs depending on your negotiation skills. Be very careful of what agents say and promise and take every thing in written before making payments. Kedarnath you can do quick darshan by buying VIP ticket at 2500 rupee per person and 10 min you are through else it can take 4 to 8 hours depending on rush of people travelling by horse palki or by feet
71,A trip worth remembering,"I visited the kedarnath temple with my parents. i did not do much of advanced planning which was a mistake. Please book the helicopter tickets well in advance and if possible plan for sometime in june and july and august, we were there in may and the helicopter was booked well in advance 2-3 months before. please get your travellers registration cards done at the begining of the trip where the cars are not allowed anymore. also pay and if possible book your horses also in advance at the counters.We took horses and it is quite stressful journey for everyone involved. it takes around 6 hours to reach up and to go up the each horse costs you 1800 rupees. as i said it is quite busy and hectic narrow roads up the hill and half the path doesnt have railings and everyone has that one narrow road. so watchout. also bring along adequate food and water and rainjackets. usually you buy these thigns on the way but as usual its better ot have your own food with you. we started at 6 and reached the temple at 12:30 and stood in the line for 3 hours for darshan. the temple closes at 3pm and opens again at 5 pm, so if possible try to have darshan before 3. we started back at 3:30 and it started raining. As mom and dad werent happy with horses we tool dholis and i walked down. i fel down thrice in the mud on the road as its very slippery and dangerous. the dholis costed us 4000 rupees for each and it took us around 6 hours to reach gaurikund. Note the followingBOOK HELICOPTER IN ADVANCE (2-3 months) and you can avoid long queues up for the darshan as helicopter also involves VIP darshan.bring food, rain jackets, trekking shoes and good backpack.rent horses only from the public counters and not from the random people. try to start early at 4 am to avoid big rushbe careful and alert. bring a torch alogn for getting down at night, thought there are lights sometimes there is powercut :("
72,Divine experience to be there ,"Kedarnath Temple Is A Miracle Of God,After Darshana You Beel A Divine Feeling, Its A Life Time Memory For Me"
73,OM NAMAH SHIVAY,"I visited Kedarnath in June 2011. This is one of the holiest Hindu Temple in the world. This is also one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva in India. As per the Hindu mythology this tample is dedicated to the Pandavs of Mahabharta ages. When the Pandavas were going towards the Heaven after renouncing the world, they prayed Lord Shiva for appearance and Darshan and lord shiva appeared in the shape of a bull and when Bheema tried to catch him he entered into the Earth and his hump is at Kedarnath and face part is in Nepal, Kathmandu, Bhaktapur known as ""Doleshwar Mahadev-Kedar Sheesh"". it is known as Pashupatinath area. It is said that without visiting the Doleshwar Temple at Pashupatinath Area of Kathmandu-Bhaktpur, the visit to Kedarnath Temple is not completed.After Gaurikund one has to do a trekking of about 14 km to reach the temple, horse ride is available there. In the middle there is one place called Rambara for halt for sometime and refreshment and one has to stay overnight at Kedarnath and return next day. Special Pooja is organised in the temple at night in the batches of 15 minutes duration for which the booking is to be made one day advance on reaching Kedarnath.Must visit place for every Hindu."
74,Pilgrimage to Shiva's House,"Jai shiv Shankar ...Must visit once in life time . It is Holy place and one of the 12 Jyotirlingas. It is situated 223 km from Rishikesh and is 11755 feet above the sea level . Himalayan/Shivaliks are surrounding the temple and you will have a very beautiful view . It is near Mandakini river . you can feel the presence of Lord shiva and the area will definitely give you peace and blessings  . just plan properly in advance because the terrain is little bit difficult . Mainly it is open between April end to November month. It will be cold so take winter clothes along with you. Although oxygen level is ok but if you have old age family members then for precautionary take small oxygen cylinders from base area. These cylinders are not much costly . If you can afford helicopter then only go for it , it will be much more comfortable and less time consuming . Also the money difference is not much high in compare to riding on horse . Helicopter cost per person is 7000. You can take helicopter by Phatta or Guptakashi . But remember the helicopter needs to be book in advance and you have to be lucky to get tickets. Book at least one month in advance. We took early morning helicopter from Phatta and came back by 12 afternoon. You can also take VIP pass of 2100 Rs per person  to avoid the line of 1 to 2 hours and can manage to come back early. sometimes due to whether condition your helicopter may take off next day. First half of the day before 12 is normally clear than second half of the day. Tents are also available for the night stay . Jai Bholenath, Jai Shivshankar , Jai Kedarnath ..."
75,A journey to living God,"After years of yearnings, my desire fulfilled in July 2019 when I happen to finally reach Baba Kedarnath from Haridwar despite apprehension which comes in the rainy season. I started solo in the morning from Haridwar by taxi and reached Sitapuri ahead of Sonprayag where I stayed for night. In the morning started or  Gaurikund  from where took a pony - the rates for upward ride is Rs. 2300/- and downward Rs. 1500/- fixed. The ponywala left me around 1.5-2 km ahead of the Temple from where I walked on foot, though Pitthus were available for this short distance at hefty price. The view through out the journey was mesmerising esp. due to the rainy season when numerous seasonal fountains had appeared enroute.  The view at the Temple is totally enchanting. If you stay for a night, you will witness the snow clad mountains in the background changing colors with change of Sun beams. I got an accommodation   adjacent to the temple in Marwadi Awas at very reasonable price. They also took care for tea, dinner and hot water. I participated in the evening Aarti being fortunate few to be present inside the sanctum sanctorum.  I and all others who were inside were given blessings by the Head Priest. In the morning  I woke up a little earlier and had puja inside the Garbha Griha with the help of a local priest  The Temple management has however fixed charges for different rituals and one may contact their office for the same. The whole period I spent in the Temple or its vicinity was soul quenching"
76,Blissful,i have been to kedarnath thrice and each time  just being there in the lap of himalayas amidst the bells of the temple is a sublime experience. the journey upto kedarnath is itself one of lifetime
77,Kedarnath temple,We visited the Kedarnath Shrine in the end of October just as the off season was starting. There were unseasonal rains and landslides in the Rudraprayag area at the time causing some delays in our travel plans. But all was more than worth it since the inflow of pilgrims into the Kedarnath Mandir as a result was relatively low. We had an early morning darshan at the temple and had the privilege of doing the Abhishek in the sanctum itself in a thorough manner since there was NO rush at all at the time.
78,Stunning  temple.. on top of  beautiful himalayan range,"We were on the tour of chardham yatra of Uttarakhand, we reached Sitapur in the evening of 24/05/2013 and stayed at very ordinary hotel Annapurna because of over bookings of good hotels. We leave for Kedarnath early in the morning 5.00 AM of 25/05/2013 and took pony from Gauri kund and reached Kedarnath 10.30 AM. Darshan and Puja performed by us with the help of local purohit, holy experience and spiritual feelings. Returned back at 7.00PM at sitapur hotel. Hotel Shivalic and Hotel JPG Palace is a good option to stay at Sitapur"
79,Kedarnath dham,Scene is actually breath taking. Helicopter service @ Pawan Hans is super. No one can predict weather. It keeps on changing frequently.
80,The beautiful place,"we booked chardham yatra from bengaluru thru SHRI  HANSAA TRAVELS JAYANAGAR.Mr.prasad of hansa travels has immense experience to conduct this tour. he has done this flawlessly. my sincere appreciation to Mr prasad and team.we landed in Delhi for onward journey to chardham (yamunotri,gangotri, kedarnath and badrinath) yatra. we met Mr GURU and team at delhi.the bus journey from delhi was very comfortable in an airconditioned coach. after  night stay at sitapur we were taken to sersi helipad for onward journey to kedarnath. arrangements by Hansaa Were EXCELLENT. entire kedarnath temple complex has been renovated and you can have best darshan, stay and food there now.we were flown back from kedarnath and from sersi to sitapur. at sitapur we were served breakfast.there was no rush at kedarnath temple and we had darshan of mahadev to our hearts content. dont forget to have darshan of bhimshila which  has played pivotal role in protecting kedarnath temple from devastating floods of 2013.feel blessed with bliss  as you fill your heart with the darshan of  lord kedarnath. you will definitely  cry your heart out when you hug the linga of kedarnath."
81,Jai kedarnath !!,"This was the best time to visit temple. No crowd at all, it was easy to perform pooja at sanctum sanctorum of the temple. With handful of people around it was easy to had a visit to the temple. Had go around the temple and tried to re-collect memories when had visited the temple post 2013 Floods. Things have changed and are now very well managed. a lot of space around which was earlier cluttered."
82,Spiritual Divine Experience,"One of the 12 jyotirlinga temples.it is an ancient temple.we visited this gr8 place while our chardham yatra.we used helicopter ride,it was thrilling.had wonderful shivlinga darsan,n back for helicopter ride,weather was foggy,stayed in wooden cottage  maintain by govt.again we had aarti n shringar darsan,that was my wish,n it came true to stay more in temple.no words to thank my Lord in words.speechless.n thanks to military staff for helping us.really good job done by them.neat n clean place manage by them,spotless dishes for dinner,n nice food.serve by them,gave blanket to one of our yatri with out any expectation.keep it up."
83,Precautions to follow when you are on a trip to kedarnath,"12 0ctober 2018 started 18 km treaking from Gaurikund.  A spectacular view seen on the way, started at 5 am and reach at temple 11.45 am . There are God made shivling established one part hear and another part in Kathmandu Nepal namely Pashupatinath. 6 helicopter company operate from phata, sirasi, sonprayag, Dehradun, Mana etc. Can see beauty of Himalaya from here,  that day temperature only 4 degree delicious.  No word to tell more. Amazing experience for life time."
84,Great experience but challenging ,"We started our journey from Rishikesh by Tempo Traveller which is hired at Haridwar @ 7800/- per day on 17.05.18.(details ph no. and rate per day shared in photo enclosed.). however this rate may varies according to season. At Rishikesh we stayed at Jairam Annakhestra ashram. A decent ashram with neat & clean atmosphere. Decent place but for room rent one can bargain. We started our journey on 17.05.18 towards Kedarnath. Our car reaches upto sonprayag. Leaving the car on same rent i.e. 7800/- per day we reached Gourikund through Jeep @ Rs.20/- per head. In this portion no personal car permitted to go upto gourikund. If for any reason  government jeep service not available then you have to go by foot.From gourikund you can hire horse(actually Khacchar)  or Duli/Palki upto 18km at ghora stand which is 1.5 km from temple, after wards you have to go temple by foot. by.Horse - 2500 (upward) 1500 (downward) Doli - Rs.8000/- (within 60 Kg) above 60 kg -Rs.8500/-, Helicopter - 6500(Govt), 8400(private). Doli is very small Size. upward journey by Horse, downward by walk best.You can also use helicopter service which is available in different place. At Phata we took Helicopter for Kedarnath. Journey from Phata to Kedarnath is just 8 minutes by helicopterWe booked through Pinnacle Air (Amit Pinnacle Air; Mobile：094123 22968;) at Rs. 6700 per ticket both ways from their Phata helipad to go and return on the same day (17th June 2018). We booked over a month in advance but you can at times book on the same day also,depending on availability. The ride is for about 6 minutes each way."
85,"Kedarnath, lord Shivs Himalayas","I went with my family and very terrific journey, but nature is beautiful...we have started our Journey from Delhi to Dehradun by Air and then Barkot, first we visited Yamunothri and then Gangothri via Uttar kasha then we came to Rudya Prayag.  Here we stated at Hotel Tulsi and everyday morning 5 AM a paper VAN will go to son prayag which is last stop for Kedar naath.  It's 2 hours journey from Rudraprayag to Sonprayag by Van and from here we need to do trek for 16 KM.  We can take horse which is cost around 2800/- one side heli captor services like 4500 up and 2500 down. total 7500 up and down for one person.  But temple is must see temple,"
86,Memorable Spiritual Experience,"This blog is totally for traveler who are travelling with public transport and want a cost effective trip to Kedarnath Dham as i did it some day back on 20 may 2019 . I started my journey from Haridwar by taking a bus from Haridwar bus stand . One have to book ticket in advance from office outside the bus station in peak season like may June otherwise u r not going to get any seat in bus . Office Name - GOMU buses , Address - Haridwar bus stand Fare - 350 per head. Bus starts at early morning around 6 and it will take at least 10 hr to take u to Soanprayag or Sitapur both are 1km apart bus station near Kedarnath .There are several hotels near the bus stand one can take a room where ever they want but the thing is when you are going their in peak season like may June u have to pay good amt for a avg or below average rooms like i got a 4 bed room for 3000 which was not that good in off season u can get that room for under 1000 , so before going for a good night sleep one should pack a bag with some important things like some things to eat like biscuit snacks glucose energy drink what ever they need to maintain their stamina  water is not a issue just take a bottle with u and u will get so many water points to fill it up , take a extra shoes if u don't have a gum shoes take some wollen cloths like jacket, cap ,gloves etc.Next day schedule : wake up as early as possible because rout will start from 4 Am and u have to take a govt operated jeeps from Soanprayag to Gaurikund (5km) cost 20 per person  and their is very long line in peak season so it can consume your 2 hr easily if u r late in morning. Once you reach Gaurikund there are so many options to start your trekking which is 16km long to reach the Kedarnath temple so if you r planning to walk then start it if u r planning for other means then u have options like - Horses , Pitthu and Palki each have their rate according to rush their is a official government counter for horses which says it takes 2500 for one side. But if u started the track and after 3-4km u need a horse then u have to pay more because then their is no govt rate is applicable now it depends on ur bargaining capacity to get its right . Pittu charges is around 4000 one side ,Palki charges around 7000 it may vary from season to season but this is maximum one can take . There is also another option of helicopter which charges around 6-7k for round trip but it has a long waiting so one have to book it online before and reach Soanprayag on that date . Once u reach base camp in evening u will see mostly tents all along which cost u around 300-400 per bed one can take a hotel which are very less in no and are very costly too . If u r planning to take darshan in evening then temple is open till 9 so be quick and to go their quickly because people are waiting their is long line for darshan or u can rest and go to temple early morning as early as possible because their is a long line for darshan so take darshan next day and enjoy the aura of lord Shiva u can feel it ...............1. I traveled the dham n peak season so cost is little high as compae to off season 2. book your returning bus ticket from Soanprayag to Haridwar from counter in Soanprayag 3.Rain coat is necessary because rain can come any time .4.Take some important medicine like painkiller , paracetamol , high altitude sickness , bandage etc 5. There is registration process u can do online or from counter in Soanprayag and always carry a ID like Adhar or DL"
87,Kedarnath must visit,"I was in Kedarnath on 14th may  .we had taken pavan Hans helicopter from phata helipad . It was beautiful 8mins ride to Kedarnath. The place was crowded with pilgrims but the facilities for pilgrims is very basic and insufficient. Later that evening there was a heavy hail storm followed with rain and the temperature dropped to -3 degrees . Since the guest houses there are very very basic ,they did not have heaters to take care of the cold also the electricity supply was not available through the night resulting in many people freezing and feeling breathless . It is utmost important to have a good medical facility there . With Kedarnath blessings we had a good Darshan with evening puja and Aarti My advise to fellow pilgrims is to be completely equipped for cold as the weather changes very abruptly in this area ."
88,Amarnath: the holy place for Bhole baba.,This is best place to  experience spirituality aspect of Hindu religion. I cannot comment more as this more than 1000 year temple made by stones and rocks. i highly appreciate people who choose to come on foot as it checks your endurance and devotion both. i had spent more than 20 days in this valley and found this place mesmerizing. Every time when it rain in kedar valley snow fall takes place on mountain range which is in back drop of temple which looks like fresh white on coal coolour rock. Near temple there are nice facilities of stay. Apart from that one can also stay at Lincholi.
89,Kedarnath -Divinity Personified ,Must visit baba kedarnath once in life. But visit before mansoon. Don't go heart patient. When I go not much gathering and find darshan easily.
90,Kedarnath : the glory of god,"I visited Kedarnath in the month of May,it is a tough yet beautiful trek.A 17 km trek from Gauri Kund will lead to Kedarnath. Govt jeeps takes INR 20 per person from Sonprayag to drop you at Gauri Kund from where the trek starts. You need to have a bamboo stick,woolen clothes, raincoats and lots of water. A bottle Bisleri costs INR 50 on the way. The trek is steep and is meant for young people.After trekking certain Kms, if you decide to hire a horse....please note you won't get any.One can take shelter in the army camps somewhere near Lingmal(5 kms before Kedarnath) which offer sleeping bags and tents for INR 250 per person. For elderly people it is advisable to take Helicopter ride from Phata which is worth INR 7000 per person for return journey. May and June are the peak seasons when people visit Kedarnath. The government can take more initiatives to improve this trek as the services are not sufficient to match the amount of crowd. If you love trekking its worth a try."
91,Good and Worst Times,beside the natural calamity kedar faced in 2013 this shrine has some magic to be visited again. It is said that it is one of jothirlingas. it would be open only for 6 months and remaining 6 months the god would be placed in another temple in village nearby since the entire place will be covered with snow since it is at the foot of himalya. My experiance to kedarnath is awesome one we were nearly 64 on a trip. we visted on early june at that time itself it was raining. we can reach gaurikund through road and 14kms up we need to travel through petta or horse some people even walk. there is a helipad at sitapur which takes you directly near to temple. very side by flows the river mandakini with so much of density.
92,Must visit temple ,"Around 10 hrs of horseback riding, while going up to Kedarnath Temple and coming down is a sheer test of endurance. It is one of the most gruelling ride, which I could have never imaginedThe steep hill roads with deep ravines all along, is an unforgettable site. It is almost a miracle to reach back safely.As they say, only Lord grants you the courage and strength to visit him in this abode.Some suggested Do's and Dont's1) Unless you are really really fit, don't try going uphill on foot. The new route from Rambara is very steep all the way. Also the Horses and Doly pushing along the narrow road make the walking experience very difficult.2) 10 hrs of Horseback riding is very gruelling. From Rambara upwords there are no railings on the new route. While coming back on horse downhill, the horse skids a few times. It is an experience not explainable in words...3) Book Helicopter in advance. We thought we would get booking a few days earlier but it gets tricky. The middlemen/touts ask for extra money and still you can be stuck for the ride, on account of weather or other pretexts.  I saw groups which were waiting for 2+ days for their turn on helicopter ride. Waiting from Morning to evening 6 PM at the Chopper shed!4) The Doly walas are not enough and all tickets get sold out by 9 am. The only option left is horses. One Doly wala quoted me 14,000 since all tickets from Govt Doly counter were sold out.5) Try to stay one night on the top, near the Mandir. There are several accomodations which are pretty reasonable.6) We took priority darshan ticket for 1100. The Priest did an excellent Pooja.7) This Tirth like others, is worth every bit of effort. It is an amazing feeling to Pray to Lord at this Temple. While remembering all this, I feel so lucky and blessed for this rare darshan."
93,Temple visit,"Very very attractive Place, visited here with my colleagues Friends and Captured amazing moments which i never forget. Everyone should visit here again and again"
94,Chaar dhaam tour..Kedarnath temple,"i have visited this place on 29th Sept 2015, this is off season here so very less no of people are there to visit.We caught the direct bus at 4:30 AM from haridwar to Phata. reached at around 3PM there. we have already booked the pawan hans tkt online for the next day. so just below the helipad at phata we stayed at a small homestay. Biometric and medical check up is compulsury now. next day we reach at kedarnath around 9:30AM. get view at around kedarnath. very less crowded hence darsan was very good. returned on the same day by heli at around 12PM. you can also stay there at kedarnath, very good arrangemant by GMVNL amd NIM. huts and tent facilities are there . very comfotable arrangement and also a good canteen for food. after returning to base we planned for Triyunginarayan temple , take a share taxi from gourikund, 1.5hr traveeling time from gourikund taxistand  to temple.returned to phata till evening. stayed in phata and next day early morning catch the 1st bus to guptakashi at around 6 AM. reached at guptakashi at around 6:40AM. then catch a direct bus from there to gopeswar through tunganath temple route. this is the only one bus in this route. from there we got a share taxi to badrinath. reached at badrinath at around 4:30PM."
95,Kedarnath & Badrinath Yatra,its really very  beautiful and peaceful place i had ever seen in india.when we visit here we just feel like the heaven just as rid out of the soundful world. we heard about 4 dham it is one of the best place in the yatra.where it is situated in the beauty of nature is very tremandios.
96,Har Har Mahadev,"I was planning a plgrimage to Kedarnath since November'14, and after lots of planning and brain storming exploration Baba Kedarnath has fixed a trip. I have taken chopper from Phata on 11th May Monday 2015, weather was not very favourable, light drizzle has started when our chopper lifted but midway drizzle turned in to a moderate Rain. During those moments I was just chanting the name of Mahamritunjay.  After few minutes I safely landed and ambience of Kedarnath was mesmerising.  It was snow all over. Darshan was a easy going affair and with Darshan all fears and fatigue disappeared like camphor.Jai Kedar."
97,Feel Lord Shiva & Get blessed,Divine is what Sums up my visit to Kedarnath temple .Feeling so blessed with the grand location and the majestic temple. However the journey is treacherous and difficult for the uninformed.Plan well and be safe.  Involves a walk of 17 kms one way or a pony ride or a 5 mins of helicopter ride. Take ur pick.Prepare for constant change in the weather too.Get fit and get active
98,Kedarnath visit july 2018,"This place is a heaven on earth. After 14 km of trekking, you have glimpse of this old historical and religious place. No words can express the beauty of the place and surroundings. Weather is cold and rain can come at any time. at one time there is heat from sun and another moment, fog(clouds) will cover you. A must see place in India who have faith in god and also want to experience the trekking."
99,Very peaceful place!,"This is one of the Most Sacred Temples of God Shiva, as per my knowledge and belief 2nd in India after Amarnath. Further, one from 12 famous Jyotirlingas of God Shiva.Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open only between the end of April (Akshaya Tritriya) to November (Kartik Purnima). So, don't forget to carry winter cloths.To reach Kedarnath, direct buses from Rishikesh to Sonpryag early morning around 5am. Sharing Taxi available from Sonpryag to Gauri Kund. Gauri Kund is the place from where walking journey is starts. Here one can also hire Ghoda or Khachchar. Helicopter package also available from Sitapur & phata."
100,Must visit this place,"We started from Rishikesh on Monday,30th April,2018 at 7 am by a private Cab. Reached Guptakashi after having stops at Dev Prayag and Rudra Prayag  at around 2.30 pm.We had planned to go to Gaurikund and start the trekking as we could not book Helicopter ( as online bookings were not available due to some court order).Fortunately we found Helicopters were operating at Guptakashi on 30th  and it took about 10 min. to reach Kedar Nath There are variety of accomodations from Rs 500/ (sharing) to Rs 2,500/(double bed with attached bath) for one to stay at night.Temple gates open at 5am in the morning to 3 pm in the afternoon and are free of charge.We can request for Vishesh pooja which are conducted from around 2pm to 5 pm in the night. We Opted for Rudrabhishekham it being a monday night.We felt Blessed to be there.It is a Pyramid shaped Black Shila which is Auspicious and one wonders how Shankaracharya reinvented it (Legend says Pandavas built first temple).It was a miracle that Temple and Bull are intact even after deluge and the Bhim shila (now so called) which perched itself at such an place and angle diverting the flood. We returned in the morning by same Helicopter to Guptakashi. It was about 2 degree centigrade in the night . Need to carry suitable wears. We had a lovely trip to Badari Nath also. Only issue was with Private operator. We had booked on daily basis and he refused take us to Auli about 14 kms from route Badari to rishikesh on back journey. We went to Auli by Ropeway operated by GMVN. We liked it so much that we planned to stay overnight there  for two days. But  cab operator irefused to come to Auli from Joshimath just 14 kms away EVEN WHEN WE OFFERED EXTRA MONEY.He stayed at Joshimath itself. and insisted on his payment for two days. It was GANESH YATRA operated by one Mr. Vijay Verma in Haridwar. At Auli we stayed at GMVN accomodation. Officials at GMVN were very co-operative particularly Mr Ajay Diwaker and Regional Manager Mr Rawat. When they heard from me that our Cab driver was not ready to come to deliver our luggage they offered and brought my bags from Joshimath to Auli by their Car.We appreciate and thank these officials at GMVN for the co-operation extended. Our experience at GMVN Auli was excellent and we thank all the staff there. We went for a Trek  in the morning at Auli too. It took nearly 8 hours from Joshimath to Rishikesh back. Roads on the hilly terrain are narrow eventhough it is named Highway.Now extra ordinary efforts are being carried out to widen the road and for safety of Piligrims by Modi government which can be seen all through. It is little difficult when it rains as road work is ongoing. Our jouney was as planned and we felt blessed."
101,Must Visit Holy Plance,"It had been a dream of both nature lover and seeker of spiritual bliss to make Kedarnath at least once in life. The temple ensconced in the lap of ice capped mountain ranges is an experience of lifetime. Though a breezy half an hour helicopter ride will take you through, yet, it needs a walk from Gourikund or at least a pony ride of 16 long kms is necessary to savour the beauty of the place. And finally one should not leave the place without a night stay to get soaked in that spiritual kingdom of Lord Shiva ."
102,Relegious Place,"This place is open from Holi to Diwali(if my knowledge is correct). You can reach this place by a Helicopter, on a Pony or by foot. The hike is 18 KM one side. If you're to take a pony, better start off before 4:00 AM. The ride on a pony is not the most comfortable experience in the world, if you're not up to it, go by helicopter.The temple is situated at an altitude of 12K feet. It would be advisable to travel light! The ambiance around the Temple is pretty nice and you'd find a lot of devotees and travelers."
103,KEDARNATH MAHADEV MANDIR DARSAN,"The most visited pilgrim in India.The Mandir is really beautiful and the surroundings too. Carry a lot of woollens if visiting during winters. Would not recommend to travel with children in extreme cold as the wind almost freezes the body.Do register yourself for puja before going to Kedarnath ji, if you plan one.Chopper services can too be availed."
104,Pancha Kedar trek - Kedarnath the first one,We found Sitapur very clean and less crowded compared to Gaurikund.Its a matter of 15-20 min drive to Gaurikund.We enjoyed the stay there for a night before we can start our 14km trek to Kedarnath.In Gaurikund its a very BAD smell of horse dung all over the place.Me and my wife had a sigh of relief when we entered Gaurikund by thinking at-least we slept without this bad smell in Sitapur.In Gaurikund please buy plastic sheets as it may rain anytime enroute and it will become very cold as well.We had 500gm of Glucone-D and believe me it did wounder throughout the trek.
105,Kedarnathji Temple darshan,"Kedarnath has no motarable road,u have to by trekking ,pony ride  or heliride. We opted for heliride. on line booking is available for Pawans hans,. We stayed  at Guptakasi.Early mornins after a hurried breakfast we  preceded  to phata,the heliport, there your weight  is taken,Let men do not separate the couple is the saying,but depending upon  the weight couplles are separated,and put in different groups,We have to walk about a Km  from the helipad.there r men who r carrying u on the back for a fees. at punjab house u can leave your luggage,toilets availablethe presiding deity is one of the Johilinga,He is in the shape of back half of bull,u will  be blessed and return witk lot of peace"
106,one of the 12 jyotirling,It is one of the 12 Jyotirling of Shivji and situated in toughest place to visit. Considering winter season we opted to go by helicopter and pre booking was done for group. Reached 1 day before at Sersi from which helipad we have to take rude next day morning with same day return. Easy process of checkin we reached kedarnath helipad in 8-10 minutes helicopter ride. View was amazing and all mountain peaks are covered with snow. We spent 1.5 hr inside Garbhgrah for Pooja and it was amazing and no wish to go back.. We saw big stone on back of temple which has been said to be saver of temple by God Grace.
107,Pro tips - Kedar nath by helicopter,"Kedarnath is the most beautiful holy site I have visited... with helicopter services, its become quite accessible too. Go for it !"
108,Kedarnath darsan,"Kedarnath is among the 12 Jyotirling in india. Yes after 2013, Kedarnath is not the same but still beauty of nature is there, you will enjoy the nature and waterfalls on the way to Baba Kedarnath Temple.  There are 2 types of transport available to visit kedarnath temple one is Chopper & Horse/pony. You can get chopper in advance booking it will cost around 7000 -6500 from Phata. It will take 8-10 mins to reach. And for Pony need to reach Sonprayag then by Jeep to Gaurikund cost you 20INR. Then from Gaurikund you can get it, cost mainly varies according to season normal rate is 1400INR to and 1100 from Kedarnath Dham.Before starting of Journey get your registration slip done then start journey.If you are planning to walk all the way 17KM, then its nice to enjoy the beauty of nature and the waterfalls on the way to Kedarnath temple. But as per my experience its not so easy to walk to kedarnath temple, if you have trekking  habit then it will be easy for you.Its better to start from early morning and end it before evening.   On the way there are food stalls available for light foods. Kedarnath Temple opens from 6AM to 3PM and 5PM to 7.30PM. But you can do puja only from 6 to 3pm and you can touch Jyotirling within this time.There are few hotels available in kedarnath for night stay, not luxurious hotels but you can spent a night to view the amazing view of morning sunlight on ice glaciers. Till date only bsnl network is available in Kedarnath."
109,Devine and serene place,"On 30 april 2017 I have booked a seat in the only bus going up to Sontrash through  Uttarakhand transport website. I suggest to book online to avoid non availability of seat. Fare is rs 548 plus rs 10 reservation charge. The bus leaving Delhi at 9 pm and scheduled arrival at Sonprayag 10 am but no body would expect right time . So I booked a dormitory bed at GMVN Lodge at Gaurikund through GMVN web site. Dormitory bed is costing Rs 250. One can opt for room also. Very neat and clean and food also available there.I reached Sonprayag at 1130am. From there share jeep available for Rs 20 up to Gaurikund.As I went for opening day  I met Kedarnathji doli at Gaurimata temple coming from Ukhimoth where the God being worshipped during winter.I started my trekking on 2 May 2017 at 0700am and reached around 5pm at Kedarnath (I have taken much time due to my less physical stamina, generally it takes average 6 hrs). Any body having high altitude problem can meet doctor and take Diamox tablet for fast acclimatization. Rain coat and winter clothing must be carried. On the way there are rain shelter, also GMVN rest house at Bhim bali, Lincholi.I stayed at GMVN kedardom accommodation which is costing Rs 500 per bed and online booked. There are kedardom , Swargarohini situated at 500 mitra distance from temple. Base camp Nandi complex is situated at a distance of 1.5km, better to book in previous two. Also tent bed on ground with mattress and sleeping bag for Rs 250 is available for instant booking. GMVN booking is done minimum 3 days advance.Now the route to Kedarnathji is well built. Though officially written distance from Gaurikund is 16 km but it may 19-20 km. Ponno, doli pittu also available . Nowadays due to heavy rush buses may not go  up to Sonprayag. In that public may have to walk more to catch share jeep. One can take  ponny from Sonprayag also.Due technical fault I am not able to upload photo s. Interested person can check my FB for photos.Final talk :-.   nowadays Kedarnathji darshan is not that much troublesome. I went on 2012 and after disaster on 2013 route is made better and continuous work is going on. After one/ two years it will be as easy as Mata Vaishnodevi yatra.After darshan I came to back to Gaurikund and stayed night at previous ly booked GMVN hotel. Next early morning 5am took bus to Rishi kesh. Pls note that all bus starts in the early morning.Har har Mahadev.May God bless all - all everyone for the ultimate best. Tips for your tourAdvance booking of accommodation and bus will make your tour more comfortable and tension free."
110,Unmatched Experience,"We hiked the Kedarnath trail in september. 18 kilometer up with sun, 18 down with rain. The length and height is challenging and you should be trained and fit to do this. One of us quited within 1 kilometer. You can find/get a horse or carrier on the whole track. You can also go by helicopter from little towns in the area. There are little basic tents with drinks and snacks and restroom on the whole track. With rain it is not slippery but the water follows the track and waterfalls increase so you might have to go through water until you knees. The base upstairs is like a town with basic guest houses. The temple is worth visiting especially when doing an ceremony (around 500 rupees)."
111,16 km trek to kedar to pay reverence to Lord Shiva,"When you can feel the presence of lord Shiva everywhere then you have reached Kedarnath Ji temple.Getting up early at 4 am and start trekking to Kedarnath temple at 5:20 am was an expedition.32 kms return Trek to Kedarnath took me 11.5hrs(including darshan) from/to Gaurikund.The trek was a nicely built pavement with fences,many shelters, shops, public conveniences and medical rooms in-between.The route was extremely safe offering beautiful views of himalayas, jungles and waterfalls.However I found the route little difficult for old age people as the elevation is more and the trek is full of rocky terrain.And,it gets more slippery during rains.The only lesson one needs to remember to complete this journey is that one should walk slow and steady.Take small steps and avoid running.Kedarnath Temple is located in the lap of Garhwal Himalayas, some 220 kms from Rishikesh,is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva.Lying against the backdrop of the magnificent Kedarnath Range, at an altitude of 11745 ft. The nearby flowing Mandakini River, mesmerizing vistas and splendid sceneries in the form of the snow capped mountains, greenlust forests, make Kedarnath a tranquil and picturesque landscape.It is one of the most prominent pilgrimages,particularly for the Hindus.Best time to visit-September to November(until doors closed)"
112,Spiritual visit ,"its out of world experience,really divine at the foot hill of himalaya ,at the bank of mandakini, you can feel the presence of lord shiva all over here ,the only precautions to be taken is for elderly & infants,helicopter service now started is really helpful .i traveled with my parents & a infant of 15months by helicopter & was comfortable for my darshan."
113,Heavenly,Pls visit this great temple at least once and u will realise what a place this is. Stay overnight nearby in cottages at reasonable rates of around ₹1000-1500 a night incl food (off season rates only) of at GMVN resort
114,My experience in Kedarnath,"From rudraprayag we left at 5 am sharp for kedarnath 45 mins away from rudraprayg there was a landslide since it was early in the morning we were told that the landslide would not be cleared before 8 am so we took the initiative of going backwards 15 minutes up to the police station where we went and complained about the landslidethe people there were so laid back when we asked them to get some help they said when they come to know they will come in bull dozers, anyways the police guys were nice enough they told us they will try to send the help immediately, we decided to go back to the point of landslide and wait coz if we had not gone there the line of cars and buses would was increase but since it was off season not much of traffic had formed. we saw the whole procedure of the landslide being cleared and then on our way to kedarnath we had been communicating with d helicopter people there was only one company that was flying the helicopter and i was so worried because i had no choice if we wouldn't be able to take that i would not be able to go to kedarnath but god being always on my side and my positive attitude did help us a lot we reached the helipad and in 5 minutes helicopter took us from there to helipad of kedarnath. both ways d staff was so so very helpful that i even clicked their pictures, they were so kind, also since it was off season so much staff and less visitors we had the pundits coming to the helipad to ask us to come and do the pooja because it was after the flood so people being scared were hardly visiting the kedarnath. i waited for the pithu who took me on his back 1 kilo metres from the helipad to the mandir. as again it was off season and nobody there we gotto do the pooja half an hour without any disturbance only we were the people in the mandir, what else could i ask for :). it was so so amazing journey/darshan we came back to the helipad had to wait for at least half an hour as it was a break time for the helipad people but since they were worried that the sky should not lose its clarity they wanted meto take the ride first and make me reach back 2 the starting point which they did and with lot of efficiency and help. i can't thank all those people more than enough for my beautiful darshan at kedarnath. on the way we did see a lot of damages, broken houses, river side which was fully damaged, roads damaged great extent because of the floods which had happened."
115,"Kedarnath, AmazingJyotir Lingam",One of the four religious attractions of this tour. This a very religious place visited by lacs of people every year. A must visit place for religious tour and scenic beauty lovers.
116,Char dham yatra,"Every Hindu should must go there once in life time. After 2013 disaster people are afraid but now rush is increasing. Mesmerizing nature, Greens, Glaciers, tough terrain, snow laden picks, mighty Himalya, Jumping Mandakini and springs, water falls, Floura and fauna and much more. People Go to Switzerland by spending lots of dollers and Euros, I suggest they must see UTTARAKHAND as well. No words to explain. Be prepared before  journey specially physical fitness and dry food, plenty of water and tracking gears. No. fun by Helicopter Just track or use ponney.     Har-Har mahadev."
117,Heaven ☆☆☆☆☆,"We took a helicopter ride from phata (pinnacle )It costs Rs 7000/per person.It takes roughly 8 - 10 min to reach kedar mandir .It is very cold there. We stayed overnight there at Gharwal Mandal Vikas Nigam  Ltd At Rs 150/per day.6people can stay , have 2 toilets both western.The govt camps were also available at Rs50/per day but the toilets are out side. Food and warm water to drink is available."
118,Kedarnath trip on May.18,"Situated at 3848 mtrs high altitude kedarnath temple is one the 12 jyotirlings of India.Surrounded by snowy mountains one would wonder how a temple of this size built 1000 years back at this high altitude ,where we have to track 16 kms on foot still today.Although these days helicopters and pony's are there for easy movement.Lord Shiva is being worshipped here believed to be started by the panchpandavas of Mahabharata. Here the stone worshipped is believed to be the back of the bull(as Shiva transformed ).After the June 2013 flash floods whole area was destructed.The old tracking route washed away by river mandakini.But one should have gods grace ,so that he/she can visit this place.Best time to visit : September/OctoberTourist vehicles not allowed beyond sonmarg.From sonmarg ,local vehicles are available for gaurikund,which is 6 kms from sonmarg.From gaurikund you can track or ride pony to kedarnath which is 16 kms from gaurikund.helicopters are available from phata/sitapur charges are rs.3250 for one person for one side trip.for return trip they charge rs.6500(3250x2) per person.By walking you could reach the temple by 10-12 hrs.but I suggest to go by pony's(khachars) which charged around 2000 rs per person for return trip as it will take around 4 hours for upward tracking and 3 hrs for down tracking,so that you can easily complete the journey by evening.After 1.30 pm tracking is not permitted from gaurikund.Those who have money should go by chopper."
119,Adobe of Lord SIVA,"Do and Don't for Kedarnath Visitors.:- I visited there twice, once in May 2017 and then again in Oct 2018. I did the trekking with my wife and the two kids aged 12 and 8 yrs in May 2017 and went again with my father who is 80 yrs old in Oct 18 using the helicopters. I will explain all the ways in detail.You can visit there from mid April till mid Nov as the temple remains closed before and after this time due to heavy snowfall. but the best time to visit there is October. it's important to know why do I say so. For trekking or using horse you will have to leave your vehicle at Sonprayag parking. You will have to walk some 1 km from Sonprayag and then will have to join the queue to get the special (GMVL) Jeep which will take you to the Gaurikund. it's around 2.5 to 3 km from Sonprayag to Gauri kund. From Gauri kund you can do trekking for 14 km to the temple, or can use a horse one-way @1800 or palki @5000.Option 1:- If you want to use horse do the prepaid booking from Gauri kund only as you will hardly get the horses afterwards or even if you get, they will charge you much higher. In summers you need to book the prepaid horse at Gauri kund before 3 AM as they are less in numbers than the visitor's. If you starts with horse at 4 AM you will reach there by 8 or 9 AM. Get in the queue for 3 to 4 hrs max and go inside the Garvgrih to do your darshan after that come back on the same day with an another prepaid horse, and do the night halt at Gaurikund. Accommodations are available at Gauri kund or at the Kedarnath. Only few are available mid way so don't take a risk.Option 2:- If you want to walk (trekking) from Gaurikund to the Kedarnath temple it's 14 Km, it takes some 8 or 9 hrs for a non habitual to walk that 14 KM. From Gauri kund to Bhimbali is 6 Km, this 6 KM is not that steep but next 8 Kms are really difficult because of the steepness and low oxygen in the atmosphere. This 8 KM will be like 16 KM or even tougher. So walk gently and don't rush as rushing will need more oxygen which is not there. Don't feel afraid as my son did it at the age of 8 and I did it at the age of 49 ( 75 Kg) so you can also do it. I saw some hundreds of old people there, but none of them felt the need of Oxygen cylinders so need not carry or afraid. However carry some camphor to ease your breathing if is needed to only 1 of a thousand visitors. If you walk all along and if you start at 5 AM then you will reach after 3 PM at the temple. The temple closes at 3 PM after that it opens again at 4 PM but at 4PM to 8 PM you are not allowed to visit inside the Garvgrih so you can't touch the lingam nor can you pour water (Jalavishek) so you will feel a half darshan only. So need to stay near the temple at Night, and always do prepaid booking for the night halt from the GMVN sites. In summer I saw many people willing to stay there at night but the accommodation was limited. I too had to manage a person's house at double the rates which is also very limited. The nights are really very chilled so never take a risk. May June & July is heavily rushed , it takes some 2 or 3 hrs or even more in the queue in summer but it took just 30 mnts in October. it's really risky to go there after June till mid Sept because of the heavy rain and landslides. So October is the best time to visit there. Always carry a good quality rain coat as it rains more often. Option 3:- If you want to go by Helicopter then there are some 6 aviation companies which are providing the helicopter services. Helicopter services do not operate from mid July to mid Sept due to heavy rain. Every company has his own helipad. It was Rs 6800 per person both ways upto 80 KG and beyond that @150 extra for every KG. Always take the tickets in advance as it's almost impossible to get the tickets on the spot. I used the Pawanhans helicopters in 2018 from Phata. Use the direct links to book the tickets.You can also use the direct number 9899400899 ,9873155666 for Pawanhans online booking sight. It takes just 8 mint's one way. Helicopter services are available ""same day return"" and ""night halt"" both the options. For same day they allow only 2 or 3 hrs time to do the darshan but dont panic. While returning back they work on the basis of first come first serve . But have enough clothing even when you are using helicopter as the return journey may get postponed for the next day if the flying condition is not good as it happens many times due to rain. Luggage's allowed is 5 KG only. Many hotels are available at phata helipad. There is no special dress code to go inside the Gurvgrih. I didn't opt for priority darshan in either of the trips as it's a big injustice to those who can't afford. Don't try to buy the God and his boon, better pray from your own home rather than doing this injustice to the real devotees.By Shiva's boon and his call, I have visited all the 12 Jyotirlings. So for any other information if you need , you can whatsapp me at 9990318745.I will be happy to help you"
120,PRESENCE OF GOD HIMSELF AT KEDARNATH,Kedarnath is the awsome place for nature lovers and peace is in the every corner of this site.people who r in the mood of some adventures trip and with this they have to gain the blessings of shiva they must go to this place.

There is the suitable arrangement for older peoples or who are not able to walk 14 km distance.there r helicopters arrangement which they used for the temple darshan.
121,One of the Most Sacred Temples of God Shiva,"There was give of us who travelled to Kedarnath, we took the first helicopter and managed to get back by 9am. The temple is so peaceful and beautiful. It's such a calming place. I would love to visit again with my family!"
122,Blessed to have Darshan and Pooja  by Ranganath Hegde,"This was the most memorable trip of my life. The experience of my journey in Kedarnath is one of a kind. It is such that I will not forget in my life. Although being affected by the 2013 floods the place is very serene, calm and beautiful. The sunset and sunrise on the Kedarnath peak is mesmerizing. We wanted to return back on same day by heli but were fortunately stuck there. Thanks to the fog as I could attend the evening aarti, go to baba bharionath, see the sunrise and sunset, experience the flow of mandakini river. This place was just like a paradise for me. Looking forward to visit the temple again."
123,Blissful,"Kedarnath is temple of Lord Shiva and one of 12 Jyotirlinga. After heart attack in April, 2013, I decided to get blessing of 12 Jyotirlinga, 2nd time and from August, 2013 to April, 2014 visited 11 Jyotirlinga with Pashupatinath, Kathmandu but could not visit this holy place due to disaster of Kedarnath in 2013. From Phata HELICOPTER service is available and Helicopter takes only 8 minutes to cross 30 km walking distance from Phata to Kedarnath Temple. At last with mercy of Lord Shiva I got blessing of Lord Kedarnath and fulfill ""SANKALP"" of visiting 12 Jyotirlinga. I also got chance of Abhisek inside temple. DO VISIT."
124,Just pure and Blessed..,"Did it on 29 May 2016.  I guess everybody knows about Kedarnath.....where it is....how to go there.....where to stay.....what to take......options to be there.......Well, we were 3 people in our early 30s and we did it on foot.........took a long time from 4:30 a.m. to 3:30 to do the darshan.......but it was worth it...No sort of a miracle for a temple to be there in those harsh conditions built in ancient times.......Trekking to be there is not easy, I never did such an arduous journey until now....you wont see the temple until you are in the vicinity of 2 km of the temple......never seen such an unpredictable weather.....at approximately 3500 meters few people may have problems with oxygen........We had to take mules on our way back because we wanted to get down the same day.....and we got down around 8:30 p.m., stayed at the same hotel in Gauri Kund (Sunil Lodge) and left for Haridwar at 5:30 in morning.....Everything went well........I would say better than we had planned....."
125,Wonderful temple,"""Om Namah Sivaha"" echoes in vehicles through valley to trek as one starts the journey to Baba Kedarnath's Abode.How:Post massive flood, the trek route is now more, 24km. So physically fitness is a must to trek at around 12000 feet above sea level. There are numerous helicopter rides available from various places just before Gaurikund, which takes around Rs 8500/- pp round trip. Though the one way ride itself takes 5 min, the wait in queue in long at chill winds makes it longer.When:The shrine opens on Akshaya Tritiya day and closes post Deepawali every year, i.e from May till October before the onset of harsh winter. The rainy season in-between should be avoided due to landslides. The best time to visit is between June, after the initial rush and just before the onset of rains.What:Kedarnath shrine is believed to be from the times of Adi Shankaracharya in documented history, though references to it are there in very ancient scriptures. Legends has is that Pandavs created the shrine in honour of Lord Shiva who got them rid of their sins in the great war. Considered one of the 12 sacred Jyotirlings, one can actually touch and apply butter to it with devotion.Nearby Shankaracharya samadhi is now washes away post flood, though makeshift arrangements are there."
126,Wonderful mandir,"This holy place is situated in Uttarakhandm 14kms trek from Gauri kund. the roads are extremely difficult, please ensure yu have made bookings in one of the hotels near the temple coz if you wish to be back on the same day, you would not enjoy the beautiful surroundings of Kedarnath. there are multiple ways of reaching here, by walk, by horses, by Palki(Four people carry you on a seat) and the best one is by helicopter.I would always suggest the walk if you can coz the way to the temple from gauri kund is sheer beauty of nature, small water falls, river flowing alongside and many beautiful scenic views throughout.A beautiful holy temple of lord shiva in the amazing valley, which can only be experienced coz every beautiful word falls short against its beauty."
127,Must Visit Place,Kedarnath is recovering from the 2013 natural disaster. Sad to see the old path but the government has done a good job on the recovery path. It is humbling to see people's faith as they trudge up the path wearing little warm clothing without any complaints.
128,Excellent place to visit at least once in a lifetime,Kedarnath is the last one and the hardest destination to reach in Chardhm Yatra. Here high altitude and atmospheric pressure creates lots of problems for pilgrims. So its advisable book helicopter for Kedarnath Yatra to make it possible for your family.
129,Kedarnath temple ,must visit for every one atleast oneI had visited this place about 25 years back and it was just paradise
130,Kedarnath ji dham Yatra :),"Brilliant darshan, brilliant puja and very lucky to be alvie, was there on teh 14 June just before the Tsunami"
131,Tough trek-divine darshan,"We went here before the deluge that almost destroyed this temple. However good to see that Kedarnath jee still holds his firm ground. If you are the adventurous ones, you can take a small trek from the path that normally leads to the mandir and make it to the afternoon arti."
132,Kedanath(A place of dangerous miracles),"One of the best scenic & holy place of India.  Adventureous yatra one should not miss. From Gourikund, U can reach horse & pony. Charges varies according to rush. Horses can be hired from RS 500 to 5000. Palki RS 2500 to 6000.Various Helicopters ply from Gupt Kashi/Phata & Sersa. Charges from RS 6500 to 7500 per person. Better to book on advance. The services may be cancelled @ any time during to weather. Some of Help services also provide Kedar Prasad for Rs 250.It look likes here as Lord Shiva standing in Kailas if snow is surrounded in the back hills of this temple. It is mesmerizing experience."
133,Baba kedar,Feeling lucky to visit this place. It was really divine experience to see this ancient temple at the bank of river Mandakini.
134,Kedarnath mandir in 2017 october,Kedarnath ji is a Devine place...the trek is little bit difficult .we climbed with pony but come down by foot only.. Don't miss arti ..best accommodation is swargrohini.. booked through gmvn..pony takes till  stand then there is 2 km walking distance till Temple ..due to high altitude level of oxygen is low so carrry sugary substances glucose chocolates n take water regularly . after reaching everything is normal but while walking near to the temple little bit breathless takes place.carry rain suit.. weather is unpredictable..carry caps warm jacket.. gloves.
135,Jai Bhole Baba,"sotc gave local contract to gauri travels headed by Akash Sharma of Haridwar who has made tour mismanged, We booked do dham with Helicopter and paid 100% advance but our money was not given to Helicopter agency by Akash sharma of Gauri travels and had to purchase tickets with great difficulty by waisting 2 days in cash which made our futher tour impossible to continue bcos of which we could not do badrinath darshan and rishikesh water rafting also. We did not expected this  from SOTC"
136,Road from Sonprayag to Kedarnath,"Plan to stay for the night so ha you an see the deity in different forms.Temple opens around 630 am. You can see the shivling, touch it and do pooja until 3 pm. You get to see the true shape and form of the shivling. Temple closes at  3 pm and reopens at 5pm. Now no more people doing pooja. You can see the decorated shivling (not the true form) from the sabhamantap. That is a sight to see as well.Now, also, please witness the evening aarti : 7pm to 8 pm : as well. The rituals of the chief priest, the clanging of bells by devotees, the playing of damrus by the Babas that are present everywhere, the snowclad meru, sumeru, Vijay, vikram and kedarnath peaks slowly fading into the darkness : all add to the divine experience. Negotiate beforehand with the pandits if you engage them for pooja. Dont end up footing a big dakshina afterwards."
137,A Divine Experience,"A beautiful place so engrossing, I could feel presence of Lord Siva. Very cold place, go with enough warm cloths.  If you decide to walk 14 km take rain coat also."
138,Very good facilities,"This temple is consider one of the most important Shiva temple of India. You need to trek / horse ride / piggy bank or take chopper ride of vertical 16 kms to reach here although views are as good as heaven en-route still people take such hardship to reach here by battering snow, rain and cold. So you can judge peoples unshakable faith in this temple. Temple was built many centuries ago and still it is in remarkable shape in spite battling cloudburst in 2013 so it is consider as miracle. Temple complex is large with many commercial activities happening 24 x 7. People queue up very early in the morning sometimes from middle of the night so heavy rush always persists. Temple is open only 6 months a year it gets shut down from beginning of winter and reopens on summer starting.I feel this is matter of faith above all."
139,Jai Bholenath Jai Kedarnath ,"Very Holy and scenic place, hotels and camps both are good to reside here. Woolen clothes and raincoat are compulsory to carry. Going by walking is preferable. It is 17 km from gaurikund. Carrying one oxygen cylinder ( just of size of room freshner) is advisable per  4-5 peoples group. It can be obtained from sonprayag and can be returned if not used."
140,Religious ,"i visit temple every year, from last 6 years, in May. There is facility to stay over night also, @GVMN at very nominal rate.But the New Road from Bhimbali,to Shri kedarnath  is very difficult and full of Glaciers. only 2 G BSNL works and nothing else.Shree kedarnath is no more a Picnic spot at 10000 ft ,as very nominal facilities being provided by Government , so only Nature loving Pilgrimage being advised to take accent.Helicopters in peak season runs whole day, many , does not have online booking, but done on the spot.All the cars are now stopped at Guptkashi, and than only Jeep carry tourist to Gourikund."
141,Ohh..!!,"The great temple is at Uttarakhand India is at 16 km trekking distance from Gaurikund. After 2013 disaster the new trekking path made. Any body can trek, avail point, doli or pitch. Nowadays gustong Kedarnathji is not much trouble some"
142,Baba Kedarnath at Top,We started our journey from Haridwar. At Haridwar we stayed at Sachin International Hotel opposite Railway Station. Decent hotel but for room rent one can bargain. We booked a taxi from Gangotri Travels Railway Road. A decent and very reasonable & fixed rate. We started from Haridwar around 9 AM for Phata and reached there at 6 PM. On the way we stopped at Devprayag and Rudraprayag.From Phata we took Helicopter for Kedarnath. Journey from Phata to Kedarnath is just 8 minutes by helicopter
143,Har har mahadev,"helicopter services are prompt, i suggest you to not chose PAWAN HANS as we faced a big problem they cancelled our flight with no reason and they made their phone on switch off mode. while other companies were doing great job."
144,KEDARNATH TEMPLE-Har Har Mahadev-Om namaha Shivaya,"I went to Kedarnath ji on 13th june by self drive.We had taken a Innova crysta automatic (The best decision I had taken) from Delhi.I was told that it is better to take a small car for the hills,but the Innova was too comfortable,especially for the automatic gear shift.As we were two drivers (my brother in law & me) we could drive directly from Mayur vihar, Delhi to Jankichatti on the same day.Next morning we trekked upto Yamunotri (about 5 km from Jankichatti).After darshan & bath in the hot spring we returned for our night halt at Uttarkashi.In the evening we had darshan at the Kashi Vishwanath temple.Next morning we drove to Gangotri. Had a brief halt at the picturesque village Harshil & the hotspring of Gangnani.After a dip in the ferocious Bhagirathi & darshan at the Gangotri temple we went back to Uttarkashi for the night halt at GMVN.Drove to Sonprayag next day & parked the car there (Cars are not allowed beyond sonprayag). We took a private taxi to Gaurikund GMVN for night stay.Next morning we trekked upto Kedarnathji.It took us about 7 hours to reach there.The view of the temple with the majestic snow clad Meru & Sumeru peaks is amazing.The temple closes at 5.00pm & we reached at 4;45 Pm.The priest who took us for darshan was a gem of a person & guided us through the temple.Due to time constraint we could not visit Bhairabhnathji & returned by trekking to Gaurikund GMVN. Overall experience was beyond imagination.Please prepare yourself physically & mentally before undertaking the trek.Though we trekked the whole distance on the same day it is advisable to go for night halt at Kedarnathji & do the early morning pooja & return.Please avoid travelling after sunset."
145,Kedar Yatra,"Kedarnath temple at an altitude of 3600 feet is around 220 km from Hrishikesh,& 58 km from Gupta Kashi ,Utarkand state.Inside the temple one of the 12 Jyothirlingas of Lord Shiva installed.It is reported that  Temple is built by SriAdi Shankaracharya.On 13 th June 2017,from Guptakashi Helipad we reached Kedarnath (58 kms ) within 6-8 minutes  helicopter ride..Beautiful mountains,green scenary &  Sri Kedarnath temple view from Helicopter was  amazing.Photography not allowed inside temple & Helicopter.from Helipad,we walked around 200 feet to reach Mandakini river.River water flow is beautiful to watch.Further we walked around 200 feet to reach Kedarnath temple.on the way Pooja material shops,canteens & wash rooms are available.We are able to get Bilva patra leaves in only one shop,which is sacred for Jyothir Linga Kedareshwar pooja.. Long queue was there for common Darshan .We entered temple through Special darshan ticket (VIP) .SRI KEDARNATH Pooja was done through Poojars available inside temple. Devotees can also pour river water ,Ghee,Honey ,Bilva patra on sacred Linga & allowed touch.Inner walls of the temple sanctum are adorned with figures of various Deities & scenes from Mythology. Outside the temple a statue of Nandi Bull stands as Guard.Around 12=30 pm,it was sunny & at 2=00pm suddenly rain started  and climate was very cold .Always better to wear Heavy wollen jackets.Kedarnath ,one of the sacred shrines of Chardham,also called Sacred staircase to Moksha.Cascading Mandakini river,images of beautiful landscapes & snow dropped HIMALAYAS make Kedarnath a tranquil place splendid scenary."
146,One of the most divine experience on can imagine,"Kedharnath and the Himalaya is a very very beautiful place. I don't have any words to explain the natural beauty which I've gone through during sunrise in the early morning. Himalaya was glittering on the top and whole place was very amazing, I wish i could travel every year to this place to make my chance to mingle with nature in every possible way i can do.I am Solo traveler and I visited this place on October'14, all the plans were suddenly without any pre-plan.I made my travel alone using public transport like Buses and Jeeps and some local transport to reach till Sonprayag. From there I started walking almost 22 Kms to reach the Temple.Trust me it was my very first experience with Nature were no pollution and the nature is still nature. few changes you will see are the walking road, Power lines and shops and some accommodations buildings rest all is full of nature as it is.A very wonderful experience that i wish every one must go though. Friends I wish you all the best witness the same.Avoid destructing nature and pl preserve the nature as it is"
147,The place is amazing,"After a wait of years ... I was fortunate to visit the shrine of Kedarnath Baba not once but twice this month. Despite the 2013 disaster wreaking havoc around the temple, there surely is an energy which draws thousands to the temple. Located in a remote valley in Uttarakhand, getting to the temple involves a road journey along the Mandakini river to the road head which is at Gaurikund followed by a 22km trek to the temple. For those that do not have the time to trek or find it difficult to undertake it, there are at least ten helicopter operators that ferry you in to walking distance of the temple (just 5-10 minutes). The starting helipads are dispersed from Guptkashi to Sitapur with the ride times from 9 minutes to 5 minutes respectively at a cost of Rs 7000/= per return journey. One can also stay the night at Kedarnath in tented accommodation or cottages next to Kedarnath helipad."
148,Kedharnath Dham,"After a lot of planning for months, we were able to visit the Kedarnath Temple, holiest of the holy places, on June 20th, 2015. At times due to the inclement weather and helicopter issues, it seemed like we wouldn't be able to make it. But by God's grace we reached the temple just 5 minutes before the temple was about to close at 3:00 pm. Since we were the last ones in the temple, the priest spend a lot of time with us in performing the puja. We were very satisfied with the puja that the priest performed. Best thing was that we were allowed to touch the Shiv Linga and do the puja ourselves which is not very common in other holy shrines in India. The temple is about 10 mins walk from the helipad. It seems the place near the temple was crowded with shops and hotels before but all of those have been washed away in the deluge of 2013.  Now there are a few small shops that sells puja items. The area is very peaceful. The view of the snow capped mountain peaks and the flowing Mandakini river is mind blowing. After our darshan, we had lunch in the cafeteria managed by the temple authorities. Very nice and clean cafeteria serving lunch at a nominal price of Rs.70. The toilets were also very clean. Now few important points to consider: 1. The helicopter companies usually will try to sell the Special Darshan ticket for Rs.1100 per person, but that is not really mandatory. Our driver had advised us to not buy the Special Darshan ticket as there is not that much crowd these days. So we did not buy the special darshan ticket and I am glad that we did not buy it. There was hardly any crowd when we visited the temple. Instead of buying the ticket from the helicopter company, I would like to suggest all visitors to buy the Special Darshan ticket from the ticket counter at the Kedarnath Temple (near the Kedarnath helipad) once you reach there only if you see a lot of crowd. 2. Please note that the temple remains closed from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm daily for cleaning and bhog. After 5:00 pm, visitors can do the darshan but are not allowed to touch the diety. 3. There are pitthu / dolies available for people who may find it difficult to walk to the temple from the helipad. We had availed their services for a member in our group. The cost was Rs. 100 for one way."
149,Awesome mind-blowing experience,As it was rainy season Helicopter service is not available. We left early from our resort and reached Sonprayag by 0730. We took private taxi to reach Gaurikund.We hired Pony 4500/= to and from and Palki 8500/= for ladies.It is almost 16.5 KM and journey is good.We could have walked also.Reached your 1230 Hrs and waited for Palkins.Finally we reached temple by 1430 Hrs.As there was no rush our group of 12 were doing for 20 mts.Left 1530 and reached Gaurikund by 1930
150,Divine place,"A visit to this divine place is nothing short of a heavenly experience. We had decided to trek the entire 19 km route from Gaurikund and it was one of the best experiences of my life. We kind of experienced 3 different weather patterns during our climb from bright sunshine to rains in the middle to the falling snow as we went further up. The route has changed since the deluge in 2013 and is longer than the previous route, No amount of words can describe the  feeling when you reach the peak and witness the grandeur of the temple. Simply put it is one a must place to visit."
151,Tough yet beautiful trek,"Kedarnath is an amazing place though much of it was destroyed in the floods that ravaged the place in 2013.  Yet, the government and the Shrine board have done well and the darshan is quite well organized.  basic hotels are available as also basic things to eat, etc.  Do not expect anything fancy.  The path from the helipad to the mandir is well paved and so it was not difficult."
152,"Dirty trek route, crowded, commercialized","Now a days Photometric registration is must and is  being done at Guptakashi. One should carry Photo identity card such as Voter card/Passport etc. Also medical check up is being done here. Mode of journey (trekking/Pony /Helicopter) to Kedarnath will be advised  by the Doctors stationed at Guptakashi based on medical report. Kedarnath after 2013 devastation is approachable by  a new trekking route developed by the Govt. of Uttarakhand,17KM approx. from Gaurikund. At Bhimbali ,Pilgrims/tourist has to cross the mighty river Mandakini.The new road starts here and  is very very stiff with high gradient. Proper trekking accessories is required alongwith a light rain coat which  is must.We faced torrential rain in this terrain.Lodging/refreshment facility has been provided through out the route at Jungle Chatti,Bhimbali,Chhoti & Bari Lincholi etc.Ponies/portars/dandies are avilable.However,one should hire pony at Sone Prayag at Govt. approved rate of Rs.1800/- per person (one side).Now a days ,vehicles to be parked at Sone prayag . Because from Sone prayag to Gaurikund road is totally damaged and is under construction and only ferry vehicles are available that too for a limited period through out the day(6-9am & 5-7pm ). Practically speaking ,trekking  starts from Sone Prayag at present from where Gaurikund is a distance of another 5-6 km.However, the arrangements made by Govt. of Uttarakhand at Kedarnath for Lodging/fooding etc. is excellent.Also Helicopter services operated by 3-4 service providers from Phata/Guptakashi is superb. Due to very less tourists turnout, bargaining is going on helicopter fare.The Journey was very very peaceful and I enjoyed the wonderful scenic view through out the trekking route.Finally, I should quote one line from Sri Sri Paramahansa Yogananda Ji for this spiritual journey which  I feel......"""""" Peace flows through my heart, and blows through me as a zephyr.Peace fills me like a fragnance.Peace runs through me like rays......."""""""""""""""""
153,Awesome experience .... Lifetime ,"We (a family of three senior citizens, two adults and our ten year old son) did the Yatra on 08 October 14. we drove from Dehradun to Badasu(near Guptkashi) which is a ten hour drive via Srinagar and rudraprayag. Badasu is short of Gaurikund and Sonprayag from where the trek to Kedarnath starts. the ponies have to be hired from Sonprayag and registration with GMVN has to be done at the same place. As of n is being reconstructed till Gaurikund. A local jeep (max) is also available on hire for this part of the journey.The ponies are available from Sonprayag itself or can be mounted from Gaurikund. The walk which was 14 kilometre is now almost 22 kilometre along the River Mandakini. The route is ok, even though the weather is unpredictable at times and a waterproof is advisable.it takes around six hours to reach the top and you will see signs of destruction all through the route.GMVN and Army is in the process of reconstructing the place and it will take at least one odd year for life to come back to normal. The biometric registartion at Sonprayag ensures that ll movement of personnel is registered.Stay at Kedarnath is either in tents or limited rooms which need to be booked in advance. If accomodation is a problem, it is suggested that you halt at Limcholi which is five km before Kedarnath. At the GMVN stalls enroute, food and hot tea is free and the staff is very helpful.At the temple site, large number of priests will meet you if you are interested in a Puja. else depend on your general sense of direction.I had to get back the senior citizens in helicopter and walk back with rest as they were tired after the pony ride. Overall, the place is serene and tranquil and still limping back to normalcy. I would suggest that you plan for a three day trip if you are walking or a one day trip if you are taking helicopter from Guptkashi/Phata/Badasu (shersi)."
154,Har har mahadev,"Took a helicopter from Sitapur to Kedarnath. The ride was awesome. Came back next day walking as the helicopter was cancelled. The Darshan was excellent. If possible do stay a night to view the early morning sunrays on the Himalayas . This was my first visit and if possible will do another visit, avoid May-June and travel during September October when it will be less crowded."
155,Lord siva temple,"This temple is quite famous and beautiful. Now-a-days people have to go there by helicopter which takes time only 5 minutes, but cost is Rs. 6800/-. That place is situated at quite high altitude and temp. is very low. If you are lucky, you can see snow fall also sometime. Lord Shiva is there."
156,Kedar - Badri Pilgrimage from Bangalore,"It's my 10th visit to this divine place. Every time returned with inner happiness, full of energy. After 2013 June's natural disaster, flood now reconstruction work almost completed journey is safe with better facilities. This year pilgrimage  break all records with highest number of pilgrims visited the temple. If you're fit and have time Stay there for night or plan your journey for opening ceremony with Doli proceedings from Gaurikund to Kedarnath it's unforgettable experience."
157,KEDARNATH Must Read before planning,"I decided to travel to Kedarnath on an impulse decision. I just took of with no plans at all and alone. The trek to the temple was hard, but worth every bit of energy spent. words cannot describe the view. The lush green meadows were dotted with snow and ice. Accompanying me was the gushing Mandakini river smashing on the rocks with bone crushing force.  Finally after an epic 5 hour and 15 minutes trek, I arrived at Kedarnath Temple. Even if you are not a devotee, this is one place that you should visit."
158,Had har mahadev,"Just returned back to Pune from Uttarakhand family trip.To brief about our Kedarnath trek - My family of two adult & two kids wanted to experience first day darshan & witness climate around before the crowd could neturalise it. Accordingly we had planned our Uttarakhand family trip. Reached Dehradun from Pune by flight. Started with Mussorie, Rishikesh & finally Haridwar before proceeding to Guptkashi for Kedarnath trek. We had hired Innvoa & started from Haridwar by 8:00am on 7th May. Reached GMVN TRH Guptkashi by 4:00pm for night stay. It's a decent option to stay for a night before the trek. Also Viswanath temple is at a walking distance & it's a good option to visit in the evening before dinner. As Kedarnath temple was planned to open on 9th May morning 5:30am hence we started trekking on 8th May along with Kedarnath doli (Palkhi) which starts from Gaurikund. To be specific we started from GMVN Guptkashi at around 7:00am leaving our main luggage at the GMVN hotel reception. Reached Sonprayag at 8:00am, did some formalities related to biometric registration & moved on to Gaurikund using local Jeeps. For biometric registration pl. note you need to carry you Aadhaar card xerox or photocopy - it's important & there are many registration centres hence need not panic. Usually the Kedarnath Doli starts from Gaurikund mandir 8:30am after a formal puja (arrati). We had a opportunity of attending the puja. The trek route was not very crowded as the Kedarnath temple gates were yet to be opened next day early morning hence it was good to move on by enjoying the nature around. Even Helicopter Service was not started due to some court orders but then it was started a week later. The entire trek route moves along Mandakini river which originates from the Kedarnath glacier, some 7-9kms upwards from Kedarnath temple. Initially half way till Bhimbali trek route is on the left side of the river & then in between we cross a steel bridge & trek route moves to right side of the river till the end.We started trek from Gaurikund at 8:30. Roughly it's a trek of 16-17kms & was estimated to take 7hrs but being a family with two kids, we practically took eight & half hours. It's really long & needs some patience's & stamina. We reached the Kedarnath GMVN base camp by 5:00pm where we had booked our stay with GMVN cottages. During the trek our main stops in between were Jungle Chatti which is 4.5kms from Sonprayag. This was our first snacks & cold drinks stop. Then second was Bheembali which is at 8kms & is almost at half point or slightly before. It's a easier trek till Bheembali but once you cross the steel bridge built over river Mandakini towards the right side, the climb elevation increase making it slightly tougher. Our third stop over was at Big Lincholi at 11.5kms for a lunch break at around 1:00pm. Unfortunately when we went there were Not many options available as it was too early to expect. Many of the stalls were being still erected or material was yet to arrive hence only option left was alu paratha or maggi with some tea & biscuits - not beyond. After lunch kids got slightly lazy making the climb tougher. Also temperatures started dropping from earlier 15 degrees at Gaurikund to 4 or 5 degrees as we were close to Base camp. Finally reached GMVN base camp around 5:00pm with immediate check in & some rest till evening. Again got up by 7:00pm but by then the temperatures had dropped to almost 1 or 2 degree. Took our dinner at the GMVN basecamp itself by 8:00pm. For dinner only option was a north Indian rice plate, neither can expect much. After dinner went for temple darshan which is another 1.5kms from the base camp. Entire trek road from base camp to temple is well lighten by street lights. Temple was still closed from front with very few people around. During mid night temperatures dropped down to -2 degrees with chilling winds; We really had to struggle to keep ourselves warm.As temple was planned to open on next day early morning at 5:30am (9th May), we again reached back by 5:00am to witness the opening ceremony. It was great to be a part of this religious event. Being a first day it was easier to get the darshan within a hour or so. We packed everything & started down by 7:00am. Finally reached Gaurikund by 12:30pm in the afternoon & then onwards GMVN Guptkashi by 2:00pm. Local jeeps are available from Gaurikund to Sonprayag & then onwards our own Innova was waiting in Govt. designated parking. Also climb down was easy hence reached down within 5 & half hour compared to 8 & half for trekking upwards. It was a great experience to cherish the memories for long time."
159,"Awesome,Adventurous & at times its Dangerous too but beautiful-Har Har Mahadev","Journey start : 1st June 19 from DelhiSonprayag the start point of the Kedarnath ji at a distance of about 440 kms is best accessible from delhi by bus. Took the bus from ISBT Kashmere Gate at 10.30pm night to Augustmuni. Alternately you can take the bus to Rudraprayag or Guptkashi which are nearest points to Sonprayag . Bus fare is INR 550/- ordinary bus.  Expect a delay of 2-3 hours normally or upto 6-7 hrs in case of heavy jam. 2nd June'19 : Augustmuni @ 12.00noonReached Augustmuni at 12.00noon and after visiting the Augustmuni Mandir took the bus at 12.40pm to Sonprayag a distance of 50 kms. this journey took 7 hours and I reached Sonprayag at 8.00pm night. shops change over to dormitory with bed roll and blanket @ INR 300/- per person. Due to heavy rush please be ready that these might not be available so I slept at a tea-stall @ INR 150/-. Hotels are expensive and not equipped being a seasonal type of business.2nd June'19 : Sonprayag : 8.00pmFood is available at INR 100/- per thali and is good quantity. Taste wise do not be finicky. if you reach by 5pm please get the Yatra registration done else you can do this in the morning 5am as I did. it takes 45 min to 1 hr for the registration. the queue for the  Jeep ride from Sonprayag to Gaurikund is long and the wait time is anywhere from 2 to 3 hours. So please be prepared. Yatris who are willing to go for Yatra on mules please book from Sonprayag @ INR 2500/- per person and this will help to  advance you from the long Jeep queue. it takes 15 min. and INR 20/- to reach Gaurikund which is at 6 kms from Sonprayag.3rd June'19 : Gaurikund : 9.50amI started the yatra from Gaurikund at 9.50am. Suggest that you sit and rest for 4-5 mins after every 2-3 kms trek. the trek distance is about 20 kms from Gaurikund after the new route has come up. Not adequate amenities are there on-route but Yatris can manage by sitting at the hillside and water-points available every 2-3 kms. Tea @ INR  20/-, Maggi @ INR 50/- and Paratha @ INR 50/- are only available. Essential to carry rain-coat and small back-pack for the journey as the weather changes rapidly.3rd June'19 : Kedarnathji Mandir : 9.45pmReached Kedarnathji Mandir at 9.45pm and had darshan at 10.30pm. So please go to the Mandir and have a evening darshan when you reach the Mandir. the queue was shorter and it took 10 mins for a good darshan. in this darshan Yatris are not allowed in the Sanctum and the Shivlig is in Raj-Bhesh.After Darshan had langar at Prarthana Bhavan and you will get a place to sit at night. Hotels were all booked so last minute planners please be ready to go with the flow. 4th June'19 : Kedarnathji : 4amFor the Morning Darshan it is best to get ready by 3am and stand in queue. After taking bath when I joined the queue at 4am,  it was already 1 km long. As there is not much check-point sand police so there are people who keeps sneaking in the line. this needs better management. Also due to special puja allowed by the Temple pandits the waiting time gets more. So there are pilgrims who return without darshan.After 3 hours I had darshan and also offer water to Shivling. Divine moment. It was a moment that takes away all the tiredness. then started the journey back to Gaurikund and I was there by 2.30pm which is 6 1/2 hr trek. After 2 hours queue took the vehicle back to the Sonprayag.4th June'19 : Sonprayag : 4.45pmThere s no public transport available after 7 am from Sonprayag to other places. thus the best thing is to get some negotiation with the local jeeps and head out of Sonprayag to places like Guptkashi and Rudraprayag as these places have better facilities like hotels and restaurants and also in the morning these places offer better opportunities to reach places like Haridwar and Rishikesh for the onward journey.4th June'19 : Rudraprayag : 11.00pmStayed at River View Hotel and had tasty food @ INR 90/- per thali and got dormitory bed @ INR 400/-. this is the 1st time I got charging point to charge my mobile.

If you book helicopter then best place to stay is the helipad area or Guptkashi which is easily accessible from these areas. For the Yatris who are going through Sonprayag, to avoid the 5-6 hours jam advise you to walk from sitapur which is 2-3 kms away and will take maximum 30 mins to walk.Please carry adhaar card, medicine, rain coat, power-back, torchJai Baba Kedarnath"
160,Adventurous and at times dangerous trekking involved and please do advanced planning,"It is not fun, it is reality. Thirty years ago I could not  get the Darshan of the Lord Kedarnath, one of the twelve ""Jyotirlingas of Kedar of Lord Shiva due to the sickness of my friend's wife.There after many changes happened. But I always cherished the desire to have a glimpse of Lord Kedarnath located at a height of 3584mt. In June, 2013, I decided to go for which I took preliminary preparation. What man proposes, god disposes. Now everybody knows what happened in Kedar valley on 17 th June,2013. The nature's fury took lives of thousands of people.I believe in God, though I can not see them but I feel the presence when I see the nature, alive. Now I am 70years old, initially I feel fear in my mind of going alone, just with my wife (61years) but I tried to find a like minded couple as companion but never got.Then I tried to go alone with a lot of preparation from 2-3 months earlier.I follow my own itinerary. So this year I was determined to visit Kedarnath followed by Deoriatal, Tunganath, Chopta, Badrinath etc in one go. This time my long cherished desire is fulfilled. I do believe that there is some power that make you come out with flying colours.I gather a lot of information for Kedarnath Yatra after the disaster. Two years have passed since then but the Government is trying its best to make the going easy & comfortable.There are many options-trekking on your own feet, Pony, Dandies,Pitthus, and the last is Helicopter service.Why Kedarnath is so amazing to all ? You will enjoy the snow-covered peaks of Kedarnath (22769ft) and Kedardome (22411ft). Kedar valley is very cold as the snowline in Kedar is very near to the 2km long and 500 mt wide valley.Considering our age and 17 km trekking either by pony or dandies, we decided to avail the service by helicopter  run by Pawan Hans Helicopters Limited, A govt of India Undertaking with its HO at New Delhi. The service is available from Augustmuni & Phata (01364-265325)[ Contact Mr. Anil, Manager at this number) for any help.We made a spot booking @Rs.7000/ each for both ways tour. We started our journey from Rishikesh>Shivpuri>Kaudyala>Vyassi >Devprayaga> Kirtinagar>Srinagar>Rudraprayaga>Augustmuni>Chandrapuri ( totally washed away)>Kunda Chati>Guptakashi> Phata> Rampur>Sitapur>Soneprayaga>Gaurikund.From Gaurikund the trekking starts> Bhimbali>Ramwara>Lincholi>Kedar Valley. On 23rd September,2015 we reached Phata, a beautiful place, the Helipad is on  a little wayside hill, We got our booking for the Yatra on 24.09.15 with an instruction to must have Bio-metrics Registration at Phata Choti, followed by Fit Certificate by the doctors and to report at 7.00am on 24.09.15. In the morning of 24.09.15, we reached at 7.10am and showed our  boarding pass and we were told to get our weight , weight of the luggage up to 5kg, ,followed by security checking and we were asked to go to the helipad and instantly the copter landed, my wife was seated beside the captain and myself beside her left side. The back row were occupied by three foreigners from Singapore.Only 7 ( seven) minutes were to go when we landed at Kedar Helipad. Ours was the 2nd trip on that day. Last evening there was little rain, but morning of 24.09.15 was as sunny as the summer morning . The morning sun rays fell on the snow clad peaks and the view was spellbound. we feel why people suffers a lot of troubles, pains to reach Kedar. It is dual purpose- enjoying the mighty Himalayas and above all the Pilgrimage. In my opinion it is a one time achievement in one's life. Why September is the best month? Almost no cloud in the morning ,up to 12.00 noon, weather is so cool and clear, no rush in Military run camps.The state flower , Brahma Kamal, is in plenty available.There is another Helipad in Sersi, very near to Phata runs the service to Kedarnath by Himalayan Heli. There was no rush of pilgrims in Kedar this time. We brought 3 garlands, petals of roses, garlands of Akhand flower, leaves of wood apple from Rishikesh for worship the god. Breakfast, lunch & dinner are provided by the army. They have made camps of ten people accommodation with sleeping bag, hot water,  toilets.They have made the road to temple.There was a belly bridge on the river Saraswati that mix with the river Mandakini.Construction was going on for a ghat on the river Mandakini. There was a miracle which saved the Kedarnath Temple, a huge giant size boulder  just took position behind the temple to guard it from the wrath of the water current that swept away all the guest houses, shops, hotels, huts, dharamshalas, peope etc. Even the samadi of Adi Guru Shankaracharya swept away. Now this boulder is being worshipped as ""Bhimshila"". Kedar is taking his former shape gradually. It will take time. Om Nama Shivay."
161,Yatra in snowfall ,Wonderful trek. Don't miss Gauri Kund.The temple was built around the 8th century. The Sumeru peaks are just opposite .The Mandakini river flows by the trekking route. Tents are available and so are ponies and guides. It's a religious place of attraction. But the trek is a nature lovers delight. Open from April to Nov. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva.
162,Kearnath trip,The temple closes at 3pm for darshan... so reach early. In the morning you may be even allowed to touch the linga of Kedarnath. It is huge. Evening Arthi should not be missed either. The temple is lit up and the linga is decorated with the golden cobra on top of it. No one inside the temple pushes you for money. Outside you may get pressured by several sadhus. Off season is possibly the best time to avoid crowds and lines.
163,Delhi Kedarnath Yatra on opening day 03 May 2017,"The place is famous for the temple of lord shiva and it is a part of “Panch Kedar”(Five most famous idols of Lord Shiva in Uttrakhand state which ware found by Sankaracharya (a monk)) and 12 most famous idols of Lord Shiva of all over in India. Tracking route starts from Gaurikund. A similar “Taptkund” like Yamunotri is in Gaurikund. Water temperature is higher here at it is even more at night. This water is not frozen even is winter season when the entire area is covered with snow. There is a tracking route of 14 km. from Gourikund to Kedarnath. Kedarnath is located near the head of Mandakini. A small lake called Basukital is present near Kedarnath which is of 7 Km. tracking route. We have started early for this location because of long distance. Routes are quite developed and good in shape here as the place is quite famous. Horses and “Dandi” services are available alongwith Helicopter service from Fata. Small Tea and food stalls are available in route. Flow of Mandakini river can be seen in the route. Mid-dle point of the route is Rambara which is approx. 8 kms. from Gaurikund. Uphill way starts after Rambara. Tem-ple is at a small valley over the mountain. Small hotels are available for night stay. We stayed at a tourist lodge of GMVN. At the end of October, temperature is quite low. Pick of the mountains which are visible are covered with ice in this time and the scenery is quite good at night with starry sky. We stayed there for one day and returned on next."
164,Kedarnath Darshan,"Well all i can just say is this is most beautiful Jyotirlings out of the 12...and is placed amongst the serene himalayan abode. its is a must visit for all. you can visit this place for trekking, enormous himalayan views and great outing if not for religious purposes.Best time is to visit before 15th June and ensure full woollens. All the best and ""har har mahadev"" for all prospective visitors."
165,Highest Jyotirling in Himalayas ,Kedarnath Mandir is a must see place it is peaceful place to all ages and also well known it some people take meditation and more
166,Heavenly temple with facilities,More wider road had been developed from Sonprayag to Kedarnath 90% work has completed. Earlier road  which was only 14 KMS long in 2012 disaster has been mostly destroyed lies on left mountain ranges clearly seen from newer road and the newer road which lies on right side of mountain ranges is 22 KMS long. Those who have little tracking experience or don't walk too much should ovoid going own foot instead they should go on horses which cost Rs 2100 one side.
167,Jai Kedar,Kedarnath Temple is a must visit once in a LifeTime. Its 18KMs Trek from GauriKund. Its just below the Himalayan Snow clad Peak. It normally takes 2-3hrs for Darshan.
168,Still cant forget the beautiful feeling of being here!!!,"The trip to Kedarnath in August 2019 was undoubtedly the Best Journey I have taken in life. The weather was harsh and unpredictable and the roads/pathways were not in good shape. It took huge amount of energy and mental toughness to reach here. But once I reached the Temple, I felt a pure sense of Divinity which is really unmatched. As the Temple didnt have much devotees in Mid-August, I got an opportunity to offer a VIP Pooja for about 30 minutes.This place is a must visit once in Lifetime."
169,Jai Bhole Nath,This is the most attracted place in uttarakhad state. Lord siva got worshiped here. This temple is open only 4 months in a year
170,Who am I to say anything?,"Now going is easy. You can fly helicopter from Agasthamuni , Guptakashi or Phata even stay back for a day to watch Arti. Govt. accommodation and food is available at a very low cost."
171,Tough but worth every bit!,"We visited Kedarnath Temple - one of the four major sites in the Himalayas(char dham Yatra) - in the first week of July 2019. The temple is a testament to human engineering, architectural excellence and endurance. Built about 1000 years ago, the temple has withstood the vagaries of nature, and more recently the ravaging floods in June 2013. The areas around the temple complex suffered massive destruction, but the temple complex largely escaped without any harm. The Kedarnath temple is a symmetrical imposing structure built of stone about 1000 years ago. In the backdrop are the snow covered majestic Kedarnath main and Kedarnath dome mountains. The visit to this place to me was more of a spiritual experience. For a moment, when I first saw the temple, I was in a trance mesmerised by the sheer beauty of the barren snow covered Himalayan mountains and the temple in the foreground. The temple is devoted to lord Shiva. At the centre is a triangular shaped stone edifice - Shivling. It’s a strong belief that a prayer with a pure heart could forgive you from all the sins. Millions of devotees throng this place from May to October. The temple is closed in winters due to the harsh weather conditions. The deities are carried to Ukhimath - about 50 kms from Kedarnath and worshipped in this winter resting place. We noticed several people who were climbing barefoot with a bag slung behind their backs and some even carrying small babies in their laps. Old people whom you would never imagine walking a few hundred metres also slowly make it to the top. Their faith in the divinity gives them the power and the determination to complete this pilgrimage. It’s not easy to reach Kedarnath. We preferred to take the conventional route. And travelled on foot as well as ponies. The motor able road is up to Gaurikund. (Actually Cars aren’t allowed after Sonprayag and one has to take shares cabs from Sonprayag - a distance of 4 kms). From Gaurikund the trek up to the temple is about 17 kms. The journey on foot is treacherous as the climb is very steep - rising from about 6500 feet in Gaurikund to 11,500 feet at Kedarnath. The trek goes through some of the world’s richest bio reserves. Starts with temperate forests and then coniferous and alpine forests. The temple though is situated above the tree line. The entire trek uphill could take about 5-6 hours. The govt has made good arrangements for any health emergency and the entire route is well paved. The only problem while trekking is the numerous ponies who tend to crowd this track. But the natural beauty of this trek makes your fatigue vanish. It is dotted with glaciers, the Mandakini river, numerous waterfalls and in the distance the majestic snow covered peaks. We stayed for a night at Kedarnath at the GMVN guest house which was very well equipped. It is suggested that online booking is done during the peak season ( May to June). Once the monsoons starts in July, the trek becomes very difficult due the slush and the danger of landslides. One could then attempt to do the journey in September and October. An easier option is to a helicopter ride from either Guptakashi or Phata. It takes about 15 minutes, and you are suddenly transported in a different world. But nothing can replace the walk upto the temple from Gaurikund. I would say that it has been a great experience of making this pilgrimage. Besides a relaxing trek, it has rejuvenated our spirit and renewed our faith in humanity."
172,Holiness and enchantment combined,"The approach road to Kedarnath from Rudryaprayag is in shabby condition and the ride is extremely bumpy.We reached Sersi and had a night halt there and took helicopter ride from there to the Mandir. The ride is extremely enjoyable and just a few odd minutes duration.On reaching Kedarnath mandir the view is majestic with the snow covered mountains in the backdrop.The mandir is about 500 meters away from the helipad and one needs to climb some stairs also. Though porters are available if someone cannot walk this distance.During these last days before the Mandir closes for winter break on 21st October, the crowd was manageable and we could have darshan of Lord Kedarnath after a short wait in a small queue.Everybody is allowed inside the sanctum where the Jyotirlinga is housed and one can have a pooja conducted by self or by Pandits readily available. Spend sometime inside and one is allowed to touch the triangular Jyotirlinga and feel the divine energy.Plenty of shops are there selling offerings for pooja and food items.There are cottages and rooms available in case somebody is interested in overnight stay.We left by return helicopter flight back to Sersi fully drenched in the grace of Lord Mahadev at Kedarnath.It is a must see place and the experience will definitely touch you deep inside somewhere."
173,A most beautiful sight was at dusk when the mountain tops behind the temple were seen covered in snow.,"Traveling to Kedarnath is not easyThe roads are being constructed, a four lane all weather road should be ready in two years. Helicopter flights may not take off on the day you desire. They are cheap, so there is rush. You may reach late. But the disappointment of not returning same day is quickly turned into fortune as you watch the evening ""Aarti"" , a sight to behold, with the music, reverence, sadhus and poojari making it ""an event""Visit to inner sanctum, at the time of ""Abhishek"" and later at time of ""Shringaar"" is a pious experience. I felt lost. Weeping , smiling, thankful , blessed to be there.It's cold at night. But sunrise on the peak is a gift from Gods which only fortunate few will view. Visit if you can, as long as you are physically fit. It's worth it all"
174,Char Dham (Three Dham actually),The place is marvelous with scenic beauty and full of adventure. You can feel the energy of gods blessings every where.Best time to visit is during early May and prefer morning hours for prayers as afternoon and evening heavy rain occurs.
175,Life time experience to feel great,"The first thing you feel on reaching this place is immense satisfaction and divine spirituality that only a few religious place can boast of. Tucked between the massive ice capped mountains, it is indeed a worthy abode to the Lord himself. The temple is an architectural marvel in itself and had been built centuries ago. By offering his prayers here, one not only attains salvation but also feels at peace with himself. No wonder many devotees brave the rough weathers and hardships and flock here in large numbers. The trek from Gaurikund, however is exhausting and the path is dirty and filled with waste. It is an absolute inconvenience and should be avoided. There are many Helicopter services to Kedarnath and they can quickly commute you to the destination."
176,Kedarnath Dham- One of 12 Jyotirling,"Kailash Residency was the Best Place to stay . The surrounding is really beautiful except they do not have wifi. Room are spacious . Food are good and their hospitality was the best . I should said that Mr. JP Tiwari entertain us and take care of us . He even told us where is the best place to visit with guides . Unfortunately we left on 26/5/15 one day stay for our Kedarnathtour . IF I know the place is beautiful , I should come back for overnight before heading back to Rishikesh . I would like to Thanks him MR. Tiwari . Dehli contactno. 011-65182501,26687579."
177,Close to GOD in the lap of Himalaya,IT is tree indeed the GOd really Staying here. It is AMAZING after 14 KM trek when you see the temple all your misery is vanish in a minute. Yes we had bad experiance with temple staff while booking for pooja ticket. you have to take it in to your stride to be peaceful near The Gods feet. You will Forget all the world around This place.It is so beautiful & peaceful.
178,THE AMAZING TRAVEL TO KEDARNATH...!!!,Every Hindu should at least once visit the Kedarnathji Mandir and have darshan. These days you can book helicopter tickets online with the authorised carrier directly. Please go trekking or go by pony or doli. If possible visit the Bairavanath temple temple also. Many do not know about the Bairavanath temple which may take an additional one and a half to two hours.
179,Spiritual ~ Divine ,"Must visit , good spiritual place and recommended for all. Besides nature you can see lords arrangement also. We went by helicopter"
180,Divine Darshan,"It is beautiful, thrilling and divine trek,1 st  Night stay at Lincholi , I think best option, on 2 nd day : You reach Kedarnath by 2 Hr. Ponies are available. GMVN and NIMs tent are available. Rates are nominal, If you dont want to stay , you can return back, but will miss Bhairav Mandir."
181,Sivamayam,"Kedarnath is one of the most sacred pilgrimage of Lord Shiva situated in Rudraprayag district in the state of  Uttarakhand.  It is situated at an altitude of 3584 meters ( 11780 feet) in a breath taking location of mighty Snow-clad peaks near the source of river Mandakini.  Kedarnath is one of the chardhaam and most important in Panch- kedar ( group of 5 Shiva temples in Garhwal Himalayas). Kedarnath is one of the twelve Jyothirlingas of Lord Shiva and  attracts devotees from all over the world. The beautiful mountains views around the temple looks like a heaven and devotees feel that it is a excellent place for meditation.  Kedarnath is accessible to major destinations of Uttarakhand and motorable road stretches to till Gauri Kund.  After that tourists need to take a 18 km trek towards to temple.  Horses,  Pony and Doli available and one can also avail helicopter services. It is believed that originally Pandavas built the temple of Kedarnath and later sri Adi Shankara charya restored the glory of the  shrine. The temple opens for public in the first week of may to November and remaining 6 months remains closed due to heavy snow fall and during that period the idol of shiva is shifted to Omkareshwar temple in Ukhimath."
182,Jai Bolenath!!,"Shivoham ...Twice I am lucky to witness this blissful eleventh of the 12 Jothirlingas , first time in 2010 June and second time in July 2011, first time solo , I started to trek from Gouri kund at 5.30 am and reached around 11.30 am had wonderful darshan , did pooja. Sat in silence and felt the positive vibrations over there and started to trek back at 2.30 pm and reached Gouri kund at 7.00pm .Second time I went with my friends , we started to trek at 12.30 pm and reached in the evening , had darshan of Shri Kedarnath Ji and stayed over night in the peak , it was very cold in the night , early morning we did pooja with the pandit , it was really really very very blissful experience .Must visit for all age groups .Om Namaha Shivaya ...Loving you so much ...Peacefully yours ...S M Bega Raaj."
183,Holy Lord Shiva temple at breathtaking place with astonishing view,Devine please of lord shiva.Must visit please in you list.Hindus one of the most admired place Near Himalayas.
184,Journey from Sonprayag to Kedarnath Temple,"Visited by the old trekking route 14 days before the calamity hit on 15.06.2013...The trek is definitely hectic and long...You can never predict the weather during your trek...And it was true in our case too..When we started from Gaurikund, the weather was bright, sunny and sweaty...Suddenly, a heavy downpour hit at midway at Ramwada...Then suddenly small ice-droplets started falling...The temperature dropped from 30 degree at Gaurikund to 5 degree at Ramwada...Our finger-tips turned blue...But when I saw the first look of the Kedar mountain at the distance, I was crying literally in joy and happiness...A feeling I hardly can describe...It is a trip that has changed me...It brought calmness, confidence, patience, and many more good things within me..."
185,Here faith thrumps everything else.,"When we started the journey, i had no idea how it is going to be. We started our trekking morning by 07:00 am. The beauty was at its best when it comes to Mandakini river flowing accompanying your way to the temple. It was a magnificent view when i saw the temple with greenery spread all over and the mountains covered with snow was the unforgettable view of the Lifetime !!!!!!!!!After waiting in a que for around 4 hours finally we were lucky to get the darshan of ""Mahadev"" bcoz the temple closes for a break around 3pm. While going back to the hotel again a nature beauty yet to see "" Snow falling all over"".I would suggest everyone to visit Kedarnath at least once in a lifetime which will vanish all the negativity in a person."
186,Must watch temple,"Lord Shiva in a divine form. Kedarnath temple is an sheer divine experience one must undertake once in a lifetime.The holy temple is located between the mountains.There are three ways to visit Kedarnath ji1.Helicopter 2.Pony3TrekHelicopter hardly takes 5 mins to reach temple,Pony takes approx 4 Hr & trek takes 5-6 hrs .The path to temple has been developed very well by Govt now & is mostly safe.There are many small dhabas on way to temple.Tents for stay are available frequently too"
187,Gruelling horseback ride up and down Kedarnath,The temple at Kedarnath is one of the most sacred temples in the country. Each year the summer months see thousands heading to make this difficult pilgrimage.The temple at Kedarnath is one of the most sacred temples in the country. Each year the summer months see thousands heading to make this difficult pilgrimage.
188,While I reached to Kedarnath- I feel an achievement,"Visited on 02-07-2018. Must visit once in a life. Trekking very hard now approx 18 km after 2013 flood (Before 2013 it was 14 km). Clean, peace and the most beautiful weather. Not at all expensive."
189,Gods Abode,"Kedarnath Temple is beyond reviews. Whether you are planning for religious purposes or just for an extraordinary selfie, you won't be disappointed! Here are the Pro tips: 1. Booking by helicopter:Several Helicopter operators operate in the region. We booked through Pinnacle Air (Amit Pinnacle Air; Mobile：094123 22968;) at Rs. 6700 per ticket both ways from their Phata helipad to go and return on the same day (17th June 2018). We booked over a month in advance but you can at times book on the same day also,depending on availability. The ride is for about 6 minutes each way. Booking the heli through agents attract much higher charges (starts at Rs. 12000). Helicopter runs based on weather and if the service is down you will get a full refund. I highly recommend avoiding any agent and contacting the helicopter service companies directly. They have no hidden charges and are vetted strictly by Govt officials - one of the most well organized places I have seen in India. For days when rush is high and you have a 'same-day-return' ticket, they ask you to buy a priority Puja pass at Rs. 2500 per head. However we did not have to, since rush was low. Helicopters officially allow only 2kgs carry on luggage per person and not more. However practically the bags are not weighed and as long as you have a backpack or less, you'll be fine. 2. Walk to the Temple: The Mandir is about 10mins walk from the Kedarnath helipad at slow pace, in which you will cross the Mandakini River origin. There are cemented steps reaching down to the river. The backdrop of the Kedarnath Temple with the towering Kedar mountain behind it is mesmerizing.3. The PujaWe met Pujari Mr. Deepak Shukla (+91 94109 33058) near the Helipad and accepted his services. He assisted the four of us (two of us almost 80years old) all along inside the temple and the Puja was very satisfying. The Mandir closes at 3PM so try to be there in time. We were lucky to reach by 230PM and still make it for the elaborate Puja, since rush was low. Mr. Shukla was helpful in every way. 4. Access to/from the Temple :There are several options to reach and return Kedarnath Temple apart from the helicopter, namely - walking (19 kms - walk starts/ends at Gaurikund), Pony ride (Rs. 2500, uphill, Rs. 1500 downhill-takes 4/5hours), or Palki (4 people literally carrying you - Rs. 3500 or higher.... Not regulated at all)  It often happens that people arriving via helicopter gets stuck due to weather and have to come down by Pony. 5. Night stay:If you decide for a night stay, or get stuck due to the helicopter service not being available, around the temple there are several lodges providing accommodation at roughly Rs. 800 to 1000 for four persons.6. Best time to visit:For best weather conditions visit in Sept Oct when the tourist rush is also low and hence rates are slashed. However this time is colder and expect minus temperature during the day also at Kedar. 7. Other things to be aware of :Beware of the sudden altitude change (you are climbing from 5000 to 11500 feet above msl in a matter of minutes). There is a rapid temperature and pressure change.Carry adequate warm clothes and then some more.....carry portable Oxygen cylinder for breathing troubles (esp elderly people) and rain-gear, since rains are frequent. Carry all meds with you and always consider the possibility of a night stay at Kedarnath. You just may not be able to come back. Be prepared."
190,Happy journey ,"One of the best days in my life was when I walked towards the Kedarnath Temple. You have to walk about 14KMs from Gauri Kund to reach the temple. It's very cold but very divine. During morning hours, you can go near the Shiva Lingam and perform Abhishekam and Pooja. You are allowed to touch the Lingam. Don't miss the evening Arati. I can't forget that. ""Om Namah Shivaya""."
191,One has to be blinded by faith and superstition to enjoy,"This is one of the 12 Jyotirling and situated at high altitude. The view is mesmerising and temple is very ancient and beautiful. The area was severely affected during 2013 flood, but it is all back on track."
192,It was really fantastic,I have no words to express my feelings. Superb hill area and snow hills behind the temple. Nice Water flows. Journey from Gaurikund to Kedarnathji Temple by foot is very memorable in life. I can't forget it. I shall not miss the chance to go there again. It is Lord Shiva's great gift.
193,Follow the HEART!,"Very beautiful, walk, have sip of tea on sideway roadside eateries. Pray lord Shiva and track along Mandakini river. Natural with smell of pine in air"
194,"""Lord Shiva's Maha Jyotriling in Himalayas""","Myself and my wife have been most fortunate and blessed to be able to complete the 12 jyotirlings in about a year and half. And no less than KEDARNATH to be our last one.We embarked on this most awaited holy trip albeit bit wary of the travel and temperatures to deal with.We started on the 10th of september and flew from mumbai to dehradun via delhi and on reaching dehradun , drove from there to guptakashi a 5 hour drive amidst mountains and ridges and steep turns and twists, With over night stay at Camp Nirvana in guptakashi , we awaited with bated breath to take the chopper for a 10 minute dream flight to KEDARNATH.  Here I must be honest in saying that we could not fly the first day having waited the whole day at the take off point for the helicopter but still we had patience and belief to make it the next day and good lord we flew the next morning at about 6.30 AM and the ride was spectacular and sensational for us, crossing many mountains and the beauty before kedarnath. Very special mention of captain Rajiv Goyal , who was a calm quite , smiling, enjoying his music yet very warm person with talking a word and making us feel privileged. On landing at Kedarnath we were feeling blessed and on top of this world. Though it is an irreparable loss, the unforeseen natural havoc at this great place in 2013, still the way in which things were organised and managed by the team of students from Nehru Institute of mountaineering in uttarkashi, this is what i was told and then the government deployed staff also works there. The government provides food for the pilgrims. A meal costs Rs70 and tea Rs10. Bio-friendly toilets have been set up as well. We stayed in a cottage with self bags to warm ourself and it was quite neat and maintained including the toilet with hot water geyser facility. Conditions were not all that settled though one can imagine with such a devastation it would take time. The people there and the animals all work hard carrying heavy weights over themself and looking to repair things. Climate was off and on with nights being chillier and biting cold.  And most importantly the temple of Lord Kedarnath was simply eye filling and soul stirring and we sat there for hours absorbing the maha aarti and all the rituals there. The head priest Mr.Rajshekhar Ling is a wonderful person with all care and blessings and the maha aarti performed for over 30 minutes was nothing short of a spectacle by itself. I look to be in touch with the great man who has been doing the service as head priest for the past 41 years at kedarnath. What else can I say. Every Indian who follows this pilgrimage and the prayers to Lord shiva should without a question visit Kedarnath at least once in a life time as the journey and the stay and the feeling of being there and getting fortunate and blessed can surpass everything else. Just carry maximum warmers and woolies as possible as most people cannot bear the weather on a sustained level.Untill next time, I will always repeat JAI KEDAR."
195,Surreal!,"if you ever thought of God, visit this place. This year, route will be easy, 14 km but worth tavelling."
196,A Spiritual Journey to Kedarnath & Badrinath,"Its no mean feat to climb the steep trail touching 11755 feet . Though the distance board from Gaurikund reads 16kms it's actually 22 kms according to locals & the never ending distance proves their point. I visited on May 16th 2016 by trekking up n down . No doubt the path is beautiful but the heat around even at that altitude highly rebukes n punishes us for messing up with mother nature. Nights are cold n you will need winter clothes n blankets. Gmvn stay options are available at least base camp, Lincholi n Bhimbali priced nominally @ 500 & 300 per bed in 6 sharing in cottages n tents respectively. Cottages are good with gyser n charging points. Sleeping bag , mattress, nbeddinfs were clean. Filtered water was available. Food throughout the way was very basic n its pure veg starting from Guptkashi area. Water cold drinks were heavily priced high up @ 60 per bottle due to the accessibility issues. Saw a lot of pilgrims go back due to shortage of mules n helicopters. Most pilgrims were over 50s but their devotional spirit  was indomitable n 70 yr olds did they trail easily. The gradient is kind of similar to valley of flowers but the trail for vof was more naturally abundant n scenic. The rivers were almost dry in May though the climate could change anytime there, usually by noon it gets cloudy n raibs by evening. The visit was good in early morning when u can see the real form of the deity n he brings tears of joy in your eyes. U can touch & offer the offerings n take a round around the deity. The Bhim rock sits behind the temple , strong n sturdy n knowh to have protected the temple from 2013 floods. Prasad is @ 100 RS per box which u can carry back home. There are small shops outside mostly selling puja items. It's must to to complete biometric registration n there are several centers evn also at Kedarnath temple for helicopter yatris. These centers open around 6.30 in the morning n close @ about 8. Yatris above the age of 50 need to undergo health check too post photometric. Extreme scarcity of tourist vehicles caused a lot of unnecessary expenses as everybody was asking inflated prices for everything be it Jeep, hotel etc. Helicopter bookings were full n tickets in black were sold @ over 15000 against actual price of 7000..  After crossing these hurdles once you reach the Lord the pain vanishes n you are spiritually recharged. A must visit spot."
197,"One of a lifetime Journey........Very tough on foot........I had doubt about my fitness, but I did it.","We had planned for a day's trip to Kedarnath and back from Guptkashi in helicopter. Had a prior booking with Pavan Hans but received a last minute cancellation sms from them which would have jeopardised the entire trip. But we are really thankful to Himalayan Comforts manager Mr. Joshi who having this info of Pavan Hans problem had made alternate arrangements for us and we could fit into a day trip of Aryan Helicopter Service.We flew in from Guptkashi, a 16 min flight - a jaw dropping experience of Himalayan beauty flying over the Mandakini river with steep cliffs covered thick with pine trees giving a deep green foliage view on the right and inhabitable villages on the left with a gentle slope on the other side. It's sad that rules of not using mobiles or camera prevented us fromtaking photos of this awesome experience.We reached Kedarnath & a .5 km walk to the temple, the first view seemed to make us feel like reaching heaven - seemed more of a dream than reality. Then we noticed the long queue for entering the temple and got into it. In another 1,5 hours we could enter the temple. Inside the temple the usual mad rush, one needs to be careful of belongings as well as personal safety. The inside of the temple has images of the Pandavas and also Gods and Goddesses in beautiful black stone sculpture, again photography was barred inside the temple. We enjoyed the surroundings and then came back. A good initiative to keep the temple complex neat and clean and we donated some money to the cleaners for their effort.Possibly staying forthe night would have been a better option to get a clear view of the Kedar peaks at sunset and sunrise but that has to be a next time plan."
198,Temples in india,"they say it is the toughest amongst 12 jyotirlingas to visit... it must be, but kedarnath is a place every devotee must visit in his or her life time...yes the destruction of 2013 is still visible all around but the majestic temple still stands tall amidst it all.. we took UT airways helicopter from phata at rs 7000 per head, a 8 minute flight which is memorable as exiciting..and the views of the truly magnificent neelkanth parbat make this a trip of a lifetime.."
199,An ancient temple kedar,"Kedarnath is one of the 12jyothirlingas. Its located at the footsteps of himalayas and its an ideal location for people who enjoy temples and also feel the beautiful nature. There are hills, flowers, water falls, temple and so much. Its one of the most beautiful place i've visited (Mar 2009)."
200,Devine experience,"Kedarnath Temple is must visit temple. Trekking of approx. 16 KMs will take you this holy place. All your stress, tiredness, fatigue will fend off after having darshan of holy shivlinga of Kedarnath."
201,Holy Place for Hindu's,"Wat to say abt Kedarnath, no words to explain the beauty and feeling, U have to visit to feel. Still its the best and best after 2013 disaster. Temple is in the foot hill of fully snow claded NANDA DEVI MONTAIN and Mandakini river. Currently trek is about 22 km. Base village is Sonaprayag. Currently Trek timing is restircted as this trk will will take is almost 6-7 hrs (by walk) and 4-5 hrs by PONY(Rs 3200 up and fro) to reach Kedarnath from Sonprayag. Helicaptor facility also there for 7500 up and fro. Its MUST VIST place once in LIFE time."
202,Kedarnath Temple,Very holy place. Once you reach there you feel like you are on the best places on earth.Reaching there is challenging. Plan it properly. At least give 2 days to Kedarnath dham. It takes 8 to 9 hours to walk up to the shrine. Normally people start climbing at 4am from the base camp. They would stay at base camp prior night. Consider total time 18 hours to go up and come down. We started at 1pm afternoon and reached there are at 10pm. Stayed at Kedarnath dham overnight. There are limited hotels to stay  on mountain. We stayed at govt cottege. Took dharshan in morning by 9am. Reached back at base camp by 530pm. 9hours to Climb down.We went 6 members of family including 72years mom and 5years son. Pittu (to carry on back) is available at base they charge about 8000 for children and 11000 for adult. The horse is about 7000 for return. I walked up and down. Rest members of family opted for pittu. Horse ride is quite bumpy. Overall a different experience. Food is only Maggie and rice dal. Tea and biscuits. You don't get anything to eat after 930pm.
203,divine experience,This place is related to the shrine of Kedar(lordshiva) and considered as one of the most religious spots in Indian Pilgrimage. This is situated at an altitude of 3580 meters above sea level. The is one of the four holy places in the famous chardham yatra. This is believed to be one of 12 Jyotirlings of Lord Shiva.  Kedarnath shrine is known as the heaven for every pilgrim and due to this people go to distant hilly tracks of kedarnath even it it is considered as the remotest site in chardhams. Despite always being crowded with devotees despite being so remote. The Mandakini river flows going by this sacred spot and considered as the ideal way to wash the sins. The main charm of people for going to this pilgrimage is to search for one's soul.
204,Its a Heavenly experience,Kedar Nath temple is situated in great Himalayas. Temple can be reached by trekking 16kms from gourikund. Otherwise by helicopter from Gupta KASI or Phata.  60+ aged people my aggression is to book helicopter and go with a helping hand. No helicopter booking please avoid. Once you reach you will enjoy the shrine and excellent surroundings oh Himalayas. I suggest don't believe middle man for anything.
205,"ONE OF 12 JYOTIRLING, TOP IN HEIGHT","Who is not inspired by Lord Shiva? So is the beauty of Kedar. The trek takes you through splendid landscapes and the altitude scaled in humongous for a normal regular man. It's surreal beauty must be felt by visiting! I visited this place in May 2000, just for the purpose of filling, its kept as 2018. I believe it will be still the same."
206,Only if you are that religious...,"I visited Shri Kedarnath Mandir in the month of June. I was a little worried about the climate. But by the blessing of Bholenath the climate was pleasant. Now the yatra starts from Sonprayag and from Sonprayag the government operated gypsies takes you to Gaurikund at a price of rupees 20 per passanger. From Gaurikund Yatra is of 16 kilometres now. There are many facilities for the people such as temporary washrooms, emergency helipads, WiFi network at many stops, medical camps etc. The yatra is very difficult and ordous. From newly constructed Rambada Bridge new way to the temple has been put to use and one can see the remains of the devastating floods in the year 2013. Old Rambada Bridge has also been repaired but the new and more durable Rambada Bridge is in use now. There are many shelters in shape of tents for the rest of the pilgrims. These services are been provided by Garhwal Mandal organisation. Even after the devastating flood in the year 2013 the temple is still in its best form and there is hardly any destruction to the main temple. If you are not comfortable in staying in temporary tents, then there are also cottages made by Gadwal Mandal and they cost ranging from rupees 500 to 750 or 1000 depending upon the services provided in those cottages. There are also various dharamshalas at the Kedarnath which is very close to the main temple. However these dharamshalas are divided depending upon the region and the state you belong from. The temple is very beautiful and one can feel heavenly presence of the Bholenath at the temple. At the right on the mountain there is a temple dedicated to Bhairav Nath ji who is considered as the protector of the area. The temple is basically categorised in three parts. In the front of the temple is a idol of Nandi Maharaj facing towards the temple. The first part or the hall consist  the idols of Udhisharth, Mata Kunti, Bhagwan Narayan, Arjun, Nakul, Sehdev, Bhagwan Shri Krishna and Bheem, in clock wise starting from left of the entrance door. These ideals are made of black stone and one can easily feel the old granite used to make them. The second part or hall is the smallest of the three and conists of ideals of Shri Ganesh Maharaj and Mata Parvati. The third and the main part of the temple has a Shivaling in the shape of a mountain which is considered as back part or hind part of buffalo. You can read the story of kedarnath at Wikipedia. I felt blessed visiting this shrine and it was my dream too. I felt that i have met Mahadev himself..."
207,The Tough Deity for the Tough Spirits,Kedarnath ji is an extremely holy temple. A Jyotirlinga located at the highest level amongst 12 Jyotirlingas. I recommend overnight stay at Kedarnath ji.
208,Mesmerising beauty of Mandakini at Ramwara & Kedarnath on fullmoon night.,"One of the Four dhams for the hindus and one of the most enchanting place where this temple is built, just seeing the huge mountain behind the temple gives a thrill to you. You would get amazed how can such temple be made at such a height. Even after the 17 km journey you will not get tired because of the enchanting views and the pure fresh air of the himalaya that would just energize your soul to kedarnath dham. Once you visit this place you would like to come here again and again that i shall bet."
209,Experience the magic,"The temple at Kedarnath is beautiful and the stonework is worth viewing. It's amazing to think that such a temple was built ages ago at such a remote location where, even in this day and age, it's not easy to reach. And the backdrop in beautiful. Snow capped mountains and amazing views all around just take your breath away."
210,Divinity and Serenity,"We reached Sonproyag from Uttorkashi by afternoon. That is the end of all vehicle . From there local jeep service with per head 20 rs.Its about 6/7 Km.

The temple was decorated with lights. Only one bell was ringing in a rhythm.As temp comes down at  night   It is advisable for the visitor to carry  oxygen cane . There is medical center on the right side of temple premise."
211,OM NAH SHIVAYA,"Adi Sankara established Mutts,consecrated unique Temples 1400 yrs back to arrest the fast spreading Budhism at that time.He travelled to width and length of India to create Bakthi and illustrated true meanings of our Scriptures, so that even ordinary can understand. One such unique Temple at top most point of India is Kedarnath at 13000 feet,in the Himalayas.He consecrated a simple rock as Lord Shiva!(see picture)Even today one finds it difficult to make this very strenuous trip and if Adi Sankara made it,wearing a simple loin cloth 1400 yrs back, is Ample Proof, He is Lord Parameswara Himself!Since for most Hindus it is a once in a lifetime journey, I recommend the following:Kedarnath trip has many obstacles, many man made and I wd like to enumerate here for those who wish to make the Sacred Trip:1.Always book Helicaptor Tkts first and plan your journey.2.Ponies shd be avoided as 17+17 KM journey is hell for many.You will be worshipping with an unbearable Smell!3.Entire stretch from Rampur to Gaurikund/Guptakashi is so congested with vehicles, allow travel time @ 5KM/Hr!4.Everywhere you must shell out cash and be prepared!5.Spl VIP tkts for 2100(400 xtra with Aviation)is worth it for Quick n comfortable Darshn!6.Weather change is unpredictable. I was told after my visit next 2 days Temple was closed!Temperature is freezing even in daytime!7.If forced to go by ponies,keep (1)cash(2)torch(3)Airtel Mobile(Jio is Dead)(4)Warm clothings(5)Cashew/Ground nuts(6)0water"
212,Aesthetic Tour,Kedarnath is a jyotirlinga and hence visited.  It is part of Chardham yatra. Mandakini river flows near temple. Mandir has darshan times which must be seen on its official website. There is a lack of accommodation. You can go by helicopter or by pony. Helicopter service becomes uncertain from June onward due to weather condition. If going by pony then start journey from Gaurikund. There are 2 detour for Kedarnath from Bhim Bali. Ask pony person to go thru easy route. Total distance is 14 km. Pony drops around 1.5 km away from temple. You can walk also though it is slightly tough for old persons.About 10 km is good for travel. Approach is under construction.
213,Best place to visit and Tough to travel,"It was really amazing. Darshan was too difficult that is why it is said one of the most difficilult yatra. Even I consider Amarnath is easier then Kedarnath. Weather condition is really hactic so get ready with your clothes. I went from Pune so covered all the chardham, Gangotri, yamunotri, Badrinath ,kedarnath, mathura vrindavan, haridwar, Rishikesh. it took 12 days to travel but really amzing trip. I was the only one who drive the car for 5500 km. and it is easy to drive, some people says that you wont drive on hill and you have to hire driver etc but not a single issue I faced over there though I have only 7 months driving experience. we went by Scross. but if you are going then book helicopter services for kedarnath in advance, they charge 6000 because we got to know about this there so we didnt get ticket for that. because my parents are aged so they were unable to ride as there is 17km high walk on hill, and not to carry even a single water bottle, it will really frustrate you. Go with free hand."
214,"Kedarnaath, Uttar Khand,","The religious temple of Kedarnath is among the Chardham places in Uttarakhand, visited by a number of devotees every year. It is famous because it is among 12 jyotirlingas in India. Nicely built, this temple is among the biggest shrines in Himalayas, that displays an appealing architecture and big religious significance. According to Hindu mythology, Kedarnath is considered as the favorite place of lord Shiva for yoga & meditation. The holy river Mandakini flows along the town, adding more to its religious fervor and natural grace. The foundation of this modern temple was created by the Adi Shankracharya. Indian scholar However, even in Mahabharata epic. the greatness of this place is mentioned"
215,Spiritual journey,"We took the helicopter to Kedarnath and I think it was a smart decision because we were not worn out and did not have aching body parts when we went for the evening Aarti. That experience left me mesmerized because I did not experience something like this before.....it was like looking and listening to a musical play/opera dedicated to Kedarnath Ji !Participating in the  Maha Abhishekam at 4 am is very much recommended if one can afford the cost of 6,600 IRS.It was tough waking up at 3 am in a room with no heat, and no hot water but, I forgot it all as soon as I got to the temple. We were allowed in the inner sanctum of the temple and actively  participated in the Abhishekam...I did not travel thousands of miles to only get a second glance of the Shiv Ling but, was able to touch and prostrate many times! ( I would have been okay with even a glance for a second because there is other place like this on earth....except Mount Kailash and Badrinath!!  We spent the night in Kedarnath and I would recommend staying at the temple Guest Houses because the place is very well maintained and also there are electric heaters."
216,Kedarnath  Must visit in lifetime.,"Its 16 km trek from Gaurikund. You have to take taxi from Sonprayg to Gaurikund. No private vehicles are allowed from Sonprayg. Trek is bit tough. We started our trek at 10:30 am and reached at 7 pm. Everything is available at the trek. Horses, Pithu, Doli. You can book helicopter service also from online webiste at the cost of 6700/- one side. and u will be reached in 7 minutes. Temple opened at 6:00 am to 8 am. At evening u will see darshan with shingaar and in morning u will see Abishek darshan. I never forget this experience. Temp. is really chilled at night. I covered my face with muffler and hands with glooves in morning while standing in queue. But after darshan i will forget all my fatigue. Believe me its one of my best spiritual experience. When we return to Sonprayg rain started with hailing. Bring your warm clothes, raincoat with you. Everything is changed here after 2013. Trek is very clear as compared to manimahesh. Vasuki Tal trek is 8 km from kedar baba and bhairo mandir is 1 km. I came here for darsahan and my dream is fullfilled. Kedar Baba aatma ko sakun mil gya. Temple is sorrounded by large icy mountains. Unforgettable experience. Jai Kedarnath"
217,Epic journey with a majestical view of the Himalayas,"This is one one of the ultimate places for pilgrimage for Hindus. Reaching the temple is a challenge as one of the toughest terrains has to be covered to reach the temple. One can take a helicopter ride to the temple. This is my second visit and I had taken the aerial route this time as I traveled with my mother. Last time I and my mother visited the temple was few days before the Himalayan disaster(2013). Now the Govt. had provided a lot of facilities to the tourist in the temple premises at a nominal cost. The town of Kedarnath has ghostly looks after the disaster as one can see the temple standing surrounded with destroyed buildings and roads. All for faith, one must visit in one's lifetime and see the grandeur created thousand years back in such remote location. Visiting Kedarnath Mandir one can feel one with GOD."
218,Lovely place,"The divine feeling cant be explained in words. Moreover, the route was thrilling and fun filled. The paranomic view from 10000ft above sea level is mind blowing, with mountains covered with snow, mandakini river flowing below between the mountains etc were just mind blowing.Till Gourikund you can come in bus or car. From Gourikund, kedarnath is 14 kms upwards. You can walk, ride a horse, take baskets for elders etc to reach Kedarnath. The jouney is thrilling.This place is a must visit in lifetime. Be cautious , as the journey is very risky too."
219,Jai Bhole Nathji,-- Started from Delihi ISBT to Guptakashi by Uttrakand transport. Reached Guptakasi at 10 Am next day-- Stayed at GVNM Guest house (good hotel to stay decent room with all amenities for 2400)-- Took Jeep (non sharing) for Phata helipad. I paid 400 for jeep (if its sharing they charge only 50 rs)-- Booked Helicopter as next day services.(got helicopter only at 4 PM and reached Kedar at 4.06 Pm).-- From helipad temple is 500 meters (10 mins walk) and had good dharshan in one hour time-- Stayed at Kedar (GVNM guesthouse)
220,The cradle of faith,"I am and ardent Bhakt of Mahadev and I believe that Mahadev always hears your call if you call him from the bottom of your heart.We had recently been to Kedarnath in the third week of May.  We had organiised our tour thru Mahlaxmi tours and travels who claims to be a very good operator. But was a big fiasco.  The operator had botched up the whole tour. We a team of 8 members got in from Mumbai to Dehradun.  The Kedarnath darshan was on the next day itself.  We reached the helipad at 6.00 am and came to know that two of our members had a night stay at kedarnath and others were to return the same day.It was a shock for us to know that two members were to stay up. Our journey was next day again to Badrinath. The helicopter ride was also arranged at 2.30 pm . Mostly if the ride is in the afternoon rides are cancelled due to rains. We had a group of 7 members who had left from Mumbai just 5 days before and they were stuck in for 2 days at Guptkashi.All of us prayed to Mahadev that please get us thru. And Bholenath as he is cleared our way. We got some special darshan tickets and by 10.00 am  we got the helicopter ride to Kedarnath.There again its mesmerising to see the beauty.  The snow claden mountains, the clear air, clouds as is you are touching them.  Just beautiful. From helipad it takes around 20 minutes to walk to the temple. Just couldnt believe that ultimately we reached the temple. For special darshan there is a seperate queue which hardly takes 30 minutesInside the temple there are statues of Arjun, Bhim Mata kunti, Yudishtar. The Nandi golden in colour is very beautiful. Inside the temple we have to offer ganga jal, honey which you carry with you. But being May it was a bit crowded but still the darshan was superb. We dont get time to sit in the premises as there are lakhs of devotees. But it doesnt matter. Because here the god has already blessed you.  Being there is only with his mercy. None of your greatness.Har har Mahadev!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
221,Mandir OM,"Kedarnath Temple is located in the lap of Garhwal Himalayas, some 220 kms from Rishikesh,is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga of Lord Shiva.Lying against the backdrop of the magnificent Kedarnath Range, at an altitude of 11745 ft. The nearby flowing Mandakini River, mesmerizing vistas and splendid sceneries in the form of the snow capped mountains, greenlust forests, make Kedarnath a tranquil and picturesque landscape.It is one of the most prominent pilgrimages,particularly for the Hindus.Although you can trek the 20km route but i personally suggest you to take helicopter and spend time there. do take warm cloth as gets very cold out there and midnight abhishek and puja is something to look forward to."
222,Amazing ,"Weather in kedarnath is very unpredictable.The weather keeps changing.Wear layered clothing( leg warmers,thermals and woollen socks on which you can wear jeans or leggings and then the rain coat pant for the legsOn the thermals you can wear your dress, sweaters, thick jackets and rain coats.Cover your heads with monkey caps and rain coat hoodIt may be sunny when you are about to start either by helicopter,pony, dhollis  but it may start to rain suddenly.Weather becomes too cold and you may have to stay back in the temple premises itself for that night.Its going to be very chilly .Hence take proper precautions.People had died due to extreme cold which we saw with our own eyes."
223,In the lap of Himalayas,"For Kedarnath start from Haridwar.Take early morning bus from bus stand(just opposite to the station).If you somehow unable to manage it take any bus going to Rudraprayag/Guptkashi.Because if you are small group bus will be economical.Haridwar to Gaurikund bus fare is Rs 350/-head.Haridwar to Rudraprayag bus fare is Rs 235/- head.Bus will take around eight hours to reach Rudraprayag and four more hours to reach Sonprayag.No bus ply till Gaurikund.Only cab service is available(fare Rs 20 per person) in between till 10 pm.But after 8 pm fare will be doubled.Many small and big hotels are there in Sonprayag and in Gaurikund.Avail any of these.GMVN Gurikund is always in demand. But service quality is ordinary. Best option is to avail to and fro helicopter service from Phata(₹4700) or from Guptkashi(₹8500).Because it will save both time and energy.Phata is a small town before Sonprayag.Hotel facilities are ample. But try to avoid May -June.The trekking route starts from Gaurikund.Start early morning.If you are planning same day return must go for helicopter from Phata or Guptkashi or horse from Gaurikund.Upward fare for horse is Rs 2300 per person.downward fare ₹1500.Otherwise my choice is trek.Everyday you will not get this opportunity to walk in the hills.Though official distance is 16 km, I think it is around 20 km.Whatever,your attitude will determine your altitude.I can feel the cruelty in which we human deal the khachchar or horse.So i trust on my own feet.Enjoy beautiful journey.Beauty of the road is diminishing day by day….may be because of so called development.And who knows,development brings destruction as it was 2013.So visit early before beauty vanishes.(all fare as of October 2019).For medicine i used diamox once a day started two days prior to the journey.It helped."
224,A real heaven to worship Lord Shiva,I have no word to explain the beauty of kedarnath. It is one of the jyotirlings situated 10000ft above sea level. Journey from Gauri Kund to kedarnath 18 km on foot  would  never forget in my life.
225,Spiritual journey,This is a very beautiful temple... This temple is bhagvan Shiv...  It place is tour with family...  I am so happy on this place...
226,An arduous spiritual journey! ,"One can drive upto Sonprayag. There you have to register yourself with the government (very easy process). From there you have to compulsorily take a shared taxi to go to Gauri Kund which is 5 km away. There are a lot of places to stay at Sonprayag and Gauri Kund, and also enroute the temple. Shared taxis run between 5 am and 9 pm and charge Rs 20 per passenger.From Gauri Kund, the tough trek to Kedarnath temple is 16 km long.As per Shiv Mahapurana, once Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu had an argument as to who was superior. They approach Lord Shiva for a decision. Lord Shiva pierced the three worlds with a jyotirlinga (an endless pillar of light). Lords Vishnu and Brahma split their ways in either direction, to find the end of the light. Lord Brahma tells a lie that he has found the end, while Lord Vishnu concedes his defeat. Lord Shiva appears as a second jyotirlinga and curses Lord Brahma that no one would give him any importance in religious ceremonies, while Lord Vishnu would be worshiped till the end of eternity. There are twelve such jyotirlinga viz. Somnath and Nageswar in Gujarat; Mallikarjuna at Shrisailam in Andhra Pradesh; Mahakaleswar and Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh; Kedarnath in Uttarakhand; Kashi Vishwanath at Varanasi; Bhimashankar, Trambakeshwar, Girishneshwar in Maharashtra; Vaidyanath at Deogarh in Jharkhand and Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu. The new track is very well laid and has a lot of facilities. It is slightly longer than the older route, but it has many facilities. There are a lot of drinking water taps, mobile and fixed toilets, dhabas and first aid chowkies. We cross quite a few waterfalls. There is a constant stream of pilgrims, both walkers and horse-riders. Some government stops offer free wi-fi.To see the broken old route on the opposite side of the mountain is saddening. But then seeing the massive Bhim sheela right behind the Kedarnath temple will touch even the most hardened atheist heart. During the fatal cloud burst of 2013, a big chunk of mountain slid down towards the temple town. Out of nowhere a massive stone appeared and blocked the path of this land slide. The Kedarnath temple was protected from any damage.But prepare well before you start the trek. Preparation can include daily walking, climbing stairs, exercising, yoga and pranayam. But there is no doubt in my mind that only the grace and blessings of Lord Shiva can help one finish the Kedarnath yatra.Jai Bhole Nath!"
227,A must go...Moments of lifetime...Heaven,14 kms trek with the river Mandakini flowing and falling all the way is a great refreshing sight. But beyond that tp Mayali pass and Khatling is just amazing..

229,grt palce - must visit,"According to the mythology when Pandavas were searching for lord Shiva to ask for his forgiveness for having killed their kith and kins in the Mahabharata war, Shiva tried eluding them for a while. He took the form of a Bull and jumped down on the himalayas and subsumed in earth. Place where the hump of the bull can be seen is Kedarnath. Other parts of Shiva like his heart and hands, his locks, his Nabhi and his face are worshipped in 5 different temples in Himalayas and collectively they are known as Panch Kedar. Out of these 5, Kedarnath is the PRATHAM KEDAR hence most important.The temple was supposed to be built by the Pandavas themselves and therefore the Sabha Mandap has the idols of Pandavas along with Kunti, Draupadi and Shree Krishna. Vishnu and Laxmi are also present with Nandi Bull.Garbha Grah has the Shiva Lingam which resembles hump of a bull.There are images of Yakshas on the side outer walls of the temple and a very large stone Nandi sits outside the temple too.The Kedar peak which is of the height of 6950 Mtrs above msl. and is perpetually snow clad appears as the crown of the temple.One must stay at Kedar for atleast 2 days to explore the region as Kedar temple is not the only site to visit in the region. There are legends associated with the Ritasya Kund, Shankaracharya Samadhi and Bhairon Temple.Even the peaks on the back of the Temple and the left of the temple has stories to tell. The Left side peak is crossed by localites after the snow melts who go in search of Brahm Kamal.Treks to Chorabari Tal and Vasuki Tal starts from Kedarnath.Chorabari Tal (Gandhi Sarovar) is considered to be the source of Mandakini river."
230,A Spiritual Journey to Sri Sri Kedarnath,Hello everyone. Its a must visit place at least once in life time.we planned the trip after reading the reviews on trip advisor. Reviews stated October is the less crowded month but it will be very cold. Would like to share our experience.First of all before planning please c the opening n closing dates of the temple. Its usually closed on the 3rd day of Diwali. So plan accordingly.We started our journey from Rishikesh to gaurikund on 19th October by tata indgo by road. To save a day we drove from Rishikesh early morning at 5.am n reached sonprayag by late evening. The private cars are not allowed till gaurikund. Gaurikund is the starting point for trekking n ponies.You will get local jeeps from sonprayag to gaurikund for just minimum fixed rates n which is hardly 5kms distance. We had prior booking rooms  at GMVN n the best option in gaurikund. The staying idea at gaurikund is advisable only if trekking or going by pony or pittu.The helipad is few kms before sonprayag. So if traveling by helicopter better stay nearby helipad (rampur or sitapur not sure).You will need a biometric registration before starting the yatra which can be done online easily or at their counters. But just to save the time n queue better done online. Ponies n pittus have fixed rate by the government so no bargaining required. The pony can be booked one day earlier with ponywalas. He suggested us to leave early morning coz the weather can get bad after 12am.We started our journey at 5.30am  by pony n reached by 9.30am. Had booked a night stay at Gmvn Swargrohini cottages. After reaching the hotel manager told the same thing about bad weather. So as soon as we reached at 9.30 am we went to the temple n stood in the queue. It was not crowded at all n it took us just half n hour to get inside the temple. Had a good devine darshan. After coming out of the temple saw the miracle stone n the sat glazing around in a peaceful atmosphere for sometime. N like the ponywala n hotel manger said the weather started changing n suddenly the 1st snowfall of the year started n started getting colder n colder. We came to room n rested but all of us could not sleep due to the cold weather n heaviness in the head. It started snowing heavier. The plan to stay slowly changed around 3.pm due to the weather. Suddenly we thaught of returning back to gaurikund n went to the pony stand n started returning back. Reached gaurikund around 9.30 pm. But getting down by pony was a nightmare. Almost the knees n lower back goes for a toss.some people had warned us a day before about returning back on ponies but we took it lightly.But when we came back there were no rooms at gaurikund as well as at sonprayag. So had to go to sitapur around 10.30pm. But by the end of the day it was a blissful Darshan.
231,Kedarnath in seven minutes !,"We took the helicopter ride to Kedarnath. Please ensure that you book in advance with Pawan Hans as your carrier. They are the most reliable. We saw so many people stranded with other chopper services. Also it is a must for registering your chardham yatra and get a doctor's certificate one day in advance or absence of both can delay or cancel your flight. These services are available in the area near the chopper service ofiices. At the chopper office while registering to fly, we bought special darshan ticket that allows entry without waiting in the queue and you can make it back to the return journey by chopper in time. Cost of the darshan ticket is Rs. 1100 per person. After all the wait to fly as it is weather dependent, once you enter the temple area, there is utter chaos. No organized way to enter the temple. There was a stampede situation at the main sanctom santorium. I was pushed by a pandit who was performing pooja for a couple for no reason. It is the same shoving and pushing and ""I FIRST"" attitude that removes all sanity and sanctity from your being. Pushing shoving without respect for the other pilgrim who is ahead is a norm. Every pandit is requesting for a dakshina. Only after a dakshina would you get prasad and flowers or boiled rice.Did I forget the unhygienic conditions that prevail?Well, if not for anything these places really teach you to be patient and forgive. Wonder how long one can maintain composure when all the places one visits have the same story. There is no spirituality left in the place.  I learnt that ""if you cannot beat them, you join them"" the hard way. I  stamped on the shivling because I was pushed and held on to somebody for balance and had to push back to regain composure - did I have a choice?????? Horrible experience. I felt disgusted with the way pilgrims behave.Plan to leave your hotel by 5 am for the darshan."
232,Should visit once in a lifetime,"Kedarnath temple It is located in the Gharwal division of Uttarakhand amidst snow capped mountains 🏔 Mandakini and Saraswati rivers flowing by .The first sight of this temple has kept me startled.It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya has established this temple , it is a prominent one and is one among the 12 jyotirlingas in India .Located at a height of about 3500 meters this temple is covered with snow for nearly six months ..(A visit to this temple has made sure I have completed all the 12 jyotirlingas - any questions on how to travel or for more details do reach  out to me .).Best time to visit : September, October (it’s open only for six months - opens in May during Akshaya tritiya and closes in November during Diwali )Nearest airport : - jolly grant airport Dehradun ✈️ From there it’s about 300 kms by road .Travel Tip : Do carry warm winter gear and wooden clothes -climate here is unpredictable.To reach Kedarnath temple one has to trek for 16 kms .Or alternatively choose a palki or a helicopter 🚁 ride costs about 5000₹ for two way ride..For more such updates on places to see in India do follow"

234,Changes after the Uttrakhand Floods - 2015,"You cant review or describe it. One should visit the temple by walking from Gourikund, then after entering into the temple premises you will found inner peace."
235,KEDARNATH - ONCE IN A  LIFETIME HOLY TRIP - MOST MEMORABLE,**Reached by Chopper (Boarded from Phata).**Stayed there for one night in Dharamshala in Kedarnath.**Tiwari bhojnalaya close to temple has all variety of veg food but expensive most.**This place for kids is not recommended due to low level of oxygen.**Temperature goes down in Minus after sunset.**Headache is very common there**Keep camphor with you and smell it.**Helicopter services are worst here.
236,KEDARNATH - Jyotirling in the foot hill of HEAVEN,"The current natural calamity highlights the reason why Hindus treat this pilgrimage with such deep devotion. It is a test of their faith and the fact that hundreds and thousands have been visiting this temple for so many years, even when the traveling conditions were no so conducive is enough proof that still FAITH is there in abundance. This is not the most spectacular of Hindu shrines but you just need to look beyond the temple to absorb the grandeur of this place.I am tempted to for a second visit in spite of what has happened."
237,paradise on earth,One of the most sacred place on the earth dedicated to lord Shiva. Everyone from any religion should go there to feel the supreme energy and the stunning natural beauty.
238,Pilgramage Tour to Kedarnath Temple,"I travelled last year 2015 June, by southern travels they did not book helicopter tickets we had to book it on our own.. The travel is too dangerous weather can change with in 2 minutes, no guarantee of returning on same dAy, due to bad weather I had to stay with full of fear whole night in millatry tents with biting cold no facilities in kedarnath, it is really tough for old and young people I saw literally 8 to 12 year old kids were crying due to cold weather and improper organisation of helicopters due to bad weather, i suggest every one to wait until good facilities are provided.. Especially Telugu people stay away till everything is that is all facilities are available then only I suggest Telugu people to go or else stay @ home and say on Namath Shivaya.."

240,Great temple amongst enchanting himalayas!!!!!,"Visiting the Kedarnath temple is an experience by itself. Nestled in the Himalayas, with the snow capped mountains behind, one of the jyotirlingas, it is a spiritual journey. Anybody who has the chance and resources, do not miss going to this wonderful place. The serenity and Shanti that envelops you here has to be experienced. For the travellers who are staying overnight, do carry loads of warm clothes. We went on May 16th and it was extremely cold."
241,ethereal experience,"Situated at 3500 m height , Sri Kedarnath temple is one of the 12 jyotirlingas of India . Legend has it , that the Pandavas were searching for Lord Siva in Himalayas to penance for gotra hatya sin ie for killing their own relatives . Lord Siva didn't wish to meet and roamed there in the form of a bull. Bheema realized this and caught hold of Bulls tail while the Pandavas prayed to the Almighty . Siva became happy and blessed them and asked them to build a temple . So ,the sivalingam inside is in the shape of a bull half buried inside earth . Temple opens in late April / early May . One can reach by helicopter service . Trekking enthusiasts can trek around 16 Kms from Gaurikund or 21 Kms from Sonprayag ( the last stop for private vehicles ) One can hire a pony or a pitthu ( a person carries you on his back in a basket ) . Rates are fixed but most of the times its heywire and lots of bargaining takes place because of vested interests . I must say ,after visiting 3 times in past few years that UK government has no clue how to manage the things at Kedarnath. Very inefficient people working and no tourism mindset . A water bottle at the top costs 50 bucks . Food costs a bomb . Irrespective of all these bottlenecks , I salute the tenacity and devotion of the pilgrims who enthusiastically do this Yatra"
242,the abode of shiva,"There are few places on earth which fills you with such divine energy that long breathtaking trek to reach there is easily forgotten the moment we reach there. Kedarnath temple is one such place which rejuvenates our soul with so much divine energy the all the pain of more than 10 kms trek is easily forgotten the moment we get a glimpse of lord Shiva's ancient temple rising amidst the snow mountains. The architecture of temple makes one wonder how it was made possible to build a temple with such huge stones in that era, that too at such a high altitude. It is indeed a miracle on its own. And the journey is made interesting with devotees from all walks of life trekking along with mysterious sadhus. There are decent arrangements for food and shelter by government along the way plus medical help at various places. One feels that with only divine energy one can complete such an arduous journey. Though there are heli services for those who prefer to miss the adventure."
243,Experience the divinity and lovely scenary!,"You dont need to be a Hindu or a worshiper of Shiva to visit Kedarnath. If you are a lover of beautiful nature or simply the Himalayas, don't hesitate to go and visit Kedarnath. And if you manage to learn the tales of the epic Mahabharata you will only understand why lakhs of Indian pilgrims over hundreds of years take all the trouble to visit it.It is much safer and easier nowadays to visit Kedarnath and if you can I would suggest you walk the 14 kms from Gauri kunda to Kedarnath.Start early so you reach by mid-day.Staying is not too 5 star like but you can manage in the many Dharamsalas. Spend at least one night to view the Kedarnath peak the next morning at dawn."
244,Kedarnath Mandir,If you really want to go the place there you feel god in real so come here you feel the goodness of nature many tourist come to visit the place the way to temple is little bit risky but you will come in the home of mahadev
245,Jai Kedarnath ,very nice experience of snowcapped mountains and a temple standing tall in the himalyas! the experience is so thrilling that we were literally not ready for !
246,Where your heart gets refreshed,"How to reach from Haridwar:Bus/Shared taxi to Rudraprayag...bus tkt cost 250rs.....6 hoursBus/ Shared taxi from Rudraprayag to Sonprayag Cost 100 rs.....4 hoursImp: Shared taxis are too crowded but fast. Bus slow but not so crowded. Start early 5 am from Haridwar for 1 day drive to  Sonprayag. So that road blockages sometimes can be managed.For helicopter service you have to check with individual providers usually from guptakashi to rampur. Depending on which one is operating, you have to go there from Rudraprayag. Helicopter ride is 8 mins.7000rs. Both ways.Trek/pony ride is 21km from Sonprayag. We went on 26th July 2015. Earlier trek used to start from gaurikund pre 2013. Now it starts from Sonprayag since gaurikund is inaccessible due to bad roads. Pony takes 6hours and 1800 rs one way.If you plan to do it in one day, start early on pony at 5 AM so that you are back by sundown. Sitting on pony is very painful so preferably take a night halt. 1day trek is impossible and you have to take a night halt.Stay options:Decent hotels just 2 kms before Sonprayag shivalik resorts, GMVN( 1000rs double bedroom).For helicopter services enquire with respective providers.At Kedarnath Temple top, you only have GMVN tents/ cottages which have basic facilities. Tent 50rs per person, cottage 150 rs per person night stay. I stayed in a cottage which is 6 person. It had geyser and clean bathroom. Nice stay.Darshan:Do not buy darshan passes. No one visits kedarnath these days. We were 8 tourists in a day at kedarnath. So you have ample time at the temple and shivling darshan.2013 tragedy created huge devastation at kedarnath. Entire villages got wiped out near temple. Totally new path was created from 2014,which is very different from pre2013 path.Road and way till kedarnath is very good.  Medical facilities and SDRF( Special disaster relief force) at every checkpoint during trek. Great arrangements for your safety and darshan. Go there care free. Information system and advance warning system are excellent. So focus on your Darshan of KedarnathJai Bhole!"
247,"Nature Lovers, Must Visit","Kedarnath is among my favorite spiritual places in the Himalayas. The rough track, thin air and magical atmosphere, in and around the temple, is a blessing for body, mind and spirit. On this occation the temple and track was overly crowded by visitors. Long lines and hours of waiting. Try to avoid high season in may and june if Its so much more joy to meditate undisturbed in the temple. Make sure to drink lots of water and snack on your way up, to avoid altitude sickness. And bring warm clothes!Stay at least a few nights and make sure to visit the surrounding area."
248,Kedarnath by helicopter.,"One of the 12 jyotirlings in india and the toughest one to reach, kedarnath temple is a temple of lord shiva. I did trek to reach temple from gaurikund. Started 6am from gaurikund and reached at 12:30. Did darshan and came back to ggaurikund and then to sitapur. Rainy and chilling weather. Its not advisable to do treks in monsoon season.  There were a huge rush at temple for darshan and no such Q system inside. But luckily got a good darshan. For elderly people and kids, i would like to suggest to do this trip by helicopter. There are also some other ways like palanquins, pony and pitthu. For palanquins, we must need to do advance booking one day before at gaurikund."
249,Surreal experience at the Kedarnath Temple,"The experience is beyond words. Chopper rides are available from several places - took one from Guptkashi.The temple has been the there for several centuries and of course integral to our culture, history, traditions and life.You can feel the presence of The Lord himself when you reach here.Very well developed place - temple is 500m from the helipad.Most fit people can just walk to the temple. There are people to lift you and take you there on their backs - Fees is fixed by GMVN so please check the same and book.You can pay Rs. 5100 and do an Abhishek for 5 of family from 12.00 AM to early hours of morning. Abhishek ticket can be purchased from temple office on the right hand side of temple. You skip any queues at those hours and get to sit beside the Shivling for Abhishek.There will be some queue for normal Darshan but not too long. Priest performing the Abhishek are good and chant all the mantras for you very diligently. No need to engage with outside priests for anything.It’s of course freezing cold. So take your jackets and body warmers.GMVN Cottages accommodate 4 in a room and have geyser for hot water. 100 m from Helipad.They serve buffet lunch, though didn’t have it."
250,Fortunate To Visit,Kedarnath is the temple of lord Shiva. This is one of the most sacred temples in India. it is so divine and peaceful. The whole place is so mesmerizing and the way to the temple is also unforgettable. Some people prefer walking but there are horses and helicopters available. Experience while journey to the kedarnath temple it's so refreshing it keeps your mind calm and divine.The whole place is so mesmerizing and the way to the temple is also unforgettable. Some people prefer working but there are donkeys and helicopters available. I will never forget my experience while journey to the kedarnath temple it's so refreshing it keeps your mind calm and divine. I recommend this place.
251,Jai Kedarnath Ji Ki,Very beautiful holy place. I love the surroundings and holy atmosphere of that place. But hard to reach.
252,There sure is energy,"First half of trek was mostly problem free and and steady and achievable by the masses, however the second half after you cross the man made bridge became extremely strenuous , difficultly level increased drastically. most of the 11 friends/relatives got on horses because the steepness was just too demanding. I carried on to the top and eventually achieved the goal by foot, be warned weather can change very quickly, we had hailstorms rain and snow showers with squally winds inbetween. Ultimately it's worth it just to see the Jawdropping awe at the top. Tranquility and eye watering beauty awaits you .❤️"
253,Truly Amazing & Life Changing,We boarded a helicopter in Dehradun . We first flew to Badrinath. We were dropped in the Helipad. The fly was mesmerising. The scenery unparalleled and the journey unforgettable. We walked for maybe a kilometre. We visited the brahmakapala. They say that this is where the forth head of lord Brahma fell down when shiva severed it.There is a Hot water spring . The water is hot. We washed our feet there and headed back for lord Badrinath s darshan. We entered the temple and experienced a very unique vibe. The god there has no form. It is an I carved statue but in our minds we can visualise the image of the lord🙏🏻. After the darshan we boarded the helicopters and headed straight to Kedarnath.Kedarnath is spectacular. It takes another chopper to reach Kedarnath. The story goes thus:When the Pandavas compleated their life span and were looking for a place to meditate. Then Bheema spotted a bull. He realised immediately that it was lord shiva in disguise. He saw that the bull was entering earth. He held it by the tail. But the bull enters the earth leaving only a part of it behind. Lord Shiva applears in front of the Pandavas and tells them that they will attain moksha if they pray there. And thus the Pandavas prayed there and Attained moksham.Do visit these places. They are great spiritually and each place is famous for its scenic beauty.
254,Holy shrine of Shiva,"Kedarnath is one of the 12 holy Jyotirlinga of Shiva and one of the toughest to reach. We visited Kedarnath on June 3rd, 2015. We took helicopter from Phata near Gupt Kashi. It took just about 8-10 minutes to reach Kedarnath. The weather was bad with freezing cold at the top as it was raining.The temple looks majestic with the snowcapped peaks around and the Mandakini river flowing by. We had quick darshan and pooja without any queue as we had the special Pooja token.The place was completely washed out in 2013 floods and is now being rebuilt by the government. The feeling after darshan at Kedarnath just can't be defined. It is just out of the world experience."
255,Guptakashi - Kailash Residency,"I truely consider myself fortunate to visit this place with my family. This creation amidst such beautiful surroundings will leave you awe struck. We took the Pawan Hans helicopter from Phata and landed at Kedarnath on 7 June morning 8:30 AM. You will be allowed to stay for 2 hours. The view of the town just before you land reminds you of the images we all saw on tv in June 2013. The temple stands tall with all its might amongst the destruction. A walk of half kilometer takes you to the temple from the helipad. The entire route is covered with destroyed houses on both sides. It only reminds you that God and Nature are stronger than us human beings. The temple is being restored. We spend a good 20 mins inside the temple and did puja. There was not too much crowd. Then saw the Bheem shila , the huge rock that saved the temple from destruction in 2013. One can buy lunch at the cafeteria next to NIM tents beside the helipad for Rs 70. Basic Rice, Dal, Veg, roti and halwa. One can stay at the tents for Rs100 for 1 bed. Each tent has 10 beds. There is no mobile connectivity. The place has been restored quite much considering the destruction that it went through 2 years back. Needless to say, i wish to visit here again. The trek route is now 22 kms which involves a night halt at Lincholi.Must visit destination for all. Important for those who are travelling by helicopter, since there is no locker facility, please do not carry heavy bags. Also carry woollen clothes as the weather changes"
256,At The Kedar!,Sri Kedarnath Mahadev is one of the most beautiful and the most dangerous trek I have ever been to.We can see a lot of dangerous roads along the side of a river.This 16 kms trekk may be easier to say 16 kms but was not that much easy.After crossing a lot of mountains only we can reach the KEDARNATH TEMPLE situated in the mountains of the great himalayas.Complete white mountain behind the temple gives a tremendous look the the complete view of temple.It feels like mother nature has kept the temple in her lap.A lot of danger I felt there as currently there are a lot of floods coming over there.But yes a positive thing is that the shrine board is taking care of all the followers who so ever come to visit kedarnath temple.Also inside the temple I was able to see the statues of all the Pandavas who built the temple.Yes according to the localites this temple was build by Pandavas.As they found MOKSH overe here just because they found MAHADEV here.So its a place of mahadev and one should definitely visit here specially the one who is SHIVOHOLIC.....BOOOM SHIVAYA.SHIVOHM...
257,Sri Kedarnath - The Ultimate destination,"Its awesome yaar i mean i saw almost every weather in dis place in mrng it was cold, got hot with d sun at 11 after 12 it started raining so heavily n after 3 pm cold started again i mean so much of fog dat we were nt able to see the ppl coming from front approxx 10 steps also.................bt i enjoyed i lot trekking dis place n the temple is like thousands of years old .......so hear i come again in mnth of may .......cheers........."
258,Visit to Baba Kedarnathji,"This is one of the oldest and most popular of the Lord Shiva Temples in India. It is also one of the 4 most important Temples of North India called Chaar Dhaam (Gangotri, Yamnotri, KedarNathji, Badri Nathji). The Terrain to reach the Temple (if you plan to walk from Son Prayag. There are options of visiting the Temple by a Helicopter and Ponies.  In 2013 this region was devastated by floods and thousands of pilgrims and local people lost their lives. This also effected the roads, hotels and other important facilities for pilgrims. But alternatively the state Government has made new walkable road which has increased the walking distance."
259,Abode of Mahadev- Devon ke dev,"If you walks up the complete 14 km stretch uphill........this place is surely going to give you the ultimate satisfaction.... you will feel like in heaven, like at top of the World..... Kedar.... the holy town besides the origin of Mandakini river.... one of the famous four shrines (Chaardhaam) & most important shrine of Hindu mythology.....Most popular among the pilgrims also for the trekkers, surrounded by the snowy peaks.....the ultimate peaceful environment prevails from Dec - Mar when no one stays here due to heavy snow... It feels great..... so many miles away from the crowded cities, away from the pollution, away from the noise, away from the busy day-to-day city life.....Be there.... surely do..... try to go to the lake behind the shrine around 2 km uphill..... an awesome view will welcome you....Dont be amazed to see the naga sadhus taking bath in the ice cold water of the river.... Its common out there.... For puja offerings at the temple you need to get up early in the morning to get a good view of the shrine......"
260,THE ABODE OF LORD SHIVA - KEDARNATH JYOTIRLING,"it was more of a hilly trek than a spiritual visit for me. Started from Dehradun a day before. halt was made at Guptkashi before starting the trek of around 14 km. from Gaurikund. It was an exhausting trek especially because of the chill around. Took me around 5 hrs. to reach there with number of tea breaks wid friends. But, what an experience it was! Snow clad mountains and greenery all around. Definitely the most beautiful trek and temple i ve ever visited.Stayed overnight in a guesthouse within the temple precinct. trekking down next morning required less than 2 hrs. amazing experience.Must visit place in India."
261,Abode of Lord Shiva,"I have been to this temple a no. of times and everytime I go here I can not but wonder at the beauty of this place! From Gaurikund[The base point to start the trek to the temple] the temple is 14 Km away and is worth to walk all the way , because only then one can admire the beauty and splendor of this valley. Ponies are available and also the palki ,, which can be hired if one feels it is a difficult trek.The best time to visit this place is in sept-oct as in summer it is very crowded and  difficult to enter the sanctorium. Best Place to stay is the GMVN cottages though the facilities are very basic."
262,Awesome temple in a crafted setup,"After the floods, following points need to kept in mind while on your Pilgrimage to Kedarnath: 1. The road between Sonprayag and Gaurikund is in a bad state, and only Govt approved ferry vehicles are allowed to be driven on that route. You will have to park your vehicle in Sonprayag itself. 2. The window to travel from Sonprayag to Gaurikund is pretty small.Morning : 6-9 amEvening : 5-7 pmFor the rest of the day, the road remains closed for construction activites. 3. There are very few hotels in Gaurikund. From 72 before the floods, the number of hotels now is just 5. 4. While trekking from Gaurikund to Kedarnath, lodging facitlity is available @ Lancholi, and an another at 1.5 kms before Kedarnath. 5. The lodginf facility @ Kedarnath is provided by the Govt itself. The tents have excellent facilites, including Sleeping Bags, Warm water for bathing, excellent food, and Bio-composting toilets. The tents are maintained by Nehru Mountaineering Foundation. 6. Facilites during th trek routeare excellent now, though the travellers need to be cauttious of their own doing, to try and be at peace with the Nature Gods. !"
263,bliss and peace amidst tough trail,Had a phenomenal darshan of the lord. Families be prepared for sudden change in temperature. Carry adequate warm clothing. Rain coats are recommended for sudden rains and downpours.Carry adequate food suppllies. There are 2 ways to reach kedrnath.  Helicopter (which I recommend) and by walk/ pony. Prior booking of helicopter tickets is a must and it costs about 7k to and fro. Pony costs about 3-4 k per round trip and is tough and difficult. Especially the downward one.
264,Beautiful temple in stunning backdrop,Dharshan is one of the most holy experience one can ever have. I will be short of Words to express the heavenly spiritual feeling.
265,heavenly place,"Best and neatly maintained temple. As it was end of June, not much crowded. Used the Help service and the staff are very helpful and supportive with the regular updates.Worth a visit.Surprisingly there are Free WiFi Zones on the valley.One piece of advice, [which I ignored, I don't want yo to]. After reaching the mail place. Take a deep breathe and spend few minutes to adjust to the height. and don't rush immediately after landing from the helicopter."
266,Love At first sight.,"Had been there thrice. 1982, 2008 & 2012. Wish I can go again. I would like to see how Kedarnath is after the disaster."
267,Top of the world,"Kedarnath is the abode of lord Shiva. This is one of the most sacred temples in India. it is very divine and peaceful. The whole place is so breathtaking  and the trip to the temple is unforgettable. The place is full of positive energy.  An excellent place to visit to have lifetime satisfaction. The natural scenes are so beautiful and we can feel the presence of Lord Shiva is so close to us.We travalled from Mumbai to Dehradun by flight. Then we engaged a cab on hire and reached Gupt Kashi heli-resort. From the resort we reached Kedar shrine by Helicopter (10 minutes flight).To our senior age the travel was tiresome. However Once we stood in front of the shrine our pains were forgotten. we got complete satisfaction when we had the close and clear darshan of Lord shiva there.There are other places like Beam shila, Ganesh ji etc to witness in this shrine.THANKS LORD SHIVA FOR FULFILLING OUR DESIRE"
268,Bam Bam Bhole....,"one of the  most  fulfilling  experience  .....though tough   but the  scenary  around  while  climbing  to  the abode is  beautiful .  new path  constructed  is  very  good  ... at one  side is  mandakini    punctuated  with waterfalls  ....  cannot be described in words  .  all through  there are  dhabas where one  can rest  have tea  some refreshments etc  throughout  17  kms  .   but  one  must  take  pithu  to  carry  luggage  as  climb becomes  tough  as one  crosses  6 kms.   it is  advisable  to book  Garhwal  mandal  hotels  before hand  as it is only accommodation available at the top , besides  tents  by Govt . we had  booked in a packaged  tour  with GMVN  hence it was  wonderful  for  us . guide was there throughout   ....  I recommend their  package  tours startd at  7 am  reached  top  at  2pm  .   as the  temple is  closed  from  3-5pm  so  after  bathing  we reached  the temple at  5 PM  AND  AWESOME  POSITIVITY.Har har Mahdev !!!!   sat  in the shrine  til  aarti at  8pm  .   booked with  mandir  samiti  for  early  morning  abhishek .what  an  experience  only  one  who  had  been there  can  explain it .one  must  do  abhishekam  wc  continues  in the  morning  hours  till  2pm one  must  visit  in the  frst week  of  opening  of temple as  the  scenic  beauty   snow  covered  peaks  give  us  the  feeling  that  it is  indeed  Shiva 's  abode"
269,Shivji's blessings all the way,"The best way to reach is by helicopter. we 8 flew in 2 batches   by Heritage helicopter services. AVOID  PAWAN HANS HELICOPTER AT ALL COST.. THEY CANCEL FOR SOME REASONS.Best is to stay somewhere near Sersi. we stayed about 10 minutes away from helipad in a hotel called Priya ( 1000 Rs a night for two bed.. just ok) as we had to report at 545 am in the morning. we caught hold a of a local priest cum tout  ( named Brijesh Swamy) and paid 1100 Rs  per family for doing  a pooja inside the  mandir.As our pawan hans was cancelled in the last minute, we contacted  a local guy one  Tiwari who arranged tickets at a premium of Rs 1100 per ticket."
270,Satyam Shivam Sundaram! ,"Shri Kedarnath+ Shri Pashupathinath (in Nepal) + Shri Amaranth together constitute one Jyothirlingas.This was the spot where the Adi Shankaracharya took Shiva sayujya. The idol of Adi Shankaracharya here indicates his lost point of journey.Kedarnath is in Uttarakhand State in North India. It is an ancient shrine of more than 6000 years. It is the highest among the 12 Jyothirlingas Shiva temples. Gourikund is a hot water spring where devotees take a holy hot water bath in the chilly climate.  During June 2013 Kedarnath valley was hit with unprecedented flash floods . There were landslide and mudslides with loud peals of thunder.  But the temple withstood the severity of the floods, the temple complex and surrounding area were destroyed, resulting in the death of hundreds of pilgrims and locals. Shops and hotels in Kedarnath were destroyed and all roads were broken. A number of people took shelter inside the temple for several hours, until Indian army airlifted them to safer places.  The route to Kedarnath was washed away in the calamity. The hellish rains have turned Kedarnath into a ghost town. Kedarnath shrine, one of the holiest of Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, and other buildings were damaged.  The deathly silence brooding over Kedarnath due to the  June 2013 calamity was later broken by the chanting of Vedic hymns and prayers resumed at the Himalayan shrine, 86 days after ravaging floods left over 400 people dead in the Kedar valley. The state government was confident that the trekking route to Kedarnath would be completed as early as possible as the snowfall had delayed the repairs. The miraculous incident as per some of the eye witnesses who observed that, one large rock that got carried up to the temple in flood water and settled at the rear side of the Kedarnath Temple prevented destruction of temple which also caused obstruction to the debris, diverting the flow to the sides of the temple avoiding possible damage to the temple. Fortunately by the efforts of the devoted people and by the grace of Lord Shiva the doors of Kedarnath could be opened for devotees 2-3 months later."
271,Truely Heavenly Adobe!!!!!,"Kedarnath Temple is one of the holiest Hindu temples dedicated to Lord  Shiva. It is on the Garhwal Himalayan Range near the Mandakini River. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open only between the end of April (Akshaya Tritriya) to Kartik Purnima (the autumn full moon, usually end of October). Lord Shiva is worshiped as Kedarnath, the 'Lord of Kedar Khand', the historical name of the region.The  temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 14 kilometres uphill trek from Gaurikund. The temple was built by Pandavas and revived by Adi Sankaracharya and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva. Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath The temple is one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham Yatra (Badrinath,Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamunotri). The temple complex, surrounding areas and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, during 2013 Flash Floods. Direct Helicopter service is now available to  Kedarnathduring May/June and September /October months."
272,Heaven Found!,"Lifetime experience. Close to 45 Kms of trek bothways, if travelling with family book a helicopter shall cost around 7500 per person. Preferably take an early morning helicopter as usually it rains after 12 pm and in such a case you may have to stay near the temple overnight. Essential to carry enough cash for such scenario. Temperature can drop significantly in the evening."
273,Kedarnath Yatra 2014,"And while the human heads as semi withered flowers were hunging around me, on the shoulders of tired asleep passengers, the bus was jouncing towards the Himalayas. The magnificence of nature and the Ganges in the distance while meeting lighter greenish Mandakini, carried the power of a completely unusual, beautiful and dangerous world. The highlight of my trip to Asia which I did not want to miss was  this semitransatic journey now. After visiting the most unusual places in South-East Asia and India, my stay in this part of the world was meeting its almost unimaginable finals, named Kedarnath. Legend says that this place, deep in the Himalayan chain on the borders with Tibet, was once a place of ascetizm and meditation to God Narayana Himself and later to many saints. Pilgrims say that this is a place where Shiva gives to the one who manages to get here, the blessing of liberation from all misery.The road to Kedarnath temple is tiring, difficult and dangerous. You must first get on the dusty Indian bus early in the morning, before the dawn, at least somewhere in Rishikesh. It must be the end of May to October. Temple is open only five or six months a year. There are often rains and landslides on the way to the temple, especially in May. And now it's May. Uncertainty whether I will be able to reach the temple lasted for several months. Not even on the day when I went on the trip, was any certainty weather I will successfully complete the pilgrimage and see the thousands of years old sacred stone representing the Holy Trinity .. Shiva, Parvati and Ganesha. It is believed that just sight at this sacred stone or linga and touch can heal, recover, bless the future and may open the gate to the heavenly realm.  The roadtrip is far, somewhat 460 km from Delhi. When reaching the village Gauri Kund with healing hot spring waters, one should take bath before hiking uphill for 17 km, to prevent muscles inflamation or something worse. Only then the real journey to the heart of mountains begins. Deep and far away from the world we know into the completely new, unknown, unusual world. Someone can see it, some can feel it, some can reflect aboutbut no one stayes indifferent. There is something of Moo continent in it, or something Lemurian. The trail is paved with stone blocks most of the way. Remains of the old trail which mainly dissapeared in the severe landslides last year, along with tens of thousands of lives, are visible and at least partly still walkable to the shrine. After six or seven kilometers one encounters a small steel wooden bridge over the river Mandakini, made this year, which leads to a new trail, few kilometers longer from and much more difficult to climb then the old one. Untill this point you have already passed a couple of refreshment stations where you can drink tea or take some food that is served by government officials, for free, and then the real difficult trail begins. There, it seems that Himalayas start to show some of its mystical magnificent hidden side. Suddenly, out of nowhere storm and rain started. Since I did not have any umbrella or raincoat with me, I took shelter under the penthouse with benches.  Already, on the way to it, sadhus have warned me to hurry to get there before the rain starts. Near by, guards, policemen and some pilgrims were sitting around the bonfire to warm themselves. They invited me to the fire, it has suddenly gotten cold as snow glaciers are very close. They said, it will not rain, not to worry. Acknoledgin it, trusting their words i continued the hike, exchanging smiles and good wishes with the team around the fire.  Rain began to fall. The weather got colder and colder. I had a thin jacket and pullover and very thin pants. When I went from Delhi there was over 40 degrees Celsius. In Rishikesh over 30. They said it will be cold in the Himalayas. And now the rain. Fifteen minutes after, the storm that came out of nowhere, was gone into somewhere. It disappeared. Quickly, the clouds began to disperse. It was neither so cold as before. We walked over the glaciers. The trail was becoming increasingly steep and harder to climb. Maybe it was the middle of the trail, when a group of pilgrims joined me. They were very enthusiastic, one was constantly shouting Jay Mahadev, Glory to God Shiva ... Somehow they were funny, cracking jokes, making me lough, asking where I am from and how I am here. That day perhaps two more white people and me were true attraction on the pilgrimage path. We were the only foreigners. If so, you will out of the blue hear solicit voices saying: ""Hello, Which country?"".  My mantra then became, ""Montenegro"" and nobody knew what I said, and everyone asked for additions to that answer, ""From Europe, across Italy, near Croatia, Serbia, Djokovic, and Albania ... "" all associations i could in the moment think of to help them understand where I'm from. One sweaty, tired, chubby face of a young Indian man who was hardly breathing how exhausted he was, which glanced with such a radiance in a moment upon seeing me, will remain engraved in my consciousness as a living image of grotesqueness of living and perceiving the world. At this point he briefly forgot how hard his clamber along the Himalayas was. The picture of some far land out there, who knows where, popped up into his imagination with a look which revealed how much he had no clue of it. Then rapidly previously seen suffering face, returned as he continued his hike. Finally, since at least 100 and certainly a lot more people have asked you this question, I wanted to be from Germany, as partly I am, but could not say that I'm from there when I was born somewhere, here. Thus it continues and in the moment when you just want peace and withdrawal into yourself and Himalayas, another screemed question comes slapping your mind again. Well I controled myself to not to fall into the southern temper and explosive Aquarius's one, well dear brothers, enough with it I come from God as we all do, from the Only ONE! When I was on the verge of power thinking that this hardship and strein of steep hiking my body will not be able to endure and perhaps I will not succeed to the shrine, coz I do not dwell in gyms and I am not too physically active, although by some strangeness my body has great  strength and stamina, the dog appeared. A black dog with few beige dots, out of nowhere. He began following me and almost pushing me by sniffing my knees and feet. I felt the strength in him, as he would convey the strenth to me to continue. I felt that he lead me, because I did not know the exact trail line. The trail was not finished, so on some parts it disappears and appears. He knew the path. He followed me until I came to paved trail with miraculously regained powers. Then suddenly he disappeared. We gave him some biscuits, we caressed him on the way. And then he vanished. On one point i finally took a guide-carrier to carry my bag. Though bag was barely 4kg now it weighted at least ten times more. If i didnt take him, I do not think I would be able to come to the temple. I felt free without the bag and jacket. Weather was getting better. A Nepalese, Ram Singh a very vital and agile guide kept encouraging me with ""No problem, no problem, just a little bit more. Bit more."" A ""little bit"" was still a three-hour walk, some 6 km climb on the very steep way. Above the choppers buzzed back and fort bringing the flying pilgers to the Shrine, but i did not envy them, i felt some of bad karmas must burn through the sacrifice im making. In that, a bit mazochistic mood i did get new powers to step further and further and further. But well, with this beautiful procession of people in front and behind me, with their sights that poured energy onto me, with almost a scream of jubilation ""happy journey"" that one of 15 or 16 year old girl casted at me, with a beautiful face of surpise coz perhaps for the first time she sees a white woman, I was encouraged and the pilgrimage became easier at these moments. A large number of young Indians with their parents were pilgrims but too an amazing number of very old people. An average age of old women and men who walked was at least 70 years and certainly many were closer to their 80s. Slowly, with their sticks, they plowed step by step to their worshiped Deity. In them I saw genes of glorious and spiritual India, of the ancient past which still was alive. Their eyes like pearls shined reflecting to me a long hard service in life and work but a light heart and soul that only could have brought them this far. How would I love to be able to change it all, their wrinkles and old bodies into new and young ones, their suffering and severe fates into fairy tales of beauty, their poverty into wealth ... but now I only was able to put few rupies into their small, calloused hands so they may buy some tea or chapati (Indian bread).Finally, we were at the plateau in front of the temple of Kedarnath. There I did not feel altitude sickness, nor dizziness or shortness of breath, I felt completely balanced and fortunate to finally be here. And when I was just about to conciously try to intune my inner self into this moment as the part of these splendid mountains a young man with a camera came to me asking for an interview about my journey and belief. I talked spontainously. He then gladly presented the whole commune with who he was here on pilgrimage, making a movie about the pilgrimage. Noticing me long before on the path, only now he found courage to address me out of curiosity how someone from Europe and some small Montenegro, can be here to see God. Indians are very respectful toward foreigners who are on pilgrimages. In a moment one becomes a Deity in their eyes, and stays as such. You can feel the deep sincere respect they do not just only express by words but with their most penetrating and beautiful eyes. Encouraged by this picture, a group of some 30 young men, all in black with huge turbans along with few old ladies with them, aproached me too for photogtraphing. Actually, while climbing the trail coz of fatigue in a half-sleep state I was not aware of how many mobile flashes were turned towards me. I stood like a rod when they asked me to be photographed. I was the most popular unknown person at the trail that day.Well, when the popularity and media attention finally ended, I felt that it is high time to enter the temple. A few moments more and I will see the 12th jyoti shining Shiva linga. In India there are only 12 of these special stone deities of Shiva. If the lamp is lit behind this stone the stone turnes into glowing transparent orange color and one is able to see the lamp that burns behind. These shrines are known for thousands of years and are characterized as the most powerful energy points in India and abroad. It is said that if someone manages to visit all 12 shrines in one lifetime, the person will go back to God after that life is ended.This was my 12th. After 14 years as my 12 shrines pilgrimage lasted, the circle was closing. One year in one month four shrines i managed to visit. It was an action of 17 flights within India for less than a month. But this time was special, this was the most difficult trip, i waited for two years to do.The temple was as most temples are, with well known pleasant atmosphere. Touching the sacred stone provoked few tears that perhaps this is something special, that perhaps perhaps soon I will be with God. I do not know what happened but from that moment I did not feel fetigue at all. Tremendous vitality and happiness was in me. At one moment in front of the temple, while talking with a guide whether to stay the night in the camp or to go back to Gauri kund, meaning 17 km again downwards, I saw the sky and nature being immensely alive again. I looked around, magnificent green slopes of the Himalayas, with snow and glaciers, with chirping birds suddenly resembled and resonated oceanic atmosphere and climate. It felt as behind those mountains there must be the vast sea. Everything was indicating to an unknown Ocean. It was a magical moment when, as  a possible transmittance from peaks of the surrounding mountains, I got something like a vision. The picks were resembling silent beings who suddenly resonated with my heart and consciousness. For a moment i was in a very special realm of Himalayas, there somewhere behind. What is deeper in the Himalayas? I thought I need to go searching for these waters but I Ram Singh woke me up from this strange daydream telling me to hurry to have a lunch and a little rest. He said it's best to get back to Gauri kund with him now because it will be very cold here tonight. So i followed his advice. Heading back after a couple of hours walk I remembered the dog whom I have met while climbing, and the dog appeared, lying next to the bench where we sat for a few minutes. We went on. He was gone. The night found me bathing in the dark under the pipe conducting a warm soothing water. Gauri kund or the Golden sprin was the name of Parvati, Lord Shiva's female energy. While less than a meter away from the rapids of river Mandakini, despite the nocebos from the frightened locals and a small hotel's host where i was staying that night, i trusted that my angels accompanyed me while taking  greatly desired bath. If I have managed to cross into another world of Himalayas and Kedar after 34 kms up and down, I will surely not be taken by the waters of Mandakini River now. The next day not a single muscle was convulsed. I was a little bit tired and my feet and legs hurt but that was all. Water has made its inpact on my body. I thought I'd have inflamed muscles for days, but just after two days, fully rested, I was on the plane to Abu Dhabi and Belgrade, and home to Montenegro. Himalayas almost unreal, almost like a dream, were now within me."
274,Amazing hike to Kedarnath,"Kedarnath temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river, Kedarnath is located in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April and November. Kedarnath is a holy Hindu town located in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand in India. It is one of the Char Dhams located in the Himalayas. Kedarnath is situated at an astonishing height of 3584 meter above sea level near the head of Mandakini River. The Kedarnath temple lies amidst the majestic snow-capped Garhwal Himalayan ranges and is thronged by thousands of tourists each year."
275,Awesome experience,"No one can define the spiritual halo of this holy temple in words. One of the 12 Jytorlingas, the Kedarnath temple is more than 1000 years old. You can only visit the temple in the monts when the shrine is open. Normally May to June and October are the best times to visit. Avoid rainy seasons. I have travelled solo and didnot encounter any proble pre and post the incident. However it is better to have company. You may get taxi or bus from Haridwar or Rishikesh and reach Kedarnath. If you dont want to exert yourself, you may make a stopover at Rudraprayag and explore the place. Take requisite medicines with you. People with heart problems and High Blood Pressure must take extra precaution. Helicopter service is available from Phata also."
276,A Divine place,"If you want to experience the presence of God, look no further. Kedarnath is the abode of Lord Shiva, the destroyer and it is one place where nature meets God in the most beautiful way. The long trek to the Mandir itself is both cleansing and exhausting and one that will completely rejuvenate you. The beauty of the mountains that surround you, the river that gurgles along in places and thunders in some others, the echo of the birds in perfect rhythm with the water striking the river bed and the rocks that pave its path; it's all glorious! It's a must visit place but do be careful after the havoc that was caused half a decade back. Jai Bhole Baba!"
277,I was luckiest to visit the temple in 2010 with my parents and family,"you come all the way to be blessed by lord kedarnath ... there can be nothing to dislike , one just has to forget all the worldly issues and lose oneself to mental and spiritual dedication . Think of lord shiva , think of eternity , peace , divine aura of the lord"
278,Heaven on Earth,"Peaceful and crafted location. The humongous mountains in the backdrop adds to the beauty of the place. you can also take a small 3.5 kms trek to the Chorabari Glacier and also an ~8 kms trek to Vasuki taal, from the temple."
279,Blissful Peak !!!,"If you planning to go on Kedarnath Yatra, please take on followings:1. Check the weather landslide occur quite frequently.2. Pre-book your stay because thousands are people coming for Yatra and hotels are quite limited.3. Please bring your gloves, winter clothing, raincoat and umbrella.4. You may reach the place by bus or cab. Price for government buses is INR645/- but tickets sold out fast during peak season in May. 5. You may take bus from Rishikesh to Kedarnath. 6. Mostly people start their Yatra as early as 3am. Temple close by 3pm. If you reach before 3pm you can offer gangs gel or honey. After that you can only pray from far. Queue are very long. You might wait to 1-2 hours so start your journey early.7. You may walk on foot which takes 18KM or hire horse, people can carry you or take helicopter.8. Each stops there are tea stall so food you can have along the way. Same applies toilet, quite clean. Bring hand shampoo."
280,A trek with masses to Kedarnath Temple - and then beyond it,Kedarnath is now safe and provided with all facilities. Free Wi-Fi is also available.Only BSNL mobile connection is available.
281,entry to heaven,"Went there with my family last year on a tour to Kedarnath and Badrinath. Really must say the journey to kedarnath mandir from gaurikund is really tough. There are four ways of transportation to there : 1. By Helicopter the fastest and safest way.  2. By Kandha where two people will carry you in carraige especially for old people who fear helicopter. 3. By horse for teens, young and mid age people. 4. By walk only for young and strong ones. The way up is 11km and the oxygen quantity is really low so, even in helicopter too its dangerous as the weather changes every minute. During our travel it rained and hailed heavily 2-3 times. Even my brother who had asthma had nose bleeding and my mother had fits due to severe cold we had to stop by one of the tents and warm ourselves and continued our journey. After reaching to the temple you can literally feel you have reached heaven and in front of God himself. The view of snow covered mountains with massive temple structure is awesome. I feel the spiritual sense in the air."
282,Kedarnath special features,"The whole range of mountains are so high in vibrations with the hushhh sound of the huge rivers that flow. It will take a person to higher consciousness itself.Due to the last year flood, situation is very tough for people to go to temple. It is good to go on horse, as it was raining and work still going on in most of the places, it is of high risk. With the grace of divine, it will happen. AS all the buidings have collapsed, basic food is available by government for all the people who work there (buidling work)."
283,Heaven falls in Kedarnath !!!!!!,We visited the Shrine just before the mayhem that shook the country. I went there along with my mother. We stayed at the GMVN Hotel at GauriKund. The journey to GauriKund from Dehradun was horrendous courtesy the Bishwanath Sewa bus Service. Our luggages were damaged by the bus operators as they foolishly kept kerosene containers on our luggage and the containers tumbled and all our belongings were damaged. The food we carried had to be thrown away. The roads were in a very bad shape due to heavy traffic congregation. The large luxury buses plying has contributed to the damage of the roads. The erosion of roads was visible as we traveled towards Gaurikund.  Reaching Gaurikund we realized that one has to carry a lot of cash as there is no ATM. The temple committee was just there to collect money in any form they could. The facilities along the path to the Kedarnath temple were very less. There was scarcity of lights along the path at night. The might of the Himalayas can felt while walking through the mountains. Reaching the temple one forgets the pain of getting there as the presence of GOD can be felt. The policemen and the priests were very rude. One thing that stuck me was that you cannot the massive temple structure from a distance due to the lodges and structures created to mint money.  We are waiting for the normalization of the area and we would surely go back once again to the Kedarnath Temple.
284,Natural Beauty at its best,"Absolute Peace and comfort one can feel after such a long trek to reach here. Be ready to completely mesmerized by the beauty of nature and the satisfaction of reaching here in this spiritual and breathtaking nature's abode. Take your time and sit somewhere for a while to feel all your worries go away and find some solace inside you. Do get to know the legend about the temple and try to go to temple earliest in the morning to get the best time for the darshan. Do keep some rain protecting cloths as weather can change anytime.DO keep some dry fruits with you to have in midway as food is scarce in the way and its costly too, approximately double the normal price with the limited option of Maggi, chai, and parantha. It takes about 6-7 hours for a fit person to trek the complete path so plan accordingly. After halfway, the trekking slope is steep. It's the best spiritual place I have ever been to. Jai Baba Kedar."
285,What a beauty of nature,"After great damage done due to disaster of rain 2 years back its very very tough now to reach there but thanks to helicopter service provide at cost of 7000 Rupees return trip charge from Gupt kashi its easily assessable , Just 500 meter wolk from helipad to temple, everything surrounding temple is ruined but temple itself is standing tall as it was before so seeing it one can firmly believe that god is present there. If you go with full faith Lord Shiva will definately fulfill your wish."
286,Abode of Lord Shiva,Management at the mandir as well as at booking counter is pathetic... After so much of effort you find only pushing and fake pujas inside.. You will not find any divinity inside.. After so much of effort you find it waste.. Book helicopter ride in advance otherwise it is very tough.. You get free VIP darshan with helicopter booking... That means you breach the line but cannot avoid the rush in peak seasons...
287,DIVINE EXPERIENCE,"We planned this trip six months back when my son was born we were so excited waiting for June 2019 to come. The temple opens in mid-May every year for the darshan. We started our journey from Gurgaon and we reached our first-night stay destination Kotdwar. We again started our onwards journey through rough roads mostly filled with dust and rocks we were saved by our SUV. We reached Sonprayag in the evening and got stuck in a huge traffic jam. We didn't have advance accommodation booked so we took a u-turn and found a beautiful campsite. We took a good half an hour rest and then headed for dinner. The dinner was not that good as per our expectations but since we were hungry we grabbed it and went back into our tent and started preparing to sleep. Someone suggested starting early in the morning to avoid the traffic jam and probability for getting the parking slot were high. Finally, we started at 4:30 am towards Sonprayag and we just traveled for 4 km and got stuck in a huge jam. After struggling for 2 long hours we managed to reach the parking and we parked our car. Our luggage was huge so we tried to take only the necessary stuff {Warm clothes, medicines, raincoat, jacket, torch, and some snacks}. We packed all the stuff in our small sacks and started the trek towards Gaurikund. From the parking slot, you have to walk till the taxi stand which is at a distance of 3 km. Once we reached the taxi stand there was a huge queue so we decided to take a walk. The local taxis take 20 INR per seat to reach Gaurikund. We started our trek again and we got a lift in the midway. We reached Gaurikund and had some tea biscuits to keep us light. We reached to the pony checkpoint were we booked two horses for two people in the group. Rest of three including me decided to walk. We crossed a few kilometers and realized the trek was tough so we started motivating each other and continued walking. We took a few breaks in between had Maggie and tea which came out to be the best option to have. We kept hydrating ourselves by having natural mineral water coming from the mountains. The sightseeing was mesmerizing which gave us the energy to keep going. You can find small vendors and shops for snacks all trek. Crossing all the main stops we reached base camp at 6 pm taking 8 hrs for the trek including our small breaks. We had booked tent accommodation for the night stay. We took rest for some time and then walked ahead till the temple for the darshan. You can sight the temple from a km ahead and from base camp to temple the road is straight. We reached the temple and joined a long waiting queue. We stood 3 hrs in the queue and finally, we did the very quick darshan at 10:45 pm. We took a few memorable snaps and entered a looking like a restaurant. Again a long queue for the table and after struggling for 30 mins we got the place to sit when we ordered the food they said the food is being prepared. We could not wait for further so we canceled the ordered and ask him to get is Maggie. We had the hot Maggie after a long wait and headed towards the base camp. No light was there so we were saved by our carried torch lights. We reached the tent and slept in the provided sleeping bags. We were so tired that we slept within some seconds and then we had a plan to wake up early morning and start our journey back. We all decided to walk by foot and taking a few breaks we reached Gaurikund in 5 hrs. The return journey if compared was not so tedious. We had decided to take a bath in Gaurikund in the mighty Ganges but because of coordination issues, we could not take the dip. Please don't expect mobile phone working in the maximum journey it works after base camp. No ATM at the temple or Gaurikund. You must carry enough cash for this journey and a must power backup. Keep yourself light by only carrying necessary things which I have mentioned including the cash. After reaching to Gaurikund taxi stand we had to wait again in the queue for 2 hrs. We took the taxi till Sonprayag. We then took the holy dip in Sonprayag and started the trek again till the car parking. We got into the car and reached Rudraprayag at a distance of 33 km. We stopped and had a good dinner slept well till morning had good breakfast and started our journey again till Shivpuri. We decided to do the river rafting. We did a good adventure and started again till Haridwar for a dinner break and from Haridwar, we headed towards Gurgaon completing our yatra. The roads and arrangements for the yatra need huge improvement. You can also get a chopper ride to Kedarnath temple from Sonprayag by booking it in advance. Chopper ride Sonprayag - Kedarnath - Sonprayag - 5000 INRHorse ride Sonprayag - Kedarnath - 2300 INR (Govt rates)Horse ride Kedarnath - Sonprayag - 1500 INR (Govt rates)Tips:The suggestions if you want to trek would start walking before a month for good practice. Do a health checkup since oxygen reduces as we climb up. Carry enough cash don't expect any ATM machines Take raincoats, snacks, torches, medicines and warm clothes Do online registration to avoid long queue"
288,Heavenly Experience,"Kedarnath is one of the 12 holy Jyothirlingas of Lord Shiva and one of the toughest to reach. I visited Kedarnath on June 20th, 2015, got helicopter service from Phata near Gupt Kashi. Due to weather being not good, got to stay longer to visit Lord Kedarnath Ji, though the travel time from Premair is 10 minutes to reach Kedarnath. After reaching Kedarnath, weather again turned into freezing cold at the top and it started raining. It's one of the Temple which will change the life of a person/family. River Mandakini flow by the temple. I was disappointed with the priests as they were doing business inside once they start the pooja activities. I had a token for special darshan with Rs. 1100/- to avoid queue, it is said by management team out there it should be free of cost for doing pooja and darshan on special darshan ticket. So, be aware while visiting and prepare to discuss with management for pooja activities."
289,Very Lucky,"The first feeling you have as soon as you reach the temple is the close proximity to the Divine!The ancient temple, set amidst the snow capped mountains indeed seems a perfect abode of the Lord Shiva!!The Kedarnath Temple alongwith the nearby Shankaracharya Samadhi Temple and the Bhairavanth Temple are a must visit.You can also book a special aarti , either through the temple committe office located in the temple complex, or in advance through the main office located in Rishikesh/Dehradun.One suggestion though the trek route from Gaurikund to Kedarnath has been totally spoilt by the horsemen. The entire route is filthy with Horse waste. Avois , if possible."
290,most powerfull form of mahadev,The Kedarnath Temple is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga temples in India. It is situated in the Backdrop of the Himalayas and one is struck by its beauty. This temple is also closed during Winter. The walk to the temple from Gaurikund is tiring but offers delightful views
291,Divine Experience ..Ultimate in Devbhoomi,"Post 2013 things around valley in terms of lodging, travelling via trek or pony have changed so be mindful of consulting an expert genuine guide for the same. If you are travelling via chopper please ensure you get your photometric & registration done at Phatta else for other travellers same can also be collected from Guptakashi too. Its a must so no escape to it. With Baba's blessings it was my 2nd visit post 2012 so I can identify the enroute differences. One of the most sacred, heavenly experience. It cannot be better than this. Valley is so beautiful that 1 can easily experience inner peace & soul.One request to all travellers please don't leave garbage behind, only dump it in desginated places."
292,Holiest of the Holy Hindu shrines,"Do not miss an opportunity to do this mesmerizing pilgrimage tour of the Almighty Shiva. The climb is certainly difficult & a bit frightening at times but the experience is simply divine & beyond anyone's imagination. The mountains, the ferocious Mandakini waters & the sharp & steep valleys leaves you spellbound & completely exhausted taking snaps of nature's splendour. The actual temple built by panda as is an architectural wonder which is supposed to be existing foe 5000 years but the huge rock which actually grounded itself behind the temple & bifurcated the strong water current in 2013 is a virtual miracle. A must visit."
293,Avoid travelling in monsoon season and Pray for trapped pilgrims,"Comfortably tucked between the mighty peaks of the Himalayas, the temple looks really cozy. Still overcoming the great tragedy due to floods in 2013, people are still as enthusiastic as ever. We visited during the end of peak season and before the onset of monsoons, hence were really lucky to find very less crowd. Kedarnath isn't just about the temple, but also about the beauty of Himalayas. I guess the temple is said to be the most powerful just because of it's location. It is hard not to fall in love with the place. I would recommend people visiting to just stroll around for a bit and just appreciate all the beauty this place has to offer."
294,Lord's abode,Kedarnath is a Hindu temple dedicated to god Shiva. It is on the Garhwal Himalayan range. The journey from the car park to the temple was around 23km each way by horseback. It was certainly an experience i've never experienced before...from a rugged path..to virtually being on edge around the bends of the mountain range... The young guys that accompanied the horses and our group to the top to reach the temple were absolutely amazing...even after their 24km on foot guiding the horses up..they got us to the top in 5hours which was brilliant and we were able to offer our prayers to Lord Shiva.  The journey downhill took similar time but at this point certainly had a sore bum from the saddle of the horse...This journey was epic and worth every bit of pain..time and patience ...the highlight of my journey was seeing the Himalayas in the background.This temple forms part of the Hindu Pilgrimage 'Char Dham' consisting of Yamunotri... Gangotri...Kedarnath and Badrinath...I did all four and was blessed to have done this journey before my 40's and as many people say 'I was lucky the weather was on my side and nothibg got in our way' as this area does suffer from landslides and rockfalls during the monsoon...A spiritual and satisfying journey that makes you forget about your worries and absorbed the beautiful surroundings
295,Seems to be in Lord Shiva's Kailash,"Kēdārnāth Mandir (Kedarnath Temple) is a Hindu temple (shrine) dedicated to Lord Shiva. Located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river, Kedarnath is located in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritriya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigrahas (deities) from Kedarnath temple are carried down to Ukhimath and where the deity is worshiped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Lord Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedar Khand', the historical name of the region.[1]"
296,The Great Jyothirlinga,"Great shrine of Lord Shiva, and the most difficult one of the twelve  Jyothirlingas in terms of access- a place in Snow-Clad himalayas, at an altitide of over 3800 metres, tempearatures as low as 3 degrees in nights and  where oxygen levels fall  below 65%- it is truly arduous and  strenuous but a very satisfying at the end. Helicopter, Pony and trek are the main options to reach the temple from the base camp Gaurikind at a distance of 14 KM. Entire trek path is well laid with stones and the ascent someplaces  is very steep.Porters are also available for carrying our baggage and the best season is said to be Mid May to end June - before rains start. Plenty of food joints on the way and it is suggested to consume lot of fluids while on trek."
297,Abode of Shiva,"It is one of the 'Dhams' amongst the Four Dhams in the region. A trek of 14 Kms. to the temple atop a mountain seems a bit too much before one embarks on it, but, once at the top, even the views seem worth the exertion let alone the temple the sits in the midst of a heavenly setting.However, it has become quite crowded over the years especially if you start your trek late. We started out at around 5.30 AM and found out that we were late by at least an hour and could not beat the crowd. The trek starts from Gaurikund, which is quite a small place and comprises mainly of small, cheap hotels. During the season, even the smallest of rooms are available at no less than INR 800 per night. All along the route, there are small eateries and tea stalls that sell all kinds of stuff and all of it is at as much as 100% mark-up on their regular price.One thing that we were warned about was the rain in the afternoon at around 1600-1700 hrs. and we did buy raincoats for the same, and, as warned, it did rain and the tea-stall owner, where we hid ourselves for the duration, told us that it happens almost unfailingly every day.All things apart, a visit to the temple is definitely worth all the money and all the exertion.Do note that the temple is closed during the winters and opens only in the beginning of May."
298,har har mahadev,The temple is located in the midst of the Himalayan Ranges. A view of the snow capped peaks is visible in the backdrop. The temple is not an architectural masterpiece but a spiritual treat. The self formed Shiv Linga is a place of worship. The aarti happens every evening and the sound of the bells is mesmerising. If a pooja is booked then you can sit inside the temple sanctum and perform the religious ceremony. These poojas are performed through the night.There is ample place to sit outside the Temple and experience the bliss of meditation. The temple is difficult to reach. There is no transport. From Gaurikund you can walk or take a horse. Chopper service is available from helipads near Guptkashi and costs approximately Rs 6000-8000. Online booking is available and it is advisable to book in advance as the availability is limited. Of course take off of the helicopters is subject to weather conditions.
299,Kedarnath Dham,"Kedarnath Is One Of The 12 Jyotirlingas Of Lord Shiva. It Is Mentioned In The Holy Scriptures That Lord Shiva Is Himself Present In The Form Of Divine Light In These Twelve Jyotirlingas. In Hindi, If We Breakup The Word Jyotirlinga : It Comprises Of The Word Jyoti(Meaning Divine Light) & Linga(Meaning The Non-Physical Form Of Lord Shiva).Its Indeed A Blessing To Visit This Divine Place Amidst The Himalayas.  To Reach The Kedarnath Temple, People Can Either Walk In Fott Or Take A Horse Ride(Every Horse Is Accompanied By A Care-Taker) For A Nominal Charge."
300,Alive is awesome........,"Lord Shiva, the powerful and fascinating deity of the Hindu Trinity,  is worshipped as kedarnath- the Lord of kedarnath khand.Amidst the dramatic mountainscapes of the majestic Kedarnath range stands one of the twelve Jyotilingas of Lord Shiva. It's holiest shrine of the Hindu and a sacred pilgrimage too..The cascading Mandakini River, verdant landscapes,  the mesmerizing vistas and splendid sceneries in the form of the snow-fed mountains, rhododendron forests, and salubrious environment make the place truly enchanting.The devotees can experience a great peace of mind and undertaking a spiritual trip here always rekindles human beings faith in the almighty.Kedarnath is a tremendous space. The serenity, silence and purity penetrated my consciousness. The climb, the altitude and the desolate beauty of that place left me breathless."
301,Simply breathtaking (literally),"If one believes in the Divine then this is a place that must be visited.  I am not sure if I can even write a review of this place as it is beyond words.  The is the PLACE, it is all about Lord Shiva.  It is the first Jyothirlingam in the set of twelve.  It is believed that Shiva himself lived here.  This temple was established by Adhi Shankara.   The temple in itself is not very big like the temple of the southern part of India.  But just by the sheer presence of the greatest saints this place is so Divine.  The lingam in the form of a small hood of the mountain is the main deity and poojas are performed on a regular basis.  The temple I understand is open only during the period from June-July to Oct-November as it is extremely cold.  On a daily basis the temple opens at 4.00 AM and closes at around 8.00 PM.  One can touch the Shiva lingam and pray.  The sanctum is very small and can be very difficult for many people to stand.  The temple is set on the background of the Kedarnath cliffs and one can sit in meditation in front of the people and feel the presence of the Divine.  After the 2013 floods accommodation and other facilities are bare minimum.  One has to prepare very well for the Yatra.  While trekking the 18 kms route (new way) is the most auspicious way to reach the temple from Gouri Kund, there are also helicopter rides that are availble cost around INR 2500/- one side.  Pony are also available which cost around INR 1500/- for the round trip.  One has to remember that the Pony will not come near the temple.  A walk of around 1.5 kms is required to reach the temple from where the Pony stops.  The walk pr the pony ride is a journey that will be remember for a lifetime, as we pass across the majestic rivers and soaring mountains.  All along the way there are Bio-toilet facilities and medical assistance.  The pathway is kept neat and tidy by workers who continuously keen cleaning the way for the pilgrims.  One has to be extremely fit to make the journey to Kedarnath and once done, it is worth a lifetime and one step closer to the Divine."
302,Not Just any spiritual Place..,There is nothing I can say about the temple coz I am noone to describe this place.... Just go and have blessings of lord Shiva.... Jai BholeNath Jai Shiv Shambhu...
303,om nama shivay,"The Temple is without doubt absolutely amazing. The surrounding view is drop dead beautiful. The experience is overwhelmingly awesome. But there are other aspects people don't know about- for Kedarnath visit you have two options (i) helicopter (ii) treck. Take The Helicopter, no matter how expensive it is. For trecking, one needs to first reach Sonprayag which in itself will be a challenge considering long traffic jams (5-8 hours). So leave your car at earlier towns like Guptkashi or Augastmuni etc and take a taxi to Sonprayag. if you take a local taxi, then you won't have to worry about traffic jams and parking in Sonprayag (extremely limited parking). Travel as light as possible. it is impossible to find a place to stay at Sonprayag. One single store room (without bed, but with quilts) without bathroom costed us ₹5000 for 6 hours. Important- get your biometric registration done online for Kedarnath travel. It is mandatory. Either do it online for free or get in line from 4 AM at tue sole registration counter where it will take 2-4 hours to get yourself registered. After 2013 tragedy, the registration is mandatory. Carry ID proof. For treck- 2 options- treck on legs or take a pony. Advice-start at 4 AM sharp. Remember there is no place to stay near the temple so travel light and wear warm clothes. Only lucky ones get a mattress or tent, at the top to spend the night. So start early to finish early.Now the treck does not start from Sonprayag it starts from gaurikund which is 5 kms away from Sonprayag and only three options to reach there. Treck yourself (exhausting), pony (uncomfortable), Govt. Cabs which charge ₹20 per person but there is a very very long queue for it (wastage of 2-3 hours minimum). All three options are equally frustrating so chose as per your situation. Treck is 14 kilometres. But absolutely beautiful views. Worth doing. take a pony for upward treck. You can do the return treck yourself. Pony ride is absolutely uncomfortable. But the entire trecking stretch is full of ponies (more than you can imagine), pony dung, pony piss and random ponies, and this makes walking extremely dangerous and difficult. Treck takes 7-10 hours on foot and 5-7 hours on pony (one side).Now you reach the temple- absolutely amazing. No questions. Downright awesome. But- there is again a queue. Average waiting time-3-6 hours. (Try and buy the priority temple visit slip for ₹2100 per person from helicopter ticket sellers). Or catch some local priest he will charge around 1-2000 per person and get you somewhere ahead in line. Remember there is almost no place to stay near the temple and only lucky ones or those with excessive money or with prior arrangements through local government authorities get tents. However food is available there.Now the return treck. Its comparatively easy.It is possible to do the entire thing and return back on the same day. It will however be exhausting and you will have to begin as early as possible  in the morning.Conclusion- plagued with mismanagement you will hate every second of the journey till you reach the temple and see the Shiv Lingam. Trust me when i say this, it is so beautiful and peaceful at the temple that all your troubles will melt and you will be refreshed to do the journey again and again and again."
304,Out of the World,"One of the most beautiful and memorable trips that Iv ever had and one of the most astonishing pilgrimages that Iv ever been to. Kedarnath stands as a testimony to to time and history. When you step out of the chopper at 4th he main site of Kedarnath, you are awestruck....speechless! I guess all the highest appreciation,  love and emotions are best expressed without words. This,  no matter how well I put to get her my words..... I will never be able to define what I felt like at Kedarnath. However,  in my entire life visiting Kedarnath was magical, it was something that Iv never ever felt anywhere. It was pure delight, truth,  consciousness or as you may call in Sanskrit  Sat-Chit-Ananda. I highly recommend this place to every spiritual seeker. It will help you elevate your spiritual levels.  This place is also recommend for nature lovers,  they will experience a divine natural beauty which they may not have experienced ever and I recommend this place to all those who seek peace and calmness within."
305,"""KEDARNATH-my best adventurer journey""","The best place I have seen in my life. Nothing can beat the view, beauty of nature at its best. If there was once thing that annoyed me that was the sound of the bloody helicopters."
306,Kedarnath - What a phenomenal experience!,"The chopper landed with aggressive whirs. As I came out, the majestic Kedarnath removed its veil before my eyes. I stood there enthralled amidst bewitching snow-capped mountains. This Hindu holy town in Rudraprayag District, Uttarakhand, India, is located at an altitude of 3581metres [11748 ft] above sea level near the head of the river Mandakini. Kedarnath, shrouded more with myths than history, is swarmed with devout pilgrims as well as tourists.    I reached there by helicopter only to view Himalayan elegance from above. One can, of course, hike 14 kms or, alternatively, travel by horse or palanquin,  from Gaurikund which has a good road connectivity. The steep incline along mountainous road has a  seductive beauty.   Apart from its religious loftiness, the place could have beckoned more nature-lovers, if the authorities  had a little more concern for preserving its immaculate beauty that is ravaged by the locals as well as those who flock there."
307,Kedarnath - Toughest Destination in Chardham Yatra,"We stayed at Guptkashi waiting to board a chopper as the weather turned for worse during the first week of June 16. Flights would stop on slight indication of inclement weather &  highly unpredictable  is weather always, in this mountain state. The HEART was committed not to go back without 'darshans' of Lord Kedarnath. Daily detailed weather forecasts reviews on net came very handy at this point of time. Accordingly reached phata helipad at 0530 in the morning & Pawan Hans staff were kind enough to allow us an early boarding at 0600 am. 7 minutes to Kedarnath helipad & another 15 minutes track to temple & we were at our much cherished destination at 0630 am. Took priority tickets & followed a pandit ji who arranged a 'puja'. For full 15 minutes, we were at the feet of the Lord thanking him to allow us these moments. Post puja, we immediately returned to helipad, qued in for a return flight & were back at phata helipad at 0900 am. The forecast was for a rain at 0900 am & it did start raining at 0915  halting the chopper services for rest of the day. ""The LORD is where the HEART is""."
308,close to God and nature,"The kedarnath temple is something different. Austere and steeped in history, it is like no other temple in India. It's an effort to get there (the helicopter is the easier option) but one you get there, you will for sure think it was worthwhile. There are six helicipter companies flying from Phata, so you can take your pick... we didn't book in advance and got tickets quite easily."
309,Very nice spiritual experience,"Been there years ago, such a nice place.. after the natural calamity it has lost some of its beauty but the mandir is intact.. Everyone should visit once in there life.."
310,earlier the better,"Kedarnath is a holy Hindu town located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand region of North India.It is at an altitude of 3584 Mtr.[ 11759 ft ],flanked by very beautiful snow capped peaks of Himalaya.Kedarnath hosts one of the hoiliest Hindu temple "" Kedarnath Temple "" andis popular destination for Hindu pilgrims from all over the World.It is one of the 4 major pilgrim-sites [ Char  Dham ] of Uttarakhand region. Trekkers and nature lovers from different parts of the World reach Kedarnath Temple out of great respect and devotion.There are 2 ways to reach  Kedarnath ;1. By foot or on horsebacks through 14 Kms on paved path from "" Gaurikund"" , the base camp     for reaching  Kedarnath. Gaurikund is connected by road from Rishikesh , Haridwar  and    Dehradun  towns of  Uttarakhand.2. By  helicopter service from Dehradun , if weather conditions permit.Kedarnath Temple opens April End/May beginning  and  closes  October end/early November,due to extreme cold climatic conditions.Few pictures from my collection are presented.Besides being a Hindu  holy  place , Kedarnath is also nature lovers paradise. The HimalayanCharm is second to  None in the World,which is realized after visiting Kedarnath."
311,Kedarnath : A Grand Standout,picturesque scenic beauty spellbound me . That experience left me mesmerised because I did not experience  something like this before. This temple is something differentiated.
312,Journey towards Kedernath,There is positive energy in that place. An excellent place to visit at least once in a lifetime. The nature there is so beautiful and we feel Lord Shiva is so close to us. After a tough travel from Gaurikund to Kedarnath we forget our pain and are one with God.
313,A must visit pilgrimage,Unforgettable experience.. Feel blessed.. A walk of the lifetime to reach the Lord.. Please try to go at least once in this human life to experience what every devotee experiences..
314,The abode of the Hindu  deity  Lord Shiva,"One has to visit this place at least once in their lifetime. I have been there thrice, but didn't stayed for more than one night each time. You can have a feeling of being in Lord Shiva's Kailash. The snow mountains all around the Temple background is amazing. In Winter the Temple is closed for mankind. During this period it is believed that Gods and others vist this place. River Mandakini flows in Kedarnath. Adi Shankaracharya's Samadhi is present behind the Temple. This has been renovated in the year 2006 into a Big Temple complex by Swamy Swaroopanandendra of Visakhapatnam's Sharada Peetham."
315,A fitting abode to Lord Shiva!,"If your goal is to visit the temple, take a helicopter and go to the top directly with adequate cold protection clothes depending on when you go. It is not advisable to trek to the temple during may and June because it gets quite crowded. The trek route has full of pony excreta and it smells really bad. When it rains, the rain shelters get crowded and there were ponies passing through them hitting people. So if you are someone who wants to enjoy the journey and not just destination, this might not be the place for you.  I am not quite sure how the condition is during September and October when there is less crowd."
316,Gods abode,"Truly Unmatched experience. Enjoy the trekking, the view around you and then once you reach the destination, you feel blessed and near to your God."
317,In Tune with Divine,"One of the most powerful and beautiful places I have ever been to. The walk up was a challenge, but there are ponies available to hire at almost any point if you really feel that you are not coping. To sit in the presence of God in this temple is something that I will never forget, well worth the effort to get there. The mountains in the background just add to the majesty. Truly amazing!!"
318,The clam prevails,"Great place to be here.. excellent irrespective of age.... Every visit gives peace of mind and take one step closure to supreme God.. Jai Bole Nath... Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open only between the end of April (Akshaya Tritriya) to Kartik Purnima (the autumn full moon, usually end of October)."
319,Visit at the beginning or end of season for great darshans!,One of the best piligrimages on earth. You will come rejuvenated for sure. The trek from Gaurikubd to Kedarnath temple is breathtakingly beautiful. Avoid the horse ride and go on foot. Travel light and avoid the night walk. Start early morning and you will arrive by mid day. I advise an overnight stay to experience the passing time over the course of 24 hours. There the something magical about Kedarnath which every traveller must experience at least once in a lifetime.
320,The house of Shiva,"One can either walk up , or take a pony, or carried in a basket (called ""pithoo"") or in a palanquin (doliee) or you may choose for a 8 min Helicopter ride to reach Kedar mandir , at app 12000 feet . Is cold and icy winds blow in that area. A long que (in summer it can mean 4-5 hours wait) you may face . Best way is to sleep there in good govt tents (book online GMVN site) and visit early say 4am when Lines restart to form again and you can get ""darshan"" of Lord in few minutes only. I took a video while doing the trek which can be seen on You tube by typing kedarnath trek by Gurtoo"
321,Amazing weather,What ever it may be in ur life.... If u wise to go for a journey where u can explore itself or inner self.... This is the right place..... Pure... Natural... Spiritual... Positive..... Must visit this place and check all the quality with regards to lord Shiva in ur life.... And u will get answer to many of the things....Other then that the place is good... Very cold.... Its not a easy way to travel on this road...
322,Kedarnath Dham-Ultimate spiritual place,"If you are a nature lover, avoid choppers and go on foot. The place has its own divinity. Do not believe in milestones as the distances are wrongly mentioned. Do not fall for 14 kms distance, it is actually more than 20 kms. Glaciers, rivers will keep you enthusiastic throughout the way."
323,temple with the most beautiful scenery in India,I will strongly recommend the following 1)Take a helicopter if you are above 55 years - do advance booking 2) Stay overnight to enjoy the mesmerising view of Mandir lit at night - We stayed at Punjab Sind Awas - bear & clean rooms 3) Participate in the Sampurna Aarti in the evening & the Sodasopachar puja in the morning - no Maha Abhishek or Rudra Abhishek is done in May & June - Tickets for both these pujas can be attained at the ticket counter4) Sampurna Aarti only 20 seats you get to sit near Lord Almighty for 1 hour 5) Sodasopachar Puja - you get to do Abhishek & Puja for 30-45 mins - normally 3-4 families perform at same time 6)Be generous to Pandits- this is their only livelihood 7)This is once in a life time experience so take part in atleast the above 2 Pujas 8)Book helicopter tickets for morning hours as weather changes after 12 noon - mornings always sunny 9) Keep one extra day in the itinerary if travelling by helicopter- as sometime the flights are cancelled 10)May/ June best season Har Har Mahadev !!!!
324,Most Beautiful place i've ever visited,"The whole atmosphere changes once you begin your climb upwards. The trek, whichever way you make it, is an experience by itself. The people are friendly and the views splendid. Adequate facilities are available all along the route. Lot of development work is happening around the temple. The area was clean. One becomes nostalgic when one sees the damage caused by the 2013 floods. One must experience the bliss of Kedarnath."
